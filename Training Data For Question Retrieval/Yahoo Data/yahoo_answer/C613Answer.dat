5N3odm3Qaa	If your parents hate him and he's acting like this at such a vulnerable time for you, he's a POS.    I've had that guy and I broke up with that guy. There are WAY better ones out there.    There is no such thing as "the one." It's more like "the many." It may be incredibly difficult but speaking to a psychiatrist may help. If he won't do that, he has got to go.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Was married to the same type of behavior...(not anymore) And, guess what??? - they only know what they know, which to them is OK, nothing wrong... and they don't change so there isn't anything you can "do".  Is it right? - in your eyes it isn't or you wouldn't be here complaining. To him it's as normal as night & day. Either figure out how to keep him happy & content or ask him to leave for a while, while you get through this with Your dad.  Oh & btw - it will be even worse if your dad doesn't beat the cancer. You will be going through your grief alone as well...|`|WrUTuQdlaa	You need to write a note to him stating all you do here.  Some people need facts in writing.  Now if after that he's still a no. time for leaving.|`|AA10824548	keep  going to see your dad.Your husband is being childish if he can't understand ooh well he can deal with it or leave.
Kh9Wzrhyaa	It's amazing how many questions we get that are exactly like this. I think it speaks volumes about how desperately people want to become the "ideal." Here's the truth, partners come and go. You have to be true to yourself. Find your inner-happiness. Once you have, you will find that you can accept people into your life on your terms, without the unrealistic expectations that someone can be the source of your happiness. Confidence is always attractive. So is a woman that does not need a man in her life to be happy. The most important commitment you will make in your life has to be to yourself. Once you've done so, all the following relationships will be healthier. Believe in yourself, hon!

GokGEXfiaa	you are not unreasonable, you are stupid.    and whats with the baby factory? ffs...you people!!!!|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	If someone is living in your house and old enough to work (if under 18 then old enough to work without hurting their schooling) then they should be helping with bills.    Simple, easy, and straight forward. If you can work you should help with bills.|`|09zVUMBRaa	You are not being unreasonable, you're not being rational, either.  You use the words thoughtful, loving & honest to describe him.  A thoughtful, loving person who's honest to himself & to you about this situation wouldn't let you shoulder this alone.  I feel you need to sit him down for a heart to heart.  It doesn't have to be confrontational.  Bring up the fact that if he lived someplace else he would most likely be paying rent & other bills.  Tell him you're not expecting him to take care of your kids, but that he should pay his own way & stop mooching off of you.  If he's the loving, thoughtful person you think he is he will want to right this wrong.  Good luck w/the baby!!!|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	He sounds a bit like a deadbeat. He should be volunteering to pay expenses for you.     If he's like this now, how will he be when the baby is born?|`|euFDn0FBaa	If he were a real man- he would be contributing without asking!|`|AA10824548	he don't argue because you take care of him.If he has a job he needs to pay bills or get out.If you put him out he has to start paying bills where ever he goes.You need to make sure he is not paying someone else's bills.|`|0cM0RX44aa	How can you say he's a good guy when your having his baby and he THINKS he owes NOTHING to you as for the other kids that has nothing to do with it the kids are not on aol or the phone and if they were never born the BILLS would STILL be there and he said he will find some where else to stay HELLO he would have bills so he rather be alone pay for his own **** and not help you.  YES HE SHOULD WANT TO HELP......SOUNDS LIKE AN ASSHOLE TO ME!!!!|`|1lKki83Naa	Ask yourself this question:    If you'd moved into a house that you shared with a roommate, would you tolerate that person:    a) Having a "good job" (as you say this guy does)  b) Not paying their half of the bills?    The fact that he is your boyfriend makes the fact that he is not contributing to the bills * worse * than a roommate not paying their share, not better.    And him "moving 100 miles to be with you" is not impressive, nor is it a valid excuse for not helping you.    In two relationships I've moved over 1,500 miles to make it work, and in one relationship the girl I was dating moved about 1,700 miles to be with me.    (I travel a lot)
ifgzHzA3aa	Have the shower about a month and a half to two months before the wedding ceremony.|`|AA10975867	You need to find someone where she is living to host a shower and send her some $$$ to help out plus your gift. It should be at least a month ahead so she can send out her thank you cards before wedding gifts start to arrive. A lot of people won't buy a nice wedding gift if their shower gift has not been acknowledged. The alternative, if you have a lot of close female relatives and friends who are all distant is to have an "Absent -tea" shower. You choose a hostess at the location where the bride is, arrange for guests to mail gifts or have stores deliver gifts to that one address at least two weeks ahead of the shower date, and your friend goes to the hostess' place for a small luncheon and opens the gifts, takes photos, accepts phone calls from absent guests. Sometimes a bride is very popular but due to school or work or travel, a central shower is not possible and yet friends really want to shower her with things. I've hosted one of these and sent gifts to two of them. The bride sent a photo of herself opening my gift in her thank you note. In my family, we don't need to be fed to send a gift when we love someone!|`|sGP6s7uraa	My cousin had the same problem.  She lived in Tennessee and everyone else was coming in from across the country.  She chose to have the shower the night before her wedding.  They did a dinner at 4, her shower between 7 and 8 and then squeezed in her rehearsal for the next day at 9ish.  The guys drank downstairs and the women stayed upstairs.  It was actually alot of fun.  The wedding didn't start until 3 the next day so she got plenty of rest.    Edit - family is all in the same state.  My wedding date is May 9 and they are doing the shower March 21, if that helps :)|`|Qi00wt3Taa	Since you all live in TN, you should have it there.  Anytime in the 6 months leading up to the wedding would be fine.  The closer you get to the wedding, the more stressed the bride will be.  Also, she will get more gifts if it is not too close to the wedding and more people that cannot make it to the wedding may be able to participate.|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	The best bet is to 1) have it when at a time most convenient for those invited and 2) at least two months prior to the wedding.  At least that's what I've been told.  I had mine two months exactly from the wedding.|`|4e7396814e6ad0f7293c08e793cf2a20aa	U can have a couple of showers and can start around 2 months before wedding.  I had people coming in from out of town so i had several showers in my home town and had a  couples shower with my moms family in their hometown and had a nother in my husbands families town. did the same for our baby showers that way everyone has a chance to do something.
xy9JYtkTaa	tell her how much it would meant to you if she would let you go.  let her know all the facts about it, and while you're doing that, say what the school you're going to now doesn't have.  && tell her you will get a job to help pay for gas (even if gas isn't that expensive, they still want to know that you're willing to work for it)  and tell her these are the most important years of your life. and you want to enjoy them...in a place that you like, not a place that you hate.  and tell her how you'll do better in school there, because you'd get a better educationnnnnn.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	Trust me, you get that whore wasted and she'll agree to anything|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Sell it on the academics angle and 50 minutes in a car may be a path to a solid college.

Keep talking about how much happy you'll be there and that you need a "fresh start"|`|ZF02ozgLaa	why not try getting some info together and show her that thats a better school for you to go to and stuff like that... i learned at a small age how to talk to my parents!  :D|`|AA10824548	you are wrong to want mom to drive you to and from school everyday.You may hate everyone at your new school.You may not like the teachers,etc what if mom's car break down you will end up failing.|`|IKxcvkbUaa	tell your mom that the school you are going to now is highly toxic|`|mxrlZEweaa	Just give her a list of all the pros on the school that you want to go to.

Why would you need to convince her?    ITs your choice anyway, she shouldn't have the right to tell you which school you can or cant go to.|`|kOH8gDkKaa	I think you should probably learn to deal with your problems at your current school. That would be the best thing for you. To convince your Mom, you should give her the facts about the school you want to go to and leave your problems with your current school out of it. I'm sure your Mom will want you to deal with your problems yourself and not run away from them. Give a little too for example: Offer to take the bus or ride your bike to school. Say something that will not involve her spending more money or cause her stress. Think about everything that you tell her and make sure that you see her side before you say anything.    Hope this helps.|`|JPlVt9xYaa	First thing to think about is how much of a hardship would this be for your mom. It will be expensive, lots of wear and tear on the car etc. After you have thought about that, and the inconvenience it would be to a very dedicated mom, then think about qualifications.    It is a top school, are you a top student? Do you make the excellent effort to do your best? If you do, the school will want you to come there anyway, schools are always looking for good students.    If you decide you want to go, your mom agrees, the school will accept you, you still have to think about why you want to leave the first school. Many times, the cause of the problem goes with us when we run away. At your age and grade level, you are capable of making the right decision. Put the facts on the table, examine you own motives and enlist the aid of your mother. Good luck.|`|SmF9yU2Eaa	hey give her the facts! tell her how u feel and like u said top in the NATION??? u might as well print an article off the web that proves so! good luck! i totally get where youre comin from|`|G0cy2p2Saa	The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Are you going for the social aspect or the education? Consider too that if it's one of the top private schools in the nation, that probably means its very expensive. While your mom may love the fact that you want to go to a great school, she may not be able to afford this private education while saving for your college.|`|jwURGwAHaa	What I would do is to sit your mom down and seriously have a talk with her. You can also make a powerpoint of all the reasons why you should go to this school. Tell your mom that you could pay for the weekly gas bill as part of your allowance!        Good luck!!!|`|5bHHlH73aa	well.......uh.......here is an idea..........as a menmer of tthe debate club of my school i sugest evidence........the school ya say is a top 5 right? you have to tell her the advanteges of your dream school and the disadvanteges of your current school and that is all the advice i have to offer|`|01pBf4vhaa	Tell her ALL the good thing make it sound perfect and talk all about educational benefits from it!!^^
elSUVcaZaa	Believe me, if he had a second woman to go to he would divide his time between the two of you when he was feeling down. don't fall for the trap of getting back with him just because he shows you affection. you have to make decisions using more objective reasoning. I understand what you mean about feeling unsatisfied with no commitment in recent relationships, but you've got to focus on the road ahead, not looking back.  Good luck!|`|tXSmJDr0aa	What do you do when he breaks up with them?  Do you let him come back to you?  If you don't, then he's probably just doing it because he's lonely.  He obviously doesn't mean it otherwise he'd be with you and stay with you instead of going to find another woman to be with.
5N3odm3Qaa	It's pretty much a luxury that every humans can enjoy -- warmth (unless you like some kinky stuff), closeness, touching, and an orgasm to boot.    And it will usually cost close to nothing. Both the rich and poor can enjoy sex the same way. Unlike chocolate, you can almost never get sick of sex.    If you're truly comfortable with a person and you enjoy them enough to call them the highlight of your day, you've got something special. Granted, it would be great if you felt a deep love for them as well. But in the absence of true love, amazing sex can be as important as blood in our veins and food in our bellies.|`|PIQeh6kCaa	Because it's a true pleasure. It's something we're motivated to do. It's a fantasy come reality. It's a start that we know we will enjoy the journey and almosy always, the end.    Sex rocks!!!|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Basic Biology. You should study it. Humans are driven to secure food, shelter, and to reproduce. Nothing else matters when one of those three is lacking. It is not just the hour and a half. It is a lifelong drive.

It's sounds like your going to be planning a wedding really soon!! I know what you mean by not wanting to wait, my boyfriend told me he is popping the question sometime this month!! I'm not expecting it to be on Valentines day because he's going to be broke around that time (hhmmm... well that's what he's making me believe anyways, lol!) So yeah, I'm thinking you guy will probably do it on Valentines Day!!   Ok, just try not to think about it, and love the surprise!!     Good luck and God bless you're up coming marriage!!|`|scTpO8Enaa	Obviousley he's going to propose at some point otherwise the trip for the ring and payments etc wouldn't have happened - guys don't generally play games like that.  It usually happens when you least expect it and, because most of the suprise has gone anwyay, I'd just forget about it all for now.  When it happens it happens and there's no point stressing over it when you know he's going to propose at some point anyway.|`|VSWl45cKaa	How can anyone "out here" answer that?  He alone controls the date. If he is paying for a ring then he is committed. Maybe he wants to be fiscally responsible and pay it off.  In any case, most of the surprise is already gone.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	not a single one of us is going to be able to answer this because we are not your boyfriend.  we dont know your life details or anything about you or your relationship beyond the few snippits youve told us/    why not sit back and wait and let it be a proper surprise?|`|AA10975867	If a man is just "stringing you along", he doesn't take you to select a ring and make payments on it. Stop bugging him and relax. Better that he has the thing paid in full than propose early and start a marriage in debt for a piece of jewellery.|`|BlVudiyfaa	HE will propose at the next new moon.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Please get a hobby and stop talking like a Hallmark card.

They have more of a selection and also warranties, replacement plans etc. If you want to go cheap go to a diamond excange or pawn shop.|`|iN27E3WCaa	Stay away from chains like Zales or Kay's.  Those stores only have one kind of diamond in stock - the kind that's overpriced and of poor quality.    A local jeweler would be a good place to go because they'd probably be more helpful and their markups wouldn't be outrageous.    Another option you haven't listed would be an online retailer, like Blue Nile.  My husband bought my ring through Union Diamond, another online retailer, and it's amazing.  He actually paid only 75% of the appraised value, and the stone has excellent specs.  You can go to various stores to look at styles and see how stones with different specs (4 c's) compare, but buying online is a great option.  Blue Nile even offers free return shipping in case you're not satisfied with your purchase.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I would not buy from Zales - their creditors are seeking bankruptcy!      http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.ht...    I would avoid Kay jewelers as well.  Their diamonds are way overpriced and are not excellent quality.  I prefer sites like bluenile.com.  They have articles on the "4 C's" right there on their website.  You can read up and learn about what color, clarity, and cut are best for you and in your price range.  They (by far) have the most reasonable prices anywhere, especially when you consider there is no sales tax on your diamond purchase!  Right now, they are having a 10% discount on the setting and on all premade jewelry.  But, you can use their "build a ring" feature to create a unique ring that's in your budget.  Check them out!    www.bluenile.com|`|GOvZ1wi0aa	Tiffany's    Jared's|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Small private importer. You'll get better quality, better service and better prices.

You would have had to have agreed to her being a "friend" on there so just delete her. Turn her in to MSN for harassment. Get caller ID and when she calls just don't answer or see if it's possible to get certain phone numbers blocked by the phone company or cell provider.  If she's really being abusive you could also consider getting a restraining order against her. The court could order her to have no contact with you or face jail time.  Good luck.

cGbTJobeaa	Weddings nowadays aren't that much different than they were when she got married. The core components are always the same.  Invitations, ceremony, flowers, photographer, reception, dinner, drinking, dancing, cake.    Tell your Nana that the advice my priest gave me is:  the most significant part of any wedding is the exchanging of vows between the bride and groom.  Everything else is fluff.  It is up to the bride and groom to decide how much fluff to have...or not have.    So...if your Nana and your dad's fiance stick to what they know and the core essentials and are thoughtful of the guests' needs and comfort while filling the bride's vision, it will still be a lovely wedding.|`|sGP6s7uraa	They do unity sand now sometimes instead of a unity candle.    More info would be helpful like "How do you decorate?" "What is usually said during a 'modern ceremony'?"  infoinfoinfo|`|7MkTM1jQaa	Just to build on the previous answer, the Unity Sand ceremony is beautiful and its a memorable keepsake. If you could provide more info that would be great and we would be able to help alot more. And on a side note I admire your strength. I know from some of your previous questions that you're not happy with this wedding, but way to keep on keeping on. Keep your chin up soldier, theres a war to win.      Cheers,  Silver|`|7HVsVspOaa	Send her to my website. There are many many sample ceremonies there.     http://www.churchofancientways.org    There's also readings, video, FAQ, articles... It will give her a lot to think about!
pluPzfVMaa	No, I doubt it would make him feel awkward since he calls you that.     Just call him one day and say "Hey sexy, whats up?" =) It will be a nice little reminder that you're attracted to him.|`|ayMFBxvraa	of course you can! I tell mine it all the time ;) they love it|`|yzFxc5uXaa	since your even asking this question im gonna go ahead an assume your about 14... so no don't call him sexy, your both children and children arent sexy|`|B71aG4mraa	no|`|rqlLTEKzaa	If it's okay for him to call you sexy its ok for you to call him sexy|`|SjZwaYqYaa	sure, why not|`|lSl2Arlpaa	lol the guy im seeing does the same thing...try saying it to him! he'l probably like it :)|`|krDqGelIaa	Yes.  Yes you can.|`|5owT5hjWaa	its definitely not weird at all, go ahead and call each other whatever you want. I call my girlfriend Sexy all the time when i text her, and she does the same to me, its totally fine with me|`|K8rv2f2Iaa	if hes hot yes if he is ugly break up with him!!|`|llQwjX5Raa	I guess but I don't really know sorry. My nickname is sexy too!|`|AA11945637	yup|`|SPSuhBFbaa	it depends on how long you have known him.|`|ZbXiw5gdaa	no its not wierd i would think of something else tho.. but no its fine to call him that.|`|oadMJWOCaa	call him the complete oppisite itll be funny|`|xy4z8bQraa	if you want to.|`|GjvspMkQaa	he will love it if you do, now give me best answer of making ur life better|`|4sK0aJlDaa	no|`|EjfJaNn7aa	yeah, i dont see why not|`|iAphlpqKaa	yeah for sure, especially if you mean it!|`|avpv7u8saa	No when he calls you Sexy you have to call him Ugly duh!
8XKmMBU7aa	Yes please, you are right, it's your sisters day, so she will choose who wants right but if she will not choose any one person in between you then it's your insult also. It's bad for her that she did not asked from you. OMG  I don't find any Joke on your sister.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Why would you have a 4 year old for a bridesmaid and further, why would a 7 year old be a bridesmaid?  I can only assume you are referring to a flowergirl.  No, she does not have to ask the 2nd cousin to be in the wedding.  WHy would you assume that your cousin will be upset about it?  And if she is, so what?  She'll get over it.  Seriously, if people hold grudges or get all bent out of shape because of these things, it's just ridiculous.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	1. Bridesmaids are of marriageable ages usually--not 7 and 4.  2. Does your sister WANT this little girl to be in the bridal party as a flower girl or not?    3. Is your sister punishing your cousin or your cousin's daughter for not being maid a bridesmaid 6 years ago?  4. If your sister has a good enough relationship in which she wants to have this 4 year old in the wedding party, then she should be adult enough to let go of what happened in the past--you don't know why you two weren't made BMs and to carry a grudge about something like this is completely childishness.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	Does she have a flower girl picked out yet?  If not, that would be a good place to include the 4 year old if she wants to.  I do not think it is necessary.  I also don't think it has anything to do with you cousin not having her in her wedding.|`|TjNMabEIaa	It is your sisters day and she should decide how many and how are the bridesmaids.  You cousin isn`t that close a relation so it really should not matter too much.  If she causes a scene, she doesn`t even need to attend the wedding.|`|cwFOKMBBaa	It's her wedding so it shouldn't matter who's gonna get funny about who being bridesmaid. Just have the original people who were going to be bridesmaids and forget your cousin's kids. It would be different if you were bride maids at your cousins wedding but they never asked you so why should they be bridesmaid to your sister! Don't worry about it it will be fine!|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	Like you said, if she never asked any of you's to be in her bridal party you are under no obligation at all to ask her daughter. Its your sisters big day and she should have it the way she wants it, why go to the extra expense just to please others. If your cousin is any kind of friend she'll understand x|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Why would anyone ask a 4-year-old to be a bridesmaid? That's flower-girl age, not bridesmaid age. BM are typically of marrying age, hence the "maids in waiting" reference. No 4-year-old BM, no. She's not obligated to ask anyone, she can have whoever she wants. If anything that kid could be a flower girl but if your sis doesn't want her to be, it's not necessary.    Good luck!|`|93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	it is your sisters wedding and she can have whoever she wants be her bridesmaids. don't worry about other people, you can please them all anyway, she needs to go with what makes her happy! :)|`|da8d3fa7a075907fff1a655c9a107079aa	Perhaps your sisters budget didn't stretch to you.  Who is she punishing....sister or 4 yr old child?  Tell her to do the right thing and have the little girl as a bridesmaid...it isn't her fault.|`|SZdT1r8saa	Who cares what anyone thinks!?!?  It's your sister's day.  I wouldn't worry about what your cousin is going to think.|`|A7mAUaxgaa	Simple Answer:    It's your sister's wedding.  SHE (and her fiancee') get to choose who is in the wedding party.  If she doesn't want anyone from the cousin's family to be in it, that is her choice.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Are you sure you don't mean flower girl? Why in heaven's name would anyone have a 4 or 7 year old bridesmaid? 7 is young even for a junior bridesmaid unless she's the bride's daughter.|`|9IRup1jHaa	You have summed it up in 1 its your sisters day and her final choice, your cousin obviously didnt feel funny about not having you two as bridesmaids so why should it even enter her head that your sister is being funny by not having her daughter! If anyone does make a comment you and your sister can always say you didnt make a fuss when she chose so why should she now!  It can get out of hand trying to please everyone else its her day that she wants to remember positively!! Other people should be mature enough to see that!|`|xWTRlXiNaa	sometimes it doesnt matter what we do someone will always take the hump. Do what is right for yourself and what will make you both happy.|`|o2pb32q5aa	as you say, its your sisters day and its up to her and her fiance who they choose for their bridesmaids, anyway i think 6 bridesmaids is enough,|`|7MkTM1jQaa	First of all, Congrats on your sisters wedding!      Now to answer the question, as you said it, its the Bride's day, and she can choose whomever she wants as a bridesmaid. She already has her hands full with 6 bridesmaids! If there is a space open for a flower girl then your sister may want to consider the little one for that position, but a 4 year old bridesmaid? I know it's been done, but usually as a bride's choice, not because the girl's mother wants her to be one. Your cousin decided not to have you two as her bridesmaids, and that was a decision she made and you respected. The same way, your sister is choosing her bridesmaids and already has enough bridesmaids, and in all fairness your cousin should respect this decision aswell. Good luck, and just remember, its the Bride's day, not your cousins!     Cheers!  Silver|`|YS6G7Vevaa	Its your sisters day so she should decided who she has along with lots of other things. Just make sure she makes it clear to your cousin who her bridesmaids are and that she wont be having any more. Your sister should do everything that she wants because shes only going to do it once and it should be everything she has ever dreamt about. Hope it all goes well.|`|F8iYNurEaa	Uh, hello everybody?! This question isn't about punishing a little girl out of spite. She wants to know if her sister is obligated to have the little girl as a flowergirl/bridesmaid.    The answer is no. It is your sister's wedding and she can have who she wants to be BM. If your cousin gets annoyed by this then that is her problem. In my experience, you seem to annoy people whatever you do when planning a wedding, so do what you want, not what others want you to do. You can't please everyone.
afI03mJXaa	Wow how exciting. hehe. My bday is on March 14th also and my fiance proposed to me at exactly midnight with would be the 15th because that was the day we got together. And he did it in the exact place we had our first date (sighhhh) that will be one year ago soon.lol. So maybe he will propose to you on your bday. so if he doesn't have a gift for you its probably because of the ring. ;) Its ok to be nervous you'll feel that when your wedding day gets closer. I know i do. Ours is on May 15th of this year. Good Luck and congrats. Let us know when it happens lol.|`|QuiilSYGaa	my girlfriends' birthday is march 14 too!|`|dUqgiKBPaa	i want to say one thing....DONT EXPECT IT!  i loved being surprised!! i lovednot knowing or not expecting, so just hope that you get it for now but then forget about it! it will be better!  good luck i hope you get what you want, try to be happy andnot fight cause then he wont try to procrastiate any, show him how happy he can be with you|`|oS1TBzL6aa	It sounds like you are planning on saying yes so there is nothing to be nervous about; no hurt feelings, wasted time, flipping out.  Just go with the flow until it happens and congratulations.    Cheers,  A.T. Cunningham|`|UvY5adFAaa	I would act surprised if he does propose :D   I can tell something is up... Stay discreet, and make sure he doesn't think you know :D|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Do you love him? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with him? Does he make you happy? Does he complete you in every way? Are you in love with him? If yes, to these questions, you're ready to marry him.
7MkTM1jQaa	You can have anyone you want give you away and I think having your mother give you away would be incredibly sweet. I've seen weddings where the mother gave her daughter away, and its perfectly acceptable. You can also have an uncle, cousin, brother, bestest friend, pretty much anyone who you think should be giving you away, whoever you are closest to. And if that's your mother, that that's perfectly fine. Good luck and congrats! Hope I helped!    Cheers!  Silver|`|4c988b1f1dbba6558aaf1b4303565c38aa	I'm sure your mom would be honored to 'give you away', and it's perfectly appropriate.  Anyone who knows you & cares about you would completely understand, and they wouldn't care.|`|OTBv9AsBaa	Have you thought about just not getting married at all? I'm single and I love singlehood.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	Mom is a great idea...do you have a brother or an uncle who is special to you?  That would be another option.  But, I think your mom would be honored.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	Your mother would be good. What about an uncle, brother, cousin, best guy friend. Anyone along those lines would work. It seems as though you were picking people who were very close to you so you could choose your mom and she could give you away she would love that. I wish you the best. and congrats on getting married.|`|CjafsNslaa	No its not weird. You can have your mother walk you down if you want. Instead of thinking about what other people think, just think about what would make you happy. Then you can have a mother daughter dance too!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I agree anyone in your family could do it. its normal and ppl would understand..    im not haveing anyone walk with me.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Your mother, your grandmother, your self.  If you walk down your self, you could have your FH meet you half way :)|`|SZdT1r8saa	I don't think it's weird at all that your mom would give you away.  Seems more appropriate really.  But no one really has to walk you down the aisle.  It's up to you.  I think having your mom walk with you would be really nice.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Anyone can walk you down the aisle: mother, brother, sister, cousin, uncle - anyone. It doesn't have to be a man, it can be a woman or more than one person. Or, you could go it alone. Choose someone who is meaningful to you and has had a large impact on your life.    Good luck!|`|W2VVvOgIaa	Maybe his dad, or your uncle? I would have my mom or my aunt...it could be whoever you want, its your wedding...who was most special to you...i know they may be gone now and that does make it difficult. I understand because i'm a single parent and i always think of maybe someday i will get married, and who would walk me down the aisle then? Dont' worry it will all work out for the good. Have a beautiful wedding, and congrats!|`|5kwKeWsbaa	Its your day,  you can have anyone you want walk you down the aisle.  I was at a wedding last summer where the mom walked the daughter down the aisle.  They also danced the Mother / Daughter dance.  It was very sweet and not weird at all.      The father of the bride was no longer in the picture and the Bride did not want to miss out on that part of the ceremony/ tradition.|`|qJzPQWDqaa	Definelty not, have you asked your mom, im sure she would love to do, i went to a wedding, where her dad  had died a few months before the wedding, her mom ended up walking her down the isle. I was a wedding consultant last year, you would be surprised how many mother wanna walk their daughters down the isle. Good luck.|`|A7mAUaxgaa	I think your Mother would be honored to do such a thing.  Anymore it is not uncommon for a Mother to walk her Daughter down the isle.  If that is what you want, it's your wedding, do it! :D|`|5bqzuJntaa	No way not at all. If you wanted your mom to do it that would be totally fine. A lot of people have either both parents, or just their mom do it. If you have a brother that would be really cute too. If you guys are close of course!|`|27dsbJKbaa	When I get married I will have my brother walk me because he has been like a father to me. If I did not have my brother it would def be my mom because she played both the mother and father role in my life due to an absentee "father"
a6j0cwgqaa	"For all time" by Soluna! I love that song! It will play at my wedding!  "I love you always forever" by Donna Lewis its also a favorite!  "I'm amazed by you by Lone Star"!!! = PURE ROMANCE!     There are some pretty neat songs from Disney movies and love flicks too  its you call though, these are just a few songs I'm putting in my wedding mix! Best of luck|`|nqINitkmaa	a really cute song is I want to grow old with you- by Adam Sandler. Its really cute, its the song that he sang to Julia on the airplane in the Wedding Singer.    Here are the lyrics, he repeats them a few times I think the song is just over 2 minuets long.    I wanna make you smile whenever youre sad  Carry you around when your arthritis is bad  All I wanna do is grow old with you    Ill get your medicine when your tummy aches  Build you a fire if the furnace breaks  Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you    Ill miss you  Ill kiss you  Give you my coat when you are cold    Ill need you  Ill feed you  Even let ya hold the remote control    So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink  Put you to bed if youve had too much to drink  I could be the man who grows old with you  I wanna grow old with you|`|RKsn5dD4aa	meet me at the altar - jagged edge
AW1dCzH0aa	Typically, I think it's only the actual hostess who gets a gift.  If they are co-hostesses, then I'd get them both one.  But, I wouldn't feel obligated to get gifts for the bridesmaids if they didn't do much.  You'll still be giving them something for the wedding, so it should be fine!|`|sGP6s7uraa	I didn't know you were supposed to give gifts to those hosting the shower.  It's usually the BM's, MOH and a mother or two.  I know that you give WEDDING gifts but I knew nothing about bridal shower gifts.  Maybe just give a gift to the two hosts.  In private.  Still give the BM's their wedding gift, though.|`|5kwKeWsbaa	I have never heard of giving a gift as a thank you for the shower, but if you feel strongly about it the gifts should go to the individuals who helped financially or physically.|`|A7mAUaxgaa	Like the others before me, I've never heard of giving a gift as a thank you for hosting your shower.  If you feel you have to do something, a simple hand-written card would be perfect thanking them for their efforts.|`|BOgfHEqqaa	I don't think you need to give a gift at all. Maybe you should just have a dinner or something with the MOH and friend, and thank them while you are there, so that they know how much you appreciate it.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Usually the bride just makes a speech at the end of the shower thanking everyone for coming and then expresses a special thank you to the hosts of the shower.  I have never received a thank you gift for hosting a shower for someone, nor have I expected one.  If you really feel you want to send flowers to the homes that way you don't have to worry about the "hey where's my gift?" look you may get.
bRjq7xZ5aa	i worry about the same things too...because my mom emotionally abused me, so, personally, i'd tell my daughter that, if there ever comes a time that she wants to talk to me about something that's depressing her, then she can choose when whether or not she wants to come and talk to me. even if she chooses not to tell me, i would let her know that i'd always be there for her when she's ready. i think letting your children know that you'll be there even when no-one else will be is the most comforting thing you can tell them without encroaching in their personal territory.|`|0cM0RX44aa	My mother was an alcoholic and still is but we are nothing to each Other she walked out the door almost 5 years ago and haven't seen her since the worst part is she still tries to get back for my (alcoholic father) but wont ask about her 2 adult children! The other lady is right you just have to talk and let her know your here for her. I think being like a SOME WHAT friend in the sense of making sure she's comfortable with you she can express herself, and act silly.  Good Luck.....it's not hard you will do just find specially knowing you been through hell with your mother you'll know the mistakes NOT to make.
b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	He proposed May of 06, we were married May 08, and we started planning and getting everything together in January 08.|`|nqINitkmaa	About a week after he proposed we started looking at venues. We knew we wanted a destination wedding so we started looking at destinations. We got engaged in september 2008 and will be married august 2009.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Right away; we were married in 4 months.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	I waited 2 months before planning. We wanted a couple months to just sit and relax and enjoy being in the state of engagement before diving into planning. So, I bought dozens of bridal magazines and browsed, and daydreamed for those 2 months, and my husband and I did a lot of talking about things we liked, so when the time came to actually plan, we were really on the same page.|`|0Id85yiYaa	asap|`|OXNiEDROaa	I got engaged in Nov 1989, got my dress in Jan 1990 Married May 12 1990|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We set a date within a few weeks once we could book the officiant, venue and caterer - and were lucky to have it only eight months away, so that's how long we were engaged.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	no, we were engaged for years before we actually got married.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Most women start planning there wedding ideals at the age of 13 then once the question was popped to my wife it was the next week she was planning (i wasn't allowed to)|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	after calling everyone|`|Ydl1B5OMaa	My fiancee and I have had a long engagement.

However, its NEVER too early to start planning, especially around the holidays because EVERYONE gets engaged around Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Valentines Day and venues start filling up fast! Even years before. I booked the venue last July and have been gradually setting things up since then. Good Luck!|`|8kdjvWAxaa	i began the day after he proposed. I wrote out who was going to be in my wedding and signing myself up for every magazine, giveaways, etc. We even set up an wedding bank account. we have been adding money in since, my family have so our budget is a lot of money and plus my parents are paying for some of the stuff.|`|woOeYFrEaa	Ha!  My husband still teases me about this.  We'd been ring shopping so I knew it was happening soon.  My little sister was coming in from out of town for the weekend and really wanted to go dress shopping with me, even though I didn't officially have the ring.    I met up with him the day before my dress appointment and told him about it and asked if it was ok.  He agreed to it and gave me a hard time about it and about 3 hours later surprised me with the ring. ;)    I'd imagine most women if they were honest would admit that as soon as things started heading towards engagement they started planning stuff even if it was just ideas they didn't write down.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Immediately.  First with the date and it snowballed from there.|`|7CKipTZOaa	we were engaged in december, and we started planning last week, ceremony is in August|`|0fFaXhIIaa	You will need to start thinking about when you want to get married.

EZ5mwUF3aa	If you want to lose weight you should do it for YOU and your health, everything else will fall into place.  The easiest way to lose weight is to eat less and move more. Instead of eating 3 meals a day, eat 5 very small meals through out the day, your metabolism will stay up and you will burn fat.  Replace candy/snack food with fruit.  Good luck!|`|BlVudiyfaa	If she's got issues with your weight, forget her. She's not real. Maybe years from now, when she realizes you were a person and not an object, things might be different.    In the meantime, just be her freind. Show her that, indeed, you are a real person, and a good one, too.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	It's going to take you a while to lose weight.  It took you a little while to put it on right?  So while you're eating less and moving more, you can try to find out if she likes you.  Maybe you could ask her out and see what she says.  Or you could invite her to go workout with you.  Anyone who doesn't like you based on your weight is somone you don't want to be with.  But maybe she does want to be with you and you're just being insecure.|`|XJGp4AxHaa	First don't change for anybody because love and all of that should not be based on that. But if you want to lose weight exercise hard and eat healthy. When you go to the gym make sure that you are do things right. Make the most out of your time. Get to sweating and don't let it stop till your done. I would say try two hours. That's what I use to do. Eat right after though since your body will digest it better.|`|ZaRSibxvaa	If she dont like you for who you really are then you dont even deserve her|`|71VRvldJaa	You don't lose weight because of a girl!  You lose weight because you want to be strong and healthy and not setting yourself up for serious health issues as you get older.  However, if she doesn't like you the way you are, I wouldn't be bothered with her.  If you're serious about getting the weight off, cut out fast foods, junk food, soft drinks and replace those things with fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry.  Snack on carrot and celery sticks  Depend where you live you can ride a bike, walk, swim, skate, cross country ski, etc......anything that gets you moving!|`|fIbamd52aa	dont change yourself for anybody!! you should only go for someone who likes you for you|`|b2zSN7wkaa	go to the gym and eat healthy.|`|oXXFo2ATaa	go on a diet?|`|jHa4B1NWaa	tHIS GIRL ISNT FOR YOU SHE SHOULD LIKE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE NOT YOUR WEIGHT|`|rn2chc2taa	are you friends if so than your appearance doesn't matter go for it|`|S23HcsGJaa	You can start working out and lifting weights so that you can turn the fat into muscle. You can work on having a healthier diet. These things wont cause any immediate changes so I suggest you find someone that will like you for the person that you are now otherwise you will find youself unhappy in the long run|`|iNPamc3Faa	Awww. Just exercise and eat less. But if she's so shallow that she doesn't like an overweight person, she's not worth it. But, anywho, good luck!|`|4cMuedpWaa	The easier and faster way (out of the blue) to start losing weight is running.    I know it may sound boring but it is the best thing to start with.    Don't start running like crazy though. You don't have the pace/training to start running 5 miles on the first day.    Start with a 5 minutes run (Mon, Wed, Fri) on the first two weeks, 10 minutes (same days) on the 3rd and 4th week.    After that, depending how you're feeling, you can increase/decrease the amount of running time.    If you feel good, you can start the second month with a 20 minutes run every Mon, Wed, Fri and you'll see the changes really fast.    One suggestion though.    If you're doing this, it's for yourself, not for someone else.    After a while, you can start with some weight lifting which can help you shaping your muscles.|`|AJh7hlhOaa	don't change yourself just for one girl. you will regret it one day. you will find a girl that will like you just for who you are.. just wait for her(:|`|5bea5b92613f998503999650d76207e1aa	Hi Max     There are so many things you can do like eat three meals a day and do alot of walking and maybe some sit ups that helps and say hi to her alot and maybe something will come out of it  good luck to you and stay fit I lost 15 pounds when I did that or go swimming to  thank you for asking
ce2dcbf43f131a2e59c8b0a492f30246aa	I HATE smiley central. It's literally the worst thing ever. I downloaded it once and it took over my whole computer. I also got those annoying cursors. Delete the installation (un-install) off your computer. Right click on the installation, and hit "uninstall." Your computer should tell you what to do from there.     Can't find where the installation is located on your computer? Go to "SEARCH" from your START button on the bottom left of your screen, SEARCH all files and folders, and type in "smiley central." That should tell you where that junk was stored in your computer.

AA11748648	Don't even go there. What an a**hole, I mean if you take him back whats gonna stop him from liking some other girl and trying to hook up with her. Make him SUFFER, show that jerk what he lost. I know it hurts because you love him but believe me he'll do it again, and again.
263465453d55a98bddb48c833b8ede1aaa	Essa  uma pergunta muito difcil de responder.  J aconteceu as duas coisas comigo.  Quando eu tra, eu era mais jovem. E n?o gostei. Senti-me mal.  Quando fui trado... a o negcio ficou feio. Isso porque envolvia amor, mas, como a gente n?o estava "oficialmente" namorando, eu nem tinha o direito de brigar por causa disso. Talves se estivesse, seria mais fcil porque a eu teria um motivo para terminar e n?o sofreria tanto.    De qualquer forma, um ou outro s?o pssimos. O ideal  n?o trair e procurar n?o estar com alguem que traia.   at possivel perdoar uma trai??o em nome do amor (quando a pessoa se arrepende e demonstra que fez uma burrada mesmo). Mas voc tem que ter a mente bastante aberta pra conviver com isso. Se voc nao esquecer da trai??o, voc n?o vai ser feliz.|`|c34613836ec16cde747ab3900e55bfd1aa	Eu acho que trair  bem pior, pois vc esta enganando a si mesmo. vc sabe de sua posi??o e ainda por cima faz uma coisa dessas, se vc gosta da pessoa que est ao seu lado vc n?o pensa em trair, se vc trai. trai a sim mesmo...|`|bbfc38b059acc09ae29f27df0a52c8e9aa	Acho que os dois s?o horrveis quando se gosta de verdade, mas ser trado e bem mais doloroso.|`|9dc6d87896f6d9c4c222c912790d79a7aa	quando se trai  mais facil aceitar o chifre.  mais os dois sao horriveis.  mais se fosse para escolher entre um dos dois  melhor trair.|`|4eaec5c6c4a55678cbfb5f07d125eda3aa	Agora bola pra frente porque n?o d pra consertar o conserto.
AA12244965	Funny you think of it that way, b/c I notice men get bored of girls too. I think it goes for both sexes. If one person is simply more adventurist and possibly suffers a short attention span, they probably do lose interest constantly. Yet, women do give up when they're with a guy and realize who he REALLY is and that he's not going to change for her. Rather sad really...but it happens. I think guys do that to girls too. It's more realistic to just notice the difference and always be honest and break up if they don't want to deal with it. Instead, they lie. Sad.|`|38f1f2503fc6c449546776a1a667e539aa	Are you just not interested in men.

AA10042451	Sounds like he might have a problem completing the job (if you know what I mean), and he is faking the orgasm sometimes.  Men fake too sometimes.  It's more rare, but they do it and can be convincing.  He might have a psychological problem that prevents him from achieving orgasm.  I would advice him to seek professional help.|`|fc4f3471e49a0e0d6b7104e775386de6aa	your gross... 2 points|`|AA11322886	i think he is faking too|`|a637d0b672c011b905c0c865bc2ea40eaa	I thinks he's got an impotency problem. He should see a urologist about that.
343c41d281ddfa665078a145b440769eaa	Maybe he is shy.   Maybe he is not sure what you would do if he did talk with you.   15 is a weird age for guys.  If your interested in him, go up to him and start talking.  You never know he could be a really nice guy.  Sounds like he has the hots for you.|`|72d0d1dec9c7a3a8444bedf2d570ce17aa	sounds like he likes u. i have a problem like that 2. me and this guy r competitive when it comes to grades. and when he gets a better grade than i do, he makes fun of me and teases me. i think he likes me and his being compettitve is his way of flirting and/or telling me he likes me. im thinking about just asking him if he does and if he really does then he'll tell me the truth. so yeah, sry for going off subject there. i think he likes u. the only way to know 4 sure is to ask him. and if he cant handle the direct approach, then maybe he likes u and doesnt know what to do about his feelings maybe? hope i was of help.

I think he realy likes you, but is to afraid to talk to you a bit more, as for the calling your name thing, well, I don't know most of the kids in my school, but even if they aren't in my classes I pick up names pretty quick. I think he is asking you about the class either becasue that's the only way he can talk to you, OR, he thinks you are really smart. =) Hope it helps.|`|4be43fd715baef23cf041754eff0275faa	transfer out of the class|`|af711a7adafd92d2cf513152a9f19c74aa	I dont get it

Do your best to learn the things that make him happy,take an interest. As you spend more time together he should begin to take an interest in some of the things you really enjoy, The key is to have communication and compromise between the two of you.

26FPzSycaa	It is a good idea, if that's what you want and you can afford it. I am not particularly fond of the idea. Favors like that are usually left at the wedding an/or just collect dust. But! You can do more like a photo FRAME an not necessarily a whole book. Nowadays, I don't print as many photos as I did before there was digital.     Other favor ideas that guests love: homemade/local goods (like honey, jam, coockies), a slice of the wedding cake, a donation made in their name to a charity that you care about, wine, coffee, etc.|`|FHtup0xEaa	I like the idea of the albums for favors i would put your picture on the cover then let them fill it as for kids and teenagers I would not invite them adult reception only|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Seems like they would be awfully expensive.

QmG2v1quaa	I think white flowers will not look good against a black sash. I think it would look really good with the watermelon colored dresses, but the black....I don't know.    I think if you could use light pinks, lime (which looks really good with that watermelon color), a light sherbet color (orange). I'm not really sure that you'll like those colors, but it's my opinion.     I like the idea of using black ribbon to wrap the flowers up!! That sounds pretty.    Congrats and good luck planning!|`|2kl0vQjVaa	Lime cymbidium orchids, watermelon roses, mango callas.  It will look awesome with the watermelon dresses.|`|sGP6s7uraa	White/Cream gerbera daisies would be nice and simple.  I think any white flowers would be a nice choice.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	wow, this is hard, since you haven't given us a 3rd color to work with or a flower you want to use.

Or hot pink, orange, and red gerbera daisy bouquets    http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...

Say, white hydrangeas, pink flowers, white/fusha orchids, hot pink calla lilies.|`|9quzOxZbaa	Sounds like an awesome color scheme...have you thought of going with an all white bouquet?  Or getting a 3rd color- like yellow or orange or blue- something that will pop off the watermelon without looking tacky?|`|xwzKlPFSaa	I'm going to be using the wooden flowers and they come in just about every color. but whites/ivory and pinks should be fine. check the wooden flowers out though they are awesome.  http://www.petalbypetal.com/|`|BMqd0fkKaa	I don't know what this flower is called in English, but this pure white flower can definitely match any colour of wedding dress.

Ah, just so you know, this flower now is also coloured in yellow, light red, light blue and also black if you want :)) hehe

Have a look at www.astro.com. You can check the details of your compatability with the astroclick partner function. It's good!|`|aACanjSiaa	you guys can work it out if you stick through... trust me astrology works :D
ePYbjPThaa	okay. first of all he probably only said that because he was nervous on wat you would say. ask him out! take control. break the ice girl. i have a boy problem too but dont worry ask him out and if it doesnt work out just move on ..... :) i wish you luck!|`|Xf9vSIixaa	You could always make him a nice card and maybe go out that night to see a movie.. I'm sure if he likes you back he wouldn't really care what you did as long as it was from you.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Make him some homemade cookies or bake cupcakes and give him a card or draw a funny Valentine.
k9RXrzluaa	My now husband and I met online. I was still living in L.A. and him in England. Been married almost 10 years and have two beautiful children. You guys are still young, give it time, get to know each other better, and see if your relationship can withstand the distance until you both have saved up enough money to meet each other face to face.|`|cceb9706a146e12177fbf5a1f4c2e97caa	i think that it could work. just be careful. now a days it is safer to pick someone on the internet than it is in a bar!|`|feUMAvgLaa	I don't think its safe. You need to be very very careful especially as a girl when it comes to online dating with all the online predators, but if your sure that this is the right person. You need to actually spend time with him in real life before you go live with him.|`|iXt3erseaa	Just be patient. If he's the right one for you,then you both will wait. You can't judge the relationship until you have met in person. I wouldn't go across the country to meet him just yet either...|`|cYFblmpVaa	i have not been in your situation but here is my opinion on it  you 2 are just be kids  enjoy it  if you get the money to see each other then good if not you will both move on  you are not is love with him you are in love with the idea of being in love with him  good luck have fun while you are young|`|jpzbDXEraa	My answer is going to sound really cheesy but... if you two were meant to be together, then the time will come... keep talking to him, or speak to your parents about it, dont get angry and tell them that your an adult now, and need to start your own life.    Ok Hope i helped hun    xxx|`|Ydl1B5OMaa	It doesnt hurt to try. Dont jump in head first though. You both are still young. Continue doing what your doing and if it continues to work out...great. Maybe in the future you can plan on meeting face-to-face. Remember the saying "absence makes the heart grow fonder."|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I know exactly how you feel. My girlfriend and I were in the same situation almost. She lived in WA and I lived in CO. She came down here first. Then I went up there a couple of times. Now we are living together and talking about getting married. As long as you feel safe with what you are doing and somebody knows where you are this first time then I would say go for it. But that was just how it worked with us. Good Luck!
sLLgERQWaa	Proper wedding etiquette demands that your MOH be at the head or bridal table with the bride & groom.If you want your MOH/sister at your head table, place her there. her personal life has nothing to do with anything and a wedding is NOT a venue to 'punish' anyone for stuff that you or your mother do not approve of.    I would tell your mother that she will NOT use your wedding to punish your sister and any attempts to do so will earn her a seat other than the head table.....or you & your guy will elope to avoid all her drama. Make it clear her boyfriend is what he is and her drama over their relationship has no place in your wedding.    Your mother should be ashamed of herself, to tell a mother in front of her children that the children (her own grand kids) were a mistake....Shame. She should be restricted from seeing them until she has an attitude adjustment, for their sake......good luck|`|AA11877439	Im sorry about all the drama. But i think that you should straight out tell your mom that although she can voice her opinion she doesn't have the authority to make any of the wedding decisions. tell her and your sister to leave the drama behind or neither of them will be invited to the wedding. worst case scenario and she does turn her family against you, talk to your grandparents, family members, etc by yourself, be friends with them if it's a big deal to you. I think you should have your sister sit at the head table if you want her to, and have her kids at the kids table. its your wedding, you do what you want and whats going to make you happy. good luck :)|`|8kdjvWAxaa	yea but i suffer from Future mother in lawzilla. Ugh girl i know what you are going through. All i can say is it's your wedding do you what you want.|`|IxoazyHUaa	Malissa E's advice is right on, she says she is young but her advice is very mature|`|dUqgiKBPaa	i love the momzilla term i have the same problem wih that  my mom is trying to do my wedding how she wants. she will go out and buy stuff without asking and book stuff with out asking and it is not what i want. i appreciate her doing it but she is changing everything    the day i told her off is the last day she did it. she has been great since. i just told her listen mom there are some things you need to realize .this is my wedding and i want it to be my wedding, pretty much ya know ;)|`|nvhCAIKgaa	Wow, thats some real problems. I think that your mother is being way too over dramatic, and you should do what you think is truely right. Your mother has turned her family away from your sister, thats not right at all. Real family sticks together, if you care for your sister, you'll stick by her and make her the head of the table. Who cares if she had some kids, its done and other with, and those kids are a part of everyone's lives now and no one should still be so angry about it. If your mother loved your sister, or you...she wouldn't be doing this to you two! how very selfish. I'm young myself, but she's really...a momzilla...I can see that. What would you rather want, the support of a family that obviously tossed your sister aside, or your sister...who would except you no matter what? I'm sorry if my opinion is cruel...but I feel that your stuck in a tough situation...and I'm giving you some good advice hopefully. Stick to the people that love you most, want the best for you, and who needs you the most. Your sister deserves the head of the table, and your mother needs to except that the past is over with and what she's doing isn't right. I hope you choose well, its the future for you.|`|8ygky5g4aa	There will be plenty of family and friends at the wedding that will be thrilled to see your sisters children.  I'm sure she won't have to worry about them at all.    I would suggest to just yes your mom, and then do what you want.  It is your wedding and the maid of honor should sit at the head table if that is what you want!    If you or your sister is nervous about the children, hire a babysitter or appoint a family member or friend to help with the kids at the reception.     I feel bad for your sister having to put up with such awful treatment from her own mother.  If you feel your mother is in the wrong, then stick up for your sister and support her.  If your sister is in the wrong, then vice versa.  The only thing you can do is try to be honest and support your family.    I'm sure with all the people at your wedding and everything going on your mom won't have a chance to ruin anything.  Hang in there!
XzLUA7ataa	As a mother, I could notice when my daughters (3 of them) became sexually active.  There were some telltale signs:  he stops by with a rose now and then, she starts wearing prettier undies, at the perfume counter she's looking for something to encourage passion,  the movie or sports event or dance they're going to that evening is less important,  they want more quiet time together.  He's got that little sparkle in his eyes when he looks her over.  The phone calls are more frequent. They are more of a couple now and when they socialize they interact with other couples rather than singles.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Yes...  don't ask me how - they just know!

His choice.  His life.  If he really loves you, he will work for your reasonable wishes.    DON'T get a shared account! BIG mistake!  Don't give him money unless you know he WILL pay you back!  Free money is only for presents!  He shouldn't be your child.    Do you own a bus??  (If you mean business, you would say it or use "bus.").    Leave him if he doesn't care about you two living together, or the kids future!    You got to be "cruel" to be "kind" in this situation!    These are the type of people that should get restraining orders-usually people who spend/waste that much money on trash would come back to you and assult you if you kicked him out/let him! (It's his fault as long as you didn't start anything/physical fight with him!)|`|39ffbfd0a34a9f7af7b917b67430f11baa	Get professional help. You wont get too much good advice here. Some will say "dump the bastard". Others will say "just talk with him".     He is lying because his pride has been ruined. He is out of control and feels like he will be able to fix it. It is addictive behavior and you can not take it on yourself. It is possible to get through this but you will need outside help. If you cant afford it then try a decent church. They often have free counseling and help for problems like this.|`|AA11745675	Wow sorry to hear that. You first need to find out the real reason. is the money going away every month cause he has another woman he's spending it on. as you said he said he's not sure if he loves you anymore . or could it be just drugs and booze. thats alot of money dissappearing fast. does he have a gambling problem all these things you don't know without sitting down and have him open up. You can do this if he loves you . you can work on it . like they say better or for worse well this is a little of the worse right now. but your his wife and you can stand behind him and bring him back up if he's feeling no self worth. but before you can help him you need to find the root cause or your just speculating.    Try speaking to him have a real heart to heart. find out whats bugging him. its your life too. and you want to be happy and live your life with him so its in your best interest to find out why he's hurting so much. ;plus you have many years together and you love him    Could be he's lost his job any man feels like a failure when there use to supporting a family. Let him no right off the bat he is not a failure he's still the man you and the kids love. and another job will come along but in the mean time he'll feel like crap thats part of his makeup working and providing for wife and children so expect that.     Could also be after the loss of the job he's re-evaluating his life and thinks it stinks right now. 23 years of marrige too could be stuck in a rutt. things dont' change you both do the same thing day after day. I'm sure even you would like things to change. See if thats bothering him. sometimes spicing things up getting back to basics going for a weekly date even if its just to the movies get a baby sitter. things can get dull after so many years for both of you important to recapture the romance and excitement and i know it can be hard with kids you get lost in them and forget about hubby. but really try making an effort in finding out whats got him in the dumps. its not to late as long as your still both willing to try. and the good news here is he was willing to open up to you to tell you he's not happy and things are bothering him. worse would be for him to clam up and keep saying nothing then you wake up one day and he's gone.    So keep communicating with him. and let him know your his rock his right hand man and your there for each other.    Hope things go well.   best of luck.|`|b7f17f6053d56c85885cbb30d7ba8a07aa	Open your own account and don't give him access to it. You need to take control-especially since you have children to raise!

"for better or worst, well not worst. i'm just not sure about worst. if it gets worst i might want to bail. but better is good. i'll stick around for better." look i know the drugs is scaring you, and yea you and your kids need to be safe. so "leaving" to a safe place is something you might want to do, but i wouldnt leave the marraige. you're a family and you obviously love him. he needs help, he's drowning, and it's sad he couldnt turn to you. but he's seeing a counselor, let him. you might want to go with him. he needs to get over all those feelings of failure, guilt, loss and whatever else comes with losing a business. and you need to be his rock. marraige is NOT 50/50. it's 100/100. you give 100 % of yourself all the time and he should too. so that when one of you can't give your % then atleast you can survive on the other's 100%. so give it all girl, and stand by your man. it's hard i know! but you can do it. and if he just doesnt want you then let him let you guys go. in the meantime do all you can to salvage your FAMILY. good luck, and GOD BLESS,lissette|`|da1e295215dbe3e0c4db934a35a74973aa	Professional help is required here for the both of you,23yrs married is not to be sneezed at.You have both come so far-so with "proper" help and advice about the whole problem(taking in the relationship-and business/financial aspects of it all)you should try for the next 23yrs,you will make it I'm sure:-)And joy.....unless you know what you are talking about,butt out-negative responses like yours do not help in any way.|`|ea0c17aa4c0c17813c6aa5a92c94b64daa	Very difficult times in your marriage.

One is St. John wort or something like that. Also as simple as this sounds, think happy thoughts, listen to happy music and quit dwelling on how sad you feel. Try to make someone else happy. Perhaps bake some cookies for a neighbor. Then when they smile you will too. It becomes contagious. But the first time you have to make yourself do something positive. The first time is the hardest because you do feel so sad. I do understand how you feel, but just try to do something other than think about your sadness. Good luck to you!

I don't know anyone who's with somebody who doesn't want the things I listed.  And if the people fail to live up to the expectations, then the partners/spouses want child support/spousal support.... there are no safe relationships because people aren't perfect.... so if you are up to the challenge get married and do the very best you can.... and learn how to forgive someone because sooner or later one or both of you will mess up ... usually more than once.

He needs a good lawyer though.|`|ceddd1bac3cbfaa04f027bb037d2bfb2aa	NO, it's not hard for a man to win.  All he has to do is file first and make more money than her.  I've seen it done.    Justice may be blind but it can smell money.|`|AA10829043	the only way is if you can make her unfit. or if its not a good enviroment for them. good luck|`|15ed931be7792e113d1355ee59e11748aa	I don't really know but the dad would have to find a way to make the mother looked bad as a parent so the kids you go to him.|`|0f10ea72a617748c92595868705445a4aa	yes,    Tell the wife it is over and record the conversation on a mini recorder.  Be cold and direct.  She will fly off the handle and most certainly threaten to do bodily harm to him.  this is an expected emotion but certainly does not fly well when custody is considered.    A neighbor of mine did this successfully...  He regretted it after because it was the wrong thing to do in his situation.  The kids are back with the mother as he regretted how he handled it as it affected his children (playing tug of war with the child).  But it worked for the courts.|`|b5ee9f828fb42a23bef3b96b59f63107aa	She is not crazy, he's the loon that keeps loaded guns in his house with no gun locks on them, smokes pot, can't hold a steady job, etc. etc. And we've (she and I) allowed him visitation, but there is no way the judge is going to give him full custody until he cleans up his act. And even then, he has a bad temper, so we would not allow it. She is not crazy, you're just hearing one side of it. And frankly, its just not your business at all - why don't you go back to trying to tell your husband you're pregnant with "his" baby even though he has a vasectomy - you little whore.|`|22fc9b3de019ab0e54602c6f486056d2aa	Get a lawyer that specializes in family and custody cases.

A father can take his children away from a mom ,but he has to show several signs that she is unfit and not capable of taking care of them. My sister in law is in years of fighting her husband for her kids and he has a lot of money and that's why I believe that the battle has gone on so long. It really depends on the situation of the couple. They will bring all sorts of stuff into this couples life like CPS and background checks they dig deep up everything when it comes to custody of children. Call a lawyer in the state he is in and tell them the situation and they can help you for what can be done. Good Luck......|`|bca23255ffd120a5555209a9e8b2c99baa	Unless she is declared to be mentally unfit to take care of children.

It is very possible for him to get fulll custody. He needs to document everything he can with official papers. For instance if the cops are called to the house cuz she is sleeping and the kids are wandering outside, then get the paperwork on that. A judge needs offical proof that she is not a fit mother.

1552ff230ba1c3b8792ae752a532f846aa	First of all, you should NEVER SLAP A WOMAN ! Walk away if you have too but you have no right too ever slap a woman. But too answer your question...A woman's body goes through a lot of changes  and our hormones go into overload .your girlfriend was probably having PMS ! You owe her an apology even if she is no longer seeing you, which would be the smart thing for her. I'm sorry if i sound harsh but I think that if a man slaps a woman then he may become abusive later on. Remember you have no right too ever do that!|`|fe7c291caca55c25fe63e4ddbd5dd51eaa	Because we're in pain like you can't imagine, we're fat, we're bleeding, and we want chocolate.

AA11107150	Of course you can a good relationship and still incorporate all the things you both love. No, it will not be easy but if you really love her then it will work. The first thing you must have a "true" parameters therefore, the commitment line will not be broken and you two as a couple will always be successful. Ask yourself why each time it ended up hurting the couple more. Once you realize that then don't repeat the same mistake twice. It may also come down to a trial and error type situation to begin with. The bond lies between you and her anyone else shall remain on the outside. Always remember that and the successful method rests right before your eyes. Always sit back and listen to what other people have to say and they will let you know where they are coming from, don't rush into an sexual relationship with anyone and if you don't then you will be hungry for what is anticipated.|`|802ce6675f85f11da775e5f2c71d9a49aa	honestly i have tried that one having a gf and bf at the same time and then my gf having a bf too it just made things all to complicated cause then u got to try and spend equal time with one or the other and then one of them is complaining about the other it is just way to complicated to even try and be with two people at once.|`|AA11311749	research polyamory    In any relationship communication is key.  Introducing a third person in a relationship, having discussed it honestly before and, if necessary, after, will complicate things, but not unbearably so, as long as everybody is honest and committed.  If the relationship was off to begin and communication was not great, then it ill spell disaster.  Remember it is not for everyone.  And even for those that can handle it, it takes a lot of honesty with others and especially themselves.    Negotiate up front being honest and KEEP TALKING about it, and stay honest, when you start hiding you start loosing.|`|a3eb0e8dd85a19141250e3da9058a85aaa	My primary partner (pp) and I are both lesbian, and we have a poly family with 3 girls - one straight, one bi and one lesbian. We are into BDSM - my pp is the dominant of two and I am the dominant of one. In addition, my pp is submissive to me. Additionally, my pp and I have a "girlfriend" (i.e. friend with benefits) who is a "friend of the family".     It is a LOT of work. We have to make sure everyone gets equal attention, but that all of our individual and collective needs are met as well as possible. We are lifestyle bdsm - we have one "vanilla" night a week to play poker and go to a bar with our vanilla friends. I can tell you right now that we spend a heck of a lot more time taking care of our relationships than we do having sex. Let's see, on average my pp and I have sex about twice a week, we see our gf about once a week, and we try to see our girls once a week - although that only incidentally involves actual sex.  All of our girls are allowed to have outside sexual relationships with the person(s) of their choice.    I realize that having a man involved would change the dynamics of our poly family - that by having only women it has a different flavor than it would with one or several men, or if we were all men. Basically, this is our Family Of Choice - and we also know that it will not last. These kinds of relationships are organic, and they sometimes work - until they don't any more.     My pp and I were completely up front and honest at the beginning of our relationship - and I mean _completely_; painfully and embarrassingly so. We decided we're too old for the crap of bothering to date someone we will end up not liking or trying to change or who will try to change us. I would say that is the difference. We're no longer willing to waste time on relationships that are _almost_ what we want.  (We're both in our 40s.)    I would say that your best bets _are_ the BDSM community, or the swingers community (where else are you going to find people who, in general, are willing to accept all kinds of relationships?); choose a family friend, or maybe a couple that you are friends with; or choose someone who neither you or your partner knows well. Oh, also, I can tell you that just because we agreed to have sex with our gf, we only do it together, and that includes no emotional cheating. (She can't borrow my sweetie to snuggle her on the couch while I'm at the grocery store. But she can borrow my sweetie to cut her grass - as long as ours gets cut first!)    Really, think seriously about the time and relationship commitment this is going to be. Perhaps it's one of those things best left in the realm of fantasy.    Good luck!

Xhy6VEzOaa	yeha i wonder that too..  remember why you married him  try doing new, different things with him other than sex  when you do have sex..add a little to it..  role playing..candles..be creative..  and rekindle that flame!  im sure there are lots of websites to help too w/ this kind of stuff|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Well if your not into new things, why ask this question. Not into fore play, why even have sex. Foreplay is when most women enjoy sex the most. Your taking half the fun out of your sex life. I would say, try role playing,toys, dressing up or down. depending on what games you like to play.Buy sex games from Spencer's in the mall. They have some fun games. Good luck
XzLUA7ataa	Prepare him a nice dinner at home and bake his favorite cookies.  Write him a poem or make a card.  Light a few candles and put on some soft music.  Put a single rose into a vase in the bathroom he uses or on his dresser.|`|5bea5b92613f998503999650d76207e1aa	Hi sparkers   This is something that works a nice bubble bath  light up those candles and soft music and just make him something by hand like a heart and use glitter for the words like your my solemate I will always love you and don't for get that special nittie
MhpccWpmaa	some of them.  there are some that I don't because I know in the past that they've slept with their friends boyfriends or just because they're relatively promiscuous.  I tend to go with my gut feeling on things, the same goes with people.  The ones I don't really trust aren't my close friends|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	Yes.      But I also believe in not being stupid.  My SO (aka spouse) and I have an agreement not to be alone with someone of the opposite sex because sometimes stupid things happen when one allows temptation to be too close....|`|0WstfAmzaa	What do you mean?  As in my girl friends with my husband?    Sure, I trust them, except for that one who left her husband last year and ran off with my other friend's husband.  But, we're no longer friends...|`|MTLbbGWxaa	Some i do, other's i don't. its mostly because I know they could take advantage of the situation at any given time. Basically, I kept my guy on check lol.  go with your gut intution on ppl. If you feel like you don't like them being around ur significant other for a reason, go with that. You're first instants are usually right.|`|tw2sAsBuaa	First, let me start by stating this "why would you involve yourself with someone you cant trust"? Of course I can leave my friends around my man. I am picky, so I pick my friends, like I pick my man! I will not let someone in my life who is untrustworthy. Now, don't get me wrong sometimes you may meet someone that seems okay, and then they change. When that friend changes their views on life and what it means to be a great, I cut them loose. If you are a trustworthy person you should surround yourself with people that are trustworthy, or you are asking for someone to betray you!|`|Kc6H5ZLZaa	Yes,If you know each other...and you trust each other...|`|L8J5nNjDaa	yes
veZLfnGFaa	Keep working hard and prove to the whole family what you can do.  You have been through a lot for someone your age and should be very proud of yourself for what you have accomplished. (I know you care about your best friend, but, as you know, no one is going to get help until they are ready.)  Keep on doing whatever you are doing - hold your head up - you are doing great. ;)|`|o1yy6KABaa	Just keep holding your head high and working towards your dream, when you get there they will realise how much time they have wasted by holiding your past against you.  Remember as well that when it comes to drug or alcohol abuse, its not only the victim whos life it affects, its theirs too so maybe they just havent dealt with that part of your life properly just yet, it will take time. keep standing tall and be proud of how far you have come x0x|`|pSy88C9paa	prince said it like this:  "love yourself until everyone else does too"  you can't get caught up in pleasing other people.  No matter who, you can only follow your own heart and  give yourself that respect.  And sometimes it is not about you at all, but about the insecurities  of other people who are not comfortable with who they are themselves  or who do not have the courage to be themselves.  Congrats to you in all of your accomplishments  I wish you the best|`|44QPXU5eaa	I am the black sheep out of my big family. I am with a guy that my WHOLE family dislike. You just have to stop worrying about what they think because it is their issue not yours. You can not change what another person thinks about you so dont even try to. I did alot of stupid stuff while growing up and continued to but how i see it, it is my life. I only have one life to live and I have to do what I want. If they love you they will be there for you, if they cut you out then they were not worth your time and effort.    You sound like you have your life on track now so just continue doing what makes you happy|`|dVlLahozaa	keep working hard and don't mind others
AA12321197	Um, well judging from your side of the story it does seem as if she is brushing you off a little bit. Perhaps you are reading too much into the situation. It is very rude of your friend to talk to her other friends on the phone for a long time when she is in the company of  you. I'm assuming you have talked quite a bit about this with her? It sounds as if she is annoyed. You two can still be friends, but it never hurts to find more friends to hang out with. Maybe if you and your friend spend some time apart and hang out with different people you will both want to hang out more- or you both may just go your seperate ways. Good luck with finding some new friends and if you can get over how she ignores you than try to keep your friendship going.|`|AA12089968	A FRIEND ACCEPTS ANOTHER FRIEND JUST THE WAY THEY ARE WITH ALL THE GOOD AND BAD ATTRIBUTES.

It's all about respect. And when she says "yeah, they're my friends" the message she's sending is like "yeah, i got other friends, other than you." And that is what is eating you coz she made you feel less important. Be friends with her but find other friends as well coz that's how she sees you, one of her friends.

Men are more analytical  about most everything and we women are more emotional. "I tend to go with my gut and not reason everything out.  Men  can be dogs and women can be cats!   Men get lost in sporting goods and they just stopped for one beer and time got away! yeah we both bend the truth  and lose track of time!

Otherwise, all we can do is answer with stereotypes and tired old clichs about how women are "emotional" thinkers and men are "analytical" thinkers and other such nonsense. It's difficult to explain a behavior attributed to an entire population based purely on gender without specifics.    Now, if you asked me to explain how and why the communicative styles of men and women differ, I could give you a more scientific answer. But how they see "truth" and "time" differently? I'm not sure I agree that they do.|`|e93aa79e95ca9095ee68dbce9bf16eedaa	Because God made them different !!!!!!!!!!  So they see things differently --- from diff angles and diff. viewpoints.

If so, perhaps that's not helping.  I understand that you feel if you do good for someone you expect them to return the favor however you are not getting that?  So perhaps it's the kind of friends you keep?  A true friend would certainly try to help you even if you couldn't do the exact same back.  So the old adage, "Do unto others as they do to you" can really be symbolic for you...don't you think?   I like to believe no good deed goes unturned.  And  Good things come to all who wait.  So hang in there...if your heart is in the right place that you simply just help a friend in need...karma will be twofold.

Our society is the rudest it has been (as said in Reader's Digest) and it is more likely that you won't receive the favor than anything.    But you could try not being so nice and lending money anymore, or you could still lend them the money and just be happy with the fact that you did a good favor for someone.|`|AA10898432	STOP doing that!...then see who your friends really are........people don't need your money...they need to grow up and get their own....and realize that most people are not as kind as you..before you lose everything including your self-respect..|`|08fece182a9caf87f1ad9254979ada8eaa	Sounds like they really aren't your friends.

Si eres viejo, pasa exactamente lo mismo: si haces algo que para tu edad ya no es correcto, inmediatamente te llaman la atencion, te limitan, no te dan tu lugar y lo peor es que son los hijos los que lo hacen...........

Pero suerte y cuidate.|`|01686ef54d7d22d6267d7be117232d9eaa	Yo creo que ambas etapas son dificiles, porque de jovenes, pues es la etapa de la rebeldia, y de viejos, es como si volvierana  ser ni?os, pero no es que las personas no te comprendan, tal vez eres tu el que no esta dando a conocer que es lo que quiere, o no esta expresando lo que siente.  A veces es necesario acercarse mucho a la familia y mas cuando eres adolescente, acercate a tus papas, ellos mejor que nadie te pueden ayudar, pero si no les pides ayudas, no son adivinos, acuerdate del dicho, "Al que habla dios lo escucha", si no dices lo que quieres, dificilmente los demas te entenderan.  Los viejitos, a veces son como ni?os, necios, tercos, pero hay que respetarlos, porque son personas mayores y la verdad merecen que les demos cari?o, que los cuidemos, que los entendamos, algun dia aunque no nos guste, todos estaremos viejos y el envejecer noi debe ser simbolo de verguenza, al contrario, hay que saber envejecer con dignidad, creo que tanto jovenes como viejitos, deben expresar lo que quieren, sienten, para poder que las personas los entiendan, saludos.|`|e6893960635aafafd62d531f83a1beceaa	Cada etapa de la vida tiene sus complicaciones

Es una cuestion, como dijo alguien de los que respondieron, de resentimiento, por lo que los padres hicieron o dejaron de hacer, cuando uno es peque?o, desafortunadamente, nadie ense?a al ser humano a ser padre, y se cometen muchos errores, algunos mas grandes que otros y eso en definitiva es lo que hace que los hijos, odien a sus padres.  No se puede evitar, mas bien se tiene que superar, hay muchas cosas que ayudan, como: terapias familiares, retiros espirituales, etc. pero en definitiva nadie puede hacer que el odio desaparezaca como por arte de magia.  Asi como paso el tiempo y las heridas se fueron habriendo, asi el tiempo las sanara.  Tambien es recomendable poner tierra de por medio, el alejamiento, hace que los recuerdos se vayan borrando un poco, no existe el olvido, solo se puede recordar sin dolor.|`|fdec7388e3fb5c3358ad88e03c4fa5ebaa	acabo de entrar a ver preguntas y responder y a su vez buscar alguna respuesta que pueda calmarme... por ensima vez estoy llorando... quers saber por qu? porque una vez ms mi padre me hace sentir una basura, una vez ms me tengo que hacer cargo de una desicion que El toma y cuando estoy arreglando las cosas, toma el mando el y me deja pagando como una inutil... desgraciadamente se puede odiar a un padre, el hecho de que sea padre no lo califica ni lo protege de comportamientos egoistas y contradictorios dignos de un psicpata como es mi viejo. No se puede creer pero es as... yo, adems trabajo con mi viejo y lo tengo de jefe... igual de tirano, igual de injusto, ciego, arbitrario y despota como puede ser cualquier otro jefe. Peor, porque sabe como manipularte desde los sentimientos y darte golpes bajos, muy bajos te lo puedo asegurar... Si tu amiga odia a su padre escuchala y creele porque puede ser verdad...

AA10376417	Well, it could be an age issue.. for the reason he may be trying to control you, I'm 21 and my daughters dad is 38 and we had that problem.. or it could be that he is guilty of cheating, and might take it out on you (guilty conscious) or it could be that he thinks you are pretty and you could have any guy you want, so therefore he is insecure, about being with you.. this is just my view point.. i hope nothing that i said was rude, but just a different way to look at things..

Either he is really insecure with himself and has been burned badly a few times or he is being unfaithful himself which seems to cause a person to worry that the other person is doing the same and must be watched closely. You'll know which one is true if you really think about it because I'm sure you know him well. My ex-girlfriend was that way to an extent and it was just because she had some insecurity within herself.|`|3bc6a9227f3e59130097c29c097c11d1aa	you are suffering from depression or all of the pressure from becoming a mom is all seeming o be wrng but right at the same time and amybe he is not supporting you like the way you have imagind he would.

If they do, and both know that it's about the "separation," what's the problem? The girlfriend shouldn't be looking for the man to marry her, and the wife shouldn't think that the girlfriend necessarily poses the most basic threat to the marriage -- there are probably other issues to work out.    I say let the situation be. Maybe the wife should go get herself a boyfriend.

Yo no me di cuenta de que ella quera algo ms porque pensaba que quera solo amistad. Hasta que se enojo y empez a cortar la relacin de amistad. Eso hizo que yo la buscara ms, hasta el punto de desesperarme por estar con ella. Y entonces me di cuenta que la amaba y se lo dije. Despus me cont que se haba alejado de m porque me quera.

ygGr1nX7aa	'supposed to happen'... According to who?    Some people might see it as 'gay', but that's kind of missing the point, since the girl is still a girl, not a guy... besides which, there's nothing wrong with being gay.      There's no universal law that says that one person in a relationship must behave in a 'masculine' fashion, and the other in a 'feminine' one.  At the end of the day those are just socially defined roles that don't work for everyone and don't have to.  It's really no-one's business but theirs, and if they're okay with it that should be enough for anyone.

Because you let them. You sound like you would bend over for most of them if you thought they would hang around.     You have to understand that women do not go for men they can lead around by the nose. They may like you at first but it won't be long and they figure you out.     Ask yourself why do you have to please them? Where did you get the idea that doing things for them and following them around like a little puppy would make them like you.    Remember this: Women do not like men who act like one of their girlfriends. They have enough of them. What they want is a man who will treat them like a women, be confident and not let them get away with anything. Hard to believe but they actually like you to tease them, make fun of them, and generally make them laugh, even at themselves. You do that right and they will be all over you.    Be unpredictable, funny, treat them like they are your bratty kid sister and never let them lead you anywhere.    You do that and your problems will go away.    Go join this guys e-mail.

Either way, you should maybe just flirt with them a little, not just let them know you like them, so that they are NOT given that chance to "pretend" they like you. Slow down, take it easy, don't be too clingy (one guy was too clingy and I had trouble with being around him for a while after). Maybe they just have no boyfriend and resort to relying on you, who seems to give them the butterfly-in-the-stomach feeling, but it may just be temporary. But don't worry about it; not all girls are like that. Just take a step back, and don't reveal your feelings that quickly! :-)|`|b54b92994ee8215a58c6be74a01739a4aa	If they start acting like they like you, or say they do or whatever, be blunt with them.

Personally, this is my feeling, that marriage was created by God to be between a Man and a Woman, not a woman and a woman or man and a man.  God hates homosexuality.  He does NOT hate the homosexual.  He hates the sin, not the sinner.      I personally feel that if you wanting to marry another woman, you need to leave that horrible lifestyle, get your life right with God, and find a man that God has for you, and marry him.
AA11107150	A threesome is not for everyone. It takes a special kind of person to be able to see their mate with someone else and not get offended. Once you have found these three individuals then you have only conquered half the battle. My suggestion (if 2 girls and a guy) always let the female have the most influence on who the third person is. The two women must mutually bond and the male will fall in place. Once that has been established then don't just jump directly into sex but rather the three of you interacting. If done properly a bond will be formed and not just a sex thing and that is where the healthy threesome is derived. All rules need to be established from day one so you need to already know your position. Stick to the plan and remember equality.|`|8d247a79f221523d3dbd05779b08f395aa	buy two puppys|`|7fdde3a254456d3a8a27667afe4f0d4faa	dont do it it is not as much fun as you would think|`|7a683bcaf6a2d04f51d158b34d54576caa	first time my wife and another girl,second time my wife and another guy  and me.        .

47f3688e5000176812f451f910b01d72aa	Just laugh it off. These are ur friends and as friends its healthy to laugh at eack other. when they make a joke about it tomorow just laugh along. If u continue to be the but of jokes all the time perhaps there is a problem. But to me it sounds like good banter, that all people have at school, hell those me and my mates ripped it out of each other. No one will think any less of you, it was a mistake anyone could have made, and if you handle it well (ie by laughing it off) you will seem cool, for being able to laugh at urself.|`|AA12005574	get on them be like i dont see you lookin as good as me|`|e6c5f5c81068ce7eb0ae5e138ad4eea8aa	Sounds to me like you need new friends. Friends dont make someone feel bad. They are suppose to make you feel good about yourself. Dont let them get to you. It was just one day of a bad make up day. We all have them. Just like a bad hairday. There is always tomorrow when things look better. God bless you and good luck.|`|458ec1035bb706b59e65a4d2e6ba75fcaa	Get new friends they are immature and are not true to you|`|7aa5e1ef0cc0ac8344a32c6cb8f98d45aa	Laugh it off everybody does stupid things in their lifetime.So don't worry about it, even though one of your friends should have said something.|`|aac3b4fabef4c3e2736d7ff09449870aaa	I don't believe that they r your true friends if they like 2 watch u look stupid.the next time they do something stupid,don't tell them about it.|`|ac20a16ae243dcfed0e7ee4278a2ffb5aa	I wouldnt worry about it.

What happens is happens. Yes, you looked a bit funny FOR THEM but it doesn't mean that you should even care about their opinion. These things happen, and this one is not the worst you could've got in. If they start talking about it, just make a joke like "Did you like it? I can wear it like that every day?" or something or just ignore them.    In scgool most people are a bit immature so they will laugh at so little issues like that. Just forget about it and move on, its no big issues.    Friends always make fun of each other, its the part of friendship in a way. Forget about that situation and next time dom make-up better ;)    Good luck and don't let so small things to get to you.  Wolfy.|`|f11cc7c918ba6463113a7c91f6ea9c50aa	I seriously think you need better friends! if that happened to me i would be really mad if my friends didn't tell me Just try to forget it because most people forget easily!  but if you keep on thinking about it then it will bother you ! and about your friends you should talk to them but if they keep treating you bad then i think u should start hanging out with different people !  good luck !|`|4ad5d9c0987df04733e39109a8ea90b3aa	you need to set those people strait!!!!!!!!!!!! you need to get better friends!!!!!!!!!! if you need more help email me.

Appena la situazione sar favorevole sono certa che far anche il grande passo. E' pazzo di loro e farebbe qualsiasi cosa, come se fossero bimbe sue...se li vedessi insieme, capiresti.

Prova con Meetic, mi sembra abbastanza sano come sistema.  Ma soprattutto quando conoscerai qualcuno, quando ti presenterai, dillo subito che hai un figlio e di quanti mesi ...... non fare in modo che salti fuori per caso.  Perche' se uno ti ha gia' puntata e gli dici subito che hai un figlio fa gia' un certo pensiero........ se glielo dici dopo, il bambino diventa il rompiballe.  Auguri.|`|c4f6ea51c611e4f2579483a73bba738eaa	Se il mondo  quello che, tra le righe, descrivi tu, siamo messi molto peggio di quanto credessi. L'alternativa  che tu parli cos a mo' di scongiuro, comprensibile.  Io ovviamente parto da me stesso, non posso essere certo di come la pensino altri, ma ti assicuro che non vedo quali potrebbero essere le tue difficolt nel trovare un compagno, che voglia bene ad entrambe.  Oppure non hai scritto qualche particolare essenziale: dove vivi tu  vietato sposare ultratrentenni neo madri? O credi che il maschio di turno, pur potendosi innamorare di te, sbraner il piccolo per non dover perder tempo nell'educare progenie non sua? Molti animali lo fanno, dalle tue parti vivono solo animali maschi?   Mi capita talvolta, e questo  il caso, di non poter credere ai miei occhi leggendo una domanda.   Ma io non sono te, e questo  anche vero.  Per questo forse certe domande delicate andrebbero completate con maggiori particolari.  Io ho vissuto 40 anni in Lombardia e 5 anni in Sicilia, ovunque troveresti numerosi pretendenti, sempre che tu cercassi amore e non chissach.  Sei nel pieno della maturit, hai la fortuna di avere una piccola che qualunque uomo adulto e degno di questo nome sarebbe ben felice di poter allevare ed educare dandole tutto l'affetto di questo mondo.  Io in Sicilia ci sono venuto, dopo un divorzio, per raggiungere la mia nuova compagna 34enne, figlia 13enne compresa, e non ho trovato il bench minimo problema in questo senso.  So che in giro ci sono tanti scemosauri poco evoluti, ma ti assicuro, non tutti sono cos.  Sii invece felice per tua figlia, e preparati a tanta felicit ancora quando troverai l'uomo che ti sta cercando, che  la fuori, e che se ti sentisse si offenderebbe pure per quel che dici.  St su bella, e perdona il caratteraccio di questo quattrocchi che ama tanto l'amore e che vorrebbe un sacco di bambini intorno.....  Auguroni di cuore.|`|1b9e575884f1251290be70b131633632aa	Certo, non demordere!

593cc7162be795df8f21e8c347d8ca55aa	The birds and the bees" (sometimes expanded to "the birds, the bees and the butterflies" or "the birds, the bees, the flowers, and the trees") is a commonly used phrase (which has become somewhat of a clich) which refers to clumsy or inept attempts at sex education for children or adolescents, such as the use of euphemisms or symbols to describe sexual behaviour or body parts. A discussion about "the birds and the bees" may therefore involve references to nature (ie. animals and plants) without actually describing human biology or providing any useful insight.    The phrase is said to have its origins in a folk tale, whose exact source is unknown, that reportedly became popular in Southern Africa (probably Namibia) around the turn of the last century. It tells the story of a colony of bee-eater (Merops pusillus) birds laying their eggs after a meal of honeybees.    Or possibly derived from Kamadeva, Hindu god of love that is accompanied by a selection of Birds and Bees at all times.    The phrase was also part of a hit song in the early 1960s.|`|18785573810584899b295a327a9ededfaa	does it really matter???..............well i think it is cuz they had to make up some secret code name for sex so little kids dont know what the adults are talking about. why dont you ask bush hes got an excuse for every thing.|`|AA11020911	Cause guys have "stingers".

Just think... In our grand parents younger years of marriage, they had the same problems we have, with worst circumstances of prejudices and so forth.  If they gave up as easily as people do today, we wouldn't have 50, 60 or even 70 year anniversaries today.  I am getting married next Wednesday (Nov. 1st '06)... We've been through tough times, but why start all over with someone new when no relationship is perfect.  Everyone thinks the grass is greener on the other side, when they just need to water their own grass.  Just remember those words and hang in there... Never think about throwing in the towel just to start anew with someone else & go through the same exact thing.  It's sad when I see people married 3 or 4 times to different people.  That means they wasted time with all of those people, when they could have worked things out with the 1st one.  Sometimes I wonder about people these days...

265599eb6b09216771b00ec5b3f92bfeaa	I have a similar relationship.  I really think it is that men are a different breed!  They do not need the day to day chit chat or the constant reassurance that we need.  I think you did the right thing by telling him the five things you need.  Now it is up to him.  If he makes an effort, then you can be confident that he has feelings for you.  If he makes no effort, then I would think that he isn't overly motivated to make you happy.  I have seen a counselor over the exact same issue.  His best advice to me has been to always tell my boyfriend my feelings, without attacking him and telling him what he is doing wrong or what he needs to do.  I should give him the chance to show me the real him by letting him decide how he wants to handle my feelings.  Once he knows what I want and need, he can decide to do nothing or change.  Then I can decide if he is worth staying around for.      In my situation, I do feel loved and valued when we are together and it continues to bother me when I do not hear from him for a few days (even when he is in town).  However, I know he really does need more space than me and that he cares about me, so I weigh the pros and cons of our relationship and decide he is worth it.  I am also older, so have had a lot of experience and know that with time, I will appreciate some space as well.  I also know that good guys are hard to come by, so I need to accept his faults and love him for who he is.      Good luck to you.|`|AA12089968	MAYBE IF YOU ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE TO PICK HIM UP AT THE AIRPORT OR FOR ANYTHING HE WILL GET THE POINT.

AA12273500	Explain nothing to your son until you have sought advice from your attorney.  He is too little to understand what's going on and doesn't need to be but in the middle  Kids usually cope better in these situation then the adults do  Your ex has never paid child support and would have to prove he his able to care for a child he doesn't even know let him spend the money with a lawyer to find out. Maybe when he knows he is responsible for all the back payments he might decide not to see the child|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Th fact that you don't want the biological father should be around doesn't mean it should be. Your son has a right to know his true father. And if he wants to he could take you to court and get some sort of custody. I understand the new daddy is a huge part of his life and that is awesome but your son still deserves the chance to get to know his real father. Try to put yourself in his position. If you left your sons life for whatever reason and realized it wasn't the right choice and wanted to come back and make up for it all and try to have some sort of relationship and the father said no! No fair is it?|`|AA11110297	tell the child's father (biological) that if he wants to be a father to his son, then he has to earn your trust first....  that should include paying child support in a timely fashion, taking parenting class since he hasn't been around small children and probably doesn't know how to communicate on their level. And while he's doing that you tell your son about his father(biological one). Get an attorney, Then go back to court and get things hammered out on paper --- visitations, child support payments etc.... express your concerns with the judge, insist that the father take a parenting course.   (You may not want him in the child's life but if the biological father takes you to court he'll probably be able to have visits with his son.)|`|e3125855c619a06cb58c5a81b955366caa	Keep this man from your son, if possible.  Nothing is harder on a child than someone who comes into their lives then leaves.  Each time the child  feels like they did something wrong to make the dad not come back or make them not love him.  He has a steady father-figure in his life.  Why add someone who will only cause your son pain?  If he tries to see him tell him you make him pay fair child support.  That usually scares the losers away.|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	It's not a decision you can make. It IS a decision that your social worker can make. Or your attorney. Depending on how much $ you make. I will tell you that he will be allowed back into the child's life, and to tell you the truth, he should be, just as soon as he gets caught up on his support payments. Just as soon as he signs the agreement that your attorney has written up as to his visitation schedule and responsibilities. Believe me as soon as he sees what this will cost him in $, and responsibility, he will bolt! If you are sent to the social worker, do not say he should be exorcised from the child's life, that puts him in the drivers seat! You should start explaining the situation to your child now, a bit at a time. Don't poison his mind against his father as that will come out and backfire if this goes to court! Good luck.|`|AA10503123	one has nothing to do with the other. child support and visitation are two seperate things. you cannot deny visitation because the child'd father has not paid child support.  if he is the childs biological father the courts will allow him visitation.  your child has the right to know his biological father.  if the courts impose that you allow visitation and he continually is absent, you can petition the court to terminate his parental rights, of coarse the biological father will have to appear to agree or appeal. good luck, it seems like you want the best for your child, whenever he is dissapointed by his biological father just tell him that you know how he feels to be dissapointed and that his daddy loves him very much but that he is trying to do the best he can. even if at this moment it is not true, your son will respect you more(when he's older) than lying to him now and him resenting you later. best wishes to you.|`|eb925f2f95a4a4557378e1eab4672726aa	I went through this too. You need to look at it legally, first. You need legal advice, not emotional advice.|`|0352c1286e700033dfbf06ed42ccbafeaa	Well, the children have a right to know who their biological father is and alot of people talk about the rights of the biological parents and my concern would be for the children, not the parents. as for the biological father, you should give him rules before he sees his son, like supporting his son by child support, birthdays, christmas, phone calls and if he does those for awhile and show you he can be trustworthy and supportive, then maybe he can see his son, but, he screw up once he shouldn't be aloud in the child's life until he is old enough to decide if he wants his father in his life and then he can find out for his self what kind of person his father is.  That way, your son won't be mad at you, if you tell him what kind of person his biological father is, chances are he won't believe you and he would blame you from keeping him from his father and bad mouthing about his father.

9805044c74ba44ee2f745960f84490aaaa	When a girl says 'its that time of the month' it does not mean she is 'loosening up' around you.  What does loosening up mean to you?  Does it mean you think she is going to be 'ready for sex' when she is finally loosend? (smile)    She is warning you to 'stay away' with your touchy feelys!!!!!  PMS means we may be a witchiepoo for a day or so, or be on a short wick tempermentally speaking.  It may also mean 'dont crowd me'.  So give her space and remember the 'dates' because it happens every 21-28 day cycles!  Welcome to our life as women!!!!!    If she is not prepared to 'hold hands' then dont', and don't try again.   Let her lead the way here, just be yourself, stop the panting....and get to know her.  You need to allow her into your mind.  When I was dating I noted 'boys' did not like talking about their 'feelings'.  This is a major 'block' to dating.  One must know how one feels in order to get to know one.  Surface superficial friendships will never know themselves on a deeper level.  One moves on every 3=6 months or so, until one day, they meet one they truly connect with, and they allow the intimate feelings to surface and connect with their mates feeling.  Then love can grow.  Being in a dating scene is rife with prejudices and judgements.  Looks become the more, than the person.  Mistakes are made here and feelings hurt when one ones intimacy and the other prefers to be ego driven.  Control and manipulations happen when one tries to hard.  When you persist.......they will resist.    Best to let things go as they are, and allow spirit and mother nature to take her course.  To force the will, will force reaction, rather than taking time to allow gentle response.  Say it with flowers, or little things....this is the way to a girls heart.  Be more gentle and honest and give that little more of yourself.  The worst that can happen is that you will be free to pursue more friendships....Cant be all that bad hey????    Blessings be yours in light and peace  Harriett Potty ;)|`|AA11610394	sure holding hands is fine but dont go further without a ring...|`|AA11322886	sure try it again and be nice about it|`|27c08441c89365e9386e05b7acaf0e47aa	yeah try it again|`|0eeb948486d05d47f2a697bf50063ec2aa	Yah, try it again    Good Luck =)|`|7a3e89a079c1e07d72aaec6767fdd993aa	say to her directly that i love u and i love to kiss ur hand so plz give me ur hand

AA11533607	If you really want to live where he is at sure go for it.  Make some plans though.  Talk to him and set a date for the move.  Then next time you visit do some job hunting.  Try to line up employment to start shortly after your move date.  You'll feel more secure about the situation if you're not completely reliant on him.  Good luck!|`|AA12359948	If the two of you love each other like you say you do why not wait until the war is over and his duty station is more permanent,then pursue the relationship from there.|`|AA10404172	First of all, can you both afford this.  He cannot get money to use for a place to live if you are not married.  Military Pay is not alot so you may have to get a job also where you two want to live. Yes, I did do this along time ago myself.  You should think this over good before making a choice of what to do.|`|22e93cb613e9a3965d85152fbc6e8934aa	One thing you can't avoid in the military is time apart. My father would go away for 6 months at a time sometimes for warrant officer training. It takes a very strong, faithful and dedicated woman to do this.    No one is going to really be able to answer these questions except you. Don't rush into it. You don't mention how long you've been dating, but if it's anything less than a couple of years, I would strongly suggest you proceed with caution. You also don't mention how old you and the boyfriend are. If you haven't had time to live life a little before settling down, you should give serious thought to what you want to do by when. You mention school. What are your goals in life? How is his time in the military going to affect your goals? How is moving possibly every 3 years going to affect your goals? How transferable are the credits for whatever degree you're trying to achieve? A relationship is two people - His goals matter, and so do yours. His life matters, and so does yours. Do your goals mesh or clash? Do you fight about things like money, individual goals, etc? A relationship is always going to have it's rocky patches, regardless of your respective professions.    You come across like your head and heart are in the right places but still seem like you want to live life a little bit. I'm not trying to be insulting or rude, just commenting from an outside perspective.

AA11110297	Men talk and they keep track of women who allow themselves to be used for sex. Stop hanging out in the places you are known to be seen in(such as bars/clubs). Find out where good men go in your area ---- my best dates have been with men I have met at the grocery store and the bookstore/library.    Don't have affairs -  and present yourself as a lady. Ask close family/friends  to help you find someone who's nice to date...or even try a dating service (one that is well established and has a good reputation).|`|7941db8aae4ffaebc845d12c6575ca9eaa	i know the feeling. head to church, that should fix it.|`|4b6d12f9d2e7ee3be8fcf843df41a411aa	stop looking ...let it find you|`|d0c3f7b31aa7d8f568478a0bad6c9137aa	well try not to give off that impression that you enjoy sez or you will give it too early on. try taking your time getting to know someone without sex. and see if the guy really like you|`|e09f4f87531dbb88343af29ad808aba4aa	Then you must make them take you seriously!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  Ask God to send you the man that he wants you to have!!!!!!!    But you must have a lot of patience!!!!    One day I was watching Joyce Meyer and she has a new book called " I Am In A Hurry But God Is Not"    The title alone is very interesting, We want what we want when we want it.  You not meeting a good guy is because you are looking for them and once you find them you are begging them to be your ideal man, I know because I have been in your shoes.  I was dating a guy that only saw me when he wanted to see me and I allowed him to do this to me.  Why?????? Because I was desparate, lonely, and had low self esteem.  But one day I got down on my knees and asked God to send me the man you want me to have!!!!!    I meant it from my heart, I did not give up.  All the usual guys,no good guys that I would let into my world, I said no to them, I stopped letting them treat me bad.  We need to take responsibily for some of the bad things that happen to us.  Set higher goals, standards, aspirations for yourself.  Make men respect you,if they care they will stay around.I have been married for 4 years.  When my husband and I met each other we were friends first!!!!!!    I told him what I wanted in life and he told me that he wanted the same.  He even excepted my children as his own, their own father has not been in their life since 2004 off and on.    God is awesome, if he did it for me he will do it for you, trust me he will, do not give up!!!!!|`|5350c2fc385dc9ccf69fde85ca5a9a5aaa	If your 19 too 25 meet my son. he never finds a serious woman.

You will answer your own question pretty fast.  If you want him back, tell him the sex returns when he does as part of the family.  Good luck|`|AA11110297	Don't be having sex with your ex --- don't you remember why you two divorced?   Be polite to each other and raise your child.  Let him unload his feelings with a psychiatrist....|`|fa5c4f373a8de64cffa0f9041aaa803aaa	Do you like just waiting to see how it will work out? You haven't discussed it but you're sleeping together. This only can complicate what you're feeling. If you have doubts, then you have answered some of your own questions. What is your agenda? Do you want to have a relationship again? Start answering your questions and stop wondering what he wants and if he is playing a game. Be honest enough and say what YOU want. This way there won't be any misconstruing the information.|`|AA10858602	Never go backwards.  Anything that wasn't resolved from when you two were married will come back if you get into a relationship again.  If he cheated, you will still have the major trust issues.  This is just my opinion, on the other hand strange things have happened with people.  Relationships that you think would never work out, end up working.  Make sure if you give this another try, it's something you both really want, I bet your daughter would be thrilled if it worked.|`|916defff9f90dc5ff83a115c2e622ecdaa	Always remember... there is a reason that you two divorced.  Now after saying that, do you really think you want to try it again?  Just something to think about.  After time people seem to forget what happened and get back together & then it starts all over.  You need to make sure this is what you want & then make it plain to him & see how he reacts.    Good Luck|`|AA10796295	I'd imagine after 6 yrs that you have a pretty good idea what your ex's motives are.  You have to stop thinking about what his intentions are and figure out what it is that you want.  Take control of your life and the games will be just that, games.  I think that the fact that you had sex means that you are holding on and think that he may be true.  But only you know.  If you take some time to yourself and get your act together and don't worry about the ex, then you can gain some perspective on where you are at.  You are insecure and vulnerable and good decisions are not made in this condition.  Take care of your daughter and yourself and figure out what YOU want.    Good Luck
AA10053890	You might want to tell her how you feel about it.. don't get up in her face, but tell her that you worry about her going off with two guys that you don't know.. that you trust her, but since you don't know them you can't really say if you trust them or not.  Let her know.. I'm sure that if she loves you she will understand your fears.

Males want to be domineering . They always have and always will . They think they are the strongest the biggest the bravest . All this for what ? To get a mate . When they are young teenagers the body says I'm king of the hill .  I want it my way I'm a man .The mined says I want to play games and go out to play . Have my friends around me and be free like a child .  That's where the conflict comes in . They don't know what they want and anger is the release . But it doesn't stop there .

Scrapbooking is my favorite - you guys could do start a scrapbook with a page about each other - (ie-  you would make a page about her, and she would make a page about you) and then give them to each other!  If you aren't into scrapbooking, there are lots of other art projects at Michael's & AC Moore.  Maybe you could even bring out the little kid in each other and finger paint!    Arts & crafts are always fun, too, because you can pop in a DVD of your favorite show - and watch while crafting.  Don't forget the pizza and soda!    Have fun!!
b958da2ca3d5edcdbcf0e0ea05325aa8aa	I think that is great.  :)  Maybe you could print what you say out on nice paper and frame it in his room as well.  Or do a sand ceremony with a coloured sand for your stepson and make a candle out of it.    "You are young as I speak, but my love for you has been since beginning.  What you will not remember, I will never forget as I speak these vows with my heart.  I promise as I watch you grow to love you, to guide you while letting you set your own path in life.  I promise to listen as a friend, a guardian and a parent in your life.  I will be here for you as we laugh, cry and experience life together.  Today as a family we say our vows of love and together as we leave this place we begin an anticipated journey, together.  I promise to you I will always remember this vow"    I dunno...just thought of that one for wording.  :)  Your step son is gaining a wonderful Mom.  Remember; love and "step" are both four letter words....and he has both from you.    Congrats and have a wonderful wedding and life.|`|73c6084fbad1e11c3464ca98280bfa78aa	One of my girlfriends just did this about a year ago.  Granted her children were older (9 and 11), but during the ceremony, she gave his children a small pin and vowed to always be there for them, promised to love and cherish them as if they were her own and pledged her undying devotion to make sure they have everything they need as a family unit throughout life.  It was a tear jerker.      I know the baby is young, and his adjustment towards you is going to make this so much easier, especially the friendship you've developed with his mother.  You'll figure it out...just speak from the heart and you can't go wrong.|`|AA11110297	Do what you think is best - it's your wedding day !    (Since you have already established yourself as a caring step parent , I don't see why you need a vow for step son since you've accepted him with open arms - Just keep doing that always and he'll appreciate having a wonderful step-mom!)|`|13e1f795804daca050ff9391958250b7aa	talk to the baby's mom and your fiance for starters, make sure they are alright with it.

Just remember the vows are really for the people saying them and who they are being said to. With this in mind I dont want you to think I am against the idea, simply that the child you are making the vow to will not be able to understand. BUT!!! Seeing your wedding video later will really set the tone for a much easier teenage years.     Will the child be at the wedding? If not a childs vow will be a bit out of place, saying something in your vows will be nice however.|`|AA10833056	thats great idea although i think you should speak freely as everyone eles has pointed out such as you will do with the new hubby but maybe beacause he is so young you should get him a baby pin or braclet as you love for him i do think that you should approch his mother and explain that you do love and want him in your life as much as you want your new hubby  and i am sure she will not mind that you r doing this for her son|`|c5d636c7b0f3bb4bfd4ccd9a0985eff5aa	YESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA10365022	That's a new one on me Ihave never heard of childrens vow...|`|ad8377952ada3bc187f4897a0b32eff4aa	I think a children's vow is a beautiful idea.

Just webcam, e-mail, text message and talk continously and you won't miss a beat, plus when you see eachother you can't keep your hands off eachother.

It was not his intent to enter into anything permanent with you.   I find it very hard to believe he is in a relationship he "hates" and is only with his girlfriend because he doesn't want to be alone.  I can't think of any guy that would say this EXCEPT to make his other girlfriend feel better.    When you move, you can certainly see if he'll start dating you.  It's not as if you're strangers, nor is he married, he can certainly break up if he wants to.  Even if he doesn't want to date you he obviously considers you a friend since he's loaning you money.|`|beab0655fc49c8100b095fe45ae0179baa	oops its a pretty complicated problem, well its he who matters for you right, then you dont have to worry about her, if you have fully trust in your man, then you dont have to worry of anything else    take care  and good luck|`|b92f8453c97d48616fbf70c1f8a72a78aa	Are YOU married? you dont say but i would suggest this guy wants both or he would be with you not his "girlfriend" if she is sooooooo bad why is he with her and not you? This guy is playing you. Just like when a guy says he will leave his wife for the other woman (sadly Hun that is who you are) if she knows about you then you cannot do any harm asking her can you? You deserve no less than the truth. Stop deluding yourself wake up and smell the coffee.

99253800504d467d3ddd9cb808103f2aaa	Si una mujer te pide tiempo... (mas all de todas las cosas que te puedas llegar a preguntar de los porques, raznes, motivos y demaces)....es porque sin lugar a dudas es lo que est NECESITANDO... TIEMPO.    Cuando una mujer te pide tiempo... uno puede reaccionar de 2 maneras:     A)- O uno le brinda lo que nos est pidiendo sin protestar, comprendiendo que necesita un poco aire para pensar (sea lo que sea), mostrando una actitud seria y madura, sin atosigamientos pero tampoco perdiendo el interes en ella. (es decir, intentando actuar de la forma mas equilibrada posible)    B) No se lo brinda, protestar, se encapricha, se ofende y se hace la cabeza con los porques, y etceteras etc etc... (casi lo mismo que hace un ni?o cuando no tiene lo que quiere y se encapricha) Terminando todo  con un conflicto de por medio, generando una perdida de confianza y confirmando que, al fin de cuentas, no somos lo suficientes maduros como para una relacin en  serio.    Todo queda en que es lo que tu quieras. Eso s, es dificil comprender al otro si uno se mantiene en su posicin y no ve un poco las cosas desde el otro punto de vista. Por ejemplo: Si te dice que no la quieras tanto es porque de seguro se est sintiendo presionada y por consiguiente cree que est perdiendo la libertad que antes tena cuando estaba sola y no le est gustando mucho la cosa.   Generalmente las mujeres son mucho mas maduras que los hombres y lo mas preciado para ellas es la independencia personal en todos los aspectos de su vida, no le gusta sentirse esclavizadas. (ya tuvieron bastante que soportar durante toda la historia de la humanidad)    Yo te recomendara que, si en verdad la queres, le des ese tiempo (y de paso datelo a ti tamben) Luego vers... hay que darle tiempo al tiempo, y siempre es preferible que las cosa terminen como corresponden y dejar aunque sea un peque?a puerta abierta, pues uno nunca sabe que podr suceder despues.

Just like anything , time will tell if it stays strong and gets even stronger. Just keep on being that sweet honest guy you have been thus far.

Let her know by the way you do things. They always say that actions speaks louder than words.. so prove to her by your actions how much you care for her and she'll believe you afterwards.|`|3f842c862393900d47437e347ba3138caa	tell her what you just told us... that you really care about her, and want to give your relationship a real shot. Explain to her how you feel, as well as your stance on cheating and cheates in general. You say you've known her for 4 years, so she should have a good idea of what kind of person you are, and whether or not you're trust-worthy. Even those of us who have been betrayed, though more suspicious, still want to find love.. hopefully she's not too scared of being hurt to give the long distance a try. All things considered, 5 months isn't that long, and 5 hours isn't really THAT bad (my boyfriend and I are seperated by an ocean, and there's still a year and a half before I'm able to move back home to be with him.. but we love each other, and want to be together, and are willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen).

I don't know how long it's been for her, but you have to wait until she's ready.  If she isn't over her heartache from the guy that hurt her, and is still leary of commitment; it could hurt your relationship.  The most important thing I learned that last time I got hurt was to never take the old boyfriend into the new relationship.  There isn't room for three, and you aren't him.  If you have been friends for 4 years, you are proving yourself to her.  She should know by now what kind of guy you are.  My best advice would be to show her this question.  It's filled with honesty and sincerity, and any girl loves to see things in writing.  I think you stated your feelings beautifully in this question, and I wish you the best of luck!|`|AA11446911	Follow yo heart all u can do is tell her and pray for the better. because the Bible says "cast all your cares on to the Lord" so you do your part in lettin her kno and then you just let it go and let God handle it.B/c we cant force sumone to like us more so love us so jus keep your head and if she isnt the one I pray to God u find her.|`|afc5e0d3cd86a1d1de50fc5902670da0aa	The best thing you can do is talk to her and  tell her how you feel about her. Tell her that it is only a short seperation and there are tons of ways you can communicate to each other in that time.       Ask her to help you look for a place, if you are looking.  And make a special space for her in your new place. This will help her see that you intend to continue the relationship. I hope this helps.|`|7a4b18f5f16ad3e2c0ca2736d6dce28aaa	Take it slow.|`|58b05a42d78f0df863773877c01f7007aa	I have been in a very similar situation, got involved with a Doctor from Up State New York, while I am a Canadian.   Our long distance love flourished for two years. I now live in the United States and we are going to get married next year.   So five month apart is really no big deal.  As far as her other issues regarding trust and/or bad experience with previous relationship, this is something that you both will have to work on together. Let her know that your intentions are Honourable, you are not that guy and she must start getting over her past, isn't it a shame to let a former moron ruin your future with a good man? I mean, its' just plain ridiculous. You love this girl so be assertive and confident, My fiance and I used to call each other every night when we were in different countries. no matter how late, just to say goodnight.   also, get a computer and a web-cam. She can clearly see that you are not with anyone else and you get to see each other everyday even when u are apart.  Have faith and good luck,  Irene|`|632e4ae1417e052b5896511b07931332aa	You shouldn't have to prove anything to her.  Just ask her out.  If she likes you and has any sense, she will agree to go out with you.  If she says she likes you but doesn't want to go out with you, you can try pressing her for the truth if you like.  Just say "gee, you must not like me much if you aren't willing to take a chance on me" or something like that.  If she doesn't like you, there's a good chance she will be peeved . . . but it doesn't matter then, does it?

Good luck.|`|c86b2c8948f38551c3c71b2587082c13aa	We do need reassurance after bad relationships.  Just be honest with her about how you feel.  Show her that she is special to you.

d182ec57f7a7c22b93cf5d1eb30a5b3eaa	First of all, please accept my condolances on the loss of your step mother, as well as the regretable behavior of your siblings.   That said, please, for the sake of your inner peace, do some hard thinking. Which is more important to you - preserving your mothers memory, or saving a relationship with your siblings, and are they mutually exclusive?   Then ask the hard questions. Get a lawyer to help you execute her will and resolve the estate. Put a freeze on the bank accounts and property so that things can be divided fairly and according to the will. That will go a long way to ease the tension, becuase it dictates your mothers last wishes. She may have willed specific items to certain people, or named an executor to be in charge.   Also, talk to your family. Try to use this as a bonding experience to bring you closer, not drive you apart or cause an arguement. Im sure you are all greiving and hurting, so try to remember that, and act honorably. Im sure your mother would want you all to get along and resolve things peacefully. Tell them why you are feeling the way you do, and why the bed is meaningful. Hopefully they are understanding, and if not, that is what the laywer and will is for, to equally divide the estate up. Good luck, and once again, Im sorry.|`|AA11755944	give the bed back and appear in probate court.  your stepsister may be overstepping her bounds, but the best way to hande it is through the court system.|`|AA11145682	srry|`|473bbbff6148929a5d6f1f414cf6555caa	i feel your grief and offer my most honest and deepest symphathy|`|0cdf154bbca23d537f31edf59cca254caa	Im sorry for your loss, i hope everything goes ok and your doing good. i know how hard it is to loose a loved one and you need to have family around you to support you and all i would keep the bed and ask your step sister to come over so you guys can talk maybe she is just depressed that her mother died just talk and figure everything out good luck|`|01909fee3655e32929e012c0d8b6e520aa	Keep the bed, by all means, and GET A LAWYER.|`|32aafcbe79d82e713d05fbfb841747efaa	im sorry|`|293460a31870b46dc13b845485225b73aa	Don't give her the bed and find out what is in the will.

Hope you have the strenght to go through it or to seek professional help with your grief if needed.    Your stepsister lost her mother and now is not the best time to expect her to be reasonable, she's grieving.     Tell her you are keeping the bed for sentimental reasons, she already got everything else. But try to do it calmly and don's get into an argument with her, don't make it sound like you resent her for getting everything (your stepmother should have split everything after she offered)Try to offer your shoulder to cry on, just be firm in telling her your stepmother gave it to you and you are keeping it.    If its alot of money and she has been your stepmother for a long time maybe after the grief she'll be reasonable and share it if not life goes on. GOOD LUCK.|`|AA12143710	may her soul rest in peace

Just tell him you want him to be more assertive.|`|bbcdb2e958163c213128fc642753b1ddaa	No , talk to him if he love's you he will understand, if not get you'r self a real man that knows how to treat a lady !!!!!!! good luck|`|6c7c7a0edf84cf33f84c80913d934f1caa	I dated an unassertive guy once before.  For me, it didn't work out because I am assertive and maybe even intimidating.  But as you said, the unassertive ones are sweeties because they sit back and just let you make all the decisions and don't make a fuss -- very easygoing -- which is an excellent quality in a guy.  In the end, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and it sounds like this isn't a really big deal for you, which is good.  You have to accept him for who he is and don't try to change him.  The only thing I could say is support him since he sounds like he's sensitive, don't criticize and if he ever is assertive with you, make sure he has a positive response, so he'll act assertive more often.|`|95ee1a959c00413e4ae4f09c39c7e273aa	Wishing is normal but trying to change others is futile.  No one is 100% perfect; many good points should be enough to keep your love growing. Focus on the good points, and do not ask him for making unimportant decisions.  Whenever possible be assertive for both of you, if he does not object.  Happy holidays to both of you.|`|2c67ac074c89a815d1e8332f857c694daa	You'll tend to have that with the "nice guys".  Had the same conversation with my wife (gf at the time).  I was a bit unsure and insecure of myself.  But when we talked about it, she never talked-down to me and always treated me as an equal.

AA11128712	Sounds to me like she's trying to push you into asserting yourself, and the more you submit to her rudeness, the more verbally abusive she's going to get.  Try telling her that you love her but you're not going to put up with her rudeness any more, and that the next time she tries it you're going to put her across your knee, take down her panties and spank her soundly until she's genuinely sorry.    Say it quietly but firmly, so she knows you mean it.    And then - make good on it!|`|d7490b6294d187bf6a8b66924236ae16aa	physical action against her won't solve anything, friend.      Doing literally everything she wants out of a desire to please her doesn't make her your equal - it makes her your master.  She is only treating you with the same self-respect that you're treating yourself.   The fact that she considers herself a boss rather than an equal, same thing - it's because you do not assert your equal stature.    Seems to me you have two choices:    1)  Quit complaining and learn to enjoy it.   Yes, that is a viable possibility, although you may not like the consequences.  Basically what it would mean is you simply accept her authority over you, and keep doing whatever she wants - the arguments will decrease, there will be peace in the household.  However, eventually you may find yourself in the situation of serving a glass of wine to her and her boyfriend before they go up to your bed together. And if you keep going down that road, you may actually enjoy it.  But it would mean leaving it to her to set the terms of the relationship, including deteriming when and if it is over.   It is possible that this is the only type of relationship she wants - she may be a "control freak" who can't stand a long term relationship with a man unless he is subservient to her.    2)  Your other choice is to assert yourself.  Refuse to do some of the things you're doing just for her.  Stand up for your rights.  Occasionally defy her.  Call her out when she's being "shrewish."  This runs the risk of a fight that breaks up the relationship, true - but it also might be what she's craving - you to stand up to her and have a fiery relationship which runs hot and hotter and from anger to love and back.  What it might mean about being a "real man" is simply quit acting like a doormat.   That doesn't mean treating her as a doormat, but it does mean enjoying yourself for your own sake - doing things you enjoy because you enjoy them, regardless of what she thinks about it.
7bec1a32293761994f20fad00693b077aa	this is not acceptable behavior and i'm surprised your parents allow it. Becasue your parents refuse to listen to your complaints you should tell an adult you trust to help you in your situation.|`|AA11128712	Ann, you asked this same question about two weeks ago.  I answered it then, but maybe my answer didn't help?    Might help to know a little more about the situation.  How old are you?  What kind of things does your brother spank you for - or is he just using any excuse and spanking you because he enjoys it?  What do your parents say when you talk to them about it?    I still reckon your best bet, if reasoning with your brother or your parents doesn't get you anywhere, is to ask some outsider for advice - family friend, teacher, relative or maybe the local minister if your family's religious.  Anyone your brother might be likely to listen to.    Hope this helps.  Email me if you want to.

I would be upset also if my significant other did this to me.|`|0f1dc9aa53fa3349822f55a55c6f3550aa	I think he has a right to be upset - I mean, if you couldn't even call him or email him a Happy Birthday - then how much do you care about him?|`|AA11020911	Some boyfriend you have.

Debes tener presente que para amar tambien es necesario saber que todo tiene un final. De ti depende que tipo de final le des a la relacion, el tiempo ayuda y bastante, date tiempo quiza para llorar, para recordar, para extra?ar, para reflexionar, para asimilar el fin y sobre todo para valorar lo bueno que te ha dejado como ser humano. Recuerda que nada es eterno simplemente asimila la experiencia Aprende. caete, date en la torre, llora pero siempre siermpre Levantate. Dedicate tiempo para ti, tu te lo mereces, aferrarse no ayuda solo te lastimaras. No trates de olvidar solo aprende.El tiempo y la vida haran lo que les corresponde no te afanes solo date tiempo. Y si l ya no desea estar a tu lado es kiz xk ya vivieron todo lo que como pareja tenian k vivir, deja fluir las cosas, y si es para ti Volver dejale a Dios, a la vida y al tiempo que hagan su trabajo. No pretendas que las cosas sean como tu kieres que sean pues es un hecho que siempre habr algo mejor y esto debe servirte para evolucionar como ser humano. Hay situaciones verdaderamente tristes por las que muchas otras personas estan pasando y sabes? Ni se quejan, simplemente asumen el reto de seguir adelante. Aprende, Valorate, sigue Adelante y no desesperes pronto sanar tu alma.

Personally i can never tell if girls are trying to say they like me or i just think they are because i didn't quite understand what they where trying to get across which is quite annoying because i never stop wondering "what if they meant" So you can be discrete with it but make sure its clear.    Edit:  i actually agree with a_begeng i think it would be a lot easier if you just told the guy straight up that you have feelings about them it is very direct and clear. of course there is the down side of possible rejection but trust me from experience its not nice wondering what if.

MhpccWpmaa	BV can be contracted through many means... You can get it from almost anything.  Wiping back to front instead of front to back, sitting on a public toilet seat, using soap down there, having sex that upsets your pH balance down there allowing bad bacteria to flourish.... so many different things.  Some people say that you can't pass it through sex, some say you can.  It's not an STD. Many virgins get it so if it were an STD that would be impossible. I think that only way that sex can cause it is if there's bacteria on your partner that upsets your balance down there or if he ejaculates inside you it can do the same thing.  Oral can also cause it sometimes because people have so much bacteria in their mouths|`|69uizI7Naa	Here's a good website - I just googled it:    What is bacterial vaginosis?

Mow-days kids are so mean to the other kids that are over weight but don't be down on yourself.

Good luck to you and keep your chin up, it will all work out! :)|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Mark, instead of doing away with yourself, how about improving yourself?    Yes, you need to lose some weight. You also need to get healthy in ways unrelated to your weight. Being friendless isn't healthy. Being depressed isn't healthy. Pining after a girl who is unattainable isn't healthy.    Get out and do things which put you with other people. It doesn't have to be at school. Get a job, volunteer, join activities at your church or community center, take a class in something fun, join a gym or become a regular at a place you can walk or run, yada-yada-yada.     Smile at people, say hi or good morning, work on starting conversations--the start of all friendships. Be more interested in other people than in yourself, and you can get through these tough times.    FWIW, every happy adult I know (including both our kids, myself, and my husband) was fairly miserable at your age. It does pass, and knowing that might help.|`|TqwN67Xkaa	Let me tell ya this bud. I am now 24, I am 280 pounds and I have never had a girlfriend or been kissed either. My problems may be diffrent from yours. I have way to high standards. I have been over 200 pounds since I was in the 6th grade.    Problem is this, you have to decide and be real with yourself. Look at the girls you are going for. Are they out of your league? be honest with yourself, cuz you know the answer. When I was in high school I chased the hottest girls ever, and failed. Girls are very immature in their teens. They will not want someone who will love and take care of them.    I could have lowered my standard and pulled some hoodrat girl just so I could get laid or something, but thats not what I want. If you just want to have a girl and dont care about who, or why then get yourself out there. If you want a good girl that you love and she loves you, then be patient. It will happen sooner or later bud.     Doing harm to yourself is never the answer. it always seems like it is, but it isnt. You need to do a few things. Decide if you just want to get laid or if you want a real relationship. Work on your confidence. Dress yourself up, be confident in yourself. Even if your overweight you can still get chicks. You have to walk into a room like you own the place and girls will notice the self confidence you have.|`|WYP4ZzXiaa	Whatever you do,just do not harm yourself.Running away is a little bit better(wow,now i sound like a horrible person lolz)but you will regret it.

They are probably just messing with you because your an easy target, show em whos boss girl:)|`|Dxh0vIyQaa	the guys taht make fun of your weight are just..bullies.  the other one just wants to make you feel better, i do that to a kid.    are you disabled or something?    no they don't like you unless they ask you out.    sorry  goodluck1@ !:]|`|e98RKB35aa	Whatever floats your boat.|`|bRoFUcIgaa	Okay, the guys who make fun of your weight don't like you- their just jerks basically. The second guy who asks you for high fives probably is just being friendly, asking for a high five doesn't mean they "like" you- sorry to break it to ya.|`|IU0LQQw8aa	haha your in 6th grade dont be worried about it|`|pfke6Jieaa	ur only sixth grade those boys r stupid get used to it. u dont need to be complaining but u DO need to get off the computer and do ur homework lil girl.|`|J0JpREcwaa	they might like u. u should ask one to dance with them at the next dance u have, if u still like them.
K6D34WQFaa	not really your just stuck on him and that's normal but it sounds like he's using you he's most likely not going to leave his gurl anytime soon he just said that to make you happy|`|YAwvszITaa	what are his reasons for not leaving her yet?
FNkaIhaLaa	hmm, lol well, if he ends up staying with this other gurl, obviously thing's were not meant to work out. and i can bet ayone 100$ he does miss you, he just doesnt have the gut's to admit it after what he did to you. if him and the other gurl dont work out, he ill probably move onto another gurl, and then finaly realize he wants you back.. but that's when ugotta hold your ground and say no because you dont want this sort of thng to happen again. not all men are the same, and your life will go on and you might find the right guy for you. but after reading what  said about him, he sound's helllla hella insecure about his feelings, he seemed unsure about what want's  here's the thing, Men = NEED women.   Women = Don't need men.. =/   sad but true. he probably was insecure about your guys relationship, maybe he thought u were losing feeling's for him, and turned to another gurl for support, but all in all, he did the wrong thing, you should not blame yourself because you dd NOTHING wrong.       hope this helpps|`|T7XERY4Waa	There is always someone else. Read The Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schnieder. I wish above all else I would have found these books sooner...I would have saved myself alot of heartache, 3 years of my life and alot of money! The key word of the day is NEXT!|`|Zgs4RncIaa	It's truly time for you to move on. God I know it's hard, but it is time.     He will eventually do the same thing to her. But if he doesn't and they do make a good pair, be the better person and just say good for him!    Now for you, you need time to heal. This is the hardest part. Go out and do things you like to do! Crying is good too. But when you have cried a river, you need to tell yourself, ONE last cry then I'm done!     NO man is worth dying over! I would say there are other fish in the sea, which there are, but most of them are scum bags (sorry to you good guys)!     You will move on in time, just give your heart time to heal. You will be the better person for not chasing after him.     Good luck sweetie.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Come on - you were played!    He's manipulative and controlling, he was able to fool you like this .... It wasn't that you weren't good enough, it was because you weren't smart enough. Even the Einsteins of this world can't figure out the mysteries of the human heart!     You need to develop emotional intelligence, my dear, and learn to spot when someone is genuine and when they are trying to fool you.    If it's any consolation, you are not the first girl to be played like this, and you will not be the last. If he does do it to anyone else, it's not your problem, don't obsess about it, just get on with your own life. It's something everyone has to learn to deal with.|`|AA10628838	Just be glad you found out before he cheated on you. He sounds like a loser anyway.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	You two only been with him 3 months? You need to move on men are scum like that, he was seeing her when he was with you meaning he didn't care enough about you or your feelings to stop doing what he is doing, as far as I think your better off, like his sister said its a pattern so he really did you a favor.|`|vSmop8Vhaa	"what if he stays with this girl and it turns out perfect with them"    then you need to let go. period.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I don't understand. You tell him you want time apart, and when he moves on you get upset. I would be happy that he is out messing with someone else and letting me go find someone that could really love me, and not play games with my life.  Don't make it more dramatic then it needs to be.  If you want to die because some guy treats you badly, just turn the corner there will be another looser to take his place.|`|GiTVrqyDaa	TIME let it go|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	OMG  He tells you he wants you  Then he tells you he doesn't  Then he tells you he does  Then you tell him to back off, YOU need time away from him  So he backs off and finds someone else and you say how dare he    OMG what's the name of this soap opera hon? For real? I missed the first few episodes.|`|EY2ixfZzaa	that a guy for ya!|`|o1yy6KABaa	hes not worth waiting round for, be glad that he hasnt hurt you more than  what he already has.   Time to move forward and find someone who treats you how you should be treated.|`|Xc9KZ4Fxaa	If I had a dollar for every time I heard a girl tell a story exactly like yours, I'd be rich. Trust me, you will get over him. It just takes time.Don't ever think of giving up on living over a guy you only went out with for 3 months.It just wasn't meant to be. Someday you will look back at this situation and think "He was such a loser, what was I thinking."|`|48Wd4b6iaa	You were only together for about 3 months.  He hurt you badly.   He was seeing someone at the same time he was seeing you.  His own sister says he's a cheater and won't ever settle for long.    So why are you missing him so much??! You should be patting yourself on the back for dodging the bullet! This is a guy who only wants a good-time girl and when he figured out that you were a forever type of girl he dumped you. Be happy! It's actually a compliment.     Who cares if this other girl makes him happy? Maybe she can turn his butt around. Just be thankful it's not you dealing with this wishy-washy two-timing jerk anymore.|`|dVlLahozaa	Move on and be glad that this is over in time when that doesn't work he will probably come back to you move on and never look back to that awful relationship.
evW18jvIaa	Threatening to kill himself seems like a super dramatic cry for attention that could definitely be used to distract you from that "gut feeling" you're getting again.    It sounds to me like a decoy. I'd go with my gut on this one...He could very well be cheating again.     I can't tell you to leave him, because I'm not in your shoes, but I can say to be careful. This doesn't sound good.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	He's creating the suicide drama to avoid facing up to and dealing with the real issue. He's not dead is he? No, he's laying in bed watching tv while you pamper him and keep your mouth shut. He played you pretty good.|`|f5083653e18cb526de8f4405892481deaa	I would put  a gps on his car...this will tell you if he has been to a motel or someones house..this is cheaper than an investigator.  I had someone follow my husband ..i spent $3,000 and never caught him, even though I knew he was cheating..the signs were there:   he stopped having sex with me, shaved his privates..etc..    I don't know if you can forgive him, if you do forgive him, your not supposed to bring it up anymore..though I know that's hard, but that's what therapists tell you...Good luck and remember this is your life..you only have one chance here on earth, so don't waste your life on jealousy and being upset, if you cannot forgive him, maybe there is someone better for you out there..because you did not deserve someone to disrespect you and cheat on you!!!
b71fd7cb98c2cfb6fa78323a60177c1eaa	he might be.  how the hell would we know?    edit: let me make myself more clear.  11th graders are still pretty young and do irrational things.  he might be doing something irrational.  second off, based on your typing and calling guys "guyz" and girls "girlz" i am guessing you are a ghetto retard, who would most likely end up with a ghetto retard guy.  making anything stupid or irrational possible    hope this helps|`|AA11145682	yea actually they do plan a lot of guys do like i'm gon break up wit her after this class at dis time in front of their friends like dat but i think u should move on dn't waste ur time on  no boy ur still in school|`|b180973d7a7a0a1413cc3e219ba66276aa	I dont understand your question. But maybe your friend is a physic.    or maybe he said something to her like...."If this and this and this doesnt happen by the second term of gr.11...im going to dump her"....and it got miss-interpretted.    or maybe your friends a lier....|`|e9ecc6de0c6da91b2fa982f7fdcaf2c7aa	if you love (like a friend) your bff then dump him befor he dupes you|`|a35e01879683eba6f0f11e821dd3d801aa	Well I don't know without actually being your boyfriend, but of course people plan when they are going to break up with someone.  Especially if its someone they care about, because they'll want to plan it and think about it beforehand so they can do it in the gentlest way possible.  Its rarely an act of spontenaity (sp?), unless you get into a couples fight or something.    So, it could be true or it could not be.  No one knows but him, so he should be the one to ask.  He is your boyfriend after all; and when you're in a relationship you do need to talk to each other o.o;; Maybe if you spoke to him you could prevent him from breaking up with you; maybe you find out its not even true.  I don't know.    Speak to him about it.
vcuX3Krqaa	I know right? I'm like that ALL THE TIME. I'm exactly like you. I feel so stressed out and I just want to scream my head off, and then I'm all happy and silly. It's really wierd    Things can get really confusing in teen years.. [[I would know]] and there is definitely nothing wrong with you. I found a few things to do when I get really stressed out. I bought some really cheap yoga dvds, and those helped ALOT. It helps all your stress leave your body. Also, you could watch tv, it helps get your mind off things. It kind of calms you down so your not focussed on your stress. It also helps if you find a really good book while listening to music so it takes up even more of your concentration.     It never really fully takes away your stress.. but it helps. but nothing is wrong with you. I'm like that all the time. Just enjoy the time when your really happy, and take my advice when you get really stressed. 10 points please? i really need it..  well.. hope that helps (: good luck.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	teen years im guessing!?  its a hard time  and its not easy to always be happy  being stressed out and depressed is okay  im like that 90% of the time  and im only happy with friends and my boyfriend  theres definitely nothing wrong with you  it happens to people all the time  its just a very stressful time of life  i hate it, but things will get better! :D|`|Km2nzm3saa	I think it is normal.  Stress is crazy.  I was the same way in high school.  Find something to do, like yoga, painting, SOMETHING, to de-stress. You will be thankful later.|`|VO4CQPX8aa	Maybe you are like bipolar or something|`|6g7gmxzWaa	"God gave you a brain use it"|`|KDc135ovaa	I dont think theres anything really wrong w/ that. sometimes ur stressed, sometimes ur happy. thats life. and highschool is ST-RE-SS-FUL so is middle school and college. I'm like that in ways too, i can get excited for no reason, and sad/depressed for no reason. and im NORMAL|`|kL5fQUGDaa	Lol same here. My mum says it's just mood swings... but it's not... I know I have a problem :S    Really wish I knew what to do...    x
517722e044003718f8f92512815e4c2eaa	date him. if you dont like it ,be a real *****. make him not like you. if nothing else, it would be fun:)|`|fHEebnMkaa	Try to get him a psychiatrist so this psychiatrist can help him get used to certain things.  He may be obsessed.  He's no Hannibal Lector.|`|jj9G0BBraa	My advice is to be careful and watchful.Many a girl has met a twisted fate. Do NOT be careless.Ask a few people you can trust not to open their mouths.Find out if this guy can be a potential threat.I'm a guy, and sometimes I feel a little angry and jealous or sad if I see a girl I like around other men, or showing them attention, but I keep in mind that it is their lives and I have no right to interfere.Does this man see things the same way?|`|OfRITFHAaa	Well he obviously has no one in the world that loves him . And the small amount of attention you gave him , was like hope to his empty cold heart . People die when no one loves them or cares about them .     So he must have been raised by parents that gave him very little love .     A mental institution , can give people meds , but they can't give love or hope of love .     He is Jealous because your small amount of love is like food to a bird in the winter , in which other birds will fight over .     People are such sad cases , and the world can be a dark , cold hearted place .|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	While its wise to be safe, looking at you and all that doesn't really mean he's obsessed. He might have a crush on you, just be infatuated. It might be he just likes checking you out. As a guy I can say that if I were locked up in some institution it'd be hard to ignore some attractive females.    What I would do if I were you is tell his primary psychiatrist, who ever is in charge of him, about this and see what he says. If he's already had a history of doing this with other women he'll know what to do. And if not, he'll still be aware of it and will be able to watch him more closely.    Just be careful if he gets really aggressive or assertive with you. If does anything that makes you uncomfortable, report it immediately. Do not give him the chance to hurt you, if possible.
R8K9H21Uaa	If you're nervous:  Move in half way and see if she moves in the rest of the way.     If you're brave: Of course you could say something sweet to get her to look at you when you two are close together and then go for it.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	stare at her in a very romantic way for like 2 secs... smile... lean closer... and *fireworks*... lol... be brave man!|`|xbMLtXOuaa	you go 90 percent of the way, she goes 10, unless she just closes her eyes, then its all you|`|jcVJM8FNaa	just close your eyes and lean in for it and hope for the best    it'll be ok|`|yA6uH637aa	dow! just go or it. ull get figure it out|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	like britney spears says, "just put your lips together and blow."|`|GQ6ssNdtaa	You move over and lip lock with her. How hard is this?|`|hH2XYpetaa	Whatever you do dont pucker your lips. Always a turnoff. Slowly caress her back for about seven seconds then proceed moth to mouth. CPR!|`|rnNGTYo9aa	START by getting closer to her   touch her hair, look into her eyes!  then touch her ear  SOFTLY  then go for the Kiss!!!  mmmmuaaaa     it'll work!!|`|LvI4jRd8aa	Just calmly move in to kiss her. maybe hold her face gently with one hand too. and don't stress out over it, she's your girlfriend, she want's you to kiss her.|`|MKHd10MYaa	Lean towards her face. When you two are real close, close your eyes and pucker up. She should meet you half way in the kiss, if not then just go the full way.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	When she looks at you just grab her chin gently and pull her into you and kiss her.|`|2LwPUoOvaa	If that happens again, don't get nervous.   First, glare into her eyes when shes looking up at you.  Then give her a romantic kiss on her forehead.  She'll smile. Then proceed for the one of the lips.  You start, she'll follow, and don't tense up man, it's simple.|`|6XqY0istaa	Gently cup her face in your hand (the one on the opposite side of where she's sitting) which will naturally turn you towards her, and give her a simple, soft kiss.  Pull back a bit and she will probably lean toward you to kiss you again.  Have fun  ;)|`|1e7578235af87deb4913ad0e4c75db44aa	move in with ur arm around her, then look into her eyes and close urs and kiss. go wit the flow.|`|IOMiV6e3aa	if you are unsure, then move in for a sweet kiss on the cheek and kinda let your face linger check to cheek and then. if she is moving closer and is receptive to that move that kiss to the lips with a little peck and another and then ...well go for the rest.|`|yIC6I9wHaa	tell her i love ur juicy lips can i kiss you   or when she looks at you just kiss her k good luck|`|fDzfPcgDaa	ok i have the perfect answer!! when she does that look into her eyes with a little smile and have a look in your eyes like i love you then look down @ her lips and up @ her eyes and do it again this tells a girl you are ready to kiss her. then lean in SLOWLY when the moment is right and kiss her but make sure she leans in too that would be bad if she wasnt ready.|`|kFFf3u2caa	Well first of all, you don't need to close your eyes. The first thing is make sure you heads are both in a position where you can move your necks a little. If you are too cramped or positioned weird you won't be able to make it as smooth as you want. Tilt your head to the left. Since you are the guy you should go a little more on her bottom lip. Not too much or it'll be on her chin. Just a little. Put your hands on her back or in her hair. I wouldn't go chin because it may make her feel like you have all the control. So good luck and relax. Just make sure you feel comfortable.|`|txhkQRD9aa	i have the best way because when a guy did this to me it made my heart jump out of my skinn.  when she's doing that, look down at her and wait til she looks up.  give her s little smile/smirk.  then place one finger under her chin and gently lift her face up more.  look her in the eyes, then at her lips, and kiss.  its like magic.|`|BDPIFYDcaa	you would be surprised how naturally it actually comes when you really want it!|`|QiWbcgWwaa	luk into her eyes lift her chin up n...... hope 4 da best  korny ? but seriously
NsYIUu3caa	it's probably different for everyone, the easiest way to get past it is to impose your will over the thought of fear and start moving around.  deliberate actions in order to accomplish anything.|`|E812Y8CUaa	It's anxiety, a panic attack. I get these. Try taking in a normal sized breath, hold it for three seconds, then as you slowly exhale, say the word relax slowly in your head. There is also calming drops and lozenges that help, can't recall what they are called, but go to the chemist. Also see a doctor in case it's a physical thing likean overeactive thyroid gland. There must be an issue bringing on these attacks, or high stress. Go see a counsellor to get to the root of it and try to deal with the issue.  I know how bad these attacks feel, so tense, so self aware and scared!  Stay strong, you can manage this!

She obviously has emotional problems so my suggestion is to avoid her at all costs.  Tell her NO THANKS, you wanted me out of your life and that is what you got.  Might seem harsh, but you will be doing her a favor so she doesn't act like a jerk with the next guy.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	It's Valentine's Day coming up and she hasn't found anyone new.

I know i am very carful with mine! I had a friend like that never talked to me for months then out of the blue wanted to meet again almost did but I thought about the last time and the way he treated me like if i was nothing so I had to take a step back and I am glad i did because has he contacted me anymore no so my feelings were right he would have done that same thing to me so I know i did the right thing and stayed away from someone who only likes to use people~ that hurts more then anything! but then again I knew what it was going in but did not think he would ever treat me like a door matt!!! now that hurts!|`|3iNobwVraa	Maybe she was just trying to be friendly?  You say she isn't trying to get back together with you, is that the problem?  BTW, one doesn't usually post a question about something one doesn't care about.  You want an answer about her intentions?  Ask her.      Sometimes, those who ask vague questions about what someone else thinks, feels, intends to others who would have NO WAY of knowing are not really after the information they profess to seek.  I say this because the only way to get that information is to ask her.  You don't because then she will know you're not what you say you are: over it.  Whatever.  It's pretty silly.  Just say what you mean.  Always.|`|DaKOec8aaa	...even if you do CIRCUS infront of her if she doesnt love you  anymore it worthless!   if you really love her, set both of you free and find your destiny...ooops! why dont you try me?  ...joke!!!

AA10048946	It'll happen, so just be patient.  Know that she's happy with the man of her choice and let you know your friendship is always availbale to her.  Don't try so hard to put her out of your mind. The way you're going can be emotionally frustrating, draining, tiring and not to mention unhealthy.  You need to focus on your needs, but don't rush it, let it come naturally. stop running from her and face your own life and what it's worth.    I got your back.|`|9bdb2a1e69d5abaf1badcf1d2338e36faa	Do anything to keep your mind off her, something you enjoy, who cares what it is, hang out with people, play bingo, play video games, play cards, volunteer, talk to other people on the computer, maybe get drunk a few times a week-really not a good idea but sometimes it helps, go walmart shopping all the time, find a penpal.|`|AA10097143	There is only one answer.

But....I think its time to move on and find new activities that don't include her.  Start dating other women.  If she's been a friend, you could try being honest with her because she's going to detect a change in your behavior.  Nevertheless, give it some time and some distance.|`|JbgZt0xEaa	You should see how she feels about you, tell her youre not trying to push her out of the relationship shes in but you cant stop thinking of her, if she doesnt like you, then maybe its good that you let her be. otherwise you jump in and hope to come out the other side with only a few bruises. good luck!|`|9ZPo8hnBaa	choose another girl  just time can help you  control your emotion or it can be worst to both of you  in this world not only 1 girls|`|0cc18a2d8ee588096040fb954ca5a550aa	I know what you're going through! I'm going through the exact same thing right now. My ex has a new g/f now. I was doing great until I saw that. Now it's all I think about too.

Answer B might contribute towards answer A. Another theory of mine is that he might be worried you won't want to go into his car anymore. The final suggestion from me is that it has absolutely nothing to do with the car. Would I act like this personally? No, but just try not to do any of the things I listed above. Good luck ^^

Y pues en cambio es mas dificil que alguien mas amable con mas nobles intenciones logre convencer a una chica es mas dificil, les llama mas la atencion el trato antes mencionado, y conste que lo digo por experiencia personal porque yo soy alguien con una situacion desafortunadamente muy similar a la tuya, no soy un santito pero si soy alguien con intenciones no tan machistas y depravadas pero un amigo que si tiene esas intenciones ha ligado muchisimas mas que yo, y en cambio a mi me echan por un lado pero ni modo que hacer, antes eso me preocupaba pero ahora ya no me interesa.    ah y cabe recalcar que bueno no soy ni tu tampoco lo eres ni nadie lo puede ser sobre la tierra, no hay gente buena asi que no te creas por eso la victima, no hay uno bueno solo Dios es bueno.

gK0vcdnDaa	E-Pics are casual and reflect the personalities of the couple.  I have mine coming up this Sunday and I'm stumped as to what to wear as well.     The dress is nice, and you can usually ask your photographer to do a few different outfits, just make sure that they are ok with it before hand.      If you are looking for something that is black and white then you could to a white or black tank/tee with the opposite color jacket and a dark-wash denim pant.  Depending on the weather you can just do a tank/tee in white or black, or even any shade of grey, or a shade of one of your wedding colors.  I live in San Diego where the weather is amazing, so I think I've decided to go with a dark purple dress top and a dark-wash denim.  My honey is in the Navy so we have pre-arranged to do some with him in uniform and me in a dress so that we have some formal photos.     Personally I love black and white photos as well - I find that wearing good colors convert to great B&W photos as well as looking beautiful when presented in color, and as a photographer I do suggest you stray away from black and white - but if its what you want then go for it.  Black and white tend to look very flat in photos, especially once converted to B&W and not as flattering unless you combine the two or create dimension another way.  No stripes, hold back on the polka dots or other strong patterns and logos.    Congratulations & Good Luck!!    -Elle    OH!  And remember to wear comfortable shoes, you don't want to put a damper on the day by having feet that hurt.    :)|`|26FPzSycaa	Just think of something classic and don't go with major trends of the times!    PS: Love the dress!|`|IGDVDuKfaa	thats a cute dress, I would wear it|`|5bqzuJntaa	Engagement photos usually show the real you. The EVERYDAY you. I think that dress would be a bit to much, if it isn't something that your friends would normally see you in. If they are used to seeing you all classy and dressed up than it would be cute. But if you are normally a jeans and t-shirt kind of gal, then I would keep it casual.|`|XK7elrmYaa	I've done some photographs of couples who are wearing patterns...it should be something you are comfortable in and something that makes you feel sexy and mostly something you won't mind pulling out and showing your kids 20 years from now!! Maybe arrange to change clothes mid way through so have some dressy ones in this dress that you love and then some in jeans and a button down or something more casual like that.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Our photographer gave us some basic rules: no busy patterns, no stripes, no hoods and no dresses or skirts. The dresses and skirts really inhibit how you can pose and move. The stripes on that dress are far too busy and would not be flattering in many poses. If you want to go dressy, try a dressy pant and cute top, they allow you to climb, squat, etc without the risk of showing your stuff.     Good luck!|`|8kdjvWAxaa	That is so cute!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Too busy for pictures.  Engagement pictures are to reflect your lives together.  If you're funky, great! Just not this dress in the photos.  Very distracting.    Edit - maybe a pair of black slacks with a white sweater or cardigan or poet-like shirt with some chunky black jewelry.  Have him wear black slacks with a white button down.  Just a thought.|`|5kwKeWsbaa	I think that dress is great.  As long as both of you are in similar semi formal attire it will be fine.  Congratulations|`|dUqgiKBPaa	i love the dress so much! but what i love about engagement photos is seeing the couple interact with each other and seeing their everyday lives! i think that is what engagement photo's should be like. your everyday appearance and attitudes! maybe you could wear the dress for your rehearsal dinner or something! but i think jeans are cutest for engagements although it is your wedding you and can do ANYTHING you want! your the princess :)

Also, introverted people take it worse then extraverts. In general, it is safe to say that it will almost certainly feel worse than you expect, especially if it happens with you for the first time.    If/when you breaku p, the best follow-up advice is to move on as soon as you can, and (1) never try to restore yourpast relationship and (2) think about it as little as possible. Note that this advice may be hard to follow and go against your instincts.

AA12345516	Sounds like friend  1 might like you as a little more than a friend and is jealous of your relationship with friend  2, so she is lashing out at her. If you are equally good friends with both girls then I don't think you should have said have anything about what one says about the other. But it also sounds like you like friend  2 better than you like friend  1. So it's really your call, but you are going to have to either make a decison about which girl you want remain friends with or make it clear to both girls that you are equally friendly with both of them and that you don't want to hear either knocking the other.

AA11128712	Do you enjoy it, even though it's supposed to be a punishment?  I know lots of girls whose b/f's spank them - my girlfriend, for one.  Nearly always there's some element of play-punishment involved, but essentially it's a mutual turn-on.    How long and how hard?  Well, I often spank my g/f for a couple of hours or so, and pretty hard too.

zYbT5dqFaa	Okay, first of all, I just wanna say that I've totally been in the girl's position before (all the guys thought I was a nerd till this year and suddenly, I'm in high demand. lol) so I can help you with what SHE's probably thinking through all this.   First of all, whatever you do, MAKE THE MOVE YOURSELF. don't leave it up to her. Because even if you ACT like you like her but don't specifically say it, she'll think you do, but won't want to make an idiot out of herself by asking or making a move on you. got it?  And as "fairly attractive" as you might be, I'd recommend getting to know her a little bit BEFORE asking her out, so you can be sure you really like her, and so she can get to know/like you. How to do this? Find a friend on the other side of the room to move by, or find another excuse to move over there, like "I can't see the board because of the person in front of me" (this is only if you're a wimp. If you really want to impress her, you'll move over there just for her. THAT would make her feel special.)  Don't just straight up ask for her number. Even though guys think it does, it DOES NOT impress girls. And don't be too cocky, but still a little bit. Girls tend to be attracted to guys that are comfortable with themselves, and not whiney, but they DON"T want a guy that's stuck on himself either.   Find ways to bump into her in the hallway. When you do, strike up a conversation. Let her get to know who you are. Or, go the round-about way and make friends with someone that she hangs out with a lot, so you'll end up being around her a lot, too.   And when you DO ask her out, or let her know that you like her, do it in a way that shows her that you really like who she is, that you think she's pretty, that you wanna be around her. Don't use the typical, "You're hot." and then add a lot of sexual crap. Sure, maybe it's a little nice to hear every once in a while... but just from a random guy. Girls just think of them as the type that want them for one thing only, so only sluts or idiots think they can keep a guy like that long-term. And she doesn't sound like a **** or idiot. Be sweet, confident, and straight-forward.  Good Luck, it sounds like she'd be lucky to have you, because if you take the time to do this for her, you get ++ points from me. lol|`|xmGFEt1Daa	Wow...nice to know that you're a lil cocky...j/k. Um just ask her on a date bro...if anything talk to her first and get to know her before you make a move. And don't worry about becoming rejected...everyone is not always accepted...|`|R0jzdts5aa	first you should talk to her and get to know her|`|YVdIs5B2aa	find a way to flirt cuz she needs to knoe u like her|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	just start by talking to her in the hallway about physics if you need a topic, and then start from there and ask if she has a facebook or such, then ask for her phone number|`|fHEebnMkaa	Try and talk with your school counselor about this, and maybe he / she will have the answers to your solution.  Hope this helps!|`|LEUaHjFJaa	id start with trying to talk to her as much as you can. dont over do it though you dont want to annoy her but maybe just a hi in the hall and stuff to. talk to her, make her like you|`|5YEKmHqyaa	Try to find little subtle ways to see her so you can flirt with her.  There is nothing wrong with asking her out to get to know her better, even if you haven't flirted w/ her alot.  That shows u are interested.  I say slip her a note or something if you cant talk to her in person.  Or just ask if she might like to grab a bite to eat or something.|`|zLDm0dElaa	I think you should first ask her if she wants to catch a movie or something.(Just as friends) and then ask if she wants to go on a date. Maybe things will fall into place.    Hope this helps = )|`|WsqV6Cy9aa	ewww bad *** ap physics wise *** hahahahhahahhahhhah|`|OCxXjSxAaa	talk to her, what would it hurt?|`|mPC8UQjaaa	IMHO, you should hang out with her outside of class before you ask her out. Don't try to meet her outside of school, because that might suggest something to her.  Also, if you like her only because she completely changed herself, I doubt you really like her. Maybe she's just going through a phase and will not be so rebel-ish once it's over. Wait a few more weeks, but in the meantime befriend her.  Hope this helps.|`|DEkvsUZ9aa	First off...your kind of an *** for not talking to her til she changed the way she looks. That's just mean. But ask for her number so you guys can hang out sometime cuz schools not a really good place to talk about that stuff...and go from there.|`|jcy5hXQnaa	First talk to her,  Get to know her...  Then later after you guys know each other  ask her if she could hang out  you guys can just like walk around or something  and then just ask her if she wants to get together  another time.  If she says yes on the next hangout start flirting little by little.  Then ask her if you can call her sometime  or if she can call you,  if yes  trade numbers.  After that if u want her to be your girlfriend,  ask her to be. Or if you want a hookup, your   on your own for that    But hope i helped =D|`|k1DEfrRKaa	ok, hun, part of dateing is being rejected. i know its sux cause you've never been rejected, but you have to dicide if shes worth it. whats more important, u prde...or this girl? and she might not even say no. but if i were u id try and get to know her first, talk to her when shes walkin down the halls, say hey to her at luch (dont just sit down beside her if shes with her friends, thats would look desperate, but try and get her to notive you) than if she isnt totaly ignoring you, ask her out|`|XDG9y8Aiaa	can i first say Physics rocks I took it for hsc and its awesome, and dont bag out nerds i'm a nerd and yes, ive been told im more than fairly attractive! and awesome!    talk to her, get to know her, then when your in the zone before friends, start with hinting towards going out sometime. don't get to the friend zone!! she may not want to hurt the friendship then. but watch out for other competetion, then you want to ask her before they do|`|lAm6TBS8aa	Hey bro, im in 11th grade also. Its actually funny because i had the same problem earlier in the year. This chik, which i never used to be interested in but in the same class, lost like 30 pounds over the summer and looks good now... the way i did was to simply ask what she was up to for the weekend on a Friday. And then tell her to come with u for dinner or something. "Lets go to this place tomorow." Dont do to much asking... girls like a confident man. And flirting never hirts.. do it when u get the chance. Tell me if this helps at all...    Peace out,  Sina.
Zgs4RncIaa	He called my a Psycho B*tch, but instead of it pissing me off, I LMAO so hard and ended up really like it.    He hit the nail on the head with that one!!!    So thats what I am and pretty much proud of it!|`|8PvqsOt8aa	I have been called a *** !@ $ many times, good for nothing, selfish bast!@  to name a few, I really lost count of the things that she has said, in 10 years I am numb to the pain anymore, worse of she does not think she does it, or has not done it in a long time.|`|c55O7jqXaa	he has never disrepected me and this is why we are in a long term relationship.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Can't remember.

ZZ1RbxuKaa	since he's your cousin i suggest don't go out with him and yes i think he does like you like let see (p.s answer all the quest. the best way you can) does he rarely turn his back to you, or he might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things those are good ones too. But if you need more tips go to the site in sources sorry if i didn't help|`|cflktD34aa	your cousin? dont even go there.  dito for the best friends ex|`|AGbusTqGaa	LOL I read that soooo wrong!!! I thought you said he was your cousin!!! Leave that one alone, you shouldn't date your friends ex bfs.
tCsFxh5Aaa	Think of the types of things he does around the house.  Can any of that be turned into a money maker?     A lot of 11 yr. old boys mow their lawn and can make money by asking other neighbors if they'd be willing to pay him to mow theirs.  Or maybe he weeds the yard, pulls weeds out of the cracks in the sidewalk; there might be neighbors willing to pay for that.  In the past, boys that age used to get newspaper routes and deliver newspapers on their bikes (or if the neighborhood wasn't so nice, with mom driving them around).      Or is there some passion that he has that he can turn into money?  Some kids that age are good at installing software and can put up flyers to get others to pay them to do it.  Or maybe he can fix up bikes and do that for others.  Or maybe he needs to find a passion first, so that he has something to turn into a money maker...|`|kjnoEcrNaa	Chores!DUH.Like ask your mom and tell her "Oh,I'll clear out the dish washer for a dollar."And try to be persuasive.Example: "Hey mom,you look tired.Do you need a rest?Of course you do!Sit down." Mom answers: "But honey,I have to buy groceries." You answer: "Say Mom.I have an idea.I'll buy  the groceries if you give me six dollars." See?You won't make a ton at once but,if you just do a little a day,or set up a deal;"I'll but the groceries for the entire week if you give me 30 dollars." Hope I helped.|`|r1fLDlhCaa	well, he cant really, unless he jsut wants to shovel driveways and what not...and that dosent work, he just has to wait three more years till he can legally work. i myself am waiting for july so that i can get a job...|`|XzLUA7ataa	Help elderly neighbors with lawn care, snow shoveling, running errands, grocery shopping, rake leaves, wash cars, take out the trash.  Get a newspaper route.  Offer to help someone with younger children to take them to the park or watch them while the parent gets a break.|`|5bea5b92613f998503999650d76207e1aa	Hi there  there is not much you can do at that age but when my son was 11 he would cut the grass and rake and in the winter he would shovel the snow and clean up garbage and keep the grounds clean so there is all I can offer you for him  good luck
TS9IdLOIaa	If you truly love him, long distance will not affect your love for him, it can work. Love conquers all ;) Long distance sometimes makes a relationship stronger. Text/mail him, phone him, send him a CD filled with songs that remind you of him, send him gifts etc. The number of things you can do are endless, good luck :)|`|XOGYslKlaa	It won't. Just call it quits.
TXeUeiPHaa	She probably was trying to be friendly bc of what you said. Maybe she does like you..but there is an issue with you being a lezbian bc it could happen that she isnt a bisexual.
EKaSqI5haa	I know that this can be very generalized but it is possible that he could like you, sometimes they'll tease you and stuff just to get your attention, and if you think that he sometimes looks at you in class that could be the case, or there are just some angry people out there,who just pick on others too feel better and more superior about themselves.  Whatever it is don't take it personally.|`|f7kjibf4aa	He is So digging you. Dont let it get to you though. Just ignore him and he will ask you out sooner or later|`|6PaGQaqKaa	There are some people just like that.

1LTrZbxwaa	If you become "sluttier" you'll have more fun. But just don't put it out for just anybody have some standards and when you meet a guy you like, you shouldn't be uptight.    If you keep your standards too high, the right guy may come along and you may scare him off.    I suggest finding something in between. Don't be a total prude like you are now, but don't be a total **** either who puts out for just anybody. Only do with the guys you really like.|`|2LwPUoOvaa	Become slutty, you might attract more guys at a drank party. If you choose this path, you become a ultimate low. Slutty girls don't have confidence in themselves so they feel like they need to show more skin to get a glance at. So stay the way you are and surely you'll meet someone made just for you:)|`|de98ae9f767cca0cbce05bd146ac0d7daa	no comprendo|`|27kYwa2laa	I say keep your standards high. If you become "sluttier" guys are going to like you for the wrong reasons. If you keep your standards high then you will attract the right guy and he will like you for the right reason.|`|frpCK0utaa	keep your standerds high, you deserve the best there is.|`|xbMLtXOuaa	You can go out with guys and not be slutty. It seems like you may be a little too judgemental, give some of these guys a chance and go out with them or just get to know them better. You might find out you like one of them.   You lose respect if you just start putting out, i would strongly recommend against that. You'll begin attracting the wrong kind of guys, unless that is what you want?
cSOpcKOWaa	That's a tough line she has drawn in the sand for you. She is trusting you. But at the same time she is abusing your friendship, by trusting you not to tell about a situation that could potentially put her in danger. I wouldn't go to her parents about it, I would instead confide in your fiance, maybe he will want to go with her to insure her safety. I met my husband on the net and I had my father go with me to the airport to pick him up. He is from Australia and I met him online and he came to the USA to meet me.  Not all bad comes from internet romance, we have been together since 2000 and are still completely in love. I would wonder why if the guy that she is talking to wouldn't meet her halfway in a mutual location. Tell your fiance, don't take a chance that he will never see his sister again, because that will kill your relationship.|`|dYuK4JPEaa	Bring it up!  Or at least suggest to her that, the guy come visit where ya'll are so everyone can get to know him and make sure hes not a weirdo!|`|dChRZDKBaa	I would ask her about it.....Get some details.. This doesn't sound too good... So maybe you should tell your fiance|`|uWOwz5rvaa	I would tell your fiance. She is 18 so legally her parents can not do anything to stop her, but they can always threaten her if she still lives under their roof. I will talk her into having the guy come out and visit her instead. But, def. talk to your fiance about it first.|`|zb6C2SMMaa	have u not seen all the cases about these girls gettin raped and murdered by these people online?!!? She may be 18 but that does not make any difference in this case. that girl is foolish for what she is doing and she ought to know better. when it comes to something like this that could be a matter of life and death u better say something because if you don't and something happens u will never forgive urself and there is nothing worse than waking up and going to bed with a guilt like that.|`|7ot3Rqgpaa	You definitely have to say something. God forbid something did happen. You would never forgive yourself, and neither would your fiancee. And yes legally she is an adult but she can't really be all that mature if she is willing to fly several states away to meet some guy that she found on the internet. Think of this way: If you say something, she'll be mad at you for a little while. If you don't and something happens you will be mad at yourself forever. I would go to your fiancee first and let him go to his parents if need be.|`|XlI2NLx4aa	HELL YEAH!!!! Don't be stupid! I know you heard of them gurls that ends up dead or in the hospital cause the guy they went to see was crazy! FOR HER LIFE TELL! She'll get mad cause you told but its for her protection! But you can do it like this have her contact the guy and see if he is willing to come where y'all live and and get a hotel and rent a car! If he say yes then he's a good guy, but if he say no then he only wants two things to have sex with her and take the money that she have from her! Talk to the guy and see where he's mind is at! Need to talk just e-mail ok!
LDe9yzCKaa	lol.. make him his fav dish for dinner and then play twister w/ nothing but socks ;)|`|A40jdi5Naa	have sex withhim..or ...her|`|oZsABHovaa	If ur a guy i would put a path of roses infront of the door so when she walks in she follows the path and then it leads to a room with a table set for 2 wine romantic food etc etc.... lol :P to bad if ur a girl cant think of anything|`|dVlLahozaa	strip for him, try new positions and show him a sexy time.|`|evW18jvIaa	Many places sells "sexy dice" that are fun...One die says a part of the body, and the other has a bedroom-related verb.    Since you're trying to save money, you might look at some classic ways to have fun, like buying a bottle or two or whipped cream. Put the cream on several parts of your body (guess which!) after you've blindfolded your husband. Make him start at your feet and work his way up, discovering all the treats! I guarantee that by the time he gets to the top, you'll be moving on to a different game! ;)
fUBWB88laa	My parents have a friend who married a mail order bride. She's awesome and VERY smart. I guess in her country if you are not married by the time you are around 28 years old, you are no longer desirable...so many women put themselves online to marry outside of the country. We asked her if she loved him...and she said "I will grow to love him." But they just had a baby together in 2008 and have a good life....they are happy. Hope that helps you out!|`|sGP6s7uraa	My uncle did.  Philipino woman.  That was 10 years ago and they are goin' strong.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	ha ha ha...yeah I do. First one he met in Ukraine had a daughter and the father wanted him to pay him money to sign the papers allowing him to adopt the girl even though the father never cared for the child her entire life.     Then the one he finally married disappeared after 1 month and showed up on month later when a car pulled up in front his house and she got out and the driver threw her suitcase at her before driving off.    Then in the news, a guy got a bride from Thailand and her family killed him and took his money and house after he changed his will.|`|b42321eaeffc09f9a05b30dcc0083009aa	One of my mom's male friends married a mail order bride from Russia. He was in his late 40's and had never found "the one." She was in her late 20's, early 30's. They talked online and over the phone for over a year and met twice. He had to spend a considerable amount of money to get her here. After she got here, they had a child very soon and that made them both extremely happy, all he ever wanted was a wife and kids. There were some language problems (she had a very thick accent) and she became very very lonely. He worked to support the family, and she was alone during the day and didn't have any friends. She moved her mother out to live with them for the summer and it caused a lot of problems in the marriage. After a month of her mother being there, the wife decided that she wanted to move home. They started having problems in their marriage, and last I heard they were doing a trial separation. I believe they were together around 3 years?    Now, I'm sure that not all mail order bride stories turn out the same, but that is the only one I know.    Also, how many "normal" marriages go through the same ups and downs? So, you can't really contribute the problems to her being a mail order bride. And no matter how it ended up, I think that they really did love each other. They at least made the effort to really get to know eachother before they got married...|`|AA11394840	I am a mail order bride married to an American since 1984.It takes a while before we get adjusted to what we want in our marriage. But I think it takes chances and guts to move from what you are accustom to.    Regarding the motives, it all varies, depends on the situation the girl is in back where she came from. If she is below average in life, of course, she wanted to upgrade her status, she can pick any one who will offer her what she wanted in life. If she was hurt or bored with her own race, she will try to connect with others that she might prefer to be her partner in life who will cherish and loved her. If she is rich, she wanted excitement and adventure since its one hell of a ride receiving mail, email, picture, souvenir, gift, cards and among other things.    About the lead and information, I am not sure if the one that I got involved with is still on going.You can try to get in touch with Cherry Blossoms for the guys and Rainbow Ridge for the girls. If you are a girl, all you do is send your picture and bio-data, free of charge. If you are a guy, you will receive a magazine but you need to pay to get the name and address of the chosen one.    Good luck...

3Rr5SAhhaa	Seeing as it is your mom's second marriage, it doesn't have to be a big affair. You can make it a small luncheon at your ( your mom's) house, given that there is enough room. Maybe just finger sandwhiches, small appetizers, etc, and close family and friends. The shower is usually given about a month or two before the actual wedding.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  You are being a really nice daughter, but a shower is definitely NOT NEEDED.  To be honest, not only is it not needed, it would be viewed as very "tacky" (I know I hate that word, but it applies here) to have one.    I mean, she was married for 27 years.  She doesn't need any household stuff (towels, sheets, etc.)    Maybe just take her out to lunch with your aunt and grandmother.  That's all I would do.|`|AA10975867	A daughter does not hold a shower for her mother just as a mother does not throw a shower for her daughter. A woman who was married for that long and has a daughter in college does NOT have a "bridal shower". So tacky. I hope your mother knows what she's doing - married for 27 years and then jumping right in less than a year of being unmarried? Oh well! Her galpals her own age should be taking her out to a nice lunch a week or so before the wedding, perhaps bring her gifts of lingerie or bath products or champagne - or they could take her out on the town one evening but definitely no cutesy "showers"! You are off the hook, hon!|`|sGP6s7uraa	I don't think your mother should get a bridal shower.  Bachelorette party? Yes.  Bridal shower?

7MkTM1jQaa	You seem to have answered your own question with "we really want to be married somehow" :) If you you really do want to just get married you can have a wonderful intimate marriage ceremony, just a small little thing just so that you guys can be married and begin your married life together. And I know every girl has her own dream for her wedding day, so what you can do is save up money and on your first anniversary you can have a vow renewal and throw that big reception party that you want. OR Have a big anniversary party. This way, you can have both, a wedding now, and sill have your dream of a big party! In any case, good luck and congrats!    Cheers!  Silver|`|9quzOxZbaa	Do a very small wedding & cut all the BS out...don't do a rehearsal dinner...use that money for the wedding caterer...do it BYOB...just provide tea & sodas...let your friends all know that it is tight, but you want them there to celebrate your union...they will pitch in...don't get a band or DJ, use an IPOD full of songs for the wedding...and go simple with the decorations...you can find lots of ideas that are inexpensive and nice.  You could probably swing 50-75 people on a very tight budget.  You just have to make it a more casual wedding...if you try to make it elegent on a small budget, it may look cheap.  If you go a bit more casual...you can pretty much pull it off...  check out offbeatbride.com they have some alternative ideas for things...or look at a wedding magazine...I see clear vase centerpieces just full of lemons and limes all the time...very cheap to do.  Cut down on flowers too- by axing the boutineers & do a very simple bouquet for you and the girls...you can even probably do it yourself.    Just some thoughts.    OR go to the JP.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I say just do it now. With the economy being as bad as it is and possibly only getting worse might as well do it right now.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Have the smaller wedding.

Congrats and be happy about getting married.|`|nqINitkmaa	I think that you should have a small wedding, you guys are starting out and have a baby to think of. Save the money. Besides it is considered poor taste when a couple has a huge wedding when they have already been living together and have a child.( I am not judging, that's just wedding etiquette) A small wedding would be good, and more affordable, if you can't afford a big wedding now, then the responsible thing to do is have a small wedding.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	only you can decide what is more important - being married to the man you love and saving a great deal of money by having a small intimate ceremony or waiting and spending huge amounts of money entertaining and feeding 100-130 people?    personally i would do the small wedding and use the extra money for your home, your honeymoon, your daughter.    big weddings = big headaches + spending a ton of money!    go get married now and have it done with sweetie! happy wedding!|`|3OeE8kMQaa	I suggest getting married in a small and intimate setting.

Zi09MYajaa	im 28, and can tell you from my experience, and it was a 4 year experience, it was the worst relationship, i could ever have been in, we had a child together also, so it was made worse by that. We split 2 years ago, and can say we both have new relationship, and get on better than we ever did, he see"s our son weekly, and helps me and my partner anyway he can.    love/hate relationships end up destructive, and you end up feeling more times sad that happy in a relation ship of this kind, this is the sort of relationship where morals dont happy, for example, you will say the most horrid nasty even evil things to each other, that you would never dream of saying to another human being.This sort of relationship has no boundries or each side, maybe not in the beginning, but towards the end. There was nothing i wouldnt stoop to, to hurt my ex, and vise versa. It was one of the most stressful things ive ever been through, so much so i moved 300 miles to get away from it, after 2 years i returned, and even then we argued for sometime, before we finally called a truce|`|DRuLCmIVaa	I hate to say it, but my husband and I have a love/hate relationship. We fight a lot (not in front of our daughter) and love a lot too. We both have strong personalities. I think we've been going strong because at the end of the day, we make each other laugh. I think laughter holds us together. You have to laugh! Its just as important as intercourse. We've been married under 5 years, but we both couldn't see ourselves with anyone else. We've talked about divorce a few times, but we're still together. And we've actually committed ourselves to each other again. Why? Because we have a daughter and want more kids. And plus we do love each other. I hope this helps.|`|BMhPpnuMaa	its been done      sid and nancy    they both dead now tho....|`|0v1kT2Zfaa	well i can tell you that in my expreence it didnt work i was with my husband for 8 years was defently a love/hate relationship couldnt go one day without a blazing row couldnt stand the sight of each other most of the time although we could never stay apart for more than a month.no one could undertand why we were together was a case of cant be with each other but cant be apart. had to come to an end at some point though couldnt carry on living like that and i am much happier now that im away from that situation. so in my case it didnt work but thatss not to say others wont

What if this is her BEST behavior?  You think divorcing her is going to be easier than breaking an engagement?  You may want to re-think it.    You honestly need to end the relationship.  If she feels the need to "sue" you for the list of stuff you "owe" her, then let her take you to small claims court. You have plenty of time to come up with a response in case she does.    I"d tell her WHY you're breaking the engagement.  Tell her that you are not going to marry someone who doesn't trust you, who attacks your self-esteem, and who says disparaging things about single parents when they know you were raised by one.  Tell her she needs to find someone who is as perfect as she is, because you realize you will never be able to achieve her standards of perfection, and you see no point in even trying.      To quote the girl in "Forest Gump".....RUN FOREST, RUN!!!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	the real problems will come after u marry her, its never too late before u get married to change your mind, or get to know her better. u are a free man and can do whatever u like.if u don't feel comfortable now, marriage will only make things worse for u. most people don't show their true selves until after they get their hooks into u, but what u are seeing is a glimpse into your future.|`|egpVC6uMaa	If you marry her, your life will be more of a living hell than you imagine. Either get out now...or be meserable for a long time. You are not married yet...why put yourself through that?    Good Luck.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	She cannot make you pay for things that were used/broken throughout the relationship.  She's a retard.    Tell her to take a hike.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Can you say Pyscho. If you don't break it off now things wil only get worse in the future. You don't owe her anything and she can't get anything from you unless you are married.     DO NOT GET MARRIED unless you want to suffer.|`|pSy88C9paa	you need to get out and not look back.  dont walk, RUN.  life is too short and you will feel much better.   I would take some time before getting into another relationship to see  what made you pick this kind of woman so you dont repeat that.  best of luck to you  and kudos for being a single parent  it isnt easy.|`|dVlLahozaa	Tell her that you need a break and then see where things go from there it also sound like your self esteem is low and that she is an abuser get some help men also deserve to receive the same help as women do. Leave her and move on.|`|vnYCmvHNaa	break it off...i know it will hurt but if you dont now then both of you may end up regretting it and missing out on wonderful opportunities GOOD LUCK!!!|`|vybENqmuaa	If you are feeling like this now then i think that's a sign. Honeslty if she is doubting you now, what makes you think that just cus you all get married she will stop and be more loving? Engaged couples are suppose to be happy, and excited to swear before god till death do us part... If she accuses you of things you will owe her...just say you better have recepits. Dont let her run your life or threaten you in any way. Maybe if you sit down and talk to her and let her no you are thinking of getting calling everything off for the way they are going she can open her eyes and realize the things she is doing is hurting you.?|`|082f5b8608ba73f94740f8d0d032d26aaa	Sadly, it is time to end this bad relationship. It will be hell for you  if you go ahead with the marriage.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Yes it is time to end it.  She can make you give her anything.  You were not in a long term marriage.  Tell her she can cut her losses the same as you.  Don't let her keep bullying you.  correction:  she CAN"T  make you give her anything.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Your afraid to break up with her because she'll make your life a living hell? Sounds like it already is. And what do you think it will be like if you marry her? What if you have kids?  She's abusive and nuts, get away from her.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Put the marriage on hold for now and both of you take time to see what really is going on.|`|RKFrkgCGaa	Don't let her emotionally blackmail you into sticking around.  The fact that you are afraid of her wrath, not of missing her, if you break up tells you all you need to know - get out now!  If you were a woman and she were a man everyone would be here telling you that you are with an abuser. Women are more likely to get away with it, but abuse is abuse.  Get out and try to move on with your life.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	if you dont wanna break up w/ her... put ur marriage on hold... but dont marry her if she down talks you and makes you feel like crap. there is no point of getting into something like that. & she wants you to pay her back for things? thats so damn wrong... i mean what about all the dinners you paid for and all the roses and stuff... make sure that when she throws a list at your face when you decide to break up (which i honestly believe it is the right time to do so), that your list is much longer... much, much, much longer ;) best wishes|`|k73IxCHaaa	You should be able to answer your own question. Simply stated, is this really the women that you want to spend the rest of your life with, I mean really. There are plenty and I mean plenty of good women out there and you're dealing with this castrating control freak, grow a couple my friend.     As someone has already said "life is too short". Marriage is tough enough as it is when you have a good partner, but you want to start yours with this women. Just remember short term pain, long term gain. You'll  thank yourself a year or two from now.|`|vFCva8R5aa	if you marry her it will only get worse|`|veZLfnGFaa	Oh, no, your life is a living hell right now.  Think about how it's gonna be 10 years from now if you marry her.  Get out now while you still can and don't worry about what you owe her.  Tell her to take you to court. Good Luck :)|`|q8lFhmE8aa	DO NOT MARRY THIS WOMAN!!!    Hopefully you didn't make the mistake of moving in with her also. If you did, then you might have to get lawyers involved when you break up with her to divide your property, etc. If you didn't move in with her, then you owe her nothing unless she loaned you money.    Of course, you might be better off just giving her the money for the stuff on her list and getting it over with.
pSy88C9paa	yes, if you are married, he will be presumed as the father.  and in the courts eyes he is unless you do paternity to prove he is not.  PS they will not grant your divorce while you are pregnant.  they will wait til the baby is born to establish custody and child supprt as part of the divorce.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	you dont have to be married to have the fathers name on the birth certificate... but make sure you put the biological fathers name... not the mom's husbad but the baby daddy ;)|`|nZXJrAAjaa	It will be under your husband's name because you were both legally married and also the court will have to wait after you gave birth so that child custody will be given to the baby.      According to this article that Child Custody laws describe the responsibility of guardianship over a child. In cases of divorce where children are involved, a court must rule on a child custodial arrangement as one of the terms of the divorce. Divorcing parents are free to reach agreement on an acceptable custody arrangement, however, in the minority of cases where parents dispute some aspect of the custody arrangements, the court will examine the family, the child, and the qualities or misdemeanors of either parent, before delivering a legally binding judgment intended to put the well-being of the child first. It is usually far preferable to reach a settlement outside of court, putting less strain on affected children, and being cheaper for the parents to avoid litigation.|`|AA12322129	If your husband is the father of the child then yes the father's last name will be on the birth cirtificate.  If the husband is not the child's father then you better put the real father's name on it.|`|dWLGK7nlaa	who is the father???|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	The birth certificate should have the childs Fathers name on it regardless if you were married or not.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You can have whatever name you darn well please on that birth certificate.|`|dVlLahozaa	Yes because you guys are legally married|`|t5m73eE8aa	My wife is From NC and she separated from her husband got pregnant like 3 years later and still was married she didn't have the funds for the divorce because of that the biological dad isn't on the birth certificate it says "refused" but she has my wife's last name you can name a child anything you want. but the biological dad can't be on it since your still married. but she has the divorce and the biological dad doesn't want anything to do with our daughter that's right our daughter i am adopting her i will be put on the birth certificate and her last name will be mine
KSUksBZkaa	that's just the way girls are. it didn't necessarily mean anything. women are caregivers by nature so when we want to show someone that we care [even if it's just as a friend]  and that we are there for them, we will give support physically like a hug or a rub on the back etc. if this is the only thing you have to go by, i wouldn't read too much into it if i were you even more so cuz she has a bf.|`|b7r3pmp8aa	I'm thinking the reason she almost cried and grabbed your hand was because she may have felt horrible for ignoring you back then, that's what it sounds like|`|EanVzQBQaa	I don't get it.|`|v2D4Sao5aa	she feels your pain maybe she was fat 2 and no dont get 2 exited she doesnt like you........helllooooo she has a bf ..but if you want to ask her go ahead but she doesnt like you|`|Ex7hYU0laa	Maybe it means she felt a little bad for you and may start to like you just a little..|`|dc460f6168bc2ee3d4ab9b2e847777e0aa	she's happy for you and maybe harbored a little crush on you?|`|TXeUeiPHaa	she either  a) liked you while having a bf  b) Felt bad for you  c) dont know
EanVzQBQaa	Just don't be too pushy, take it slow.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	If she agreed to the date she probably sees a little more than a friend in you. So, don't worry too much about the friend thing. Just be yourself and flirt a little with her.     I wouldn't bring her flowers. I think it's a little too much too soon. Talking her to a nice restaurant will be just fine.     See how the date goes and how she responds. If she wants to come to your house fine... but it will probably lead to sex and she may not be comfortable with it yet. See how the date goes and take it from there. Good luck.|`|v2D4Sao5aa	umm this is what you should do well if its your best friedns you guys are always joking around and she feels weird b/c well your her best friend and if you want  to tlak this serouis tell her how you feel about her!!!that would work trust me|`|XZHx3v4Raa	movie is nice.don't go to your house there could be embarssing stuff in every corner
LrWIu1N0aa	to be honest i think you have done everything you really  could have. my only advice would be just dont contact her, no matter how long it takes. i know its hard and upsetting but if she was a real friend and cared she will get intouch with you. if not, your better of without her|`|RKFrkgCGaa	She sounds like a really selfish person, like she is willing to maintain the friendship as long as it is completely on her grounds and you have to do all the work.  That is not a friendship, that is a person with a fan club following them around.  And who wouldn't like it?  Spend your time preparing for the Navy and thinking about all of the lifelong bonds you are going to make there, with people who want to give as much as they get.  Good luck!|`|b4NcFBhraa	people grow apart that's all I can say. Maybe make a new friend and start NON-STOP talking about him/her and then she'll want YOU back. Change the way you talk or dress. IF she means that much to you then tell her. Tell her that you feel that she's not being a friend and that You'd like to know what's REALLY going on behind that poker face. Tell her this isn't a game, she doesn't need to hide any tricks.|`|SxsXnvwiaa	I think you should just stop trying, and if she's a real friend she'll start putting more into your guys' friendship.
ZZ1RbxuKaa	don't worry high school isn't like those movies trust me that's what my bro thought and he got a massive reality check! and don't worry there's nothing wrong with you if you can't play sports there are other things to do like art, band, chess club (hey don't be a hater!! some chess guys and girls can be pretty cute) and lots lots more. and be happy that you got lots of friends and even a lot of close ones too. p.s your doing great don't stress!! ;D oh and if you feel as if some friends aint that good then either get closer to them or just let them get there own space it doesnt effect you life!! Good luck with the rest of your life!!trust me you got alot ahead of you i may not be older than you  but i have A LOT of family members!!  XD if you choose not to follow my advice then don't i don't mind as long as i helped in a tiny way.;)|`|cflktD34aa	you think 20 to 30 friends isn't enough. weird. I have about half that and im in my last year of highschool and perfectly happy with what and who im with.|`|v2D4Sao5aa	you have to get out there meet new ppl not just the same friends you have i mean in your home rooms there alot of ppl and the one tht you odnt like you could get to know and thts how you could make new friends:) its not tht your boring so dont feel bad high school ots tough i know
evW18jvIaa	You're definitely right.    I just got an HIV test at my annual gyno exam, and I've been in an affair-free relationship with my now husband for over 2 1/2 years.     It wasn't "Oh he cheated!", but rather that my doctor advised the test since he had had sex with women before he and I got together. She said that HIV can lay dormant for up to 10 years! Let her know that it's just a health precaution!|`|BC2CNH3jaa	She's being unreasonable. This is not about trust, it's about health and perhaps making a baby. Tell her I said so, and I know everything.|`|k73IxCHaaa	Simply stated, I think it is a mature and responsible request as long as both of you are going to be tested.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	shes blowing this out of proportion... its a good thing if the two of you go and get tested... better safe than sorry... and as for the preg test... normal girls would be worried and would want to clear up the matter asap.. i think|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Your both being silly..If you were both mature enough you would of been down there taking the test already and not sitting around arguing about it.|`|RKFrkgCGaa	You are being responsible, not untrusting.  It is a fact that unless she is a virgin then she could be infected, as could you.  You are doing this for both of you.  It's not a "dirty" thing or something that only sluts get, it is a deadly reality.  Stand your ground.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	shes offended you asked her|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	You're supposed to have all the testing done BEFORE you sleep with someone.    However if she has nothing to hide then she shouldn't have a problem with it. you are just protecting yourself and her.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	If I were you, I'd be curious as to why she is really upset. I smell an immature rat. Perhaps find a woman who has the ability to think.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Well you're right about it not being about trust but she also may be right about it being too late.  You should have had this done before.  I'd wonder, though, why she was getting upset about it and not also wanting to protect herself.|`|OCxXjSxAaa	either test or find someone else|`|EzZk2pyNaa	She's mad, because she thinks you don't trust her. I can see why she would get mad if you just suddenly asked her after you've already had sex twice. But at the same time, I don't see anything wrong with complying.|`|zIXReHyTaa	Her reaction says that she is scared that she may have a positive test on either HIV or Pregnancy.  Too late now but the time to ask was before you had sex and even then you can't trust someone 100 % as quick as 1 month so you are right to get tested together.  I would also get tests for chlamydia and other sexual diseases done too - her reaction tells me that she has been sleeping around a lot and maybe you have too.  However - the pregnancy test is up to her - your own fault for not using a condom - but this is her body and her decision when or if to test not yours.  You trusted each other too soon - you both needed to talk about previous partners, what protection you used and if either of you have had any sexual diseases in the past.  You can't trust someone if you don't know everything about them - full stop.|`|baI5G8yLaa	Totally understand the pregnancy test but seriously the HIV test??    Here in the UK nothing is ever done like that, dont get me wrong we all have sexual health checks but its not somthing that i would even ask and i was be extremly upset if someone asked me that!    But at the same time i can understand why you would want to be safe but you should of thought of that be for you slept with her!|`|dVlLahozaa	Does she have anything to hide at this point ? That is what you should be asking yourself it sounds like maybe she wants to get pregnant or that she has had unprotected sex with others.|`|t5m73eE8aa	well sometimes its not to late there has been cases that ppl had sex together and one was HIV positive but didn't transfer it crazy yes i know but it happens if she isn't willing to do so then dump her find another
cJEP35wuaa	From what i can tell i think she thinks you dont notice her "that" way and she wants to no if she "cured" or "fixed" and now you c her. "Am i real now?" just means do you notice me?  If she talks about your face, shes saying your cute, or shes saying your your eyes numb her (a good thing for a girl :)    "Commited and aquited" means shes commnited to getting you to love her  Am i winner now? Did  i win your heart ( ithink )  Not a question on why or when but but where, means now she wants to get toghter now !    Am i fake now? Means she thinks you used to notice her and now well you just flat out dont!    Light flikcering usally means your brain, so it means that she thinks abut you throught the everything?  Broken heart  duh!  The peices are perminant, well shes giving up?  No more luv and hate ? its over  And a note that read no and it sis and it is and it isnt   that means you change all the time maybe thats what luv and hate means also  Am i cured now?  Do you notice me, Do you like me?    Good-Luck with this  Uhh... shes a very good poest|`|AATEMuWgaa	in love?|`|zqiOlo3caa	It means she's mentally unstable haha|`|h6wDmUMWaa	i think she loves you. ask her out if u like her badways!|`|lTDWrM6haa	is she ur girl? do u think she likes u? or just some random girl?|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	omg lol!Kind of creepy!|`|z0x07ATraa	its looks to me like....she liked you but never told you and you somehow hurt her bykissing or hugging another girl and shes trying to get over you but she cant and she felt like she had to do something  ?|`|eT6SsCaraa	It sounds like she likes you, and according to her, she thinks you can help her. 'Am I cured now?' is like if she's asking you if you want to be together. 'And a note that read no' Maybe she was regected before..?    She has a lack of self esteem or confidence. Maybe she is having a hard time in her life too. There's a lot you can get from this poem if you look, but I think that should do. Try to get to know her? ;D|`|9EQpQhkzaa	in the first part she is trying to say that she is searching for someone but she is not noticed.in the second part she is saying that you or someone else made her laugh, cry, feel shunned and if she is insane.in the third part she is saying that she went for love and never game up.is she a winner for this?in the fourth part she is saying how, why, or when and where did she take herself this far in her journey.she also is saying is she dumb for doing this? in the last part she is saying her heart has been broken too much and can not be repaired.she doesn't understand why she did not get any attention back for her action.this is what i got from her message too you.|`|ZOzaX00Baa	The first verse is questioning is she real? she's confused and hence the "bye not bye hello" and wants to be found by someone (you maybe?) but is not found and doesn't feel real ( to you or someone)    The second verse talks about what she may have gone through in relationships she's had (or just one relationship she is having atm or had) how she had different emotions- cried laughed shunned. she wonders if its normal or is she going insane?    The 3rd verse she explains how she was never a quiter and how she went through different relationships- commited, full with love, "bitter" being hurt in a relationship so she speaks am i winner? the fact she's managed to get through these different relationships means is she a winner?    The 4th verse being about where love is found- passionate love can be erotic and exciting but hate is attractive (bad boy attitude), so is she fake for liking what others do?    the last verse is about how her heart has been damaged from so many painful relationships and experiences that she has no more hate, no more love she feels numb and feels like she has noone. she lastly asks am i cured now? as if to say she doesn't feel anything anymore so is that the cure to a broken heart?      ALSO This could be about different stages in a relationship not lots of relationships    hope this helps!|`|ebOmvMGfaa	It sounds like she is saying that she liked you..but never said anything. that she tried to tell you but couldn't bring herself to tell you straight up, and only did little things to try to show you....  and that something happened with either you or her that broke her heart..  and in the end she is saying that her heart can't be fixed after what happened, and that nothing can ever happen between the two of you. that she has accepted that mostly and she is wondering if she is cured now. if she is over you.  that's what i think it means|`|EanVzQBQaa	Wow.   Um are you friends with this girl?  It kind of confuses me.  Maybe talk to the girl who wrote it.  I'm sorry.  Good Luck!    PS= I said sorry cuz i didn't help much.|`|Ex7hYU0laa	I think she may havea crush on you, but thiks you like someone else?

I0GqKJ0aaa	Because the finally have freedom. After this, they're not gonna be able to have one night stands as much and feel forced to settle down. Also remember not to lower yourself to their "standards" of looking like a whore. Guys will most likely want to get to know you more if you're intelligent, beautiful and loving. I know how you feel and it disgusts me that guys are like that. Just don't hang out with a ton of party guys, choose ones that smoke weed they're pretty awesome and fun to chill with :)|`|RWsTvypoaa	Try to go for an older guy, like a junior.

Usually you wont find the good-guys at parties. Maybe sometimes (because you don't want them to be hermits or anything). But college is normally the time guys just wanna party and have fun. Get yourself involved in something you enjoy, and maybe find a guy there. Or wait until your done college, try and have fun yourself (but don't be those slutty fake girls). Just go out and be you and be real...and eventually they will realize their missing something. To me it just sounds like your view is just on the assholes, there are some nice guys out there. Just sometimes it take being friends with them for a long time first before the attraction.|`|K4emL77jaa	not all are  after all i am in 11th grade and dating a guy who is in his second year of college  he rocks  i love him  so not all are like that you just have to know where to look  :]|`|1e7578235af87deb4913ad0e4c75db44aa	the nice guys are the guys that are respectful to the girls. were the ones that act gentleman manner.|`|ql4EgAL3aa	they are truely douchebags. there must be some nice guys somewhere on your campus don't give up. they just like the slutty fake girls because they are easy and at this point in their lives they don't seek meaningful relationships. they are tools who need alot of time to grow up.|`|D27rM7auaa	you make sure you stayaway from them girl, just make sure you dont get mixed up in that crowd.

yMuCMQk9aa	The easiest thing to do is get your friends in on it : D  just ask them to see if he acts differently when your around to when your not, and if they cant figure it out just get one of them to straight out ask him. Remember, he could be denying it anyway.  & Also remember, even if he doesnt now, if the prospect of being with you comes up, he may decide he does (:      good luck|`|WW17IVJCaa	ask...or ask someone to ask him if your nervous...lol|`|FdxSfqB6aa	ask, there is nothing wrong with asking

Take her up on that movie offer:]|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Sounds like you will become her booty call. If she is kissing you in a sensual way and yall haven't even been on a date, she's just going to use you.

Take her up on the offer to see a movie, you might get a good relationship out of it.|`|64yuBBXpaa	Okay, if she KISSES YOU ON THE LIPS she obviously likes you!!!

Start with a movie and see where it goes.  Maybe she just thinks of you as a friends who she can be affectionate with and have fun being around and will become your good friend and introduce you to a great girlfriend of hers.

baI5G8yLaa	I Was in the same position and it took agessss for her to get out of my life! unfortunatly he saw her everyday too but not by choice just becase she actaully worked at the same place, It is hard but if he has actually said he still loves her then honestly truely you need to dump him you dont deserve to be second best you deserve to be FIRST! AND ONLY FIRST,    Honey you could do so much better  Have some fun xx|`|i2V17yi4aa	just end it...tell it how it is girl he hasnt made up his mind then dont waiste your time on him ... even if you continue this relationship you dont want to marry this guy and him still thinking about his ex... its a waiste of your time girl. just tell him how you feel and tell him you want out. if he tryes to stay tog. tell him he cannot see/talk to  his ex anymore. but you know in your heart that he will think about her. so dont waiste your time find someone who will care about you and only you|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Anyone who actually says there still in love with there ex isn't even worth being with!!

ue8voZW9aa	Ignore him, just never reply to his messages and just put on facebook that you are in relationship with one of your guy friends, haha that's what I did, I just found one of my guy friends and was like hey do you want to be married to me over facebook as a joke and they were like yeah. So that ticked off my ex even thought that wasn't the object of doing it but either way just forget about him and just move on to other guys and Never and I mean NEVER reply to his "updates!" lol Good Luck I can already tell your much more mature then he is =)|`|64yuBBXpaa	I think it seems like it because he is :P  I'm so sorry :(  You don't need jerks like that though!|`|AA12059817	First off..he still loves you (that's why he can't let go), he's trying to hurt you..You must have hurt him in some way-I think he's retaliating.
da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Hon, basically if you stay with him, you're always gonna be his prisoner.  That's what you described your life as.  He has absolutely no trust in you and that's not fair to you.  You deserve so much better than what he's giving you.  I'd have a serious talk with him about what he's doing to you and tell him that you want your freedom to get a job and freedom to at least GO HOME after work instead of being prisoner in his shop or having to constantly be "babysat" by him so he can keep his eye on you.... Like I said, you at least deserve that.  You are NOT his prisoner.  If he can't give you that, then I'd get out.    EDIT:  Okay so you've seen that when he changes for the better, he DOES change back for the worse then so you know it's never going to get better.  And you have family somewhere so maybe they can help you get away.  You have a car.  I imagine he takes that to work so that may not be an option to use to get away.  Take a bus if you have to.  Get someone to drive you to the airport if your family is that far but just remember, he's manipulated you into thinking things were going to be better in the past and they didn't.... so he'll keep dragging you down right along with him and you don't deserve this.  You really don't.  For your own sanity and your own safety, please get out of there as soon as you can.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Sounds like you know what you want...    "but i think that if he really loved me, he wouldn't bring up the past and try and move on. He has told me that it will never change. He can't change the way his mind works. I have mentioned counseling, and he just says no."|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Why have you put up with this?  Do you hate yourself?

I really think you need to talk to a professional about this--not a couples counselor, this is too much of a disaster to be fixed--but a counselor for yourself to figure out why you did this to yourself.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	WOW this doesnt sound like a very good enviroment to be in.  I answer a lot of difficult questions but this one is really bad.    There is definately something funny going on with your partner.  To me I dont think its counselling thats needed but rather some mental health.    This dude really has some deep issues.  You do sound like you do love him so I wont tell you to give up on him.  But I think you do need to be careful and try and get him some help.    The site below has some great relationship articles.  You might want to have a read.|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Ok.. first off let me just say that I am also 23 years old and I am very happily married, but if he was my bf and treated me like that I would have been gone long ago!!! He sounds bi-polar or something obviously there's something wrong in that brain of his!!! It's your choice but here's my opinions and stuff I think you should leave..he's not gonna change!! He's manipulated you to thinking that your life is great with him and you can't live without him!! Well, sorry to rain on his parade but you are your own person and have the right to do what you want when you want to!! With 5 kids and 2 ex wives??? Why ex wives probably because he was with them did the same thing to them then after the kids they couldn't put up with him and left his ***  I say leave when he's at work take the car and go!! Call a family member and let them know!! If he comes after you get a restraining order!! You don't deserve this from any guy and the reason I say guy because he ain't no MAN!!! It takes more than what he's doing to be a man..right now he's acting like a little boy he needs to run back home to his mommy!! I wish you luck be strong don't give in..you'll be much happier and find a wonderful man who will love you trust you and respect you for exactly what you are!! Good luck|`|c55O7jqXaa	He gave you your answer by saying- He can't and is not willin to change. Leave. Leave because you are too young to have to care for him and his 5 offspring, he is abusive in his words, he is not willing to work on the marriage, he is being very immature. My Goodness 5 kids- how old is this man?|`|yy45iAbtaa	i would just leave the man is insecure and will never forgive you your marriage to him is a disaster.i would leave if i was you and know he has to pay child support for 5 children you will never have a happy future with this man ever take your losses and move on find someone who does not through your past in your face you truly deserve better than what you are getting he will never get over the relationship you had while you were separated pack your bags and move on why would you put up with it so long that is my question get out while you are still young.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	regroup, look at your life and what is happening..get into some kind of counseling and get moving forward
KSUksBZkaa	tell him to quit acting like a little pansy [due to not being able to use the word i really want to use because i'm on Y!A lol] maybe you should hit him also...that would shut him up real quick. you need to find a new best friend.|`|zb6C2SMMaa	ok ur friend really admires u and u seem to be a big influence on him. He is just full of himself right now cuz he found a new hobby. do u support him at all? he is probably sayin he is betta and all that cuz he is lookin for a compliment or some support out of u. he sounds like he is being an asshole right now but give it time he will get over it he is goin thru a fase. i have 40 cousins and know them all better than anyone else does so trust my advice. It also might be because he really knows he don't sing or play good and he is jsut doing that to ease his self concious. u know kinda like he was jealous of u|`|sDmRH7rAaa	o.k. I had a bff like that once and She made me cry like that! An u k wyt? BEST FRIENDS DONT MAKE BEST FRIENDS CRY! So u go up to that boy...and say..."Fool, i aint gonna put up with your crap no more!"

Just don't express your feeling for the guy you like in front of the first guy.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	1. i think you should be distant friends with james... just pretend it never happened. which is hard to do so: talk to james about it.. it may be hard at first but youll pull thru and in the end it will be worth it.  2. you should go for who you like. dont let neone stop you! just think about who you like and it should make you feel a lot better.

elSUVcaZaa	I don't think that you are wrong in your feelings. i do, however, think that your relationship will always cause you pain until you fix your partner. He is dictating a situation that is only for his benefit. he doesn't seem to consider your feelings, nor, from what I'm reading, does he make any effort to please you.   relationships in this situation, where one partner behaves in a manner that the other finds disagreeable have three options: 1) you can learn toaccommodatee hisbehaviorr, living only for him, and forget your own worth. 2) you can challenge hisbehaviorr, telling him that you no longer accept living this way, and that you need change in the relationship. 3) leave him. (I'm sorry if I sound blunt but those are the real options. choose for yourself, not for anyone else!) Good luck. x|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	I know exactly what you're going through. My husband, a couple years ago, was working two full time jobs, one day and one night, i slept alone almost every night also and the nights he had off if he wasnt dead tired and sleeping, hed be going to bars or to his friends and i felt like "what about us?" but because I was hurting so much, whenever he did try to be a close to me, i pushed him away because it wasnt enough for me. Even after he lost one of his jobs we still couldnt get along. But odd as it sounds, what really helps our relationship is having sex as often as we can, 4-7x a week, and no one wants to be angry after sex, and we both feel wanted and get the attention we need. and we both feel closer to each other. Maybe you should try, whats the worst that could happen?|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	It's obvious that you are not happy with your situation or you wouldn't be asking questions you already know the answer to!  What is it you would tell your best friend if she was telling you this exact same weird story?  Only you know what is in your best interest.  Put up with it or don't. (really there isn't anything to figure out).|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	If it weren't for him going out to clubs and that bothering you, then I would have just said that you guys are doing what has to be done to support your family. BUT, I just don't agree with a married man going out to clubs without his wife. I guess I am old fashioned that way. It sounds like maybe he does have a job that requires that, bartender or club owner? If so, then that is what you married into and he may not have any other ways to support the family. But back to your feelings. I think you are right to feel that something is wrong or missing. Have you really talked to him about this? I have a boyfriend that occassionally works nights and while we sleep in the same bed, I have felt sad when he didn't want to come to bed because he wasn't tired at the same time I am. What does he think about the situation? Sorry if I am not more helpful, but essentially, I don't think you are wrong. Your feelings are understandable.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	I feel for you. This may be a misunderstanding of your situation but it seems as if the two of you are staying in the marriage for the child's benefit and nothing more. You have every right to feel depressed. You really need to have an honest conversation with him and ask him directly "what exactly am I to you, other than the mother of your child?" Know that you deserve to be far more than simply a place-holder while he shops around for another woman. The prospect of divorce is frightening but it seems as though he has already given up on the marriage. Suggest marriage counseling to him. See if he is receptive. If he is, clearly he wants to salvage the relationship. If he refuses to try, you have to prepare yourself for the eventuality that a divorce is imminent. I wish you all of the best.|`|5d54c930f76191fdc32d96f07686e616aa	If I were you, I would feel very neglected.  However, not really knowing your situation more thoroughly, it is hard to say.  I would definitely be offended about the 'going out to clubs to be "seen".  That is preposterous!  Absolutely ridiculous!  You should be aware that his behavior is as though he wants to be separate from you and your child.  It doesn't seem like he wants to be around when he should be and therefore you should seriously consider getting counseling to figure out whether or not there are deeper issues to be dealt with here.
92NjLGQyaa	First and foremost you need to cut the ties that bind you with him.....If in fact he is physically abusing you the next order of business is to file for a restraining order against him right away.  Nobody deserves to be abused in any form no matter what.  If need be seek counseling to help you through the tough times.  Try and focus on yourself and get back some of your own self-respect before moving on.  You have a bright career and the sky is the limit in the medical field.  Your likely to be a beautiful lady and with a little healing you can bounce back better than ever.  Good Luck Chelsea|`|0udjgaoBaa	Forget talking to him about it...If you stay you deserve everything that he does to you...If your job suddenly said hey youre gonna do the jo b and we arent gonna pay you anymore.

Well, he's breaking them.  So go to the police and cut off the connection with this guy.|`|XAw4cJmjaa	You really need to cut communication with this guy. Sounds like he is out to continue to hurt you. You seem to have a good life without him, so stand up for yourself and end the abuse.
eO4y3m1maa	I think you need to figure out how to be happy ALONE because if you don't consider yourself happy without someone that isn't good!    Doesn't mean you need to break up with someone, just have some space..find something to make yourself happy.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	To make yourself feel more positive, start taking more control of your own life.  Decide on your goals in life and work toward meeting them.     A major one to think of:  Decide if your boyfriend is someone that you want in your life permanently; if he is, ask about getting married so that you are all legally a family and so that you have that committment to trust each other.  If he isn't (or doesn't want to commit), then decide what you are going to do about that--just live together hoping he'll change his mind (which leaves you living in a sort of limbo, not good for emotional stability) or contact a lawyer and start working out custody and other arrangments.    Decide what kind of person you want to be in 5, 10, or 20 years.  Start working on that.  Having goals and taking positive steps towards them does a great deal for making people more positive and satisfied with their lives.    Hope you find what's best for you and your family....
a6j0cwgqaa	I think you sound like my FAVORITE PERSON EVER!!! I don't think that's weird at all that you have everything planned out! I am getting married in April and I'm terrible and wish I had preplanned everything because I have been running around like a chicken with its head cut off!    Ha well I think you'd make an awesome wedding planner! I guess the best way to get started with that would be to see if you could become an assistant of a wedding planner. After you've seen how things are run you could break off and become your own name.  Be confident you can totally do this!    As for wanting to get married. I used to fantasize what my perfect wedding would be like (I didn't really plan though) I wanted to be married too! that day has finally come for me (lol, I just graduated high school last May) I am marrying the Man I've always wanted! (I've actually crushed on him since he spoke in my church about 3 years ago) Your time will come and you will dazzle everyone! Your Mr. perfect will be exactly that! Best of luck, I think you're totally awesome!|`|0Id85yiYaa	i'm engaged and getting married in 6 weeks and am not even close to that; so i'd say you're pretty obsessed. i wouldn't disclose this info to a guy you start dating.|`|26FPzSycaa	Well, I am in the same boat as you are, but I am engaged. I love watching all the shows, reading the mags, going over the details. I know for me, I just like that stuff.

Y dont you just tell him u want to be his girlfriend or u could just be his friend and tell him to stop teasing.|`|AA10435074	ok so u really love him huh? if hes sweet n stuff then he'll listen to you..... tell him to quit that !@ $ out and if he dont listen kick him in the shin or somethin......(my ex ex gf did that to me and it worked :*O) lol|`|c1a436ae599cb24ab3a10d30a1eccd03aa	I would say tell him how you feel, tell him i love you and make it serious and tell him your serious so he doesn't try and joke and if he does turn it into a joke then, just forget him because why sit around and wait for a guy that obviously doesn't care how you feel. Maybe he will start taking you a little more serious, and maybe his feelings are mutual. if he still wants to call you wifey, and is not serious or he doesn't feel the same way tell him to stop and see what he does.
bdebe05e816b215289cee7783a9254a1aa	Heart-to-heart time girly!!!!     Here, I'll help you out a bit:    You, "what's wrong with you?"  Her, (she's quiet, trying to ignore you, or she talks) "nothing"  You, "well, look. I've apologized to you lots of times, maybe even more than what you deserve since it was a stupid reason to get mad in the first place"  Her, "what ever"  You, "don't what ever me, (she turns around and begins to walk away) and come back here! Don't walk away while I'm talking to you. We were friends, right? And I still want to be friends but if this is how you plan to keep up a friendship then I don't know how you're every going to get around to having more than 0 friends"  Her "who said I was mad?"  You, "I can tell. You're not talking to me. You're just ignoring me. What's with that?"    It's all up to you and her now buddy. I can only narrate so far. Good luck.|`|AA11145682	yea she sounds like a brat jus slap her|`|43f636baa8bcd5c7ce66d74db1507e24aa	Tell her to get over it|`|6dfc3a3598b16111db0f0e2ca23eddaaaa	just wait  she'll come around|`|37120cd6e3c8941ff0990ddd7eab9e25aa	well, if she acts that way she may not really be your BFF, i know its hard to take it, but that's happened to me before. when i fought with my friend, she was acting all snobby too, so I just let her go and be the way she wants to, if she treats you like that, she doesn't deserve a good friend like you and you should become better friends with one of your other friends, maybe you guys will be BFF, some people (the friend you're fighting with), never reveal the real them to you until you are the "enemy". good luck & hope this helped

14fe31ab975d92528b246416441d51a6aa	That's no good my friend. A relationship is more than just friends. If she wants a relationship that has no physical properties to it then you're her "friend". I'd suggest letting her know that you'd like to go find someone who you can be friends AND make-out with. Let's face it guy's are more physical in relationship and women are more about the emotional/feelings. Both are important yet as male and female we work together to form a delicate balance of eachother's needs.

AA11452268	The meaning of the custom is that if you refuse it, you have refused her hospitality. No offense intended, but perhaps she found your refusal to take tiffen somewhat impolite.    To tattoo98...: In India, touching the feet of elders is a sign of respect. Tiffen is lunch or a light meal with coffee or tea. We're obviously talking about Indian marriage customs here.

26edc72fce41c870a6b401609703fe01aa	Since you're friends with his current girlfriend, you shouldn't do anything about your feelings right now. If he likes you so much, he should break up with her, but that's a decision he has to make for himself.    If/when he becomes "available", I think it's okay to go out with him, even if Meagan likes him. You can't do anything about the fact that you like each other. Of course, you should also ask yourself if you really want to go out with a guy who tells a girl he likes her when he's with someone else. That seems a little suspicious.|`|1fc10ea742d23d825c6afebe985bf823aa	HOW THE **** OLD  ARE YOU,TALK TO AN ADULD FOR CHRISTSAKKESW            GOD|`|AA11145682	omg

She talks to her friends about you         -Ask her friends if she mentioned you    Most important.    Ask her if she likes you. If you see these signs then you should ask her if she'd like to go out sometime, make sure you know her well.

Another thing you could do is to find pictures of her life and have some blown up and set them about, or put together a photo album of them (have someone scan and reprint the pictures in case something happens to that album).    I recently did a book for my now passed mother in law - she loved it.  I used one of these online book making services when you can scan in the photos, arrange them how you want and they print you a hard bound copy.  Get a few copies of the book made, and then if people want them they can have you order more. (they pay for them, of course.)|`|6YH2Hq5taa	congrats your almost dead|`|262c4d918a15f2377957a2a3deb2c12caa	Hi, my grandmother is 81 and I work with the elderly.

c4542537e3d94601a192be75e01a0586aa	man i can sympathise. i've been in a similar situation with a girl stuck on my mind. there's nothing wrong with that but i understand why people don't take you seriously. let me guess the people that aren't taking it seriously are mainly your family (immediate mostly) and your male friends?      i hate to break it to you but your family isn't likely to take it serious becauses they'll likely see it as nothing serious and guys will rip on you for it because we don't express feelings like this to eachother. so don't worry so much about that and it doesn't sound like your changing for her    with the hugging and kissing maybe she's just not used to it. i wouldn't stop completely but make it less frequent, only do it when there's meaning and reason to don't just do it out of no where until she gets more comfortable with it, all girls are different , some will love stuff like that and others will be uncomfortable, the more you're around her the more you'll get a feeling for it.    as far as buying things go it again depends on the kind of person. i'd be careful with that.  alot of girls would be embarassed by it and feel like you're spoiling them. i'd suggest you only buy her things on holidays or special occaisons... maybe once in a while as a nice little gesture but probably only small things.    i don't think you're taking it too serious and the statement that you only want the best for her means you're mature about this sort of thing and trust me girls will respect you ALOT more for it.  i don't think you're taking it too serious. it sounds like you've got it right but if the relationship ends (which it probably will eventually) don't take it too hard and keep the 'i only wnat what's best for her' in mind. relationships, especially while a teenager aren't meant to mean too too much but are an excelent learning experiecne. make sure you walk away from this with something.|`|AA10277407	Well this is sweet and no your not changing yourself to much for her. Love does that, we have no control over that. But, I do say this....its cool you buy her stuff because when you love someone you want to give them the moon. But....it can be done to much to the point of making someone un-comfortable for many reasons. They may think if they keep taking they will owe you something, or you are trying to buy them. Or, they may feel bad they don't have the money to buy you something back. Don't over do it buying things if it appears it may make her un-comfortable.

I'd love it for a guy to do all that for me. I'm sure she loves you just as much as you do. Forget what others say you do what you need to do with her if she don't like it she'll let you know or she'll reject you. (like try not to hug you) and your not changing yourself as long as you still like all the things that you do before y'all when out  and not stop liking them cause of her then your not changing yourself  well I hope i explained this as clear as possible|`|2s27lPn9aa	Since Jan 11th 2007--->  You are not i love right now your in a new relationship and you need to take it slow. Ya kissing and hugging is nice, but take it easy. Don't try to buy her affection with gifts, find out what she likes and do it. Movies, picnics, zoos, dinner, etc. Talking is important as well this is the time when you should be learning more about each other that's how you find out what she's all about and what she likes. Remember slow it down and have a good time take things as they come don't force it, in time she'll come around.

AA11128712	It's maybe not 'normal' (whatever that is) but it's certainly not unusual.  Lots of girls love being spanked, and lots love being verbally abused during sex, and very often the two go together.  She's just a bit kinky, that's all - and kinky girls are usually a lot of fun in bed.      So go ahead and do what she wants.  It'll be a big turn-on for her, and that'll probably make it a big turn-on for you too.  Enjoy!

I also enjoy being spanked while having an orgasm! I love being on top and feeling him go in and out while his hands spank my a.. at the same time. The feeling of pleasure and the stinging at the same time is quite a turn on!
2539fc87bacda29b194ba57acecea7eaaa	can you turn up the heat on the water heater? or shower before he usually gets in?|`|AA12345516	I'm sure it will cause some tension but if your sister pays equal rent then she deserves to get a hot shower, and since I assume the boyfriend is not paying any rent then if he is going to shower there at all it should be after everyone else has had their showers.|`|i4wchS1baa	You can't go through life avoiding tension in every situation.  If he is going to take showers there, he needs to be considerate of the RESIDENTS of the home and their needs.  It seems like he's doing far more than visiting if he's staying there in excess of 50% of the week.  I think I'd be asking for his portion of the rent also.
1bbb93fb01e19af781dd2d771fdd791aaa	You could find a dress that you like "off the rack". Their is usually a pretty good discount for not ordering and buying it. You may still need alterations though.     A close friend did all my flowers and they were BEAUTIFUL!     You could look for a hall that has everything in one.. hall, cake and such.     It is also cheaper to have a buffet style dinner and most people usually like it better because they can eat what/as much as they want.     Personally, I would not want a sterio at my wedding. Look for a cheap DJ.     I also don't see the importance of an open bar. Most people expect to pay for their drinks.     The bridesmades all buy their own dresses so that won't be an issue.   Also, a lot of tuxedo rental places will give you the grooms rental for free as long as the groomsman rent theirs.     A Church depends.... sometimes you have to pay for janitor cleaning after the ceremony. Use of the Church, offociant, organist and/or piano player.   These are defianately places where you can cut some costs...     You could also go to a craft store and make your own veil and such. Most have beautiful tiars and things to do it with. If you are not a crafty person then have a friend or family member do it.     For my invatations I had a friend do it. She is in graphic arts and she bought some BEAUTIFUL paper and printing them on her computer. We bought the nice envelopes and such to go with it. They were just as beautiful as I could have ordered.     We also did not have limo's.   My hubby and I both had a Mustang so we had the bridal party drive our cars. Hubby and I rented a convertable mustang and we all drove there.     You really should have a good photogropher. You will want these pictures forever.     GOOD LUCK and congratulations to you!!!!

Their matching system http://www.weddinglenox.com/membersignup...  will match you up with local vendors with pricing you specified. I tried it and have good result as I only recieved response from vendors according to my request.    One problem I had with my wedding is that it is hard to locate vendors in most website as most likely they group by states and there are too many of them that's too far from me and I have to look at each site to figure out.    The sites I provide above have a easy to use layout to show you pictures, pricing and location in one page plus, you can send out your inquiry for matching vendor to contact you. That save me lots of time to locate the best vendors with the right price.
zyFQoPGsaa	I know exactly how you feel.  The same thing happened to me before.  The only difference is it wasn't planned and she said she didn't go all the way.  You will never forget what happened.  It wont stop hurting for another months.  I'm sure by this time you have played the scenario out in your head 1000 times.  It gets better after about 3 months.  The only downside is anything that resemebles something that has to do with what happened will trigger the same crap you feel now.  I'm still with my gf 2 years later.  She said her sorry's and blah blah blah.  I told her that the only way I would get back with her is if she got a tattoo of my name on an area that only her mom and I see.  She got it and we are still together.  It's not a good idea to forgive because that will never happen.  I know you probably feel that you have invested a lot in this girl, 8 years of your life and probably plenty of money.  So you don't want to just give up, but its over.  Most likely you two got together at too young of an age and this is her way of living out the past.  If there is any premeditation it means it will happen again.  You just need to ask yourself, "Do I want to stay with this girl, marry her, have children and then catch her cheating on me again, get divorced, worsen my childrens chances for a normal life, give her half of everything you own, pay child support and possibly alimony?".  Its an honest question|`|AA11903560	Dump her now............move on.......after a eight year bond she should not want to cheat... to the left, to the left|`|b66e7983570d624d142f0be8483a5ddfaa	WAKE UP!!!!!!! you saw it coming, she lied about it for 2 months, she doesn't respect you. walk away.|`|EyVxmG2zaa	find someone else|`|F9oPoAh9aa	leave her  and find another nice girl|`|AA10917065	This happened to me also and it took around 3 years to heal my wounded heart. So let me share what was helpful for me to survive.    Let me ask you one thing. Or rather you ask yourself: "has SHE cheated you or it is YOU who is feeling cheated?".... is cheating an active phenomena ?.. What did she actually did?..     Lets make it simpler. She went with another guy. Going with another guy is an transitive action that can be DONE. But can cheating be an transitive/active phenomena ?.. You got what I wanna say ?...     ok.. she lied you. At that point of time she had to conceal her secret so there was no other way left for her than lying. And now realized and she must be guilty of her deed.     Now come to your role in this. Have you thought of any mistake your made?.. or what contribution U made to enrich your relationship? May be she is bored or no longer interested in you. I know this is a hard thing for any human ego to digest. We naturally feel rejected in this situation. I was also feeling rejected when my gf went with another guy. But later I took it as refusal, not rejection. And I moved away...    So how can you maintain your esteem now!... the most practical way is to concentrate of your role in this universe. As a son, as a brother, as a son... what we're supposed to do for our near & dear ones. You be yourself. Do what you need to do in this world. And let her do what she wants. Maintain your calmness... and stay near your "self"...     Remember cheating and forgiving are two sides of the coin. If you become aware of your self then there is no cheating, and no forgiving.... U just remain your self...|`|RUZ3Isoyaa	i am sorry for such things happened to you... u must be feeling confused and hurt now. from what u describe...     let her go...she dont deserve your love anymore...  but like what you say, forgive her.. it will take sometime to heal...    I experienced something like that before... and had moved on.. I am glad that i made that decision because i know i will find my true love one day..|`|jt6aQ4yKaa	It may be true that you love her very much and dont want to let her go but let her go.Once a cheater will always be a cheater.Let her go and wait for the right girl.It may hurt in the begining but you will have someone sincere and loyal.Wish you best of luck!

DZIX1Mtvaa	I think he likes you. If he looks at you a lot and knows your name then most likely he likes you. I bet he really does remember you from kindergarten but didn't admit it when you asked him. I say, just keep looking to see if he looks at you and become better friends with him (if you want to)|`|AA12073051	try asking him most memorable moments or ones that would make him like you more|`|H2too49daa	OMG!! That is like the cutest thing ever!  You should probably invite him out or something so you can talk more to him! It's not uncommon for girls to ask guys out somewhere nowdays!  Anyways, it sounds like he's into you too and you should ask because he might be shy or something... if you dont ask you are never going to know!!! Have courage and ask him...You have nothing to lose!! Good luck girlie!! |`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	just talk to him more and see what happens|`|AA11116264	YES. and the beauty of a new school no one knows you. So you could walk right up to him and ask him and make a complete fool of yourself if he says no (WHICH HE WON"T) and no one will really pay attention to you. :)|`|1d0506f135929cc8816ac80d0ea1b762aa	awwww i think so|`|E5rjGBL3aa	I think he's definitely interested in you! Start talking to him more and see where things go. The only way to find out if he likes you for sure is to ask, but I'd wait a bit to do that.|`|vuMxFJJVaa	talk to him
13c934012cf02b1ade18c8f6f6f4b992aa	I would say it is just a hug to show you appreciate being with him. Is he hesitant to give you one back? If not I'm sure he enjoys it. If he didn't he would say something. Im sure he really enjoys spending time with you.     Your safe in my book.|`|XIrMPT5Faa	no thats ok (:|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Having a standing movie date every weekend is far more intimate than hugging him. Don't worry about it.|`|DT84bcetaa	You may give him the wrong idea. I have had difficulty maintaining friendships with my exes. Once in a while I hug one of them when I see her but it is still too weird and I have to force myself to realize that she wants us to stay apart. If he tries anything more then you need to lay down the law as nicely as possible but if it stays at hugging then its ok. Remember he is vulnerable from his divorce too!|`|J5Mevbz7aa	na i think thats okay|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	I don't think you are going to far because if he takes it the wrong way all he is probly thinking well at less someone cares about me.|`|3wFt9fyZaa	Why are you even meeting him.  I hope you are not in any relationship.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	if you both enjoy the contact then no it is not going to far if either one of you is uncomfortable about the hug then stop doing it|`|HvJpbTH8aa	its a hug! thats not going tooo far.|`|4sK0aJlDaa	hugs are ok if there isno intention|`|vsr7Jmhraa	no i dont think givin him a hug is wrong... just make sure you dont end up hurt and what is going to happen between you. Hopefully everything works out|`|EkLJDcc7aa	nah, just dont make him think that you think your going too far.|`|23SwPCUgaa	I think that a hug is harmless and fine. You are just trying to comfort him.       Good luck! :)|`|mLEajSwNaa	its a hug its nothing|`|W618lfZ6aa	No way, you both cared about each other at one point and there will always be some part of you that will still care.

Its okay!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Do what you feel.|`|b7gDKbTYaa	Depends if ur like a super-nice person do u give everyone hugs cause if not then, he'll think their might be sumtin there i may be 16 but im still a guy :D|`|cpDLTsbiaa	How cutee ^^ Kiss him too.

oP504BtFaa	We've been married nearly twenty years (19, almost 20) and I am still as much in love with him as I was when we got married. Even now I will admit that after not seeing him for a few days (when he's on business trips or if he's just been out of the house all day long) I still get a flutter in my tummy.

I am willing to bet that he would say virtually the exact same thing, too.|`|um29wkUPaa	Very very much.  Married 11 years.  Together...?  I dont know, lots more.

Married 13 years this summer solstice.|`|AA11285895	Absolutely.  We have been married for 13 and a half years.  We are committed and have made that commitment to each other.  We are mature adults who have made up in our mind that we will love "til death do us part."  When you both set your mind that you will never divorce, it makes you work through the problems--what is the alternative?  Too many people have the "option" of divorce available.  Close off that option--no, you don't feel trapped.  As a matter of fact you are completely liberated to love unselfishly and completely.  By the way, I am a male.|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	Yes - he's my best friend.  25 years this year.|`|5p7gpj36aa	wow, am I the only one trying to figure that one out right now?  man -- good for you though, all of you.

7Icg8uKraa	Smack yourself in the face and get over with it! He made a girl pregnant... and you guys have been on and off in the relationship. You already gave him a chance. Stick to your current b/f and just support your friend.|`|XKpM9C9Gaa	hmmm that's a bit of a conundrum|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	there's not much you can do if he loves his gf and they decide to bring this child up together. you have to take a backseat if you were meant to be together you would of been already i think you are panicking because now there is serious commitment between him and his gf you feel you are losing your friend be happy for them make time for them play a part in all their lives if you can do so without malice if not steer clear and allow them to get on with things. because if you mess this up for him he may end up hating you and in time if you are meant to be together you will be. good luck

He's a great kisser but terrible with his hands, amongst other things.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	What would a zero be?|`|Zgs4RncIaa	how about 0 being "why am I even here?"    Thats why we don't have sex, I have my toys they never fail me!    Lost2day? Umm was the 0 for no compassion for me?   If So! Whatever, until you lay in my spot, dont judge!    I'm just curious, does anyone on here know me or my husband? Just making sure!|`|BlVudiyfaa	mines Cajun, so it's 11. These Cajun women...|`|4qT0TfMZaa	She's an eleven!|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	On ability, he gets an 8. On willingness, he gets a 15. My husband's _______ is smedium (not small, but smaller than big). Where he is deficient- not deficient but different than me- is that he cums quick. He always, always gets back up though. The reason why I'm not a fan ot this is because sometimes I'd like to go on without the break because the break always lets a little steam outta me.     He gets a 15 for willingness because there is NOTHING that I can ask of him that he won't try. He's trooper for sure and has earned his spot at  1 on my list. Yes, I have keep a list of everybody I've ever been with sexually, and remember each in detail.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I would give you  a 0 for compassion. Melissa, not arguing with you,my dear. I think it s mean and malicious to judge your partner in bed on a public forum..|`|T7qgrOJzaa	10 lol. The only man whose ever given me the big O. And it just keeps getting better.|`|L38M9lrLaa	a 3 he did give me a child lol|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	9.5   as i need a break|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Mine is the blow up doll without the air and he doesn't seem to have a pulse.so that would make him a -3.|`|dWLGK7nlaa	11, he's the best!!!
W0KQTXrvaa	no, and santa doesn't exist|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Marriage is about trust , once you start questioning the trust your questioning your marriage, was she drunk? I would beleive her.|`|BlVudiyfaa	My ex wife kept falling down and men kept falling on top of her. It was the most amazing thing.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Sure...but I'd wonder where she went AFTER the bar.|`|9dNEw7etaa	Well did she look drunk when she came home?  I would think you'd be able to tell.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Of course she only had one drink on your credit card. The other drinks were on the credit card of the guy who took her to a hotel when the bar closed at 2.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Depends what she said she was going out for and when she told you she'd be back.  My hubby has gone out before, come home at 5am, but he went to a show and then for a drink with the boys and just had some fun.  But if she is being a bit shady about what she did all that time, I'd probably be a bit suspicious too.  Has she given you reason to suspect her before?|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Nope.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Sure you should believe she only had one drink at the bar...she had the other 10 drinks at some guy's love shack.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Well yea... do you have a reason not to trust her?|`|WjxqhZG9aa	She may have only had one drink that she paid for.  There's no reason that one drink should take that long.  That may not have been the only thing she was doing. So she's likely just telling a half truth.|`|AA10197672	This is your wife and your life. Just because majority here says yes or no does not mean they know any better. You need to see if she is a trustworthy person to begin with. If she has ever done anything in the past to break that in you. There is a lot that involves in this situation....|`|NGKwsawdaa	She's shady, i hope you're smarting than to believe her lame story. and BTW there is no bar that is open till 4 in the morning|`|aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	Well, let's see. Did she look or act or smell drunk? Were you not around when she came home? Was she with friends or alone? Too many unanswered questions and vairables. What we believe doesn't matter, what do you believe? Is she a liar? Has she lied to you before or do you have trust issues from your past? Most bars close earlier than that but that depends on where you are. Who brought her home???? You really just can't expect us to answere....I'd be fair until I had a reason not to be then I would let it all go....that's me. All or nothing. Without trust there is nothing really. I believe that and I find it hard to efer trust again. You might need to ask her and go from there, you really need to talk it out. Miss Mary|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Unless you think she has some reason to lie to you...assume she's being honest.    I would hope my husband would trust that what I tell him is the truth.  However, I doubt I'd ever be out that late...I don't think I could stay awake that long!|`|2ebd8c899f6ffcd59a224386f106fbcaaa	Maybe she drove her friends home.  Sat chatting with friends or someone else.  Went for a drive to clear her head.  Unless you have reasons to believe otherwise, believe her.|`|yAZq4SLaaa	Only if she had to work until 2am. Otherwise NO. Maybe SHE only bought ONE drink... but how many were bought FOR her???|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Did she give you some other reason for not believing her or is it that you just dont want to believe her for whatever reason? My vote is for believing her unless something else happened|`|ad153b7afea3d1e4c3bb669e8b8bf28faa	how long does it take to have one drink? and why was she there in the first place when you were at home? it doesnt look good!|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	ha um no. i would never stay at a bar til 4am on only one drink
YqoxcTN9aa	i am realizing now that my b/f has mental issues, i am just trying to get up the courage to have him move out, he has a tendancy to be verbally & physically abusive & drink to much|`|AuKKjaxaaa	At some point sex is not enough to keep a relationship going.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Yes. I realized there was something wrong with my ex after I got pregnant. I learned he had bipolar disorder and the symptoms became much more obvious when I got pregnant because stress can trigger an episode. It became so horrible that I had to file a restraining order against him for abuse.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Sounds like you've out grown her.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes, I have.  I stayed. So far.  We all have our issues.|`|aOinzEvYaa	Most women have mental issues...men have to instruct them in the right path.  To answer your question, of course, and I usually stayed with them.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	u just matured and she didnt. be glad ur not married|`|X1YVUA5oaa	You sure she's just not immature?|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	Most men are born with mental issues. This is nothing new, right ladies?|`|o1yy6KABaa	It sounds as though the rose coloured glasses have suddenly lost colour, the sparks gone and there is nothing else keeping you interested. Its normal.|`|Bz21ztapaa	i'm on the other side of the spectrum, my man realized i have mental issues, and he refuses to leave me. WHAT a keeper, i'm not childesh though, just pshyco mental. Thanks for sticking by me.|`|RHux2Fmnaa	Yes, I did realize he was "not all there" and left. Your GF might just be immature or she thinks you find her childish behavior "cute". Some women -for some weird reason- think that it's cute and sexy to act like total idiots: baby-talk, little-girl-like gestures, etc. You need to let her know you're not into that. Maybe she'll just start being herself again.  You've let this behavior go on for too long already, so she might think you actually like it.  Be honest and talk to her about this, unless you have no feelings for her anymore or you've got your eyes set on someone else...|`|yy45iAbtaa	i left just realized the guy is phyco.yells allot and likes to argue and blame others instead of himself  could be the drinking  you think.|`|3iNobwVraa	Most people are thoroughly shallow.  To be fair, it probably isn't entirely her fault.  It's our society.  We have been told certain things matter, (logos, brands, blah, blah) and we've been told other things don't matter (ideas, discourse, exploration, thinking.)    Tell her to turn off the idiot box and pick up a book.  Actually, you guys could go find one together about something you both think is interesting, read a bit each night and debate.  Make an argument.  Defend it.  Stimulate each other in new ways    Good Luck!!
PuWucUs3aa	im so afraid to answer your question. hehehehe.. i might be reported to what i have to say. give me a best 10 points then email me, i'll teach you.. or IM me.. its ok.|`|AhhMzIBGaa	I had the same problem and was really worried that it would be awkward but it comes natural. When it happens you will slowly go in for the kiss and if she wants to kiss you back she will meet you half way and youll get better at it as time goes on.
IXskJPlVaa	Sorry lovely girl - you can hardly do anything to help. At the most - be very caring for mommy, and talk to her, help her in whatever way you can in the house - that's the most you can do. Best of luck.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Unfortunately, you can't do anything to change the situation between your parents.  You can, however, stand up for yourself in the situation.  If either your dad or your mom begin to say things about one another to you, you should speak up and explain that it's hurtful to you when they speak negatively about one another to you.  Tell them both that you no longer want to be in the middle of their problems with one another and that you won't listen when they attempt to say things that are hurtful to you.  After you've told them this, cut them off when they start to say something like that.  Remind them that you don't want to be in the middle of it.  Tell them that you are leaving the room to avoid hearing it and that you can speak again when the subject is changed.  Then leave the room for about half an hour.  This action on your part should get the message across to them that you don't want to be a part of their negativity and drama.|`|AA10389562	You are neither the cause nor can you be the solution to their problems.  The best you can do is plead with them to seek professional help and to also let you talk with a trained counselor.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	The only thing you can do is go and comfort your mom but she has to be the one to stand up to him or leave him if he is mean to her .   It is best when 2 adults are fighting to stay out of it unless there is violence then sneak and call911.   Sorry I know it's hard but just go give mom so love hugs.|`|v6MvF2Mgaa	Mind your own business! Don't get involved. It will do no good and only further strain your relationship with your father.|`|03llfXdpaa	My parents did the same thing with me when they were going through their divorce. All you can do is express to them how much it bothers you that they speak so negatively. If they can see how much their petty ways are hurting their child then they should stop doing that and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Sorry honey, but this is just between them. Nothing you can to will help. They have to work this out themselves.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Nothing
F9Ll7oLJaa	but now a days divorce is becoming more and more common  in India|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I think Western culture (as much as I admire it and love living it in) as absolutely destroyed marriage.     Your culture would be wise to not take any lessons on marriage from the west.     Good Luck!|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Good question!other questions are waste  -You and I can start a online organisation to solve this problem  -You can write e mails to me|`|HAk6iROaaa	India, should firstly accept, that divorce and breakups DO exist in that country and not be sanctimonious by saying that this is a western culture thing.... Face up to it, your country is changing, other cultures have now mingled with Indian culture and you cannot expect things in your country to stay the same. Yes, women have become more empowered in India, they have top jobs, the earn good money, and they are starting to have financial independence, some of them, with this is coming a new found confidence, and with this is coming a feistiness.  They can now LEAVE their husbands if they are not happy, they no longer have to put up with immature mother in laws, and tense households, with their husbands acting as mommies boys....  You are wrong, in Indian cities these days, the divorce rate is soaring, which means there are a lot of divorcees around, which means that there will be a lot of divorcees meeting other divorcees....  I think India has never been in a better place EVER (for women especially).  Divorce is a way out for a lot of unhappy people, it is not a bad thing....|`|z5hrgF45aa	so true i am going thru it as well. I guess everyone gets married thinking it will last forever. but when one of the partner cheats, tortures the other and makes them feel not cared for. it is not called marriage. it is best to move on and not live a miserable life.|`|H25kJXYDaa	Just ask National Womens Commision to remove biased and foolish laws like Indian penal code 498a and DV act. There will be 99.9% less divorce in India.
rpJu5XfUaa	There are some girls that would die for boobs like yours, at least your not flat chested because you would look like a boy lol. I don't have boobs as large as yours but my sisters are a similar size and she thinks they are her best assest, she also does not flaunt them but she knows that some men like larger boobs so she is not afraid to use them to her advantage if she is interested in a guy, not in a slut way though!     You have nothing to worry about, you have obviously just developed quicker than some other people and i am sure that your parents don't mind buying you bra's because with GG you will deifnately need them so they don't drop to the floor.     You friends sound like they are jealous really that you have fantastic sized boobs and you should be proud not worried.     x|`|TqpFbhJwaa	i developed big boobs before all the girls in the 5th grade. and it was in embarrassing at first for me but then I just kind of got use to it as time gone by. and all the other girl started to catch up to me it Begin to not seem so awkward to me. Plus talking to friends and my mom made it seem less awkward to me as I was going through changes early during the 5th grade.|`|6GcS2r1vaa	im in usa...not sure wat size that iz but yea...got the same problem.... so this is something that might help yu...everyday chew 8 lemon seeds, and swallow...lol for many many months...lol not sure exactly how many but dont stop..and that will stop them from getting bigger...which as yu get older will happen. so 8 seeds a day...thats all i can say.|`|GiyXZ3Ktaa	Your not the only one i have had FF boobs since i was 13 and im 15 now, yes the bras are expensive n the ones you find are like granny bras its very frustrating but dont worry people pay for boobs like yours but your lucky you got them for free lol|`|xLEiYdzXaa	i've got bigger   i hate them   but there's nothin i can do|`|MBHg4TCTaa	that's is a problem :S    try talking to someone in a shop that you get along with and ask them to order some for you.  tell da girls in your PE that they are just jealous :)
iAphlpqKaa	thats not that big of a deal.... maybe she didnt pick up on accident.. you cant expect her to answer while she is at the dentist with your brother, she is busy    you're being selfish|`|WSoGO54eaa	It's not your mom's fault. She was probably doing something and could not answer the phone. You were not planning on going anyhow so let  it be. Things come up in life at not so good times and do not always work out. It is no ones fault.|`|00b5UjqBaa	You need to calm down.  Next, you need to grow up.  When you're in the dentist's office, you don't have your cell phone on. Nor do you answer calls. She could've been busy. A basketball game is not worth insulting your mother. It's not that big of a deal, so you should stop blowing it up.
YI5QnbUjaa	Learn how to say No!  I know you want to please everyone, but you should really worry about pleasing yourself first.  If you don't want to go, tell her you can't and tell her why.  She is your friend.  She will understand.|`|DT84bcetaa	Hang out at the meeting place or in the car (and bring condoms).|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If you can't do it, maybe you can meet her halfway of the location you are and your friend as well so that way, the gas would not be wasted.|`|oFUqegjfaa	Just tell her your parents won't let you go.  Its easier and she'll probably have less of a bad reaction if she can't blame you.|`|WSoGO54eaa	Explain to your parents how you feel and let them think of a way to get you out of it. You will gain more trust for doing so and that is what parents are for.|`|uhmWX5Qkaa	Tell her that you cant make it due to the fact your busy that night etc. dont hang out with someone you dont want to.....|`|CzHreFFFaa	na make an excuse fool.
R4EYPeLGaa	I'm sorry. You shouldn't have done it, but hopefully she sees how upset you are and she gives you another chance. And if she does, you can't blow it this time.    Hopefully it doesn't get blown out of hand and everyone finds out but if not then you should be able to make amends.    Bake her some brownies. =]    *Have some hugs. You need them.|`|aaoWVDxMaa	Apologise.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Apologize would be the best thing for you right now.|`|VEi3R0craa	just about everything i am told I tell my husband and he tells me.  but its between us.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	Apologise repeatedly  and yeah i have but i only told my mum and i tell her everything and she doesnt really count|`|HcwIDjMiaa	yeah although I wasn't really in the wrong I still felt pretty bad and apologized.     well if you haven't already apologized go do so and hopefully she forgives you.|`|yEqEbVWOaa	TIme will heal things, but you need to apologize right away.|`|5PIVJJSKaa	Ok so since you know that you totally messed up and That you need to apologise i dont get what the question is... Just make nice and everything will get better is all i can say.|`|KszocgnSaa	Yea I'm a stupid person who makes lots of mistakes. Thank god there are people willing to put up with it.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	yes i stayed married to a man for over 10 yrs, when i shouldn't have. staying with someone like this is a waste of time, and its hard to make things work without help from the other person in the relationship. but to be fair about it, have u ever sat down and told him about how u feel?|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Depends on what's important to you. No one person is going to be 100% perfect. Someone might satisfy you sexually 100%, but then you find out they are fiscally irresponsible. Or you might have a great emotional connection, but he's not that good in bed, with no signs of improvement. In each situation, you have to decide if your gains are bigger than your losses; but there will always be losses and compromises.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Only a 23 year old would dump a guy over 50/50 sex.......sexual fulfillment is YOUR responsibility too, you know.....    And by the way, if you are looking for a flawed human being to "complete" you, your in for a rude awakening because it is NOT going to happen!  There are no perfect people on this Earth.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	You should be complete when you meet them.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You're 23 and you've been with a man for 6 years.  That would have made you 17 when you met him.  Did you have any other sexual experience or are you just curious about what else is out there?  If it's the latter, before you throw away something solid, you should really make sure your expectations are based on reality and not fantasy.  In my opinion, much of what is being sold today is fantasy and not real at all.    Real marriage takes work and compromise.  No one is 100% happy 100% of the time.  You will never find this, because it doesn't exist.    I'm not really sure what you mean by "didn't complete you," because I have a different view.  I think that it takes two whole people to make a great relationship and we shouldn't go around looking for another person to make ourselves happy.  Instead, we should focus on being the best partner we can be to the one we are with and if we see that it isn't working no matter how hard we try, we part ways.  As much for the other person's well being as our own.|`|faT4MyVkaa	If you are looking for Mr. 100% in everything, you will look till your dead.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	I stayed for 20 years..I almost died inside.  Got out.  Haven't regretted it yet.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Stay with him and try different things. Talk to him, communication is very important. No one is perfect and neither are you. If you leave him for someone else, that person may be worse then your current boyfrend is. Try to work things out, try new things, experiment and ultimately, love him.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Who knows how your libido will hold up, sex is likely a huge part of you and your relationship right now, but that could change, sex may not be so important for awhile and it could change back. There is no way to tell if its worth it. Only you can figure that out.|`|ZlVPMsWTaa	No one person should 'complete' you. That's utter Hollywood bull. You should be complete when you met the person.    Sex isn't everything. Get a hobby or something. If all you rely on is sex, then the relationship was never stable to begin with.|`|mzYsk112aa	Yeah.  You can make it WORK.  I'd rather make it fun.  The silly question you asked is "will i eventually get tired on ........."  YOU ALREADY ARE!  Best thing you can do is find somebody that makes you love who YOU are when you are with them.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Yes and dumped him yesterday.  Yes, you will get tired...let him go!    Sounds like you "settled" and no one should do that.|`|dvX11ttNaa	Neh. I wouldn't plan on marrying him if I were you, but sure it might last pretty long :)    Good luck!|`|a804958f4ae350dd48a19bd98ba830a5aa	Trust me no one is perfect. Do you feel safe w/ him? Could you see yourself w. someone else? My b/f and I do not have the best sex life but we love each other and he is always there for me. Example.. I had to go to the hospital he sat w/ me holding my hand the entire 19 hours I was there! My other b/f before him (many years ago) i had to go to the hospital (I have kidney problems) and the first chance he got to have a friend pick him up he was out of there. I knew that moment he was not the one.   Things like sex can be fixed you just have to work on things and try new things. The anger.. well that is another situation. Safety is most important. If you do not feel safe w. him then maybe you should think about staying w/ him. Maybe he knows he has a problem and wants to do something. would talk to him about his anger. If he gets upset I would leave.|`|AA11661476	I think I finally realized after 14 years of marriage even though my husband and I a have a great time together we are missing deep conversations, deep intimacy...
LYVDtbFZaa	if you want to end it for good just stop talking to her or just keep doing what your doing because in most cases that will lead to less and less until there is nothing left
GeruGGOQaa	Because they like what they've got to work with not what they want.  It's like picking a car that needs a little body work versus a car that needs a new engine, new transmission, body work, paint job, etc.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I have never tried to change my husband.    Just like him i have my flaws and i'm not perfect so why would i try and change him.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Change could only do me better.|`|RtkB46peaa	Why do they do it?  I have no idea.  But I agree with you.  It's not uncommon for a woman to spend her entire married life trying to change her husband, all the while making everyone miserable.|`|vFCva8R5aa	LMAO Mr Paul Starr     I love that...i am going to have to send that to my husband!    Oh and before i get another violation, i will attempt to answer your question (even though i don't really know)     Women change what they want in a man throughout their lives so instead of getting a new man every few years they just try to change the one they have to meet their needs.|`|8txWayVnaa	Men marry women hoping they WON'T change.  Women marry men,  hoping they WILL change.    Therein lies the problem.    ADD:    *screaming laffing at Mr. Paul*|`|BhlGe0A8aa	Because they really don't know them at all.  When people meet they are on their best behaviour ,this could continue for many months-might even be until they are married.!  It is only then that they show their true colours and their real personality.By then it is too late.  So the person they thought they had married is now nonexistent,hence they want to change them back to the person they were pretending to be before!  GET IT!|`|JFKPqQV1aa	tell her this:  We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules from the male side.    1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us griping about you leaving it down.    2. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!    3. Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.    4. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.    5. Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.    6. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.    7. Crying is blackmail.    8. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!    9. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.    10. Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty,  would look good with your dress?    11. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.    12. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.    13. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.    14. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.    15. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to answer.    16. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.    17. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.    18. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.    19. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.    20. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your girlfriends.    21. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.    22. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.    23. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.    24. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.    25. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.    26. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.    27. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.    28. You have enough clothes.    29.

Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that, it's like camping|`|NzrTIPPuaa	Its a mystery isn't old boy, you'd think they'd just be grateful. And they wonder why we stray, silly little things. Tip top.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Why does a man marry a woman hoping that she WONT change??  They dont stay young, firm, and sexy forever but you'd LIKE for them to, wouldnt you?  The mystery of your question goes both ways.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	i read posts about men coming down hard on how women always want to change their men. remember this, theres nothing to change if men know how to mature like us women.   and secondly, i dont understand why men complain about it...they do it anyway. =)|`|tsBL19qzaa	They do that because they married the wrong man to begin with. If they had married the right man, there would be no need to try and change them.|`|pErRGYH7aa	Why do the men allow it?  -- PANSIES!|`|ZVsrg16saa	It's because they're wired up all wrong mate.  I know, because I've been married to one for 25 years.She's given up trying to change me. Old age has done the job for her. The little cow has won again.|`|ff32225b284101d05a2982908b6b5febaa	because NONE of them meet our standards to start with.So we have to find the one that at least has some potential and try and make it liveable|`|w8LtNSvaaa	to ruin our live.|`|QIwhMrBraa	thats a very good question. as a woman i agree many women try to change a man, which in my opinion is b*llshit. i wouldnt marry anyone unless i was totally happy with who they were (or at least who i thought they were, people can fool u cant they).    a lot of women are just never happy and have nothing better to do than nag their man. then when they have a son they baby him even after he's reached his 40th birthday.    how many women kill off their husbands after years of nagging? maybe thats another good question. and it's legal killing, innit?|`|CkWE05Baaa	i don't even remember the question!! still to busy laughing at mr paul starr!! LMAO.|`|Zca1PGERaa	personally i prefer a man who can change his own clothes ;-)
iPNOVR6Gaa	Here is how you should reply:    "Thank you for the email.  I am so happy for you that you have found a new girl and that she is a virgin, which I know is important to you!  I hope things go well for you and her.  As you know, I really used to care for you deeply, so I naturally want you to be happy in your future.  I hope you can be happy for me too, because my husband and I are getting along great now.  We are doing so well that I have decided that it would be a bad idea ever to have anymore contact with you.  Right after I send this, I am going to mark your email address as spam in my filter so that I am not tempted to have any more contact with you after this.  Good-bye, good luck, and thank you ever so much for your prayers!"    Yes, I know it's at least 80% lies, but so what?  It's what you need to do, for your sanity, and for your badly wounded marriage.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	You want to reply, but shouldn't.  He did contact you to get you jealous, to play games - whatever, it's solely for him to feel better about himself, not for you.  Replying to him would be telling him that he got to you, that he accomplished whatever it is he wanted.  How to move on - simply live your life.  Forget him, make it so he can't send you e-mails.  Focus hard on the other things in your life.  Before you know it, you've moved on!  Good luck.|`|SiniSj1eaa	Honestly I would just not talk to him anymore..eventually you will move on from him and this will make it faster..    if not I really like what happy wrote..|`|fDT0YhROaa	you just have to. are you sure it wasn't the new girl who emailed you? or insisted that he does and told him what to say? maybe it's karma?|`|G2IoZpeqaa	Thats why he told you to make you jealous to test the water .... I dont vsee the point in telling someone..its only his words that they are so tremendously suited and get on well...time will heal thats all I can say ...really dont understand why he would want to tell you he met somene knowing you would be hurt...good luck|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	am i really confused? what the hell does your husband think about this?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	You should wish him well in his new relationship and move on.  Block his email address so you won't get anymore messages about his happiness and all that.  There's no reason for you to torture yourself.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	You don't reply to the email, mark his email address as spam, and move on with your life.|`|0XCSQsf3aa	He told you that on purpose to make you jealous. Don't fall for it.
5Bk4SYQIaa	Quite a while, haha!  I'm a single mom and I only use milk when I'm cooking something, or if I want to put some in my tea or coffee! My 2 year old, Ella is okay with milk but only drinks it with certain foods.  I'd give the milk a week and a half to live ;)    Creative Question!                   - Alice|`|AA10068028	It depends!|`|tGlnumvKaa	It lasts about a day in mine, but we drink a lot of milk. It should last at least till the expiration date. If it doesn't you need to turn the cool knob higher.|`|AA10857451	Depends on how many people drink out of it and how much each one has.
pQBjqMkoaa	lies and broken promises are the same    you know someone asked a question the other day asking "if your signifcant other broke all the promises would you still love them"...    eh it depends on the promises he broke    details please|`|YMzRBzZAaa	Well a promise is like an unpaid debt so yeah you should be mad!|`|f34d32a0c03129358a4bc0eed14d93e0aa	Hi Aleksis    I would class lies and broken promises to be in the same category.  They are both deceitful and hurting to the person in question, so I don't blame you for being angry if he has mislead your trust.  Little lies and broken promises lead to bigger lies and people like this just cannot be trusted as you'll always be asking yourself, is he telling the truth or not or can I trust him enough to tell him this secret?  Just be weary of him and try to nip it in the bud but if it continues then I suggest you tell him to slide on, sorry!    Luv Magsx|`|LYVDtbFZaa	yeah they are
Xhy6VEzOaa	yeah it's completely normal to feel out of place and stuff  probably just hormones..  if it really bugs you, u could talk to a friend about it  you'd be surprised on how much they feel the same way|`|gapWTVmDaa	Yes it's amazing. Did you know that by quantum mechanics laws everything is connected and actually one. How can you then feel alone? Our senses are playing a trick on us ;)|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Its natural to feel this way. Everyone is a loner to a degree. Even among your friends, you could still feel like you're alone. Its okay. It happens.
F8Tdrg3Waa	It sounds as if she's terrified of being left alone. Does she have friends at work or around the neighborhood?     You and your brother are adults. She can't prevent you from moving out, if that's what you need to do to move on. But you can visit regularly.    Unless she is sitting on a mountain of money for retirement and healthcare, she will need you to have a good job and your life together when she gets older. By going off to live your life , building a career, having a husband and family, you are not taking family away from her, you're increasing her family for the future.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	Well, my parents are the opposite.  They want me out of their house and can only complain that I am single still.  I am so upset that they are so negative sometimes.  It really breaks me up inside.  They attack me verbally for not doing what they want all the time.|`|qMun78M9aa	Honestly, I think she is asking too much. You said, "If I be a good daughter, then I give up my life." You aren't a bad daughter just because you don't stay with her your whole life. Everyone has the right to live their own life. Tell her how much you love her and want to be with her, but that you feel that you deserve to start your own life.|`|py7iFq0Vaa	She's just scared of losing you guys when you move on to have your own lives. Let her know that you'll still come and see her, but that you need your own space and want to get on with your life. Make sure to contact her a lot and go visit her, then hopefully she'll get used to the idea that you need your own life, and will try and support you instead of sabotaging it.  Good luck :)
zxa2fjpyaa	Be confident! Just start a casual conversation with him. Start off as being friends and then progress from there. If you have class with him just be like "hey ive noticed you in my class then blah blah blah(you make the rest up)" lol Then start talking to him casually everyday but that doesnt gurantee he will start liking you back but at least he knows you exist
jGKGlxAuaa	Depending on your grade; Yes.     There are many, many guys out there who are in their 20's and 30's who have yet to grow up.|`|2FBUx8bPaa	Yeah, thats why MOST girls choose to date older guys.  Boys mature slower then girls, so in order for a girl to be with someone on the same leval as her, she would need to date a bit older guys.  =)|`|TsFG4zLmaa	and how old are you??  i am 41 and i fart on my husband all the time, i don't announce it    kick their A**es and they will stop|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	LLmao, no, i'm in the stage.  But my boys are older.  And by boys i mean friends. Not lovers.|`|bEypuYJ0aa	uh, no. it never happened to me.  The guys in my grade are actually nice to me.  They do do things like that to some people though.  So I like them as in some are friend worthy, but none of them have any sliver of hotness. :)|`|EQydFhzmaa	I went to a school like that; now, not every boy was like this but it was a very big majority. Yes, it is normal. I also would wait until to even consider dating until they either mature, or new guys move there. :P|`|qLJnCj0Naa	Yes its completely normal!  Girls mature faster than guys.   So the guys on your grade are immature.   Just go for the guys in a grade older than you.  Sometimes they will be around your same maturity level.|`|cW1mq323aa	i think that only happends to nerds|`|06JnGkd9aa	Sure. I don't think I'll have a boyfriend until I'm twenty because I think guys are immature.|`|HvJpbTH8aa	some of my guy friends are like that.   tell them they are immature and make it seem like, or prove that everyone hates that about them. they will get embarrassed. its normal to think guys are immature...because they are. ?|`|5172f7acc2e1d638cd1863aaf0963b91aa	They sound totally immature.  Hopefully they will grow out of it.|`|d6wBfCvzaa	I hated pretty much everyone guys and girls in middle school. I even quit school cause I thought if I have to go to high school with this people Ill kill someone.     They didnt pick on me at all but i just hated them that much.|`|W618lfZ6aa	Totally natural, I didn't like anyone my own age when in middle/high school.  I was pretty mature for my age though, some slapstick comedy is nice, but they seem to be taking it too far.|`|2IBHMk9Naa	I have exactly the same problem, but it's only the boys at school, every other boy on the planet is more mature, but oh well, boys must be boys.|`|4tynRVpzaa	I think you're just a carpet muncher.|`|arXGZ9LMaa	haha totally, boys are immature, we all know that. Go for the older ones not in your grade :D|`|uXsqZLoiaa	its just boys being boys.|`|5jpY1RkKaa	Yes I think that's totally fine. Most boys are intolerable until 30 anyway.|`|fco4Hl2gaa	SUPER normal. And actually the wisest choice you could make. No point in getting all caught up with a boy you're not even going to stay with, especially when they're obnoxious. This has definitely happened to me many times, don't worry about it. Just wait til college, everything will seem to come together then :) You have so much to look forward to.|`|4xjOEHVNaa	LMAO OWOW YEP|`|5BBy6G36aa	Most of us guys are idiots.  Yes, I'm a straight guy and I'm saying that.  But eh, sounds like you might be in middle school (or an immature highschool) Just wait a few years, no need to rush.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Yeah, if they're like that I can't imagine them getting much action. Totally normal to dislike those kind of guys. They really need to grow up.|`|OCdsZC5daa	yeah thats normal!!!! your prolly young too. some of them get better when there older but i wouldent count on it to much. the good ones or the ones who love there moms and arnt afraid to say it.|`|LlxAgQXPaa	Hey.  We all have your own way of dealing with things like this, and if you think this is immature, (Wich it is) then you think that and ignore the Dudes.    If they are that vulgar and disgusting, and bully GIRLS, then seriously, its THEM with the problem.    :D  -     LiKE.DUDE.|`|1sA5pUV1aa	this is the very reason why girls date guys who are a year or two older, then the maturity level is the same. Guys are going to be inmature for your age reguardless of how old you get, they level off mid twenties, but they can be very inmature, sometimes even in a way that they think they are showing offf. Its the age|`|VJ6RfO4Yaa	ho ho ho yes! if i could name all the guys i hate in my grade, i'm sure mine would be pretty close to all of them too. i'm a senior though, and this year hasn't been so bad, i guess we all decided that we should be nice to each other because it's our last year together. trust me if you laugh along with it early, it will be much easier to stand their immaturity. they still do that and like i said, i'm a senior!!!|`|AA11381545	that is so normal.  I'm 25, and I still don't like people my age.  I always tend to date older men! Thanks completely normal, and don't let anyone tell you different.  In middle and high school, I never liked the boys in my grade.|`|m8ei49qMaa	yeah. ima senior and guys are like that even now. lol. either get over it or go for females or older guys. but no its not abnormal to dislike immature boys. but there are some great ones out there.|`|YqLSFc6yaa	Oh yes, boys can be like that. Just don't let them get to you. Just remember that you're way more mature than they are. Guys tend to act retarded around girls anyways. So i think you should try and find someone older and more mature that'll treat you good and show them what a real man is like, eh?!|`|6e0ab865a90b99b56f310ae0d55e1e11aa	Boys can be very immature! Yes it has totally happened to me before. But I have watched some of my most immature guy friends, become sincere, but funny teenagers. So, guys so eventually mature with age. Well, most do anyway.    =] ?|`|xwcpfSEdaa	generalization is never good|`|MjbLGaegaa	yeah all the time!   im still at schools and pretty much keep my distance from all the boys in my grade. i tend to go for older boys now, or ones that go to a different school.   i guess it is just boys being teenagers though!|`|azKi6dTDaa	yea its completely normal, sometimes boys can be dumb nd sometimes an older guy is better......|`|0k1y3Xn4aa	Hey (:  Yep, all the time. Some boys are just GROSS! They do it so their friends "Rate" them (Think they are cool), having no intentions what others think!  Annoying, huh?      Anyways, good luck!  :)    Lilmisshelperk
yLNsOJiQaa	I grew up as an only child.  I found it personally lonely.  My mom was a single parent and she worked from 7-5 M-F.  I had to walk to school and then be home alone till she got home which was around 5:30pm.  All of my friends had brothers/sisters or both.  I always envied them because they had some one always around whether they spoke or not.  They were never alone.    As for age, it really would not have mattered as long as we were a couple years apart.  Brother or sister either would have been fine.      My parents divorced when I was 6 and they are both remarried and have had kids with their significant others but I find it hard to feel a sister/sister connection because between one there is about 20 years difference and the other there is about 25 years difference.  Hell, if you want to get right down to it one of them is my son's age which is 9.     I get a bit envious of my husband when he is talking with his sisters on the phone because they laugh and cut up and I am unable to do that because I do not have any siblings around my age or that I can relate to .    I think that is why I have had at least two kids which are both boys.  This way they have each other and do not have to be alone.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	No, I have siblings.  It has it pros and cons.
764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Remember one thing, this is your party and whomever decides to come can participate in whatever they choose and if not, they're free to leave. You don't cater your party to meet everybody's standards. They have to conduct themselves to cater to you, to fit in. Otherwise, they can't come.     My husband and I used to throw swing parties and it was ALWAYS specified that if you felt uncomfortable participating, you were welcome to stay as long as you didn't stand out or make anyone else uncomfortable. It would be unfair to cater to them when there could actually be someone at the party who wants to enjoy all that you have to offer. You can't short change them.    Example: The very first swing party I ever went to, I was uncomfortable because I thought someone would recognize me. I realized that whomever would be there at the party, would be there with me so why feel uncomfortable. It's not like I brought the freak show to their house. They came out their house to the freak show. So, every since then- I try not to worry about what other people are doing. We don't throw parties anymore but if we did, that is how it would go. We wouldn't tone something down for the sake of someone there because everybody may not want things toned down.
w5KFkyGRaa	yes just ask them if they are in their class.
jdVxsK4yaa	u should mayb tlk bout da next class she has os da next one u have. usually skool is da easiest topic bcause u dont got2 thnk dat much. just talk bout teachers or da ppl u kno in dat class or watever. just take it from ther.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Just approach her. Start a conversation, try to be funny. Be easy going, friendly, smart and sweet. Just try to be her friend at first. Let her know that she has a cute smile:) and if she feels it too, in time you'll be a couple.
u1uECuFNaa	Yes. Although his excuse was he came home to run. I believed him. He ran...but not far.....went to a lot of trouble to prove that was why he was there though.   Best hour and a half of my life. (he showered and I took him back to work and picked up subs.) He told me was glad he was with me and wouldn't change it for the world.  Oddly enough, i was also pregnant.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	He better not be, seeing I am here at work!    LOL!|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I work and my husband stays home, so no that doesn't happen at my house.     I could never come home on my lunch break for a quickie because I know full well I wouldn't wanna go back to work. When I used to come home for something like that, I never went back and made up some excuse the next day. lol|`|BlVudiyfaa	I work from home, so I guess I do the same. Sometimes I ask her to vacuum naked.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No my husband cant leave work on his lunch break.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Good for you....lucky you|`|vFCva8R5aa	nope, i don't do that, maybe if we lived closer to our jobs we might     but it would really eat into his day to drive two hours home for lunch and then two hours back to work. So he would end up losing 4 hours of his 8 hour shift just to come home and have sex...    .... that would suck because then we would not be able to pay our bills and then we would lose our electricity and then we would have to forclose on our mortgage and the snowball effect from us just leaving work to get laid would be horrible.     soo not worth it in my opinion. lol     i only work a half hour away though. There is a woman at my job that her & her husband drive home almost everyday from work at lunch time to have sex and they have been together 11 years!|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	I wish... vigorous sexual activity can cause your water to break! Wait until you experience the family bond when baby is born..just gets better and better! Good for you!|`|L1SeinzRaa	Best lunch in town and the greatest diet plan ever.|`|IcnilUuUaa	Yes. My husband and I have been married for 8 years and he still does that.  We also have a child, but that does not stop us.  I appreciate it because I love being with him, and he obviously loves being with me.  There is nothing wrong with a healthy sexual appetite. Take care!|`|DptJXo7Caa	im sure lots of people do this. but don't complain- if you enjoy it then you are a lucky person with a healthy sex life that most likely wont lose its luster with this kind of spontaneity.    just be happy and if other couples dont actually do this too, then uhh... forget them. youve got it better|`|LxvA4vGpaa	He is military so he gets all those holidays that I don't get off (Martin Luther King, Columbus day, etc).   Those days I go home and get some afternoon nookie for lunch.      Unfortunately, it is a rare moment when he actually even has time for lunch at his desk let alone time for some lovins.|`|kM9xoajHaa	nope my husband waits until we are in bed at night|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Well..I've never done it but if you will leave a key under the mat I'll give it a whirl.|`|NGKwsawdaa	nope mine doesn't do that, but it's nice to know that your husband is thinking about you during the day and takes a break to come and see you...... and then have a quickie|`|3vbHZBioaa	Yes my husband does that for me...It's Great he can come home to satisfy you on his lunch break that's the kinda stuff that keeps marriages alive..Congrads on the new baby...Best of luck|`|1L1AxWoXaa	I miss those days. We have two kids now and we are usually too tired for anything. In answer to your question, before the muchkins yes we used to do stuff like that too.|`|yAZq4SLaaa	Congratulations on your baby and your life! YOU GO GIRL! My husband doesnt do that but he would if he could.. once he goes to work, he is there till quitting time! And you are right, alot will change when son comes, but ENJOY! for now..you lucky woman!|`|4e7396814e6ad0f7293c08e793cf2a20aa	yes, and its nice to be thought of during the day   if ur baby is due next week   enjoy it isnt easy once the kids are around|`|K8rv2f2Iaa	just have fun wth him  get it on  have fun and let him dig  it  in!!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yeah before we had kids, or even when they were babies, and back when he got lunch breaks.  Most days he works through lunch so he can come home earlier.  :)|`|evW18jvIaa	Today, actually! But in our case it was ME coming home for some action. :P    It's a great way to brighten up a dull workday!|`|wZaWDgeMaa	well.. its normal when both the person have desire to sex and more sex.. not in my case, i do wish that but she is not that on peak|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Lucky you!  used to be too far away before, but not now !  Not long now before baby is here, I am sure you are well prepared!  Enjoy every minute of your life, before & after the baby.
6de4e05c84e0f1dce65662bf0de02feeaa	I definately agree with you there.|`|iwPGvzskaa	Yes. I wish someone would tell me they love me and mean it|`|4npjIcPaaa	definately odd.
ECvEknqtaa	if it was as a joke i dont think u should worry(it was a joke alright!)  and just make sure he is ok with that. i dont mean go right up to him and ask him but just sort of talk to him and ull know if he still is talking to you and stuff. gd luck|`|aNIiGpzeaa	i dont necessarily think it was wrong, but, i dont think it was well thought out or controlled of you to do that|`|iIcNQ1H9aa	i think you should talk to him tomrow and just be like yo wat waz wrong with u yeastersay
2gV7TDkAaa	Wow...Exactly a year ago I met my biological dad for the first time! I was deeply hurt and traumatised afterwards:( Did you have any contact with them like email phone calls, etc?    Just think a lot about it...it's not always like in the movies...    good luck    My mom I'm still waiting to meet her...|`|qQu57aWdaa	perfect, I'll pray for you.
eO4y3m1maa	Did you order it from a huge company? Or a catalog and not directly thru the site? If so contact those people..      otherwise call seventeen
QczEdd5qaa	Revenge is a sweet thing    but if you do it...you will just hurt yourself....    Oh but Karma will help you.....    you can also cry and move on.....|`|3wFt9fyZaa	Cry.  Then move on and dont contact her again.|`|xxiX1qQgaa	Well, just live your life and forget about her, she doesn't woth it, you are a better person than her.
zjNidefBaa	He likes you, seriously.    He is flirting with you using the teasing method.     It's quite a good one actually.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	He definitely like you.
hLWy1evQaa	Short answer: yes.     It really depends on his level of commitment and how religious he is. My boyfriend is Catholic (so am I), and he grew up in a militant Catholic Household. BUT, he isn't very religious and after a few dates, we kissed, which eventually moved on to making out and fooling around which eventually became all out sex.     If he is extremely Catholic and wants to wait for marriage, he probably will be less likely to have sex. But, in truth, those guys are few and far between.     Don't be in such a rush to have sex though. Appreciate him taking things slow, and savor it. Guys like that are rare and he must really like you. Once you reach the next level, it changes things (for better or worse depending on the relationship) and you can never go back to those early days when everything was new and exciting.     Relationships get better with age, but it takes time to get to know someone. The better you know them, the better and more meaningful the sex will be.|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	some do, some don't.  I sure did, once I got over all the crap the church forced into my head, and man, was I much better off once I started having sex.  Yahhoooooooo!!!!1|`|cW1mq323aa	i came from a catholic school.. ive done drugs, had sex, fought. im sure im not the only one..    usually christians are the one who dont do that stuff|`|ZJZunlU0aa	I'll just say this, my husband is catholic and we had 2 kids before we got married, so that should answer your question however not all guys are the same.|`|56n8oUvjaa	Haha, One of em lost their V to me...yea, sorry but all men are sexual, and if they're not they will tell you straight up.|`|wEr1YApRaa	Sounds to me like your interested in him messing up the bed sheets with you.  Kinda funny you've only been on two dates and this is what your worried about lol|`|izbAdDUraa	the ones i knew sure did...|`|SsfnitjXaa	I dated a catholic boy .. it took 32 dates before I got a kiss and even that I initiated it.  My guy was very shy and inexperienced (not that I had any experience, but I did know how to kiss).   It is not good to date a shy guy because you are always have to take the lead in sex stuff and they are always over compensating by being too bossy outside the bedroom.|`|k1FenuRLaa	don't set ur heart on having any sex of any kind before u marry shud u choose to and try not to pressurize him into doing so.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	not if their devoted catholics|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	If he follows what the bible says than he'll wait till marriage. Cause that's a special gift you can give your husband/wife. And then you don't have to worry about diseases, or unwanted (teenage)pregnancy's. Then you will be doing what God wants you to do. Wait till your married, cause that's a real commitment. Not like just dating.|`|cHM2US6xaa	HAHAHAHA OF COURSE THEY DO !|`|J9X9B6y9aa	Most christians (including myself) have a hard time practicing what we are preached. XD|`|M63kq3AYaa	Religion is full of hypocrisy and lies.  So although he might promise to his God and priest that he'll live a good Catholic life, he'll be lying through his teeth and doing what the rest of us do.|`|tMsCXngvaa	not if hes TRUELY catholic and believes FULLY in his religion. and u should respect him for that if he is! =] |`|ilbMPWmzaa	jump on his lap, you'll get an answer soon enough|`|aIHSmRYwaa	Trust me, yes they do. Young guys do not care about religion when it comes to sex.|`|AA10030560	ya they sucked on their mother's nipples when they were born.. other than that.. I dont think so.
sjvdbDn9aa	Britt, you have many opportunities in the Navy to go on with your schooling.I would just tell your mom your feeling,tell her all the pros of going in the navy.How it would make you feel.And sometimes in life you have to do the things you want even though it might not make someone happy.Live for today,you don't want to look back on your life,and be disappointed on what you didn't do.JD|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Tell her that you still are considering completing college but you want to jon the Navy.  Explain the education benefits GI Bill !00% paid tuition & books, & and $1500.00 monthly living expense.|`|0c0ywvuRaa	that isnt a bad thing. atleast youd still be doing sumthing great with ur life! and they will pay for you to go to school later!  just tell her how you feel. shes ur mom shell understand and probably be really proud you wana fight for your country.
d4f7a89688a581eea0b65f858f25f2daaa	Yes normal - you are chasing him... he has no need to call - he KNOWS you will call. You are acting too needy.    Back off - don't call     How long will it be till he calls?  He will say "What is the matter" you have not called....       A relationship is balance - too much of anything will upset the balance - you need to find out how much he likes you - does he want you, need you??     Good Luck|`|qISeJl3Naa	I don't care!  Good bye.        :(    From    oswaldeugene@yahoo.com|`|08y217Rdaa	You have switched the roles it seems. Does he wear skirts?|`|ZbXiw5gdaa	tell him something like ( hey i think its cute when you text/call me )  sometimes it just doesn't enter guys minds that they need to be the ones to call or text.   i don't know if its normal but as long as you guys are talking its ok...
eO4y3m1maa	Im confused just by reading this.    Appeal what?
913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	It is true of some (speaking from my own experience) It took me years to realise I was attracted to the wrong things in men. I learnt too late !!!|`|izbAdDUraa	Not at all.  most women (young or old) go for idiots.  i like to refer to those idiots AS MEN. :]|`|mimykKnhaa	yes. I am 22 and my bf is NOT an idiot.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	No, it's kind of true. And that's because younger girls haven't fully developed their priorities and goals in life, and eventually they figure that out and find a guy who meets their needs. That's why I always tell these guys, "Nice guys might finish last, but at least they end up with the girl."|`|BjQcwGSLaa	yeah, they date somebody like themselves|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	Nope. I dated jerks until I was 25.|`|fIWzTzfFaa	You COULD say that but I think it's women of all ages with low self-esteem and a lack of self- confidence that makes them feel they don't deserve any better than the idiots and jerks that approach them, get with them and then treats them like sh*t.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	yes|`|qLJnCj0Naa	yes but a lot that I know do! lol!|`|M7lOK6DWaa	yes because im 18 and my boyfriend is extremely nice and you can tell hes not lying when he says he loves me. there are a lot of women out there who would rather go for a jackass without realizing it though. I've been with a few and it was not fun. Got lucky with this one though.|`|783Ve5Pnaa	Yes, but, sadly, it is true..|`|aIHSmRYwaa	It's not wrong.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	It  appears it is only stereotypical to you, I haven't heard others ever say that about younger women.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	no, i don't think they at first do it intentionally, i think that they all want the same thing at first, but they just decide to look for it in the wrong places. and from then on, it is all they know. they go for the idiots. we get better as we progress though, well those of us who really want to. some girls like the idiots, for god knows why. so, yes, it is stereotypical. it is not intentional. it is just that when we are younger, most of the boys are idiots. and those of us that don't try not to, continue to go for them.|`|BMhPpnuMaa	yes|`|oxuSiBwxaa	Im going out with a beautiful lady who is younger than me and im not an idiot..|`|RcZ6MEzBaa	It's a stereotype that is also true like 75% of the time.|`|lyNgNpRgaa	Yes, but remember...there's a reason behind stereotypes.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	younger as in what age group?? teens? or mid twenties?|`|Yg51SGlsaa	nope. i think that way too. though i am 21 and i think all people younger than me do that. Some people my own age do that too.    It's just nature i guess until we figure out that we don't want the idiots we want the other guys.|`|0aW15UFGaa	YES.. but... a lot of younger girls do, its a lerning process. this is equaly to  a lot of young men go withs sluts, not every one tho!|`|oFUqegjfaa	I get what you're saying.  You're just wording it incorrectly.  It would be an over generalization. It's not true for ALL of them.  Some young girls go for young guys.  Young sometimes equals less educated.|`|2FoMlJnLaa	Terribly steretypical    and unfortunately totally true.|`|Rkt8tnUzaa	not horridly sterotypical lolz    cuz in some cases that is true, others not so much.     depends on the person really. some people are clueless others are not, with the occasional in betweens who are'nt sure what they want.    all in all it is sterotypical, yet it has truth behind it.    not saying all of us go for idiots lolz, but some do because of looks, or what ever    eventually they figure out that their not right for them   its just some of us learn the hard way    well you live and you learn   life goes on =]|`|FyhzmgRUaa	who knows.|`|4cJZ3SIWaa	No it is not.    Men and women can be characterized by certain traits and behaviours. Not all women will go after those type of guys but let us be honest. We have millions of years of evolution that is hard wired in us to choose the best mate for us. So women tend to choose Alpha males. It's just facts. Weak men just don't cut it.|`|4eLLjTzzaa	Okay, I laughed out loud when I read this!  Horridly stereotypical? As in, global or terrifying?  Younger women? Younger than what?  Idiots?  Like people with low I.Q.'s or people who don't practice any common sense, or people who take advantage of weaknesses in others?    I wouldn't even know where to start with this!  Sounds like somebody (a younger woman) stepped on your relational toes while she was dancing with some "idiot" and you want to know if you should expect this from other women.      Your question demonstrates a highly global approach to language/relationships/life.  You need to expand your education and find a safe person to talk to about your hurt.|`|EkLJDcc7aa	yea|`|GfG4PfjMaa	I think you knew the answer to this when you wrote it.    The fact that they are young says they have little or no experience on how to choose a person to be in a relationship with.    Some young people have an insight and some don't.  We all looking for that something that is special to us.    What one person sees in another we may never see.      My concern is that you are looking too hard with an opinion as what they are choosing and should be redirecting your energy toward what you are want or are choosing.     You point the finger at someone and someone is also pointing a finger at you.    Keep the focus on you and relax your judgment of others.  What may appear an idiotic choice to you, may in fact be genius to another.    It's their life, their choice.   Idiot, fool, crybaby, nerd, punk, gay, genius or what ever flaws you may endow upon them....If they happen with them, I'm happy for them.|`|ruczpWrGaa	kind of.  only because they haven't experienced life and learned from their mistakes.|`|q1pwHXrMaa	It is stereotypical but I agree with it at times.|`|1VLIB4Cyaa	no....most of the time its true.  I dated some pretty idiotic guys when I was younger.  But thats because most young guys are idiots!
TJiGs8S4aa	I'm so sorry you are in this position.  You must feel very confused and betrayed.  However, here's what I think is going on: he is in a very awkward position relative to you, and as bad as you feel, I hope you can try to understand it from his perspective.  He has no formal relationship to you, apart from the relationship he forged with you when he was with your mom.  He sounds like a stand-up guy to have continued to see you for *five years* after they broke up.  I don't think it is that he doesn't care about you - I think it is more that, now he has his own son, his wife may be making noises about having you around - and since he has no formal legal obligation or tie to you, he is in no position to push that issue - but he doesn't want to hurt your feelings, so he makes a vague excuse and just kind of pushes you off.  It would be better if he were up-front about it, and talked to you enough to say that he has been there for you for a long time, but now he is in a position where he can't easily continue to do that - but he is just doing the avoidance routine.  I'm guessing he is trying to keep you at arm's length because of his new life.  It is very sad for you - because you could probably even accept the fact that he has a new life, because he has given you so much more than anyone could have required him to do, but he has not given you the ability to achieve any kind of closure since he hasn't talked to you.      You might want to try writing him a letter that addresses what I've said here - and ask him to tell you straight out what is motivating his actions, and tell him that you don't fault him for his choices, whatever they are, but you would like closure.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	i'm sorry to hear that...  the reason he's acting this way is because he now has a family of his own and his OWN child for the first time and is busy w/ his wife and his new family. he has responsibilities and unfortunately doesn't have any time for you.    i know it's hard, but i'd let it go because he has his own life now and you can still be friends, but he's not with your mom anymore so the relationship has pretty much ended...    try reconnecting w/ your real dad, i think that's what you need, a father figure, and which better one than your own.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I would confront him and expect to get hurt. sounds as if he don't care. then jet it go and move on, do not let this effect your life babe you deserve so much more then that.|`|9iUiImTVaa	You should go see him and tell him how you feel, or call him until he answers. When you do get a hold of him, you need to tell him how badly you've been hurt. Just tell him everything you feel.  Good luck. I hope I helped(:|`|JpXiKJ8Aaa	I would tell your mom you want to see him and that means a lot to you, and when you get there tell him you need to talk to him and tell him how he hurt you and that you still want to see him.|`|7yeghtnaaa	well i kinda went though the same thing but with my REAL dad .. my parents split and now he has another family and never has time for me .. it has been over a year..   so heres what i have to tell you just give him some space and just send him a simple letter with a new picture of you in it , ask him how hes doing and thats it .. when he gets the letter and see the picture he will realize how much he has missed and how much he misses you!    hope i helped!

J5xSGi2maa	Well the 1st thing is he said  "cuz i miss u?" had a question mark @ the end because he probably thought you already knew that and was supprised that You didnt figure that out.....It wasnt wrong of you to be honest with him because it sounds to me like your just being carefull not to get hurt and your just making sure nothing goes wrong....if you say that he doesnt want to have sex then mayb the only real reason he wants to see you is because he simply has feelings for you and he is trying to get back with you...but in the end the choice is yours weather or not you want to get back with him...its obv he wants to get back with you

Kon7LCLKaa	You know I stayed home with my daughter for 2 years and my husband was the same way. He would always say nasty things to me and say that the money is his because he is the one that earns it. I finally got tired of it and for about a week I did nothing. I didn't cook dinner, didnt do the dishes every night, didnt wash clothes ( and he wears uniforms to work) and didn't pick up after my daughter either. He finally saw what all I do while he is gone and that without me he whole world would crumble. Try it, it works.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I am married and a stay at home mom.  My husband cooks, helps keep the house clean and helps out with the kids as much as he can.  He understands that being a stay at home mom is a full time job and he 100% loves me, respects me, and admires me for doing what I do every day.    There is a great book about love and respect.  It has a biblical basis, but even if you are not religous, it is a very good book.  It is called "Love & Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately Needs"      The basis of the book is this:  Women need love to feel fulfilled.  They expect unconditional love form their spouse.  Men need respect to feel fulfilled, but many of them do not know it.  And believe it or not, men need unconditional respect.  There is a vicious cycle that goes on; when a man feels disrespected, he reacts without love, and when a woman feels unloved, she reacts with disrespect.      The good news is that it takes just one person to break the cycle.  Try telling your husband out of the blue and offhandedly that you were thinking today that there are a lot of things you respect about him.  And have a few things ready to go because he WILL ask what they are.  He'll be very interested.  And when he feels respected, he will react with love towards you.  It's pretty amazing how that works.    As far as him believing that he's above you because he works outside the home, that's an easy fix.  Two things:    1.  Stop doing the things that you do every day, stop cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, etc.  Just stop.  Only do what is necessary for you and the children to live.    2.  When he has a couple of days off, tell him that you have made plans to go somewhere with friends/family (go to your moms or go see a friend, something for you and have fun.  Do make sure that he can reach you in case of an emergency or in case he cannot handle it) and tell him that he needs to watch the kids and leave him a list of everything that is to be done.  Including housework, play/learning time with the kids, baths, bedtime stories, all of it.  Stay gone for about 24 hours.  That'll be long enough for him completely respect what you do.  Trust me.  :)    I leave my husband alone with the kids for a couple hours while I go to the store or whatever and he is very thankful when I come home and tells me that he can handle all these privates (he's a soldier) and going to combat but he cannot handle the house and the kids.  :)|`|sspuxjyraa	A husband here who has done this to his wife.  Why did I do this?  All the time I knew how hard she was working and how difficult her life was with the kids.  Yet, I was upset about being bombarded with criticism and complaints.    I did a bad job communicating, and instead of letting her vent and being an empathetic selfless listener, I just decided on my own to try to help her.  I started really busting my *** trying to help clean, to do laundry, put the kids to bed every night, etc.  This did not help at all.      In hindsight, we could have both done things better.  She should have made it clear to me that she appreciated the things I was doing for the family (job, helping at home, etc).  And I should have listened better, been more empathetic, and told her how much I appreciated her own sacrifices.  I should have discussed what I could do to help, rather than just go and do it on my own.  We should have made more time for each other as well, even though it is tough to do with young kids.    For you I would consider a couple months of counseling.  It's not an admission of failure to get help, but it could really make a difference.  Take it from a man who may have learned from his own mistakes too late.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	no you are ok to vent this out!    I was a stay at home mom for 12yrs-- The worst thing my husband would say ( on a daily basis) is  you need to do this/that""since you have nothing better to do"...............FIGHT STARTER COMMENT!    now I say this to him every now and then.....Since you have nothing better to do..go fold some laundry,get the car washed etc...

I would think that he is doing something behind your back and taking the guilt out on you cause he is not man enough to let you know. Might want ot check up on him when he says he is at work. Put the kids in daycare and get you a job so when he decides to trest you like that you got some money to get out. Trust me he is up tp no good and i wish you luck.|`|IHjevhjhaa	What up girl? Hey I'm actually a husband, and I agree with you. Its tough for a man to see your side without walking in your shoes.     Does he know how your feel? If he doesn't, than have fun with an experiment and have him take 2 or 3 days off. Then take on all your responsibilities and see how that works out for him. Then pick out the things he missed and call him out on them.     Hope it all works out and God bless you guys!|`|AA11496842	I'm a stay at home wife and my husband doesn't dare treat me like that. If people want me to respect them, they better respect me.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,     While there is a give and take to both of these emotions, the primary thing Men want is RESPECT. Respect travels upwards from a subordinate position. You respect your parents. You respect your superiors. You respect the law.     Now while respect is nice and dandy, it is also conditional. A Man who does not EARN RESPECT, gets none. He knows he has to be an admirable man in order to gain your respect (which is love to him). He wants to be your hero. He wants to protect and provide for you. And he wants that recognition.    ADORATION flows downward. Parents adore their children. You adore the young and flighty. They make mistakes and cause problems....but you shrug it off and keep adoring them.     ADORATION is unconditional. You need only a) receive that adoration and b) return it with admiration and respect.    Now, by far and large, when Women think of love....they're actually thinking about ADORATION. How would you react if your husband said "Well, if you don't get up today, I won't love you anymore!" or "If you can't lift that heavy box, my love for you will diminish!"?    These actions diminish RESPECT.....they shouldn't diminish ADORATION. Rather, they should elicit concern (Are you sick dear? Are you tired? How can I help?).    All the gifts women enjoy receiving (flowers, chocolates, cards, clothes, cosmetics, jewelry) have little or no functional use. They are, rather, signs of ADORATION.     The gifts men enjoy are almost entirely functional (tools, food, car accessories, guns, knives). In fact, if you don't buy him a tool...he begins to doubt that you respect him.    Try buying a woman a vacuum cleaner if you want real trouble.     With regards to your situation:     You've got your priorities all mixed up. You're demanding RESPECT. You're rejecting his ADORATION. You find it insulting (though I can't imagine why).    This has led him to treat you like another male. When the Beta dog barks at the Alpha dog, there is going to be a fight. So he's becoming aggressive. He's admonishing you "respect has to be earned".    This does not mean you've done nothing important. To the contrary, I'm sure your contributions to the family are considerable. What he is ACTUALLY saying is "Get out of my territory!!", meaning accept his adoration, return with respect.     "no excuse to talk down to or belittle someone you are supposed to love and be equal to"    Be equal to....    Yes, men and women are equal. But that does not mean they are the same. Men and women are peanut butter and jelly. Great combination! NOTHING LIKE EACH OTHER AT ALL.     Different flavors, textures, origins, consistencies, smells, colors....nothing more different in the world. Yet nothing tastes better side by side.    Rather than attempting to fight your husband as a male (trying for respect), encourage him to adore you. There is a reason mothers get flowers and jewelry on Mother's Day....and dads get a tie or some cigarettes (not even their own brand).     So, enough conflict. Show him your love through respect, generosity, support, understanding, and sympathy. Heal his wounds and he'll stop treating you like a pesky beta-male, and start treating you like the most important woman on the planet.     Because, to him, you will be.    Good Luck!|`|5k7BexD3aa	I don't work and my husband doesn't treat me like that.  He always treats me equal and even helps around the house.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I don't like my boss either, but the paycheck is good.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	You are right, he cannot expect you to respect him if he doesn't respect you.    Apparently he hasn't earned his respect either.    And yes, you can still feel hatred towards someone you love, I've been there before.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Stop doing EVERYTHING.  Do not clean the house  Do not do laundry  Do not go grocery shopping  etc......  Then let him say you are just a "stay at home mom'    What a major Jack@ss he is!|`|6taNabssaa	Being a SAHM is a job.  It is the hardest job I have ever done.  There is no sick time, no vacation and no time off.  You are up before the children and go to bed after they do.  There is all of the cleaning of the house, laundry, grocery shopping, errands, taking the kids to doctors appointments etc.  You know...you are there.      Your husband needs to realize that too.  It is not a party everyday.  He may have to punch a time-clock but you are on-call 24-7.  There is no lunch break without the kids for you, not to mention trying to go to the bathroom without a little one banging on the door.  What about all of this does not earn respect?      Does he think you need to go to work and leave the kids with a sitter?  Maybe with the economy right now in the toilet he thinks you need to be bringing home a paycheck.  Not that that is an excuse to act like you are beneath him, because you are not.        And yes, it is possible to feel resentment toward him and still love him, he is the man you married.  Just a tool.  Gool luck.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I think you are right. If your husband is making you feel like he is "better" than you because he is the breadwinner, he should be reminded that a marriage is a partnership...and a wife has the same level or rank he has. She is by no means "inferior" or "less" than he is.    Unfortunately, money is important in life. And in many societies, the one who makes the money - or has the money- tends to control things. Money means power, it means freedom.     Why do you think most abusive men don't want their wives to study or have a job? Because it would make them stronger, and less willing to accept their abuse! A lot of women stay in toxic relationships because they don't have the cash to leave and start afresh somewhere else...Sad, really.    I guess your husband needs to be reminded of all the things you do around the house. Make a list and have it ready for him to see the next time he starts acting this way. Remind him you TAKE CARE of precious things he has...like a HOME and his KIDS!    Perhaps you might consider getting a part-time job later on. You would beel a lot better about yourself if you did. Good luck.     (( As an elderly lady once said to me: " Never give a man all of your love, nor all of your money". Smart lady...!  ))|`|OG4410bdaa	I'm sorry honey  I too am a stay-at-home wife, a student, and a mom-to-be (due next week)  however my husband never belittles me    in fact  he goes out of his way on a daily basis to thank me for the things I do everyday anyway  I pack his lunch for work: he calls home to say "thank you for including this or that"  I cook dinner from scratch: he gives me a kiss and says "thank you it was delicious"  I lay out his uniform for him (he's in the military): he writes me a note "thank you for taking such good care of me"    I'm so sorry for the way he makes you feel  no woman deserves that  especially not a woman who has strong family values, who takes care of her family as first priority  you've earned my respect for choosing to stay-home, and its a shame that he does not respect you the way he should- the way you have earned|`|dnFpyyMSaa	Hey Sweety,  Just in case you have not figured it out yet, he is supporting, you, your child and the house. He is the reason you get to stay home and think about how much work you do being at home.    So you have a few choices, give him the respect he earns every day by going to work OR get your butt to a job where you make your own support. When you end up living like the other single mothers who have to work  take care of the house and children without benefit of a husband and his income you can start to demand some respect. Until then you are just another user who thinks a lot of her position but does not appreciate her status.      Learn to be happy with your lot.  The alternative is not so bright.    It is all well and good to think that you are doing some great service to the family by being at home and raising a baby.  What you do not understand is that it is not that big a deal.   If it takes you more than 20 hours a work week to take care of the house and child you are doing something wrong.   Add a 40 hour work week and commuting to what you do now  and maybe you have something to complain about.   Until then quit your whining.    Working mothers are not at all sensitive to your plight.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	i know how you feel. i been there.  i agree with you. if he does not respect you then you can not give it back in return.   my ex treated me the same way even when i started working . he said everything is his cause he made more than me. when i was not working he said i was lazy. I cooked cleaned did all the yard work and shoveled the snow from the driveway.   Is it possible to love someone and feel hatred for them at same time.  demand that he respects you.  start making him do stuff for himself. i stopped cooking for my ex and i stopped cleaning his house. i told him it is your house you clean it.  I am now remarried to someone else. I lost my job so now i take care of a 4 yr old. he gives me support and respect.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	No, you're not.

They will just end up unhappy and unsatisfied with a girl who is so gaga over him, that she breaks the norm, asks him out, and he says, "that was easy.  I just sat on my tush." instead of a hot girl he persues.  Is it because girls reject too many persuers?  'Cause I think it's hot when a guy takes charge, and it makes me overlook other stuff that's not so great about him.  It's flattering.    How I want it to happen is this:  A guy I would probably not ask out myself, thinks I'm something great and asks me out.  I get to know him, fall in love with his great personality, and he with mine and my looks, and we live happily ever after.  I ended it like this because I think of it as a fairy tale.

YpDTLvI0aa	Hola  pues mira chica lo mas sano es ke por el momento no te comproemtieras con ninguno, date tu tiempo para conocerlos asi veras ke sucede o mas bien realmente ke te hace sentir mejor,  ahora si kieres seguir con tu novio, pero tambien te kieres divertir ,pues dile lo ke te gusta hacer, a donde ir todo esto, no siempre el deside ke hacer, tu tamiben participa en la relaciiion,   siempre pense ke la relacion de novios es para conocerse, salir,pelearse, amarse,   ahora , el otro chico sabe  ke tiene novio? ,si lo sabes, ke anda buscando en ti ?,  sabes, todos los chicos cuando les interesa una persona hacen hasta lo imposible por sorprenderla, pero con el tiempo se pierde el interes|`|u5tFehASaa	te digo una cosa simplemente no quieres a tu novio, porque si le quisieras no tendrias la tentacion con la otra persona, ahora si quieres divertirte prueba con los dos.|`|NB6Lo2Z5aa	Quedate con el que te sientas feliz, asi de simple.

OYE!!! ACUERDATE Q T PUEDES KEDAR COMO EL PERRO D LAS DOS TORTAS, ASI COMO M PASO A MI, ASI Q DECIDETE YA!!!!!!!!

Yo tome mi desicion tomando en cuenta con cual me la pasaba mejor pero sobre todo cual era el que m demostraba mas cari?o, el que mas m queria a mi; porque solo ponte a pensar con quien t querarias con el q t quiere o con quien tu quieres. M di cuenta que en realidad entre mi novio y yo no habia nada ni confianza ni cari?o como la iba a haber si ni siquiera nos veiamos ni saliamos para conocernos mejor entonces deci terminarlo y darme una oportunidad con mi galan, que ahora es mi novio, y vieras q bien me siento conmigo misma mas q nada ademas estoy totalmente convencida q a quien quiero en realidad es a mi actual novio, ya que una relacion implica conocerse a fondo y disfrutar el momento q pasas con el. Asi q tu toma tu desicion en base con quien te sientes mejor, el que t demuestre q en realidad t quiere ok y suerte.|`|4iCs2oeBaa	Bueno amiga pues piensa muy bien lo que vas a hacer y deja de estar jugando con ambos, tienes que tomar una decisin o te quedaras sola ok. Suerte!!|`|AA10760130	Mira pues si piensas que no quieres atu novio entonces date una oportunidad con aquel muchacho pero si quieres atu novio no lo dejes por nada del mundo por que despues te puedes arrepentir. Asi que yo que tu mejor ablava con tu novio y le diria que por que no salen tu savez platicar bien. Bueno mucha suerte y piensalo bien. Saludes.|`|tw6JBKBOaa	?Y por qu no probs con los dos hasta que te decidas?|`|ee5b25a11da4d666ab1e4e5214390f5aaa	digo que por el que sali al ltimo... pero antes cort con tu novio, no seas canalla.|`|200kYp6kaa	Pues yo creo que tal vez estas confundida, lo que puedo decirte es que tenga mucho cuidado con lo que haces, a lo mejor tu novio no tiene la posibilidad economica para sacarte a pasear, pero si de verdad lo quieres creo que eso es lo que menos importa, aqui lo mas importante es que te sienta agusto con l, que lo quieras y que te sientas rrespondida, tal vez lo que te llama la atencion del otro chico es que te saca a pasear, pero piensa bien  lo  que haces. hace como 2 a?os tnia un novio que era de la escuela y sentia que de verdad me queria, pero al mismo tiempo q salia con el m invito a salir otra persona, era mayor que yo y me llamaba mucho la atencin, cuando me di cuenta cai redondita con el otro tipo, hice cosas de las que me arrepenti demasiado tarde, deje al que era mi novio y m, di cuenta que el otro lo unico que queria era verme la cara y cai, afortunadamente el que era mi novio nunca me dejo, seguiamos como amigos y me di cuenta que de verdad me queria, termine con la otra relacion y regrese con mi novio hasta ahora ya llevamos  dos a?os juntos y somos muy felices, estoy segura que nos amamos. Toma la mejor desicin y que tengas mucha suerte.Si de evrdad quieres a tu novio y sientes que l tambin te quiere, hchale ganas a la relacion.

6cm6MB66aa	I agree with just about everyone ells . Don't marry the woman until she gets her kid under control . You know as well as i do she isn't going to let you correct her son . All your going to be in that family is the bad guy or the one everyone steps on . You can see what kind of parent she is cant you ? Is that the kind of woman your looking for ?|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Then don't marry his parent.|`|AA12188347	If he's that bad there are only two things you can do.....    1. deal with it as kids are a package deal.  You want Momma you got the kids with...maybe you could be a positive influence and teach him to respect people and that sort of thing.    2.  Forget it and go your own way.  Do not marry the Momma if you arent willing to deal with and help care for, teach and nurture the son.  Its just not right or fair for anyone.    PS how old is this boy anyway?  just curious if he is young enough to be able to teach and reverse the attitude and behavior or old enough to just stick it out his last few years......|`|GeruGGOQaa	Don't make him your step son.  Kids are a package deal so unless you're thinking you can change him (that's usually what women think they can do with men and are always surprised when they can't) don't get married.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Do not marry his mother.  It will be hell for all involved.  You will likely divorce over this issue.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	He comes with the mother - as a package.  You need to determine with his mother if you will be allowed  to discipline him after you are married.|`|AA10776535	Don't get married he is part of the package.|`|gapWTVmDaa	Tell him that one day he will be in your skin ;)|`|TJGje2blaa	You should turn & run away, cause there is no way his parent will side with you, & your life will be miserable.   It's better to remain dating him, than to jump into a bed of fire ants.|`|EGR9qgvXaa	Don't get married unless you talk to your GF about her son.  Tell her what you expect.  You have every right to voice your opinion and concerns since you will now be a part of the family.  Lucky for you, you realized it now.  I didn't realize my SS was a lazy spoiled punk *** until after we were married and I moved in.  I'm dealing with it now and it sucks!|`|tsBL19qzaa	Don't get married. It's a package deal, and if you can't stand part of the package, save yourself some future trouble and end the relationship.|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	Well, it's not like he's going to be hidden in a closet after you marry.  So, you better get some pre-marital counseling and come to some agreement on how you're going to handle this.
2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	My hubby and I watched the movie last weekend.  We thought it was very good. Although I think that some people who are not Christian may be turned off by it.  However, it does make a valid point--that is to say that God should be in your marriage and that if He is there, marriages can be saved. We've only been married 5 months, but after seeing the movie we went to buy "The Love Dare" workbook that goes along with it. Just so we can keep things on the right track. I can see that the movie would be very helpful in marriage seminars or counseling. And if someone truly wants to save a marriage, that watching the movie would help open up discussions.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	It's a safe bet that all the questions are posted by the people selling the book.    It's a promotional gimmick.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Kirk Cameron, is that you???|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Good question.  I'd really like to know how a MOVIE can save a marriage?   Patiently waiting on responses...    Just what is in this movie that is so revealing?|`|SiniSj1eaa	why has this question been asked like 234987324743298723 times today??|`|xszqbAFXaa	That was a great movie! I am married and we went to see the movie and both really thought it was a good movie.  I think that for a movie to have such a positive theme, and message to be so popular is absolutely wonderful! It is a movie that could probably save some marriages, espicially with the books "Fireproof" and  "The Love Dare" are in stores now. It is a movie that says with God in your marriage you will be alright.|`|nqcnylFpaa	anything with kirk cameron in it i don't want to see it he is a terrible actor plus there is only one good fire fighter movie and that ladder 49   plus my marriage is fine because i love my wife plus we have one thing in common and that is resident evil and that i am a atheist and she is a buddhist|`|qJzPQWDqaa	OMG! YES!! i definelty recommend watching it. It helped my parents marrige and like saved my sisters. Its an amazing movie, just puts things in perspective. Definelty watch it. Im thinking of making my BF watch it|`|a804958f4ae350dd48a19bd98ba830a5aa	It may be a little (ok more than a little) sappy but it is a great movie! Never hurts to try it if you are out of all other ideas and you really want to make it work.   It has not been out that long so I am sure no one really knows if it will save a marriage, yet.|`|qUbv1ln4aa	A lot of churches are doing the study that goes along with it and some are even going as far as requiring the couple who wants to be married in their church to watch the movie and take the course it has already made people realize in some cases that they shouldn't be together in most others though it lets most people know how they should be towards each other and what God expects from them I recommend it for everyone and its funny also
ZKCARV7faa	Um.. I think you should be patient and wait it out. Kinda play hard to get. If he really does like you like that he might actually go after you. But I'm not totally certain. So... hope this helps!|`|3d7b5d3c6e987e4196411aba3060f1b6aa	well, he's already going out with someone...  try not to be too attached to the boy because you will miss the other guys in the world|`|AA12133720	If he is dating someone, just let it be. if he wants u instead, he'll leave d other girl and ask u out. so just act normal and not desperate and things wuld work out.|`|89c68d5a8f6f7732fa413061b9fa311baa	I agree with the person above ( 1) because if he did like you, he would ask you out. But maybe he likes you, but can't ask you out because then he would have to dump his girlfriend, and he doesn't want any of you guys to get hurt. But, if he looks at you in a certain way, then I'm positive that he likes you. Just play hard to get, like what  1 said|`|628ab997df6e9db8764625c4433a6fbfaa	ur in a very tough situation....ur clueless. try asking some of his frends what he thinks about u. get one of ur frends to talk to him or his frends. there's only one way ur gonna figure out if he likes u, and thats asking questions. info on guys and dating below.|`|AA11145682	maybe he given u a signal good luck i hope dat u an him will 1 day get together
BcrYBSJmaa	Probably but he sounds like a bit of a player, maybe a bit of fun, but not someone to get serious with.|`|5owT5hjWaa	He is probably not that into you. Sorry but i have seen this happen to one of my friends. She liked this guy and he kept giving her signs, like compliments and hanging out with her most of the time. I told her to ask him out, and she did. Big mistake, he said he was just being nice to her and he didn't really like her in that way, just as friends. So yeah, But if you really think he is into you go ahead and ask him out.|`|96zZlJVYaa	you stated that he has a girl friend. then its best of you to leave him along. sound like you're about to get caught up into something you will be boo woo later about. sure he sending you signal that he likes you, that is all it about all. word of wisdom; hottie or not leave him along.
TBbdRz8Naa	Con los pies en la tierra y la mente en las estrellas    As me siento desde que llegaste a mi vida    y ahora como te olvido?    Me devolviste las ganas    y el amor que estaba muerto en mi vida    resucit con tu mirada y se aferr a tu sonrisa.    dime, como le hago para no pensarte?    como para no extra?arte?    para no sentir que tus brazos me rodean nuevamente ?    para no creer que si! estoy viva    y no soy un cuerpo extra?o?    como te dejo ahora si encontr la pasin?    como te explico lo que siento    si hace a?os que busco tu rostro.      Como no imaginarte en mi sendero    si eres capaz de sentir lo que siento,    si entiendes lo que pienso,    si aun despus de tanta vida separados    pude ver la misma magia amndonos al amanecer.    Como olvidar tu voz, si me susurra tierna cuando duermo?    Dime amor, como hago para no amarte, si me haces sentir mujer?    Si mi pecho se cierra de amor y me ahogo en besos no entregados ? .

Ot1R3t5uaa	try using someone else's penis and kick him into touch. he's probably only got 2 inches and that's why he won't have sex with you.|`|lGS1zOd6aa	try a fire hydren|`|yzOtKTJIaa	go to anne summers, buy one on ebay or online|`|IXSGaD5aaa	dildo|`|aXOyK3uBaa	This is totally unnatural.     Use a cucumber if it's that important to you, but don't be having sex - or losing your virginity - to a cucumber..... or JUST BECAUSE a boy "doesn't want to hurt you".    I mean, really.    "I don't want to hurt you, so is it OK if I screw you with a garden vegetable???"    Please.    Now I really HAVE heard everything.    Don't do it.|`|0t1QOKGVaa	Don't do it. You should keep your virginity for somebody that you really love, and somebody that really loves you. If this boy really did love you, he wouldn't be pressuring you into having sex with him, or getting you to masturbate in front of him with a object.    Get rid of this guy and wait for somebody that truly loves you before taking that step.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Do not do this. Sex the first time should be special and this guy is a total waste of your first time or any time for that matter. It's going to hurt the first time you have actual sex no matter what you do.|`|AA12060423	This guy doesnt deserve ur flower baby. so dont do it. please dnt be in a rush to grow up so fast. and ur too young to be using toys. soory to patrionise but you are huni. enjoy ur your youth, please, and this guy is a d!ck by the way, especially if he has done it already, he will be one of them that as soon as you did it, you would never see him again. its not as great as you think, UNLESS its with someone you really are into. and this guy, how can you be into him, hes talking abiut loosing ur virginity like its something you can go and buy. get rid of this plonker!! for the sake of womankind!!|`|w8LtNSvaaa	well try rocket you are totally waste.First Kiss and First Sex is with trure love only(Husband)
HvJpbTH8aa	he obviously likes you.   so just flirt back. ?  smile alot.   and have fun ?|`|AA11923501	Tell him you have little expierence bowling and ask if he will give you a few pointers.
tFbdkxyIaa	could you do something like bring in cookies or chocolate or fruit to share? it would be really cool if you could find out what she likes.  ask questions about what classes she's taking, what teachers she likes, or other questions you might ask a buddy. did you see such and such a show? or 'i like that sweater' or 'i like your boots'.|`|Lt793x8Uaa	Duhhh sit next to her!! n see|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Fontalk to her man, she will like it as long as you nice or funny. It's just a girl no big deal|`|35YwlNF9aa	jst try sitting next to her|`|jVHvm3akaa	you should probably talk to her before you say your like her?? maybe shes hot and all but what if you talk to her and she has really bad breath?!    hahah sit next to her and just start talking about something you think you have in common... like friends|`|AA11289793	Just like talk to her in the queue or something or just sit next to her and try talking to her and ask her if she has MSN or something, or just randomly comment about something she is talking about so that she notices you. She probably does know that you are there seen as you sit at the same table...|`|8BVEoMBraa	You stupid if she sits at your table she prolly knowwsss who ya are. so dont flip out!|`|1sA5pUV1aa	well first off try sitting NEXT to her. Thats always a big start right there. Just talk to her, be yourself and flirt with her.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Try joining in in the conversations with the people around you.  You could also try saying hi to her when you see her to see what happens!|`|FjYjujn1aa	Well first you have to get to know her. Talk and flirt- a little. Sit by her. Ask her friends about her too, see if it helps.|`|7F2enSMDaa	Sit in front of her - it sparks the conversation. It's hard to have a conversation with someone when you are beside them because you have to turn towards them. This way, it's more casual...just talk as you eat your lunch about very low-key topics. Upcoming tests, events, classes, etc...|`|2vKKLVLKaa	well its not that simple to just sit next to her.  but when you guys get up, you should just walk up to her and be like..  hey, im _____ whats your name.  'just create conversation with her.  and itll get better but you two will get to know eachother soon im sure.  or if one of your close friends is close friends with her you should hang out the three of you.?
AA10776535	Nope...Give your lawyer the list of things you want and he/she will get the judge to order when you pick the stuff up.  Do not call his parents, let the lawyer handle this.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	If you think it will help|`|u1uECuFNaa	Why not?  Then he can bring in your relatives and you can do the same.  Does that not sound a bit funny to you?|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	No  You're a grown woman. Deal with it yourself.  Get a lawyer or court order and a police escort.|`|BlVudiyfaa	sure, drag everyone into this one.|`|YvStROEfaa	Have a police escort  Good luck|`|AA11969451	You want him to leave others out of your collective business, I suggest you do the same.|`|GeruGGOQaa	So you want to call his parents to ask them to tell their son to keep people out of your divorce?  Yeah that makes a lot of since.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Nope, it will only makr the situation worse for you. Get a lawyer and the police involved|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	Call the police to escort you in to gather your belongings, then handle it from there. Your husbands parents dont have any control over what your husband and ex husband will or wont do. You could always get a restraining order after you get your stuff and let the courts handle it from there. Situations like this are not easy, but you have rights, you need to get your things, have it settled in court, and move on with your life and the healing process. Good luck.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	How will contacting his parents make anything better?  You'll just be dragging even more people into a situation where other people don't have any business being.  You say you want people to butt out, but your intended action of involving his parents contradicts that statement.  Hire an attorney and file the paperwork, including everything that you want returned to you.  Have him served with the divorce petition and get it done and over with.  Neither his parents nor your ex husband can do crap to resolve this.  A court order, on the other hand, can.  Just get it done and don't make drama where it isn't necessary.|`|pErRGYH7aa	No.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	H*LL  NO.  It doesn't matter what happened to lead to divorce, his parents will always be on the side of their little baby boy.  The only side of the story they've been hearing is his, so don't be surprised if he's embellished it quite a bit to make him look like the victim.  Unless you had a very close relationship with his parents prior to all the mess, I definately would not get them involved.|`|dVlLahozaa	You are a grown woman try other means like the police or a court order to get your stuff. Ask your ex husband to show some maturity and to deal with the problem like and adult. Good LUCK!|`|ZydKrH8Paa	No, parents have no real control over their grown kids.  Let them be, and you handle him.  Call the police and they will escort you to get the rest of your things.  Tell your husband if he doesn't stop with the harrassment and defilement you will file use it against him in the divorce.  And tell your lawyer, they should know how to handle this without hurting your favor in the divorce.|`|pA6Ntl2Eaa	No what are his parents going to do.  You are a grown woman time to handle things yourself.  If he isn't cooperating get the law involved.
GeruGGOQaa	Nope.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Probably not.   Your husband can complain if he is bothered though.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	Nope, why do you care if they are both your ex's?|`|pErRGYH7aa	You can't control him so stop trying.  Unless your 1st ex has some horrible secret that would make a difference in the divorce proceedings, let them get to be best buds and commiserate over what a horrible wife you were, while you move on with your life.      Misery loves company.|`|AA11401294	uh oh|`|pOCabUMvaa	I do not know, maybe a restraining order against both men would do, other than that, I would just ignore them, and concentrate on the real facts for your divorce.    He is just trying to get to you, and you do not want to let that happen, in the divorce proceedings, you have to be strong, with a level head, just keep doing what you are doing and do not let them know that you are angry, if they know that, then they will feed off of you like a sucker fish!!!!    And make matters worse for your divorce.    Just be calm and talk to your attorney, and get the ball rolling.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Well if you keep in contact with the first ex at all, just tell him to get a restraining order.  Then he can't contact him at all.|`|AA10555331	it's sounds like you can pick some winners... stay away from him and get help.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	there is nothing you can do. unless your first ex would bother to listen to you. which i doubt otherwise you wouldn't be here. from a legal stand point you can do nothing.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	Perhaps part of his reasons for contacting your first ex is to get you upset. . .try to let it go.  I understand this may be difficult, but if he sees that it bothers you, it might be all he needs to keep it going.  Ask yourself, what can he accomplish by this?  Try to see it for what it is - the act of a desperate man.  Maybe this will help you get over the anger and move on.|`|5LT6LRUZaa	there really isn't anything you can do about it, if you could ask the first ex to just ignore him that's about all you can do, the one thing I can add is that if your current ex tries to have your 1st ex give any sort of testimony against you it will be taken either seriously (depending on their accusations against you) or will be totally thrown out of any proceeding as being an obvious attempt by 2 ex husbands to ruin your life, my ex's 3rd wife wanted me to give a statement for her divorce and I refused...hopefully your 1st ex has enough sense to just stay out of it!
TqpFbhJwaa	believe in yourself
G1f545lJaa	Hmm.............I would either ignore them or call my cousin.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	yeah high school sucks    fighting is not the answer though, people only fight in school because they "know" its going to be broken up by teachers    just tell them to f*** off. they dont look cool by acting butch wanting to fight you |`|3kCmqrnzaa	First of all do not fight her  Just say your sorry for calling her a hoe and tell her she isn't a hoe so she feels good  If you fight her it won't make you feel any better it will only make you feel worse

4HoVVCenaa	Yes, as long as there are no children, and you don't stay together too long. Anything bought jointly is owned jointly, anything.... If the money is not kept separately, then everything purchased is jointly owned.|`|Y1AwzxrQaa	Ummm, you seem to assume that all marriages (and relationships, for that matter) end up in divorce.  Wrong!    Are you thinking about moving in with your girlfriend?  If so, don't.  You aren't ready.|`|htSZsds7aa	Not really, it will depend on how long u both have shacked up, some places its common law marriage after 5 years. Also if u buy stuff together you gotta split it 50/50.  By not getting married just proves that u really dont care about yuour partner, since u think a breakup is inevitable. If people would take thier vows seriously, and learned to compromise, and worked on thier marriages, maybe this question didnt need to be asked.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Financially better for both.  I had been living with my ex-boyfriend for over a year. He turned into Satan and I moved out. I moved out while he was at work, so there was no discussion over property. I took what I bought, including the $300 rug and his favorite pot-smoking chair. I also took half of the groceries, all the new pots and pans that I bought, I even took the can-opener, the placemats, the Q-Tips, the Advil and the toilet paper.   I had bought the venetian blinds for the apartment (16 of them), and I would have taken those too, but it would have taken a long time to get them down, so that's the only reason I left them.  I also stopped payment on my half of the rent check, and took the washer and dryer.    Cohabitation worked for me, Saved me a fortune on a divorce that I would have had to get if I had married the tool.|`|5Gt3ErYNaa	Cohabitation = way out of your parents house without having to have a decent career/income. Easy road. So, yes.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Nope.  You can still get your *** raked by just living together.  Without legal documents stating that you are married, either partner can say, "Well, I bought that, I paid that" and with no proof, you fight over it.  If you're married, everything is 50/50.  Obviously you aren't ready to be in a relationship or you wouldn't be asking this question.  There is more to marriage than money, and finances don't mean squat when you truly love someone and want to be with them for the rest of your life.  Yes, money causes arguments, but if you take your vows seriously, it won't be the cause of divorce.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I would change her so that she had the shape changing power of Mystique in the X-Men movies.    Sorry, were you asking for something more realistic?  OK, then, I would change her so that she taught our 11 and 16 year old children more and gave them more responsibility rather than doing things for them and babying them.|`|NOYxalJ6aa	I wish he had more confidence in himself and wasn't battling depression and anxiety disorders any more.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	That he show more interest sexually.|`|JDUhhAQyaa	yes I would have been more into him and his needs.  I still love my husband and pray he get's into Jesus.
IuJjYz6gaa	First off, the pay and benefits are much better if he goes active duty rather going going National Guard.  If you get married, he will receive a housing allowance or you can live on post.     Here is a pay table, if you scroll down you'll see that national guard only gets paid very little for drill.  It is for the navy, but all services get paid the same amount base pay.  http://www.navycs.com/09militarypaychart...    As far as starting the conversation with him, don't approach him in an attacking manner (like asking why it's okay for you and not for him).  Tell him why you think it's a good idea or not.  Just accept that he has changed his mind for whatever reason.    It sounds like he's thinking about doing the best thing for the two of you, and thinking very seriously about marrying you.    As far as marrying him with a quarter machine ring, I totally know how you feel.  I married my husband with a cheap ring.  And at our 3 year anniversary (after he got a nice re-enlistment bonus) he bought me a nice ring.  :)    EDITED:  I just wanted to add that I'll have to respectfully disagree with the poster above me.       My husband is about to be a recruiter and they are NOT trained to lie to you.  The ones who do go against everything they are taught.  And if they are caught, they face UCMJ action.    No matter the MOS, he will probably deploy.  Everyone deploys these days.  Everyone is in danger due to IED's.  What I would urge him to do, though, is pick something that he can do outside of the military, in case he does not want to stay in (or even if he does).  Combat arms MOS's typically do not have civilian equivilant jobs, which can make it hard to do anything else if you want to get out.    The pay isn't bad at all.  In fact, it gets better with each passing year and rank.  If you can get through the beginning ranks and years, it gets better from there.  I do not work, we have two children, and we live very comfortably.    And as far as the lifestyle goes, it's not that bad.  In fact, I've been doing this 8 years now and I can't see my life any othe way.  Yes the deployments stink, but you get through them and you are become stronger individually as well as a couple because of them.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	Both of those questions come off very negetive and accusational, and he probably "just doesnt wanna hear it" (thats what i hear all the time). I think you should not worry about it till it happens. if it does happen, ask if you guys can pan out some details of what the game plan is for him leaving and ask your questions like you're just looking for details not like you're looking for answers so you can bombard him with accusations. give up on the 'why can you but i cant' because you'll never get an answer that will satisfy you, everyone has double standards and its not going to make him stay home.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	The way you started it before shouldn't have made him upset.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Him (or even you) joining the military could be a great thing! If he wants to get married then just tell him ya'll can go to walmart and get the wedding bands (about $30). I'm not gonna lie, the military is hard stuff! Whether you are the soldier or spouse of the soldier! But all in all, it is a great thing to do something for your country|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	do not say "why can you join the military but i can't" thats just asking for an argument. dont be so defensive. when you say "are you really going to..." it makes it sound almost bad. you should say that youve been researching the military and all the benefits and how you would support him if he made that choice.|`|OG4410bdaa	ok    first of all  you are right about one thing:  you both need to sit down and have a very blunt, very open conversation about this whole situation  if you don't talk to each other then the situation will just get worse!  you need to be able to communicate  (the posters above are correct that you need to word this so he does not become defensive when you try to talk to him, try using "I feel..." statements and never ever ever start a sentence with the word "you" because that just puts people on the defense right away)    second of all  (and I say this as an army wife-)  if you're serious about one of you joining the military as a means of a secure paycheck then I'm going to strongly urge you to  1- NOT join the national guard (he would be deployed more often if he was in the national guard than he would if he was in another branch)  2- find someone you can trust who is in the military, and has been in for 4-5 years, to talk to about what the military is really like  3- do NOT trust recruiters, they are trained to lie to you in order to get you to sign up- they get paid for every person they sign up so they'll tell you basically anything you want to hear to get you to sign up (some will even tell you that you won't be deployed which is a horrible lie)  4- think carefully about the MOS that you want to sign up for (if he signs up for something like mechanic or infantry then he'll be deployed more often and have a more dangerous job to do overseas -however- if he signs up for something such as military intelligence then he'll be more likely to have a nice safe desk job and be deployed less often)  5- the military doesn't pay much for the job he does, and as an army wife you'll often times feel like he's married to the military and you're just a mistress, but there are alot of perks that make it worth while if that's what you really want to do (perks like his G.I. bill for school when he gets out, the chance for the family to travel, great play groups for the kids if you plan on having any, tax free grocery shopping on base, a steady pay-check without having to worry about being fired)  -You get out of the military what you put into it-|`|RDgyb7W8aa	As old soldier I'll give advice that military used to say years ago.  "If we wanted you to have a spouse, we would have issued you one"

Divorce her if you are unhappy, but make sure you get the kids and make her pay child support, she can afford it, or at least make her pay alimony because you are accustomed to a certain type of lifestyle. On ther other hand, you know that beauty will fade with time, and you shopuld have considered that.

Well, I can enlighten you. Marriage is the beacon of passion, companionship, and most importantly of all unconditional love.   The thing that you are lacking in here is the last part. Why marry her  in the first place if all you cared for was if she was beautiful or not?   Personally [and i am trying hard not to swear here] I think that you would be better off down a whore club or something if looks are the only thing for you.|`|iz9qy02Caa	dude that sucks... idk tell her she should loose some weight in the nicest way possible.. tell her u will work out with her! if she takes it offensivley and doesnt wna loose the weight maybe she will leave you and make it easier hahhaa.|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	I THINK UR AN A**HOLE!!!|`|lXEvMuJBaa	If I married you I would get fat and ugly too...in hopes that you would leave me the HELL alone!|`|S9QAVL0iaa	i can only wonder how a person like yourself live with yourself cause that's is disgusting|`|AA10392041	That's your problem.  Nobody I know would even go that far as to marry a woman for her looks.  First of all, looks change over time.  What happened?  Did she have a baby, sit upon her behind and eat herself into a stupor, or what?  And the issue of her parents being really rich shouldn't have a thing to do with it.  Have you discussed this with her?  I think you are a prude; you are stuck on looks and money instead of love.  Also, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  You might look like crap to her but I take it she loves you anyway.
7CmkRkEMaa	The art of conversation is a sensitive situation and depends upon who is involved always. Obviously, in an adversarial role, it may be difficult regarding emotional content. That is why ahead of time, one must know who is involved and the subject matter. Of course, to be so strategic especially in a light social gathering would seem extreme, but when the feelings are an issue and one is a more sensitive type, perhaps a more strategic manoeuvre is in order. It depends upon a lot of factors.     Immaturity and lack of self-control in the situation you portrayed is true albeit it is easy to set-off emotions especially under adverse conditions. Attitude is always the key whilst information will be secondary because forceful attitude coupled with a nonsense phrase can be overwhelming. Therefore, the feeling of balance remains the ultimate outcome without labefaction or losing face. Labefaction in certain countries causes suicide. It is a feeling of embarrassment that can be worse than death and is, when suicide is considered an option instead. Now, we can see how important a conversation can be when we remember the adage, "The pen is mightier than the sword." That means the oral words coupled with emotions may bring the universe to ruin especially ones own.

Atualmente este papel est invertido, o macho beta passou a ser o alvo preferido delas. Ns, cozinhamos, fazemos carinhos, admitimos nossos erros e fraquezas, pedimos perd?o, limpamos a casa, s vezes ganhamos menos e ainda sim felizes por ver nossa companheira no topo.

Explica??o: existe em ambos os sexos uma  certa dose de horm?nios do sexo oposto, que serve de contrapeso s caractersticas extremas de cada um. Isso permite, entre outras coisas, que haja um certo entendimento entre os sexos.    Como? Os homens com altas doses de horm?nio masculino tendem a ser muito insensveis, egocntricos agressivos, violentos e tendem a menosprezar as peculiaridades do comportamento feminino, que classificam como frescura. Tendem a ser excessivamente duros e arrogantes. Gostam de fazer sexo com as mulheres, mas desprezam as caractersticas da personalidade feminina, acham-se superiores a elas.    Tendem a radicalizar em tudo e pouco se importam com o sofrimento alheio desde que imponham o que querem. Nas suas rela??es querem se afirmar impondo temor aos outros.    A testosterona  o horm?nio que impele  agressividade e  impulsividade. D grande impulso ao desejo sexual.    O seu aspeto fsico atrai fortemente as mulheres.    Os homens que possuem uma dose maior de horm?nio feminino conseguem entender mais as mulheres e se relacionar melhor com elas, ser mais cordiais e ainda assim continuar sendo msculos e ativos.    Nas mulheres, o excesso de progesterona as torna extremamente sexies, mas por outro lado excessivamente dengosas, manhosas e caprichosas, tendendo a buscar obter o que querem sem ter que se esfor?ar muito fisicamente; por qualquer coisas sentem-se doentes, irritam-se com facilidade por qualquer bobagem e coisas sem importancia.     Vivem "estrelando", n?o gostam de fazer nada que lhes d um certo trabalho ou concentra??o, por qualquer coisa assim, queixam-se que est?o "cansadas", "exaustas"; s?o as chamadas mulheres cheias de frescurinhas.    S?o excessivamente vaidosas e competem impiedosamente com as outras mulheres para ser o centro de todas as aten??es. O seu aspecto fsico atrai fortemente os homens.      No relacionamento com os homens procuram impor os seus caprichos e exigncias, se n?o obtiver o que desejam, usam de todas as armas que disp?em para isso e caso n?o consigam, desfazem a rela??o sem hesitar, pelo abandono ou pela trai??o. Apesar de muito atraentes, tem menor desejo sexual do que as que possuem uma dose maior de testosterona no organismo.    A progesterona d as caractersticas de languidez, intensa sensibilidade emocional faz a mulher variar da suavidade  irrita??o rapidamente. D as formas arredondadas s mulheres da o seu excesso acabar por provocar acmulo de gordura, celulite etc...    A mulheres com dose de testosterona mais alta do que as extremamente femininas tendem a serem mais ativas, mais dinamicas, mais constantes e mais compreensivas com os homens, s?o fortes sem deixar de ser fmeas, belas e atraentes, alm disso o seu desejo sexual  mais intenso (a testosterora intensifica o desejo sexual).     assim quando essas doses est?o em um certo equilbrio em ambos os sexos.    A natureza sbiamente, procura com isso equilibrar os extremos e creio que sem isso as pessoas se matariam umas s outras porque certamente n?o se entenderiam de modo algum, por isso precisam perceber um pouco como os outros se sentem sem perder a sua identidade.    A tempo: um pouco de horm?nio do sexo oposto, todo mundo tem, tanto os homens quanto as mulheres; inclusive as superfmeas e os supermach?es, as propor??es dessa mistura  que podem ser mais ou menos equilibradas.    Uma mistura mais equilibrada dos horm?nios masculino e feminino em algum, n?o transforma as mulheres em sapat?es nem os homens em bichas. Apenas d mais equilbrio, torna a pessoa mais temperada, mais estvel.    O desconhecimento da constitui??o natural do ser humano  que faz as pessoas acreditarem que as pessoas s?o exclusivamente masculinas  ou exclusivamente femininas. Ensina-se j no curso fundamental que tanto no homem quanto na mulher existem os horm?nios masculino e o feminino. Ent?o, porque o espanto?    Os tra?os femininos de que os pequisadores falam existem normalmente nos homens mais equilibrados, n?o significa tricotar, ser atrado por pessoas do mesmo sexos gostar de frescuras, etc...  Significa ter um temperamento masculino com alguns tra?os de tolerancia, compreens?o, solidariedade. E s?o sem dvida alguma, machos. E s?o bons parceiros para as mulheres.    Nas mulheres mais equilibradas, ter alguns tra?os masculinos, n?o significa torna-se violenta, dominadora, rude, insensvel. Significa ter um comportamento tpicamente feminino, mas com uma certa disposi??o ao movimento, ao dinamismo,  esportividade, uma certa dose de vontade, de independncia, uma certa resistncia emocional aliadas  sua natural sensibilidade. E gostam sim e muito de homens. E s?o timas companheiras para os homens.

A prpria psicanlise revela atravs de seus estudos que a mulher quer e precisa ser tratada como igual e se sentir importante, mas se  mulher ela quer um homem, e isso n?o  s ser um indivduo do sexo masculino, mas tem a ver com carter,  personalidade, humor e comportamento. Mesmo que pare?a contradizer por meio de rea??es, a mulher quer e precisa ser e se sentir protegida e compreendida, ao passo que se isso n?o for realidade, seria completamente desnecessrio ter um parceiro fixo, visto que, se fosse apenas necessidade sexual, n?o seria mistrio nenhum pra mulher conseguir algum que a satisfizesse a hora em que ela achasse necessrio; mas ela precisa de algum que a complemente, porque nem o homem sozinho  completo e nem a mulher sozinha  completa. S?o hbitos, atitudes, pensamentos e necessidades diferentes que v?o se completar com parceiros tambm diferentes. Por muitas vezes a mulher faz uma pergunta ao homem pra exercitar seu poder de decis?o, pra ver se ele tem firmeza na palavra, e, pra efeito de teste, s vezes ela se op?e  decis?o do homem pra ver se ele sabe como agir nessa situa??o. Mas se a resposta do homem for: voc decide, voc que sabe, eu n?o sei, o que voc acha?, ou voc que manda, a mulher fica louca. Se ela pergunta ela quer resposta. Mulher n?o gosta de machista, mas ela gosta de macho. Algum que possa ser mais "homem" do que ela. Ao se marcar um encontro ela quer que o homem decida onde e quando; se ele disser: eu n?o sei, pra onde voc acha que a gente deve ir? ou coisa do gnero, h um certo risco da mulher dar "bolo", afinal ela sofreu a decep??o de ter marcado um encontro com um "banana" ao qual ela pensou ser um homem (isso  baseado em pesquisa cientfica feita por psicanalistas norte-americanos).  Quando a pesquisa fala em tra?os femininos, n?o seriam necessariamente fsicos, e sim psicolgicos. As mulheres s?o atradas por homem que tm um prumo em equilbrio: querem um macho que tem poder de decis?o e saiba como agir para proteger e suprir as verdadeiras necessidades de sua amada, mas que saiba compreend-la, que dialogue com ela, que a fa?a se sentir importante e a tenha como um ser humano dotado de sentimentos e necessidades assim como ele, e n?o uma mera massa corprea que envolve o nico objeto de prazer que ele almeja. Esses tra?os femininos est?o, na realidade, impregnados no seu carter, que s?o identificados atravs de suas a??es e o convvio, e n?o no esteretipo, que por incrvel que pare?a, n?o tem, absolutamente, nenhum valor pra mulher. O que adianta um homem que parece um deus grego, sarad?o, msculo, mas que seja um "babac?o", s fale besteira, ou que s olhe para o seu prprio umbigo? De que adianta a mulher ter em seus bra?os um "Brad Pitt" na vida se ela sabe que ela n?o  a nica que o tem?  Um homem pode n?o ter tanta beleza, mas se ele tem atributos que s?o patentes atravs de suas a??es que realmente agradam a mulher ele va, na vis?o feminina, aumentando sua beleza gradativamente. Funciona assim: a mulher  atrada pelo que sente a n?o pelo que v. Porque hoje em dia  simples conseguir beleza exterior. O difcil  ter um bom carter sendo ele autntico e n?o fingido; e isso n?o  conseguido por qualquer um.  Tra?os femininos, nesse contexto,  resumido em sentimentos, vontades e desejos; aquilo que constri um bom carter.  Significa ter sentimentos e se preocupar em satisfazer a necessidade do outro e n?o apenas a prpria.|`|16392f8cdf3acd6fb1ae345e5db6b941aa	com certeza...    esses caras musculosos n?o aguentam 2 seguidas....s bomba...    pra que ser bombado se n?o aguenta 5 minutos de sexo?|`|68dd8c4a4c46fabcf126b3ee67d6a901aa	Boa tarde, pessoal.

Na sociedade moderna, cada vez menos deixa de haver espa?o para esse biotipo de "msculo" pois as mulheres est?o inegavelmente conquistando um espa?o maior e torna-se necessrio a convivncia entre parceiros de maneira que a sociedade est deixando de ser patriarcal. Veja-se, por exemplo, o nosso cdigo civil, que n?o mais fala em "Ptrio poder " mas em "Poder Familiar" exercido tanto pelo homem, quanto pela mulher.   As fei??es mais femininas s?o provenientes de uma modelagem de um corpo biolgico plasmado pelo psiquismo da entidade ( esprito ), que vai reencarnar - segundo os ensinamentos espiritistas - sendo que revela, por vezes, uma personalidade mais sensvel, com aptid?es que requerem essa forma, nada tendo a ver com homossexualismo. Outros, ainda mantm em seus perispritos, as formas msculas que trouxeram em reencarna??es transatas. tudo vai depender da experincia de vida que o indivduo tenha que trilhar.    Diante disso,  normal que uns indivduos possuam corpo biolgico com caractersticas mais femininas, porque nas suas histrias reencarnatrias, agregam em si maior nmero de experincias femininas, sendo o inverso tambm verdadeiro.     Os conflitos surgem quando o indivduo est numa  realidade biolgica, mas pende para outra realidade psicolgica, como no caso do homossexualismo - sem nenhuma crtica .     Quase me esque?o.  uma quest?o primordial das sociedade, a continuidade da espcie. Ao longo das existncias  certo que a antropologia nos mostra que as possibilidades de vida humana exigiam certos esfor?os e virilidade, de maneira que as mulheres, como reprodutoras, procuravam sempre um biotipo msculo porque pensavam que em raz?o dos seus dotes fsicos, seus descendentes teriam maiores probabilidades de sobrevivncia num ambiente hostil. Uma rela??o tpica do reino animal.     Entretanto, com o avan?o e as mudan?as de concep??es, o ser humano gradativamente, vem passando do reino animal para o hominal, cercado pelas facilidades de uma sociedade transformada, que de certa maneira supre aquelas necessidades de milhares de anos atrs.     Sendo a mulher dotada de certo esprito de sensiblidade em rela??o ao meio, muito mais do que o homem,  claro que ir procurar as caractersticas que estejam mais afinadas com suas aspira??es de vida. Diante de tudo isso, acredito sim no que foi afirmado pelas pesquisas e concordo com tais assertivas.|`|DnhtiRFHaa	Ol!!    eu concordo com certeza,pois meu ex.era exatamente este biotipo.|`|0M0dDqRWaa	Essa histria de homem muito masculino ou com tra?os femininos  tudo conversa fiada.

As muilheres fogem de homens que acham que a mulher  um objeto que pode ser usado quando quizer, fogem de homens que n?o conseguem demonstrar seu prazer diante de uma fmea.  Quanto a parte de feminilidade que um homem possa ter, n?o trata-se de ser ou ter aparncia feminina,  ser companheiro e ajudar numa lou?a ou lavar um banheiro, sem questionamentos,  gostar de flores e uma boa msica, ser simptico e educado.

Querem mesmo  aproveitar e se divertir.  Por outro lado,  o companheirismo e o comprometimento n?o est limitado a forma fsica, homens com tra?os femininos podem ser igualmente assediados basta ser simptico e ter um rostinho bonito.   Relacionamento permanente, hoje,  quase a excess?o e isto tem mais a ver com a idade. Quanto mais jovem a pessoa quer mais  se divertir.

Por outro lado, a quest?o da infidelidade, um homem do tipo "normal" tem pouca chance em conquistar uma mulher com somente uma cantada, fato que para homens mais "masculinos", esta cantada as vezes nem se faz necessria....|`|3D1cJRYpaa	eu concordo sim,homens com essas caras quadradas e todo fort?o eles acham que j s?o o suficientes e que n?o precisa fazer mais nada para agradar uma mulher.na minha opini?o musculos,s mesmo na sopa.....|`|886d94ae7faccdc6b37af6b921d8f65aaa	Concordo com a pesquisa Inglesa, no entanto, para o sexo, duvido q alguma mulher queira um homen "companheiro e com tra?os femininos"!|`|UNesdpbOaa	N?o concordo!!Prefiro algum ke me pegue de jeito ao ter um metrosexual, n?o curto!!|`|VOByKWSDaa	comcordo plenamente, beleza nao e tudo e, machismo esta por fora .|`|b2ac5bd204bb7212d65916f9b14544a7aa	Os mach?es s?o egostas, pois demonstram em suas atitudes extrema independncia e autoridade que confrontam com mulheres inteligentes.

Da os resultados da pesquisa tenderem para esse processo.|`|8H4nX2kSaa	Na  minha opini?o Homens com tra?os '' femininos'' n?o s?o gays,at porque sabe-se que muitas mulheres gostam de ser cuidadas gostam de receber carinho aten??o.  Boa parte das mulheres gostam de se sentirem protegidas e isso um homen mach?o que pensa 24 horas do seu dia em sexo e dentro desse tempo ainda continua a cobi?ar e cortejar outras mulheres na rua, na minha consep??o de ideia as mulheres n?o gostam desse tipo de homen e  nesse mmento que homens que tens um pouco mais de sensibilidade e que por si s garantem a sua masculinidade entram pra fazer a diferen?a.Enfin antes um homen sensivel e que saiba fazer uma mulher feliz tanto na cama quanto no dia-a-dia do que um homen que queira a mulher s pra sexo e depois acabou.A todas as mulheres ,pensem se  mais vlido ter um mach?o esparramado no sof e vc tendo de criar seus filhos praticamente sozinha e cozinhandu lavandu e passandu pro seu marido ou ent?o ter um esposo ''sensivel'' de espirito pra te ajudar e te fazer feliz vc e a toda a sua familia .pense nisso.|`|88ba6d36873bd12ad92654ee4bf0decfaa	Concordo.|`|4baac49e6650ab52936755b2ad2ae63faa	A cultura britanica e americana vm flexibilizando suas posturas. Chico Ansio j dizia que estava receoso de ir  Inglaterra, pois, em tempo atrs era proibido o relacionamento homossexual, depois passou a ser permitido, e agora, diante de grandes campanhas de apoio ao movimento gay, ele receia que este tipo de relacionamento seja obrigatrio. Claro que se trata de uma piada do humorista, mas que reflete mudan?as culturais expressivas. Todavia, sem que se refute a tolerancia social, mudan?as como essas dependem de diversos fatores, tais como a seguran?a fsica da mulher, a liberdade poltica, financeira, profissional, dentre outras coisas. Pergunto, porque hoje em dia os filmes de sexo produzidos nos EUA sempre mostram cenas de mulheres trocando carcias com outras mulheres? Porque o homem americano gosta tanto dessa cena, enquanto, boa parte dos homens brasileiros, principalmente, aqueles mais velhos, rejeitam? Ser que a independncia, o acesso a tarefas mais pesadas, e que exigem mais agressividade, vividas por mulheres em pases ricos, teria tornado essas mulheres um tanto mais masculinizadas? Diante disso, n?o seria a partir dessa realidade (alm de outros fatores) que as mulheres pesquisadas estariam mais propensas a preferir os homens com visual mais feminino (certa invers?o de papel)?  Imagino que essa pesquisa n?o retrate ainda a condi??o cultural brasileira, e que isso ocorre deste modo, somente nas mulheres de l. Mas, por fim, pergunto, e as nossas mulheres (brasileiras), t?o lindas, femininas, tender?o a tomar este mesmo caminho? Tambm pergunto, ser que a cultura americana ou britanica, estaria influenciando homens e mulheres brasileiras a adotarem tais mudan?as? Eu, pessoalmente gostaria que isso n?o acontecesse|`|1df4a0c1e43c64a757444f4cd87729dbaa	Penso, em primeiro lugar, que a busca incessante por parceiros diversos pode ser um problema mal resolvido na subjetividade de homens e mulheres. Segundo, homens que est?o mais preocupados com a aparncia do que com o sentimento, na verdade podem n?o gostar muito do sexo oposto.  Excesso de masculinidade pode indicar outras op??es de vida, pois se gosto muito de mim porque sou masculino e o masculino me atrai de determinada forma, preciso pensar quem sou e o que gosto.  Terceiro, a infidelidade n?o tem muito haver com masculinidade, penso que estar sendo infiel pode indicar que n?o estou mais satisfeito com a rela??o que tenho, pois se sinto a necessidade de ter um novo sempre  porque existe em mim uma insatisfa??o que pode ser comigo mesmo ou com o outro que escolhi ou que fiquei devido a algumas circunstancias definidas pela prpria vida.  Enfim, concordo com o estudo em parte, quando a masculinidade excessiva indica um problema n?o resolvido na subjetividade. Contudo, a meu ver o masculino e a masculinidade s?o salutares nos relacionamentos. Quanto a quest?o de homens mais sensveis e menos sensveis n?o acho que esteja vinculado  masculinidade e/ou feminilidade. O que existe  um padr?o criado socialmente definindo que se for masculino deve ser menos sensvel e se for feminino mais sensvel. Temos que pensar que somos seres humanos e, por isso, semelhantes. Os sentimentos ou a forma como sentimos cada coisa ir depender de um arcabou?o que nos forma desde a concep??o at a vida adulta. Ou seja, sensibilidade  inerente a alma humana quer seja ela masculina ou feminina. N?o  porque sou mulher que tenho uma sensibilidade mais apurada, talvez a tenha porque aprendi ao longo da minha histria que isso  um elemento essencial para o feminino construdo socialmente. Conhe?o vrias pessoas, homens e mulheres, em vrios momentos de suas vidas, e o que posso dizer  que s?o mais ou menos sensveis em decorrncia dos circunstanciais da vida, das perdas, das dores sentidas, do respeito pelo outro e do sentimento que cultiva por esse outro.|`|1wSrJGsaaa	Para mim a pesquisa n?o faz referncia  aparncia do homem muito masculino e sim com rela??o s atitudes machistas dos homens que, na minha opini?o, aparncia n?o tem nada a ver com comportamento !!!   Por isso concordo que as mulheres prefiram homens que saibam ouvir, compreender, conversar, acompanhar, agradar, ser carinhoso e sem perder o prazer pelo sexo !!!  Acredito que machismo e desempenho sexual n?o tem nenhuma rela??o direta !!! Podemos ser homens sensveis, mas entre 4 paredes ... Sai de baixo !!!|`|UfN4C9aJaa	Concordo plenamente, homens extremamente preocupados com a prpria aparncia tem tendncia de prestar pouca aten??o na companhia que est ao seu lado.

Acho super  vlida a pesquisa, creio que veio em boa hora,  porque  o que se v  na midia  a supervaloriza?ao do corpo, se uma mulher famosa ou nao  namora ou se casa   com um cara  que seja do "tipo" comum  ela  evista como uma pessoa que nao encontrou nada melhor. Ai eu pergunto melhor em qu?   em ter musculos saltando pela camiseta "mam?e to forte" ?   um homem  de  corpo definido e realmente  muito bonito!   agora  apartir do momento que passa a ser obcess?o ,  creio que  o cara tenha dificuldades de lidar com seu "eu" ai  passa  tomar bomba, malhar ao extremo pra que haja uma aceita?ao, n?o das outras pessoas mas de  si mesmo.   creio que o intuito da pesquisa  nao seja falar mal de quem malha, at porque  ta dizendo assim:  OS HOMENS  DE ASPECTO MUITO MASCULINOS.  Pra mim tem mais haver com atitudes, no mundo de hoje em que mulher trabalha, estuda, cuida de casa, filhos e  etc...  normal que ela procure  um homem que  seja  companheiro, ajudador, e que se comprometa acima de tudo com a familia, pra que  ela tenha mesmo com que contar....Alguem disse antes que as mulheres estao de olho na conta bancaria dos caras sensiveis.....E que quem  gosta de homem sao os"gays" nao concordo!!!   sabe porque?  as mulheres  conquistaram seu espa?o!!!! nao precisam se encostar em ninguem!!!  na verdade falta homem de verdade para conquistar estas mulheres,  os homens tem medo de mulheres independentes!!

Sem dvida que os homens que n?o valorizam muito a aparncia (falo de msculos e esttica, n?o de limpeza e cuidados fundamentais) s?o geralmente pessoas que pensam que carter e respeito s?o os requisitos principais para uma rela??o a dois. Tudo isso em tese.   Gostei de saber desse resultado.

Alm disso, os mach?es s?o "predadores" e fazem  com que as mulheres - as psicologicamente madudas, claro - os repudiem.   por isso que homens com tra?os mais delicados tendem a se emparceirar com as mulheres quando na forma??o de um casal.

O ridiculo tambm chama muito aten??o.    Agora essa histria de que homens com tra?os mais femininos normalmente n?o traem  uma grande mentira, quando o homem quer ou tem que trair ele trai e pronto.

A beleza, a masculinidade sempre  o primeiro alvo da mulher, mas a grande maioria destas mulheres procuram outros atrativos como respeito, delicadeza, dinheiro, companheirismo que em sua essncia s?o requisitos para uma convivncia imediata ou duradoura.  A preferncia de uma mulher  diretamente proporcional ao tipo de carncia  que ela mais tem num determinado momento, e o homem deve observar estas carncias para responder a estas ansiedades, provocando a magia do amor.  N?o existe uma formula mgica para um relacionamento, pois o homem tem suas carncias afetivas ou n?o e a mulher tambm deve perceber e responder a estes "desafios"  estimulando um relacionamento mais afetivo e duradouro para ambos.  No fundo um relacionamento s d certo se e somente se ambos se esfor?am para conquistar seu parceiro.

Despus, podemos superarlo o quedarnos enganchadas a ese sufrimiento, creer que siempre nos va a pasar igual y no confiar en futuras relaciones. ?Cmo se deja atrs un fracaso amoroso? ?Cmo nos curamos de un desenga?o? ?Hasta qu punto puede ser bueno que alguien nos abandone?  Superar un desenga?o es posible cuando estamos dispuestas a aceptar que nosotras tenemos participacin en lo que nos ocurre. Somos responsables, que no culpables, de nuestras relaciones, aunque gran parte de lo que sucede en ellas proviene de una historia emocional que nos habita, pero que no conocemos, y que proviene de los modelos inconscientes de relacin que tenemos interiorizados.   El primer paso sera preguntarse qu es lo que nos ha llevado a una relacin decepcionante, que nos hace sufrir, para despus analizar el vnculo amoroso. Por ltimo, es conveniente averiguar si se est mejor y ms tranquila que antes.      DESPUES DE TERMINAR UNA RELACION, LO IMPORTANTE ES MADURAR ESOS DETALLES QUE LLEVARON AL FRACASO, Y HACER UNA MEDITACION PERSONAL, Y DARSE EL TIEMPO DE VIVIR TRANQUILAMENTE Y HASTA HABERSE LIBERADO DE ESOS SENTIMIENTOS SE LE PUEDE DAR COBERTURA AL PROXIMO AMOR.....CON UNA ALMA LIMPIA Y TRASPARENTE.

a6fdab81ced14fb6fee0afbc22ac12b2aa	You might still have a chance with her.    Right now it sounds like she is going through a rough time.  Just be her friend.  Try to avoid having sex with her until she breaks up with the current boyfriend.  If you have sex with her now then later if you are with her it will bother you that she cheated on her prior boyfriend, even if it was with you.  It is fine to cuddle.    She sounds like she has some problems in her life.  Was she abused growing up, or does she have a parent who is an alcoholic?  You should encourage her to get counseling.  If not then even if you end up with her again you will probably lose her.    Please do not let this be a pattern with her.  If she leaves this guy and gets another boyfriend besides you then that will be the unmistakable sign that you need to completely remove yourself from her.|`|AA11038398	a born flirt|`|1a348ab0340b840f21ab2784d4cc3657aa	She sounds like she is confused. And why would you want to be with someone who would cheat on her current boyfriend? This girl has no morals, ethics, or values. Go out and meet a NICE girl who will appreciate you. It is best to find someone whom you have alot in common with. After the lust wears off, then you are still in love. However, you do not say how old you are. I am assuming college age. If you are younger than that - then stay true to yourself and wait awhile on sex, love, and marriage.|`|yQWEzWqSaa	She is hurting you and you should not ler her. She is confusing you and only thinking about herself. She does not love her boyfriend if she shows you all this attention and even cuddles. I think she is confused. Dont let her take advantage of you. Tell her straight out that you still have feelings for her and you want to be in a relationship. She is hurting u sweetie and you should not let her because the only one getting hurt is you. You even said it yourself that you have been depressed over her. Do you want to continue to be? Is that how you want to end up? No dont settle for what she is giving you, if she is not willing to give you more then dont pay attention to her. Get away from her. It will be hard but you can do it. She is not a good person if she is doing this to you and to her boyfriend. Being dishonest will lead you nowhere and she is headed that way. If you continue to do this one day you both will end up either kissing or getting involved. Do you want to have the guilt of being with somebody elses lady? Its a terrible thing to have and I dont want you to go thru that. Think about it. If you tell her how you feel, you will lose nothing, you might even gain. What if she feels the same way? But dont keep on hurting yourself or letting her hurt you...  God Bless
Uyz6iZwKaa	If you think you really like her then tell her and if it doesnt work out atleast you can still be friends.|`|yOL73epdaa	do what you think is the best...|`|krDqGelIaa	yeaah boi. jump on that while it's still freshhh|`|GObmVQk3aa	You might have a chance. You can find out by maybe asking someone to ask her if she likes you or something, but pursuing it may end your friendship.|`|zDT4AgGcaa	Forget it.    In your words she's "all over" your friend, while she only "sometimes" flirts with you. You already know the answer. Also, when you spend a lot of time with a girl, looking at your own feelings is actually a pretty good guide to what she's feeling. In your case, you feel like she's your best friend. $100 says she feels the same way.    I'm sorry, i know this wasn't the answer you were looking for; i feel like you came on here to get some encouragement. I just call them like I see them though.    There are plenty of other hotties out there. Good luck man!|`|AGXysOpzaa	Make sure she's worth dating. If she flirts with you then your friend five minutes later, I'd say you should just drop it and move on. If she does it now, she'll do it while you're dating. If you still want to date her, don't try to compete with your friend. I like it when a guy smiles at me, and just says hi, how are you. If you do that, she'll probably want you more, just because you care about her. For God's sake, don't tell her she's hot and don't look at her boobs.|`|DT84bcetaa	If you really like her then you need to pursue!
xszqbAFXaa	Why don't you just tell them that you'd like to go out to eat. That way you'll have a free meal, and they can treat you. Tell them that you don't want any singing or anything like that. Just something simple. I bet that would make you both happy.|`|cjx6OnI8aa	They might already have somthing lanned for u.... and you telling them you dont want anything is like saying "I dont want your crap"...so just  take everything eith a grain of sand and smile, when you get older you will miss all of this...|`|r0d37w2kaa	27|`|usFWXupbaa	They are making a huge deal because yes your growing up, but they are afraid when you move out or go to college that they won't have the time to celebrate your birthday. It sounds like there is another reason why you don't want your birthday celebrated. But, hey it may just be a tradition to them and it means quite a bit. Now a days it's hard to get my family together for anything and I'm only 24 years old. I wish my family were like yours. :) You must be really special to them. Good Luck!|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	my family's like that. i didnt want to celebrate and they just kept pressing it but i didnt give up on it and they eventually gave up.  if you really dont want to celebrate then dont. you dont have to explain yourself to them. if you really dont want to do it, dont cave in.|`|HvJpbTH8aa	my family is like that too.   it's ridiculous.   just make them happy, have cake invite a couple friends over.   just chill. it wont seem like your birthday if you just hang out around the house.   ?   good luck!|`|4cJZ3SIWaa	Maybe becuase they love you and feel this is a good opportunity to make you feel special?|`|uhmWX5Qkaa	try and keep your family happy but try and get them see your point of view as well. They should respect your choices. Tell them that I cant cope with b-day's and studying and you dont want a fuss etc.|`|AA10199189	you know, they probably have your gift already, some of them, and they are looking forward to a party - it will be spring so extra reason to celebrate -    accept a little do.  if they don't want to not give you a gift, tell them you would rather they donate in your name to the local food bank.    and if you want to be extra creative, tell them you would like the party to be held at the foodbank, with everyone pitching in and sharing the cake and goodies with the others who work there. (or who are its clients, depending on the size of yr usual bash)|`|aIHSmRYwaa	Why don't you want those things? Are you thinking of suicide?

puOTqIBUaa	If its your "best guy friend" then you need to mind your own business.  Otherwise you seem petty and jealous.|`|AA10873763	If you are friends with the girl, talk to her about it.  Otherwise, don't get involved.|`|N1qKXDs2aa	Tell it all (if the girl accepts). imagine if you were her boyfriend, i think you would like to know|`|hG9e4nNLaa	You could drop hints so it SEEMS like he found out on his own, that way you don't get hurt.|`|EdidZdtlaa	dont tell him. no offence but its not your buisness. you might get mixed up in some type of drama. let him find out by himself.|`|8RyX43hcaa	Keep out of it or you risk being blamed when it all blows up.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	stay out of it|`|iXt3erseaa	Stay out of it. Tell your guy friend that you disapprove, because he's your friend and you can say that to him. But otherwise, stay out of it.|`|wCVnav0Maa	don;t intervene it has nothing to do with you. you coming into it will just make things worse leave it be and let them figure it out|`|x7tsarblaa	I honestly think that this is a situation better left for the couple themselves. Maybe he is aware of it, some couples do have open relationships. Even though you are aware of it, and he is your best friend, getting in the middle could result in a backlash on you. You could be accused of starting a rumor or the girl could have your friend go against you. Time will tell, Karma has a way of always evening things out.|`|8BVEoMBraa	stay out of it|`|zo1lvjLlaa	if your friends with her boyfriend, then yeah you should tell him. because its unfair to him that his girlfriend is doing that to him.|`|xQGkWlSKaa	Don't get involved with the girl and her boyfriend, but you should tell your guy friend that what he is doing is wrong.|`|2vKKLVLKaa	that's a good question.  its like, if you had a serious boyfriend and a girl was messing with him.    but than again everyone would be pissed at you.  you should tell your best friend to back off because its messed up.  but I'm guessing you like this guy? so its more difficult.  because he might think your jealous.  i think you shouldn't pay attention to it.  if he finds out and the girl gets dumped, well that's what she deserves.|`|t1Ve4Nrfaa	you should tell him. he should'nt be cheated on and if he has suspicions then he should know. its the right thing. but if you are worried about your best guy friend getting mad at you and not wanting to talk to you, then you should make sure he really likes this girl first. if hes just asking for benefits because he feels lonely or wants some "fun" with her, then you should tell him. but if he honestly likes her (possibly love but not likely) then you should talk to him about considering to comphront him with the girl themselves. that would make things easier on both guys. the boyfriend would be happy his girlfriend is being honest with him, and the other guy (your friend) wouldnt look like a sleezebag (if anybody uses that term anymore :))    but in the end its what you feel like doing. you could tell him or not. get the other two to tell him or not. just dont do what you wouldnt feel comphortable doing. thats unfair to yourself|`|E6ItVkYjaa	Tell the boyfriend.|`|LlxAgQXPaa	Hi,  You've gotta tell him.. Its unfair, you'd want to know.    :D  -     LiKE.DUDE.|`|TCwf6HXNaa	let the bf in on the info for shizzle doug|`|LH1a7Xuaaa	u need to tell him. its not fair. he needs to know the truth.|`|4c988b1f1dbba6558aaf1b4303565c38aa	if you are a true friend to the guy, you will tell him now that his girlfriend is messing around.  Trust me, there is nothing worse than finding out later down the road, and then finding out that someone close to you knew the whole time!|`|9miZ0betaa	Tell the boyfriend if shes giving the other guy benefits! Good luck!|`|pCfsvdpxaa	SHES A SLUT  TELL ON THAT HOE.|`|Us48srk8aa	It depends on how the guy is. Does he get made real quick or is he really calm. And how much does he know u, so he could trust u. It all depends. I would probably let him find out. Let things turn out the way they have to. :D|`|dar13pmnaa	I would keep quiet for the sake of your best guy friend....u wouldn't wanna issue to arise with him just talk to her and let her know how you feel and let her make the decision rather to be woman enough to make the right choice|`|6e0ab865a90b99b56f310ae0d55e1e11aa	Well first off, I think that if you and her boyfriend are good friends, that maybe you should hint at what is going on. But if not, I think that you should try and convince this guy not to have benefits with a commited person. It will only cause drama, jealousy, and heartache. You could also try to confront the girl about it, and see what happens. To me, the situation is just asking for drama.  I hope everything works out for you.    Good Luck ?|`|aIwJqnn2aa	No offense but you need to mind your own business. It sounds like you like your guy friend and your mad that he didn't want to be with you. If the girl's boyfriend is not your friend and you have no relation to him then you need to stay out of the situation because even if you do tell him that will not stop your friend and this girl plus who knows the guy might resent you for telling him, the girl will want to kick your *** and you may lose a friend in the process.|`|1v5JVuh3aa	If the guy involved is your best friend and you dont  really have a connection with the girl,..Tell the guy..you dont want to loose the friendship with him if finds out you knew all along.

It was bittersweet-I am really close to my family, but my moving out was for a very good reason! *wink*    Though, if I hadn't been getting married, I probably would have saved all my money for another few years, paid down my student loan debt and then bought a condo or a townhome in a couple years.|`|NLKVrdIKaa	I was fifteen and ben on my own a lifetime.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	I was 19 when I moved out and married my first husband.

Not mean rudly, but I am here if you need anyone. Don't fear me. Don't hate me. Im only human. Your friends spoke lies, because I never wanted you for sex. Its impossible when we only did it twice.

Cuz we only hungout one more time after that  oh lol and a friend had another guess sooo 3) he has a tiny pickle or he's gay  though we're both dating other ppl now, i wish we still talked and i wish he knew that i didnt love him cuz idt he loved me, and he doesnt knw i was gonna break up with him, if he knew it'd be more mutual, but he thinks he broke it off  i was his first real gf  he dated my friend in 2nd grade and almost dated a girl a year ago  and my best friend knws all of this though and thinks he's bi and that i gave him confidence to go out with the girl he's with now  which is weird.. i never liked her when i met her. i met her like waaaay before they started going out though  and she has more gums than teeth... idk how he "loves her smile" ... ew  haha but yea  just had to get that off my chest... he really bugs me now though so i"m kinda glad we're not really talking|`|333W9jeCaa	I would want to know why they played me & strung me along the entire time & for them to leave me alone...to cut off all contact & let me live my life, for them to be happy w/ the person they dumped me for & to live with it.|`|YiPR6Dydaa	To Ben:     I don't think that there is anybody who loves you like I do.

nCWjdyddaa	How would you like it if somebody felt entitled to your money? Your parents' money is just that, THEIRS. You do not have an inherent right to any of it. I know that working and going to school is very hard. But, in the end, you will be so glad you did it that way, because only you will be able to take credit for that college degree. Just keep working hard, you'll get there.    SECOND POST: The answer is, no, you can't EXPECT anything. If your parents choose to share with you, that's lovely, and you should be grateful. But you should expect to take care of your own needs. Then, when they do help from time to time, it's a nice surprise. By the way, living at home for a mere $300 a month is help. Even with a roommate, an apartment would cost you at least four times that.|`|AA11185479	You are an adult now.  Your parents are no longer legally required to provide you with anything.  Socially speaking, it's reasonable to expect that your parents will continue to "share the wealth" with you and help you out, but it's not fair to demand it, expect it as your right, or define the limits of that help.    So stop whining and start listening.  Tell your mom that you appreciate all she does for you, and you know you need to provide for yourself, but you would really like to understand why they don't want to give you a car.  Then listen respectfully.  Try suggesting alternative solutions - maybe they buy the car and you "borrow" it - so it is *their* car and *their* property, but you get the daily use of it and pay for the maintenance and gas.  Maybe they buy the car and you pay them back interest-free until you own it.  Maybe your brother's new daily chore is to chauffer you.|`|PZStgtdKaa	You are mad at the wrong person and when you figure out the right person to be mad at forgive yourself.|`|Unbnrwfxaa	If your mother is paying for your schooling than you can't expect her to buy you everything. Being an adult means trying to live on your own. You are lucky enough that you can still live with your mom and not pay rent. Grow up.|`|LMTCohHyaa	That frusterates me as i read it! im 21 and my mother is always telling me i get things for doing things....if i went to school and had a job my mother would be so proud shed prolly build me a house!! but i dont do either so i have no idea y your parents are acting like that------maybe there are some friends you can stay with? because honestly, just to put it bluntly, your parents DONT care where u are or when, otherwise they wouldnt have their"babygirl" doing so much on her own. im sorry that your working so hard,doing everything right, and no one is there to help you. maybe this is God telling you that u should never forget u just have urself in the end.|`|NnMyTBe5aa	If your mom is paying for your tuition then I guess that is enough money to spend on you. You have to understand that college is not cheap. But if your mom is not paying anything then it is very selfish of her. You should try to give her a lesson. It might be bad to make her worry but sometimes people don't appreciate another one until we think we lost them. I am not saying to fake an accident or anything like that but maybe stay with your friends out a little longer one day(always making sure that you are safe of course, never put your life in risk) then you'll see if she worries about you. The outcome could be good or bad but is a risk that you have to take. Again this is considering that she is not paying anything for your tuition.
AA10766729	This web link outlines the applicable and acceptable determining factors for divorce in the state of Ohio. While adultery is grounds for divorce, it is NOT a factor in determining child custody (see page 2).      I don't know what you mean by "monetary compensation" but I would be willing to be the link outlines the questions you have.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	I'm so sorry this happened to your mother and you. I strongly suggest you seek out a grief group and particpate as often as you need it. With or without it though it could take years for you to feel normal again. You will gradually adjust to life without her so it won't be horrible all the time but because you were so close you may never completely get over it. Please get counseling or join a grief group for help.|`|mxrlZEweaa	I felt this way when my dad passed away 8 years ago. You will never get over the death of parent. People think they are saying the right things to you even though they aren't helping at all, "At least she's not suffering anymore", "She's in a better place", "It was her time to go", "Things happen for a reason" I know it's all meant to help you feel better, but it doesn't. There's really no way to make it easier, all you can do is find some way to honor her memory. Find someone you can talk to. If you have to see a therapist that specializes in how to deal with the death of a loved one. It takes time, a long time to come to terms with it. But please don't give up on your friends, they are just trying to help without knowing how to help.     I am very sorry for your loss.|`|DRJtLAooaa	My sympathy goes out to you in the loss of your Mom.  You need to join a grief group so that you can talk about your feelings with other people that are going through the same thing.  I lost my Mom 13 years ago and I still miss her!  You will always miss her too but as time goes by you will find a special place in your heart that she dwells and you will be able to visit her there.  Birthdays, holidays, and Christmas will be very difficult for you but remember it is okay to miss her.  It is okay to grieve for her and it is okay to cry.  I still do sometimes when I talk about her.  We always regret what we could have done when people were here with us but honour her memory by knowing that she loved you and she would want you to be the best person that you can be.  That honours her the most! Get some help to cope - speak with your doctor and talk about your feelings with your friends.  Time does help but for right now you need some help.  She is with you always - never forget that!|`|f2J7jhlraa	im really sorry to hear of this. i wouldnt know how long it will take to get over it-my dad just passed away 6 months ago and to me its getting harder and harder to deal with.my dad died from cancer and im like you my parents are my best friends.iv wondered myself how long should it take but i dont think its really possible to getover the loss of your'parent.sometimes i think i dont want to get over it because it may seem like they wern't important.the best thing i found though to at least cope is to talk with my therapist when i need to.i know i miss my dad soooo much and it makes me scared to think of losing my mom also.i know what you mean when you say it hard to be around people_they do act like its just a part of life to them it is but to us we're dying inside.it seems there,s nothing to take the emptiness away. good luck in your recovery.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I felt the same way when my father passed away.  I was in college & flunked out.  Fortunately times heals things.  Later I got my college degree for myself and to the memory of my father.  It helps if you develop a positive plan of action in life dedicated to your mother's memory.
l3rJFgveaa	call your telephone provider and ask if you can pay that bill seperately.   just go there and pay it yourself.   also what you could do is tell your parents after a friend has come over that she called that phone number. lol and tell them thre will be a bill comingbecasue she/he  did taht..|`|GBqmmtbtaa	you're screwed man! lol! enjoy your imprisonment! lol!|`|EeabLB5eaa	Calmly tell your parents before the bill comes.

Now I recommend and buy it for all my friends and even found a cd of it and pass that around.  It's called:    The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands - by Dr Laura    Good luck!  (I will edit this if you put more details in if you want)    *******ADDITION***********  The book is an easy read - it first off is large type and it's written as to be stories not like a tell you how book but gives situations and some good advice and tips how to handle such a situation.  It's kinda hard to explain cause truly everyone experiences it differently.  It's an easy read - I am not a reader any more than I have to truly and enjoyed it.    Good luck!|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	he is waiting for you to call him as you hung up on him.. it dont matter witch one of you call .. just say you love him then its over with ..|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Well he could have some problems going on at work that he can't talk about ( i know how that is) and he might just be very stressed. Try to talk to him and reassure him you are there for him. My husband gets pissy like that too I just cook him a nice meal and try to talk to him about whats going on    BTW: Go ahead and call him, he probably thinks you are still mad at him|`|H3WHxCgaaa	What should you do?  How about ask him why he's been so defensive and argumentative lately...remind him that marriage is also about communication - and you feel there's a lack of it.|`|TgUOMBIKaa	You love him, and love can help you through this. Just try starting off with the things that mean the most to you about him. The positive. And be positive. Be reassuring, and express your concerns. But listen, with an open mind. Validate his feelings, and tell him this. Ask him to hear you out also. Try spending a romantic weekend together. Maybe, this will help reconnect you.|`|7vt21U1naa	Call him but don't talk to him over the phone about all the issues that you guys have if you do it in person he'll give you straight answers you know..
acb41nHFaa	HE likes you! Even if he is a big flirt.. if he knows you like him and he is still interested its for a reason!|`|wjBKKL2Zaa	Well if hes only been doing things like this to you i would say 100% yess|`|CeBL3HwPaa	He probably does like you.  If he said you were pretty and showed you that much attention,  you can obviously be open with him, and he can be open with you so,  after being in all the relationships I have,  9 months,  7 months,  14 months,  ect.    I think you should be optimistic about it and be happy about it,  because he probably likes you too..  :]|`|0VkZ70f2aa	hmmm, if he's a flirt, he's just looking for a hook-up, sorry dear, stay away from flirts, they always end up hurting you|`|FvGKbFlaaa	Does he do this to all the girls?  Depends. Because, if he does this with all the girls. Don't take it personal, but he is probably just a FLIRTTTTTT!    IMHO.  Addie|`|LLBxpMc7aa	Girrl   Don't get yourself into that. Trust me. Flirts hurt|`|B0KLRK7Yaa	ut his head on your boobs?!?!?! how old are u?!?!?!?|`|tFbdkxyIaa	hard to tell. he's definitely a flirt. he could just want to sleep with you, or he could like you.|`|gSDtwDNcaa	you have to ask? he might be attracted to u. but he put his head on ur chest?! he deffinitely is just a flirt that probably wants to get into ur pants. Take it as a compliment just dont go out with him|`|uTiJhrtAaa	Ummm sounds like to me that he likes you.|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Its probly not what you wanna hear but im the same way except i am just a flirt, so idk i guess u should just ask him and find out|`|YDGuwfZpaa	my money's on "yes" he does,    why don't you just ask him? don't wait for him to get over you.    god i wish i listened to my own advice...|`|hBr3nfaIaa	It sounds like he does if I'm honest.  Think of it this way, could you do that to someone you didn't like that way?  hat's how I work these things out :P    But if he is a flirt, be careful, you don't wanna get hurt.    But still, I think he miiiight [:
K4UmeHyQaa	I think so  tonightt ask him if its you  :)  your so lucky.. he doesnt like me...     Hope you get together
m8UEGUaGaa	There putting band-aids on the wounded marriage. Trying to save face from feeling like they failed, saying its for the kids, and living totally miserable.     NO success stories! Just 808 & Heartbreaks...|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Yes! My husband cheated on me 2 years ago and he's a changed man now. And no, I'm not naive or in denial. He REALLY has changed. It's a long story as to what happened and he didn't have sex witht the woman. (Thank GOD!) Anyways, if the person truly loves you and wants to change, they can. My husband is proof of that. You just have to give them a second chance if you really love them and believe they can change.|`|BlVudiyfaa	I wish I had one...but I do not. I pity the poor bastard that ends up with that woman. He's going to be saddened.|`|YvStROEfaa	I did, and wont again.  Good luck|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	I fished in the Bering Sea....she was messing around while I was risking my life to pay "our" bills.    I found out, I left and with other people, I have learned, she is still a cheat.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I'll be brave and share my story.  I have been married for 5 months and the cheating happened 4 years ago (we have been together for 9 years).  I found out about it, confronted him and then left for two weeks  Did not tell him where I was going, told all my friends and family as well as his family that I did not wish to be contacted but was okay and safe.  I didn't tell them that I was going to be gone for 2 weeks I just left and said I didn't know when I would be back.  After taking the time to cool down and think things through I went back and told him that if he wanted to be with me he needed to change, because the next time I wasn't coming back.  We attended counseling together for about 6 weeks.  It took about 2-3 years after this for me to be able to trust him again.  We are now very happy and I know he isn't cheating on me.  Granted when all this happened we were really young and I felt like most men at his age aren't ready to commit or are scared of commitment and he was acting out.  Now we are both in our 30's and things are great.  Sometimes it does linger in the back of mind, but I try to ignore it.  BUT if it does ever happen again, same thing stands.  I will be gone.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	The jury is still out on that one. He cheated, I let him back but only after 6 month separation and he has only been back 6 months or so. He won't live thru doing it again.|`|fDT0YhROaa	not that i have ever heard...my ex did it over and over till he FINALLY left after I cracked physically...he just wouldn't leave!!|`|4C9U3Xh6aa	Yes. My husband cheated on my 10 years ago. We have been married 11yrs. He has never cheated again. He has no access to internet.I get the cell phone bill.(so I know he doesnt talk to other women)  He gets no credit cards and I know everything he spends.(he cant buy anything for another women) I told him if he ever cheated again I would leave. He has yet to do so.    If they want back in ! keep them on a tight leash. They asked for it. Its called consequences!!!|`|N3ACzplNaa	The only time that ever happens is when the cheating person comes clean and does a 180.  I found out my husband cheated on me several times and since I have found out he hasn't.  We have been in counseling and he evaluated his life and what lead to it.  He is not the same person and if he hadn't changed, I would have left him.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Mine.    My husband cheated very shortly after we got married.  We worked through it, but it literally took years for me to fully trust him again.  He was very open and honest with me, he was an 'open book', but I was still scared.    He's a different man than he was back then and I am a different woman.  Our marriage is also different.  Everything is better.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Yes it is possible that it wont happen again as long as whatever problem they were having that caused them to cheat was improved on. Before i was married i had a emotional affiar with someone else and although tehre was no sex involved it was harmful for my husband as he rather it been sex with no strings. It has never happened again, we learned a lot from it and i knwo it changed us both for the good, i felt he tried harder t omeet my needs and i told him when i was having a problem.|`|3vbHZBioaa	Every person is different some people do cheat over and over again but there are people that have cheated for whatever reason and have come clean and have never cheated again..I would ask what her reasons for cheating in the first place were..did she feel unappreciated? not sexually satisfied? the excitement of another man? Counseling would be a great place to start..but remember men as women have a hard time forgetting if you forgave her and worked on the issue you also need to forget it to move on..Meaning if she is late coming home from work that you don't assume that she was out with another man because that alone will ruin your marriage..Best of Luck|`|Kr09aQJkaa	After we got married and had our first baby I started demanding from him like I was his mother. I'd give commands like PICK UP YOUR SOCKS  HOLD THIS BABY  GO TO THE STORE  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? I was tired from being up with a new baby, jealous he was out at work talking w/ grown ups everyday while I was stuck in the house, and angry he didn't want to take me out. So I bi***ed and nagged him til he was helpful and playing with the baby. When he didn't do what I wanted I would withhold sex. (for months at a time) Two years later he met an ugly (I had to throw that in) woman who was kind, playful and willing to have sex. She made him feel wanted. After he told me what he had done and wanted to repair things I thought no way. I kicked him out. While he was gone I started to think about our marriage. As soon as he put the ring on my finger I became a different person. I used to be kind, playful and sexual. Now I was crabby, hateful, bossy and every time he puckered his lips for a kiss I asked if he had taken out the trash yet. I was a b**** but wanted him to treat me like a queen. I wouldn't have wanted to come home to me neither.  I'm not saying the affair was my fault. He didn't have to go outside the marriage but I understand why he did. I stopped treating him like s**t and he has been faithful ever since. That was 18 years ago.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	My ex 'forgave' me and I never did it again but to this day he believes I cheated on him constantly.  I swear I didn't.|`|Bz21ztapaa	i've been with my spouse for three years, and found out at two years that he was cheating on me for the first year in a half. ouch. it was his ex, and to this day he's still talking to her, i just barely forgave him two months ago, but only because i made his life hell whenever possible and he still stuck around, he repented alright, and has proved to me that he will be faithfull, as for her? she's even crazier than i am, if he wants to be with her, so what, i know he'll die miserable cuz he'll be missing out on me.
N3ACzplNaa	They were different.  People he worked with in the military and got drunk with. He doesn't drink anymore!!!!!  Or hang out with the same butt heads!!|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	I cheated over 6 years ago and me and my husband are still toghether and I never did it again because I know I would loose the best thing that had ever happened to me.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Not from me you don't. If someone cheats, as far as I'm concerned, it is overrrr.|`|L38M9lrLaa	yes it was|`|YvStROEfaa	Different ones.  Good luck|`|5LT6LRUZaa	I think it all depends on the situation and the people in it.    My ex husband cheating on me many many times, he had this "criteria" he expected of me, the moment I did not meet one of his needs he used that as an excuse to cheat on me, I'm not just talking about what was going on in the bedroom, if I wasn't the perfect housekeeper, he used that as a reason, if I complained about the way he spent money that was a reason etc etc    so in his case, he cheats and will use any reason to do so, after years of his cheating I realized that I didn't want to try anymore, that there was nothing that would fix the issues, there wasn't only cheating on his part but also abuse using the same excuses for the abuse, I realized it was done but was terrified to leave, but I ended up having an emotional affair with a man we worked with, that lasted about a year before I finally said I'm outta here...but I was a "whore"  in the ex's eyes....in his mind he did nothing to deserve my disloyalty to him, if you treat your wife/husband like crap then it will be easy for a marriage to end...all it takes is one spouse being at the end of their rope.  If he had treated me the right way then cheating would have never came into our marriage.    I know couples who have survived infidelity, but a lot of changes and work had to be done by BOTH to get through it...in hindsight I look back on my marriage and realize that I should have left him after giving him one more chance instead of 12 chances to stop...since he didn't want to stop or put any work into stopping it forced me to just not care anymore.    other problems in a marriage can and will lead to cheating...it doesn't always have to do with sex...I'm a firm believer that if people bring the worst out of one another then it's time to go their separate ways.|`|fDT0YhROaa	in my case, no. My ex always had new ones - same age group though - 14-20 *sigh*|`|XvUhG1u9aa	No different men.
5LT6LRUZaa	you may not "miss him" as much as you don't want to be alone...only someone who doesn't want to be alone would keep taking this man back after all he's been putting you through...do you love yourself at all???    I used to be the same way with my ex, took him back so many times, I don't actually ever remember being "happy" in that marriage, but I was so terrified I was going to be alone for the rest of my life and that I believed I was stupid, fat, ugly and he was the best I could get, I had to get to a point that I loved myself more than that man ever could love me and to realize that my "reward" for loving him wasn't going to be a life of unhappiness!      That is all you have had with this man, Oh I'm sure there were times he was oh so sweet,  but I live by a new viewpoint now that I didn't have during my marriage, all the sweetness in the world can be destroyed by one act of cruelty, so it doesn't matter the nice things he does because he ruins it as soon as he behaves the ASSHOLE again....it's not your problem that mommy and daddy threw him out....but it's become your problem hasn't it?  No amount of loving him is going to change what he's done to you or his future treatment of you...this type of abuse only gets worse!    your best bet is to cut him completely out of your life once and for all, that means you don't talk to him, you don't ask about him, you do not contact him in any way shape or form, expel this parasite from your life because that is what he's become honey, he's sucking the life force right out of you!   What exactly did you ever do to deserve that sort of cruelty???  For him to bring another woman to the hospital while YOU'RE mourning the loss of your child???  who does that?  HORRIBLE PEOPLE DO THAT that's who!  you have to be willing to love yourself more than you could ever love him or he could ever love you, once you do you will realize more than just you never deserved that treatment from him, you will learn that you deserve SO MUCH BETTER!  once you realize you do deserve better you will find better, but you're never going to get there if he's in your face all the time, so push him out of your life once and for all, don't fall for the "I'm going to kill myself" routine from him...it's something he uses because he knows it will work, he's manipulating you!  The next time he says it I would tell him not to make a mess!  Sometimes sweetheart being a b*tch is all a girl has to hold onto and in this situation it's time for you to be a B*tch!    get as far away from him as you can and GET YOURSELF BACK!|`|6P5mNLt0aa	I would put him out, remember honey he wanted you to kill yourself. So you are dead to him, so don't feel guilty that he doesn't have a place to go. you deserve better.|`|hiyWWKdNaa	well,  you just need time away from this GUY.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	I'm sorry, but I have no answer to your question... After all of that, I can't imagine why you would want him back...|`|wpi36XBAaa	"I feel guilty for him having no where else to go but when i am around him i dont feel sexual attracted to him anymore. But when i tell him to leave i start to miss him and want him. WHY?"  Why does it happen that way? Because the image, the way you imagine you want him to be, doesn't match the reality of who he is. What you want from a relationship isn't there.   Its easy enough to pretend when he's not really there - through texts, emails etc. but harder to do when faced with the reality of him actually being there, ignoring your needs and making himself his first and only priority. What you wish he was isn't who he is. Its that simple.   And you don't want to let go of the "hope" that he will become what you need, even though he hasn't worked on changing anything about himself. You want to deny the reality for the fantasy. Its not working for you.  You want to see him as a white knight when you know he's a lying cheating bastard who will use you only until he can find something better for himself, at which time he will leave you high and dry AGAIN.  It is time to say "Enough, I deserve better than this. Sob story or no, you've got to go!" Cut the ties, because he will keep using you for as long as you let him.|`|7jA1FiY8aa	He's a jerk.  Dump him and move on.  You deserve way better, and you know it.  It's not HIM you miss, it's just HAVING someone that you miss.  Get rid of him, give yourself time to heal and get your head together, and go meet some who is honest, supportive, and loving.  That's a REAL relationship.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You want him because your favorite fairy tale is beauty & the beast: you have the fantasy that your love can magically transform this monster into a prince.  I think you should use immersion therapy on yourself to cure this: spend every waking minute possible either with him or talking to him on the phone.  Get near him and stay near him until you get so sick of his crap that you finally could no longer miss him when he was gone.|`|yAZq4SLaaa	WHAT are you thinking!!!??? This guy is a total loser! GET OUT of that mess! You need to remember EVERY text and message he or his sluts have ever sent you, get angry and STAY rid of him! You deserve better..Good luck.
Lahpeewyaa	I've been in that boat before and I can relate. However the situation wasn't as serious; it was his ex of only about a year and instead of asking forgiveness she let him know if he wanted her, he could have her. We really do love each other and he didn't do anything other than keep the conversation from me for a few months-- I know he can't stand her anyway because she had also cheated on him.     When he finally told me I was pissed that he kept it from me-- we share everything-- he gave about the same reason as your bf, he didn't know how I would act, if I would be angry or upset. The only reason I was angry with him was because he choose not to tell me, if it wasn't for that I would have just been extremely pissed at his ex.     If it was reversed he wouldn't have been to happy either. If I was you I would make it extremely clear that unless he can be completely honest he will loose you and give him the cold shoulder for awhile, let him know that he was in the wrong. If he really cares about you he will go through the trouble of sending flowers, sincerely apologizing, working things out and getting closer to you. I hope this was helpful...good luck!|`|y5P4dY7aaa	Nothing you just say you understand don't stoop down to his level just because you know he would get mad if it were you.  She is married now and he is with you, so it meant nothing, she just wanted to say she was sorry.|`|m1IQDoUAaa	tell him how you are feeling!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then ask him to be more honest from now on!!!!!!!|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	He may not have told you cause she no longer means anything to him and he didn't think it was an issue.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	Tell him (calmly) that there shouldn't be a next time like this but if there is he should feel like he can talk to you and you should feel like you can trust him.  If he doesn't think he can tell you little things like "I talked to my ex today, nothing happened but she said this" then you will start resenting him and it will be hard to trust him.  Then explain that you can't have a relationship without trust, so he has to choose if he wants to grow up and start discussing things with you, or risk hurting you the next time he pulls a stunt like that.  I am sure if you explain how hurt you are and exactly why, he will apologize and learn his lesson!  P.S.  That totally sucks what he did... but honestly nothing really huge happened so discuss it with him, then move on.  No need to be pissed forever!!!|`|DptJXo7Caa	dont worry.... chillllllllllllll.    he didnt tell you immediately because he didnt think it was a big deal: shes married, he has you, its all over and done with.     the fact is, he did eventually tell you. he isnt trying to keep secrets. yeah it might have been nicer to tell you the day of, but how annoying would you have been? i think hes just trying to make it easier on you (and in turn, him) by waiting before telling you.    unless anything happens, or he was talking about her over-lovingly, then you really shouldnt have anything to worry about      let this one go|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	Ok, ya i've had this happen, but in the end we've been together over a year, i live with him, and you know what, in the end it doesnt matter, shes moved on, he's moved on, and he's with you. You're gonna be upset about it, and then blow it off, its just one of those things he didnt want to hurt you with, 1) hes protecting you, 2) its gonna hurt 3) it was 3 months ago, its over  with, have a talk with him, tell him it hurt that he wasent straight up and honest, and that you would like him to be completely straight forward now, even if it is something thats gonna bother you, you would prefer to know right, so it doesnt happen like this again...|`|fIHCoValaa	why does it bug you so much if she's married and he chooses to be with you?  if you ran into an ex, you wouldn't think it was a big deal just like he though.  get over it.|`|c86Xm3Jiaa	so your upset because your bf ran into his ex months ago and didnt tell you?  wow.  jealousy is a nasty attribute young lady.  I suggest you find real problems to focus your rage on.
EsaFg8eaaa	shes drama? is that what you want for the rest of your friendship? It sounds like highshool in 5 years you wont be friends|`|PCpC4iS1aa	oh yeah she sure is|`|w4dmRE3Waa	confront her and explain to the  guy flirting with you that u havea boy friend|`|HRNuIW4jaa	yes jealous. but not of you.|`|uOrzoecPaa	she jealous that u have aboyfriend and not her
QvhPJAKyaa	wh dont ou just get him a cute tedd that sas 'i love ou'.  something like that probabl means more, than an actual present like jeweller or something x
UHc3Nvaqaa	I would actually prefer the girl to make the move.|`|g9wjFB3laa	idk i always let the guy ask me out because i would be embarrassed if he said no. but if i like him, id definitley say yes to him. if you are sure you know he likes you and hes too shy to admit it or ask you out, i say GO FOR IT!!! ;o) lol|`|zxa2fjpyaa	Guys ask girls out most of the time because i guess its "traditional" but sometimes the guy is too shy so the girl would ask the guy out. I think it doesnt matter whether a guy or girl asks the other person out.|`|zdlS3fgDaa	No, a lot of girls at my school are the ones that ask the guys out. Some guys like it better that way. It just depends.|`|Zv7sXMbTaa	I live in new york and find that when i go out guys rarely ask a girls out i find girls asking guy out more. there is nothing wrong with a girl asking a guy out, its great it shows your in charge of your own life! do it up!!!!!|`|eaoLopElaa	My now ex girlfriend was the one that did the asking...so obviously, it can go either way.|`|5SspTGl1aa	Its totally fine|`|EdidZdtlaa	yea it could go both ways
GyFwkIbEaa	umm... well you can try talking to him.... i know you said that he doesnt really do that... but just ask him what his problem is... it might be because his girlfriend maybe gets jealous and doesnt like him talking to other girls... if you know his girlfriend you can also ask her...  or just put like a note in his locker or something|`|LmAetZT7aa	its his girlfriend for sureee, talk to her about it. and ask her whats going on.. and ask if she has a probably with you and him being best friends. and if she does, you should tell her that she has nothing to be worried about and yall were just really good buds. then, talk to him and let him know what he is doing is wrong and that you miss him as a buddy. it should work , totally.    good luck bbyy girl (:      hope this helped bunches!|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	it's most likely his girlfriend who is not letting him talk to you.
zDT4AgGcaa	try okcupid.com    great website. must be 18+ to use though, and for a guy it can be tough to chat with the girls, because they get bombarded with all kinds of messages and creepers. I'd recommend it though. Find a hot pic of yourself and make your profile freaking interesting. Don't be a creeper.
AG3dYL84aa	Don't worry I'm not your Matt.  LOL    This is when you need to start learning how to use your feminine wiles.  You need to flirt in a more relationship type way by turning the conversation into something sexy.  Not lewd or bowdy.  Just more boy girl type things.    But the key is you need to be subtle.  Boys love subtlety because it very feminine.  Do not be overt by your flirting.  Just change things slightly.  Don't worry.  He'll notice.  But let him come on to you.  Remember boys like to do the chasing, not to be chased.     So learn to use those feminine wiles well so you can attract a boy to go after you while he thinks he thought he made the first move.  It's hard.  But you'll learn it for later good use.  Good luck.
LmAetZT7aa	what always works with me, is you should send him a cute text message in a middle of a conversation.. like out of no where, and put "soo... who do you like? :D" like that and see what he says back. and if he asks why you should be like "well, ive been kinda thinking. me and you are really good friends and we talk alot and um.. i kinda sorda.. like you (: " that should work! try it :D    good luckk 
AA10699863	don't know emo people are kinda hard to get along with and everything their to self destructive and they must constantly reinforce their image of theirselves as emotional, misunderstood, alone, and bad A.|`|d5bd64efb7682148a6c0f51b553f4a48aa	just cause you say your not labeling does'nt mean your not labeling.
2855db272602388753b83d34dfd795f7aa	Aww,   Call him & ask him if you two can meet up, if he says yes then just spill all of your feelings for him! don't hold back! but if he says no, then send him a message explaining every thing or just keep calling him! don't give up if you truely think he's some one special....    ?-Love- ?|`|AA10681482	Think through the reasons that you felt you couldn't trust him.  Have they been resolved?  What about the reasons he didn't trust you?  Do you think he will be able to get over them and have a trusting relationship now?  If you haven't resolved your differences.... you need to work on that first.  Text him and ask him to talk.  Tell him you want to work things out.  IF that is something he wants, he will respond.

llORubzJaa	First off there is nothing wrong with you and your past relationship has alot to do with it, trust i'm there right now and I know he loves me to. Just take day by day and just trust him I guess there is nothing you can do to stop thinking about her it's only natural. Just remember they broke up because they didn't want to be together and he's with with YOU now. Good Luck Casey:)|`|c3LiEn5baa	Have someone shake the living daylights out of you.  If that doesn't help get some counseling.    Get a grip.  Really.|`|ILf5i3LNaa	nothing is wrong with you but you need to stop. what if he were feeling the same way about your ex? you would think its stupid probably|`|iRNWjoZZaa	don't sweat it if he did youd know it*|`|is6Mnti0aa	I dont know what your hang up is. I guess to some degree its normal to wonder about the exes, but why are you focusing on this particular ex? Did he say something about her that made you feel like she was a threat. If thats the case, just tell him how you feel. I am sure he will clear it up for you and let you know that you have nothing to worry about. not only will it get the issue out there, it will resolve it and lay the groundwork for an open homest relationship. Otherwise, its going to drive you crazy and he will never know what the deal is, and thats not fair to either one of you. Good luck!|`|ab7L3z5taa	Sounds like you are insecure,but calm down honey you need to understand that in  this life the  only way to get to your prince charming is to kiss some frogs.|`|hfLIxuOeaa	Your feelings are somewhat normal since you have been a   bad relationship. Television and the media always portray women to be green and  psychotic when it comes to infidelity and ex- girl friends but the truth is that bad relationships turn us into that. Anyway, the fact of the matter is if your boyfriend was still thinking and missing this  girl he would be with her instead of you. And since you say that you have no reason to believe this then you have no worries.  In time you will get over your obsession with his ex girlfriend as your love grows for each other. Good luck and remember there is a special reason why your boyfriend is with you and not someone else  when you learn to accept this you will be just fine.|`|EZ4HoyP8aa	LOOK, YOUR PAST HAS MADE YOU THIS WAY AND ITS MAKING YOU A BIT INSECURE AND THATS OK|`|NYERewvlaa	It is normal to be insecure after a previous relationship where you were hurt, cheated on, or abused in some way.  You are the only one who can be in control of this situation though-and you must decide whether dwelling on this is worth your stress or this new relationship.  Take it one step at a time...when you start to think about it-tell yourself in your mind, to stop.  Then force your mind to remember something wonderful and positive about you and this new boyfriend, and why you care about him.  Keep reinforcing the positive things to fight off the negative thoughts that you keep worrying about .  You are the only person who will be able to teach this to yourself......and it is not easy, but it will help to re-teach yourself in trust, and that no two people are the same, and neither are relationships.|`|wxgfrZIMaa	I understand.  I had a similar problem with my husband and his ex-ex girlfriend.  I'm very jealous anyway.  It took me a while to realize it but she may have loved him and he may have loved her but she can never ever love him the way I do plus he chose me it wasn't a competition with her but still out of all the women in the world he chose me.  Good luck.|`|x86CMrUHaa	Awww hun you have already answered your own question.  It is the bad relationship you had which has left you insecure.  You can't know 100% if your boyfriend is trustworthy, no one can, we just have to take a chance and trust them hun and that is what you have to do.  This guy is with you, not with his ex and he is with you because he wants to be with you and not her or anyone else.  Don't let that bad relationship ruin the relationship you have now and don't allow yourself to get hung up about your boyfriends ex, if you feel you are going to check her account do something else instead.  I think this is happening now though because you are ready to emotionally take the next step in your relationship and emotionally commit even more and maybe that is frightening you and that is why the insecurity is cropping up now.  Remember that you are a beautiful person inside and out and that the memories of what you have been through are just that memories, don't let them take over now that you have come so far.  You don't need to keep checking her account hun, she is your fellas past, you are his future x|`|AA11352641	I've been in a similar situation where a former relationship is at the back of my mind constantly. I found my ex-bf new gf on myspace and realized that they'd been together for years, the whole time we were together. Although I don't him one bit, it crushed me. It's distracting, bothersome, and stressful. Oh yeah and she's 15 years older than me and looks like she's stuck in the 80's. I thought to myself "Am I in THAT league?" I couldn't help but study every detail of her profile, as well as her friends.     I'd try to swallow this one without saying anything. It sounds like one of those insecurities that sneak up and you just can't reason with yourself. You don't want to interject this insecurity or have him feel accused when it's all good right now. Also, myspace is internet crack. It's too easy and too available. Do all that you can to not look at her profile. Out of sight, out of mind, right? If you just give yourself time to forget about it, you probably will.     You know something else? He might think of her, and he might even miss her. But that doesn't mean he'd go back there.  Every relationship in his past formed the person you know today. It sounds like you are really inflating this problem in your head and lending it a lot of power. Keep in mind that this is an imagined problem, not a real one.|`|AA11999780	your mom and friends are wrong. sure, it's a little weird that you check her myspace, but the feelings you have are normal. what you need to do (even though it will be hard) is talk to your boyfriend about it. explain that it isn't that you don't trust him, but you haven't had luck in this department in previous relationships and it would make you feel better if he could assure you. if your relationship is as good as you describe, he should have no problem at all. i was worried about my boyfriend cheating on me (not because of him, but because of a previous relationship, like you) but once i got up the courage to talk to him about it, he didn't say it was stupid or anything. he just told me he would never do that and i had nothing to worry about.|`|AA12191095	communicate with him about this but dont scare him. also, do you invest too much of your values in him? do you judge yourself by how other people see you? do you have a busy and rewarding school/career/social life?|`|707f0ab7f7f341b47c1798aca2a215a1aa	try doing an extra credit project and try not to think about him and if you do maybe you still have some unresolved questions with him that need answering!!!!!! just do not thnk about him!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10228553	There is nothing wrong with you but you need to get over this.  The last thing you need is to have your worries start causing problems with your own relationship.  (I've had this happen to me in the past).  You're letting your fears get the best of you when there is nothing to back them up.  Every time those thoughts come into your head, you have to shut them out by telling yourself that they are not true and you shouldn't even be thinking that way.  If you work hard at it, you can get rid of the thoughts forever.

I would ignore her and i regreted it becuase she was like the Best freind forever to me. Your friend will get over it and relize that she wants to be your frind still. The reason i didnt become frinds with this girl for so long is because of my other frind witch was wrong  of me because my other frind and my best freind hated each other. everything will change and you will become best friends with her again.

AA11175124	I once filled out a thing called a Dating Application.  It's actually title was:  Dating Application for girls wishing to date returned missionaries from the New Jersey South Mission   or something like that.  But I don't think that matters, because you may not understand all that.  You can ask, though.  It was hilarious and fun and got me a date.  There were funny questions mixed in with serious ones, so it was fun and came off like a joke, even though they really wanted to know some of the answers.  And the funny ones made it so they could kind of gauge our personalities.  I was glad there was nothing embarrassing or innappropriate on it, so it didn't seem creepy.  Also, the lightheartedness made it so they didn't seem cocky or full of themselves.

AA11175124	Um, well...Let me ask:  Is the reason you never really talked much because she took it badly when you told her you liked her?  Also, shy don't you really talk back to her now?  I think you should start with getting some confidence, talking to her like a friend or something, get to know her, then see if she's still ALL THAT to you, then ask her out if she is.  My Space can get complicated.  You can't read peoples expressions or tones and things on a computer, and things just get confused.  But, if you were going to send her a message, just say something like, Hey!  Fancy meeting you here!  So, you fell into the My Space addiction, too, I see.  What's goin on?  Later.  Or something just simple and stress free.  Something she won't read into.  Good luck!|`|AA12290315	just be yourself, think of what you'd say if she were in front of you and then post that... if that makes you uncomfortable, then just drop a quick hello and let her know, you were happy to find her there now it will be easy to keep in touch with her...|`|jo8Opsiyaa	Best way to tell her how you feel, first do it in person, it may be nerve wracking but is well worth!

I don't like endless piercings either, just one ear lobe at the most, maybe eyebrow.  I prefer them tanned, but any skin tone is fine.  And sexiest body part.. has to be a sixpack!

Invite your neighbors over to your house for a block party / cook out. Introduce yourself to other people and when you find a similar interest (like, golfing or such) then ask them if they'd be up to going to the driving range with you some night.     Find a hobby. Like playing an instrument, Civil War Reinactment, Golfing, Joining a church league baseball team for adults, etc. and join a group that does that.     Invite the parents in your son's class at school over to your house for a drop in social of cookies and punch.     Tell your spouse that you'd like to invite their friend and husband/wife over or out.     Join a church with a group that fits your spot in life. Lots of churchs have "dinner clubs" for adults.     Start a group in your neighborhood or complex that is going to start walking together  or biking together every evening.

We were watching land before time, and I was trying not to cry when little foot's mom dies.  I was sitting with Bryan (a little 3 yr. old my mom used to baby sit) in the rocker and he looked at me and said, "Don't cry!"  and layed a wet one on me.  I thought we were going to get married.

It was a huge wedding. and cost 30000 dollars anyways it is your day and you get to choose what you want. Good luck!|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	you can have both be your maids of honor and tell them that you love them so much that you want it that way   Good luck in you future|`|SFHOx2yNaa	There is no set rule you can not have two maids of honor!

I say have both of then so there wont be no problems.Good Luck|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Choose them both and have them share the honor. It is a sign of the times that the modern wedding is what the bride and groom want to make of it. It is ok to throw out any old dated traditions you don't like and keep the ones you do. Who says you can't have two maids of honor?|`|46StihsPaa	Choose your best friend. Your longest best friend. Tell your sisters you couldn't choose between them.
GTjkWZPlaa	I can't believe you even have to ask this question.  Absolutely not.  She's married, and to your brother.  You should be loyal to your brother.  If the tables were turned, what would you want your brother to do, if it was your wife?   Not to mention, if he ever found out, your relationship with him will never be the same.  Is it really worth it?    If it was me, I would take this one step further and tell your brother about her proposal to you.|`|Ow5gSrAQaa	tell your bro what the ho is doing before she does more damage to his life.  he needs to get the hell out of that marriage.  what nerve she has.|`|11qdMtlGaa	You are going to do what you want not what anyone on here says but just think if the roles were turned around that you just got married to a "stone cold fox" and were out of town and came back to find out your brother slept with your wife how would you feel? and again if this was happening to you wouldn't you want to know?  Plus much do you love your brother because in the end isn't he the one that is going to get hurt? or your family? sometimes you have to think about what might be the best thing to do in a situation like this just some things to think about|`|0bf8b29ed2b052955105afb4f7e2894aaa	OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Are you kidding??????????????????|`|N3ACzplNaa	Did you lose your morals the day she touched your leg?  This is your brother's wife your talking about here.  What if your brother did that to you?  How would you feel?  If she is coming onto you like this, who else is coming on to.  Why don't you acted like a real brother and tell his wife to leave you alone and you might even talk to your brother about her behavior.|`|TI65WNunaa	If this is true what kind of brother are you?  How or why would you ask if you should go over and sleep with your brothers wife.  Do you care about him at all.  He probably trusts that you would never do something so deceitful and hurtful behind his back.  You need to let her know that you will tell him if she even suggest such a thing again.  This is one of the saddest questions I have read here in answers where is your morals, self respect, or dignity.  I cant think that anyone would want to have a BROTHER like you.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	She sounds like a stone cold tramp to me.  RUN......Your brother is way more important than her.    And tell him what a tramp he married so he can RUN too.|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Tell your brother! She's going to damage the whole family!|`|8FO52r0Maa	um say no, good lord|`|cdpy5iv5aa	Dude WTF is the matter with you, that's your brother's wife, you need to tell him, she is most likely banging other dudes while your brother is away on business.|`|k8YVp9gKaa	Really your choice is very simple.  You can over and bang your brother's wife the tramp.  Of course when he finds out you will have destroyed your relationship as well as the entire family.  Or you can decline the tramps generous offer and remain tight with your brother.  That is the options available to you.    Now the fact that you consider meeting her, or even ask for help in your decision, indicates that you and her have more in common than thought.  Skank.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	NO.....LOL, nice brother you are, nice wife she is|`|aAPkpuhqaa	Uhmm.....hes your brother??!?!??!?!  you really have to ask?  shes his WIFE. that kind of qualifies for off limits  tell your brother about it XP    anyone with common sense and morals would know...jeez|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Don't mess with her. She is a Ho. You may break your family up over it. Don't do it.|`|faOBk7qtaa	She has issues, and you have even bigger ones for even considering this.    As a single person I always say "get with who you want" married or not it doesn't matter because you are single. But never with a spouce of your family member. That is just wrong.|`|v6MvF2Mgaa	Stop reading penthouse forum and get back to reality sparky! Those french fries aren't going to cook themselves!
1OJNgIVyaa	I feel the same as you I am a lot more comfortable when with one or two close friends than in a big group. I'm not very confident and I hate that I've been trying to overcome that in lessons by saying at the beginning of the day I'll put my hand up for two answers today and then if I manage it then I move on to a higher number the next day. It works for me. In a big group try and get to know the people individually so that you can be more ocnfident around them and then when they are all together it should be easier. Your not alone don't worry xx|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	Dont knock yourself out. Dont push yourself on people, just be yourself.  Think of it this way: If you like me fine, if not thats fine too. People will come to you eventually. You are not unique in this respect. Many people have confidence problems. Your thoughts, your feelings and who you are, are quite important, you as a person are important. Assert yourself.|`|51ne4RkHaa	you need to take out the crazy in you!!!|`|wTMMG0enaa	trying hanging around your close friends more and tell them about how you feel. and focus on the positive things about you and all the things you can do, your only bringing yourself down more if you focus on the negatives. Don't worry about speaking in lessons (?) or in big groups because their a lot of people out there who are like that, and don't worry about getting a boyfriend i'm sure you'll find one that likes you for who you are someday. :-)|`|r3uKj1Azaa	Take up drama, or go to a youth theatre group or something like that. Honestly, that will build up your confidence no end!|`|wS4ilryWaa	1) Tell yourself every morning how gorgeous you are.  2) Trust people will love the real you.  3) Expand your social circle, making you seem a more rounded, confident person.  4) Pretend you're confident, pretty soon you'll act it!  5) Take up a new hobby, find something you have a talent for.|`|GPeYqjbBaa	You must be confident in yourself first.Look in the mirrow and tell yourself you are confident.Smile at yourself and tell yourself you look good.Be possiive and say can do instead of can  not do.Don't worry too much as that may make it worse.When you go out,tell yourself you are beautiful and happy with you.Try to get involved with others and do not feel afraid to talk to others.You will soon have confidence if you feel you are happy with yourdself.Good luck
YVJQ7Y4jaa	Your situation is terrible. I would take each one aside alone and talk with them about the problem. Why were they living in hotels? Same problems?  Sleeping all the time. Sounds as if they are deeply depressed. Why not talk to a psychotherapist explain the problem and get some understanding of their condition.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Kick them out and start your own life???Obviously they need a " WAKE UP CALL" LOL!!You can`t live your life with takers and users. It`s frustrating and fruitless. Think of all the things you could be accomplishing??Some folks are never motivated unless they are pushed to do so. How much of your life are YOU going to be depressed because of their depression??
GmTMVmASaa	the worries are natural, and guilt is a useless emotion. your mother will be okay, and yes you do need to live your life.
ub2Dtzn0aa	It sounds like you have taken a good first step. Your admitting that at least part of the problem is your inability to control your outbursts. In addition you made a proactive choice to address the issue by making an appointment to be evaluated. That is the most important thing right now. Whatever happens between you and your husband as far as staying together, you've begun the process of improving yourself. If your honest with him and FOLLOW THROUGH with your effort to address your issues then he should feel obligated to take a look at himself for whatever part he may play in your relationship troubles.    Let him know that your going to address your problem to try and improve not only yourself but your relationship because it means that much to you. After that its in his hands and you need to make yourself the best person you can for either being his wife or moving on in your life.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	if you already know what your problems are and how to fix them, then you don't need help from people on Yahoo.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	He married you in sickness and in health.  Bi-Polar disorder is an illness and you are doing what you need to do to get into a healthy routine.  Let him know all of this, and you keep doing the things that will make you healthy and easier to live with.  I hope he will understand.|`|bO2rzfISaa	A psychologist is a waste of time. Go straight to a psychiatrist. If you are bipolar, you need medication to get it under control, and psychologists can't prescribe it.    There are good books on this topic. One is, "An Unquiet Mind," By Dr. Kaye Redfield (unsure about the name) who has bipolar herself.|`|XAetFJXsaa	Sounds to me like it wouldnt hurt if you sounded a little dersperate. You can't let your pride hold you back when it involves somebody you love...he needs to know that you truly love him and that you would do anything to make your relationship work. Recognizing that you need to see a psychologist is an amazing step, I think he will appreciate your effort and if you explain to him all that you are feeling and why you think you're having these outburts then he should do all that he can to support you.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Not only are you bipolar, you're at the very least, physically abusive.    I hope that he leaves you and I hope that you get the help that you need.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Actions speak louder than words. You recognize your problem and are taking steps to deal with it. He is your husband and whether you sound desperate or not, what does it matter ? Talk to him calmly over the issue and ask for his patience. You want to change and you want to repair the damage in your relationship with him. Ask for his support.    In the meantime, when sensitive issues arise and you feel your temperature rise, heart rate increase, excuse yourself from the situation. Take a time out and return to the issue when both of you are calm and can discuss it rationally. The big thing is to recognize the feelings you have prior to an outburst, and nip it in the bud before you verbally express it. It takes practise. Hope this helps.|`|b072771e0ce9d50e2eb422756b55e11eaa	You are doing all that you can do now.  Just tell him you are taking care of the problem.|`|OBCvewW2aa	They keep accusing me of being bipolar too! Meh.. you call it mental disease, I call it excitement.     Doesn't he have to abide by the sickness and in health clause or did you marry the quick to run type?|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	I'm sorry, you may not be able to control how you feel, but you can control how you react to your feelings. And bi-polar disorder does not give you a license to treat people badly. So you've finally admitted that there is a problem and that is a huge step, now you need to work on you and learn how to control yourself. If its meant to be, he'll come back. That's what it truly means to love someone, the fact that you are willing to let them go so they can be happy. That alone may help him see that you are willing to work on yourself and try.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	tell him that you are getting help for it.  It could  be a chemical inbalance.  My cousin used to do things like that and then feel terrible about it afterwards.  He takes medication now and is just fine.  Good luck and I hope that you can get your problem under control.|`|YvStROEfaa	I'm bipolar also. Its hard isnt it.   Just try to hold  back. I understand that you cant control it sometimes.  Maybe you should bring up some info on the symptoms of bipolar...let him read it...but unless he has it too he will never truely understand.   Good luck|`|AkUhaMm9aa	just sit down with him and tell him what you told us, that you know this behavior isn't normal and you dont mean to be like that..and that you are trying to get help.     ask him if hes willing to be supportive because you need him more than as a husband as a friend then he wont see you so desperate if things work out then you can talk about fixing your relationship with him...for now..tell him you need his support..im sure he'll help you get through this.      good luck|`|5jMNBO2naa	i have a hard time believing that  sorry i do not buy bi polar anything  there are plenty of people in far worse conditions who do not go flying off the handle  they have learned to accept what is there and no go into rage mode  maybe you lack communication skill sets ( likely ), the ability to think logically (  as opposed to emotionally ), so in frustration you go manic  you need counseling , but no for bi polar, but for life  skill sets you sorely need, i would not blame you husband if he does leave you, no man needs unnecessary drama, no matter what the excuse|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	When the love and trust you have given to a partner has gone, it may be difficult to restore, and carry on a marriage. You deserve respect for recognizing your condition  caused marital problems, and for seeking medical help. But you cannot think everything is perfect again.    Good Luck    God Bless|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Give him space to feel his legitimate feelings of hurt and anger.  You have mistreated him.  Work on getting yourself better first.  Then if he will take you back you will be able to focus on the relationship and giving him what he needs.|`|yyIVrngcaa	I know exactly how you feel, I've flipped out like that with my bf for no big reason when we were living together for 3 months. (seemed longer)  He ended up leaving me (moving out of the apartment) because    1) I would talk down to him constantly  2) our place was an hour away from his work and he had to take the bus to work   3)I laid my hands on him    I know I have problems wether it be I am just some psycho who needs to be constantly given attention and love or I am really Bipolar    a) He is back in my life, (we were only apart for a month)   b) he told me the reason he left was because things were getting too crazy and He felt if he wouldve stayed he woulda hit me back..    Things are now better than before and I am controlling my temper..    If this is not something you can manage yourself, seek help.    best of luck to you and your relationship.|`|VUqlQmJcaa	Jumping on board with doing everything he would like/want isn't a solution either, you need to tell him that you flipped out, you're sorry and that you will TRY to control it and are seeking help from this point on. From a guys perspective I have to say making a little nookie time wouldn't hurt and then in the afterglow you can tell him what happened and why and apologize.
VxC09hX5aa	She has more experience in bed , it much easier for women to have sex but most lie about the actual   if she say she's been with 5 you can bet it's 25,  i found out a lot about her after i married her she just like the merry go round every one had a turn..  FN ho.|`|BlVudiyfaa	well, that makes you wife of the century.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Love this question.  Married 20 years.  The other night lying in bed right after we connected, I told her that for just one night I wish we could switch bodies.  I really want to know what it feels like for her.  I hope it feels as good for her as it does for me but I will never know.  She says she loves *** and *** and *** but how do you honestly compare the way she makes me feel to the way I make her feel?    >>>>>>>>>>>> to Amber who said it is "pretty basic"  If you keep gently asking questions, do you like this, how about that, what about this other thing I can do, eventually you learn how to bring the other person incredible physical joy during foreplay and sex.  My wife is so talented that after 20 years I am glad I am still in great shape because at the end I literally feel as if the fabric of the universe is collapsing in around me.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Is it some sort of competition?|`|bO2rzfISaa	We're well matched.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	definitley not I was a virgin when I met my husband and he wasnt so he has alot more experience than I do. he told me he was sexually active at the age of 12 I thought that was kind of rediculous|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	It's not a matter of him being better than me or vice versa. We play our roles very well. So we work well together, I guess you could say. When we first met, we both expressed that the other was one of the best they'd ever had, except that he meant that I was overall one of the best and I meant that head-wise (BJ) he was the absolute best.|`|L38M9lrLaa	pretty much he was boring times 20 in bed before me|`|f6YsGOynaa	I am too.  Some days I'm so good, I'd much rather just be with ME than waste the perspiration on him.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	yeah,my fault. i was a man whore.but she is pretty naughty now.|`|AA10962298	Good for you...now he can use that to please someone else who will view him as more of an equal.|`|AA11969451	I didn't know it was a contest. We both had previous experiences that we brought to our relationship and we are fantastic in bed as a couple. We communicate verbally as well as physically and it makes it all the better.|`|y9CgveCGaa	She probably is, but, she doesn't brag about it.|`|ojiO3svoaa	i was pretty much the sh*t and my boyfriend is a rock star! yeah me!!|`|XTDeAfTqaa	I'm so much better that I call out my own name when I'm cumming.    jk  We've been together for 16 years and we are great together.

For all of the guys she claimed to have banged in the past.  She only knows about 3 positions.    I have basically taught her a couple more.|`|yAZq4SLaaa	It doesnt sound like you had an honest question...sounds like you just wanted to brag..your ego certainly doesnt suffer any.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Im not sure :p more experienced yes, But i don't like sex much :/ sad i know. I want more than just sex, I doubt just because I guy can stick his thing in a girl and *** that makes him a better lover as well.|`|KAoNgzcFaa	I think so but it's been so long since we have had sex with each other so i wouldn't know for sure but i believe so.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	I think that we're about the same.  We are equally into each other and making sure the others needs are fulfilled.  We communicate.  That's what sex in marriage should be, I think.  There's no need to dictate instructions to the poor guy... or else he'll think he's just too dumb for sex...and let's face it... it's pretty basic.
GeruGGOQaa	Spoken like a true woman.  Men don't get hints if you want something from us just say so.  Once you tell him once that's what you want more than likely it will do it from time to time without you having to ask for it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You may try asking "What do you think about doing X, Y or Z?"    Or, "It's always fun to "    But truthfully, direct communication is always better than indirect. This way you can get the answer straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak; you won't have to guess, he won't have to guess. Subtly hinting and hoping he gets it will only lead to frustration.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	My husband is the same way and i also have never said no to him because i love making love with him and during our whole marriage i have initiate about 90% of the time but there has been many many times that he has initiate but its still me most of the time and when i do initiate he is ALWAYS ready and has never said no to me...I know he wants me and still finds me attractive and it use to bother me but i figure since he always responds then i guess i will just have to be the initiator and it doesn't bother me anymore.    If your husband responds to you when you initiate then just keep on doing it because it doesn't matter who initiates as long as your still making love.    Dont let your pride get in the way...I told my husband numerous times in the past that he should initiate more and he said he would but nothing changed and i just learned to accept that this is going to be the way it is.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Communication, the key to a successful marriage.  Tell him, talk to him about your needs. Get him to talk about his.  Don't just assume he knows what you want and is magically going to do it.  COMMUNICATE.  Red|`|UNZuciedaa	just whisper in his ear that you've left the back door unlocked|`|AA10873763	If you don't want to bring it up directly, look for ways to comment on it indirectly.  Say you're watching a movie together with a steamy scene where the action plays out in the way you would like.  Make a comment, like "Wow, that's hot!", or something like that.  Hopefully he will follow up and ask if that's something you would like, but if not at least you have planted the seed for him to think about.  Talk about fantasies with him, tell him a story about "a friend", etc.  Good luck.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	If you want this...just ask.    Look, me aren't queezy about sex. We're only worried that we might scare you.    Remember, this man has been taught since he was a little boy "Don't hit girls!!"    He's lived his whole life with this drilled into his head. Now, throwing you down, spreading your legs, and having his way with you....it's not hitting a girl, but it's pretty close.     So, you HAVE to let him know that this not only acceptable, but also welcomed. You have to encourage him to be more aggressive.     And be persistant about it. An old girlfriend of mine had to hit me over the head about it five or six times before it sank in. I was just too used to loving like Sir Galahad and the Princess Faire rather than the Dark Knight and Innocent Shepardess.     So...here is what you do:    1. Communicate it directly. Do it while sitting in his lap, arms around the neck, whispering in his ear. Just tell him that you fantasize about being "taken" rather than asked. Ask him to do this to you sometime this week when you're not expecting it (but anticipating it!)    2. Pick out a few movies to watch together where there is aggressive seduction on the part of the man ("Frankly my dear, I don't GIVE A DAMN!!"). Comment on how hot that is and how fluttery it makes you.    3. In order to keep this up, he needs to feel MANLY. If he works a desk job and doesn't move around enough, he's not going to feel MANLY. And MANLY men, make MANLY sex!!    So, encourage him to get outside. Compliment his masculinity. Ask him to open stubborn pickel jars or lift heavy boxes. Take note with keen interest at his muscles (even if they used to be bigger). Tell him how strong he is. Tell him it's a big turn on (true, no?)    You'll start seeing him acting more masculine, building his body back up, and becoming more aggressive (in a good way).     That is how you sustain this need without a thousand reminders.    But that is the long term solution. For the short term, you've just got to make this request and keep it fresh in his head.     And remember, it won't happen all at once....he might even get a little too rough initally (we forget how strong we can be). Just work with him and be encouraging.    I hope, when I marry, I marry a woman who is as interested in keeping things hot in the bedroom and is as supportive as you are.    Good Luck!|`|J2Rf0xQBaa	Ask him why he doesn't initiate stuff.  Then, you can work on how to direct him the way you'd like to go.  He might like that you start things, you never know.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Do to him the way you want him to do to you.    Afterward, ask him if he likes it.  If he likes it, then suggest that you are curious on how it feels and that he does the same thing to you next time....kinda like reverse role play.    If he likes it, he may just keep doing it from then on.|`|pErRGYH7aa	Why don't you hire a telepath to put the idea into his brain... Geez... expecting him to read your mind is really asking way too much.  If you can't just come out and ask for what you want with your husband, you're a very poor communicator and are bound to have serious issues because of it at some point in your marriage.
H3WHxCgaaa	Nope - don't do it...when you are married you become responsible for each other - legally (amongst other ways...).  Meaning - her bad credit - your bad credit - anything you both purchase during the marriage gets divided in court during divorce.  So let's say things don't end well but your "agreement" was that you split your items up according to who purchased them, but she's mad so she gets to court and says she wants half of everything...she'll get it...    My sister-in-law almost did this - thank goodness she had enough common sense to pass on it...|`|AA12180527	No matter how hot she is you have to figure out how long will it take for the papers to come through. Some take more than 5 years and you have to figure out in the mean time what are you going to do? Date other people, start to date her, it is too complicated and there is a chance where someone will get hurt or get caught.|`|z6O5ifdGaa	It's not that easy...    You will have to prove to immigration that you can financially support her and yourself and prove your income for the last 3 years would of been able to financially support both of you.     You'll have to be married for at least 3 years, and go through intense immigration interviews (both of you) plus have shared bank accounts and bills going to the same address. She'll also need an immigration attorney.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	It doesn't work that way any more. She wouldn't be a citizen for years after the marriage, and they'd probably find out about the fraud. Good luck in prison, bub.|`|4YZBPfhRaa	dont do it.      my friend moved here from britain and he married on of his friends here to get his papers and he is miserable now. seriously DONT do it. :/|`|JbA7a5kGaa	It what way are you friends?    Your young, so how do you know she isn't playing you.  You write that "shes very hot" like she is going to let you tap that azz.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Regardless of the legality - if you do this, they will check up on things.    So you`ll have to live together (which of course is a great sacrifice with a hot woman) etc.    The age difference is not really an issue - especially if she looks younger than she is.    But, be careful to act the part very well.  Hey, for all you know, you both would enjoy it and decide to stay together :)    My advice: be careful, and make sure that you do not make mistakes.
jpbychDAaa	If someone's being a b**** to you, stand up and get in their face about it. People can't hurt or control you without your consent. So the next time one of your friends says or does something mean, do something mean right back.  At the very least you'll be able to express your emotions...  Best of luck! |`|pQBjqMkoaa	idk be intresting if you want more friends
xhqKLSwCaa	Why would you even want to be friends with someone like that?  Find friends who treat and respect you well and treat them with the same respect.
AA10197672	Just straight out ASK her why. Thats rude that she is ignoring you. She clearly knows you want it, but she is not doing it. She is taking ur gifts and not wearing em. So what is she doing with em? Just hanging them in her closet? Ask for them back and see if they stil have the tags or they are worn. Interesting I have a feeling she is using you - pay for her things, and she is wearing it for someone else. She wants you for your money. If a girl is in love with her BF then she 'd for sure do anything for him, especially the lingerie. Sorry to say this but she does not seem to be in love with you. Id suggest you follow her around for some time and see what she does . I bet you will find her in someone else's arms...|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Why isn't she "good enough" all by herself? That is the question that I would be asking myself.|`|NGKwsawdaa	well if she doesn't want to then stop asking. when you continue to beg and ask then it gets annoying and your partner will not do as you request. Stop asking her so much and then she will do it on her own.|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	If you have "staight asked her to" and she still doesn't I am willing to bet that it is a good chance she never will.    Good luck with that one.     Maybe start dropping hints that you want to break up and if she asks why tell her you don't find her sexy enough. That she needs to wear more lingerie.     I do all kinds of things I don't want to beacuse my wife has asked me to.|`|IEVwBt24aa	dont push her you will **** up your relationship|`|3vbHZBioaa	Has she gain weight recently? If so she probably feels insecure about her own body..Compliment her every way you can and talk to her and ask why she doesn't like wearing lingerie anymore..find out the real problem I wouldn't keep asking her to do it..There is definitely an security issue she is dealing with..best of luck|`|fDT0YhROaa	maybe as a model she did some things she shouldn't have and now will be reminded of them...maybe because she is with you she doesn't want to think about it kwim?? meh, i dunno, just a suggestion lol
P1H02dqgaa	Hey Jessica!    This could be either very simple - or a really complex problem.    The simple problem could be that she has low self-esteem, feels very unsupported at home and, like you have said, she has feelings of envy or jealousy for you and similar friends.  Imagine if you had low self worth?  It would probably appear that everyone else was so much happier and so much more confident than you could ever be.  It wouldn't be true, but the way you feel about yourself impacts on how you view and feel about others.    Although the problem itself is relatively simple, the solution is a little more difficult.  You can be supportive and understanding about how she feels, remind her of all her great qualities and tell her that you value her as a friend.  Lower confidence, shyness etc. can be boosted with supportive friendship.  As she gains a little more self-esteem, the need to lie will lessen and she'll probably grow out of it.  Simply, it could be she needs to mature a little more yet, find her own feet as it were, so she doesn't require the lies as a 'security blanket' anymore.    The complex problem is - persistent lying (pathological lying), can be the result of an underlying more serious problem.  There are numerous mental health disorders that include this type of continual, and wholly unnecessary, lying.  These of course, can't be diagnosed or treated by yourself, and it would require a professional to help under such circumstances.    It's difficult to know whether her behaviour is the result of her age and confidence issues - or she's really struggling with something a little more serious.  The only way for you to even suspect what it might be, is to look at her other behaviours.  Is this the only odd thing that she does - or infact, are there plenty of other peculiar or 'not quite right' things that you've noticed?  Or is she, in every other way seemingly perfectly okay - it's just the lying?    Either way and for whatever reason, I think you should always call her on it.  When she lies, don't wait until later, question her then.  Tell her you know she's lying, you don't like it and wish her to stop in future.  Each and every time - don't let her get off.  It may seem a little cruel - but by not flagging it, you're 'enabling' the lie.  You can tell her that she's still your friend, and if there is something she'd like to talk to you about, or if  there is some other way you can support her - then you'll do it.  But that you will not tolerate the lies.    If your efforts go in vain, and you can't bear it no longer, then I think for your own benefit you should call time on the friendship.  Try to help first, but if it starts getting too much - time to leave.    Best of luck hon  Karen  xxx|`|q9BItD25aa	Well, she is living in a world that she wished she lived in. The poor thing. I can remember lying about things when I was younger....it was more of a " wishful thinking " type lie more than it was a real lie. Be kind to her.....?|`|6pUFu5qxaa	yes, i sorta have a friend like that, but demi lovato, selena gomez, and jonas brothers are all musicians from disney. There really aint nothing you can doo, but go along. soon enought it will end.|`|E7GwqMotaa	allot of ppl like them as a real mental problem or just low self esteem|`|uXbWtgnsaa	Well I see you listed some American Celebs, let me guess she's 12 or 13?  everyone is like that at that age.|`|oezTDqm5aa	It sounds like your friend is just very insecure about herself and her life, and lies to you to save herself a feeling of embarrassment. I wouldn't confront her head on about the issue. It sounds as if having stricter parents is causing her problems. Chances are in a short while her parents will loosen up when they feel she's old enough to go out by herself. Stick with it.|`|qGNkB2Ipaa	Damn she's a little liar!    Anyway, just evrerytime she tells you a lie just say,    "yeah , yeah, yeah "    in a sarcastic way      and     "yeah right "    and  if she says,    "No really"    just say    "C'mon stop lying"    Unless your friends is Miley Cyrus xP|`|eBT0KY4Faa	she probably wants to make her life more interesting than it actually is. you should tell her that you like her for the way she is and that its not her fault that her parents are strict.|`|wiufdlbUaa	I think the answer lies in the book "The Hundred Dresses".|`|5DybnUhBaa	i think i know the problem..  She might be jealous(like you said)or maybe she's have a problem at home.like she's in a fight with her parents which makes her really stressed out (maybe). I would just have a talk with her in person and    get things straight. But be nice and clam...|`|9Emn2buTaa	Like you said you answered your own question, She is Jealous!  The best way to get her to stop is to confront her if she says that she is going to spend the weekend with Demi or the Jonas brothers which you know are lies and just come out and say, "oh wow i wish i were friends with them well we have plans for next week and the week after that, you can come with us whenever."  If she has "plans" weekends afterwords then actually come out and say.  "Hey we have plans this weekend and I know your Parents are strict and all ,but you've been kept in your house so long maybe they will let you have a break and be more free."|`|ECvEknqtaa	i think that she is doing that because she cannot go with u guys she is trying to spend all the time she can with u guys at school but wants to make it really interesting. but i think that because she has been lying for some time, she is going a bit over the top. just try talking to her and tell her that u r her friend but tell her that u like her the way she is without all the lies. she wil be reasured when u tell her that u will stay friends with her but she just needs to stop lying. im sure itll work out. gd luck! :)|`|5gqb2uzFaa	tell her to get prof and bring a picture with them so you can believe her!!!
bO2rzfISaa	What's a planning process for marriage counseling? You call and make an appt. and you two need one.     Would your husband call this infidelity? If my husband were doing it, I would.    You and your ex broke up for a reason, even if the two of you are in denial about it now. Also, cheating is a terrible foundation to build a relationship on.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Yes you are giving something Personal to your ex that your not able to share with your husband, try harder.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	If he talks to his ex-wife and has nice emotional coversations, would you be upset?  I would be.  I bet he would be if he knew.  Since I am betting that he doesn't know about the conversations, I would have to say it is a form of infidelity.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	IMO yes, it is an emotional affair.  Much more typical for women.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You're heading that way, yes.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Yes it is, but you knew that already or you wouldn't have asked.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Here's the litmus test: ask your husband.  Seriously.  If you won't ask him, the only explanation is because you know you're doing wrong.  If you do ask him, let him decide whether or not he feels comfortable with it.  Maybe he'd be OK with it if giving you the go ahead would get you off his back.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Emotional infidelity is sometimes worse than physical.  Careful where you are stepping because you are on a fine line.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	It's not technically infidelity, but your husband might be hurt if he knew you were having them. However, if you are in a failing marriage, and he refuses to put any work into it in order to save it, perhaps, this is a signal to you that it is time to end your marriage.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Some people consider it "emotional infidelity." You are getting things that your husband should be giving you from another man.  These situations can easily get out of hand when you become more emotionally involved with your ex instead of working on your marriage with your husband.  I don't find anything wrong with having male friends, but if you're hiding it from your hubby, then you know you're doing something wrong.  If you want to continue, then I suggest you have a conversation with your husband letting him know that you have this friendship.  Then nobody can accuse you of something that you're not doing.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	it is if you are seeking in him what lack in your marriage..you say you have intimacy problems..then whats going to be next with your ex...i doubt it will be just conversations...    if you are not happy, being with your ex is not the solution..it might seem like a temporary relieve..but in the long run it would just make things more complicated...    fix your problems with your husband, if thing dont work out, then you have to end it, and have to find your own happiness..a man is not the answer..once you figure out what you want in life, you can think about if you want to get back with your ex or keep those conversations...    dont get things mixed up, just do one thing at the time and you'll be fine    good luck|`|1L1AxWoXaa	You are having what is called an emotional affair. Sorry dear but you should not be seeking anything out from another man that you are missing from your husband. Maybe it is time that you start making some difficult choices. I understand how frustrating it can be to have a husband that is unwilling to put effort into your relationship. I was married to a man like that. I did end up leaving him and I am currently very happily married to a man that will do anything for me and vise versa.|`|egpVC6uMaa	Yes...how would you feel if your husband found his ex and started having these "best" conversations that he can't seem to have with you, about everything he wanted but didn't get from marrying you...and how, miraculously, she has all these qualities that he wants?    Would you consider that ok?|`|kBM0HEj6aa	I had the same problem; ok for about a year then he reverted to form.  Meaning that's how he was that way before he met me.  Some men change for the short term for the woman they're with but can't maintain it.  If he won't consider counseling or try hard to be with you, like you try with planning weekends and such, you might have a very serious problem, beyond wondering if you're emotionally cheating on him.  It's easy to talk to someone you know cares about you; most of us talk to our girlfriends!  PS I'm getting divorced now (after 10 years - shouldn't have waited that long, 2 kids boy 9 and girl 7); he never became emotionally available to me, besides not holding a job with benefits for very long, but that's another story!|`|2ebd8c899f6ffcd59a224386f106fbcaaa	Not at all.  Your ex is someone you can trust and talk to.  He is a good friend.  If you are having problems with your spouse then you should seek counseling.  And if he keeps refusing... then maybe it wasn't meant to be.|`|0WstfAmzaa	In my opinion, that is called an emotional affair.  Ask yourself this question, if you found out your husband was talking to an ex- having productive, meaningful conversation that resulted in him feeling all the affection and attentitveness he should be getting from you - how would you feel about that?
W0KQTXrvaa	now that's a wacky marriage|`|7foornMVaa	Stupid is as Stupid does.............|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	See a lawyer, you may be able to get an annulment.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	File for an annulment|`|NGKwsawdaa	let me guess that you made the mistake of marrying him for papers???|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Get a lawyer in your current home state. File for divorce or annulment. Your lawyer can tell you which one you qualify for in your state.|`|XBISuNYKaa	find him and kill him|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You are going to have to file for a divorce involving a missing spouse if you dont know where he is currently. Youll then post a ad in your local newspaper stating the lawsuit and against whom for about 30 days and after that the divorce goes on without him if he doesnt reply in the meantime. You will be awarded everything you request and he can never contest it ever again. The only problem is if you got say, spousal support, youd never collect it without knowing where he is. But you can obtain a divorce without him. Good luck
CEKAqtB1aa	Don't get involved it may back fire on you and you will look like the bad guy for 'meddling' even if your intentions were harmless.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	This actually depends on what country you're in, because the real problem isn't him failing to inform her of his house's foreclosure (and no, not telling her is not the same thing as lying about it), it's whether the foreclosure could have any effect on her credit rating and ability to keep her own house.    Unless you are a lawyer and you know that this could cause actual harm to her or her credit rating, you really have no business intruding in their personal matters.     And consider: she may know it's under foreclosure but might have been hoping that if you rented it, he would have enough money to pay the arrears.|`|YMzRBzZAaa	don't say a thing unless she comes up and asks you.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	That's a tricky one. You might not want to get in the middle of that. On the other hand, wouldn't you want someone to tell you? But if you do tell it might end your friendship. I would go to my friend and say that you are having trouble keeping your mouth shut as you feel that you are deceiving his girlfriend as well by not telling her about the foreclosure. Say you think he should tell her what is happening as she will find out eventually anyway, he cannot expect to keep this a secret forever. If he refuses to tell her, tell her yourself if you feel it is your place.
w4dmRE3Waa	explain everything like you and nick should explain/ignore the rumor thing, and stop dating in secret it sound like not only is you best friend jealous but also the ex girlfriend. explain to your best friend the situation and if she is your friend she will understand. plus it doesnt matter if you are liked or hated by the school as long if you have a few friends backing you up the rest wont matter|`|H2Ub2YhMaa	move to a different school|`|BRg8RNPjaa	Transfer to another school or just ignore all the immature little kids.

764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Not all women are bothered by it. I'm not. I don't take my husband masturbating to porn as him having no desire in me. My husband doesn't affect my self esteem because I had it before I was married to him. He didn't bring it to me by coming into my life. I'll admit that when I was pregnant, my self esteem was at an all time low but that had nothing to do with me not feeling like my husband found me desirable. It was because I felt undesirable and nothing he would tell me made me feel different. So, no I don't take it personally. I don't feel like I'm being cheated on, either. For one thing, it's not exactly the porn that he's masturbating to because he can just as easily maturbate in the bathroom in the dark. I know that watching porn is an assistant for something he's going to do anyway.     Not only that but I'm sexually aware enough to know that, it's much easier and quicker to masturbate, than it is to have to turn the other person on, wait for them to get in the mood, and then have to have sex. By the time you get there, it's possible to lose the erection, and it leaves you frustrated. My husband didn't have to tell me this. I knew this long before getting married. Your husband hid it from you because he didn't want to upset you but wasn't ready to give up something that he saw as no big deal. That's what usually happens when a person gives up something for someone else but don't actually share your feelings behind it.     Lastly, you said you talked to him about wanting to have more sex but then you stepped back and waited for him to come on to you. I can guarantee you that if a man has to always iniate, he's gonna get sick of that and opt to not do it. Rather than wait for him to come on to you and then complaining when he doesn't, come on to him first and see where that gets you. The fact is, in all fairness, if you're only waiting for him to make the first move and you make none, you have no reason to complain. Well, you still have a reason but not a valid one.|`|BlVudiyfaa	well, it's not good    sort of like smoking    or binge drinking    Do this: Ask him how he'd like to be touched. You'll need to really get into it. I'd suggest you watch some movie(s) by yourself as instruction.     Men like to tug themselves because they can get to a higher level of climax. It's usually easier to bring it to the brink and then stop right there. Then, they can start again and bring it to te brink again. Finally, bingo.    So, make yourself try it.  Let him learn to trust you.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	No I have blocks on my computer, It leads to addiction, marital breakdown, and an unhealthy attitude towards women. I`m sorry men, you can`t convince me that pornography is healthy.Most porn videos show men being forceful with women, in unhealthy ways..        AND it s all the porn addicts giving the thumbs down    And all the STDs those pornstars acquire through their behaviours.Not to mention the young boys who get a hold of this stuff.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Porn is passive cheating if it's not mutual. I had a man who thought he was God's lover gift. All his so called prowess was simply reenacting what he had seen on dirty channels. He was a lousy lover, rough, selfish and abusive-and he either ejaculated in 10 seconds or couldn't get it up.  My husband of 22 years made a choice not to use porn before we even met. The sex is so much better-its about us, not other people.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I'm not insecure about my body or my sexuality. I do not consider it acceptable for my husband to have porn. I don't intend to share him with the, "Women of Porn." He should come to me for his sexual needs. We have sex every day, and I would like more if he were up to it, so he shouldn't waste his sexuality on porn.    Your husband isn't single anymore. Doesn't he see the difference?    Look at this website and see if it sounds familiar:    http://pornaddicthubby.com/|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He has it, and it doesn't bother me. I am secure in his love and desire for me, and I know that guys just like to look.  As long as I get a little when I want to, who cares?    And I think nearly all guys have it or look at it, the women who deny it just don't know where the stash is, LOL!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	All men masturbate and most of them use porn to some degree to do that.  It has nothing to do with how they feel about the women in their lives.  If you object to porn on moral grounds because of what goes into producing it, I would understand that, but looking at porn certainly does not mean he is unhappy with you.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You sure did go about that problem backwards!  Instead of focusing on the porn, you should instead be focusing on him showing interest in you, because the one doesn't have to have anything to do with the other.  I like porn, but I show as much sexual interest in my wife as she wants.  So, there's no reason for her even to think about my porn.  What you should do is shut up about the porn, and start assertively demanding the quantity of sexual intimacy you want.|`|OBCvewW2aa	No, it's not normal.  There's nothing normal about watching barely legal, drugged up rape victims faking sexual arousal.    Also, see studies involving correlations between porn viewing and sex crimes.|`|AA12050428	I don't blame you for feeling as yu do. Sorry but to me he sounds a bit of a perv.  Look around for someone who wants YOU.|`|B1sT1t44aa	Porn is not about being insecure it's about your husband disrespecting you and him having an addiction to it. Every man handles porn differently because some know where the fantasy ends and begins with it. If it was not a big deal to your husband to get rid of it he would not be hiding it from you and indulging in it behind your back knowing how it makes you feel. His habit is taking away from the personal intimacy in your lives and that is a problem. I would tell him that I don't care if he wants to view porn but that you prefer not to be with a man that does it.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	How is anyone supposed to live up to a 20ish blonde bombshell nympho who always looks like a 10? Of course it makes women feel like crap.|`|uuMCGT9taa	my bf has watched it doesnt watch it now and doesnt look threw magazines i always tell him i dont care if he does but he says why pay for it or just look at it when he has a girl    but i personally wouldnt get mad if i caught him watching porn     its one thing my ex use to do that really pissed me off he would rent a room and watch porn while we where having sex and be looking at the tv and getting off.|`|3vbHZBioaa	Porn is very addictive..he is being honest there is no pressure for him he doesn't have to please anyone but himself..So throw in a porn when you guys are together watch it with him..suggest things that make you feel good let him watch you masturbate.

NOT A GOOD THING|`|lOSSXKWIaa	OMG this sounds so familiar.  I am going through this very same thing right now.  In fact last night he ask me to sleep with the kids so he could watch porn (that he stopped by and got after work).   So I am with you.  Yes it hurts and no I don't think this is normal.  I think I have got to go and get some help with this.  We have a GREAT sex life.  So I ask myself why does he need/want this???  Now I am having a very hard time with this and so I don't care if we ever have sex again or not.  good luck!!!!  We both need it.  Sounds like!!!  keep me posted what becomes of this.  Thanks!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	It's not a big deal in our house...it's kept discreet, it's not something that causes interference in our marriage and I've never been shy about the human body...    That said, my husband never chooses porn over me and if he did I know I would feel differently about it.|`|0WstfAmzaa	What people don't understand is that you have the right to feel however you want about anything.  No one can argue with you and tell you that you shouldn't be offended or hurt.  If you are offended and/or hurt, then that's your perogative.  No one should tell you how to feel.    And, I completely agree with you.  I would be offended AND hurt.  A husband should have consideration for his wife's feelings on a matter.  If something bothers her that much, he should do his best to resolve the matter - not hide it from her and lie to her about it.  And when it affects intimacy with each other, then it's a problem.      So, yes, I think your feelings are normal and not unjustified.|`|3ywVS2JEaa	yeah i don't understand ppl with addictions like this,,my husband for one,,i don't get it,,i don't think it's normal if it's affecting those around him,,which it is,,|`|yAZq4SLaaa	It all depends on the person I guess.. My husband and I OCCASSIONALLY watch it, but we do so TOGETHER. Neither of us just sit and watch it without the other present, and we usually dont finish it.. But we do not dis-regard the other over it either.. We are very attentive to each other, and a movie NEVER comes first. I wish you the best.|`|2t62ETgEaa	It's selfish of him , when you have a partner who cares about your sex life..And notices that it is diminishing.He may have always done it when he was single.butttttt.he's not single now.And if he just likes to masturbate, then why can't he save it for the two of you to do together in your bedroom?It can spice things up alittle..But Truly it sounds like he is got addiction issues.Selfish excuse by your last comment.Part of pleasure should be pleasing the partner..Yep he's got a problem.Why don't you go get you a box of playgirl mags and some toys? see how he likes it.|`|egpVC6uMaa	I personally don't have a problem with my husband watching porn but that could be because there has never been an instance where I felt like I had to compete.    Every once in a while, I also enjoy watching it on my own or with him...it's not something he does often and it's not something he has to hid, in other to do...he just happen to watch it every now and then when I am not in the house. It doesn't take away from the time we spend together and it has never been an issue for me so I guess that might be why it never bothered me.    I would feel differently if I felt as if I had to compete with the porn and it made me feel insecure or like I was being replaced by porn...then there will also be a ban of porn, in my home.|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	porn is awesome. i dont care if my guy looks at it. but if he was doing it more than screwing me... id have cause for concern. he obviously thinks you are too hard to please in bed (but later admitted it's "easier" to use porn than deal trying to please me) you could try to have sex while watching porn.. might make it more enjoyable and less stressful for him|`|58294e53912fb415006cfdbe989d263aaa	I don't have a problem with my hubby looking at porn.I bought  him his subscription to playboy.And I don't care if he watches a porn flick.He is an intelligent rational man whom knows the difference between reality and fantasy.

5LT6LRUZaa	well you said it...you hit a dry spell you're going to have to work yourselves back up to where you were before...time to spice things up sweetie!    you have to entice him to give you foreplay and prolong that foreplay for as long as possible...you have got to both work at preventing him from ejaculating as long as possible...keep working at it (that's the fun part!) pretty soon it will take him longer to be done and your needs will get fulfilled as well!     teasing and pleasing is what you need and what will help prolong his time, when your needs have been met then give him his, before you know it you both will be on the same page and in sync with each others bodies again|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Err... talk to him?|`|inuecfP7aa	If you had natural child birth and he watched he maybe a little grossed out to go down.

And trust me once you have a baby it does change the feeling down there for a man, not saying he can't get used to it but there is a definite change and all the exercise in the world won't make it like it was before but it shouldn't make any difference you had his child.|`|mfqfO0wUaa	Give him oral first or better yet 69.
oUDDsVu5aa	well first of all if you are having these feelings and enjoy the attention your getting and don't have the same feeling towards your babies daddy then that should tell you something about yours and his relationship and where you stand in it so the best thing I can suggest is to end your relationship with him first and wait for a while to see if this is what you really want and if it is over then it is over as for the new guy don't do anything with him yet until you have handled the business at hand because you have to remember he is still your babies father and he is in your life as long as he is that babies father that is a long term thing so make it easy on your self.  as for you feeling guilty about flirting well you are starting to crave attention from someone other than him that is a bad sign that you are starting to disconnect your self from him most likely you only gave him another chance because your feeling sorry for him not in love with him pity isn't love so be true to your self and be true to your word don't feel guilty for what happen but don't let it go any further either just tell the other guy you like him if you really do that you have to respect you baby and yourself by ending this the right way before starting something with him if he is a Truly good guy he will agree and handle your business and move on because it sounds like you have already done that in your mind you just have to follow up with the rest of you.  just keep in mind your becoming lonely even though he is still there with you so end it with him on a good, honest term so that he can't blame you for his mistakes  best of luck hope this helps|`|LYVDtbFZaa	No because your not with your baby's dad anymore and you shouldn't feel guilty just because he still lives with you
BC2CNH3jaa	Your damned if you do, and damned if you don't, right? Let me also guess that he controls his behavior around other people. He acts like this just with you. It's not a mental illness. It's control and emotional abuse. I've been there. He will not change. Read the link, think about it. You don't have to live with this.|`|as2c3qCIaa	I am so sorry for you and your child.  I went through this exact thing with my husband.  I begged and pleaded with him to try and get some help.  I offered to go with him, I went by myself to try and encourage him.  Bottom line is you can not force someone to see these things about themselves.  I ended up leaving my husband.  We had an eight week old daughter together and I just couldn't do it anymore and the thought of bringing my babe up in a house that was so unhappy gave me the courage to leave.  After we broke up he finally had a complete breakdown.  He says now that he can see what he was doing to us, but that he had no idea at the time.  He said that the only thing that he thinks that would have gotten through to him was nothing short of a complete family intervention.  Good luck to you and your babe.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	it definately sounds like something is wrong.  see if he will go to counseling.  things wont get better unless he gets help.|`|AA12180527	may be you should talk about him seeing a counselor or go see a doctor. you do not want it to affect your marriage too much and it already sounds like it is getting you stressed out!!|`|AA10787865	Yes, there is something wrong with him and no, you can't convince him if he can't see it himself.  If he's treating you like this, he will eventually talk to your daughter in this same way.   My husband grew up with a father like this and it was a very abusive relationship, mainly because he was the only one trying to convince everyone else that his father had a mental problem. His mother stayed married to him, but she's more of a shell of a person and my husband has no real relationship with his father. Keep going to the counselor but think about yourself and your daughter and what kind of environment you want her to be raised in.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	Sounds like he's a bit on the narcissistic side.  Those with personality disorders do not change and are not convincable.|`|TqpFbhJwaa	it sounds like he has bipolar disorder|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Drag him to marriage counseling.  If he will not go, go alone.  It will help you get your head straight and figure out what to do.
vn2Lq7hIaa	When the love and respect you have for a partner, has been destroyed, it might not be restorative, even with counseling. You are to be commended for giving your marriage a sincere effort. Many women would not have extended themselves that far.    You must now concentrate on your own happiness, and let the past fall at the wayside. I think you have to separate to do this. It's not ideal but lodging with a friend or family will get you out of the house immediately.Getting on your own is an easier step from there.    Once you're on your own with a support system in place, you will be able to evaluate all your options, with a clear mind. Whether you stay separated, divorce, or reconcile are the major issues, with your happiness being the prime factor of your decision.     Take all the time you need, enjoy your time with hobbies, friends and family. I wouldn't initiate or accept calls from husband for any reason except legal issues, which should be done through the mail service.    One last suggestion is to stay celibate for at least a year. Sex has a way of clouding you mentally, while pleasing you physically. The first couple of months is the hardest.     PS. Masturbation worked well for me!     Good Luck with whatever you choose.    God Bless|`|BlVudiyfaa	Pack your car, make him a nice dinner, tell him you have to run out and get something. Leave him with the cleanup of the kitchen.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	You have nothing to feel guilty about.    He has treated you terribly and you deserve better then this bully.    Leave and dont look back.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	You gave him the chance, sounds like he blew it.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Just remember that this is your life, and you're wasting it by being unhappy. Don't you think you're worth more than that?|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Your feeling guilty because he's trained you to feel that way. He's a master manipulator using your sweetness to control and dominate you. Sometimes we have to do what we is right regardless of our feelings. Get rid of him. In time, with thought and reflection, you won't feel guilty-you will be proud of yourself.  You don't need his drama.|`|StxCHnTkaa	I'm married to a guy like this. I left him last summer and ended up going back again (I'm a major sucker myself). He won't change. Couselling only helps if they see the problem and are committed to change their behavior. Weigh your options and make a decision, the problem with that is that you need to stick to your guns and not give in. If you do leave, I would change your number and not have any contact with him in any way. That's the only way you'll keep from being pulled back in. In my case I was forced to talk to him and with the emotions and hormones (I had just had a baby), I caved. It's harder to leave than people think and if you have kids it's even more so....good luck to you!|`|IcnilUuUaa	He doesn't care that he is hurting you verbally, so you may have to leave. You deserve to be treated and talked to with respect, and if he still hasn't learned after counseling it may be time to make a break for it.|`|DT84bcetaa	No one deserves to receive verbal or physical abuse from a spouse. Those things are the recipe for a bad relationship. Even if it doesn't happen often and he says it won't happen again you should not allow yourself to be in harms way. Get out now!|`|7jA1FiY8aa	LEAVE HIM.  NOW.  RUN - do not walk away from this man.  This situation will NEVER get any better, it will only get worse.|`|bYjercAqaa	Run now, run far, run fast.    You gave him a chance and he screwed it up.     Leave now. Don't wait to tell him, just go.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	get out it wpii never change. he is going to get worse in time. i been there. why do you want to stay with someone who makes you un un happy and you are miserable? you have one life to live so live it happy and for you not him. there is someone out there who will treat you better. you deserve better then what you have.|`|pOCabUMvaa	You don't want to hurt him, honey he is so hurting you!!!    You are the victim, here, and he is the abuser, you are not a sucker for crying, you are in pain, you are hurt and you are plain tired of the vicious cycle he has you on.    Please, if you know of someone who can take you in, then go there, if you do not, then please, please go to a shelter, a women's shelter.    They have them where I live and they are wonderful, they shelter mothers and their children, and they give them a place to live and to stay, and they help the mother find a job and a place to call home, and they will not let your husband know where you are!!!!    There have been so many women where I live that have been at the shelter and have left the shelter, and who have strived and flourished on their own!!!!|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Are you still in love with him? It sounds like the counseling helped, maybe you should give it another go and this time just never stop going. They offer free marriage counseling at a lot of churches. if you really really want to leave, then do it and don't feel bad. Your reasons are justified.|`|f6YsGOynaa	After all he has hurt you, don't worry about hurting his feelings.  He hasn't given you the same consideration...why worry about it now.  He has no conscience and will say and do what he thinks will manipulate you into taking him back.  He feels out of control because you're not there to be his physical and emotional punching bag anymore.  Don't put that control back into his hands by allowing him to make you feel guilty.      Get out... abusers who aren't actively trying to get better will spiral downward until they hit rock bottom.  Some of them don't ever get there until they actually kill someone.  Don't let yourself become a statistic.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Why are you feeling guilty?  He's making you feel guilty to trap you into the relationship.  Take a step back and look at the situation.  He's only going to continue with his abuse and empty promises.  He will never change.|`|NGKwsawdaa	ok so stay with him just to make him feel better and let him treat you like sh*t, or start thinking about your feelings for a change and move on already. You do not allow any one to abuse you verbally or physically. You care more about him and his feelings than yourself. You come first unless you have kids. Do what is best for you|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	that cycle will never change. just leave him and don't look back.|`|HcwIDjMiaa	you shouldn't stay with someone you don't love. just leave him and start anew.|`|Gv71dW0oaa	Well stop being a sucker and actually stick to your decision. Your not hurting him because he is hurting you. You can;t stick with someone because you feel sorry for them, you won't get any where in life with that thinking process. Move on, you will be glad you did.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Stop being a sucker and ignore the guilt.  Of course you feel guilty.  You have probably been programmed your whole life to feel guilty.  Take positive steps to get as far away from him and people like him as you can.    Get some counseling.  You are as sick as he is..you need to realize that.|`|AA11401294	take self defense classes.|`|vqMah37Qaa	I know exactly how you are feeling.  I actually just posted a question similar to yours a few minutes ago.  My problem is I have told him and not only am I feeling guilty but I am also wondering if I am doing the right thing!  What my friends have been telling me to help me deal w/ the guilt is it is his actions that brought you to this decision.  Was he feeling guilty when he was verbally and physically abusing you?  Probably not....  I hope this helps a bit.  Just stay strong and e-mail me any time you need to!|`|K8rv2f2Iaa	LEAVE HIM  he is making your life miserable you dont want to die miserable?!   do you want to de from your husband beating you!!  leave and have a nice life!!|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	if u have done ur part, then u shouldnt feel guilty... leave him... whats most important is ur happyness not his, so start a new life... i really dont believe that u should deal with this s**t, so just leave him even if it hurts.. i  believe in a 2nd chance but it seems u already gave him more than 2... so leave...|`|yIxLi8r6aa	He won't learn how to love himself or others  if you stay letting him abuse you.  If counseling didn't work then he's not ready to change.  You have to make you happy. Best Wishes.|`|ZydKrH8Paa	When you broke up did you feel free?  Lighter?  Afraid, but not scared of the world?    When you got back together did you feel sick? Empty, alone?  Like something is missing?    Abuse only gets worse.  You've tried and it's ok to let it go.|`|7F2enSMDaa	First of all, based on your name, I'm assuming you are a mother. If so, is he the father? There's guilt right there - taking a child away from the father.    However, if you are not, then that's a whole other situation. If he's PHYSICALLY abusive, even a little...then you owe it to yourself to get out of that relationship before it escalates to something dangerous. Any abuse, even verbal, can be very harmful to you. You shouldn't have to deal with that situation.     Get help from a close friend or family member if you don't feel comfortable telling your husband his behavior is unacceptable. Make sure you stick to your ground and tell him you will not tolerate it.    And good luck...you can do it.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	If you don't think that talking about things will do anything, then end it.  (Maybe he doesn't realize he's slipped into his old ways.  If he's doing this on purpose, why do you feel guilty?)  Ask yourself, how is staying with him but wanting to leave good for him or you?  It seems to come down to hurting him or yourself.  If you've given him plenty of chances to help fix things, you shouldn't feel guilty.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	i was in the same situation witha man for 5 years...please DISTANCE URSELF from him ASAP....he will NOT change....its just a VIVIOUS CIRCLE!! why do u want to suffer all throughout ur life..,,no need to feel guilty!!! u have given him enuff chance and u too deserve to b happy!!! all d best...get out of this ASAP!!
G1f545lJaa	I would pick my friend(s).........really hard to get good friends, and you'll most likely find someone else.|`|T7SBu63Aaa	Sounds like middleschool...  You don't need a boyfriend in middleschool, just think of everyone as your friend. If you will lose your best friend by dating someone that will probably dump you after 2 months...not smart... So I say you should keep your bestfriend and maybe later in life you still might like him... and if he likes you then he will come to you.|`|w4dmRE3Waa	does your friend know you like him?? if she did she would respect that is she does remember it is mates(friends) before dates|`|5WzFKfW2aa	friends should always come before men no matter how they make you feel|`|3eIuXzrAaa	If your other "girlfriend" wont tolerate the fact that you go out with this guy, then is she really your friend?    Talk to this friend of yours and ask her why she thinks so badly of this guy (if what she thinks about him really matters that much to you). What she thinks shouldn't really matter much. If you love him, then you love him :D    I say goo for it and screw the girl ;P|`|YMzRBzZAaa	Well go on w/ yr life, but if they try and make you choose then tell the grl that she should choose between u and yr crush too|`|XeeYZedmaa	Friend all the way!|`|GF3rHIK7aa	When worst comes to worst you're girls come first.|`|vQ2Ffw6qaa	I know what you mean. My crush is my best friend's enemy too. But, since my best friend is really close to me, she respects my feelings even if the guy is her enemy. She doesn't think it's a big deal. Talk it out with your friend. She'll understand.
54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	If they are not happy together then make a fresh start, it's not like they haven't tried long enough to make it work.  Life is too short to be unhapy!|`|bZWbwyn4aa	It is still young enough to move on and make a happier life for yourself.  I'd consider it if I was that age too.  The last thing I'd want to do is stay in a marriage for the rest of my life because people considered I was too old to change my life.|`|LRV65TbHaa	course its not too late.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	well if they are not happy..whats the point my friends grandparents separated when they were in their 60s..because he cheated..so she left him and shes happy doesnt need him..    he is with this other woman and seems happy too..|`|YUtUsxLbaa	It doesn't matter how old a couple is.  If they both want divorce, they should divorce.  If anything, perhaps it should be more compelling to do it - why spend your last years on this earth in a miserable marriage?|`|AA11966578	that is not to late at all...I have seen 80 year olds get divorced.  Never to old to seperate an unhappy bond.|`|Q2MLikeUaa	of course it is not to late, in this day and age there is no earthly reason for anyone to stay in an unhappy relationship. Life is to short to be unhappy, even if you are older and have been in a relationship for a long time. You do not have to give up.
AA10661001	Probably not, especially if there is an English quiz associated with the decision.  Custody, not costody; their, not there, and too, not to.  Sheeesh.
QIwhMrBraa	not at all. i left my ex after 7 years. he was a classic abuser and will never change. i am one to cut my losses. i found a new partner who is not abusive and my son adores him, and i dont care im poor now because of it, money aint worth living like that.    what makes it impossible for you to let go? hope he will change? he won't.    www.womensaid.org.uk - lists all the signs of abusive behaviour. a real eye opener.|`|ddGzxxDHaa	ya had the same sit. you just cope|`|BlVudiyfaa	Yep, was verbally, emotionally and psychologically beat up by a domineering woman for 23 years. She even cheated on me in the end. What a piece of trash she was in the end.    I mistook her overbearing self as "strong" or "forthright" Cheese and crackers was I mistaken.    I thought that there was no life after, boy was I wrong! I've since remarried and have a beautiful woman, life and home.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	Yes, but realized I no longer liked who I was when I was with him.  It may be impossible to let go, but there comes a point where you don't really have a choice.  We all have our breaking points.  Hopefully more people knows theirs.|`|G2IoZpeqaa	I think we all have a breaking point as I did...I could not live in fear any longer...there is help out there for anyone who is suffering..they beat you down and your self esteem is low ...fight back to the cowards that inflict ..they are not the norm .usually drink induced..they are control freaks that cant fight a man ...and the same for women who abuse men too..its all about making them feel good|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Me.  And it was so humiliating because I always said that I would never allow myself to be treated that way.  And yet, there I was, just taking it and staying.    I finally got the guts to leave him and I'd never felt better.  Now I have a husband who treats me better than I ever imagined possible.  But I still haven't admitted to friends and family that I was stupid enough to stay for so long.|`|0v1kT2Zfaa	i know exactly what you mean i was in a relationhip like that for 8 years before i had the confidence to end it for good but in the end it wa the besst thing i ever did
z6O5ifdGaa	mine has cost me $4,000 so far and it's not over yet    it gets very difficult with children or if it's contested... with no kids and uncontested you can file papers yourself for a few hundred...|`|BlVudiyfaa	What do you hope to gain by doing this? Do you think he will simply go away? Do you think it will have zero affect on your children? What happens if your husband re-marries? Has more children? Ignores your children? Have you considered counseling? What have you do to repair the relationship?|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Yeah right $500!!  It's thousands of dollars.  It doesn't matter how poor you are, they don't care.  Why are you divorcing with 3 kids anyway?  Work it out.  For better or for worse, remember when you said that??|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	If you are in agreement of all matters, you don't even need a lawyer.  You can get a Pro Se divorce and do it yourselves.  But it only works if you agree on all custody, property, and visitation issues. You can get the packet at your local courthouse.    Ours cost about $300 4 years ago.|`|vvQBkzCtaa	honey you can go to your public library and get copies of divorce papers and fill them out yourself. then take them to the court house and i think you give them to the prsecutor,and he will present them to the judge and then they will set up a court datefor the divorce. you will have court cost ,but it will not be exspencive. good luck.|`|AA11960937	in pennsylvania its called no fault divorce where each party wants to just move on total cost 175 dollars some counties in pennsylvania even cheaper  been there and glad of it|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Look in the yellow pages for a paralegal service.  Most of them put together divorce papers and set-up your court date for you for around $350 to $500.  My divorce cost $475 in Arizona through a paralegal.
rn2chc2taa	well what does he like? if you have done somthing fun or funny together go and ask him if he remembers it.maybe he just dosnt know what to say around you
ndQkhqZeaa	She had no right to make a payment arrangement for you.      She can prove to the medical facility that you are required to pay 1/2. Once her 1/2 is paid its not her issue.    If you do not pay the facility in a timely fashion, its between you and them.
IXskJPlVaa	You did something very silly. Only thing you can do now is to be patient and allow things to cool down. Wait for sometime and try to explain it to him, may be things will work out. Best of luck.|`|G3Q21MDCaa	You can try your best to apologize to him and make it up to him.  Similar situation (but we weren't living together) happened to me and my gf of 8 months.  Just to give you an idea of what he might be thinking, here is what I told my ex gf.    I can't believe after all this time and what you have told me that you  think there is someone better than me out there for you, it hurts to know that you were even curious enough to go look.  I guess I'm your "Plan B".|`|qJzPQWDqaa	I think that if you went on a date you weren't happy in your relationship or you wouldn't have been curious about the other guy.|`|cGlVzud8aa	you cheated on him, you could try telling him your sorry to start, and give him time
XUrgcOMDaa	Seriously, just let it go.  She's a crappy person... but if you become a crappy person just to get at her... then it's a victory for her.      Just have faith that she'll get hers one day... you don't have to be the one to do it.  Besides, if your "sabotage" doesn't work out... you'll just end up vexed and feeling worse than you do now.    Can you think, in a movie or story, where the "hero" ever stoops down to the level of the villain?|`|9ccCHZHgaa	Nah, don't do that. You'll lose your dignity to it. Let her play her stupid little game alone, and tell the important people around you the truth about her - nothing more nothing less. You don't need to get back at her. She just can't act like a ***** without getting the consequences someday.|`|kWNLVQwWaa	You are obviously young and lack any foresight. Let a voice of experience tell you that "giving her a dose of her own medicine" is a horrible idea. In the end, making up rumors about this girl isn't going to make you feel better about yourself. It's just going to turn this whole situation into a bigger problem than you ever wanted. And anyway, these petty fights always blow over. I know that now it may not seem that way, and these things that girl is saying about you is going to follow you around your whole life, but it's not. Honestly, if you leave the issue alone and laugh it off, it'll all probably blow over by next week. It's your reaction that gives her power, by the way. If you act upset about all this stuff, you're giving her power in the situation. Shrug it off instead, and go about your life, and just remember there are many other nice girls out there who are willing to be your true friends!|`|A57LMS5Qaa	how close were you? spill some of her secrets. im in the same situation. i know you feel like a b*tch, i do to. but my friend deserved it.
5nni4JRyaa	I've been told I'm weird all the time. You should see it as a complement. I mean what is weird anyways? To me it just means you think outside of the box. Your your own person. You don't march to just any beat of the drum. You think on your own etc.     I hope this helps. And he probably did say it as a compliment.|`|bemTTV78aa	he is trying to get your attention by saying things that are supposed to bug you. he woulnt put your name on his status at all if he didnt like you even a little bit :]|`|ghQHUr4Oaa	Forget about what he said. It is perfectly ok to be weird. People are always gonna say crazy things about you especially in school. Just remember he is a immature little school boy with nothing better to do but to talk about somebody. Just continue to be yourself thats really all you can do. Until this guy is magically made perfect, I wouldn't give it a second thought.|`|XstaAKLLaa	don't feel humiliated..I think he's trying to get your attention, well if you're not interested in him, then ignore him and his comment...just try to forget about it.|`|9LqHgmcLaa	i think he was trying to get your attention to start a real conversation with you.|`|va4dh98baa	Don't panic.  Guys do this all the time and sometimes for very strange reasons.  If he continues to do this then it just means hes a jerk. Sometimes though they just need a way to get your attention to let you know that they could have feelings for you.|`|U9BLXFwaaa	Okay, Okay. (:  There's noo need to be in humiliation nation (;  Okay, So 1. You don't even hardly know the guy!  And 2. JUst cause on guy said that, the whole school isnt going to either!    I mean if you knew how many times a day i get called weird.. aha.  Im "punk" or alternitive"  At times too.  Soo don't frett.  He clearly is tooo stupid to know what to do.  So this was probably the only way.. [for him]  to gett you talking to him.  Either as a friend or something moreee(:    Sooo DO NOT DO NOT worry.  Just laugh, and say ik.  Because if it turns out he does like you and you dont like him then he'll stop bugging you if you agree with him.    It's no fun for guys, when girls don't react to what they do!    Haveee funn, and keep on smilin'' (:
jwftwLBTaa	Let them know your friendship is very important to you, and that they hurt you and let them know how you feel. Tell them you are sorry that this is coming between your friendship and you want to call a "truce"|`|cu8fUJbMaa	You can't approach it like that.  If you feel you owe someone an apology, then you should apologize. You can't put conditions on it or feel that if you apologize, they have to, also. We have no control over what others do. We control only our own actions. You know in your heart whether you owe an apology. If you do, then give it and do so unconditionally. You may want and even deserve an apology back, but that action is under the other party's control.  If you don't get one, then at least you know you did the right thing by offering your own apology and you can be comfortable with that.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If that person would not apologize to me for what he or she has done to me, then I may have to consider end my friendship with them.|`|4e7396814e6ad0f7293c08e793cf2a20aa	write down what you want to say in this apology and let this person know that what they did also hurt you but you want to try and save your friendship. if there is no response then this person is truly selfish and you dont need a friend like that.

lgMTSoAtaa	If you don't want to lose your husband, then just make sure he doesn't find out and everything should be fine. Also, I suggest you pick the appropriate hotel rooms and make all necessary arrangements, just to make sure your secret beau hasn't set the place up with any hidden cams in advance which is what happened to me once with a guy I met offline.|`|3vbHZBioaa	So why would you want to have an affair? have a 3 some sooo much more fun...best of luck|`|AA11401294	follow your genitals!|`|fDT0YhROaa	that you would even ask with no reason...you'll do it anyway    but my answer is no...and if u do may your burn with disease...affairs are filthy|`|l85gvsEmaa	If you want to, go for it.

d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	WOW!!!   I think you have a keeper here dude.  The first step in maturity is when someone wishes to hold because they want to mature more.  She is aware of how young she is right now and being that young, people do really start to mature more so than they already are by the next few years.  Wait the four years or so, maybe in two years propose to her and while you wait for the next 2 years, plan the wedding for that 4 year mark.  This is ample time for you to really see her, get to know her more and really talk about things together.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	It's going to be hard to do and it being long distance wont help (your going to spend a LOT of time on the phone lol), but it shows that she is really mature that she wants to grow up a little bit before she marries you. good luck!!!|`|AA11960937	both you and her go your own separate ways and after 4 years call each other to see if you feel the  same about each other i would totally doubt it she is smart to wait if your love is true it will work out if not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all  face facts its not going to work to much time and to much distance for it to work|`|1L1AxWoXaa	Well since it is a long distance relationship it makes your situation a little stickier. Have you considered relocating to her area? 4 years is really not that long if you are near the person you love. It sounds to me like your girl has a good head on her shoulders. She is right, 19 is just too young to get married. You can step up your relationship with out actually taking the plunge. Look for a job in her city and see if relocating would be an option.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	I had a friend who was engaged for 6 years and waited till she was done with school to get married, her fiance had to move to another country to finish his school.  They talked on the internet, they got webcams and once in awhile one of them would fly out to see the other.  If you really want this you do what you can with today's technology to keep in touch until you can get married.
AA12198711	How to contest a will  On what grounds can I challenge a will?    If you believe that you have not received a sufficient benefit under a will and you fit certain criteria, you may be able to challenge the will.    There are several different ways in which you may be able to do this:        * If you are a close relative and you feel you have not been provided for as you should, you can challenge the will under the FAMILY PROTECTION ACT 1955.      * Whether or not you are a relative, if the deceased promised to include you in the will in return for services that you provided, you may be able to challenge the will under the LAW REFORM (TESTAMENTARY PROMISES) ACT 1949.      * If you are the deceased's husband or wife, or their civil union or de facto partner, you are entitled to have the property of the relationship divided under the equal-sharing rules of the PROPERTY (RELATIONSHIPS) ACT 1976, instead of taking under the will.      * There may be grounds for challenging the legal validity of the will (for example, if it was not properly witnessed).    The immediate effect when you notify the court that you intend to challenge a will is that the executor or trustee under the will (that is, whoever is responsible for distributing the deceased persons estate to the beneficiaries) must not make any distributions from the estate, apart from debts, expenses and funeral costs.  Challenges under the Family Protection Act    Under the FAMILY PROTECTION ACT 1955 you may apply to the Family Court or High Court to be provided for out of the deceaseds estate if you are the deceaseds:        * husband or wife, or civil union or de facto partner (but see below the restrictions applying to de facto partners)      * child      * grandchild      * dependant step-child      * parent, if you were dependent on the deceased or if no spouse, partner or child of the deceased is living when you apply to the Court    The court will uphold your claim if it believes that the deceased failed to fulfil his or her moral duty to provide adequately for the maintenance and support of family members.    In making its decision the court will balance this moral duty against the principle that a testator should be able to decide what is to happen to his or her property.    Since 1 February 2002, a de facto partner (including a same-sex partner) who was living with the deceased when he or she died has had the right to apply under the Family Protection Act. However, if the relationship was for less than three years, the court cannot make an order in favour of the de facto partner unless the court is satisfied that        * either -            o there is a child of the de facto relationship, or            o the de facto partner made a substantial contribution to the relationship, and      * not making the order would create serious injustice to the de facto partner    Those restrictions applying to de facto partners do not also apply to civil union partners.  Challenges under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act    Even if you are not a close relative, you may be able to bring a claim under the LAW REFORM (TESTAMENTARY PROMISES) ACT 1949. This covers situations where you have worked for or given some other service to the deceased, who in return promised to leave you something under the will.    You will need to provide satisfactory proof of the promise, and this can sometimes be difficult. Evidence can be oral or written  for example, letters.    To justify a claim it is not necessary for the promise to have been made before you provided the work or services.  Division of property under the Property (Relationships) Act    Under the PROPERTY (RELATIONSHIPS) ACT 1976, the legal spouse or civil union or de facto partner (including a same-sex partner) of a deceased person has the right to choose between either -        * applying under that Act for the property of the relationship to be divided according to the Act's equal-sharing rules, or      * not having the property divided under the Act and instead receiving the property that is given to the surviving spouse or partner under the will.    For the division of property, see How to: The division of property when a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship ends.    Applying under the Act does not prevent the spouse or partner from also applying under the Family Protection Act or the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act (see above). But presumably if property is divided under the Property (Relationships) Act, this will be relevant to any family protection claim.  Challenging the legal validity of the will    You may challenge the legal validity of the will if there is proof that:        * the deceased person (the "testator") was not of sound mind (that is, was mentally incapacitated) when he or she signed the will, or      * the will was not properly signed and witnessed, or      * the testator did not know and approve of the wills contents when he or she signed it, or      * the testat
d4f7a89688a581eea0b65f858f25f2daaa	I like the cute card idea - the letter could be too much -- I would not tell him you are "into him". just that you enjoy his company and appreciate him being there for you...      That is enough to get him to respond to your card ---        Listen to your instints - if you kind of think its creepy - it might be...|`|JqD8in5Naa	He will read it once. see if there's any money in the card and then throw it out|`|XAw4cJmjaa	I don't think it's corny or creepy.

RcTfS7rsaa	no i dont find that strange at all, he's probably just going threw alot and dosent have someone to talk to. he's probably at work most of the day anyways, and dosent have anybody to talk to that stuff about. so he chose you, if you have a problem with it or feel kinda strange, you should let him know right away. but to me, it seems like he's just seeking friendship or advice. and since your married, he probably thinks you must know it all. (:    hope that helps girl |`|wou0AgXDaa	Well if your married and he knows it , i wouldn't worry too much , maybe he just needs someone to talk to , or he needs advice about dating and that's why he brings it up , maybe since he knows your married he wants your advice on how he can find a girl ..... it is a little weird but i wouldn't worry too much :]   hope this helped

Just keep trying to talk to her and she will open up to you.  That has been my experience anyways.

First take a pregnancy test... No first pray and ask for forgiveness and promise never to do it again, then take the test.  Then re-evaluate your choices in life so far, make the next choice, then do the opposite because obviously (unprotected sex,a married man, 4 kids) your instincts aren't point on.    The baby does deserve life.    If the married man didn't want anymore kids he would have worn protection... or better yet, not cheated on his wife.   Don't let him make a decision for YOUR life.  Good luck

I know it's hard going back into interviews and work after being away for so long.. I've done it myself.... but you'll be fine once you get out there.    Anyway, I just mentioned the adult night courses only because they're usually a lot shorter and quicker than taking the whole thing over again and putting in all that time again since you've already done it.  You just need a little confidence to get you back out to there again.  You have a great background behind you already.  Good luck to you!!

rpJu5XfUaa	I had a similar problem and believe me there is nothing wrong with you! I was 16 before i really started likeing any boys, i thought i was a freak because i had never had a boyfriend and had never been interested in anyone. Then i discovered that all the boys my age were just too immature for me because i am very mature for my age so that is why they didn't appeal to me so maybe it is the fame for you. That is when i started meeting lads that were a bit older like 17/18/19 and they were so much more mature and i found them so attractive.

You didn't have a mother figure so you need the mother figure in your life for a while before you can like the guys. Thats a shame. You have a gap in your life and it is causing you to fall behind in relationships.     It is normal for girls in your situations. Just as it is with guys that have no father figure. There needs to be a love towards the mother and without that you won't be able to develop relationships.    Good luck though!|`|QvhPJAKyaa	sorr but it does sound like our a lesbian.  how can ou not be if our not attracted to bos?  sorr but...|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Maybe you are gay.

ANYWAY lol, that was just cutesy stuff. When i got near 13 i was really freaked out because i didn't know if i liked boys or girls, it was confusing because, i wasn't attracted to girls, i just didn't know how to look at girls and boys. And i was worried cause if iw as lesbian then people wouldn't accept me. Then i forgot it and i happen to be straight. A few months after being 13, i got a major crush on orlando bloom!:P LOL  And just recently on a boy in my class. I'm nearly 15, in June.  Don't Worry, you'll figure it out in the end, concentrate on school, cause trust me, it's really distracting when you like someone, for me atleast anyways.  O.o    It's different for everyone, trust me.  The thing is, i started feeling a bit left out, well not left out but i do want to be in relationships now, i do wanna grow up.

I think that you are normal, even if you do turn out to be attracted to women you are still normal! I did not really like guys that much when I was your age, I only liked them because my friends liked them, then eventually I met one that I really really liked and was attracted to. Sometimes women get the "girl crush". and all girls get them its just a very strong friendship that sometimes may be confused with sexual feelings. Do not worry.

Your time will come.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	Dont worry now, it will all become clear as you grow older, just enjoy yourself|`|DSsJVQJIaa	me too. but i think its more because i'm not interested in having a relationship. i love being single. i have been interested in guys, but i've never wanted to have a relationship with them. you're normal.     i'm 16 and i've never really had that attraction either. i think its cuz i'm waiting for my perfect prince :D|`|4tynRVpzaa	Sounds like you munch carpet.|`|cfnuDybfaa	well you might just be gay or confused, about weather you like girls or not. but if you have no intrest in boys then you might just be bicurious. that means your curious about weather you like girls and you still like boys at the same time.|`|nKi8zxOYaa	I am NOT gay and I didn't start being attracted to boys until I was about 17 or 18.  Didn't care anything about them!|`|eh7O4b4Paa	theres nothing wrong with being a lesiban.|`|x9vI6z4Yaa	I was kind of the same way.    But that was before I met my boyfriend.  I'm pretty picky though, when it comes to guys... it took a long time before I actually found one that was everything I ever asked for.  You just have to be patient! :)|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Yes, you're normal. You're not a lesbian, please don't go there. You're only fifteen years old! You shouldn't even really be dating until you're seventeen because your immaturity level would be a little better by then. You're not gay, you just really like your teacher [not in that way]. Don't confuse it with homosexuality. Relax, the guy that will make your heart beat fast will show up soon.|`|RvFx6k4Gaa	its hard to say right now, i really do think it sounds like you might prefer women, which is fine, but i think that if you liked boys, you would know by now, i just dont really understand how you  can't know who your attracted to when your 15 years old|`|NY9rWFfNaa	maybe you just aren't at that stage yet or are in fact homosexual  what ever you are it doesnt matter because your an indervidgual|`|dTXyz67qaa	dont worry ur not the only one it doesnt matter if u fancy the same sex and yeh u r normal :) or mabey its because u havent found the right guy xx hope i could help u xx|`|VkyCQaeFaa	Don't worry, you're still young.  You just haven't met anyone that's caught your eye.  Give it time, there's no rush.  There's no rule that says you have to have a relationship by the time you're 15 or even 16/17/18 etc.  It'll happen when it happens.|`|zjY4qk7eaa	Hey, I have the same thing. I'm15 and have le same thing.|`|LWyRyQvKaa	I think you just haven't ran across someone that really catches your eye yet. don't worry you're only 15 give it time!|`|GZ05XsUMaa	If you want to be with the guys then try. If not then well, good luck.|`|YtjjhT1Haa	well, if that's the case then you're probably on the edge of turning lesbian.  which is totally ok!  your true friends won't mind at all and who cares it's the new generation.  be yourself and be proud of it.|`|yfsM7pVGaa	It's just because you are too much interested in studies......all these feelings will start in the course of time.Don't worry you are just another normal girl|`|YHbREkngaa	OK,    so this sounds reasonable to me. many girls start looking at really fit boys at this age but many don't.  the next couple of years are quite important. sex drive kicks in and you might find someone you like.    when i was 15 (25 now) i wasn't really interested in boys that much either. i went out with a couple of nice personality boys. who when we were older turned out to be gay. i think the thing with you teacher seems reasonable affection and affirmation in that way, especially if not received by your mom, Can be very powerful.     Just take it easy. theres no rush. in my opinion concentrate on forming good solid friendships with boys and girls- that way you'll feel more secure and confident about it when the time does come    Take care x x
JOQJwcR6aa	I got adopted --  yes i wanted to see my birth parents all the time...before getting adopted i would see my mom but she stopped coming so they stop scheduling visits for me and my sister to see her and they took her rights from her.....after a while i would see my dad but he didn't think we were his so i had to get a d.n.a. test and they found out that he was my dad and not my sisters but the older i got he stopped coming to so i didn't even see him anymore    Yes i do think if i was raised by my birth parents things would have been different because it's nothing like that love from the people that made you    I was taken from my mother when i was about 3 months old but didn't get adopted until about 13 years old...so i was jumping from foster home to foster home thank god i didn't ever have to go to a group home.    Yes i have 5 brothers and 6 sisters...so 11 siblings in which one stayed with me     Yes of course i wished i had been adopted by different people sometimes... the family wasn't so accepting and didn't like us because we weren't my adopted mothers real children...we were treated way different then the people that were in the family by some of the adults not all though...we were always reminded we weren't real family and that we didn't have one..only by some people in that family...some of the children in the family would tell our friends that our mother gave us up it was just to much and sometimes our adopted mother would do the same thing but only to our faces..if we got into trouble she would say if we were her real kids this wouldn't happen or once she told my sister that she was going to get her neice to beat her up...we would get in trouble for a lot of things stupid things like if our hair wasn't fixed we'd get into trouble by her and on punishment and that's only one of many things    it's a lot harder growing up in someone elses family exspecially if that family isn't so accepting of you...some people are like that like my adopted grandmother said she didn't know why her daughter took us in and that she should give us back numerous times...    sometimes it was o.k. for us we had fun and had cousins...but that was the family we were given|`|nqcnylFpaa	i am a adopted parent    ya i was nervous but it was the good kind    he was 8 years old but now is 9    my wife could never get pregnant but we both decided to adopt long before we found out she couldn't    no i have or never will regret|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	Of course I want to meet my birth parents, in fact I'm going through a process right now to find them.  My life would be a !@ $ of a lot different, I cna't picture it though, but I know I'm better of where I am now, than I would have if I wasn't adopted, I've never seen my mom met my dad briefly for a few weeks when I was little, don't remember much. They aren't together anymore, and I know they were financially struggling, and I wouldn't have been happy. They made their decison and I now know that it was for the best(though I didn't think that when I was little).  I was adopted at age 8, I was in foster homes since I was 2, I lived with my paternal grandmother until she was too sick to take care of me(and DSS came and took me away, DSS= Department of Social Services)  I do have siblings, one I live with and he is not adopted and is my adoptive parents biological son. I have no relation to them. I also have half-siblings, I know they exist but I've never met them, I could have more for all I know.   There are dark moments when you do wish for different adoptive parents, but then you realize you wouldn't be happy anywhere else.  Hope this helped.|`|GTZa0H9waa	Ok,a heads up,my story is a bit confusing,I was adopted by my grandparents and grew up calling them mom and dad and I always thought I had 2 brothers and 2 sisters but really the 2 brothers were my uncles and 1 of my sister was my aunt the other my real mom,my mom was 16 when I was born,so my grandparents ended up adopting me when I was real littler    Have you ever wanted to meet your birth parents?-I have met my mother plenty of times,but I have never met my dad and I wish to    If you were with your birth parents, do you think your life would have been more better?-No way! my parents were 16&18 my dad was a beater and a stealer,once he left my mom couldn't take care of me,so for a few months she tried but then she gave me to my grandparents,and they took care of me and they've given me a great life,my mom could've never given me that,neither could my dad    At what age did you get adopted?-They didn't legalize it til I was about 6 but I honestly couldn't remember it I never even knew about this situation at that age    Do you have any siblings?-I have younger half sister    Have you ever wish for different adopted parents?-Not at all,sure sometimes I get annoyed of my grandparents(who I still call mom and dad) but im glad they were my parents,if it was anyone else gosh,it'd probably be a harder situation.|`|AA10199189	i am neither adopted nor an adoptee but i think you will get a "yes" to the  last question in each section, simply because there will usually be a point in a person's life where they feel like that.  maybe you should ask  what triggered it, so you get a better understanding.  am looking forward to some interesting answers
V6r4RPI5aa	why don't u fill a box with 41 things that she would like, for example her fave choc bar, a framed photo etc    or 41 things that begin with the first letter of her name, i think thoughtful gifts are the best.|`|rBAfSiKhaa	whoa our moms birthdays are close me and my dad are getting my mom a new cell phone and we remodeled our house so it was also kinda a present|`|RDgyb7W8aa	fix her breakfast in bed and have her do absolutely nothing on her birthday.  Cook, Clean, do everything she does around the house on her birthday.  Get a family picture that day & have it framed.  Take her to the beauty parlor for a hairdo.  Just make her feel she is Queen for a Day.|`|Iv3QRoZiaa	I agree with the comment about getting her a gift cert. to have a family photo taken. that's a good idea. something else that might be good would be to make her a scrapbook of the family. i did that for my mom last year and she loved it. its kind of time consuming but it's worth it.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Give her a certificate to have a family portrait taken at the Mall.  It doesn't cost that much and she will love it for years to come.|`|lGS1zOd6aa	your buying something for a mummy
029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	No, and I'll tell you why. When I was 21 with a full-time job and living with my boyfriend, we went totally broke because you don't account for the unexpected things happening and all the bills adding up every month. Do yourself a favor and save some money, so you have something to fall back on in an emergency. Our relationship nearly fell apart due to the stress of living together.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	I really think you need to date for about 1 year to determin if he is the right man for you.  Then get married, have children...it probably would be good to make sure you have finished school first.  College???  This is only my opinion, take it for what its worth...plus I been there and done that...very tough, will not do it again unless I am in a commited relationship (like married first).|`|QvhPJAKyaa	if ou feel that our read and that our gonna be together, and its not just gonna be a short relationship, then go for it :) x|`|D6kwriPxaa	Are you going to college?  Do you have a job?  What are your plans as far as a career?    I would recommend against it until these types of questions are answered.  Too many people make these types of decisions at your age, get pregnant, and then their life is just a long road of poor jobs and poverty.|`|01pY6dW9aa	No I don't think so.  Go to college/university first, settle down, and then get a place.|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Living together can be great, but it could also open many new doors to a whole lot of problems. You need to weigh all the risk factors, such as, getting sick of each other, splitting the money and bills, taking on household chores, and so on. Don't put your money together, if you're smart you'll keep your money and he'll keep his (because you never know if you're going to break up in the future) but of course, split the rent, it's only fair. If you guys do end up breaking up, you'll both have to sell the place and move out..doesn't sound fun. Ask yourself if you see yourself with him for a very, very long time. If the answer is yes, and you really feel like he's the one, then yes I say go for it. Just don't be surprised when you guys get in a fight every now and then, because you might reflect on this and see it as a mistake. You're still extremely young and living with someone is a very big responsiblity. I wish you all the luck in the world!|`|zqiOlo3caa	I think that if that's really what you want then you should. If you feel like you have been dating long enough, want to make that commitment, and feel like it will work then why not?!|`|fhnYTyiuaa	No way its too soon. Once you move in together, eventually you wil get sick of each other and someone will end up cheating.|`|NpKGQFvTaa	Ofcourse you should :).  If you really want to don't let anyone stop you. Just make sure you work out your budget BEFORE you move. Rent gas electric etc.    I am moving out at 18 as well :) (maybe sooner :P)|`|lSl2Arlpaa	its a big plunge but if you feel ready then go for it! my friend is moving in with her boyfriend in september and shes only 19 :)|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	he is not a man yet and no you should not. men arent men by age but by action. i am 19 and i am not a full man yet. wait at least 2 years and see if he still loves you.|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	That's crazy!! no!!!!      You should wait and see what happens... Not living together will add to the excitment!|`|0Yn6n8Qbaa	I think that up  to you. I  would  base it on how good the relationship going. I when though the same thing and i believe it bought us closer.|`|c87f27f0437532e03040d093f68f1231aa	how long have you guys been together? do you think you're ready for that commitment? do you think he is? do you think this will be a lasting relationship? and if its not, do you think you're ready to just live with someone even if it's not forever or if it doesn't lead to marriage??|`|H0oylQOwaa	why not ur both adults get ur own life, space, Freedom|`|a48b4FhKaa	well think it out good becuz once u see him ever single day nd night his probably is gonna get tired of u are maybe ur gonna get tired of him im telling you this becuz alot of my friends went threw the same thing|`|BrRrtMQqaa	If you guys have that much trust in each other and you have stable jobs then I say why not.  Its a big step but its exciting.  Make sure that you're ready though cause once you move in its hard to move out.  You build a lot of things over time when you sharea place and its hard to just start over.  But if you think you're ready go for it and have fun.

e1884e932807e2ae04ca848e7bccb863aa	I'm shy and I struggle the same as you.  I think people that are not shy don't understand.  They trivialize shyness as a choice.  I think talking to a professional counselor is the way to go.  Also, read books on shyness.  It's worth the investment... yourself.
Yg51SGlsaa	I'm 21 now and in my first serious relationship. He's 2nd bf.    Not weird at all, you just haven't found someone that special yet.  Keep an eye open though you never know where they'll pop up|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Don't panic. Its okay, not everyone's the same. I was 18 when I first got married, I got divorced when I turned 22. Sometimes, when you jump into a serious relationship at a young age, things won't work out! Maybe when you get into yours, you'll be ready :)|`|pNqjsJn7aa	i was 18....just relax...u should be in a relationship only when u feel 4 the person on the other side and nt just bcoz everyone is going into one|`|0aW15UFGaa	its not weird, if u havnt found some one u fink is spicel euff, then not ur fult relly is it|`|nlsayGJKaa	15 and my mom always told me yur first love is yur first hartbrake       so like i dont no =]|`|A2Xg3Hsiaa	I was 28 when I had my first serious relationship.   There nothing wrong with not having a serious relationship by any age, or for that matter, being single the rest of your life, without ever having had a serious relationship!  Relationships develop over time.   They can neither be forced, nor rushed into.   It may sound trite, but there is someone for everyone in this world.    When you meet that person things will evolve naturally and it will be worth the wait.   In the interim, have fun!   Surround yourselves with quality people.  Make meeting new people and doing new things your passion!   Be a kind and generous man and the world will be your oyster!    Good Luck!

You arent a loser for being 21 without a serious relationship
ub2Dtzn0aa	Your instincts are correct. Something is going on with him and those sites. If your in an exclusive relationship with him then be direct and let him know you want him to be honest or its over. If your not satisfied with his response, move on.
3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, it is okay.|`|bPXlYHlDaa	Um it depends how long you already knew her before you started dating her. If it's only 3 to 5 days, then it's too soon and a little weird.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	That is way too soon to be saying such a strong sentiment. Obviously neither of you fully appreciate what "love" is - wait until you really feel it to say it.

wpi36XBAaa	If there was a court order with regarding the amount of child support and he was in arrears at the time you turn 18, yes he does have to keep paying until the amount is paid in full. It doesn't disappear just because you had your birthday. And Interest may be accruing too.   If there was no formal order of support, just a private agreement between the two parents then its possible he will get away with not paying anything any more. Sorry.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It depends on what the original order said.  Some go until the child graduates college at 23 or 24.    Just because he hasn't paid doesn't mean he isn't responsible for the money owed.  When the child turns 18 he/she can petition the court to get the payments (back support) made directly to them.  Nice little nest egg for college.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It depends on the state you live in.  In my state the support stops at 18.  Some states it continues if you are a full time student/graduate from college/turn 21 or some designated age.    If all he is giving your mother is $20.00 what does it matter?    The best way to get money from a dad is make yourself part of his life, so that he knows you, has bonded with you, is proud of you and wants to give you the shirt off your back.|`|DjircW6waa	It depends on what the court ordered him to pay.  Your mom can take him to court for back support owed.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	no, he wont have to pay any more, but he will have back child support, which he can pay or not but if he doesnt your mom can go after him legally for it, she'll have to probably hire a lawyer, but she can get him to pay all the money he never paid in one lump sum  if he has it, or they'll take it from his checks|`|FtyLwqR5aa	If he was ordered to pay support, then he must pay till he is paid off. you can sue him and get all that he owes you.|`|00b0f9ddac86ff60efd1e128d1e3d175aa	no|`|ff32225b284101d05a2982908b6b5febaa	he owes the back child support. Was there ever a child support order in place? he would owe the amount per month times how many months he did not pay. If there was no child support order I am not sure he has to pay|`|VEi3R0craa	it depends how your state works I know in Philadelphia, Pa child support stops when the child turns 18 or graduates high school which ever one comes first|`|yAZq4SLaaa	not positive, but I have been told that when you turn 18 YOU can SUE HIM for your back child support..check with social services? Maybe they can help.Good luck.|`|IcnilUuUaa	Yes he does if he still owes.  My mom still receives child support checks whenever my dad decides to pay and I am 27.|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	Check the laws in your state but if you are still in school, then yes, he will probably be required to pay child support until you are 21. Again, check your state laws to verify that and it ONLY applies if you are still in school (high school and college).

LMTCohHyaa	i hate to tell you that the fact that ur 13 is bringing alot of these issues up...ALL 13 yr olds are getting yelled at and doing bad on quiz's....all i can say is that if your parents cant see that you were sick, (and letting you stay home was their call im guessing,so they shouldve called ur teachers and ask them about study guides etc.) they are selfish and arent thinking about your age and what kids your age are feeling....ask them to think back to when they were 13 and how they felt about their parents.....i also suggest writing all your situations down and especially write down how they make you feel---(dont forget to hide this !!) that way later you can read them and see how you deal with each situation differently and what you can do next time---also if you have no one to vent to then you need to get it out on paper....i HATED BEING 13and didnt think it would ever pass....but it did...and now I decide who and what makes me feel what emotion---CONTROL--its sad but ur parents ARE in control, so you do just have to listen to them or it will be harder than you expected. i hope you can just blow off their emotions and pay attention to your own. i hope i helped|`|r0d37w2kaa	It is unfair. Tell your dad he is being unreasonable, talk to him, it helps!|`|usFWXupbaa	It sounds like your dad only wants you to succeed. He just wants to help you out. But, if you are sick then your sick and yes it is hard to concentrate when your all stuffy and tired. If it only happened a few times then I can understand your point of view. But if it happens all the time, I can understand your dad.   Don't get so stressed out about it just if you get upset walk away to calm down then when he's calm tell him how you feel. Hopefully he understands.   Wish you the best of Luck!! :)|`|AA10199189	dads can be like that!  then they calm down and grudgingly admit (to themselves, or possibly to mom) that they overreacted.  in part it is because they are brought up always to have a stiff upper lip, to take responsibility, not to show (positive) emotions and generally to be "manly" - which includes a lot of yelling and stomping for effect.    show him the study guide and forget about his reaction.  your mom knows how you were, and she understands.
P4va0y5Paa	How bad were the pics, just some hard R rated or are we talking full on porn? It will blow over if it wasn't that bad, but I bet her folks will get her a phone without a camera now.

If you weren't the reason, someone else was.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	This has absolutely NOTHING to do with you.    Nothing.

Just forget about it.|`|H0oylQOwaa	say u didn't know about it. It was for one of her girlfriends who wanted it for art work. Act mad at her near her parents as if u knew nothing about it.

Its the right thing to do|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	Well,  lets see.   Shall we look at this from the parents' point of view?    "My daughter has naked pictures of herself on her phone.  I wonder why she would do that?  Its not like she doesn't KNOW what she looks like naked.  Only ONE reason to have naked pictures,... and that's to SHOW to other people.   AHHHH.... and the boyfriend is attempting to lie to me that he hasn't seen them.   He must think me a COMPLETE idiot."      You attempt to lie about seeing these pictures and you will find yourself branded as a liar.    Sure, daddy and mommy are going to be pissed.   But you know,  THAT'S what parents do.  You say your close to her parents .... I say, "Prove it."   Talk to them.  If they like you as much as you indicated, then a simple conversation isn't going to hurt anything.    And it just may keep you from becoming a liar.
Rkt8tnUzaa	in contrast to what most people are saying i think it is right for you to be ready to move on and to do so.    but you really shouldnt try to hard just let things work them selves out =]     but you do deserve someone to treat you muchhhhh better then your ex has. no one deserves to be cheated on. that is just horrible.     im sure your a great guy, so just be patient someone will come soon enough.    dont settle for less, you truely deserve the best :)    good luck   =]|`|goP5E0Kxaa	She cheated on you it seems because you have a low sense of self worth , value , confidence. Just out of a long relationship you would think you would be confident, at ease enough around women to ask another one out, or to at least socialize until you get asked out.    You sound like a nice guy, another hint is that you seem desperate , or misguided, what can I do to get another girl attracted to me....    What does attraction really have to do about it, if its not personal, your own thing, and real ? We can't tell you how to attract the right woman.

aNIiGpzeaa	i think you did the right thing. and if doing the right thing makes your BOTH of your best mates mad at you, i think its about time you find new best mates. try approaching them at school and if neither of them understand, then forget about it. if 'best mates' cant find a way to forgive/understand then, i really doubt how true their friendship was to you|`|oZ1LptzFaa	get a ****** life, asshole!!!|`|Xhy6VEzOaa	try to catch your friend at school or something and confront her about this  tell her what you were thinking at the time...it was wrong, and she shouldn't have stooped that low and messed with them (even if they did "ruin" her life..which they probably didn't really)  maybe tell her u are sorry for not telling her how you felt about it b4..  honestly, this girl either got way to carried away with these guys, or isn't a very nice person  so if she doesn't accept your apology, that's her loss really...you did the right thing  you could try to talk to her after things have cooled down
aNIiGpzeaa	your gut intstincts will kick in and you will get signs from you conscience. doubting is also a sign, so consider how she has treated you in the past|`|zo1lvjLlaa	you can't really stop them from doing it but, i've been in that situation before. you just have to notice when they come around; like with me i noticed they hardly talked to me until something was going on with them, and they need someone to talk to about it. unless they had something going on they wouldn't speak to me. it's a bad spot to be in, especially if your trying your hardest to be there for them and be a good friend then they are treating you wrong.|`|yIxLi8r6aa	I always listen to my gut feelings.  There is always a sign or a feeling to let you know.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Follow your instinct, if you think somethings not right it usually is.

zIjoaj3Baa	Unfortunately, you can't do anything about it really. It's all up to her. Just comfort her and make sure she understands you know you messed up and did something wrong. Tell her your sorry and just justify that you care you messed up and that you know it was wrong. Eventually she'll forgive you and if she doesn't then you'll have to move on.|`|4sK0aJlDaa	What did you do and i will tell you|`|4eLLjTzzaa	We cannot MAKE another forgive us.  We can invite them, we can motivate them, we can encourage them.  We cannot force them.  Forgiveness is granted freely or not at all.  But don't confuse forgiveness with reconciliation or "forgetting".      Forgiveness means not requiring the other person pay you back.  Most of the things we can't forgive people for are things they can't give back to us, anyway.  Our childhood, our innocence, our public standing.  Someone hurt us--took something from us they had no right to take--and they probably can't do anything to make it right.  My unforgiveness only accomplishes one thing: it keeps me in the pattern of continuing to lose to them.  I am still losing peace of mind, restful sleep, constructive relationships because I'm spending my energy on not forgiving.  It doesn't hurt my enemy--it just keeps hurting me.  So my enemy 'wins' again.  Forgiveness gives me the opportunity I need to heal.    Reconciliation is an attempt to pay back some of what is lost...or, at least, to mend it.  Forgiveness absolutely does NOT require reconciliation.  Reconciliation requires some degree of forgiveness, though, because it implies a mutuality in re-building the relationship, whatever form it may take.      Forgetting has nothing to do with either forgiveness or reconciliation.  We cannot flush our memory banks.  What forgiveness and reconciliation open the door to is the possibility of building something NEW.      When you say you want your gf to forgive you, you probably also mean you want to be reconciled to one another and an opportunity to re-build.  You can't make her do that; she has to be convinced you are a good risk to try again.  All you can do is show her by your behavior you can be trusted; it's called a track record.    All this takes time.  It might seem better for a while and then seem to revert.  Don't get discouraged, just keep communicating and doing what's right.  You can't do anything about her, you can only do something about you, so do your best.    Hope you work it out.
QdCwBSVQaa	Your boyfriend won't like sentimental or handmade stuff as much as you want him to.  He may be nice about receiving that kind of thing, but it doesn't mean he actually likes it.  This include underwear, framed pictures, mix CDs, and scrapbooks.    My suggestions for a perfect gift is to get him tickets to an event he wants to attend (concert or sporting event), preferably one that you can enjoy together.  On the envelope, write him a note telling him how much you love him.  (Don't bother buying a card from Hallmark; that's a wasted $4 on something that he will throw away as soon as you're not looking).  Present the tickets to him along with something you baked for him (cookies, brownies, whatever he likes).|`|zOIgzIy4aa	maybe get a gift set of cologne and aftershave.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	What does he like? Cologne is always a crowd favorite. Or you could try candy (guys like it too) or boxers with hearts on them. Don't spend too much - it's really a holiday for the ladies :)|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i wish i was your boyfriend. im 23, and a girl named kerry gave me her number at a bar once.    she didnt answer when i called her    my last girl drew me a picture of myself on valentines day and made it into a card. it was all she had to do. i still have it, even tho she broke my heart and left me for another guy|`|CjafsNslaa	video games, thats what my husband always wants. just find out which 1 he wants and get it. if he is into that stuff.|`|nci2WOYXaa	Doesn't matter.

Also, something that can remind him of you at work. Or maybe something fun for a kinky night in bed, since that is a mans favourite part of v-day. or  maybe a naughty picture for his wallet of you?     hmm.. ideas are endless.|`|Lq56mwWKaa	you can take the girls' advice and get candy or some other valentine-themed gift but guys are not the type that like this stuff. They are good at pretending to like them. Try something you know he will like. If you're not sure, you can never go wrong with electronics or video games.
A7aDi3bRaa	I am in the same boat. I've found that the best way to get your point across is calmly, consistently, and don't react when he starts pushing buttons. My boyfriend has a MySpace and is constantly chatting up girls. I finally deleted mine because I couldn't stand seeing that crap. Anyway, if he claims they are "platonic", then you make some friends of your own and stop the double standard Bullsh*t. Just make sure he knows when he crosses the line and why it is unacceptable.     If the sex is an issue, I would force myself to abstain for awhile - work it out at the gym forget about it. When you are both too old or sick to have much sex, then what is holding you together? I've found that sometimes a person has to be in really scary circumstances before she finds out who her true friends are...Ive heard plenty of stories about women who break their back trying to care for their man, only to find him gone, cheating or unsupportive when she needs him most...    Sometimes its hard to stop spoiling someone you love, but it in the long run it would be a favor for the relationship. I bought my BF a new laptop... but I get pissed when he uses it to chat up other girls, ignore me for it instead, and play games instead of applying to jobs- we gotta stop being fools! It alright to baby the man you love a little, but NOT if it starts jeapordizing your career/personal stability. Before you know it, he might assume love = gifts & servitude. Then selfish and bratty when he feels entitled to get his way. Your love can be unconditional, but not necessarily your commitment. Why be loyal to a man who can't get his act together?    Like Aretha sang, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means! Read between the lines! Look up the definition of "codependent"! Do not be an "Enabler"!  Tough love baby!|`|yU5ZR7a8aa	He is using you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  you are getting played and hes starting to find you  boring which is why hes acting the way he is please i feel extremely sorry for you cut yourself off from him before you get hurt more!!!!!!!!|`|P9oduCUgaa	30? & he has a myspace that for kids.  i'm 21 & deleted mines becuase i'm too old for that.  n-e-ways.  he sounds like a bum.  make him get a job babe.  i don't think he love you since hes flirting with girls he dosnt even know.  talk to him babe.  i don't want to hear that you got hurt.|`|EdidZdtlaa	demand what you want. tell him to stop flirting with girls cause your supposed to be his main girl. if he controls the sex then you can control the money. and maybe you could do it to him sometimes. turn him on then walk out the room making him want more and see how he likes it. if things get too hot and you guys arent happy i would leave him. he dosent seem loyal. good luck|`|jGKGlxAuaa	There is something strange going on. Quit supporting him, and find a real man. All men have penises. Find a good one!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Seriously, drop this loser. He should not be doing those things sexually and he definately shouldn't be myspaceing whores while a good woman is taking care of him. It don't matter how many good things he has, it sounds like his bad aspects outweigh them.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	You need to DUMP him. He sounds like a total lazy bastard who is taking advantage of YOU. You can do sooo much better!! It doesn't matter if he helps out around the house! He's lazy, he needs a ******* job and he is sorry! You are taking care of a grown man! He needs to be working! How can you let him talk to other women?? You must have self esteem issues. Please, do yourself a favor and leave him. You can do so much better, sweetie! The sex can't be that great for you to literally take care of him!
3wFt9fyZaa	Are you a B!atchh??  it doesnt matter how beautiful a girl is, if she begins to be a pain...I would leave also.    Check your innerbeauty, not outer.|`|AA12302228	well he was a charity case,so now your project has found his feet, its time you found your own,going with someone you consider ugly and safe,just shows your own insecurity.good look to the guy.hahaha grow up|`|TMi1GhSHaa	guess he wasnt all that ugly to begin with cause if that were true you would not of dated him.. there has to be at least SOME physical attraction going on there.. or you might as well date your dog lol.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Maybe it's you that is ugly hun?    Just a thought.
d4HQLK4maa	If pants or skirt is on then i prefer a thong... i hate seeing panty lines    If you aren't wearing anything but undies, then go with bikinis or boyshorts... they are extremely sexy on an almost naked body!|`|n6oKAac1aa	Either when they are crumpled up on the floor.

6tQZppzOaa	cuz its so funny watching guys hold their balls and turn red and scream.|`|e98RKB35aa	Because most guys think with their balls and girls don't like that. You piss off a girl that is just what they go for first. Some slap you in the face but most kick you right in the balls. They think it is a way for a guy to get the hint.|`|0k1y3Xn4aa	Hey,  Well , this guy was being so annoying calling me names. I got so angry and aimed right there. I felt so good after, because I know that is the most painful area for guys.    It Made Me Feel Better. Lol :).    Good Luck,  :)|`|nchbYWCRaa	i'm not gonna offend any women but if were being mean we don't deserve a kick in the balls everyones has an attitude women can be mean too but we don't punch or hit them (some guys do) who hits someone just cause there being mean thats stupid and a way to start something you didn't want  the only reason a strike like that should be done is if your being attacked|`|L38M9lrLaa	why you giving them a reason to..|`|nci2WOYXaa	Cause most are very vindictive and have to cause as much pain as possible|`|qy07K2k5aa	They know that it hurts.|`|vnKO3h4Jaa	cuz sometimes you guys are mean and deserve it k? :)|`|M63kq3AYaa	The ones that do that are just abusive filth (unless it's self defence) and should be avoided, or beaten to a pulp by decent women.|`|AA11707529	you hang around the wrooooooooooong people!!  :(
K2ecmzInaa	HAHAHA! Oh, I mean, uh... your best bet is to pay her back like a responsible young lady.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	damn that sucks. idk what you can do unless you have then money to replace it. or you can just wait for her to forgive you. she will get over it its just going to take some time. just apologize and give her some space till she is ready to forgive you. sorry i cant give you better advice.|`|ECvEknqtaa	wat ripped again???????  :O|`|aNIiGpzeaa	you need to take responsibility for your actions and promise her you will pay her back. which you NEED to. work it off gradually|`|5gqb2uzFaa	tell her that she can have anything that you have!!!|`|Xhy6VEzOaa	tell her how sorry you are  maybe u can sew it back together..?  you could buy a new one..but like you said, it is expensive  it's justa  bag, she'll get over it..give it some time  if not..she's kind of materialistic|`|SKh7P8O5aa	Just apologize, and try to sew it back together, If you have to spend 500 dollars to buy a new one, that is not a good friend, just say you want to fix it, and if you don't know how to sew, find someone who does, and do it. It adds fun-ness to the bag, you can say, "Oh this is where she ripped it, Haha." and laugh abou it later.
G7duxkjBaa	yes, she likes you aha i can tell. girls flirt alot and the more they flirt with one person they start to like them more.     just be like hey your wicked cool and stuff and i was just wondering if you needed someone to be there for you   ..blah blah blah  or you can just say hey i really really like you your nice,funny, and sweet and i really want to be with you give me a chance    GOOD LUCK =]|`|9PICw7L6aa	do this thing where yall like spell words for your names like for example if your name is albert for she would put amazing or awesome or stuff like that you know well with her name like do the same thing and with the words just kind of tell her you like her but yeah... idk i hope this helps..

If she going to say not really, then tell her you have some plan for her,   Then ask her on the phone will you be my valentine? It is not good to ask her in personal because she might like you that way might not I am pretty sure she likes you, so this is the best way, and if she accepting then Enjoy your victory..  Best of luck|`|dNF0fZrSaa	Sounds like she likes you to me...just tell her, be upfront with it...|`|DJNAm0uTaa	it sounds like she does like you. if you shouldnt beat around the bush... just tell her because she probably will be happy with the outcome. say something like "have you ever thought about us as more than friends?" she will get the hint. hope this helps!|`|lSl2Arlpaa	its a tough one, she may like you or she may not    a good idea is to ask her for some advice on 'a girl you like' and talk to her about er, well her...but without her knowing its her if you get what i mean    and see what sort of reaction she gives :)|`|uMciSpKPaa	if she is your really good friend, i would just tell her, if she doesnt feel the same way dont sweat it and just go back to the way things were|`|fRgFmOksaa	Actually its pretty simple. She thinks of you as one of the girls.|`|ZDjBMsVUaa	you should show sighs that your into her, and on the 14th, tell her how u feel. its always good to ask then to never know at all. and if she dosent, then ask if you can still be friends. its the best way to go ^_^|`|LVkghg0gaa	This is What I did. I just ask him if he liked me if he said yes. I just Asked if he wanted to go out if he said no i am just like ha my brother-or sister had my phone. I f you don't have a brother or sister, say your best friend|`|AA10593735	This is a very sensitive subject...I think the best way would be to ask her, but pose it as a hypothetical question...as in, "let's pretend for a moment that we were dating, and..." (fill in the rest of the blank with your own question or scenario) and watch her reaction and listen to her response.  Good Luck!
A2Ne8sdFaa	just say "Hello" and tell them about yourself. Be very friendly, and maybe through in a couple big words. I like to do that to make myself sound smart. Maybe,..    Dear blah blah blah:    Hello my name is ____. I am your niece/nephew/grandaughter/grandson. I am trying to contact you due to the fact that I have not spoken with you in a few years, and it would be nice to be in touch. Well, first of all I live in _________, and I go to school at _______. I am really liking my life, but it would be cool to have a bigger family other than my mom and dad.       Tell them more here, why your writing to them. Maybe something like.:    My purpose for writing to you is just to be in contact. I wanted to just say hello and tell you how we are all doing. (maybe just tell them smething about whats going on in your life, but dont make it too long.)    THis is the part where you wrap it up. Ask them to please respnd. Maybe like...    I hope we stay in contact. Because I really miss you dearly, and I hopw we could be closer. I wanted to know if you could possibly respond. It wwould be very nice, as soon as possible.      (now you thank them) Thank you so much for taking your time to read my letter, and please write back soon.    Sincerely,        (signature here)      (your name here)            lol hope it helped|`|Iy36xZMOaa	Why are you contacting them now???|`|J2Rf0xQBaa	I would start off by reminding them of your family ties.  "I am you niece, granddaughter, whatever." Go from there, just write from your heart and you will be fine.
FlZnL08waa	OK first i dont want tO BE MEAN BUT  are u just making this stuff up i mean like ur knife moving COME on  are u sure it moved. some peole are so depressed that they start to c things its like the sixth sense|`|Iy36xZMOaa	Maybe, who knows.   There are lot of mysterious things in life we can't always explain.|`|sMo7Wbvzaa	no! come on that is something that a second grader would ask!|`|uQZQTAAlaa	maybe it is maybe it isn't. Keep checking for more strange stuff.
Xhy6VEzOaa	she might be jealous...  yeah tell him nicely (and make he doesn't tell her you told him..you don't want her to dislike you even more)  just say your brother heard her saying mean things about you
ovDqPtg8aa	too bad, i'm a girl and answering.  well, show confidence. ask him out. what is there to lose?  more and more girls are asking the guys out lately. as guys are becoming more clueless ...|`|9Kax4Kekaa	I agree don't do it by texting, but yeah ask him.  Maybe he doesn't know you're interested in him and will never ask you.|`|P58Vjq71aa	You should if you want to go out with him. There's no guarantee he'll ask you out. Don't do it by texting - that's the worst way to do it. Go visit him and see how he's feeling and then ask him out while you're there.
GWpaSFdtaa	Not often but sometimes. I have a lot of gay friends so it happens.|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Everyday, damn these good looks.
Xhy6VEzOaa	looks like you made up your mind that you do not want to stay friends..that's most of the process  first cut off all contacts from them   put/throw away any pictures, gifts, ect from her..(you may want to keep them for the memories though)  keep busy with other friends/activities to forget about her    if you start to wish you were friends again, remember why you ended the friendship in the first place|`|aNIiGpzeaa	been there done that!!! well, you cant FORGET her persay, but you can lock her out of your life. just find a better friend who wont ditch you for her bf. girls should stay strong and not let guys get in the way of a friendship. eventually, you will forget why you ever clung on to her. just makesure you find a better 'replacement' so you dont set up the same situation
xqccgfaYaa	well my best advice for you is to call virgin mobile and ask them for it but if that doesnt help go to virginmobileusa.com log in and u can change your phone number from there and they will give you a new MSID

You'll have accept the fact hes shorter then you, Unless youre sitting.|`|9EW08emXaa	Katie Holmes is taller than Tom Cruise and she always looks dumb when she tries to slump down, so definitely don't do that.  Just stand tall. No biggie.     For pictures, prom pics always look cute if you are sitting on his lap, one arm around him.     The photographer is paid to make you all look good, so he/she should have some good suggestions too.|`|72688aae7e472777b624289e7b6159acaa	if you wore a dress that is long - you could also bend your knees...it wont show in the pic|`|sKBGfO85aa	please dont sit for your prom photo.  you need to show off your dress! if your dress is long you can bend at the knees a Little and will be shorter than him. The ohotographer will help you.|`|TROWOirBaa	u can sit and he can put his hand on ur shoulder or hug u  or u could do the whole stairs postion where u both stnad on diffrnt stars steps and u r on the lower stair step n he on the higher one|`|oOqSpBmbaa	You on your knees :D  No but seriously, what does it matter?   But as it apparently does you sit on a chair with him hand on your shoulder    Sor'ed|`|sPiwb8Hraa	If a nice looking comfortable chair is available, sit with a leg crossed into the chair, and he can stand on your right, which would mean the picture would come out with him on the left. And people read left to right usually. I take you back to history, from the black and white Adam's Family series. Remember Morticia was taller than her husband, and she sat while he stood for the main advertising photos. This was acceptable and it still is, even though the Adam's Family was a horror sitcom.    Ask the photographer which side your bf should be on, to be sure. But I'm almost + he should turn out on your left IN THE PHOTO.    One last comment and I gotta run. When you see stars walking down the street with their bf's, the man is usually on their right. This is because it is the protective position and posture for the man, when out and about. Why? Because the man should be streetside, to protect the woman. Think about it: you are walking down the street and something happens. So what does your bf do if there is a problem, push you into the street!!?? NO! He pushes you STORESIDE, to protect you. But remember that is a walking pose, and not stationary.    So take those pointers and go from there.    P.S. Not every woman will allow the bf to be streetside. And she has the right of course, to not walk storeside. But as general rule of thumb and in most cases, she will be storeside. Because that is the traditional posture. Food for thought: What side of the street does Ellen walk on when she is with Portia? Think about that!!!|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	uhm, you sitting on something and his hand on your sholder behind you.
xJ2kcJsraa	i dunno bro, try...open up.    i know it's kinda hard to talk to someone you like, hah?    but give it a shot....it's not that hard.|`|sGWQeDg3aa	If she really "fancys" you then keep going at it, keep flirting with her. Then try to go on a date like the movies, make sure you talk to her a lot. Then if you guys enjoy you're date and each others company, ask her out.|`|mgH6Sfvvaa	Maybe you shouldn't be using fancy as a verb, and capitalizing as if it were a noun.     Secondly best advice i ever got is stop being a *****, and be yourself.   This works.   If this girl ends up not liking you, just move on (it gets easier with time, but mostly with practice)|`|LH1a7Xuaaa	talk about general things - like weather...let the conversation build up until both of u feel more comfortable|`|oadMJWOCaa	do anything just dont do nothing thats like the worse thing to do|`|K0iFV73Gaa	If she loves you loads then she doesn't care what you say as long as it's nice or funny. Just talk to you.|`|yFLBDwMgaa	Go for her ;D|`|TfzzhYUXaa	Fancy? How old are you?     65? 72?   I fancy you........lol i would laugh in your face. Oh wait I am.|`|jVHvm3akaa	umm shes sounds cool haha butttt her and her boyfriend just broke up. maybe she says SHE LOVES YOU LOADS because your giving her advice and shes lonelyy    but dont be shy otherwise youll never have a chance bud|`|AA11289793	You just need to not care about what other people will perceive you as and be yourself with her around other people...|`|FjYjujn1aa	Ask her out. Simple and easy. If she likes you then she will say yes, you can even ask her on msn.|`|ptQBetAnaa	i agree wit melanie|`|tvWm1e4naa	being shy will take you nowhere. just be casual and treat her the way you treat your female friends. start with a smile and say hi.|`|mfFh1OAgaa	ell DONT talk to her on msn.    this kills relationships as you only talk to her on msn so you only know her there, not in real life.      yeah talk to her on msn but dont keep doing it. it makes things awkward.|`|xQGkWlSKaa	Ask he to hang out with you and a group of people. That way you won't be so shy. Then, if the night goes well, you can tell her that you had fun hanging out and that you would like to take her to dinner.|`|8BVEoMBraa	I think you talk funnnyyy. So dont talk to her in person she will barfffff!!!!|`|YGhtWspiaa	She just broke up with her bf but she loves you loads? Thats weird. If you like her so much just go talk to her. Good luck|`|L9MDzufnaa	Guys who use the word "fancy", or think it's a proper noun, never get laid!|`|yfrZowkfaa	just say hi, i love you jk|`|Hk1lmLQAaa	you need to man up and tell her whats up. if she cant handle it the worst thing she can say is NO. no problem.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	I'd be careful, but I'd say be yourself.  Talk to her about things you have in common.  You'll warm up.|`|E2Wv2Kv9aa	I'm not sure what you should say because I don't know her well and I don't know what she likes to do/talk about... however what I do know is that girls love CONFIDENCE! So really, as long as you say something and make the effort to talk to her without being nervous (or at least not showing that you are nervous) you are sure to win her over =)|`|k9RXrzluaa	just be a bit cautious, esp. when she just recently broke up with her boyfriend. you don't want to be on the receiving end of a rebound relationship.|`|7F2enSMDaa	I would continute to build the relationship as friends and then let nature take it's course. In her recent situation, she may want a strong friend before being with another bloke.|`|Luf2zbTKaa	try to start a conversation and see were it goes from there|`|a3jmdJMMaa	Lol. Idk what to say really. I think that she's kinda using you as a rebound to this other guy because theres like no way she can be like "Oh noes I broke up with him *emo*" to "I LOVE YOU" that quick. Hmm ... I'd say let her like chill a bit and ask her later when shes thinking more clearly|`|K7iR5wDBaa	If she's saying she loves you then that's a good sign. How old are you both? If you're younger than fifteen arrange something to do at a weekend like bowling/ cinema with a few mates ask her to come too with some friends then spend the day chatting to her so she gets the hint of how you are feeling.     If you're sixteen or over, get her number and build up a friendship. After a few weeks ask her out on a date.|`|oezTDqm5aa	It sounds like she's giving you the green light big time so there's no point in being shy, cause rejection seems highly unlikely..You don't appear to have communications problems with her on msn, so why not ask her to meet up for something casual like something to eat when you're online and take it from there? Good luck :)|`|AA11818174	just try to talk to her in person like you talk to her on msn. play it cool and friendly at first and then pop the question. :) good luck|`|40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	If she says she loves you already it doesn't mean she loves you like a boy friend but like a friend. Try talking to her a lot more and tell her how you feel. Maybe you can ask her on a date.|`|mMByiHaQaa	Don't feel shy if you know she feels the same way, because you can't make a fool of yourself trying to make her like you when she already does.    Good Luck    | The Stig ||`|P3xwPsICaa	She said she loves you? was it in a friendly way like "oh thanks! i love you loads!" or was she serious? cuz if it was in a friendly way then i would say hold off for a bit. especially since she just broke up with her boyfriend. after a while start flirting with her and maybe she will get the hint that your interested.|`|ti3Q3eLqaa	i think it's cute that your shy maybe you shud look me up. :) on bebo if you want. username- c_A_W|`|NZg4hIrYaa	i guess she doesn't really love you as she has recently broke up with her boyfriend, you are probably a love replacement.  try to think she is your friend but not girl friend.  it will sound better when a relationship start from friendship first.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	She loves you already? She's on the rebound so be on your guard.
bgdjtJepaa	If she has a favorite snack or something, try bringing her that.  Sometimes a little "comfort food" goes a long way.  Or try renting a funny movie.  I know one time there was a death in one of my sorority sister's families and we made a big card for her and all signed it.  Maybe you could get a bunch of friends or if you live in a residence hall get the residents on your hall to sign it.
9iUiImTVaa	You should tell him how you feel about him, that you like him as more than a friend. And find out how he feels about you.|`|5gqb2uzFaa	That you like him more than A friend!!!
AA10766729	Sadly, you open your commentary with her being a "beautiful, really cool wife."  But then you turn around and throughout the rest of your story, you tell how your wife over-reacts and blows things out of proportion and how she's now not speaking to you.  THAT is NOT a "cool" wife by any stretch of the imagination.    If your wife is so totally insecure, I'd recommend not going this year, just to put her mind at ease.  You're NEVER going to be able to be proven innocent, so you may as well not even try.  She'll get over it.  Just drop the subject, and if she should bring it up, tell her what's done is done, you can't UNdo it, so she should just drop it too.      If she can't or won't let it go, then suggest some marriage (and maybe some personal) counseling.    After NINE years of marriage, this should be a total non-issue.  She's overly sensitive in my female opinion!|`|AuKKjaxaaa	You failed to make it short.|`|UNZuciedaa	well, if you're going to be accused of something....may as well do it.  would suck to have her accusing you and giving you crap about it and not at least get the pleasure of actually doing it|`|TPPZp8IYaa	It still gets me to this day, why married men have this innate need or urge to go to strip clubs... and use excuses such as bucks nights etc to go to them... You say your wife is hot and you sound happy, so why in the hell go...A simple little two letter word.. Um I think it's called...NO! to your mates, isn't that hard to say surely. Fair Dinkum!!!!|`|aDIPIu7xaa	You and your friends sound like a bunch of homos.|`|sYEf626Aaa	You have got to be kidding me. A strip club? who cares? take her  to one and see if she likes it. i would just ignore her right back and   see how she likes it.  And why did you even have to make a promise not to tell your precious  wives? there is something called "guys code" that covers that situation.   i guess you and your friends missed that meeting. what a big waste of time  over nothing. Also the last place in the world you can get  lucky is a strip club  HEY KITTYKAT ON BEHALF OF ALL MEN THANKS FOR  NOT TRYING TO GET MARRIED AGAIN! YOU SOUND  LIKE A LOT OF FUN|`|fzIeGPZYaa	and you thought lying about it for a year would help anything?|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Guilty until death do you apart|`|kD6M3Banaa	have one of your buddies show this to question to your wife saying say... this is how much he loves you. I'lle remove my comment later.|`|SiniSj1eaa	She will get over it sooner or later.     Youve got some fixin to do though...|`|yFLBDwMgaa	Dear sir,         You screwed up miserably!|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	your wife sounds like a 16 year old brat.  Tell her to get the hell over it, grow up and move on.  Sheesh-- some grown men ended up at a strip joint and regretted it. Her "punishment" is worse than your crime.  You lied because you know she's a total beetch and can't handle the truth. "a tendency to blow things out of proportion" -immature and stupid you mean?  Tell her you thought she was a mature, adult woman who had enough faith in the marriage to put a stupid, meaningless incident behind her.   Come on dude, grow a spine, be a man and quit treating HER like the spoiled little brat she is.    Oh PS You know she'll never forget this. For the rest of your life, she'll bring it up whenever she wants to punish you. She'll say you betrayed her trust as an excuse to do or say (or buy) anything she wants.  It's what she's always done, isn't it?|`|pGF6Xdghaa	Henry,    I see how you can feel this way..  Even if you were having a fun time with your friends, they got you to do something that wasn't honoring to your wife, or to God.  I just would like to say that if you have apologized to your wife for upsetting her in any way by going there, and have repented to God, there isn't anything to worry about. God loves you, and so does your wife.  And I think you should know that.  Valentines day is coming up very soon. It's a perfect time to bury anything that might of offended her in any way.  Go out and buy something you know she would like.  It dosen't have to be roses, or chocolates like people do every year.   Those things are very special and nice, but her knowing how much you love her is the important thing here.. Write her a love poem about the two of you. Or make an album of the two of you doing things.  Go up to her and just hug her and let her know you don't want anyone but her..  Ask God to help you also..  He will..: )  you are very special Henry..  God bless you.  It will work out fine..:)|`|GwbFgThXaa	WOW!  So you screwed up.  Make sure she knows that you know that!  I admire her for boycotting you affections it is the only way for her to show you how much you really hurt her and shes smart enough to know it.   As of now you have two best friends:     1)  TIME (yes it really will heal all wounds) and      2)PERSISTENCE (keeping bathing her in flowers and apologize until your wallet is empty and face is blue)    Its safe to say that these trips are clearly off-limits for you for all eternity, but if you really love her as you say she wont have to make that choice for you, you'll make it yourself.  Good Luck!!|`|GeruGGOQaa	Quote..."Ok, I'll try to make this short."    Try again.  You failed miserably.|`|iXt3erseaa	Go home. Take flowers. Tell your wife you are sorry and that she is the most beautiful and wonderful woman in the world. Give her hugs and kisses (if she will let you) and tell her how stupid you were to a) go and b) try to hide it. She will forgive you eventually. But you may have to regain her trust. And one day, you will laugh at this...|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I actually took the time to read this, and sorry bucko, I am with your wife.  You lied for almost an entire year to her.  Big time dog house.  I advise you to be on your best behavior and thank your lucky stars once you get out of the dog house.  Endeavor to not go there again.|`|45azZvL9aa	Tell her you did not do anything with any lady, you were dragged in there.    TELL HER that you will NOT go on any more trips period.  I think that's a just punishment.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	Wow, this was long! But, yeah I don't blame her for being angry. You did lie to her even though you didn't do anything at the strip club. The point is, you lied either way. So, of course she's going to believe you probably did something because you couldn't tell her the truth. Just give it some time. Keep calling her and trying to get in contact with her. Apologize and tell her you were afraid to tell her the truth. She won't trust you for a long time, so you can forget about your boys night out.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	every day buy a rose and leave it on the table with a note that says im sorry, if you do it long enough im sure she will melt and forgive you I know I would!|`|JZdwV01saa	every one makes stupid moves in there life just try to get through to her and tell her that nothing happened and that you'll do anything to make the marriage work out.  tell her you don't want to lose her you were dumb enough (not saying that you r but id be really mad too) to do what you did and just try to keep making it right. it will take awhile hopefully your marriage isn't over. do what you can to convince her you didn't do any thing and you'll never do it again. good luck. you lied for a year so it will take her awhile|`|gfHutvEFaa	You lied. By not opening your mouth and telling her she now thinks you  didn't tell her because you did something wrong.    It'll blow over, but in the meantime, you'll have to be extra attentive, loving, TRUTHFUL, etc. This might take a couple weeks. Maybe even a couple months.    I would be pissed, BUT way more hurt if that happened to me.     Don't give up.|`|2pvtnd0gaa	you apologize until you bleed, as you do that you should think about how you would feel if your wife went out and saw a bunch of guys and their dongs dancing all on her friends, you being in that situation alone makes her question whether or not you did dance with them or do whatever. Its not quite cheating but it sure is a slap in the face.|`|CjafsNslaa	She will get over it in time. Just dont push her too far. Let her come to you or when she hints that she wants you around then be there. I dont see why she would be mad if you didnt do anything.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Sounds like another guy who stupidly got married and spit out a couple kids before they matured.  Now that you are 35 and "old" (which is about as stupid as you can get) you feel entitled to be "18 again".  You proved yourself immature and unwilling to provide honesty in your marriage, therefore you deserve as much fallout as you get.    THIS is exactly why I stay divorced.  Pigs like you are pigs for LIFE and I am sure your wife knows this too.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	So much for trying to make it short! Lol!!  Okay try talking to her again.  Just so she can ask you why?  My husband quit smoking 3 years ago, and started up again and for some unknown reason he was hiding it from me so he thought even though I could smell it, however, I threw his coat on to let the dog out and automatically threw my hands into his coat pocket, yup I pulled out that pack of smokes, and all he could do was look stupid.  Woman hate being lied to period.  She probably will be mad for a few days but she will get over it.  Keep pleading your case and let her know that she is the only one.  Curious though how did one of the wives find out, someone in the pack cracked or what?  You should of just told her.|`|gjQ65tnraa	She probably feels like you still aren't telling her everything.  Look at it from her perspective.  Not only did you go but you lied about it and now a year later you finally come clean so as only to avoid getting into even more trouble if she found out from someone else.     In her mind she is probably thinking that you only told her because you had to and not because you wanted to, and for all she knows there are other things you haven't told her because you don't have to.    The trust in your relationship has been completely compromised by this.    I know you know you really didn't do anything wrong and it was completely innocent.  But what can you do to prove it?    Unfortunately not very much.    Your best bet is to just keep trying.  Keep trying to talk to her until she finally gives in.  Then just explain how much you love her and care about her and how the strip club was incredibly boring and that is why you never mentioned it... because it wasn't a big deal to you and so you didn't think it would be a big deal to her.    Apologize profusely for not telling her everything and promise to never lie again EVER.  Then don't.    I think it is awesome that you have been together for 9 years and you still love each other and think each other is hot!  In today's society that is hard to come by.      Just keep trying until you can finally prove to her that you only want her and no one else.  It might take a while but you need to understand that she feels hurt and deceived and even when she forgives you, it will still take a while to fully regain her trust.    Good Luck    Oh and some flowers or dinner or something shiny wouldn't hurt either.|`|AA11573840	Obviously you didn't want to hurt her so you didn't tell, but it was only a matter of time before it leaked out. I am finally learning it is better to be up front and have a day of hell than get caught later and live there for weeks or months.  I went to a bachelor party and the same thing happened. Fortunately my GF is hot as well and I had no interest in screwing this one up, I told her before I even went there was a possibility I would be dragged into one and she said she already knew and trusted me. The trust has been broken your screwed for now. Things should calm down. Just keep on it, if she even saw your question posted here it shows effort and might win some brownie points. Good luck, I've been there, just been fortunate not in this category.|`|pErRGYH7aa	Married nine years and it's obvious who wears the pants in your family.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Gah!  Don't lie when you have nothing to lie about!!!  Most people trying to think about this situation logically would come to the conclusion that you lied because you had something to hide... not because you didn't have something to hide.  The problem with getting caught in a lie, no matter how trivial or stupid, is that it casts a shadow over everything else you say and do.    Firstly, you need to have a very frank talk with your wife about how her trust is extremely important to you and that you feel like a complete idiot for lying to her about something that there was no need to lie about in the first place.    She's hurt that it looks like you and your buddies have been having little conspiracies behind her back, and even if this was the only one ever created, how can you prove that to her?  She's also hurt that it seems that you don't trust her to react fairly to you.  Either you've discussed how she felt about strip clubs before you went or you didn't.  If you did and she said she didn't mind, then she now feels like you thought she'd flip out.  If you did and she said she did mind, then you have indeed betrayed her trust.  If you never spoke about it at all it seems that her thoughts and opinions don't matter to you.  As long as you go into trying to talk to her knowing and understanding what you're getting the silent treatment you at least have a chance to have a conversation with her.  She feels stupid that she believed you, and embarassed that her own husband has lied to her and is wondering what else she's been lied to about.  Be sincere, be repentant, and listen to what she has to say to you.    Good luck, you obviously didn't have nefarious intentions and hopefully she's willing to work this out with you.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	If you are as innocent as you sound, she should know in her heart that you are being truthful.  She might just be showing you with actions that it is not alright with her (if she did not get upset it might imply that she does not care).  Just appologize truthfully.  Maybe you should skip the night out this time to prove you are more interested in her then anything else.|`|BTFKBzqHaa	your wife is over reacting. you should have told her sooner:i would be mad if my spouse told me about his night at the strip club a whole year after he went (it makes it sound suspicious). Give it some time to blow over and don't be a Re-re next time something like this happens|`|Z2pY7QKOaa	Lets get the facts straight.  You went to dinner, heard some good music, and went to a strip club for a little bit.  Did you touch any other women? No.  Do you engage in any sexual activity? No.  Did you cheat on your wife in any way? No.  So according to the facts you didn't do anything wrong except lie to your wife and get caught.  I guess some women view strip clubs as a big deal but the truth is that you love your wife, didn't do anything to really jeopardize your marriage, and your faithful.  It's no different than watching a movie with nudity.  It's harmless.  Let your wife know your sorry and how much you love her.  Buy her some flowers, tell her you'll never set foot in another stripclub again, and surely she'll get over it.|`|d2621a5d288a523955507c1f284ea00baa	I think you messed up when you didn't tell her a year ago. It was good that you didn't do anything, and just stayed at the bar. Did you tell her that? I assume you did.    I bet she is more upset at you for holding something back than she is at you for going to the strip club. She's probably also wondering if there are other things that you have been keeping from her...    I'd just give her some space to sort it all out, but I'd keep telling her that you're sorry over and over again. It's going to take time for her to gain trust in you again, so you're going to have to do everything you can to let her know that she can trust you.    Try not to get upset at her for being mad -- keep your cool, and just keep telling her your sorry and that you shouldn't have kept it from her.|`|FBKg7oyQaa	You made a mistake. You said you are sorry. Now it is going to take some time for her to trust you again.|`|rj8unhcSaa	wow...um ok  where do i start?  So...your wife is mad at you for lying or going to a strip club? or both?  Have you tried talking to her about this? i mean this could all be a misunderstanding. I mean its not like you did anything, right? Its not like your wife has a perfect record...or does she?  anyways...  i donno it just seems like a misunderstanding to  me. She shouldn't be mad at you if you didn't really do anything wrong. Does she expect you to ditch your friends? Yes, you are married. Yes, you are faithful (so you say haha just kidding)   Maybe you should just have a talk with her. Let's say her name is Sarah. Just say something like " Hey Sarah, can we talk? i don't understand why you're so mad. I told you the truth and you know i've never had any contact with another woman or any intentions of ever doing anything with anyone but you. you're the most beautiful woman on the face of the planet and i wouldn't want to spend my live with anyone else..." then you could go into how beautiful your kids are and stuff. Make her cry (in a good way) and make your talk kind of emotional. some girls like that.  All you can do is try. Maybe you could do what i suggested and some other stuff some of the other people on here suggest.  best of luck man|`|HhCL30uUaa	I don't know how old your wife is but she is obviously old enough to be a mom to two kids and you guys have been together long enough to have those two kids.  Is there some underlying reason why she would be so very angry at this small infraction?  I mean you seem to really be crazy about her (not many men consider theirs wives "friggin hot" after just a short time being married much less nine years).  I would just try to tell her in a matter of fact, adult manner (that means no "guy whining", no cowering, no acting like a little kid that stole cookies) that it was a stupid mistake not to tell, but to be perfectly honest there wasn't anything to tell.  Tell her it wasn't your idea, you didn't stay long, and that you would like to deal with this issue and move on with your lives together.  Don't give her any options to make you explain or apologize any further.  She sounds like she is being ridiculous to me.  My husband has stopped off so many places through the years I would be mad until way after I died if I worried about every one.  My philosophy is this...If you are keeping your man happy and he leaves you/cheats/whatever, there was nothing you could've done to keep him and you've done your best as a woman/wife/significant other, etc., if you are nagging all the time, whining, being a b**ch then don't be surprised, hurt, or feel that you've been done wrong when he does leave/cheat/whatever.  I think your wife needs to take some of the responsibility if she is really afraid that you cheated on her, at a strip club none the less....gross!!!  Ask her also to give you some credit for having more class than to cheat with a stripper!!

2KC467tFaa	The strongest relationships are the ones that have a friendship base. Sure, I've dated guys who weren't my friend to start with. We didn't have much in common at all. We cared about each other, but it wasn't enough. I'm married now, and my husband is my absolute best friend. It's great! We laugh at the same things. We know each other's moods, thoughts, and reactions. He's the first one I want to tell something exciting to. We've taken a few road trips that lasted days. We never argued because even when we started getting frustrated, we would end up laughing about it together. I've also dated a friend when I was in high school. Obviously, it didn't work out, but we still keep in touch. I don't think your friendship will be ruined if you do decide to date him.|`|pTj97rYnaa	I'd would go for it. (:     You guys are already good friends, and you know he likes you.    Good luck!|`|Ank2v7E8aa	go for it.    if this guy has been your friend for so long, he clearly cares about and respects you as a friend first and foremost.    you just have to realize that if you and your friend don't work out, it might be difficult to get back to being just friends.  but that should be a risk you're willing to take because a relationship with a good friend is very gratifying and will make you very very happy. it's worth taking the plunge for.    hope i helped.|`|Xhy6VEzOaa	hhmm this one is a toughie  ive been through this a few times  if you really like him, and think it could work, why not?  you definitely need to talk this over with him  i know this may sound weird, but ask him ( or at least think about) what he would do, or how he would react if you broke up..if you would still be friends..ect  it really helps..  be warned  it probably won't be the same after the break up, and may be awkward  but if he's a true friend, you would go back to being friends eventually  (as long as the break -up isn't too bad)
hEKIs6Slaa	You've only been with him 2 weeks, so I'm not sure if "in the beginning" just refers to the first date?  If he isn't into you after just 2 weeks, move on -- why drag yourself down with this loser?  He plays games.|`|yzFxc5uXaa	hes not that into you, you should dump him before he dumps you, sorry girl
6KpZ2fIRaa	My wife would wonder why I went to this gym rather than one without porn. It would cause problems. And she wouldn't go to a gym like this. She already tries to avoid horny men who want to talk and hook up. This would only make it worse.|`|3iNobwVraa	Some people would be bored and trying to change the channel.  Let them change the channel and keep sweating.    Others would be heading off to the *ahem* locker room 'a duex.'  Let them go in the locker room and keep sweating. ;)     No, I don't think "more amorous" is possible for my spouse.  And, yeah, people might be more likely to cheat in this environment.  Married couples should prob work out together at this gym...actually, that's a benefit too, in multiple ways.  Well, I must say, I'm liking this idea more and more...you might be onto something here.  I wonder, though, do you think people would be trying to hide their cars so the neighbors don't see them going to 'that' gym?  :)  Gotta love gossipy do-gooders! They're always were you least expect them!!|`|izbAdDUraa	I dont think it would be a success. I would not find it motivating to be running on a tread mill alongside some dude with a giant ***** or worse, wonder who has ****** off on the weight bench i am sitting on!  Gross.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Gross.    I wouldn't go to a place like that.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I would think people would end their work outs early and get fat (and laid)..... Laid first, then fat, because of lack of exercise.|`|4HoVVCenaa	After five minutes, I would be bored to tears. What might work better is videos of very fit women and men working out, with no clothes...
7BJ0YScwaa	They're not teasing you, you just don't get it. They're testing you to see how you react. They want to know if you're a loser or not. They can't determine that right away, you could be hiding it. So they push to see how you react and if you react in a way that confirms you're a loser she will lose interest and find another guy who reacts better.  People want something better. Something they can't have. You do too or you wouldn't ask about this. I'm sure you could take home a fat girl ant time you want, but that's not what you want. You want something better. So does she. Don't get angry with her for doing the same thing you do. If she says "I like to f***" and you go red or studder etc., she knows she's got you. She knows just like you know you've got that fat girl. And thenn you're not interesting anymore because she can have you. You are too easy. Change your attitude and you'll be taking her home with her sister if you want.   Man up, show her that her "teasing" doesn't effect you. Don't let her control the situation. Don't show her she can manipulate you. If she says "I love a guy who can give a good massage" you don't give her a massage. You say "So do I. Women aren't strong enough to really go deep into the tissue..." yada yada and get her to massage you. Control the situation instead of complaining about it online like a woman. Just think about how women behave and do the opposite.|`|AA10743159	Many women have self esteem issues, especially when it comes to their body. So one way they have to see if they have "It" is to tease guys. If it turns them on, it boosts their self esteem.  For them it's like scoring points. I don't really think, they care or even wonder what it is doing to the guy, they are teasing. Of course many do, and love the fact, that they can drive a guy crazy.  But lets be honest, how hard is it to turn we men on, lol. If the girl is cute, and curvy, she's already three quarters of the way there.  If she isn't cute etc, then I doubt her teasing will have much effect.|`|BZzarKRSaa	okay i do that all the time, don't feel bad it's just a joke like kidding and also it gets the girl closer to the guy, i mean we know it's not that attractive but it's like asking why do you put your arm around some girls shoulder|`|rKFspUFvaa	she probably just liked the guy|`|Tq8693rdaa	I do not think women tease to hurt anyone's feelings.  teasing depends on a persons personality. some girls like the attention.   there are also girls who tease without knowing that they do tease men/guys.   teasing doesnt define a person, for some, its just a way of getting attention or having fun.  we are just hard to read.|`|GuagOB2jaa	im definatly pickin up what your puttin down.. ive been in a ralationship for over a year and she still does it to me! guess its just to keep us on our toes!
1OxiOk2taa	When old friends grow up often things change causing them to drift apart. Right now what you need to do as a best friend is sit down and have a heart to heart talk with your best friend. Also remember not to be jelous if she hangs out with other people also. Maybe you can join yourself in their conversation or make some friends in your home room. Just remember nothing is wrong with your friend- it is the process of becoming a teenager. Good luck!
VXaKIFVLaa	it really doesnt sound like it it sounds like he just wants a friend with privileges because i dont think if he did like you he would have done that but that is just me|`|4oyDKNHAaa	he most probably likes you, the question is do you like him back
piDDZ6Ywaa	Punch him back! What a Cheeky b*tch. This stupid Polish dude in my school kept on slapping me at the back of my head so l just grabbed his hair and pushed him away. He didn't even lay a finger on me since. Stick to your guns ;)|`|diLyYs0Zaa	A friend ship with you i guess. good luckon fing out what he wants|`|JFKPqQV1aa	If he's like me, then he's doing it as a joke, a sign of endearment, or a symbol that he wants to get on more informal terms with you. If you want him to stop then pull him to the side and then ask him (Nicely!) if he could stop, because it hurts you.|`|15073763f113bb4b83e773ec7503cfddaa	he definitely likes u...try talking to him when u get a chance =)|`|uP7qH47laa	Im guessing if your in college your what 16-17-18? and well if he hasn't gotten over the " You smell of poo!! ... i like you..." Phase he sounds like a very childish person who can't make contact without reverting to a child like state... sounds like a bit of a twat punching a girl as well IMO anyway|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	Maybe we want to get to know you and this is his way of showing you!|`|dDDAbqqhaa	he wants to **** your *** and **** your *****, and would like you to **** his **** and *** all over your ****, then proceed to **** each others ***** before getting ******* by his big black **** again.

He doesn't have to know you well to like you.  You are a beautiful young lady and that is all a guy needs- he is attracted to you!  Typical boy, he resorts to basic instincts.  Hopefully he won't hit you over the head and drag you to his cave...|`|AlCfnJKYaa	He fancies you and doesn't know how to make physical contact in a more gentle way without risking embarassment/rejection.|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	Maybe he does like you but he's certainly got a weird way of showing it. Punching is male dominance so don't even trust the guy. If he respects women he certainly wouldn't do that so it's a relationship that you could regret even starting.|`|XvG97CTPaa	Honestly, I'm not trying to sound mean, but it sounds like he might have a mental problem of some kind.  I grew up around people with mental and emotional disorders because my sister has some. Many of her male friends would do things like this. Sometimes people are not very good at recognizing personal boundaries.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	He likes you|`|8uIfskigaa	He fancies you is a caveman technique of getting your attention am guessing...... :)|`|KZMwGA2Qaa	he likes you     edit: and he like the way u look|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	Maybe it is his way of saying HI! And he is desperate to get your attention!  Some ppl have such a kind of attitude.You do not need to bother about them and probably he'll stop doing "thing".  Or it seems like he is just trying to be friends.I know but this sounds crazy.Just keep away =]
lyhnHhuWaa	Call the mortgage company and explain your situation.  Ask if they can work with you for a few months... maybe letting you pay interest only for a few months or so.  They may not go for it but many mortgage companies will, especially given today's economic climate.  They don't want to foreclose on your home any more than you want them to.    Next, both you and hubby will need to be willing to suck it up a little and do jobs that may not be in your preferred field.  At least until he's able to land a new job in his field.  You're right that unemployment won't cover everything.  But, if both of you find a way to work two or three lower paying jobs you can make enough to keep the mortgage up until something better comes along.  I know it doesn't sound ideal, but it works.      Cut expenses wherever you can.  Buy the least expensive grocery items you can, even if you don't want to.  You'll get sick of ramen noodles and mac & cheese, but you won't starve to death.  Turn off the cell phones if you have them.  Cut the internet service back to the bare minimum or get rid of it altogether.  Keep the thermostat lower to reduce energy bills.  Sell whatever you don't need on eBay or a garage sale to get some extra income.  Get crazy about it.    It's all inconvenient as heck and isn't fun to deal with, but it is possible to survive a layoff.    ETA - I just noticed your follow up post.  If you're paying for daycare for your four year old, drop it.  That will save you tons.  You and your husband can work it out so that you're working opposite shifts to have someone home to care for your child.  If this isn't possible, work with friends and family to setup sitters for him.  Offer to trade out sitting time.  You can sit for them over a weekend here and there to make up for their sitting your child some.  Don't buy clothes for your child anywhere but the thrift store.  Trust me, four year olds really don't care where the clothes come from.  Yes, kids do cause our cost of living to go up a little but it doesn't have to be astronomical.  They don't really get expensive until they reach the teen years.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	that's the risk of buying on credit,a lot of people never look at the bad things that might happen further down the road and sacrifice a quick payoff when they have a good income and instead opt for a newer car or some other thing.i am sorry you are in your position.and don't feel alone millions are in the same mess.i happen to own my home and to most people its a dump.but i know i wont be thrown out of it.soon some of the people who have said i should do better will be worse off than me,and i would be willing to let then camp in my yared.have tou ever seen that movie grapes of rath?i lived through a couple depressions one in the 40:s and one in the 50:s. and i think this one is going to be the worst of any we have ever had in this country.the best thing you can do is forget about the house and get some kind of shelter that you can easily relocate.such as a travel trailer that way at least you can have a plase to live,remember all most every thing you are acustom to will be a thing of the past for some time,get a small motorcycle and a couple bycycles and make sure you can cook any where a small wood burning cook stove will realy be the thing to have they work all the time.and get a couple guns to be able to keep what you have.|`|dVlLahozaa	Any job would be helpful because unemployment helps very little don't disparate things will eventually get better.|`|iKORI8CCaa	These are tough times.  I don't think there are any easy answers, or answers at all.  I work in construction and have faced layoffs at various times in my career.

MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|4c988b1f1dbba6558aaf1b4303565c38aa	AMEN GIRL.  my hubby just found out 3 days ago that he has no job waiting for him after he was off for 1 yr due to a work related injury. It's BS!  Since the Dr. released him back to work w/ no restrictions, he's not protected by workmans comp. We are freaking out right now. My wages along will barely cover the house & car payment, and I do not have insurance thru my job.  They paid him his unused vacation which covers the next months bills & he's online every day looking for work.  Worst case scenario, we may have break into our retirement accounts & take the tax hit to survive. God Bless you & everyone else in our situation.|`|pV8oOns7aa	Rent a part or full house move to small one or a very cheep type.    pay the mortgage with the rent.    If it covers.|`|kZ83nGsmaa	So you mean to tell me that even though you don't have any cc bills that you can't afford your home?  If you guys pool your money together each month and there isn't enough to afford your basic bills, then you are living beyond your means and if you lose your house you technically deserved it.  People like myself will come along, snatch it up for pennies on the dollar and make money on it.     I bet if you 2 cut back on everything and lived on the bare essentials, you could get by.  Try it.|`|rYWP5j2Iaa	The best way to handle it is to take care of the  necessities and nothing else just live on bare bones.  look at your finances closely and see what you can cut out.  if there is a deficit then talk to the bank and see if they will work with you about possible options.  there are programs out there depending on the mortgage company.|`|6cm6MB66aa	Ill bet you was a Bush supporter . Kind of late to worry about it now . Tell you the truth not anyone going to worry about you either . People that are working have no idea about whats going on . Ive been going through it for the last 4 years in michigan and im sure back then you or your husband gave a good crap or even thought about it . Same going to happen to you . United We Stand Divided We Fall .|`|8ddChDtzaa	Kris....I feel your pain.  My husband had to quit working because his doctor took him off work because he has to have 4 surgeries this year due to nerve damage in his arms and neck.  I have no idea when he will be able to work again.  Plus he will have to find a job that requires no physical labor.  Things are tight for us too with just 1 salary coming in.  At the moment we are still able to get the bills paid, but I am not sure for how long.  We stopped going out to dinner and going to movies to cut costs.  We are cutting back where ever we can.  Good luck to you and your family.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Well, technically you do not "own" your own home until it is paid for in full.    The bank owns it.    This is the reason there are so many foreclosures right now.    Many people losing their jobs.....|`|dRj9FoHzaa	I assume by asking this it means you have no saving.  First, house mortgage is priority one.  Making sure payment can be met.  Cut all none essential expense.  Keep your phone since you need it for job hunting, but switch to cheaper package with cable, internet or simply cancel them.  Go to public library for Internet and borrow movie DVD from library for entertainment.   Saving water, electricity and heating.      Do not take out a new loan if possible and do not borrow money from anyone if possible.|`|vFCva8R5aa	They don't pay the mortgage when they have no job.     That is why the foreclosure rate is so high and i am terrified of the same thing happening to my family,     All i can say is tell him to get a job (any job even if it at McDonald's) to get the bills paid.    Aww don't worry Val, i showed you some love with a thumbs up! What you wrote is completly true!|`|Hky3sGeZaa	If you can get a loan on your income that might be where to start.  You might want to let your mortgage holder know that things are tight now. Hope your husband finds something soon.
PH7bSwytaa	ditch jeremy. He doesn't seem like he'd be that great of a boyfriend if he treats yoou like that, right ? Just, go for scott. make everyone think yoou like scott, and then if jeremy starts acting normal again, he obviously either liked yoou, or was nervous about the fact that yoou liked him.   hope this helped, goood luck. =)|`|ZjpVlm9Gaa	Leave Jeremy. If he can't treat you like a woman, then you shouldn't like him. Try Scott instead but make sure not to get in a riff with your bff.     Retarded is not a very nice word.

This is complicated. In elementary when a boy likes you he pulls your pig tails. In middle school he burps in your face. It is normal. If you like someone else, Jeremy will not be able to burp. Don't do this to him.|`|UCxgUaxUaa	I'd say that this is a bit odd. Boys are just weird like that most of the time. Not too sure that i would go straight for the 'he likes me' theory, no matter if this is often how they show it at your age. They actually act that way normally too, so you will NEVER KNOW!! It is sort of up to you, but just try not to do anything too drastic (i.e. loose a friend, make a fool out of yourself, etc.). Sorry if that's not very helpful...    BTW, my friend stephanie would like to interject something: "You are too young to know what true love is. You should be enjoying life as a young person. Stay away from becoming a statistic, for you are at the prime age for becoming pregnant and contracting an STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease). Take care and be true to yourself. I have spoken."    so says the wise and all knowing stephanie...thank you for that inspiring sentiment.|`|Cqe1uWtbaa	i think he likes you, just ask him|`|QrlfIZ5Iaa	Okay Okay..My sister is in 6th grade with the same problem.

Just ask him in text or something if he does.|`|FkE5ORinaa	either hes trying to give you signs that he just wants to be friends or he likes you and doesnt know how to react around you, cuz when guys at young age usually can't think when there around a girl they like.|`|aXljp31xaa	ok who ever you are! he likes you in sixth grade guys want to make you feel bad cause they think thats flirtying! if you dont lik him then ignore him dont give the time of day with his insults or mean comments hell get it and wont see you are intrested in him or wat he is saying! talk tot the other guy! who cares wat your friend thinks i mean ask her first! she obviously not that much of a friend if she wont let you! and........ if the other guy that u do lik bails on you u always have the fist guy as a back up! brillant i kno
HYOQfHbWaa	Just take it easy. Don't think to yourself that what happened is a big deal or embarrassing then it won't be. Just don't have any regrets about what happened during the presentation. Everything will be fine. Don't care too much about what impressions you are giving to others. Even in that situation you noticed that there were 5 people who laughed! Just have faith, it was a little thing. The more you will focus on it, the bigger deal it would become. Rather, cleverly you can use a situation like this to make the guy take care of you.|`|hCIAD98Zaa	Dear , don't stop yourself from crying,it's good to leave your emotions out instead of absorbing it.Like that, you'll get 10 times better .    I think you should explain to others infront of the class that you had an allergic reaction and then like that,they would think you had an allergic reaction and not that you were insanely nervous .    So if you do that , you would get better . But I assure you , you should leave that in the past and everything will be okay if they did laugh why not just ignore or else you'll always think of it for a long time.Everyone gets their bad moments and no way we can't prevent them .

rOxdhG85aa	i did something similar a year ago and i can say this with experience.  i think he doesnt like u, hes jus a bit cautious and sensative.    however, if hes not over u, its a different story. the fact that u havent talked in person for a while is hard to say bcos u can then be able to see if he blushes, or stares at u etc,    if u need any advice let me know|`|goP5E0Kxaa	I knew top of the line, beautiful, confident women that crushed over me for years in high school and I was so shy I never completed the cycle for them but they kept cycling on for years.    Don't put yourself through that , ask him if he would like to hang out with you some time, as a friend . See how he responds.|`|xDqAmdBkaa	I was really shy and really like this girl but we never really talked cos i was so shy and got nervous, but then when she started talking to me it was easier for me to talk, so if you talk to him and take the lead in the converstion he might talk to you more and you'll be able to judge how he feels about you better. Then i found out the girl fancied me too and that made it alot easier too, so if you tell him how you feel he might be less shy. Also ask him out, cos even though i knew this girl liked me i was scared to ask her out. Now though we've being going out with each other for nearly 7 months. Also if you make him feel like you really like him he'll talk more and not be as shy.|`|NJK2ypmsaa	I unfortunately have bad news... I don't think he likes you.

There is nothing worse than excuses.  I have been turned down more times than I'd like to admit, and there's a HUGE difference between a girl giving an excuse and just saying "you're not my type" or "I don't see you in that way" or whatever.

That way, you don't have to go out with him and he won't be crushed.  Or, if you'd rather, tell him you already have a boyfriend. ^^|`|DxS5CbG6aa	just tell him you can't or something... don't listen to those idiots saying "say your a lesbian" and stuff like that... because word will get around that you said that and BANG next thing you know - no guys will ever wanna be with you because they will think that you really are one|`|NAvaa1Araa	Just tell him you don't like him like that, but that you could still be friends. (Only if you want though.) Good luck!|`|8ISZEKm7aa	i'm sorry i wont be good for you if i get with you your going to be more hurt than me saying no rite now.|`|CyHJlCZXaa	I wouldn't say you're not looking for a relationship right now, because if you do end up in one sometime soon it will make you look quite bad. Would it not be better to tell the truth?    or you could say "I'm sorry, but i see you more as a friend."|`|tQZoUsKtaa	Why make excuses? just say, thanks for the invitation but i am not interested.   Be direct and don't play games. He will have more respect for you and move on. Just giving excuses will have him asking you out again and again.
AGbusTqGaa	Have you ever addressed these issues with her before?  If you have never told her that you think her behavior is a little over the top and annoying then she won't understand why you're blowing her off and probably try harder to hang out with you.  The mature thing to do is to sit her down and tell her how you're feeling.  Maybe she doesn't notice she's acting this way, and she surely doesn't know that it bothers you if you've never told her.
ab67549a4ed164ffd53d6af3dbd65456aa	email her, text her and then talk to her. it will be easier. dont worry, it'll be fine. she probably wantrs to talk to you too but is shy. soemone will HAVE to do somethign or you will loose her to some other guy who will get there first. You won't like that will you so go and do it tomorrow quick and fast. Just say hi and smile at her. If she is sitting in lunch room, ask if you could join her etc.|`|08y217Rdaa	You will chicken out if you don't know what to tell her. So make up your story and help her spend the time. Amusingly.|`|AO6CKCzHaa	Why don't you try accidentally bumping into her and see where things go from there. She will either realise how nice you are and you will start talking or she will ignore you. If this happens then you can just forget about her until you get your next crush. At least you can say you tried.
vLAGnmGEaa	They didn't make it up.. Your ex doesn't want to give you any satisfaction. He wants you to think he's happy with her.|`|NWtNz7p4aa	I am sure he told his friends that. He just didnt want to admit it to you because he wants you to think he is happy without you.|`|1ujfKqqYaa	well, his friends were either lying to get you excited or else, (this is most likely the case) he just said he didnt say it so that it didnt look like he was having problems, most people dont want their exs to know that their relationships arent good!|`|QgnuaD6daa	maybe the guy is lying|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Just to piss u off...|`|O2fXBvB2aa	if they didn't like you they were probably just being mean and said it to get you hopes up.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	It doesn't sound like they were making things up.  I am guessing that he said that because he either does not want to get back with you or is a chicken.  Either way, someone is lying.  The friends have no reason to lie.  I wouldn't get back with if I were you until I was sure he wasn't playing games.|`|MOqLx1FRaa	mayb because they dont like you.....its called false hope|`|e98RKB35aa	It sounds like to me that his friends are trying to stir some kind of pot by making you mad at him. Friends do that and I think it is childish but it happens.|`|6oMF0EIpaa	more then likely they arent...|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Move on and forget it all.|`|J16sR7gtaa	to get you to dump him and maby take over his spot..men are ruthless enough to screw over freinds for a woman......|`|Xhy6VEzOaa	the is probably the one lying b/c he probably stilll likes you  either that, or his friends are just fooling around..(do they do that a lot? if they don't they probably aren't lying)
lUyNM5uiaa	maybe she just looks at you like a little brother or little toy?  i know this is rude but i know a kid named josh and he's in 8th grade and i flirted w/ him over text but he gets REALLY annoying so i don't text back anymore...  maybe thats why?  (im older than he is too)
FUMggMIPaa	i say no if he doesnt believe you when your tellin the truth then how can u keep an honest relationship if he wont even listen to the truth
f5u9sxbTaa	well, you love him?  Love is forgiving.  There's your answer.
15073763f113bb4b83e773ec7503cfddaa	have u tried just talking to her about it? like i kno it sounds lame and i kno its just so much easier to get in someones face and cuss them out, believe me im such a ***** like that, but the truth is you do get farther by just trying to talk it out. if that doesnt work then you should definitely just try to stay away from her as much as possible and as for the bus...if its possible switch. i had an issue just like this with a ****** on my bus and i switched and just flip her the bird out the window =)  hope i helped!|`|K5TfhK5Raa	violence or rudeness is never the answer so just tell her straight up what u think. but say it as nice as u can. or just never talk to her and i mean never and she will think u aren't friends since u screamed at her. hope i could help ???
K8OjmMUAaa	Some people like to act hardcore with the keyboard, and hide behind the computer. Sometimes they're just *******...take your pick really.     What was the question, anyway? If it was a sensitive topic then you're bound to get some judgmental pricks thinking they know better or just ARE better than you. You can pretty much decide for yourself what answers to ignore, and which to take seriously.     Personally, I might not always be all sugar and spice in my answers, but I do tell the truth...I just try not to be unneccesarily rude.|`|Gv71dW0oaa	Don't let goofy people get the best of you.|`|NGKwsawdaa	People are just a$$holes sometimes. Don't let it bother you and don't take it personal. If it really does bother you then just don't post any more questions, because you're are always getting to get that one idiotic rude answer.|`|4biGrjPkaa	Some people are  just idiots. Report her. YA will act on it.|`|evW18jvIaa	Some people just never grow out of being jerks.|`|QIwhMrBraa	one could say its you who cannot handle being in the playground. sorry to enlighten but YA is notorious for cheeky responses. if you cannot take the heat, get out of the sauna.    i myself find these crybabies who report people quite irritating and ive suggested to YA to remove this option, ha only joking calm down|`|99cb7ed23f0df048795281980a96543baa	You put questions up in an anonymous forum where people have no social obligations to be polite.  Some people ask total asinine questions, and bring the abuse on themselves.  Some people just use the anonymity in order to say things they wouldn't DARE say to someone's face.    Best thing you can do is to block and ignore the abusive people.|`|LqS60B3Baa	What was your question ?|`|Zgs4RncIaa	That is EXACTLY what i'm talking about!!!    Some people (not all) are so rude on here it's a little sickening!    I admit to being rude to the "dumb" questions, but what do they expect?    But when someone has a serious problem or question, why can't those that don't have anything nice to say just keep it to themselves?|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	The anonymous nature of Y/A and other forums gives some people the feeling that they can say whatever nasty thing they want.  Just because we don't know who each other is, doesn't mean we shouldn't treat each other with respect.  It doesn't mean we'll always agree with each other, we might even call each other on things, but we can always do it in a respectful way.  They are not worth a second thought.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Some people are immature, the only thing you can do is report them, hope other people report them and move on.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Listen, you can't please everyone all of the time, even the most innocent question here can get the nastiest of answers. Simply click on 'report' if it really bothers you.    My advice, get over it and move on. There is no point in getting upset about somebody who doesn't really know about your situation and the people in it.|`|AA12379904	Better to block them than report them.|`|QSodlfMraa	report her and they will deduct 5 points from her.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Just report and move on, no reason to let people get to you.|`|AA11704353	Ignore those stupid answers it happens to everyone... Its people who just decide to act retarded and are unable to answer a question!|`|hWuS3AlLaa	This question does not belong in this catagory.   You are violating the T.O.S. by calling out other participants.   I read her answer, while she could have left off the last word in her advice she was not abusive.     Make sure you block me too, that is what you seem to do to anyone that does not jump on your bandwagon of hatred towards your step daughter.|`|o1yy6KABaa	some people dont like honest opinions and cant handle it.  Block her, and report her answer.   If you post further questions about her AND use her name you will only make her react more.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I guess you report them and block them. Not much else you can do.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Oh boohoo! Its Yahoo. If you can't take the Yahoo heat, then I feel really, really sorry for you. How do you deal in real life, if you can't deal here?|`|2mqrbxN1aa	I asked an innocent question on here a few weeks ago and i was abused and told to f off, so i replied to one of her questions and said what i thought of her smoking whilst pregnant.  She then asked another question regards my comments to her and they all gave her sympathy.  My abuse was good and i am proud i really got to her because all the other Y/A could not reAD AND UNDERSTAND THAT SHE ABUSED ME FIRST  report the stupid troll and i have blocked that I AM A TROLL too!  he is a stupid twat x  ignore em babes x    Janet what was your question - i shall answer in your favour x

Reasonably attractive, takes good care of himself, doesn't dress like a New Jersey guido, use hair gel, or cloak himself in excessive amounts of cologne. Smart, able to hold an intelligent conversation about something other than cars or sports. Appears to take an interest in my life and activities. Does not have obvious anger issues,emotional baggage, or bring up ex-girlfriends on the first date. Treats waitresses,service people, and animals with respect and kindness.    If he also happens to be super hot and have really good taste in music, well then I'm in love!|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	A sense of humorrr.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Attraction/Physical Chemistry  Treats you well  Most girls appreciate humor and honesty  Things in common to bond over|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	He has to be approachable, sweet, friendly, easygoing, well-mannered, cute, romantic, confident, independent, polite, understanding, sensitive to a degree, smart, and sort of a flirt lol.
98798396ccedb15932700406233deb82aa	ok look. A girl likes a guy with some balls. She has shown you all the signs of her liking you and she is waiting for you to show some signs back or to flat out tell her. So... just tell her! As you get older tho, it becomes less and less "I like you" , "I like you too" and more that you both just sorta "know" after a certain amount of time. But if it makes you feel better to have that "exchange of liking vows" then go for it but i don't think it makes a difference at this point if you or her actually says "I like you"    but yea... most girls want a MAN, not a boy who asks what he should do on yahoo answers. ;]|`|VZPtCkweaa	she's waiting for you to say it first|`|3c667616505d90697f49712e96eb1e58aa	i think you should wait a little while, see if she continues to act this way. if she does she definately likes you, those are like the biggest signs. basically smiling alot and compliments.|`|oPKpGFobaa	If you think she does, then just tell her, bro  The longer you wait, the more you're going to wish you said it sooner.  And if she doesn't, so what? It's not going to "ruin your friendship" the way most people say it will.|`|Xhy6VEzOaa	yeah go ahead why not  she's made it pretty obvious she has feelings for you  so talk to her about it..or maybe make a move if you really want
F47MyGDSaa	You (or the older sibling) would need to go to court and get adoption/foster papers filled out, and the younger siblings parents would have to sign them.
qYPWKv6Faa	why go back? keep it moving.......if he broke up with you and you both teased each other then you shouldn't want him back he sounds weak to me|`|TMi1GhSHaa	tell him you were just joking around and then flirt with him in a happy flirting girly cutsey manner.|`|3Rq86sYYaa	omg the same thing happen to me lol. just like stare at him and like laugh and like touch him when u talk to him and send him signs that u like him.|`|p52TIrgUaa	ummm.............. be nice!!!!! that might be a place to start|`|PuD7HUnRaa	Be nice.
DxS5CbG6aa	shut up dumbass fake posting dork|`|bC5XeVEIaa	First of all, we don't know anything about either guy. Second of all, I hope they come to their senses, as you are clearly conceited and only want a boy toy, not a boyfriend.|`|dac26bdff4c1ae6e6c1c4dbb89df4ac1aa	pick a guy that is nice to you,acts like a gentleman and likes you for you|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Neither, pick me.  Im stunningly handsome.
911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	in what context?  exams? love? marriage /train fares, expenses etc   overall its not a good idea  and often has  nasty repercussions unless you are an MP then You can cheat all You want.|`|bc34ec59002a028af03455eb88fd84ebaa	its not acceptable, but u got to accept the fact that it happens/people do it and then move on.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Maybe to you , or him, but you will always be called a cheater if you are one .|`|EPaYoJaiaa	nope, no way, never, not in a million years, negative, no|`|TMi1GhSHaa	its NEVER acceptable.. but it can be forgivable.. depends how far they went with the "other" girl.|`|Gb7DqxRLaa	Um NO! Would you like to be cheated on?|`|VUNfI7yBaa	NEVER EVER ACCEPTABLE|`|AA11263103	No.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	no. all the excuses are wimpy anyways.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	No, If you aren't satisfied with the person you're with then get rid of them; but don't cheat on them and not tell them.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	i think it is never acceptable. if you ever consider cheating on your gf/bf then you should just break up with them. cheating is not right at all.|`|vnKO3h4Jaa	nope anyone who cheats is dirty scumb in between my toes and should see how it feels themselves. if you think its ok go live in some poop :)|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	I've been cheated on twice by two women. Both for petty reasons. I cannot imagine a "good" reason to cheat on a person. Even if your partner cheated on you, two wrongs don't make a right. I think cheating is one of the lowest things a person can do. Never acceptable.|`|nci2WOYXaa	I'm going to say yes but only in those extreme circumstances where someone does something so horredously awful to you that you want to get them back.|`|SRZza0cWaa	No.. NEVER..!!|`|BGVqTSXXaa	i think so - i cheat all the time but shhhhh - dont tell anyone lol|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, cheating is never, ever acceptable. It is as simple as that.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	yes, life cheats you, and you accept it|`|80KFJGMZaa	Never. Never do it, never let someone do it to you.|`|qLJnCj0Naa	Hell no!   nah  no!|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	NO! why would you cheat. just break up with the person your with if you want to "explore".|`|NBnexoYDaa	um, i'm gonna say not intentionally. i guess if you black out there's not much you can do, but, then again is that really acceptable?|`|4dXcZhuTaa	no, never, and it is not forgivable.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Shouldn't be, and No!    Not good to do things like that behind your mates back...    the worst thing in the world for your bf to screw or doing stuff with someone else when he has a gf. why have a gf then?|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	no      its horrible =[|`|7jDyJRLyaa	Never|`|kiJUCYMcaa	no|`|ab67549a4ed164ffd53d6af3dbd65456aa	nope. If they were so into you, they wouldn't hav eto look else where. If you were more than enough for them, their eyes should not wander no matter what.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	No there is never a valid reason for violating a person's trust|`|pmkdQKEvaa	imagine you are the other person...no!   unless your talking about cheating in monopoly - totally different i do all the time ^^|`|96ndKQncaa	If You always have eyes for other people in a relationship.  you should have not got into a relationship in the first place.  i am sure you will be punished some ways for your actions if you do not confess your sins and ask for forgiveness.|`|GLHRBWpFaa	That all depends on if you get caught or not lol. but really not dude|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	nope never...if u have feel the urge 2 be with someone else just break it off n b with the other person but dont cheat...caus what goes around will most definately come back around.|`|AA10446613	emmm no! just put urself in the place of the person cheated on! then u'll find out how awful it is|`|AO6CKCzHaa	No there isn't a time where cheating is acceptable. If you or your partner feel the need to cheat then maybe you shouldn't be in a relationship.|`|cc0IPV6Iaa	only if you were forced into an arranged marriage and your can't stand who your with! LOL. Um... I would say it depends on the situation but usually there is a better alternative (ie. breaking up first).|`|5BBy6G36aa	Maybe if you were FORCED to marry somebody and they used you as s sex slave.  Besides that? No way, I hate cheaters.|`|10f20d3a94bbb505d05b6f3bee53b846aa	It never is. If you're not happy with her, leave her.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..NO Jonathan!!!...it's not!......unless of course you are significantly interested in a bleedingly bad life of mucked up bad Karma or something!......are you?|`|IoQhLrhMaa	If you got cheated on firsttt! but then ur supposed to break up..... so NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!|`|8ut0e6BDaa	No No No....sometimes understandable, sometimes forgivable but NEVER acceptable|`|03CZvXGNaa	No, absolutely not. ever.|`|7twWHSJYaa	no, never, don't do it.|`|AA10962675	no its not!
AGbusTqGaa	it sounds like she likes you and wants to get to know you better.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	I'm sure she does have an interest in you, either superficially or monetarily. How could anyone develop a real relationship over the internet? How could you ever believe in an emotional connection without looking into the other person's eyes? I don't get it.|`|gK8Y20btaa	i kinda think it's weird, i guess it all depends on how old you are. if you are older than 18, then it's your life and you should go for it! give her your number what's the least that could happen? if you're younger than 18, go for someone who lives near you. long distance relationships hardly ever work.|`|mqXYh2mTaa	WEll iM A GURL AND i KNO EXACTly WUT SHE WANTS 2 DO.

So with that I'd say that you need to get to know her before you jump to any higher conclusions than friendship. If you live ne'er to her, you could meet in the middle, at a movie theater or something. I've had the same thing happen to me and another guy. And now we're like, best friends.    Good luck!
2KC467tFaa	You have made an excellent choice. Surround yourself with people who are good influences. I commend you for having the right outlook when it comes to sex. It's not something to take lightly. Unfortunately, your friend sounds like me when I was close to that age. It was one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my life. Hopefully she'll learn, but don't feel like it's up to you to teach her.|`|JZUn4y6Gaa	If that is not the direction you want to go with in your life you definitely made the right choice. Birds of a feather flock together or basically as much as you may not want to be influenced by your friends but the more your around them the more you will do things to be accepted by them.|`|3rNI7qt9aa	yeah you did if they treat you like that after you gave her your opinion then she isn't a real friend. She'll end up getting in trouble and then if you don't tell someone you'll be in trouble too.|`|6oMF0EIpaa	Sweetie if you feel in your heart that its wrong the way they live their lives then you made the right choice you dont have to completely kick her out of your life but be distant and if shes a true friend shell find her way back to you you dont need to be influenced in a crowd like that you know whats right from wrong and youre a very smart girl!! Keep your head in school and worry bout boys later down the road youll know when your ready
f5u9sxbTaa	you just say to yourself:  If he is awesome, then my real love must be awesome as hell!|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Cry me a river. Consider yourself lucky that other guys actually validate your existence (feeding your ego, which clearly doesn't need feeding). Be alone for 5 years without so much as a date or a passing glance from the opposite sex, then you can cry to me.
15073763f113bb4b83e773ec7503cfddaa	did u tell anyone what happened? just give them time theyll come around...just keep yourself busy and try not to think about it too much

Good luck dear.|`|epSeMRwsaa	There really are no SIGNS of cheating that will stick out. Unless he is actually cheating of course, and then it's called proof....not signs. If he is actually cheating OR flirting online, it's hard to find that out without like hardcore computer software. Which if you have to go that route, you usually already know deep down that he's cheating.     You say you trust him so I usually suggest not going through their stuff IF you really do trust him. There's no reason and if he finds out you're snooping, it usually pisses them off.     NOW with that said, I've had a few friends who snooped on texts, pockets, etc....and found stuff. Like I said...that's call proof and you handle that however YOU see fit.|`|QIwhMrBraa	he either goes overly affectionate or cold, or both at different times. he leaves the room to use his mobile phone and has a lock on it so you cant spy. you hear his phone has a text message at 1 in the morning when he's with you or if it rings during the evening when hes with u he ignores it or switches it off without a word then disappears ten minutes later for a 'ciggy' outside. his friends that know you act a bit distant cos they may know and they dont want to give it away cos they are loyal to him, not you. he may stop bringing you to places with those friends for fear one of his friends will slip up.    when he's with you, he's not 'with' u. he may drop out for an entire day when he normally texts or rings u frequently, with no reason apart from just been busy. he still stop making effort to have conversations with u, will go silent alot.    he will suddenly want to just lie round and sleep when he's with u rather than make effort to take u out.    he may even act like he is angry with you but u dont know why. this is to try to start a fight so he can go off to his mistress.    best thing to do is ask him if he is, look at him straight in the eyes. if he gets defensive or angry, i would say he's guilty. but the eyes never lie, and if he cant look at you or if he swallows after u ask him or seems nervous, u know the score.    look, most men cheat at some point. its just a cruel fact. if you love him and want to grow old with him, manage him past this and the only way to do that is to walk, and let him chase u and beg u back. if he realises that u will actually leave him if he cheats or keeps cheating and he loves u, he will stop. its like training a dog to stop going round humping people's legs. and if you find out who the girl is, make it crystal clear to her he's off limits from now on, and if she trespasses, she is gonna deal with u and next time u aint gonna be so polite.|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	If you think it - then he might as well be doing it. There is nothing he can do or say that you will believe anyway. If you don't have trust then why have the relationship.

And on that special date each year, we journey back to the spot of our first kiss and reaffirm our love and commitment to each other. It gets no better, or romantic, than that.|`|nG5kgQmDaa	paris|`|AA11263103	Pairs, France|`|05aKFYl5aa	las vegas bellagio water show when they played it with "My heart will go on - Celine Dion"|`|w1pbRmazaa	middle of a snowy field at night with coffee|`|EdidZdtlaa	on a balcony looking at the stars in canada|`|yetGbkdBaa	Wal-Mart|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	Gretafin, Switzerland|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	the bubbly bath|`|5P3cHR4Taa	The annual weenie roast.|`|njxxUBjeaa	Paris, France  and Rome, Italy  Im somewhat italian =]  i loved it!|`|CBgDc1Auaa	It's not always the place that makes it romantic, it's how you treat the situation that makes it romantic...    anywhere I am with a lovely lady is the most romantic place I've ever been!|`|G37z5ldaaa	on a small boat alone with my gf|`|GpwqiafDaa	pairs, or rome, some where far a way so you wont think about anything else................but not for to long cuz then they will miss there other friend or family

q7jzoKmfaa	Wow! I've had depression since my bro passed away when I was 11 & I know what you mean don't worry. I met my husband on myspace I don't tell people that though. I say we met at starbucks its true technically we did. I can't tell my parents either my husband have been together for 4 years now. it doesn't matter how we met or found each other. Just keep saying you met at a park & I'll keep saying my hubby & I met at starbucks no biggie|`|OXNiEDROaa	Yep.  the man I'm with now...the man that I love, I met on a social site.  1 1/2 yrs later, I meet him in person....instant chemistry.  We've been together 10 mos now|`|ptclgKl5aa	I've never considered online dating, but that's because I live in a small town(about 10,000) people, but if I ever lived in a bigger town and did online dating I'd probably want to make up a story about how we met too.|`|f8uXyJcUaa	i think u should be honest about how u met the guy. and if ur  parents  are unhappy because u met someone online, then just tell him how happy  he makes u feel.|`|AA10743159	Why worry about how you two met. It could have been accidental, or by an introduction, by a friend. It's what happens after you meet each other that counts. You may have met him, and it may not have worked out for you.  Like your situation, many people, lead busy lives, and their circles of friends, co workers etc, may be limited.  Meeting people through newspapers, magazines, or what they used to call, "Lonely Hearts Clubs", has been going on for hundreds of years.  So today, it's online dating, and that has been going on for decades, although in a different format.   I wouldn't be shy about telling your parents, how you met, after all they can't be that old fashioned surely. Once they have met your guy, and get to know him, if they haven't already, I'm sure they will agree with you, that it was a great idea.  It isn't how you met, but what happened after you met, that truly counts.  So just count your blessings and be happy to share your good fortune, with your family and friends. If you don't make a big deal of it, neither will they.|`|RVdAXPDRaa	If it's not romantic you picked the wrong guy. Find another on line. Meeting on line is the best way to meet. You can become fairly well before you ever meet in person.Do you think your parents would be happy if you met him in a bar?|`|b82ybE3gaa	I feel the same way, but i found the man i love on the internet as well. Well on myspace, not an actualy dating service, I feel kinda weird saying "oh we met online." Otherwise I would have to say we met in Wal-mart, and thats still not romantic, but the way that I see it is that I am sure not ashamed of him so when people asked i just say i met him on myspace and we started talking and talking and we just clicked.    I still get that feeling that people think its bad, and we aren't going to last. People even say that meeting up online isn't good because you never know if they are really telling the truth, but the way I see it (and I usually have to explain this as well) is that I can walk into a bar, and say I have two houses up north and a ferrari, or even millions of $ in the bank, now how do you know i'm lying or not? Honestly you don't.    So thats my thing, I have never been this happy with anyone and anyone who cannot accept that we love each other, although we didn't do it in the conventional way, can just deal with it or not deal with me.|`|txPmR7Npaa	Dear Allison    It is perfectly ok that you met your guy online.  Last year I had two similar experiences.  The second one almost ended up in marriage.  I still love the girl, but she lives in another continent and the distance increased the problems we were facing.    Honestly, I see another problem though.  You said it.  Your depression.      Let me ask you.  Did you have any real benefit from your current therapy?  Unfortunately most therapists are too expensive and no good for their money.  They prefer to give you drugs than deal with the root of your problem.    You are an athlete, I am sure you are a disciplined person.  You can do very well with the right therapist.  Take a look at http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/ to get some ideas about online therapy.  It is a good solution, especially if you live in a small town.      Google for start online therapy or online therapy sessions.  Check these out but use your intuition.      http://www.proventherapy.com/  http://soultherapynow.com/  http://www.sunrisecounselling.com/index....
IPVpkbsBaa	just invite him over where a lil something sexy and just act like ur so happy being single . aand this guy will be like dang she got it goin on and men cant resist that believe me. just dont give him none or u goin to mess up|`|hCIAD98Zaa	I don't think there is a way to make him ask you out.There's always patience in this kind of situation and luck.If he does ask you out ,it's great but if he doesn't then you just have to forget him .    But you know you can always make the move. I mean if there is low chance of him to ask then you can just do it yourself so that this relationship can still happen . Like that you can be together or you can be heartbroken in valentines day .    Anyways if you want to give him a hint , then just talk to him more or even ask him who is he gonna ask out on valentine's day . That would be a good idea .|`|qW4GDpHsaa	well i read somewhere in a magazine how to get back with your ex or something like that. i think the magazine was the feb/march 09 issue of girls life     anyway i guess flirt with him when you can. on btw why does his guy friend does not want you guys together just wondering     elizabeth|`|KPR0tQtfaa	talking is the best thing to do.|`|AA11706943	Flirt with him, tell him how much you miss him and that you'd do anything to just call him yours again... if a woman ever said that to me there is no way i could resist|`|ZJbVQJrBaa	if he broke up with u hes stupid|`|4ThvQYi9aa	Think about why you broke up in the first place....Focus on that. Chances are if it didn't work the first time, it won't work the second time. (Unless, of course one of you has gone through some sort of borderline traumatic event that shook the core of your being in a such a way that you act, feel, and deal with people entirely different) ...and by that I mean...You are a totally and completely different person from the first time that you dated. MOVE ON!!!|`|AA11891408	the best thing in relationships is not to expect your mate to know what you want. you cannot get what you want by willing it so. if you want him to ask you out just tell him. if you want him to know how to make you happy, you have to let him know how to make you happy.|`|88uIjItaaa	I'll go out with you...|`|rJ7OgRzgaa	the most important answer you are looking for, is with the most important guy...so go to him.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	you are wanting a gift, aren't you??? why does it have to be on or before valentines day?
GfGRj3Y0aa	if you don't remember nothing else in life, please remember what I am about to say.  Guys will and can do what you let them do.  It may seem like some girls are being manipulative, and the might to a point, but they know what they want and what they wont put up with from a man.  then there are some girls who like or want a boy so much that they will do anything for him or anything that he says.  They let that happen and the guy will take full advantage of that.  only the guy know if the girl is gf material or not.  I would say be true to yourself and don't settle for anything.  if he is not treating you the way you want or should be treated, then keep it moving.    Remember:    GUYS WILL AND CAN ONLY DO WHAT YOU LET THEM DO!!|`|dVlLahozaa	every one gets what is coming to them eventually and it just seems like guys like women who take charge. it seems sometimes like they don't want  a gf they want a mother to take care of them.|`|EY2ixfZzaa	opetke could not have said it better! omg is he so right i was once a tenderhearted person but now i am not a ***** but I am a wounded tenderhearted person who will never love again cause too many A@@ men have killed me! and molded me into a tender less person who will never trust a man again! oh i will Fu@@ them i am not that wounded but damn i will never trust them!!!!!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	There is no "men" answer to this.    There is only males vs. Men.    Bitches have one thing going for them.....they scare off males. Either that or they completely dominate them. But it doesn't make them happy.    The nice girls fall for males, thinking that they're Men. They're easily fooled because a tenderhearted female is desperate for male attention (bitches aren't as much).    So the tenderhearts make mistakes. They take up with guys who are only there to use the females sexually.     Now, real Men, have nothing to do with bitches. We're all out looking for the tenderhearts. Unfortunately, enough males using a tenderheart, and she becomes bitchy.     So it's a real chess game.    One thing is for sure....you don't need a to be a ***** to avoid the males. Girls today have no idea what a MAN looks like, how he acts, and what can be expected of him.    We've grown up in a fatherless society (either by absence or by a dominating feminist mother pounding him into the ground). So too many girls today think that Men are either punching bags, or they rebel against the idea and try to find any male they can pour love into as quickly as possible (making up for Daddy).     Either way, males are looking for weak prey. They can smell a girl who is desperate to feel vailidated and loved.    CONFIDENCE is the anti-male spray. Males are intimidated by a confident girl, who is feminine and loving, but also secure in her emotions and understands that commitment comes before sex.     As long as a girl sticks to her guns, there is almost no chance she won't be happily married before 25.     You crowd the field of eligible, MANLY husbands with a bunch of punk males....your chances drop signficantly of finding a worthy mate.    Good Luck!|`|L38M9lrLaa	guys are a holes|`|zM2qII1Oaa	The manipulative ones get played too. They just hide that fact well. Everybody gets there just dues in the end.

I think you will feel better if you know you can balence school and a boy, without cutting class :)  Good luck though!|`|wjBKKL2Zaa	I love the good girls, the ones that read books and things and aren't at party's getting drunk or doing drugs cause im a good guy myself but don't worry, and tell him you really don't want to skip a class. and if he really likes you he wont pressure you to do things you don't want to.|`|p9j5zl4Naa	I wish all girls were good girls.

Don't make it easy after that, just make it a little less harder. lol*&*&*|`|PDYiwb3Raa	It doesn't really matter what guys think because if you change your attitude and be a "bad girl" then you won't like your bf as much as you would with a guy who is kind like you. Don't change for anyone, just let them accept you for who you are.|`|b81H0vlYaa	I was/am a good girl.  Only drank wine once in a while, never touched drugs, was Valedictorian in HS and graduated MagnaCumLaude, Phi Kappa Phi and in Lambda Pi Eta in college.  If I had something better to do, I skipped class.  But, I made sure someone was there to fill me in on what I missed, or it was a really easy class, I never skipped trig :) But, yea, I never went to sociology class!      If you wanna skip (one class) and do something fun with him, go ahead.  If you are a good student, you should recover quickly, but be careful not to make it a habit, unless it is a really easy class that doesn't care about attendance.  If you really don't want to, and feel you need to attend your classes, then tell him no.  He should understand if he is really interested in you.  Ask him if he wants to do something after.  I think if you are interested in him, skipping would really mean something to him, because he knows you are not like that, but that doesn't mean you should do it if you don't think you should, or you don't want to.    My husband now, never had a problem with me being a good girl.  That is why we have been together so long.  Usually guys don't want a party girl to marry, unless they are into drugs themselves and never really matured.

q8lFhmE8aa	See, this is why we date a while, then get married, then live together as husband and wife for a while, then have children. When you do it out of order, things are always way too stressful.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	He is stressed because of having a child and running a business in this crapper of an economy. He isn't trying to be mean probably. I know it makes  you feel bad but all you can do is love him and talk to him about it. Maybe give him a relaxing backrub.     The whole being together but not together makes sense. Quality time is where you actually spend the time conversing and doing an activity together in a loving way.    Just hanging out together means you could be playing on the computer and he is watching tv in the same room. Doesn't mean much and does drive you nuts.    Try getting him to talk to you when you both go to sleep. Just talk about life, dreams, hopes, funny stuff, maybe watch a dirty movie together. Share time. It will help.
QCtb7dIhaa	You're willing to risk an 8 YEAR relationship?!!?    If you make a decision, you better think long and hard about it.
kprKXEOSaa	Well, you asked her out, sounds like a date to me.  Plan to pay, if she insists on going dutch, I guess you take that as a hint.  Good luck!
3Rq86sYYaa	i really think you should like flirt with him and see how he reacts like if he likes it. and if people say u guys are flirting just ignore them and in there heads they'll be like na they've known each other for a long time... but ya go for it and if u think he likes you back tell him.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Please understand not everyone wants to read Twilight.
tLSiKk36aa	okay hun i know exacllyy how you feel. like i dont know either but ive heard how it just cokes naturally. wait until a perfect time comes and i guess you just look at each other and i think you'll know when the time is right. i havn't madeout with my boyfriend yet but when we were going too he was like kissing me and saying i love you and stuff so i guess thats when you know the time is right. just make sure you know you really like this guy or you would just be pointless.|`|Xrvutzmdaa	just dont use ur tounge|`|VZPtCkweaa	how old are you?|`|2hUUkPWWaa	dependss...   how old r yu ??|`|1vGfcIf1aa	i didnt know either.  but you'll know when the time comes.
DFJ9m4WKaa	When you next see him tell him "I want to talk to you about something" and then sit him down and say "look I know you like me and I like you, but I'm not really comfortable with all this kissing and I would like you to back off". Tell him when you want to be kissed, you'll make the first move.     Just try to make sure that there is nothing else wrong between you two, just that you don't like being kissed so much. Hopefully he'll get the idea and he won't make a stink about it. Which if he does, maybe consider getting a new boyfriend.    PS - *do not* play hard to get. That can be considered a kind of way to flirt. And it will send him the wrong signal, he may even try to kiss you more. Everybody who is telling you to be straight up and clearly communicate is right.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	tell him you dont want to kiss all the time...|`|91c6bKdwaa	1.Why wouldn't you want him to kiss you?  2.Play hard to get|`|8608dafe2b63d8987ce0ea3a2d1cde68aa	Well, stop going over there or make it very clear that's not what you want.    Guys, for the most part, are horn-dogs and are lookin' to get into your pants.  If that's a problem, don't put yourself in a situation where it could happen.|`|pWoxMohbaa	tell him how you feel. playing hard to get like the girl said above will only make him think you like it and he will kiss you more.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Just talk to him about it and tell him exactly how you fell. He'll understand.|`|D3agflP1aa	play hard to get :P and just like play around [push him off the couch or watever]|`|1O9jE4P2aa	Why do you want to stop kissing? More info please and age and how long you have been dating|`|5YEKmHqyaa	If you are uncomfortable with him kissing you all the time you have to be straight up with him.  There really is no other way.  Just mention to him that you don't have to do that all the time you guys hang out.  Either that or you wanna take things slowly.  He should understand and if he doesn't and he gets angry then you shouldn't be with him.  He shouldn't pressure you to do anything.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Tell him that he is kissing you too much and ask him to ease up on it a little. Communicate, that's what relationships need.|`|e98RKB35aa	Just tell him that you don't want to kiss. Just be straight with him. He might think that is what you want to do. Just tell him something else that you want to do.|`|oR9ZODGtaa	Just play hard to get.   Play around with him and when he starts to go into kiss you, run away or something like that. Push him away friendly and just mess with him. lol  That might make him want you even more though..some guys are like that.     Good luck!|`|9VUVT6IRaa	tell him. dont say it in a hurtful way. like dont say, " hey stop kissing me so much it's getting annoying," just turn away if he tries to kiss you dont try to play hard 2 get he'll just think you want more.|`|Fv07tYnKaa	I'm not too sure what the problem is but I'll try to help.  Do you not like kissing him?  Are his parents around and your embarassed to do it with them around?    The best way is to just talk to him.  Tell him how it makes you feel (uncomfortable, embarrassed, etc.) and try to work it out with him.  Tell him that he has to wait until his folks aren't around.  It will make him want you more too and drive him crazy (in a good way).  Listen to what he has to say in response to this, and he may very well get offended.  But just keep your cool and stay firm.  Tell him that's the way it has to be, and if he wants to kiss you, it has to be outside his house.  I'm sure you two can come to an agreement.  Good luck.|`|qTmuOJCwaa	you have to tell him that you are not comfortable kissing at his house and i dont blame you. You just want to be respectful or you  just dont feel like it.
7utWpFwnaa	talking to another guy, flirting with another guy, if you have msn, aim or similar, change your name to something related to someone else and how you miss them etc...it doesn't have to be true but it always makes him wonder! And if you're gonna spend time making him jealous, perhaps you could hint and give him a nudge to ask you out...or get to know you more|`|rn2chc2taa	well making him jealous never ever works you could just ask him out or wait
RBxIBSKUaa	Sometimes it's really hard to talk to a guy after sleeping with him. It sounds like he really wants you back, so it seems safe to say that you can talk to him about your relationship. Make sure that if you choose to talk to him, you're subtle. Guys can feel VERY overwhelmed when a girl brings up sex, ecspecially after you guys broke up. Make sure you tell him you are willing to slow down the relationship if that's what makes him comfortable. As long as you think about your word choices, he should be open to conversing with you :) Beleive me, talking to him WILL help you get back together with him. If you can't talk to eachother, there is no use being involved with him. Good Luck, XOXO|`|EdidZdtlaa	talk to him about the sex thing and make sure you guys arent uncomfortable with it. but i think he wants to get back together just give him time|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	I would say patience.|`|Xc9KZ4Fxaa	Back off. If he tries to be affectionate to you remind him that you guys are not going out anymore. If he wants to get back together, he will ask you.|`|lmk66tg7aa	Wow, that sounds terribly confusing. It seems to me that there are a lot of emotions that are flying around and changing all the time. The proper thing to do would be to give it time, but that can be frustrating. It also looks like he just wants a girl to "have fun with" seeing as he is touching you like that before you're even back together. I say let him do the talking, try to feel if he's really sincere, because I honestly don't believe he is. If you do go back with him, try and keep a little physical distance for a while to see what his motives are.
R0kPeJqVaa	all the people who say stupid things like "oh just ask him out" or "tell him to stop doing that", we both know wont work. its not the internet at school, u don't say stupid things like that without consequences. maybe he does like you both it happens, but maybe they're just really good friends. i know that theres a girl at my skool that i hug everytime i see her and shes pretty and nice and all but i dont want to date her. IMO from what i read they seem like just good friends dont be too worried :)|`|SaHt5GXeaa	I think this was really rude. If I was her I would of introduce myself to you. It sounds like he is another guy so don't suet him. He will come to you if he wants something.|`|G9WVYwLDaa	I think he is genuinly I nice guy and very affectanate from what you have told me. I dont think he is a fake at all. It does seem to me that he likes you, because if he didn't he woudn't take one look at you and waist his time smiling at you. There is nothing wrong in asking him out your self, and if he is interested he will be flattered. Some guys are just to shy to ask women out due to rejection. Good luck|`|LLBxpMc7aa	Make him come to you he sounds like he's either gay or a flirt and he isnt worth your time|`|4db21a1dbe473540858a4a95596fd501aa	PROBALLY JUS WANTS A THREESUM|`|DbH9Nl80aa	Ahh, me and you both sister. Your problem is exactly like mine haha. Why are guys so confusing? Its really annoying and very hard for     s at points. Why cant they be straight forward sometimes, then the guys you don't have feelings for, are always the straightforward ones.It     es me off haha. Well, it seems like you and "Frank" have a really tight relationship. I don't really think he likes likes her yet, but he might have confused feelings for you and her. I think you should kinda watch out for it, and notice how he hugs her if its like your kind of hug. If you don't get anything out of that..then go up and talk to him. Its sometimes really hard for me to confront a guy like that, so I usually do it by text.Its easier, and you wont have to worry about if you cry or if you laugh because he wont hear you.  I suggest you texting him if you keep getting those feelings that he likes both you guys, because texting him and getting the real answers from him will really help. Especially for the fact that he wont be able to see your reaction. Hope I helped. Good luck hun.(:|`|MECUs8dUaa	make the first move either ask him what his deal is or just ask him out yourself...if he does really like you the he'll either tell you whats going on or he'll say yes      just take some initiative|`|L0TyY01qaa	well guys are gonna have alot of friends that are girls...i think he likes you he is just probably afraid of a commentment right now....just give him time or just talk 2 him about it|`|3iJkAevTaa	Well It looks to me as "Frank" may just be a flirt..  I am a boy and we tend to try to flirt with a girl by doing thinks such as hugging or talking to them in a flirting type manor..  I personally think he's a flirt but I can be wrong.|`|LsAjSUv8aa	Ask him f he likes you in that way. Sounds like he seen a girl he hasn't seen in awhile and you were jealous because you weren't involved in the conversation. Just ask him|`|yWDJTMK1aa	say do you want me or her????? or just find someone else and do the same thing in front of him see how he reacts|`|zSqia4eKaa	haha    well my gay frind chris stewart told me that he doesnt like u at all    that just cuz a guy hugs u doesnt mean he likes u    cuz supposedly guys only have one type of hug      unless they are gay|`|fHhE8Eiraa	Most likely, he was trying to make you jealous so you would like him more. He probably likes you and just wants to make sure that you feel the same way. My advice is to just play it cool and hope for the best. :)
7utWpFwnaa	firstly, you don't have to be the prettiest or skinniest for someone to like you =P Maybe he only treats you as a sister, or perhaps he does like you a bit more than just friends. You could ask whether he likes you (as a joke) and see what he says, or you could wait until he gives a clearer signal
H5NVYoNOaa	Dont worry men just go through cycles where they just don't have as much sex drive . And yes the stress can be a part of it to. What you can do is just be more spontaneous and spice things up . It isn't you its just a stage hes in. Do things like role playing and and masturbating in front of him ,and just drop to you're knees and pull out his tallywacker and start sucking it for no reason.|`|N2BAdOXEaa	Stress is a real turnoff, talk to him and see if you can relieve some of his stress. Help him relax some, use your imagination and you can spark his interest again. Don't freak out over it, try not to add to the problem.|`|fkchpcHJaa	man just dump the dude.. and get with me. im like milk il do ur body good
xNYUZZvlaa	Aww... Man. Someone took my answer(: Haha. Jks. Great minds think alike.    And like that person said... Just go with the flow. Just don't think about it when you are kissing someone. It doesn't help if you're think that you're messing up.   Hope it helps.|`|Ti476VHkaa	Play with their tongue  (with your's of course) that'sdefiantlyy a turn on|`|1vGfcIf1aa	slightly bite there lower lip.  and circle your tounge around theres.|`|8608dafe2b63d8987ce0ea3a2d1cde68aa	Just go with the flow.  If you over think it, it'll just mess things up.  Are you there to enjoy the moment, or to get a score on technique?|`|5YEKmHqyaa	I agree with them.  Lip biting.  Not hard but very subtle.|`|n8NzX47Iaa	if you put your hands on the back of a guys neck when making out they love that its not something you can do with your tounge but i do it and guys tell me they love it, i agree with others though go with the flow|`|GeNUriFBaa	lip nibbling|`|b7gDKbTYaa	Lol is this a poll or are u gonna make out ?|`|mo3HQCkYaa	Very slowly, giggle a little bit so its not so quiet.  Sometimes I'll even play and bite his tounge lightly and just smile and say 'i got you.'  Its usually is good if you run your fingers through his hair, or run your hands up and down his chest.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	I always try to do a sensual and soft moan as I am kissing. It's sweet, sexy, and will let the guy know that you are feeling it and are really into the kiss. Also, as  you moan, press your body against his (or hers!) body. have fun! :)
AA11280073	Introduce him to a new girl. Play sports. He is obsessed with her and that's not healthy.|`|SeKR3zncaa	Keep being there for him as talking about it is probably helping out more than you know. But just some suggestions. . .  -sappy music always helps. Try "Dry Your Eyes Mate" by The Streets; "Sway" by The Kooks; "Santa Monica" by Bedouin Soundclash. . .and by sappy music I don't mean love ballads, this is just good stuff that has its roots in rock but is a little softer and just generally good when you;re feeling down.   -plan a girls night lol rent some cheesy sports movies (Remember the Titans, Coach Carter etc) crack open a bucket of ice cream and just spend some time with him  -theres nothing like the rebound to get you back in the game, don't encourage him to go for anything serious but a playful crush can always bring you out of a rut.|`|NDju3p0Raa	strip club, or tell him to go after another girl. idk. he is weird if he cant get over her. he didnt even go out with her. this happens all the time to every1 else in the world. u just hav 2 get over it. its life|`|NV7RV0Njaa	i mean it's over he can move on it's the best thing to do you two should go see a movie do something together to take his mind off of her and if you do dicide to go see a movie make sure it's not a heart broken movie just try to take his mind off it and keep him away rom the girl or other boyfriend trust me it will help alot      you should return the favor and answer one of my questions|`|l2mJxB1Caa	cry a little. at 15, everything seems like the end of the world. i felt that way. it's not over. he needs to get busy. find a hobby. make a big change for the better. lose weight, gain weight, change hairstyle, get contacts, something, anything that will boost confidence. Also, get him into someone else. the feelings that he had for her may not disappear right away but they will fade over time. time is the only medicine.
4Yoif38laa	It didn't make me feel lonely, it made me feel bereft 24/7.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Yup.    But not the most sadness.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	yes is the answer.  and i suspect most human beings have felt the same way at one point in their lives.  the thing is, put it down to experience, don't take it personally, and move on.  life has a lot more to offer i can assure you.  one day you will meet the right person. sure as eggs are eggs.|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Yes!! Very lonely.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Yep. Twice, actually.  And tons and tons of unrequited crushes.     Don't fret.  The fact that I have actually been truly in love more than once gives me hope that it will happen again (and again?)    Have hope!|`|mxtWuadraa	yeah, it was horrible.     i felt awful after that.     you know, you ought to read 'Love after Love' (don't know who it was by, but it's a really good poem.. it talks about reidentifying yourself after heartbreak.. it's very good)    you will get over it though. If she didn't love you back, she obviously wasn't the one! The One is out there somewhere! Believe it boy! lol    I hope you feel better soon. And just remember, it's not you, it's her! We've all been through it!     good luck!! xxx|`|kiJUCYMcaa	yep, loads of time, i mean right now i like this boy and he doesnt like me, but bits sooooo hard to get over him|`|XAw4cJmjaa	I think everyone in this world has liked, loved, or been in love with someone that didn't feel the same. It is a very harsh feeling and one that can hurt for a long long time.|`|GiHOnv54aa	Unfortunately, yes. My boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks before the most romantic day of the year. I'm still madly in love with him and it hurts so much...|`|uRDKKC3Zaa	Hey!  Just know that to have loved is better than to not have loved.  It does really hurt when you are in love with someone who doesn't love you back. the best advice I have for you is to put that energy back into yourself and it will make you more attractive on the inside than u can ever imagine.  The pain will go away once you find "the One" - your soul mate.  I am in the same boat as u.|`|zjNidefBaa	Yeah. I know not a good feeling at all.|`|pIez7GvQaa	Yeah,,, and i still i am...:(   awkward feeling...  im trying forget about it... even hate that person but i cant cos i still love him...|`|QIwhMrBraa	maybe not in love but a crush, many many times and yeah those blokes never knew i existed. makes u feel ugly, and lonely as well.    if you are in a relationship and u feel this way, you have to end it cos the suffering will only get worse as times goes by.    love has to be at least somewhat equal between two people else one is gonna be weak and suffer and the other will be like a puppet master. it aint healthy.    sorry, keep ur chin up u aint alone|`|z5hrgF45aa	Yes my husband, i thought he loves me but he didn't he used me for visa and to show the world he is married. sadly he was having an incest affair with his cousin. sick man he is out of my life
cl6r8cGBaa	i think being small also is cute.. accompanied by how they look and their actions which make them so adorable.|`|838VJJGvaa	Yeah|`|EdidZdtlaa	yea. im not small but people tell me im cute|`|Dt68f5w0aa	yea non small girls can b cute but small girls are really petite so that's y their so cute|`|LLILtn4Naa	yeah; i'm not some tiny little skin and bones girl but people still say im cute|`|pQBjqMkoaa	no.    if your with a tall guy he thinks its cute because your so much shorter    uhhh i dunno it depends on the guy|`|D3agflP1aa	well yeah sure they call them cute cuz they r so petite|`|e98RKB35aa	It is just a saying.|`|AA10614910	what is a non-small girl? Average? Or morbidly obese?|`|cG7z70Vgaa	I could call any height cute. There is a big difference between hot and cute.|`|p52TIrgUaa	yes they can too many people are always looking for a super model and they will never find one unless they become orlando bloom or robert pattinson. not going to happen so yeah non small girls can be cute don't let people make you think that they can't be.|`|w3MziozHaa	Hell yea. Girls can be cute in all shapes, and sizes. Never let anyone tell you different. Right now, I am 5"6, kinda plump, brown skinned with brown eyes, and I am always getting compliments.|`|AA10857451	Yeah of course non small girls are cute.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	Yes they can|`|bLX2eXROaa	YES|`|ZUD25nA3aa	I'm small and no guy has ever said around me that I was cute.. it stinks but really, it's the medium height girls that get the attention lol.|`|J16sR7gtaa	cuteness comes in all shapes and colors.....|`|b7gDKbTYaa	Im not sure i would call a large girl cute but yea everyone has different opinions :]|`|5wdPKphVaa	I am 5'3" and I HATE being called cute! Just for once I would love to be called "statuesque" or "elegant" or "beautiful". But I think short girls are  "cute" and tall girls are "hot", that's just my two cents.|`|4ThvQYi9aa	I'm 5,6" and 130lbs and people still call me cute. I think it has more to do with your face then anything else. If you have big, bright eyes, a small nose, pouty lips or chubby cheaks...chances are people will call you cute!|`|oU1yUxwwaa	cute doesn't have a size or height. cute is just cute...beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|KkcNoJTkaa	No She Can Be Tall And Be As Cute As She Wants To Be...People Shouldn't Judge People Cause How Tall Or Short They Are...|`|BeUi45dKaa	baby girl,i have male friends which means i get to listen to their stories,and all my male friends say its not that small,little or thin girls are the automatically Beautiful or cute or pretty,its just that the small girls are more confident than bigger girls,and they also gave me examples of females who are considered pretty even though they are pretty,girls like queen latifa,jeniffer hudson,these women are big but because of their confidence in themselves they also automatically beautiful.so just know that its all about the confidence.

I'll pretty much talk to guys about anything,  However, don't start off with something ridiculous.  it seems you don't know her well, so ask her questions about herself.

Actually, I would ignore her and see what happens.|`|G1ikqQVuaa	that is strange.    but, girls have this weird way of liking the fact that someone wants them, even if they are online pervs. Take it this way, at least she is not cheating. this is her way of getting attention from a distance

Maybe try and find friends that do give a ***, i know that isn't easy...The point is to bear with it so that your future is good, its all for you!Not going to college isn't necessarily a bad thing. Its not that big of a deal if you don't care about going right now..for one you still got a long time..secondly, people still do really good not going to college! I would say do what ever makes you feel best about you/ your situation! I am always here if you need someone to talk with. I don't know if that helped or not...but.
mINKANlAaa	just be cool about things.     start the conversation with "hey, hows your day going?" or something of that sort    then talk about:    - her hobbies/what she likes to do     -favorite band    -favorite color    -what she wants to be when she is older    -favorite holiday    -what she looks for in a guy--this is if you want to get personal|`|JukGKm2paa	ill tell you what i did  and what he did ok my crush tried making my lough and he got my heart but be four that i started a conversation like this seems like a part of a movie but works  VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV...    *drop your pencil*  you-oh can you get that  girl- sure  you-thx  her - np or something  you -hey your real smart can you teach some   her- sure     well hopefully she saids yes then later you  and her will become good friends then ask her out it takes time thoe  1 or 2 weeks lol =)|`|waAaMKhIaa	Find out about something she likes.

Uj5kuzoJaa	Maybe it all boils down to... you. Apparently what you've been doing isn't working for you. You should ask some of your friends to set you up on a couple blind dates. (Make sure they're good friends who aren't gonna play a joke on you lol). If you have some girl "Friends" ask them what they suggest for you. Maybe make a goal that the next girl that you find attractive, you'll go and strike up a conversation with her. It's time to get active lol. Once you realize the worse they can do is say "no". It will get easier. And don't be discouraged if the first time you ask a girl out she refuses. It only makes you stronger and more wise|`|s78yIb9caa	I'm 17 and i have never had a boyfriend.

Here is one thing that I will always remember that my parents told me.  My parents have always told my that dating is not a game. I agree with this because I see my friends and they always have girl or guy problems, and it is not fun to always see people getting hurt or hurting other people, so take your time. This may sound stupid to some people, but I would rather focus on getting a good education than always fighting with someone that you are probably not going to marry any ways.  So my point is you are only 18 take your time and figure out who you are, what type of person you are, and then focus on finding someone that is right for you. Please don't rush into anything because I have seen a few divorces in my family from rushing into marriage.|`|AA12302228	the trick is, with the girl you fancy act indifferently but not nasty,then apoligise to her later, but not staight away,then later or next day ask her out. you must read her face to see if you have her wondering if SHES done something wrong to you.good luck lad|`|VZPtCkweaa	you be yourself.    you sound like a real sweet guy.|`|hTr1dpTiaa	I'm 18 and never had a boyfriend!!

ixsUWp5Aaa	aww u cute..she needs to   stop teasing u. she might wanna  go wit u  just ask her|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	It sounds like the first girl likes you and used her friend to make it less awkward for her to find out if you are going to prom.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	dude... i did not understand your question... all i got was girl and girl's friend... thats it. add more details... what did she say to you?|`|Ba4dBwWnaa	dont even waste your tiem on someone not worthy... too may fish in the sea if one is too stupid to realize how great of a person you are. their loss...|`|X9F0nTygaa	you're pretty cute.|`|YxLw8Aa0aa	Just talk to her when her friend isn't around, because i can tell that she is into you.|`|N27e2pzkaa	First, what did she say before she left?|`|LLBxpMc7aa	It sounds like she was trying to hook you up with her friend but then they were only joking?     They sound kinda mean and inconsiderate, just move on and go get a girl who cares about you ;)|`|sah7e5Fzaa	dont know girls are very wired|`|jDO9o5aPaa	First off you are cute.....your friend probably likes you and the little incident she did with her friend was just to make conversation. If you start talking to her then she will change the way she act because then she won't have to try so hard to get your attention.|`|NAvaa1Araa	Uh sounds to me like she's giving you hints. *Cough.*|`|HGeN6LqDaa	one of them wants to go to prom with you but is too embarassed to just ask you up front|`|oU1yUxwwaa	Maybe she likes you. or maybe she just is being a real biznitch it can go either way. id go with she really likes you|`|zb6C2SMMaa	hey man i bet she is just treatin u like crap cuz she wants u 2 go with her but she is not the type to act all lovey and that crazy chic stuff. she probably asked her friend to ask you becuase she is probably afraid of rejection. she will come around.|`|9xhkOuuBaa	Yeah, they're immature. It wasn't you. You're cute|`|LsAjSUv8aa	she likes you.|`|L0TyY01qaa	Well with me i never really lik to give an immdeiate answer to a guy but idk thats just me but also she is kinda flirting with you.|`|waAaMKhIaa	I agree with SailorsGirl. Talk to the first girl and maybe ask her to prom. If she doesn't want to go with you she might be nervous or she just might not like you. These girls could also just be flirting or acting silly. We do that sometimes.........|`|280Uz9claa	that is the randomest question i have ever read, lol|`|8ISZEKm7aa	we like the chase but just prepare to go by your self and have fun and if she changes her mind follow your gut not your heart cause if so you might get hurt.|`|d2q7F0q4aa	srry i cant see the picture cuz of some stupid web-blocker thing   but i think the first girl was kinda flirting with you...as a girl i know how "us females" [lol on 'us females'] are and how girls react. some girls hate to be caught flirting/talking to cerain guys around their friends. i know this cuz i dont like being caught flirting around people/friends/family that i know...    P.S. i seem like the first girl in your question...weird but true|`|a1b7c4cf11e20d9d9f24ac54972174dbaa	Sounds like the second girl likes you but she's just too immature to tell you..find somebody else there is nothing worse than an immature person.|`|EXxtV5VUaa	Don't limit yourself to your appearance. I know in high school, it's easy to do, but the longer you do it, the harder it is to "unlearn."  You deserve better than someone who's going to do that to you. Although, you should also remember that in the modern world, it's not up to girls to ask guys to prom. The "something" girl  2 said is actually pretty important, whatever it may have been.  Anyway, be confident! If, when girl number one asked you if you were going to the prom you paused or gave an indefinite answer, she was probably trying to make it less awkward by mentioning her friend.  Sounds to me like girl  1 maybe interested in you. Do you get along with her? If so, she's the girl you ask.  The teasing is a part of relationships in high school, immature as they are. I'd say she's interested, (girl  1, anyway. not sure about  2,) but that's just what I'd say from what you've told me.  Hope that helped!|`|AA10124172	It would appear that one of these girls would like you to ask her to the  Prom. Pick your poison and go for it. They can only say Yes or No. Anyway enjoy your Prom.|`|BeUi45dKaa	some people just have nothing better to do than make other peoples lives miserable
f18oWWxiaa	thats so frickin hot! i dont know where but whooo hooo!
tFbdkxyIaa	he may like you if he started a fight.|`|MyEKw3hgaa	it could be possible...
kOVp9F0oaa	im sorry to say but i don't think there is a chance you can save your friendship|`|9iUiImTVaa	hmm. You should try calling or texting him, and when you finally get in contact with him, you should explain your side you know that maybe you said some things you shouldn't have and tell him why you said the things you did. let him know how you feel and ask him how he feels, if you guys talk about it all, you should be able to work it out.|`|K5TfhK5Raa	u don't need that *****
xDqAmdBkaa	Lads aren't like girls we usually mean what we say, so if we say we dont know if we like you it might mean no. And guys dont normally play hard to get so if he says no it more than likely means no.|`|QxRKQbt4aa	Girl i dont like:  Hey i really like you.  Me:  well i like you too, you're a great friend.  GIDL:  Know i mean, i liiike you..  Me:  Oh, well you know your friendship is what matters to me right now.  A relationship just will not work for me.  I appreciate your coming to me like this, but i am just not ready.|`|0nV3osTbaa	tell her that you like her as a friend
tFbdkxyIaa	you need to let him go. he doesn't sound that nice if he doesn't explain things to you. there are other guys. write down what nice characteristics this guy has and what his flaws are and open yourself to meeting someone who has the nice characteristics.   i think face to face is much better than telephone stuff.  it's not your fault, it's his.  so he should be crying not you. some day you're realize. you're attached to an illusion, not the real guy.|`|JuSRVDRbaa	hes such a dramaqueen and that can be exhausting, try to get him into some medication and see if that helps, if you still dont feel like this is helping, give up, but break up during his down cycle, so he doesnt have the strength to fight back.
LJMGbzrxaa	I try to get them alone, and have a nice conversation.  usually ill keep looking back at them and smiling. :D|`|F0sQ18MKaa	I get shy, sometimes a bit quiet around them.  joke around a lot and try to make them laugh.|`|4ahQSLxSaa	me none|`|SjEa1tRfaa	Sometimes I just talk to her to see if shes interested at all. And sometimes its just best to tell them flat out because you never know what can happen.|`|4oyDKNHAaa	get touchy, give them hugs, just get closer to them|`|OlxVG5eXaa	Let her know I want her.    Flirting is for children. You see something you want, go get it.|`|icgdb9DIaa	Im a girl by the way!!    When he looks at you when your not looking then when you look at him and then he looks away!|`|K7iR5wDBaa	(I'm not a guy but from experience) taking the piss, looking at you a lot, flirting/ play fighting, making effort with you, singling you out ..|`|LDSMk3buaa	Wink or cowboy stance =)|`|4wvm4RBxaa	Whatever it takes them to notice, unless ur guy is shy then u do the move.  Good luck|`|Fe4Eixw6aa	act goofy around them|`|4S6V4sb4aa	I ask her if she want to have some sex,,, Just kidding.. I smile at her alot and try and find reasons to be with her untill i see that she likes me, and then i just ask her out..|`|1FTFCtaNaa	talk to them more. stare at them, ask them out,|`|VWO9tW5eaa	i talk with them a lot, compliment them a lot but in a kind of joking way. i also try and hang out with them, be really nice ect|`|10knD5g0aa	give her more attention, touch her more, or if i feel really daring, i tell her|`|qy07K2k5aa	I will basically follow my natural instincts, like just go with gut feeling on what to do and what to say to her.|`|J16sR7gtaa	after being shunned by wemen years ago......i gave up on that idea of liking them anymore.....
rJ7OgRzgaa	it sounds like he does, hehehe ;)|`|61Wrl89Maa	If he's making a lot of eye contact, he definitely likes you.|`|4gDvfLsIaa	he might like you but is acting really immature, like a 1st grader.  just ask him, whuts up.|`|gWyezAAsaa	He does... slight teasing is alwayz a sign|`|hBcMiZDBaa	yeah. he does.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	Do you like him ?  If so, next time he says something daft say something like :-  "Why don't you just ask me out, you know I like you"  He'll be speechless.  If he was thinking of asking but too shy (true)  He'll ask you soon
Geqb39wxaa	your only in 6th grade so dont rush things..  and dont you want your first  kiss to be a little more special??|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Are your lips broken? Why don't you kiss him?    This is why dating should be saved for high school and up.|`|lYr1zmQeaa	surprise him and kiss him|`|1vGfcIf1aa	oh wow.  your in 6th grade?  wait till health class.|`|VZPtCkweaa	you guys are too young to be kissing|`|cu67LPb0aa	Well you're young so he may just be shy. If he's not ready to kiss you, don't force him. If you really want a kiss, just lean over to him and just give him one. Eventually he'll get comfortable doing it.|`|cdBRWbTUaa	Little too young, kiddo.  And if hes embarrassed, that's pathetic.|`|DzjT4ApBaa	Well im in 7th grade and me and my boyfriend haven't kissed either. I asked him why and he says that hes nervous and doesn't want to mess it up. They get super nervous. Just let it happen at the right time. He will be ready eventually.|`|55n0wcnVaa	well first off how old is he? And if h doesn't want to kiss you in public go some where private like your house or his and see if he will there!|`|JNY4BEASaa	your still little move on hes a jerk
S3uLASLnaa	Loose the friend. IF she WAS a REAL friend, then she wouldn't leave you because you two have the same interest in one guy, and besides he's YOUR boyfriend.
lGS1zOd6aa	13 color|`|Km2nzm3saa	Movie night at one of your parents house.      Play video games or board games.    Ask your parents if you can bake cookies together or something.    Get him a dog tag or a stuffed animal or chocolate.    It is just Valentine's day and you are 13.  Don't stress over it.|`|4oyDKNHAaa	its just valentines day, but go to the movies/dinner then go back home and hang out or something
UyHLvhloaa	Something from your heart. We are not in your realtionship so anything we suggest won't be genuinely coming from you....Be original, goodluck!|`|TMi1GhSHaa	if you have to ask complete strangers what you should put about YOUR girlfriend on YOUR MySpace then it just really shows how much you truly genuinely care about your girl.. You guys must be quite the perfect couple there.    On a real note though, i would be pretty pissed off if i found out my bf was asking STRANGERS what they think they should put about me on my boyfriends MySpace.. i would be like YOUR my boyfriend not them.. how do you not know what to put? ya.. don't tell your girlfriend u asked strangers about this one.. shes gonna be pissed off.
SzubaKbuaa	He's afraid of committment. He tells himself he can find someone more suitable for him, and convinces himself he shouldn't stay with one girl. Its not that you aren't good enough. He is just not ready for a relationship. Why would you EVER want to be with someone who won't commit themselves to you??? That is torture...walk away with your head held high. And if he comes back, tell him its too late.|`|th4eHIrTaa	He sounds like such an asshole! move on and forget about him. harder than it seems i know... But maybe the other girl will learn!|`|67EaIAvbaa	tell him to kick rocks!!|`|zgDxpqRsaa	4 get bout him move on he isnt the only guy n the world|`|e98RKB35aa	Just move on. Ignore him. You don't want to play that game.
JpXiKJ8Aaa	YES!!!!!!!!HAIR COLOR IS NOT A RELATIONSHIP DECIDER.|`|z5RKvYFjaa	why wouldn't they?|`|ZAppRn5Faa	of coursee they cann!! hair color doesnt matter|`|WCUOr6Slaa	i dont know, u tell me|`|OhKERNlsaa	Le duh. Why would hair color matter?|`|XIrMPT5Faa	why would that matter? haha|`|eKMXNKBHaa	umm yea they can, hair color doesnt matter at all i mean seriouslyy lol|`|OLirEhIjaa	lol, and why wouldnt they? Who cares about colour of the hair? What is important is the attraction between two people.
725d48cf97e0d6f49316a5d742f17eb7aa	Get your friends to ask him jokingly why are he's looking at you. Then judge his response, I'm pretty sure he likes you.|`|gU4zcPAaaa	um, i have pretty much the exact same story.  well do you ever catch him staring?  does he seem to always be looking over at you?  because that is a sign. hhaha, hopefully he does!   because i liked this guy for like 2 friggin years. and i always see him staring but i never know for sure!    YOU GO GURL.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, he likes you. The reason I know is because he ALWAYS looks in your direction, not once, not twice, but always. That shows that you and him are kinda like destined to be together.|`|zxa2fjpyaa	No, it doesnt necessarily mean he likes you just because he looked at you. He couldve looked at other people too but it doesnt mean he likes them. If you really like him, why dont you start talking to him. He will become more aware of you and not think of you as a stranger. Become friends and take the relationship from there.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	perhaps  go for it and start talking to him......|`|UDu828VEaa	Most guys are like this. They do not realize that what they want is at their fingertips, yet they are too shy to go up to the girl and ask her out.  It is like an imaginary wall the guys build around the girl which says stuff like "I'm taken"  or "hands off" or it just is a barrier to the guy.  The only way to break this barrier is to go up to the girl and start talking to them.  Not dirty-like because that is an instant turn-off.|`|lAIU7wlqaa	yea those are definite signs that he likes you.. if he is available then i would just flirt with him and see if he flirts back if he does then make a move.. tell his best friend that you like him and see what happens..|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	it could be|`|972057f8360b85c255e8dbc7c9bcf59baa	he probably thinks your cute, you should talk to him.|`|GuA9zI3haa	guys like to look at girls, so this doesn't necessarily mean anything. although they tend to do this because they think the girl is attractive, which is a good thing for you! talk to him! just walk up and say hi in gym someday, or partner up, they do that don't they??|`|wjBKKL2Zaa	OMG yeah he soo likes you If hes also a shy guy just try your best to make openings so he can come approach you.|`|wBMNNfCwaa	give it a chance...try to take it slowly....talk to him first...or flirt.......MAKE SURE he is single!!! smile at him!!! i think you have a good chance from wat u said!!!                                                   GOOD LUCK!!!|`|KqGgfki3aa	not much unless he made a move or a conversation  try to talk to him and see his reaction
SauyxU3Eaa	Be friendly to him!!  if your nice u have a better chance at getting him to ask u out.  say how's it going or hey whats up every day.|`|ZaTLsifIaa	Be yourself, and flirt like crazy! Put your point across by flirting with him, and if he seems not into you, you might want to back off and wait a little while :]|`|2cld6HLbaa	just be yourself dont change for 1 person.
Lyjy3xO7aa	You're not the one that your parents don't trust.    If you were, they wouldn't let you have anyone over at all.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Yeah, be happy he's allowed over at all. Your parents are doing the right thing. Teenagers, as a rule, do not make good choices. They are not trustworthy. Especially when it's one of each gender alone together. You'll thank them later.|`|hi2QRyGUaa	I'm 23 and live with my boyfriend in a different state, but we're still not ever upstairs by ourselves when we stay with my parents... it's a respect thing.    It's their house and their rules.|`|8cLLhDrfaa	your only 13. your too young. wow.|`|feUMAvgLaa	Your too young, wait till your 16|`|N1qKXDs2aa	YAY PARENTS!!!!!  GOOD JOB!!!!  you, do nothing. just listen to your folks|`|LPilzLnZaa	ummmmmm..... im 13 too and i keep my bfs a secret from my parents..... it sounds stupid but parents are just like that.....and i know, it SUCKS!!!!!!!  when i want to see them i go to a movie with my friends and then he meets us there and we have alot of funnn!!! lol =)|`|gqvvXknQaa	It's a respect thing. I'm 26 and still not allowed to have a guy alone in my room. lol.|`|PV8zgFdvaa	You Are 13, I Wouldnt Trust You Alone With A Boy Either.|`|EeBpGOQPaa	Hmm.. Try to go out places instead, like the movies, or mall if they allow you. I know how you feel though. Just make sure you boyfriend understands that your parents are just protective. Hopefully this wont scare him away..|`|K1MbAdsqaa	tell them your not interested into doing anything.  and you just wanna hang out with him alone, or how about you two go over his house?  or go to the movies?and have a friend come along.      talk to them.|`|hYP6akCYaa	ughh y do people think that 13 year olds are to young to date    comon u kno u wanted to date wen u were 13 cut us some slack|`|zNFqe8Iiaa	YOUR TOOOOO YOUNG!|`|UtrgRjTeaa	If all you are doing is watching movies, there should be no problem. Earn your parents' trust by showing them that you can be trusted -- i.e. no "wandering hands" or inappropriate touching.     At your age it is normal to be experimenting with relationships and exploring your feelings... but it is unlikely that you guys are experienced enough yet to be experimenting with sex, touching, fondling, etc. Get to know your heart better, and the way you feel in situations with the guy you're dating, before you try to add touching to the situation.    For now, behave yourself and enjoy watching movies with your boy. When you've shown that you are wise enough to be trusted alone with him, they should relax more.|`|RZ4dpbrJaa	your parents are doing the right thing|`|rn2chc2taa	uh don't do anything first cuz your thirteen and second because if your dad flipped about his hand on your leg think of what they would do if you went even further|`|pTj97rYnaa	I'm 13 too. I don't really think your too young to date, but I think your parents are just protective because this is maybe your first relationship and all.. maybe you could go to his house? Or somewhere else where they won't have to watch you all the time.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	i still can't get pass you having company in your room and a bf at age 13, i'm stuck there|`|W6MOT7Sxaa	maybe you could try staying downstairs for a while, then hopefully your parents will see that you two are responsible together.  After a while maybe you could approach your parents and explain to them that you guys can be responsible and not do anything wrong when you are together.  Hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|ZaTLsifIaa	Just hang out downstairs and be good and eventually you'll earn your trust back.|`|wyE0oueYaa	I understand that entirely.  They don't want him to "get any ideas."|`|K7iR5wDBaa	God I forgot about that! My dad used to be the same - always knocking on my bedroom door to 'disrupt' anything ha-ha .. anyway ..     You need to make them think they can trust you, don't give them any reason to doubt you or your boyfriend. Have you had a formal meeting with them all yet? Suggest he comes round for dinner to them (I know it's scary but they'll love it) so they can 'get to know him like you do'. Big him up in every way possible. Then if they are still being a bit weird have a talk with whatever parent you feel closer with and reassure them you have no intention of taking the relationship to any next sexual level, you know your boundaries/ he respects that. Explain they have no reason not to trust you, they have raised you well and you won't disappoint them.    And if all else fails? Start going round his.|`|oM6Pem1Waa	You are to little to date you should wait till your older.|`|cCdhHyF8aa	I wouldnt trust you or the guy either..I mean come on your 13 yo why are your parents letting you date? it's way too young..you have your whole life ahead of you.    this is how teenage pregnancy happens.|`|19c926258574a0fc581f5e705d593c34aa	Their just worried is all , they don't want their little girl(even though your not) to get raped, your boyfriend might not be like that but you know parents are very protective of their child. They also don't wanna think about their child getting pregnant (which is what's happening now a days) or the thought of you doing the nasty nasty with your boyfriend. The best you can do is prove to your parents that its all right do as your told and don't do bad things in school with you boyfriend, try to get good grade so you can show them that even though you have a boyfriend its not effecting your grades.|`|x0fLLb06aa	your parents are only doing what they thinkis right and to a certain degree it is. you are only 13 so being alone with another guy in your room is a big deal to them because you know as well as they do what they are thinking could happen. They are only thinking of you, but they need to learn to trust you more but to gain that prove to them that you are happy to do as they wish for now until a little further on in the relationship. but dont push their trust because you wont get it back for a long time. just let them have their say for now and see where it goes. And if your boyfriend has a problem with it explain to them that your parents are just being protective of their daughter. No matter how old you get your parents will want to look after you. Just go with it until you gain their trust a bit more then see howit goes from there. Just dont expect it to be overnight x|`|KkjhkUbpaa	you should let him F*cK the sh*t out of you. That will teach ur parents a lesson.   say u werent gnna f*ck wid him but u did cause they was watching u.    U could probably record it on camera and show it to them, and make it slow sloppy and long to torture them.|`|sV3vVYVVaa	try goin to his house or just be normel til ur parents trust u agin|`|E98Ob9E6aa	I'm fourteen...we are both a little young to be dating...I started dating when i was about ten... but my parents didn't find out till last year. and my parent only allow hugging and a little kiss here and there..see my mom or dad wouldn't flip if his hand was on my leg, but i don know were your parents are coming from too. because yeah what if your bf started thinking  "hey, she's letting me do this? let's see how far she will let me go."  and PLEASE don't say that oh your bf wouldn't do that, because we both know that the guys mind works that way... (no offense) it's called taking advantage of you. that's what you always have to look out for. (I'm not saying your boyfriend is a bad guy, that was just a general statement).  what me and my boyfriend do, is we try not to hang around the house. if we want to watch a movie, we will go to a friend's house, or to a movie theater. me and my boyfriend normally have what people call group dates. I find nothing wrong with them... because me and my boyfriend both hung out with the same people even before we started dating. so we both are COMPLETELY comfortable with these people. and they are comfortable with us too.|`|6k16msZBaa	Honey, you're just 13 yrs old? I can't believe your parents would even let you have one. You're too young to have a boyfriend.       I hope your parents have had the sex talk, whether you are sexually active or not.    Good luck!|`|AA10446613	ur too young to date...
a732fa3f8cddea280f517bd70486000faa	Sweetie, being gifted is a good thing....there are many that wish they're were, like your friends...they are only teasing you because they are jealous, and they want to make you feel bad about yourself because your'e unique and special. Don't tell them anything, just ignore them and be happy with the way you are, that's the way God wanted you to be...so you should be proud of yourself and hold your head up.|`|Z2cImkxsaa	It's perfectly reasonable that they are jealous and feel that they've been cheated out of being "gifted"    But it's ok for you to tell them to calm down and stay out of the gifted person's way too. =P|`|oUBUWfS6aa	Seems like they're immature AND jealous.    You should talk to them about it. If that doesn't help, ignore them and get new friends. You shouldn't have friends that bash you.

If that's the kind of girl you have to make her the center of attention at school, if you do to school. Anyways, you can take her to a romantic dinner or spend the night /day cuddled up in the movies or in your room(hint hint). But seriously get her something personal an that fits her best.|`|Km2nzm3saa	Here are some ideas    a home made card  a poem  a bracelet, necklace  flowers  stuffed animal  surprise tickets to a movie, concert, etc  home made dinner  make sundaes together or bake something together  kisses!    Make a "picnic" dinner for the living room.  Watch her favorite movie with her, if she doesn't have it, buy it or rent it.  If you are old enough get some nice wine, if not get the sparkling grape juice stuff.    Think with your heart!    Good luck.|`|1ee321656a92ea92083cbe0f38a0aeabaa	IF u wanna be original and do something that she won't forget???

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I have a pair of purple Doc Martens/combat boots which would fit the bill marvellously, and look fabulous with a hot pink t-shirt I like to wear over jeans.     I'd practise on a scarecrow. Or similar. Obviously not on my other half because he has to be able to do the cleaning and the hoovering, as well as his conjugal duties.     Do you want up close shots of the target or what?|`|TMi1GhSHaa	wow..|`|1jToUfoOaa	i think you are very desperate for a girl to touch your balls|`|iFYDJyIZaa	You are strange.

Im 6'3 and Iove dancing with petite girls cause theyre cute.|`|XI7JLX6gaa	let him come to youuu.|`|zdlS3fgDaa	When you're dancing put your head on his chest or shoulder.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	if you can't put your head on his shoulder, wear heels.    it just feel so nice there!|`|2Sw7lVueaa	who cares how tall they r? at least he isnt taller then you cuz that makes it weirder specially if you are wearing heals. i had this thing with a guy that is a foot taller then me. i didnt care i actually liked that he was taller then me cuz i could wear heals without being taller then him|`|IBpWBL6Eaa	LIKE EVERYONE SAID LET THIS GUY COME TO YOU GIRL.?
oK9WhUkiaa	age gap doesnt mean anything in a relationship. as long as the two people are happy then thats what matters. take Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones for example....they seem to be the only hollywood couple that are still together after all those years. the only problem with an age gap is sometimes the needs are different. an older man might want more serious things and is likely to be more experienced and might expect more from u. a younger guy, like urself, might feel abit pressured and intimitaded by him. if u feel u have a connection with this guy and u like each other then continue to talk to him and meet him. u are an adult after all...even if people dont agree then its still ur choice and ur life. take things easy and dont rush too much into it. good luck ! |`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	when you turn 18, every age is ok.  28, 39, 65. have fun and enjoy it while it lasts.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	age means nothing. as long as you are old enough you do as  you please. go for it. if not send him my way.|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	im afraid i agree with the first person. army guy = looking for sex, he will see you as an easy target. if you're really into him maybe meet him once and see what hes like. but tbh i would stay away!|`|nci2WOYXaa	Your both legal. That's all that matters. Plus he's army so he's best of the best as far as guys go. There is nothing wrong with this|`|oM6Pem1Waa	you are old enough to do whatever you want.you are 18 that means you are an adult already.|`|huWSAcT4aa	Red flag!! He's too old, and most army guys that aren't married are only after one thing...sex! Sorry, but it's not a good ideal at all!|`|xHkduRCqaa	Your 18, your a woman now.  You can move out of your house if you want to, that's how old you are.  You don't need your mom to tell you who you can date.  Call this guy, know some more info before meeting him again.|`|v0kb4hgBaa	He seems a bit old. Plus if he is in the army he has to move around alot|`|WCUOr6Slaa	you're 18, your mom can kiss your *** at this point...|`|51Ib0kxVaa	Yep you are right, your mum won't approve. But it is your choice.  Think of the reasons why your mum feels the way she does and consider whether she is right.  Personally I think the only way we get experience is to make our own mistakes and realise that our parents were right all along.  But be careful.  Be wise.
SngOU70Baa	how do you know hes not married...you are not tellin him you have a partner|`|tbZNMfAsaa	What? I must be blind because I don't see where you went wrong at all!  Try to just put it out of your mind. I know it's hard, but guys can be like this. Maybe he's busy or lost his phone? There is no reason to jump to conclusions. Hang in there.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	I don't think you screwed up, if this guy is going to get scared off that easily he is not worth your time in the end.  Just wait until your divorce is settled before you move on to him or someone else.  I am sure you will feel more secure and confident. Just take it easy and one step at a time.|`|1FTFCtaNaa	i don't think so|`|PQBEqS8Caa	Its seems that this guy may have some weird issues. I mean come on, he is 38 and he is shy.??? Its better for u to get to know men first by meeting them, then try to have a relationship.  I am 21 and I know this...could explain ur failed relationship,.|`|HAgd5asNaa	Maybe... he died? It's all I can think of.|`|swJuTXcSaa	what was the email|`|JiRa3lgkaa	what did you write on the email and in the text?|`|yy45iAbtaa	he is not contacting you because you already have someone have you thought about that.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Hmm, that is a tricky one.     Why not use the Valentine Day as an excuse to contact him? Not by phone but by mail.    Send him something that you think he would like at the same time you ask him something... I do not know what but it should be a question that makes him to feel that he just have to phone you...|`|mtV7dWJHaa	It always amazes me also when an man goes from hot to cold so quickly.  Maybe we scare them???|`|QvF8dR7Taa	maby his phone is broken or maby he died,but women no matter there age like to play stay away,no come here games almost all there lives.so either you do or don't.but not an in between,so grow up and maby it wont happen again|`|AA10565336	Most anything is possible.  This guy could have felt safe as you were unattainable.  Now; not only are you attainable you are albeit mildly, aggressive.  The second there was any chance he might have to make some sort of a commitment he ran for the hills.    He will return or he won't.  Either way you will  know and either way you will be better off.    BTW, aside from him telling you (a dubious source) he was unmarried, how do you know that is the case.  Interesting thought, isn't it???|`|rp46MQKeaa	this is a long distance romance - maybe he is not Ready to commit and has panicked you do seem needy and that is not a nice situation to be in, send him a text saying sorry and you need to cool it and you back off but leave the way open for him to contact you in his own time.|`|IoyMZNM8aa	You sound desperate, that's really unattractive.      Move on and if it happens it happens.|`|51736e494ebf305ca5b1cba0d35f09e8aa	omg it sounds very familiar f9or some reason(!)... i dont trust guys from UK, its like they have more time than americans anyway I met a guy and he said he would come here and never showed up. my friend met someone online he came here got her pregnant and left and she never heard from him ever again... please be carefull and do not trust seriously!|`|XI7JLX6gaa	just wait a bit.  dont push it too much.  see what happs in the next week or so|`|8zquWvpWaa	He very well could. We are all unpredictable.    It's probably harder since you haven't met in person.  I'd recommend staying with men in your area code, to uncomplicate your own life|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	You were just being played for "fun".  Fun is now over.|`|bX8QaScdaa	I think that if he doesn't call you in the next 2 weeks something is really wrong and he may have some insecure feelings about himself if he hasn't called,text or even came to see you that may mean he's probably in a current relationship or he may even be to insecure to face you.|`|rYWP5j2Iaa	Im a guy and I would think it could be 3 scenarios   1. something happened back home that took all of his time ie family problem, or work problem    2. an ex has resurfaced and he went in another direction.    3. something happened to him like an accident ( I hope not!!) but it happens    I hope it is number 1 and gets back in contact with you i really hope its not number 3  god bless|`|WLYPp24Vaa	Just try again in a couple of weeks or something, if not then i would move on if i was you. And dee just because you have had a couple of bad experiences with brits dont put us all in the same catagory ok! We dont judge your whole nation because we know a couple of people from your country who we dont like.|`|CU7yipOuaa	I don't think you did anything wrong- nor do you appear desperate.    But it can be he's had second thoughts..or there someone else.    Either way- good luck and be safe.|`|3iNobwVraa	I don't really see anything wrong with a text saying have a nice trip, or forwarding a funny e-mail.  This probably has to do with something else entirely or he is a bit of a whack job!     It doesn't change my advice, however, which is: don't ever worry about why other people do what they do.  It's entirely outside your locust of control.  Just say what you mean, and mean what you say.  Doing so allows you to live life without regrets.  And that's a pretty amazing thing, IMHO.  (well, not so humble, actually! :) )
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u can get an attorney, if u have children u would be entitled to child support, really depends on how long u were married as to the amount of alimony u would get. but today they don't give u alimony like they use to, and men  do get by with leaving without paying. my advice would be to get an attorney, and get a job. they rarely award alimony today unless u were married a long time, or have children.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Are there any children?  He will need to pay for their support.  If not, better get yourself a good job.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I would immediately go to a lawyer and file for separation.  It will spell out what money goes where until the divorce is final.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	if you have children he should be paying support for them, depending upon how long you were married he may have to pay alimony|`|4c988b1f1dbba6558aaf1b4303565c38aa	depends on how long you were married.  call a lawyer & free consultation.  He may be required to pay you alimony, because if you did not work during the marraige, then the judge sees that as a lifestyle that he set for you, and may be required to pay you if he's the one that left|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Not happening in my divorce.  Don't you think you should call a lawyer, or do you think you just need to listen to what he wants to do.  Its time for you to think of yourself and your needs.  What about your credit?  Time for a little common sense from you.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Go to legal aid to get a lawyer. He is responsible just as munch as you are. Do you own a home? Are you selling it? You should get 50% of the profit and any other joint assets if there are any.
uuMCGT9taa	you have no credit to get a loan .    look at  18 i wanted to grow up and play house too it totally backfired dont ruin ur credit and hers because you guys cant handle living with mommy and daddy and realizing how lucky you have it.    you must be 18 and have no job to realize what type of things are happening in the REAL world ,jobs are hard to find and some one that doesnt have a job right now shouldnt be taking out loans how do you plan to pay them back    live at home , be smart save get jobs and go on little vacations together b4 you move in get no further education and have an apt filled with kids n no money and throw ur life away.        Key WORD IS WE REALLY WANT !!!! its a want not a need !! remember that .    its not like you both are homeless and stuff.     Apt dont want to rent to kids who have no credit no jobs and no savings you know they check these things right. you gotta have at least 3x in checking and make 3x the rent .    ps do you think her parents will respect you any more or what they will see a big joke out of it ! Be smart live at home save save save !!!!    Every month buy little things first so when you do plan to move out LATER DOWN THE LINE ur more prepared get dishes one month the next get pots and pans the next a microwave and toaster , towels,     remember you gotta furnish a home and pay bills on top of that     just grow up and learn that life isnt always about what you WANT but what you NEED and you NEED to keep ur broke jobless but at home and be happy in love ok.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Just out of curiosity why do you need a loan to rent an apartment?    If you are looking furniture, look on craigslist.com first. They have some really nice stuff on there and you can find some really good deals.    Don't take on the responsibility of going into debt. Before you know it, you owe more than you make!    Oh neither of you have jobs?? WOW how are you going to make the payment? Payments start the following month after taking out the loan!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You need to have a job in order to get one. No one will give a loan out to someone who is unemployed. Grow up and get a job.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	You cant get an apartment without a job, you have to provide proof of income when you apply and must make at least 2.5-3 times the rent. And even if you can find some place who doesnt follow these rules then you still shouldnt, what happens if you sign a 6 month lease and your money runs out? you'll be evicted and wont ever be able to rent anywhere ever again. its extremely difficult to find a place that will rent to someone who has an eviction on their credit. just dont do it, how about you two go get jobs then move in together??|`|RTOmb6vxaa	Unless you're borrowing money from friends or family, you can't get a loan without proof of employment.  Also, it would be incredibly hard to rent a place without employment unless you can pay the entire lease upfront.  The best plan of action would be to stay at your parents, get a job, and save up enough money to pay at least 3 months rent, plus utilities, food, and any other miscellaneous bill you may have.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Ha, Ha, Ha, that is so funny, ah your killing me.  You won't be able to take a loan out because you are both unemployed.  Just wondering did you both drop out of school too?  Not a very bright idea, I'll leave it at that.|`|faOBk7qtaa	At least one of you need a job to get an apartment. You can't even qualify for an apartment without a job.|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	get a job. how are you going to pay for the loan without a job??? they wont even give you a loan if you cant show prof of income!  get off the couch and make something of yourself!|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Ummmm, how will you pay back your loan without a job?  How will you pay for groceries?  How will you pay for t.p., cleaning supplies and toiletries?  How will you pay your utilities (i.e. electric, telephone, internet, t.v., etc.)?    Get a job!|`|tSp6Ad2paa	uh... it may suck but u need to wait til either u or her gets a job. how the freak r u going 2 pay 4 a place w no job? u don't know how long u'll b out of a job. plus the same thing w a loan how do u pay off a loan w no job. they may not even let u take out a loan if they don't think u'll b able 2 pay it back. i'm sure u guys do want to live 2gether but u still have 2 b realistic and it doesn't sound like u r being realistic w urself...|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	Bad idea. Where r u going to get a loan with no jobs! How are you going to pay the rent and utilities with no job. I know you really want to move in together but you must be realistic. Most properties will require job verification & paycheck stubs. You don't want to get into this & not be able to keep the lights on or eat.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	If you move in together without a job, it won't work. First, no one will gve you a loan w/o a job, especially in the state our economy is in. Get jobs, save money and take it from there.|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	first of all... u need a job!!!! i moved in with my husband when i was 17 and he was 18 but he lived with his mom for 3 months, he was working the whole time, so we didnt have any money problems... then we got married and moved out into our own department, moving away from parents means alot of new responsiblities... and ur gonna need alot of money...|`|HKkbqlIuaa	A loan isn't going to help you for long. You both need to be stable before you get your own apartment. I know a lot of people who have made this mistake. You need to sit down and calculate the expenses of moving out vs your current income. (PLUS generally you have to make 2 or 3 times the rent before you're approved for an apartment) If you make barely enough, it's not enough. If you haven't had your jobs for a while, don't do it. Believe me, you will regret it. If for some reason you are unable to make rent and are evicted, that will be on your rental history for a LONG time. I know you're itching to get out. Believe me, I know. I moved out a couple weeks after I turned 18. For about 5 months I lived in a friend's house, paying rent for a room. Of course, eventually, I felt that I had overstayed my welcome, so I left. The only option I had was to move in with my boyfriend's mother, which was horrible! MAKE SURE YOU'RE STABLE!!!!
Zg0n5nOGaa	You'll know when you're in love, trust me.     People misuse the word 'love' so much, that there's basically no definition. Love isn't always gonna include the butterfly feeling, or any other nervous feeling, so you'll know when the times comes, trust me, I've been through it.|`|tpG1KBj4aa	aww its like a llove story! congrats on getting a bf:)    it might be love it might not...just dont get cought up in this just incase it could end up in a heart break...................................... good luck!|`|EdidZdtlaa	i think you should wait it out. you might not you you might fall in love with him or something. but your not inlove yet.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	If someone makes you happy, they deserve a shot.

You won't immediatly fall totally in love with someone, (well there are those "love at first sight" cases...) it just takes time, it will be worth it tho :)|`|8N7echgnaa	when you love him, the words will just come out your mouth. You will just know. It may sound cliche but its true.|`|zNFqe8Iiaa	Ittz not love yet it is Only Like  You never know you might end up having more feelings for him...  I would tell him how you feel :)  so he understands yuh   |`|ZVngHOBTaa	you are doubting the relationship so soon, this is a bad sign    i think you will just end up breaking his heart, dump him before it goes too far and you hurt him.|`|10afe6f9a336d49e73eeb508bd3e9590aa	It sounds like you are in love with him, but even if you arent quite there yet it sounds like you are well on your way...    Being with him makes you happy even when youre fighting? your in love  thinking about him makes you smile/happy? you are in love  You would do anything for him, and i mean anything? you are in love  You see past all of his faults? You are in love with him|`|5s90en0iaa	It's hard to be with someone that you don't love. My cousin once told me after her husband cheated on her "as much as i hate him right now i forgive him. I want someone who can make me sad. That's how I know I really love them". Although her case may be extreeme, it's important to be with someone who you really love. Remember there will always be one person in the relationship who loves the other more.  This guy you're with may love you more than you love him but would you rather be with someone who you love more than they love you? Think about it.|`|IoQhLrhMaa	Its deffinitly not love yet, but you guys like eachother, it could grow!|`|YTdpmPDyaa	it might be but it probably isn't|`|SWqi4Kmjaa	Yeah I agree. Give it time and see how you feel.|`|l57BE2JTaa	i think you should just try to hang out more and that could get you to love him     i think you have lost anything     i dont believe you can fall out of love like what you mean     just give it sometime     you will eventually love him     and if you dont its not meant to be!    hope this help!|`|lajiPUFdaa	Love isn't a maybe thing. :) You'll KNOW if you're in love. If you're uncertain or unsure, you're probably not in love, because love is a feeling that's so strong that it's completely undeniable. If you're in love you'll be able to say, I'm in love, with no questions asked.     But yeah, you won't always get butterflies or surge-y feelings in your stomach/chest, so there are no unmistakable physical signs such as that. But you'll definitely find yourself thinking about them all the time.    And one more thing to keep in mind: love either makes you completely miserable, or ineffably happy. There's no in between.

hDAoKmjPaa	you could put together a little care box like deodorant, soap shampoo toothpaste and toothbrush etc....and give it to that person anonymously.  it might be a little harsh but it will be better in the long run. or you could just start talking about what kind of Hygiene products you use and ask ask about there's and act like you are trying to compare or just be like look i am telling you this because i want to be a good friend...you are starting to smell and i am not saying it to be mean just so you can take care of it so you wont have to be embarrassed about it later. idk that really is a tough one because their feelings are going to get hurt no matter how you go about telling them but at least you told them so they don't have to smell and they will get over it.|`|MhpccWpmaa	Start up a conversation about deoderant... be like "have you tried this brand? i heard it works really good and was thinking about trying it"... maybe they'll get the hint|`|KW2S2oUYaa	BEEN THERE...

Just do your own thing. They'll realize over time that you're really not depressed.|`|1czp3Bllaa	tell them dat u r and pretend to kut urself
3ZJP9pYFaa	When he holds open the door for you next time, trip and fall and then he'll help you up and you can start a conversation. LOL or you can just try and have a normal conversation while walking, or try pointing something out to him. Or just start talking about yourself or present a problem to him and start a conversation :)
7utWpFwnaa	male nature...i do it too. It probably means they're bored or they like music, or perhaps just to fiddle (it's hard for guys to be still)|`|F0sQ18MKaa	I do that. I dont know why. Cause i'm bored i guess
SweWC8p1aa	hey kid is just like saying hey kiddo, or hey dude, or hey girl, or hey punk.. just something cute and funny to say to someone! no worries :D
gys7lVFOaa	Lots of ways!  You must become a detective.  Check his cell phone and internet history.  You should know his schedule--are there any suspicious periods where he gives a vague explanation of where he's going or been?  Lying is VERY difficult.  It shouldn't take much to catch him in a lie for which he can't explain away.    How's your love life?  Is he giving you that intimate love making, just a quick 3 pushes, or not at all?
e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Sorry with what you have going on, I would wait till your kids are (2 &2) preschool age to get a job.  Otherwise with all that you have, you are going to run yourself into the ground.  However, your 9 year old is old enough to help you around the house with little things.  Good luck.
7utWpFwnaa	First of all, I don't think he means it if he said that you can date some other people before your "final decision", as there is a risk of you liking someone else...and of course he would be jealous seeing you with someone else if he really likes you too. If you swap it around, would you like to see your bf with another girl around his arms?  Is dating some more people really that important to you? go with what you really feel.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	If you want to date other ppl, thats kinda dumb! He's your bf and you love him, right? either you love him or not. make a choice.|`|91c6bKdwaa	It is totally up to you but if you love him soo much then  maybe you should just stay with him and keep loving him. If anything were to happen with you two like if u broke up then you should try the dating around thing. Good luck|`|gqvvXknQaa	You're not too young to be in love. My first love was at 17. And I've loved a few others since then. I agree that you should date around and "experience" other people. Go out there and discover yourself first before you even think aboutmarriagee.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well i feel like doing the same thing but i don't wanna take a chance of ruining a good relationship i have with my girl that i been with for a year so im sticking with her cause real love doesn't come around often..|`|gC8xO53Oaa	He doesn't have a problem with it and I think it's a good idea you have experienced life before settling down. Just remember though, if you can, he can. You both have plenty of time to find out if he or she is right for you and the best way to find this out is to date around if you have those urges.Better to do it now then marry and do it afterwards.|`|My79YBjhaa	the fact that you're even thinking about what it's like to date other guys tells me this feeling won't go away. even if you love your b/f, you don't seem ready to settle. you need to date other guys to realize what you already have is probably a "gem" and then it will be too late, your b/f will have moved on. the grass is not always greener on the other side. i got married at 16, i didn't wonder what i had missed out on because i loved my husband - the age difference came between us in the end, otherwise we might still be together.
TIGNT7W0aa	1) probably more than friends    2) I'm assuming it means hooking up, you know...sex.|`|hi2QRyGUaa	Nothing good ever comes from snooping.    There could be nothing going on, or she could've hooked up with him (if it was while you weren't together, it's really none of your business).     At this point, if you're going to stew over it, you might as well come right out and say tell he what happened and ask her what's up.|`|nqMOh2dCaa	ask her, i guess she wanted to try to imply extra meaning on the word together|`|PuD7HUnRaa	She's messing around with you man. The fact she deleted her inbox messages says a lot. You need to seriously consider whether or not you stay in this relationship if she's being secretive about stuff like this.
7utWpFwnaa	Showing interests in her; trying to make you go away; trying to make you "jealous" (he assumes). Next time he does it just laugh at him!|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Duh, hes trying to pick her up.|`|kE2n7HXcaa	He's probably trying to make it clear that he's not that interested in you.  Regardless of whether you're sorta dating or talking, if he's flirting with someone else in front of you, he's making a point, and asking you to give him space.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	He's trying to go out with her.|`|AA11627920	depends.. what are you to him? just friends?
zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, okay i have dated my best guy friend.   And trust me I wish I could have changed that.  Uhm, now we never talk we act like strangers  around each other. I broke up with him. And now  we never even say hey to each other. So try to never  come close with the person you like. Because if you  come to close...and then yall break up yall will probably  like never talk to each other again. So yeah im just  warning you! Good luck :]]|`|w3MziozHaa	I am so tired of females not going for the gusto. Be upfront and ask him out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|10knD5g0aa	Sorry is this a math question? I'm confused    Be careful of he said she said|`|cG7z70Vgaa	Show him or hint to him that you like him adn see what he does.|`|AA12397801	Well hint to Y that you like X so that Y would tell X that he thinks you like him. If X doesn't like you but he found out you like him then just don't admit your feelings. But I think that in order for him to see your true feelings then he has to find out you like him. Get his friend involved in the situation to try and hook you two up. Buf if he doesn't want to hook up with you then just stay friends.  Hope I helped. =]|`|ehVEAPOGaa	Sounds like you need the luck of the Irish.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	what's your question?|`|nVXEm0jIaa	dont try to be his gf if you know he doesn't like you.|`|mCTFHsVXaa	GET THE HELL OVER HIM|`|p52TIrgUaa	don't waste your time....just go ask him if you want to other than that don't waste your time.|`|hmAIMowJaa	do u want to go out with him?  i'm running through the same ?s here...who does he like, do i really like him? and othr stuff...  ask him out. maybe he'll say yes cuz u guys r friends|`|GG8AElwRaa	BCUZ U DONT TELL HIM HOW U FEEL DAT Y HE LIKE SOMEESLE   IF I WAZ U I TELL HIM HOW I FEEL|`|bX8QaScdaa	I think the best thing to do is approach him and tell him you have feelings for him even though you guys are best friends most people hang around there best friend so much they end up having feelings for them so i think you should tell him whatever happens happens.|`|cV5IDoDQaa	what should you do? Seriously are you in middle school. If not, then before like some dance or something, say: Hey wanna hang out here, or wanna come over to my house and watch a movie, my parents aren't going to be home and i know you like these kind of movies (only works if rents aren't home, and you must know his fave kind of movies) if that's too much then invite another girl friend (preferable one who doesn't like him, and knows you like him, and wont giggle and give him hints) let him see a side he will like|`|Zg1v2qifaa	Best friends before boyfriends. Every other girl is in love with him, so he's lucky to have you as a close friend who isn't all flirty around him like the others. You're also lucky to have the nicest guy you know as a best friend.   Don't try to get him to like you or anything. It will make your friendship all weird.  Best thing to do is get over it. :( But it'll be worth it.    Good luck! |`|zvgl1oYlaa	i think u should either get up the nerve n tell him even though it is hard cuz i would hesitate  to, have a friend ask him for you, or find someone else who's way hotter that  will take your mind off of him. hope i've helped....|`|BxaHSwH6aa	Well, if you consider him a good friend, then I'd leave him alone. It pretty much sucks when you date your best friend, cuz if you break up, you're sad, AND you've lost your best friend! Move on. There's plenty of other guys out there! :-)|`|FthNiQj8aa	maybe Y is lying??  this X guy seems pretty kool but maybe you two were just ment to be friends.|`|AbvDf6YUaa	what is your questian? detail plz|`|rRO7cHNqaa	well since X is like your best friend , i think you should maybe be comfortable enough too maybe confront him about the whole situation.  you'll never know the complete truth if you don't ask him yourself.  and even if things don't work out ,remember everything happens for a reason..|`|uqSICQugaa	why don't you pull one of those "who do you like?" games. when i was best friends with my now current boyfriend :) we would do that & i always said no one but it was really him. he wouldnt really say either...    if he says another girl's name or sounds really frustrated then it's probably not you and theres not much you can do except enjoy his friendship and someday he'll realize how special you are and that you were there all along (that's what i did!)      i mean if he really is your best friend you'll still have fun. that's the perks. a little disappointing but it wont last forever    good luck!|`|JtHeyDCHaa	hold up he likes your bf but not  you  and everyone include you is crazy about him ,all u need to do  is pay less attention and stop running him down when the time is write you will be join.|`|ldI8DRu7aa	ughh i have the same exact problemm!!!!...i think you should tell him u like him you never know what could happen :D|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	What is your question ladie.|`|TkPJYlaMaa	X?

5YEKmHqyaa	If you love him dont ever give up on him.  That is 1st and foremost.  He is two states away, but see if you can find time to see him.  Let him know all the good things ya'll went thru and experienced together.  Tell him exactly how you feel, and that you are in love with him.  You have to show him you're willing to make it up to him and assure him that your gonna show him that he can trust you again.    You need to show him all the benefits of him moving back home.  Let him know you will always be there for him and that you never stopped loving him.  Hope it works out.  I kinda had to do the same thing.  Me and my now (fiance) have been thru quite a bit.    Sometimes they get nervous but re-assure him everything will get better.  Everything in a relationship isn't going to be perfect and that you grow from your mistakes.  If there were never mistakes..you wouldn't learn anything. Good luck!!|`|Nyzb6cLraa	Let him know how you feel but don't beg or repeat yourself over and over. Sometimes you need someone other than your significant other to talk to about certain relationship issues. He needs to realize that. However, it looks like your friend is trying to cause problems and that says a lot about your friend. If he really can't trust you over that then maybe there is something else going on. I don't know. You can't make someone love you or trust you. If he really wants to move away, you have to let him. Let him figure it out for himself what he is leaving behind and he will. It's going to be hard but you have to be strong and give him space and let him miss you, give him time to remember all those good times you shared. You both have to be willing to make the relationship work.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You apologized and if he cannot accept it then you can only move on.|`|bLX2eXROaa	If you burnt your bridges you can't|`|6HgiNCmqaa	why cant he trust u by u tellig ur friends u like him? i mean seriously. first of all get rid of the friend who told him.  to get him to fall inlove with u again...u must impress him. but handle this ur way. its not my lfe|`|5wdPKphVaa	I don't understand how you seeking out the advice of a trusted friend in order to better your relationship "hurt" him.     If he's really angry over this, then consider yourself lucky to gotten rid of this loser. Talking to your friends about problems is a sign of an emotionally healthy individual and if he has a problem with that, then I'd say he has some issues.    Or he had already lost interest and is using this a convenient excuse.|`|K7iR5wDBaa	This is going to be tough but ask yourself do you really love him, or are you just with him because you don't want to be alone?     Your friend is either a mega-***** who has her eyes on your bloke or a super-good friend who wants to oversee the situation and make sure you don't do anything stupid, I'm guessing it's the first.     Have you spoke to your Ex yet? If you have already bombarded him with calls/ texts send one last message telling him how you truely feel/ how sorry you are and that you would like to talk. If he doesn't respond leave it completely for a week or so. Then ring him and suggest meeting up to give him his stuff back, you can then talk about it and hopefully everything should have died down.|`|Km2nzm3saa	All you can do is say you are sorry.  I am a little confused?? He is mad because you talked to your friend about your relationship?    If he wants to leave over something silly like that then I would let him go.  He will either realize he wants you and come back or he will just move on.   If he loves you back he should understand you talk to your friends.  It takes a long long long time before a couple can only talk to each other without talking to other people.  It has taken my fiance and I about three years.  Now we don't go to friends, we only go to each other.  But like I said, it took a while.|`|WxBYfQWUaa	okay this is what u do first off what ever friend that was who told him was not as good friend for you.....now just take him out on a date an u tell him everything an how u feel cause from u tellin him it can get him to kinda trust you again....than from there just hang as friends an sooner then u kno yall will be bacc together .....trust me ive been through this same thing ..........not even 2 mouths ago this happend to me .......|`|AlEGoAMgaa	If someone you love wants to be apart from you, then let them go. You can't control them in any way to make them fall in love with you again or anything like that. The thing is, if they did fall back in love with you, you wouldn't want it to be because of some trick or forceful thing anyways. You just have to be a strong person and live life daily like the rest of us. Maybe he'll love you for that.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...there are no guarantees in anything in this life darling...other then being born...taxes...and death reasonably.  God and life don't sit around waiting for anyone on the planet earth here sister.....not even me darlin?...and not even you here either.  If you want something in this lifetime babe?...you're gonna have to get up off of your sweet ash and go get it sister........if he doesn't wanna reciprocate hun?...then too bad for both of you two sweethearts obviously.  Go kill your female advice friend I suppose....what else reasonably can you do\?  He's gonna have to wanna come back all on his own...in order to ever come back...are we clear darlin?|`|EXxtV5VUaa	I'm in a similar situation, and it's killing me too.  You've got to fight for this as long as you can. You love him. Stay strong.  If he's forgiving and appreciates you enough, then he'll come back and forgive you.  If not, then you deserve better.   I know. I hate to hear that, too. But that's what I've been told, and I guess you've just got to accept that even though there's a person worth fighting for, if he/she doesn't appreciate your love and return it, then it's all for naught.  Stay strong and do what you can. He'll come back if he really cares, and you keep fighting for him.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	It takes two to mingle hunny, if he is willing and wanting to get back with you then there is potential for the love and sparks to come back. But if he isnt then there wont be any point as he just wont be commited and willing to make an effort so that there could be sparks and love again. I think you should definitly not give up your career, life and what you want for this man because if he does brake your heart, which is possible then you would have nothing, everything you worked for would be gone. Let him come to you, if he truly loves you he will fly a million miles just to see "the love of his life".    god bless and i hope it does work out to your advantage in the end.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	Create a time machine & go back to the beginning|`|047IPSovaa	once you separate, let it alone.  lots of other fish|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	How long have you guys been apart first of all?|`|EdidZdtlaa	yea go after him. apologize and keep doing it if you want him back. if you want him back that badly then do whatever you can to get him back. explain what happened with your friend and stuff and try and make him understand that you loved him.|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	umm you cant go back!!|`|qYPWKv6Faa	what did you tell your so called friend about him? if you disrespected the man you loved and demeaned his manhood then you can for get it! i can not see why he would not want to be involved with you unless yo said some horrible things or maybe he is seeing your friend|`|cG7z70Vgaa	Sometimes things can not be even though we want them to. Now is the time to move on and get over your loss. give him at least 2 weeks to think about everything. Let him do what he has to do.|`|UDV2UP7Waa	Similar issue happened to me. I showed her a treasure chest box where I kept all the cars and items she has ever gave to me, to help her realize how much I really do care about her. Sad thing is she still wants a break.. more so because of her own emotional problems.    But try that. Let him know how much you care. Show him something that will prove it. Make him something.  If he turns it out, then let him go.    Good luck!    tell me the outcome! Skynyrd1342@gmail.com    I'd really like to know for research|`|CqoTqEu6aa	you can't make someone else be the person you want them to be. you want him to be the guy who was so in love with you, but it sounds like he just isn't that guy anymore. If he still had feelings for you he wouldn't want to move away from you, it sounds like maybe he is looking for a fresh start. It sucks to leave a relationship behind but take from it the things you learned - i.e never get girlfriends involved in your relationship, the only way to keep things straight is to keep them between you and your boyfriend once you start sharing problems with your friends they might get back to him and he could be hurt and embarrassed you shared them -   You'll find someone else amazing eventually just keep looking and try to move on too.|`|w3MziozHaa	If he is calling it quits this fast, then it wasn't love to start with or the love wasn't strong enough.Try to talk to him again, but if he keeps saying the same things, then just let it go.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Well, you made a mistake, and you can't undo things that have already been done.  All you can do is learn from it (meaning drop that so called friend) and begin a new life.      If he doesn't trust you, then a relationship isn't going to work no matter how badly you want it to.  Leave him be, and start trying to move forward.  Find things to keep yourself busy that don't involve other men for now.  Maybe one day he'll see that you were the love of his life and want to try again.  But don't count on it, and don't waste time waiting for it. Life is too short for that.
AG3dYL84aa	Kaia you need to find out more info before you try it again.  Or you're going to get yourself into trouble.  A condom is only the start.  Please find the information.    Keep asking questions but don't get into bed with someone unless you know how to be safe.  It takes time to know.  Good luck.|`|1ujfKqqYaa	um...how old are you??....if you asked this you probably shouldnt even be having sex! but amyway...no you probably arent pregnant!, you used a condom and you didnt say anything about it breanking or coming off so its not likely!|`|w3MziozHaa	I doubt it if you are pregnant unless the condom was not on right. Are you a virgin? If you are, whether you think you went all of the way or not for the most part, you would know if you bled. Go see the doctor or a planned parenthood|`|oU1yUxwwaa	im not trying to be mean but what are they teaching in school. the only way you could be pregnant is if you two had sex and didn't use a condom and he came inside you or if he used a condom and it popped.A woman can only get pregnant twice out of a month....either a few days before her period or a day or two after....|`|ucbrBXK2aa	kepp trying.. and no only if it broke  and i really dont think u are tho  so dont worry|`|MBD2MvfOaa	LIKE IT didn't go in all the way  or what ????  umm the only way your pregnat is if   the condom broke or it came off|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Yes I hate Can I be pregnant yes.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Do i look like a pregnancy test?

And you are having sex?|`|GeNUriFBaa	did the condom break?|`|cG7z70Vgaa	No you can't be pregnant. Sometimes you don't or can't go all the way. It is natural.|`|ZUD25nA3aa	Why would you want to be pregnant??!?!?|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	well  you could be.  seriously, as long as it didnt break.  xx
oPKpGFobaa	First off, don't go there.  You're too young for it, and I know it seems like you're ready for it, but you're not, don't go for it.  If you bring it up, she'll most likely get freaked out and you can ruin you're entire relationship, just wait, I know it's hard, and I know it's tempting, but just wait.
qYlkAyiJaa	GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!    smoking is super unattractive. it's gross and it says a lot about how you don't give a **** about your body.  Someone brought up a good point though: I would take a pot-smoker over a cigarette-smoker any day-- at least that has a point.  Also, women usually outlive men by 7 years or something ridiculous.  And smoking supposedly cuts your lifespan by 7 years... I don't want to date somebody who doesn't care to at least try to stick around for a while. lol.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	it's not unattractive at all. My husband and every single ex-boyfriend of mine is a smoker, and it's never once bothered me.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	on a scale of 1-10 its a 10 on the unattractiveness meter.|`|PP211c02aa	very unattractive to people who dont smoke and very attractive to people who do smoke|`|VSCYTZ38aa	As a former smoker, I find it disgusting. I can't even stand the smell of cigarette smoke, it makes me sick. I'm sure you'll attract more ladies now!|`|tOoJL7sYaa	I personally refuse to date boys who smoke. They smell, cough, and cant run. i'd always be afraid of them being in danger!   My bf got into that stuff and I told him if he didn't quit I would leave him. He did immediatly and we're in love. He also regrets doing it. He told me if I ever smoked he would never talk to me again. I think he was right to say this! Of course I never will...xD I hate it and it's a total turn off.|`|3Qh9QDXCaa	i hate girls that smoke. except weed. i don't mind that.|`|1vGfcIf1aa	if you smell like axe.  than all the ladies will love you.  well at least me anyway.  i love axe.|`|spWtg1Cmaa	Yes they will be more attracted to you. I absolutely refused to kiss my boyfriend when he started smoking and I would never date a guy who smokes.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I don't find it unattractive, it's just a huge minus point for me if a girl smokes.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	I actually hate it. I mean, I lost someone important do to the fact that they were high and I don't want to have to go through that again.    I'm glad you quit smoking, by the way. That's awesome! (High five)|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	I wouldn't date anyone who smoked.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	smoking is unattractive.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	that is A LOT more attractive then a guy that does smoke! trust me. unless you want sluts and whores that will hit and run instead of a nice woman that treats you well then dont stop smoking. but if you want a nice girl that will treat you with the respect you deserve then you did the RIGHT CHOICE! congrats dude. lol. :) stay w/o the smoke you will live longer and get more ladies!!!!! dont go back... bad road to get onto! bye:)|`|YvXYDiBcaa	I personally would never be able to date a smoker because i've seen the long term effects it has had on people close to me.  Plus, if i am int the same room with a smoker, i start coughing and cannot handle it.|`|0c0ywvuRaa	its disgusting, i told my gf to never do it around me ever, big turn off.|`|Luf2zbTKaa	they will definitally like you better if u smell good and it also helps ig you are cute and got muscles!!!|`|MBD2MvfOaa	yeah girls like a guys that smells fresh  so yeah smoking a BIG NO.no NO.|`|GeNUriFBaa	ew ew ew  ew  ew  smoking is nastey.  its bad  i like cough and weeze everytime i smell cigg. smoke.|`|bcb47b3db4004f2e7249f92729d4235daa	Congrats on quitting smoking!!!  Thats awesome! And yes, females will be more drawn to you now. Theres nothing like standing next to someone who smells like an ashtray. Kinda makes me wanna puke just thinkin bout it....|`|thTmuy1Aaa	smoking always has  and always will be absoltuley  disgusting|`|b7gDKbTYaa	Lol sorry man but don't say "the ladies" any more.  No disrespect just sayin.|`|69uizI7Naa	First off I applaud you for quitting it's not easy and you did it! So pat on the back for you....    I personally think it's not just about smelling and tasting like an ashtray that turns women off, it's also about your lifestlye and taking care of yourself... I never dated smokers and married a non-smoker... It is about leading a healthy lifestyle, exercising, eating well, taking care of yourself.... Killing yourself slowly infront of the one you love (or worse killing your friends and family with second hand smoke) has never been appealing to me.... And if you ever want to have kids and find someone who leads a healthy lifestyle then you've just put yourself at the top of the list! It just kills me how many people smoke in the house with their newborns, infants and kids....     Not only do you smelll like smoke, up your chances of cancer and other ailments but your home, your clothes and eventually your skin smell bad....     Again, congrats! and here's to a long and healthy life ;)     Cheers!!

DFJ9m4WKaa	When I was in middle school kissing at a dance was considered a form of PDA (public display of affection) and was a no no. I got detention over it. Just saying in case your school has a policy on that kind of thing.    But kissing a guy is easy. Guys are generally not picky and how you'd kiss a guy alone at home is pretty much the same how you'd kiss him anywhere else. You probably don't want to make out with and french kiss. But a soft sensual kiss on the check, lips or neck is nice.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	You just do it naturally.|`|TtZhVhldaa	With feeling.|`|VZPtCkweaa	middle school dances don't like pda between students|`|qy07K2k5aa	Just get closer to his face slowly, then you either wait for him to take the initiative or you just go in first. Either way is fine.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Definitely, not in front of any teachers(: PDA is bad in front of 'em.    But if you want to kiss the guy... Do it while you're slow dancing, it's romantic. And just go with the flow. Don't think about whether or not you're kissing right. There's no right way, everyone is different.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	the same way you kiss a guy anywhere else|`|1vGfcIf1aa	in the middle of the dance floor when yall are slow dancing.|`|D3agflP1aa	during the slow dance wrap ur arm around his neck then go in for  DA KISS!|`|UDV2UP7Waa	GO NUTS! Get kicked out. It would be fun, believe me!|`|MBD2MvfOaa	JUST GO FOR A SAMLL PEAK|`|aKkDWz5Waa	let it flow. if the driving force isnt there, dnt bother. or actually, why not try for fun :P ?? just do it ppl kiss in different ways.|`|GG8AElwRaa	HAHAHA MY FRIST KISS WAZ AT MY HOUSE OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK  BUT U IZ YOUNG AND U IN MIDDLE SCHOOL|`|4oyDKNHAaa	wait til you are outside or somewhere private|`|uIqvEo8haa	Like you would anywhere else. But I guess since you're at a dance while y'all are slow dancing or off to the side.|`|AhEZdxXtaa	well u stick ur lips out and go in and kiss him =D also during the slow dance best time and after u grind him =D
UU7J2bO2aa	DEAL with it! :)
zKLl9iSHaa	if people see that your getting upset their going to think that theyre getting the best of you, what I do is I laugh along with them so that they see that I dont find it offensive and theyll soon move on to something else because their not getting the reaction out of you that they wanted and if you keep doing that theyll eventually give up or move on. If it REALLY annoys me and I want to shut them up I say thats funny lets laugh about that now in a really sarcastic voice that usually gets them to shut up.  good luck and be strong|`|BRFXdTSEaa	Well im just like you, but thank god i have one good friend that stands up for me or tells me 'who the hell cares?" , well only one friend does that  .But after shes done that to me so many times, i just dont care what people say to me.  their either jealous or ..well jealous of you if they talk s hit about you. I have this one girl whom i never met before , maybe walked by iher on the streeet once, and have her on myspace, but i never met her and shes hates me. People are just weird. Just go who gives a s hit! words are words, and if what they say isnt true for you then you dont need to worry, but if they are..well oops. :)  Also, if it helps just tell a friend and be like "so and so said this and it made me feel .."sad", theyll obviously talk to you, and after like 2minutes stop. you'll feel so much bettter after (:|`|pqOLekE7aa	I don't let what people say get me down. I have just grown acustom to not caring what people think. Some people in my life i do care what they think or say about me, but others that aren't important to me..i couldn't care less. Honestly.. if i get sad and down i just talk to someone  and that generally helps me feel better. I am pretty sensitive to some thigns...i get sad and depressed easily! I just don't think about what they say...think about something else if you can..Or think of the times when people say good things about you.its tough though to not let it get you down...i know that. When people get you down do stuff that makes you feel good/feel good about yourself and makes you happy!  I would have come backs... but they are not language appropriate for here. Some i might have tht would work well..others not so much. if you ever need someone to talk to even though i am a stranger...i can try my best to help you!!|`|Z2cImkxsaa	Well, you have to realize that there's always going to be people you like you, people who don't and people who just don't care either way. I don't think there's a way to stay entirely immune to others' insults (because people need other people for support and in achieving their goals), but you have to realize that there's 4 billion something people on the Earth, and what one of them thinks or says really shouldn't make a big impact on how any of the rest of them think. Also, realize that not a one person on the planet has never been called a name, or dissed by someone else. Realize that everyone has problems and that you can get by without making their problems your own. If your a teen, you need to realize that your living in a huge feudal pot on angst filled young men and women and that everyone is a little stressed out. (and that it does get better, at least from what I understand.)    Sorry, all my comebacks usually take so long to deliver successfully that the guy's walked away before I've even finished.|`|mqXYh2mTaa	OK GiRl WEll DA ONlY WAY 2 SlOVE DiS PROBlEM iS 2 SHOW DEM WHO'S BOSS.

I don't think comebacks are the best thing. The best thing to do is ignore people who say mean things to you. They are doing it because they want to get a reaction out of you. They want to see you get mad and fight back, or start to cry. They love to see that. Don't react and eventually they will find someone else to bully. Also, remember this saying:    Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter, don't mind. :)
K6D34WQFaa	yeah i would love 2 be your friend and trust me you will be able to talk to me about any and everything|`|9QfwT8Wvaa	Sorry don't know you...
AG3dYL84aa	Go ask elderly people who are happily married for 50 or more years.  They were almost always friends first.    If you're thinking about him all the time you are not just thinking about him as a friend.  .You like him alot.  Don't worry about that he's not your type because that's usually the best type.  It's different than your dreams so he will help you create new dreams  It'll only take a nice time alone together or a kiss to ignite you.  Go for it.  Good luck.|`|H5NVYoNOaa	Go for it the best relationships start as best friends.|`|cRlCeEVMaa	yeah go for it   might as well :) and if it doesnt work out atleast you tried right ? :)
cBKpDtWNaa	Oh please don't fight with him you don't can win this kind of thing , try and talk to him when he not with all his friends ..........I hope you have many luck with this ........lot of love Katie|`|dPgP28Aiaa	You could get suspended from school, get assault charges possibly if you swing first, but if he hits you first it's self defense. However, he is harrassing you, and you can get him into alot of trouble if you report him, and I think you should do that instead of fighting him, cuz that will hit him alot worse than a fight.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	What he is doing is illegal - hate crime. Contact your principle and the police.     You can get arrested, expelled from school and get sued. It's NOT worth it.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Wait until he throws the first punch. That way you can claim self-defense as long as you don't beat him into a pulp.|`|dSMdm76Iaa	Don't go and kick his a$$ yet. What he is doing when harassing you is the same thing as bulling. It's against the law. Tell your parents and go to your principal at school. If you where to kick his a$$ he and his parents can sue you. But what he's doing is a crime. Talk to your parents.
HYOQfHbWaa	I think he is interested in you. If you seriously like him then you may wanna gradually take it to the next step. As far as long conversation goes, talk about stuff that both of you are interested in. I think soon you two should be going out. Best of luck.    P.S. May I know yours and his zodiac signs please?
QoVL5cDHaa	You have me panicking now. I am in Devon, and I just looked outside. It is snowing, and the ground is covered. We have to get my baby granddaughter to Derriford Hospital (30 miles away) early in the morning.  However the flakes are large. I used to have an elderly colleague who would quote an old Red Indian saying " Big snow, little snow. Little snow, big snow". I hope she was right, and that the big flakes mean it is wettish and will soon melt.  You last posted an hour ago. Any more news on hubby? Guess he must be on high ground for the snow plough to be stuck. At least the Councils are trying to do their job. I'll keep my fingers crossed.|`|8ut0e6BDaa	I've crossed mine|`|1dqK820Kaa	crossing fingers good luck|`|vCy8GzdLaa	i will  i Hope everything will be okay  don't worry  good luck(:|`|5XGmsQptaa	* fingers crossed*    He will be home safe soon just you wait and see =]|`|ZCo6OFToaa	Consider it done!

yIBYbC98aa	if your both single, give it a go, what have you got to loose? at least you wont regret it and there wont be any what ifs.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Your question is complicated to say the least.  I first  will say that you don't actually know this girl.  If I read your question right, you only know her from a computer site, is that right? Then you do not actually know her, only what she has told you about herself that she wants you to know.  Why would you put yourself in a relationship with any female you can't see, hold her hand and meet her parents?  Be so very careful with this. Think and do some checking to see if she is who she says she is and if she is actually 16, just stay friends and nothing more for a year or two.|`|9tC8zz5Zaa	well im 16 and my boyfriend is 28. We have been together for 7 months and were ok. it was weird at first but our families are ok with it and our friends. We have so much in common and get on really well. its worth a try so go for it.  and how did you meet her? if it was over the internet don't bother.|`|GhTdULa9aa	The age gap seems a big deal.... but if she ticks the boxes go for it...  if it works when your 24 she'll be 20... 38.... 34....  no dramas!
Rkt8tnUzaa	valentines day is comeing up so   go up to her when she is alone and give her a little heart thingy that says "will you be my valentine" and have a cute smile on your face    how could she resist that then set a date   :D|`|teK6BHgzaa	get a freind to ask her out for you that way if she rejects you you can just act like you didnt know anything about it and ur freind was just messing around i always do it when i think a guy likes me it doesnt hurt as much haha good luck hun xxxhope this helps xxx|`|G1ikqQVuaa	just do it.    next time you see her, just go for it, no matter what situation.     who knows? maybe youll both laugh about it somewhere down the road..
DFJ9m4WKaa	Love is like a chemical high similar to some narcotics. And you can try to chase that first high, but in your case it will never be the same. Since she cheated on you, you will never be able to trust her or feel that you are her one and only or that you even are able to satisfy her. In short, its best to move on in life.    However, couples who do try to work things out can do so successfully. But it usually requires actual therapy to rehabilitate a couple to rebuild that bond and that trust.|`|LeY6hx4Laa	its always up to you in the end but i know i couldn't do it again as i was with my ex for 3 years when he slept with someone else and i only took him back because i didn't want to be on my own and didn't want anyone else to have him, but it kept eating me up and thought about him cheating on my every day for a long time, im with someone else now so far for over 3 years he is so different and i wish i had the Strength to not go back! i think it will always eat you up and you wont trust her 100% deep down, you will find someone who wont   cheat on you and you can trust.|`|SKh7P8O5aa	Okay. It was an accident, and you should let things simmer for awhile. maybe a week or 2. If you are perfect for each other, you both will want to get back together, i'm not saying you should forgive her, but you should definitely keep her as a friend, even if things don't work out. She should have been more responsible, and not let that happen. But when or if you do get back with her, you should keep it in your mind, if she cheats again, drunk or not, its done. Cheating once is a mistake, cheating twice is careless.. I hope I helped :]|`|0dqfwKk7aa	She is not that great if she cheated on you.  When you break up with someone you always need time to get over them.  Right now you are having all these withdrawal symptoms and that's why you feel like she is the world to you.    Your better off finding yourself someone else that deserves you and will be faithful. you know what they say, "once a cheater, always a cheater"  I really don't think she feels the same way about you.  Would you ever cheat on her?  Probably not.... because of the way you feel.
1JwMvxo4aa	probly dosnt wanna tell u.. since aparently she's cheating.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	im guessing this is some kind of online relationship type thing that you have going on lol.. who cares. The question is why is she talking to YOU when she is with someone else?? assuming your a man?|`|iEYBCL1Naa	maybe hes imaginary!|`|G1ikqQVuaa	Maybe because you do not personally know him, she feels that it would be uncomfortable to say his name.    If you were saying something about a friend to another friend, would you use their name, or would you say "my friend"?
EXxtV5VUaa	Does he look you straight in the eye? How does he look at you?  Does he care about you?  In other words, is there a chemistry between the two of you that would suggest, even to you, that you're more than friends?  If so, you need to do all in your power to let him know you like him.  Just... don't go too far.  This sounds like it could have potential. Don't give up on it. Remember love should be patient.|`|EdidZdtlaa	i think that he may like you and you may have a possible relationship in the future with him.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	you seem to be a big girl so, if he sends you a message and you get together or after church you be an adult about the situation and let him know that you would be interested in a friendship to get to know each other exchange numbers,e-mail whatever and while you are talking to him look deeply in his eyes and rub his arm. I am sure he is as taken by you as you are with him and things will work magic on the both of you, and continue to include him in your prayers. good luck to you.  Edit- he likes you and if he does not message you it is only because he is a little shy. some times in life you have to grab the bull by the horns or you will get walked on, if he is what you want, go for it.|`|FthNiQj8aa	really the only thing you can do to find out if he is really into you is to wait for the message.
f9sL3WgQaa	yup..sit and wait. Leave it to the lawyers.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	The court can take many directions in the way they enforce the order. The thing is, the court cannot order a credit card company to change names on debt that was accrued by mutually signed contracts.    The only thing that a court can do is order her to refinance a loan or property into her own name, or/and take lump sum payments from large cash pools that she may have available such as 401K and tax returns, etc...    Wait to see what the judge decides to do in order to enforce the terms of the decree.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Sit Back and Wait. Pretty much, you cant force her to pay but the court can or put half the debt in her name (which they hardly ever do).    Good luck!|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Leave it in the lawyer's hands-that's all that can be done.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Let the lawyer handle it. She could face jail time.|`|5LT6LRUZaa	sit back and wait...and possibly wait and wait and wait!    I divorced 8 years ago, my ex was ordered to pay ALL marital debt and hasn't paid one red cent!  I live in a community property state which means it's also community debt, that means they can come after me regardless of what my decree says and I'm now forced to sue him in civil court for reimbursement, I tried asking him nicely, the lawyer has mailed him letters and even have been in court with him over a car he had repo'd...still nothing has been paid back to me!  I'm actually getting ready to go back to court against him AGAIN in about a month over these debts, I'm going to ask the court to order him to file bankruptcy discharging all of the debts in both of our names on it, I should not have to file bankruptcy when he is the one responsible for the debts, even if the court orders him to do this, he still most likely won't, I've been dealing with this for 8 years and every time I get 2 steps forward he runs and hides and I have to move 5 steps back, it's to the point that I will have to discharge not just the debt in my name but also clear his debt by filing bankruptcy myself...which is totally unfair    his attitude is you can't squeeze blood from a turnip, be at least thankful you can get her for contempt of court, in my State the order doesn't fall under those statutes, I can only hope to collect through civil action!    good luck to you!|`|zM2qII1Oaa	give up and move on she doesn't feel any more loyalty to you or those debts.|`|dVlLahozaa	leave it to the lawyers there is nothing else that can be done|`|T7XERY4Waa	I went through the same situation. My ex husband did not follow any of the things the divorce decree said and I lost my credit, 17 years of marital gains, and now have to file bankruptcy. Do what ever it takes to protect your credit!!! I can't stress that enough. I felt sorry for my ex and didn't want to be cruel by taking his dream house or having him thrown in jail. Now it will cost me for many years to come. Good luck!|`|EFaEHXAvaa	Only thing you can do is sit back and watch the bank steam roll all over your boyfriend.     The bank doesn't care who pays the debt, it just cares weather or not it gets paid.   As far as the bank is concerned the divorce decree means nothing to it.    As far as the ex-wife, chances are she doesn't have the money to pay her half so filing a contempt of court isn't going to get him much of anything.      In other words, he's probably just going to end up pretty much screwed over by his ex-wife yet again.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	He'll have to suck it up and pay it if he wants to keep his own credit intact.  The debt is joint and divorce doesn't negate his responsibility.  If the creditors can't get it from her they can (and will) come after him, regardless of what a divorce decree says.  He can file the contempt charge and they'll slap her around a little but if she doesn't want to pay she can get by with it.  In a best case scenario the courts will scare her into paying.  He just better hope she doesn't file bankruptcy.  If she does, 100% of it will fall on him and he won't have any recourse against her.  In the case of my divorce, I took out a low interest rate personal loan and paid off all the creditors.  That way I knew I could handle the loan payments and not have my credit suffer and could pursue collection with him if he didn't pay his part.  As it is now, your boyfriend is headed for a really screwed up credit report.  He needs to do something quick, but I'm afraid she won't be forced to pay.|`|iKORI8CCaa	A job for the lawyers.  The court is the only authority that can bring pressure to bear.  Unfortunate that people have to act in such a selfish manner.      MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|AA11927655	yes now you wait, it is now in the courts hands. It was smart of you to contact your lawyers and let them handle it. good luck.|`|EY2ixfZzaa	Wow that is sad but it happens all the time! I have lost a lot just being married to my husband but that not why I'm not in love with him no more because me I don't need things I just want someone to love to share the rest of my life with, be happy , have someone respect me not call me names or abuse me, things like that the rest I can deal with.... if your bf is having debt problems if you love him you can deal with anything instead of talking to us you should be talking to him and standing by him and telling him that you can handle anything! and just wait and see the lawyer says what going on!!!! that is life with someone that was married and had a life with someone else it happens to a lot of divorced people! so good luck but stand by your man!!!!
4547eab5ec2a01595d1f92cd2bc3c40aaa	I know in Texas you have to be at least 7. In Arkansas you have to be 12.  I dread the day my son turns 12- I want him to stay with me, but whichever makes him happy is where I will let him live.     I am sorry your dad is making this decision so hard for you-|`|rzPIO1aQaa	You are old enough to make the choice and you can go when you please. your dad just wants you to stay, that's why he acts the way he does and talks the way he does. he wants you to stay with him. Why don't you simply explain to him that your not a child anymore and that you can make your own choice when it comes to who you want to live with. You don't have to be rude but make him see your point so maybe he can understand you better and he can back off.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	well if he takes u to court, youll most likely get what u want.  the judge will side with u if u say u really want to stay with ur mom. =)|`|03CZvXGNaa	he is probably saying it to upset your mom and you. i hate how parents often don't think about how they are hurting the ones they love. if you want to stay with your mom, chances are he can't stop you. try not to let his actions bother you.|`|DSp8azw7aa	Depends on how provocative you are.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	you're old enough for the judge to take your opinion into consideration.  ultimately, if your family can't decide then the judge will and the judge will look at what's in your best interest.  the judge will look to see which parent is stable, who has the time for you, who wants you, is it better to keep you where you are or uproot you, etc.    be prepared to articulate logical adult reasoning as to why you want to live with dad and not mom.  also you should explain the same to your parents.  good luck.  i can't imagine how hard this is for you.|`|R2pyXBzCaa	I am going through something similar but i am going to court. Just explain to you dad that your relationship wont be the same if he is forcing you to live with him. And i know in ny its 16. so good luck with everything|`|t5m73eE8aa	i would say his battling with the issue is due to child support or to try to hurt your mom a parent should be happy if their child his happy it may hurt a little but not enough to get stupid over! chic you want to live with your mom then do it if he goes to court then so be it! his wasted money the judge will go with you and if you or your mom have to get a lawyer because of him make him pay for him in a counter suite during the hearing! that will teach him to respect you! lol|`|Km2nzm3saa	How long have your parents been divorced??    In Indiana when parents separate they pick an age and when the children become that age they can decide which parent to live with.  If they did not pick an age then I do not think you get to pick.  BUT your mother can go to court to try to get full custody.      Honestly, talk to your school counselor.  Tell him/her the situation.  They will be able to help you.
yKcZC9Dhaa	you don't love him.  nor do you like him enough to even consider potential for anything outside of friends.

And be your self they will expect something they want from you.|`|nxIBhZoHaa	don't rush it ok chill, it will happen when it's supposed to happen, so just relax just start being friends with more guys and just be friendly but don't rush getting a boyfriend.|`|ISNdzRCHaa	When you stop looking, you'll find him.
783Ve5Pnaa	He could have just been giving in to the peer pressure of his friends. Regardless, he should not have done that. Tell him that if he wants you, he can't have other girls. Be brutally honest.|`|yzNJ3cc1aa	i think he could be into you but you are still not officially his gf yet so he is keeping his options open...|`|E16u8jq5aa	He is just acting like a guy, showing off in front of his friend.  My boyfriend openly points out good looking girls to me :/ then again he isn't that great tbh.  Maybe if he continues give up, but there's no harm in flirting anyways, just don't pin all your hopes on him.  xxx|`|R0kPeJqVaa	its fine. men are men. we like woman and definatly hot ones.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	1-this was in poor form.  Probably drinking involved?  2-he still likes u, but that doesn't mean he's blind  3-this is one of many forms of male-bonding  4-don't take it so hard and don't hold it against him.  Sounds to me like he had absolutely no intention of sending u the wrong message.|`|kTAGjVVsaa	Not particularly. Maybe he was trying to make you jealous?|`|jK5QcKLvaa	Well guys like to show off a lot, so that could be what he was doing.  I know guys that say "that girls got a great body" right in front of the girl they like so.....    I personally think he was just showing off, but who knows!    hope i helped!  ?dArBy?|`|NAvaa1Araa	Uh not necessarily that's just how guys operate! ALL GUYS. I think you're overlooking the whole thing.|`|waAaMKhIaa	As soon as i saw this i thought of that movie He's just Not That Into You.     I think he might like you at least as a friend. The reason he probably got up is because like most guys - they like looking at girls. It doesn't mean he doesn't like you. I think if you really do like him - tell him. It could be embarrassing but i found out its better to tell them you like them and see what happens than to always wonder. I told my friend and he explained he didn't feel the same. We are still friends and talk a lot. It isn't awkward.     If not - how many guys are there - you're guna find someone even if its not this guy.     Also maybe you could talk to other co- workers or if you know some of his friends. That might help.|`|OURQpf7Baa	No guys are guys!  There pigs!  My dad still checks out other girls and he and my mom are still very much in love.|`|iKYmlDf2aa	I totaly agree girl,just start getting interested in another guy.   Cuz this one, is just gonna give you grief. Trust me if a guy likes you he would be totaly in your space only, especially when everything is starting. Much luck!! believe in yourself....|`|155OLueLaa	i think he was trying to make you jealous|`|TMi1GhSHaa	wow.. if he was into you he would NOT do that.. he probably just sees you as a friend.. but hey guys are very visual creatures so he might just of been curious. The only way to tell for sure is if he physically says he likes you.. if he doesnt then might as well move on to another guy or just tell him you like him and see where it goes.
Z6blVa2eaa	Just try to be nice to her tell her that you dont have any money and when she asks for food say no that you are really hungry but sorry and shell deffinatley stop askin.....dont tell her any more secrets and try to introduce her to comeone new that might like her or someone that is like her and hope that they become friends!!!!
MdDag2gdaa	Sorry you feel the way you do. Unfortunately you are kind of stuck under your parents dominion until you can leave for college. Your parents are just trying to guide and help you the best way they see fit. It doesn't mean that you have to like the way they do things. Arguing won't get you anywhere. I would suggest you maybe search yahoo groups and find a group that interests you and finding some virtual friends that way. Personal experience has taught me that life was way easier with my parents when I didn't fight back and obeyed their stupid rules. This in turn led to more trust and more opportunity. Good luck and hang in there.|`|f9soMMuiaa	Seeing how you're only in your first year of high school, you got ALOT of time to solve your problems. Once college comes, you can LET IT ALL OUT!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Go talk to people.    You go to school, there are people there (and boys ;)) go and talk.    Make new friends.    And there is absolutely nothing wrong with strict parents and I'm not saying that because I am one, I'm 17.|`|GYCy25vwaa	maybe switch to a public school  and meet new people    or go to a different private schooll   its worth a shot|`|2J1teFYBaa	I've been there but please don't think attention from guys is gonna help let it come to you don't go looking for anything as far as your parents goes there just being grown ups and doing everything possible to keep you safe and last but not least God is and always will be first and you can always talk to him|`|LWy0LwSlaa	go to a public school,you can meet new people there and parents? well parents can be strict sometimes but don't worry girl maybe sometime they will become less overprotective =D|`|hlvdPjeFaa	Talk about feeling empty. I feel it all the time. Im only 17 and im already sick of life. Just try to be positive, do things which you enjoy. Its all about the mindset really. Smile more often too. Its proven that you feel better when you laugh/smile. You can start with anyone you see and that could be a start of a friendship. Who knows.
783Ve5Pnaa	Dump her. She's not worth it. Don't get yourself stuck in a relationship at that age =D|`|TfzzhYUXaa	13? DUMP HER CHEATING, LIEING BUTT|`|R0kPeJqVaa	she probablly is man. ive been in the SAME situation. my friends and HER friends were telling me she was dancing with other guys and when one asked her out she said yes. and a few other things happened so i had no choice but to leave her.|`|K7IS3NXNaa	DUMP HERRR!  You can't trust a ho|`|NAvaa1Araa	You're 13? Never mind I'd just dump her! It sounds to me like she's a player and doesn't' really know what she wants. Good luck!|`|AA11969954	im 15 and ive been in ur shoes. cept...im a girl and he was a boy. lol  i left him becoz if he really liked me he wouldnt be flirting with other girls. i would sugest leaving her and letting her know she sould get her prioraties straight. :3   emma|`|Aamu069waa	im your age and if my boyfriend fond out that i was callin other dudes hot and they were callin my babe and he said we go out he would really freak. i say that you in vestigate a little bit more into it.|`|dvfeBZtZaa	You're 13. Have a childhood, not a whore girlfriend who can cheat over face book.  Jeez, go out and PLAY.|`|eKMXNKBHaa	i say you try to catch her in the act.... if she is even doing anything and if shes not then tell the other guys to back off thats what i would do if i was in this situation|`|31DirLQvaa	wait cheating like she's bangin a bunch of other dudes or cheating like she's flirting with other guys?|`|EXxtV5VUaa	Well, at 13, I'm not sure you can expect a "mature" relationship.  You can move on, but I can't tell you you're going to find much better at 13.   The fact is, 13-year-olds have not reached maturity yet. You can't expect a "committed" relationship at that age.  I think a key factor in any relationship is trust, though. Make it clear that you don't like it when other guys call her "babe." Don't be paranoid about it, but in the same way that she has the right to ask you to make compromises, you have the right to make those compromises with her.  If she tells you you're just being paranoid, then that's one way to tell she doesn't care enough to make some compromises.   If, at any point, you KNOW that she's dating other guys and you want an exclusive relationship, well, that's a good reason to break up.  Hope that helped.|`|fHhE8Eiraa	For goodness sakes, you are thirteen years old. You shouldn't have to deal with that. If you really like this girl, try to resolve the issue. If you aren't that into her, it may be time to move on. I wish you the best though. :)
gJdUwRdBaa	Let your friend hang out with the other girl sometimes. Just because you're best friends doesn't mean you have to be together 24/7!     Or, you could try to be friends with the other girl. Then, you could get to spend time with your friend, and make a new friend!
AA11706943	Start out- I know you made some mistakes in your life but the one mistake you didnt make was being mine, no matter what you do or where you are im always going to love you|`|iKYmlDf2aa	I love you.

It will help you to start the process.  Share with him the activities of your day.  Keep him up to date on any news concerning your mutual friends.  Then tell him you miss him.  Tell him what you miss about him.  Don't get too specific, leave some things up to his imagination.  Keep it light and upbeat and sincere.  He will have a lot of time on his hands to re-read the letter so trying good penmanship and spelling.  You might want to include a recent photo.|`|DiSOdCFXaa	of he is in prison,   then maybe you'd  just...  start by telling him how much you   miss him  love him  what your doing  or...  just forget about it all together|`|XZHx3v4Raa	-i miss you  -how are you  -your love for him  -how things are  -your waiting for him    thats all i got|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	oh geez  if he's in prison  maybe it's better if ur not together.  xx|`|EdidZdtlaa	tell him how you feel about him and how much you miss him and how you cant wait for him to get out of there.|`|aySEthTWaa	Say what you really feel about them.  Especially if hes in Jail.

I am WITH you.      hope i helpd|`|22a720487a91d24a7f674ec7b1a70409aa	"I woke up this morning thinking about you, about us."  That is a good opener.    Just write what you would normally say to him. Talk about what the two of you will do once he is out of prison. Talk to him about how you miss him and wish you could hold him.      Okay?|`|9dhr9UNTaa	dear ___,    i miss you so much. i miss.... i love .... heres whats been going on.......|`|LLBxpMc7aa	o jeez thats scaryy...    start it out by saying Hey _____ and draw little hearts around his name or something....  then say stuff like you miss him and let him know you are thinking of him    dont forget to spray it with perfume and seal it with a kiss :)|`|NAvaa1Araa	Just tell him how you feel. It shouldn't be that hard, it should come easy to you.|`|LsAjSUv8aa	Well if your planning on being with him forever. just talk about things you two have done in the past. Also, don't forget to tell him you love him.|`|waAaMKhIaa	Tell him exactly how you feel. Also i agree with one of the other answers - if he's in prison do you really want to be with him. Then again i don't know him.     Just tell him you love him and you will keep in contact. Let him know that just because hes away doesn't mean you are going to leave him and forget about him.|`|2KeOmPaLaa	Excuse me, you may be a little crazy if you want to send a letter, I'm sorry, LOVE letter to a guy who is in PRISON FOT CHEESE SAKE!!!
Uj5kuzoJaa	I had a friend like that once too. It made me feel really uncomfortable because I had dumped him for a reason and now because my friend was dating him I had to be civil to him again. I can't tell you why some women do that. Maybe a deep seeded jealousy that even she doesn't know about. Or maybe she feels that you are prettier than her and she wants to prove to herself that she can have the same things as you. It can be really hurtful and painful. I would just tell her that you're no longer comfortable with her dating your ex's. If she doesn't understand, then it might be time to rethink your friendship. Oh and that jealousy you're feeling has nothing to do with wanting him back and everything to do with your friend kind of rubbing your face in your past relationships|`|94GENT5Gaa	Don't let it bother you, she is probably doing it on purpose (who knows why), and getting a negative reaction from you will give her some kind of sick satisfaction.  I recommend disappointing her and not reacting to it all.  If it doesn't pay off for her then maybe she will quit doing it.|`|e3f85c8ad27f26b471ac2a573f549623aa	I would feel a variety of emotions. Weird, awkward, why can't she find her own guys? But I wouldn't let her know that. The why must be because she's jealous.     I think friends exes should be off limits, personally.|`|AGbusTqGaa	I don't care if you have been broken up with a guy for a few years, friends should not date your ex bfs!  It's one of the unwritten rules!  I would be just as mad as you are.  I can't even imagine why she does this, have you ever talked to her about it?  You should try to casually bring it up without sounding like you're jealous or accusing her of doing anything shady.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	There are no rules to dating. You're in a relationship and you have a child! It doesn't matter who she wants to date. It seems like she is jealous of you and is following down some strange path to hopefully end up where you are. Be the bigger person, let her date who she wants.
f5u9sxbTaa	so?  no worries man, don't let it bother you.  Hell, I admit to like using scented soaps! like lavender!

See what your girlfriend thinks? I mean, if it freaks her out, then you aren't losing anything, and if she doesn't mind, maybe she'll give you a manly paint job, with like, flames or something.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	lmfao! wow! well maybe you could paint hers too? :-) that would make her happy!!! whatever floats your boat only you have to know if thats what you want :-) its your toes and your nail polish!|`|EdidZdtlaa	lmso [laughing my socks off] [i dont like to curse] lolz anyways i dont know what to tell you but dont put colored polish on put on clear that way it wont seem so creepy :]|`|TfzzhYUXaa	YOU ARE GAY     or paint your girlfriends nails.|`|3eWGHC4Vaa	well i think she will think it is funny. As long as you and her are the only people who see them who cares??? But if you are going to where flip flops they need to be black. That just seems like the most normal color for a guy. But i don;t think i would care if my boyfriend painted his toenails black.
ZjpVlm9Gaa	Same here...      Believe it or not I'm still alive.     Be yourself and that way, you'll attract the guys who like you for you and not because of how you look. :)|`|KcloaW4vaa	i havent had a gf yet but guess what, i might soon. I cant really tell u what guys look for cause were all different! When a guy is attracted to u, ull know and if u like him back, then it goes from there.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	your only 14!!   why would you worry about it? you cant really date until your 16 and 17 anyway. thats when you get mature enough and one of you have a license and car. its not romantic to have your mommy or daddy drop you off at the movies then pick you back up.   Just a wait a few years and flirt.|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	You shouldnt have a bf at 14.  Whats with all these 13 and 14 year old kids on here?|`|zjNidefBaa	It doesn't matter, i've never had a proper girlfriend. I mean i have close relationships with people but don't go out with them, don't you get that??
L2cg59QQaa	You just have to ignore them. People look into things too much. Just because your a girl, hes a guy. As long as you two know where you stand then dont worry about it. I think its great having a guy friend that you can trust 100% is just a friend. Hopefully they will stop saying it after a while. Good Luck. x|`|LeoazSyAaa	beacuse you act like you like him but dont listen to them there are just fakes and haters if hes ur bestfrend then hes your bestfirend dont worry about the ppl in he backround|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Well the good news is that your friends can see that you're happy with him and they want you to be happy. There really is nothing you can do about them saying things like that about you two. I would just keep stating the fact that you have no interest in him like that. You shouldn't have to change the way you act around each other just because of what people are saying. If you stick to your guns, people will start to realize that you don't like him that way. Another thing you can do is start talking about the guy you DO like. Even go so far as to talk about him in front of your best friend. Once they see that he's not jealous maybe they'll get the hint that you aren't interested in him that way. You can also start calling him brother like "hey what's up brother" or "hey bro". Once people start to realize that you see him as a brother they'll probably stop talking about you guys dating. Just some ideas. Hope they were helpful!|`|BhdDbCdOaa	All I can say is just ignore the teasing as best you can. As long as you respond like that then they're going to think you're hiding something. Just be cool about it. You're only friends, you know it and he knows it, that's all you need.|`|zgDxpqRsaa	well i had dis problem n well i was glad i did but i always had the feeling that if something went wrong our freindship would be ruined but it didnt work out but we r still the great freinds we used to be|`|E812Y8CUaa	Do you think you like him?  you say you don't, but if you want to make sure ask yourself how you'd feel if you saw him dating another girl. If you felt jealous it's probably because you like him, if you were Ok with it you must just be friends.  Don't spoil the friendship! Don't go out with him if you don't like him!  Also you should ask him, for all you know he may be gay!
AGbusTqGaa	You can't make up for stealing but you can stop yourself from doing it in the future.  These kids you're hanging out with sound like they are bad news though.  Maybe you should stay away from them for a while.|`|1OxiOk2taa	Well peer presure is bad- at least you do feel guilty. I would leave the money the soda cost on the counter... then you will no longer feel guilty. And also don't hang out with the guys who made you steal.|`|XZHx3v4Raa	buy a soda from a diffreent store and put it in the store you stole the original from.    never cave into peer presure|`|al8gZcR0aa	Are you serious?|`|dH0HVol1aa	it would be hard for you to gain the confidents but go to the store tell them the story and pay them twice the normal amount|`|L2cg59QQaa	Just use this as a learnign experience. You realsie what you did was wrong, and wont give in to peer pressure next time. Also i woudl advise you not ot hang around while your friends are doign this, because if they get caught, you will be in trouble too.
1mpMfZbLaa	Darling just don't do what I did which was sleep with ne1 that payed me ne attention. It's hard but it's times like these when you can get to know yourself and build your relationships with your friends,good luck

It's so nice!!!!!!!! Personally, I'd love to open a time capsule in 20 years and read that. This is why you must always stay in touch because when you dig it up in a decade or so, you'll be able to contact each other and talk about it. This letter basically says it all. Is your friend writing one about you too?  P.S. I thought your peeing joke was really funny. It reminded me of something one of my friends would say!
vSmop8Vhaa	It sounds like you're not ready to put in that commitment into the relationship.    He's in that stage where he is looking to build a foundation for himself. Looking to purchase a home, finishing up his masters and continuing on his career is what most of us 27 + years old do. With today's rough market, it's what we need to do to keep us competitve.    What he's doing is completely normal.    If you are afraid that he's cheating because he's good looking and has a huge travel agenda due to his work, then you are not feeling 100% secure in this relationship. He may and may not give you the idea of being a cheater but you have to know what you want and trust.    All of this....house purchasing is scaring you cause you want the freedom to choose and feeling what normal 21 year old girl wants. The difference in life (at this moment in time) is a lot different.    Know what YOU want.     In my opinion, I believe you don't want this serious relationship. You are afraid of it getting yourself commited without asking for the long term commitment (sharing a home that he purchase). You still want to feel around, date around and see what is out there for you. Perfectly normal.    Do what YOU want to do. It isn't fair for you or him if you have doubts.|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	In my experience the whole "sex is not really satisfying me lately" is a sign that things on your end aren't working out. I think you are starting to "get over" him|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Seems to me is that he has a lot on his plate but for now just keep an eye out and see what happens. Until you have proof there is nothing you can really fo. And maybe invite yourself when he goes out of town maybe that might relax him and you a little bit more.|`|KJLFVjoraa	He is getting some elsewhere, probably someone from his masters course.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	I understand what you are going through. My boyfriend has his own business and as you know, a business owner's job doesn't end when he leaves the office. It's literally a 24hour shift for him everyday. He's very good looking + travel + businessman as well. He's currently working overseas. I too believe that combination = cheating. I visited him for 2 months under his request. But I too felt that the sex was not really as great as before. Seemed like he didn't want to do it as often. I'm not feeling unsatisfied but I just want to do it more with person I love.    We've been together for 3 years.    I can't shake the feeling that he's cheating on me, but he insisted that he's not. Everytime we're not talking, I feel like he's cheating. But when we talk, I feel like he's loyal to me.    I know people around you are probably going to give you pretty negative comments about the relationship. Just want to let you know that, I understand it's not as simple as it sounds. A relationship is not a check list where you give and take points off with the list of his behaviours. People tend to focus on the negatives. But they just don't know how good it is during the good times.    I'm sorry that I'm not really answering your question. I'm going through the same thing. Good luck to both of us.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Seems to me as though you are just not as into him as he is you. He desnt sound like the cheating type. Getting bored with the sex life is a sign that things are fizzing out , at least for you.   Please do the poor man a favour and work out if you want to be with him for the reast of your life or if you dont, and be honest with him. You will hurt him more if you stay with him and dont want to.|`|FNkaIhaLaa	@ air J, getting some " what " elsewhere,????  and gurl, pleasee try not to stress about this. he is most likely distracted by work or stressed. if you move in with him you can always move out. just try not to be so pessimestic. you said he does 100% at what he says he will do right? so why all of a sudden would he change. have more faith, impretty sure thing's might kick in again, maybe the fire isnt going to burn out =]|`|dVlLahozaa	he probably has something else on the side.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Stop whining until you have something to whine about.

No matter, that you had to spend lots on your horse.  $20.00 limits your choices, but do some searching around, lots of restaurants are offering buy one entree, and get another free. That could be in your range. Or just buy him one of those Sound cards, from Hallmark, that has a song, or where you can record some sweet endearments.  You have known him for a long time, and I'm sure he is well aware of your financial situation, and I'm sure he would be more than happy, just to spend his Valentine's day with you.  Take a look at MSN website, they offer lots of inexpensive ways to spend Valentine's day with your special guy or gal.|`|4oyDKNHAaa	just be with him, go to the movies/dinner or just go to your/his home and just hang out and watch a movie there, just look pretty and he will enjoy the night|`|n8Xk9dlzaa	I think its not really the gift that really matters on valentines day.  You could get him anything and its more of the fact that it came from you.

Have it all prepared before he comes over, gets to your house, etc.  Ever heard, "the way to a man's heart is through his stomach", its more true than you think.  If you can't cook, get takeout and rent a movie, one he hasn't seen (maybe not a chick-flick, try action or comedy - can't go wrong there).  If those two ideas dont sound good enough, buy him a piece of sports equipment.  If none of these will work his fancy, then go get more money. lol. I hope it goes well.
2SSD6BP9aa	It's even worse than you think.  I'm not sure how to break this to you, so I'm just going to come out and say it:  Your boyfriend ... is ...    ... a teenage male!!!    And like his fellow sufferers, he finds porn to be arousing and will masturbate to it.      Yes its true that sex addicts can also be addicted to porn, but not everyone who watches porn and masturbates to it is a sex addict.  Unless every yong male is a sex addict.    I know it bothers you that he finds porn arousing, but you might as well demand that bears stop crapping in the woods.  If you don't want him to lie to you, then maybe you shouldn't make unrealistic demands on him.|`|I2eiLuyDaa	your boy needs yourhelp. porn is like an addiction and not what he can easily stop when he gets addicted to it.
oSxgDvUraa	It can work out if both people are mature and in control of their emotions.  The problem is that one (almost always) will always have more feelings for then the other and will secretly or actually state they want it to lead to a real relationship.  So I guess depending on which side of this you end up, it can be a fun and fulfilling relationship or it can be frustrating and hurtful.|`|gNz0iRIZaa	Nooo, I was friends with one guy before we became "friends with benefits", and we talked all the time, but then after we stopped being friends with benefits, he stopped talking to me entirely. I believe his last words were "Lisa Vancamp, I bid you farewell" and he just stopped talking to me. Now he ignores me at school, and apparently talks a lot of smack about me too.|`|Iarvsn7yaa	Hi,    Before you decide to embark on such a relationship, may I just advise you to see the videos of Jason Evert on Chastity. It will help explain why such relationships will lead to disaster (For you!) and for everyone.     (go to youtube and search for Jason Evert).    As far as I can see - the relationship that you will embark on - is this something you would be proud to tell your kids about? What if this man turns out to be your future husband - is this the kind of story you want to share with your children ??     Would you like your kids to be the "benefits" of someone who has a high sexual chemistry?? Would you?? Would you like them to get paid for it??    I am honestly shocked at how morally low our society has become.|`|bN9giCyPaa	Don't do it!   You could fall in love with him, and he  may not love you    or it could go the other way around If you   don't want to date him don't have sex with him.|`|ulO3556jaa	I'd strongly advise you don't go there
hZ9omSataa	ask her, talk to her|`|NAvaa1Araa	Ask her out already!
txhkQRD9aa	first of all thats adorable (:  secondly, it perfectly normal to feel nervous.  and you'll probably get crazy butterflies in your stomach on your way to see him.   start as if you'd talk to any friend, brng up sports, the movie, anything he's interested in, things you have in common, and give him a compliment.  have fun and dont forget to be yourself!|`|CyHJlCZXaa	Just carry on acting the way you were before. I'm sure if he said he was interested, then he likes the way you were before.|`|IOMiV6e3aa	when arriving (or getting in the car - whatever) say hi to everyone - hi anita, hey karen and then hi to him - with a smile. and then let it go. Listen when he talks and look for an opportunity to join the conversation. (dont force this or you'll look like you are trying too hard).  If your friends start pushing you together in an embarrassing way, then just look to him and say "they've lost their minds" or something that puts you two on the same side. Guys like girls that can be friends with their friends. Dont show too much interest in his friends - talk to one then the other and not the same one over and over. If  you dont act too pushy or aggressive, then it wont feel uncomfortable when you make sure you are strategically placed so that you end up sitting together....|`|sr7jX2wYaa	If you haven't really spoken to him, first off   just  go up & introduce your self, Then say something about the movie  you are about to see. Ask him where he likes to sit  when  he goes to a movie. & say where you do . I know it is kind of  lame, but  it gets conversation going, & will help ease your shyness a bit*|`|LvI4jRd8aa	Just be yourself. Talk about stuff like music or what other movies he's seen or liked. Talk about your interests and hobbies. Just let him get to know you. Don't stress out too much about it or it will show. Also it's not the end of the world if there ends up nothing happening between you so just be calm and have fun!|`|LLBxpMc7aa	just be yourself and talk to him :)    dont be nervous it will be ok|`|NAvaa1Araa	Just be yourself, talk about common interests, really focus on getting to know him better! Don't worry though it's gonna be fine!    Have fun and good luck!|`|mzXnweedaa	Have some guts girl and go talk to him|`|Jusnu14oaa	basically act normal like have a convo with him and be like i was the girl that texted you that and i really want to get to know you and all that stuff and like go get yo man girl good luck!|`|ZmUgUl65aa	You shouldn't be nervous, just be calm and collected. Try to get to know him as a friend and don't seem overly excited about seeing him.|`|Y3GvVcs6aa	id just go along and act like i didnt no anything. be normal and yourself. when its to going with him do it when it feels right for you and u wont go wrong    enjoy
