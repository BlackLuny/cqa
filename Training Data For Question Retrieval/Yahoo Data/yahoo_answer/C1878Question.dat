20090225082007AAjgcGm	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Developing multiplayer card game?	HELLO!      I'm on to build a multiplayer card game. I have enough JavaScript and mySQL knowledge to start. But I'm not sure, which enviroment would be the best to build a game like that.      I used to play around with Flash few years ago, but didn't manage to get much information on ActionScript. Today it's all different. Many tutorials and many multiplayer games created in Flash circling the web.         Q1: What is the best enviroment to build a multiplayer game for a developer like myself (not much professional, but want to learn a lot)?      Q2: When someone on the other side of the world makes 'a move', does it all work on loop? Meaning, JavaScript or Flash on the side of other players constantly checking for a feedback. Isn't this loop  too big  to handle for a server, once many games are on?      Q3: What's most optimal to do with the database? What kind of information (in general) should stay in a Script and what should be sent in the database?      Q4: I searched for many tutorials, amongst them the ones on kirupa.com and developertutorials.com. Do you know any good website to get practical advice? Not just small bits of a script.         MY POINT:   I'm not very good with this kind of developing (yet), so my questions seem to narrow in a certain direction. But I have none :)   I want to make a multiplayer game, where players can play live against each other and I'm not sure what set of scripts to use and where to get a decent help on those scripts.      Hope you weren't frightened by many Q's as the outcome is indeed much shorter :)      THANKS A LOT!

Comes with 6GB DDR2 SDRAM (2x2048MB and 2x1024MB). Has a 500GB hard drive. NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GS w/512MB graphics card and NVIDIA nForce 10/100/1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet) networking. The primary media drive is LightScribe Super Multi 8X DVDRW w/Double Layer.      The second one is an HP Pavilion m9300t Intel Core2Quad Q6600 computer with 3GB DDR2 SDRAM memory and a 300 GB hard drive.    The primary media drive is High Definition DVDROM BluRay Read/Write and it comes with a NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GS w/768MB graphics card. The networking is Intel 82566DC 10/100/1000 Mb/s.

20090227121939AAtbkRu	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Why doesn't Firefox work with eBay?	It doesn't handle PhotoBucket very well either. :-(   I've tried looking it up on the Firefox forums and Google searches but there is very little mentioned about the problem at all.      I know I'm not the only person on the Planet whose computer is affected because I did a complete re-installation of Windows XP and I still get the same screwed-up eBay screen.      I know I can use IE or an IE Tab (IE extension crashes for some reason) but what about people who don't have IE? I love Firefox but the cracks are starting to show.      Is Firefox dying? I don't want to go back to stuffy old Internet Explorer but a lot of major websites aren't fully compatible with Firefox.

Ok, I was at my friend's house and we were on the computer and I asked him why he has Firefox on a windows operating computer? and he said because Russia is releasing a Virus that attacks Internet Explorer. So I went to school today and I asked if it was true (In 8th). And my teacher said "Yes it is, I was warned about it just a little while ago." So I asked if I should download Firefox? And he said "yeah, Firefox is probably the best 1 on the market right now" So yeah, I was just wondering if I should download Firefox to protect my computer from any viruses.      And I have AIM which opens up Internet Explorer automatically when I sign in, If I download Firefox, will I-E pop up or Firefox?

If so, what kind of personal details would the new owner need to give?      Thanks to all the people who've replied already. I seem to have mislaid the facts. The domain name is already owned by someone else; but i have bought it off them. Now they need to transfer ownership to me. They contacted me asking for a dns, etc; but i don't have any of that yet. I just need the domain transferred to me personally before i can start work on it. Yes the name is that important. Thanks again.

20090227121005AAOJF08	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	How do I share a USB drive?	I have two computers with windows vista operating system. I purchased a terabyte size usb hard drive. I connected it to one of the computers and shared the entire drive. I was able to use and mount it with a new drive letter on my other computer. I found out that the drive was not able to store a DVD image, because the file was too large, so I took a backup of the contents of the usb drive, reformatted it to NTFS file system and copied the backup back to it. The drive works ok on the computer it is connected to, but now I am unable to use it on the other computer through the network. The drive is still seen as a shared folder on the network, but when I try to use it I get the error code 0x80070005. I tried to make sure that all the access bits, and file sharing are set properly, but I am still unable to get access on the other computer. Everyone should have full access to the drive, and I am out of ideas. This seems very weird, because sharing worked ok before I reformatted the drive. I tried rebooting both computers too. I used Administrator username and password to mount the drive.

20080218165212AAnSYW3	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	How can I increase the fps and quality for fsx with my nVidia GeForce 6150le Graphics card?	I have a nVidia Geforce 6150 LE graphics card in my Compaq Presario SR2030NX PC. I run FSX alot, it is my hobby. I want to get better fps and better quality, probably all high or ultra high out of fsx. How can I go about that and how much would it cost.

It is running 1gb of ram, 2.4 gigahertz, Windows (or Vent, as I like to call it) XP Professional Media Center Edition, 200 Gb Harddrive, lightscribe dvd/cd writer reader, look the rest up on google if you have to, i really don't know the rest.

20080705094917AAg0xjP	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	XP Media Center asking for Admin Password?	I have a Dell E510 Pentium D 4ghz, with Windows Media Center, and 2 HDD's. It started to get all bogged down so i decided to just format the C drive and re-install using the restore CD. I have done this in the past with no problems, however, i just re-installed and when it got to the login screen, it's only showing the Administrator account and it's also asking for a password. I have tried leaving it blank, i have tried Admin, i have tried everything. It did not ask for this password before when i last re-formatted sometime last year. But last time i never had an additional drive, could the additional drive be causing this because there are files on it from my previous installation.      The exact message is:    The system can not log you on due to the following error:   The specified domain either does not exist or cannot be contacted.      Any ideas?

20080928094643AAHFg8q	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Does it matter what RAM I use?	I have a sony vaio sr5k laptop that, as much as I can tell from my manual, uses pc-100 sdram microdimm with gold lead contacts.  I did some searching around online and I realized my particular laptop uses 144 pin memory modules.  I'm looking for 128mb memory modules.  I've seen tons of them listed on e-bay and other sites, but when I search on some of those sites by the make and model of my computer, they say they don't have compatible memory.        My question is this:  If a memory module's specs are pc-100 sdram, 144 pin, 128mb, wouldn't it automatically be compatible?  Or is there something I'm not understanding?  There are so many memory modules I've seen online that have the same specs that Sony says I need, yet they are considered to be incompatible when I type in the name of my system.  Can't I just buy any pc-100, 144 pin, 128mb sdram laptop memory module?  Thanks to anyone who can help.

20081016023847AAgfJGw	Computers & Internet;Software	How do I get a static "frame" around my page in Microsoft Excel?	I've only recently started using Excel again, and came across a nifty spreadsheet tool that allows a frame to be put on the sides of the spreadsheets.  It allows, for example, the left column and the top row to remain on the screen, even if you scroll all the way down the page and all the way across - that frame will stay there so you always know where you are.      I think anyone who uses Excel a lot will know exactly what I mean, it's a fairly common tool but I just can't find a tutorial that will allow me to make one like this myself.  Can anyone help me out with a website - or at least the term that people use for this frame tool?      Many thanks!

I've just discovered the package I thought I had with BT isn't quite what I thought .... I don't have unlimited Broadband use!!!

Am I likely to have exceeded my limit by doing this, or does this use not count?   Thanks

He's Backed up onto the disk rather than burning the files.   so i've got a bit of a dilema.   I'd prefer to get this video made as soon as i can, but i can't with the files in .VOB format.      I've tried free downloads of converters, but they all put a horrible watermark over my video, and i can't have that because my Teacher intends to use the video in an exhebition.      Any help is greatly appreceated. because if i can convert them from home, it won't waste him burning the video clips onto another CD, as the ones he's bought are very expensive minidisks...

My college e-mail account is a gmail system, even though we have a different e-mail address (ex. loaves@mail.bradley.edu).   I have 2 main problems with this e-mail system, and I hope someone out there in cyber space can help me!   I cannot get the e-mail to come directly to my blackberry.  I have the email forwarded to my yahoo e-mail account, but then cannot reply from my mail.bradley.edu email address.  Is there anyway I can get the gmail on my phone?  I downloaded gmail for blackberry, but it wont allow me to log in.   Secondly, gmail apparently doesnt have any folders or any way to organize your inbox.  you can add tags but this does not help me AT ALL.  Is there anyway I can get golders in Gmail?      please help!

20090306165433AAaplWr	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Need help hooking up wireless on my Macbook!?	I live in the dorms at college, and one of my roommates just moved out and took the wireless internet with her.  So, I bought a netgear wireless router and have been trying for hours to hook it up correctly. I hooked up all the chords exactly like the manual said, and I go to the website www.routerlogin.net, and it lets me go into the setup wizard, and I set everything up, but my password will never stick - it stays unlocked. And now, the wireless stopped working after a few hours. I'm really confused and frustrated, I'm pretty good with computers and had no problem hooking up wireless for my parent's pc at home, but for some reason I can't get this to work. If someone could give me simple, step-by-step directions I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

Practically any show ever made was listed. A few minutes ago I tried looking it up and I was redirected to  http://www.tvguide.com/jumptheshark   instead of just www.jumptheshark.com.       Did the two merge together and what happened to fans telling why the believed a show jumped the shark? The website they have now seems to be just news articles or blogs of certain tv shows.
