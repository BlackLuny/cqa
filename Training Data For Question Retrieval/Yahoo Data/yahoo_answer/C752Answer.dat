zawmsUO1aa	Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933, as per the 18th Amendment, although the law was flagrantly violated. Because beer had to be transported in large quantities, which became difficult, the price of beer went up and thus Americans began to drink less of it. Instead, they began to drink more hard liquor, which was more concentrated and easier to transport and thus less expensive.    The quality of the alcohol available was far lower than was previously used, and bartenders generally put forth less effort in preparing the cocktails. There was a shift from whiskey to gin, which doesn't require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Ah, the birth of the cocktail!

Many drinks have been around since 1920 and long before that, maybe except for a few of the mass production beer companies which are a lot more recent.

To give you an idea, just a few brands- Stoli has been around since 1900, Jack Daniels probably the late 1800s. and Jose Cuervo the late 1800s/early 1900s, Appleton Estate has been producing rum since the mid 1700s says Wikipedia.|`|ERqwkwv1aa	water.

caQqo67Raa	The reason spicy food burns you is because the capsicum binds to your mouth's pain receptors. This compound is only fat-soluble so you have to drink something with fat in it. I would recommend milk, but you can eat cheese, yogurt, or any dairy really with fat in it. Water won't do the trick.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Are you looking for medication or food/drink?<br>  <br>  If medication:   try Milk of Magnesia. or Pepto Bismol. or just a bit of Bicarbonate of Soda. 1/2 tsp to 1/2 glass of water (read the box)<br>  <br>  If you are looking for food/drink:   try Cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, milk, banana or some food which is a rather greasy like donuts, or butter.|`|tDaU7eYXaa	In Thai, people eat REALLY spicy foods. I know because I've experienced it. The milk might help, but I'd recommend MINT LEAVES.  I don't know how it soothes, but people do it and I've tried. It works. Also, it was in that one movie called, "Bangkok Dangerous" (Rated R, starring Nicolas Cage). It's a great movie and I was so surprised when I saw this mint thing in there because people actually do it.|`|cLa7nwhcaa	The burning sensation is caused by an alkaloid oil in the spices. You need Acid Alcohol Fat as a solvent or Casein to disassociate the oil, or sugar to negate it.<br>  Do the following<br>  1. Eat sweetened yogurt. Yogurt has precipitated Casein to disassociate pungency   and sugar will negate. This is the best solution<br>  All milk products have Casein and wil work to disassociate pungency. However, the Casein in yogurt and buttermilk is precipitated and works more efficientlty. Real natural sour cream also works nice due to precipitated casien and high fat content.<br>  2. Drink cold high alcohol beverage something like Scotch on rocks. Cold beer wil not do it, alcohol level is not high enough<br>  3. Sweetened fresh Lime or Lemonade. Lime/lemon has acid, sugar negates<br>  4. Take a piece of bread soak it in melted butter or Ghee, chew it. the fat will act as a solvent of alkloid oil<br>  5. Swirl a Tablespoon of Honey or another syrup in your mouth and swallow. Repeat. It wil negate the pungency|`|aPscVrOoaa	You can eat some yogurt about a half hour before you eat, it coats your throat and helps prevent burning, especially from acid refulx.|`|JPH16411aa	im indian... i know how it feels... drink milk if u want to, but i find the best thing to do is to put some sugar on my tongue...|`|OiUxoqcPaa	Stop putting food on you!!|`|NxS5D5DSaa	MILK. water will make it worse (as will coke or tea or anything besides dairy) because it helps spread the capsacian. the lactose in milk actually prevents the capsacian from binding to your taste buds.  it was proven on the food network.|`|e5ae26848e029a96cf0e4e8fa138718caa	Just try this simple solution.

Healthier involves a lot of personal perceptions. <br>  If you live in moderation, "healthier" matters little. <br>  Some think salt is unhealthy, but if you have good kidneys, they take care of excess salt.

HbQmDGb6aa	I have been a waitress for years and years, and a few people would always ask for celery salt on the side of their hot dogs, sometimes burgers, once in a while grilled chicken. I must warn you though - if you love it enough to request it out at a restaurant, use discretion. A majority of chef's in my experience do NOT think celery salt is appropriate for almost any food, minus particular soups or something. If you're at an upscale place, hold off asking. It's kind of like not asking for ketchup for a good steak. You just don't do it out of respect for the chef! <br>  Really, though, it does come down to a matter of personal preference. If you like it, put it on anything you'd like it with! I put it in tuna salad.|`|AA12336927	Dalbax must be from Chicago, thats a very important part of the Chicago Hot Dog Weirdest and best thing in the world LOL<br>   I really don't use like Garlic salt, celery salt,  I try to stay away from salt unless I can control it, but yes you can use it on whatever you want|`|uYb5z0JIaa	yes, actually that is ok, very tasty 2, and really u can roast chicken in the oven and it's good as well. i would suggest u put it on veggies, brocolii, potatoes, french string beans, turkey or pork chops. cabbage|`|53giV6PFaa	I love Chicago dogs, and you must have celery salt on it.

Our side were these pieces of bread that had been toasted and buttered, like any regular piece of toast, but the recipe called for a lemon mixture, so my sis made this up perfectly, and, as the recipe stated, spread it on top of the toast.

2c8MZxS4aa	OF COURSE!<br>  <br>  That's they they were meant to be done. Score them with a knife into thirds or fourths on the stick and just break them with your hands where you scored them.<br>  <br>  I now use a small handheld hacksaw i picked up at Home Depot for a few bucks and just saw right through them.

Personally, i have a towel in my left hand which holds 3/4 of the stick while the other 1/4 is the edge. The edge is touching the scored part (obviously :])<br>  <br>  and dont worry if one ends up being too big.. like 1/3. i use it anyway.  works just fine. <br>  <br>  and if you're lazy about it, my bf will just take it outside and slam it on the edge of his apt. haha. it works i guess.. but i'm more finicky. <br>  <br>  i think you'll like exoticas. but make sure you turn on the fan on top of the stove. i dont care for the smell when they're heating up. after that there's no more smell and it doens't affect the taste of the smoke. woot. <br>  <br>  If you have anymore questions about coals in general, try going here:<br>  <a href="http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/forumdisp...</a><br>  It's a list of reviews for different types of coals in case you're wondering about trying out other ones. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped!
Sd8aH8QAaa	Most people have the SMARTS enough to not eat 16 bars.|`|AA11363680	It's not poisonous. If it was it would not be so popular, don't you think.<br>  <br>  It is possible that you are allergic, either to the chocolate, or something else you ate along the way. Don't forget it can take a while for foods to affect you, so what you ate last may not be the culprit.|`|TfXKL4X1aa	It sounds like you're allergic to chocolate. A lot of people are. I feel very sorry for you. The Chocolate bar is one of the best inventions ever created!|`|vs3eMaQ3aa	no chocolate is not poisonous|`|h0Uc3Gcwaa	If it was most of the people in the world would be dead. By the way why did you 16 of them!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|u18GBKmiaa	if chocolate was poisionous i think a lot of us would be on our deathbeds|`|5BOV76bmaa	Chocolate is poisonous is extremely large amounts. but you have not being poisoned don't worry|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Hmmm after like 4 bars you shold have figured something out on your own.<br>  <br>  Where are you parents? Is it past your bed time?|`|JTu1cLkYaa	If it was, I'd be dead long ago. When I was growing up there were ruins of an old dairy that the neighborhood kids would play in. It had old candy dispensers which still had m&m in them. We broke the glass and ate the m&ms, they were so old that they were white. Still tasted good and none of us ever got sick.<br>  <br>  Now, we would have been sick if any of us had eaten enough to equal 16 bars of chocolate. It was probably the sugar and fat that are in the bars that made you sick. Too much of anything will make you sick.<br>  <br>  Dark chocolate actually has health benefits for humans. It's just poisonous for animals like dogs and cats|`|BaNrweQ4aa	chocolate certainly isn't poisonous but it is certainly bad for you if you have too much of it. 16 bars - is quite a lot! i'd say have maybe one or two? 16 bars of chocolate is bound to make you feel sick in some way; as it's just fatty foods - and it's really not good for you (however nice it is) :D people shouldn't be allowed to sell poisonous foods; and they don't. it all depends how much of the food you actually have.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	It's not poisonous|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Too much chocolate is poisonous for dogs, are you sure you're human?
ceQqYxtnaa	...SNAILS|`|CT8pwhM5aa	A big ol' tank of shrimp sounds delicious, but for it to be a sustainable source of meat you'd need a lot more than a tank. Same with fish. Have you considered co-ops?|`|NvwVmiaZaa	bunnies, they multiply insanely, and there meat is really good for people.|`|NiPuaY0Saa	buy them from a restaurant|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	In order to raise healthy crustaceans or invertibrates, you're going to have to provide a HUGE tank and keep it clean, feed them specialized food sufficiently without polluting the tank--because unlike the sea or a lake, there won't be a constant cleaning of the water.  Even muscles will need very clean water if you do not want to poison yourself.  And unless you're willing to constantly replace what you've eaten, it is going to take a while (probably at least a year) to get a sufficient hatch rate going to replace what you eat daily.  I don't think it would be a very economic way of getting your protein.<br>  <br>  Fish too are going to need a large water source--like a huge deep pond, with all the filtration and water replacement, feedings, cleanings to keep the pond clean enough so your fish don't start to get sick.  And you're also going to have to provide things like dewormings and keep an eye on the fish to make sure any illness is caught by you quickly so the ill fish can be removed before it contaminates the others in the pond.  All it would take is some disease to wipe out your whole pond of fish within a week or less.  In summer the pond would have to be deep enough so the fish don't die (aeration may need to be stepped up to provide sufficient oxygen); in winter the fish would either have to be moved to warmer places or the pond would have to be deep so the fish can go down deep to become semi-inanimate through the cold of winter.<br>  <br>  And you wouldn't be saving any money at all, especially if you are starting from scratch.  Your best bet to save money is to go vegetarian.  Legume are good sources of protein.  Maybe raise chickens (but again, there's upkeep and medicines and keeping their space clean 'cause I've seen a whole crowd of chickens suddenly all die from salmonella in their water).|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Raising anything salt water is difficult unless you can do it in an ocean farm. Just a salt water tank is difficult and expensive to maintain and would have to be huge to raise anything large enought to make eating it worthwhile. Freshwater fish also need more room than you can probably provide to raise to a good size and there is considerable expense involved. A hatchery could be a business, but I don't think you're looking for something of this scope.<br>  You should learn to fish. It is fun and relaxing and puts meat on the table. I have fished for trout, bass, pickerel, etc. My dad would even fillet the kivvers (sunfish) and make them with beer batter. I have raked more bushels of quahogs than I can eat at the ocean and the cost of a license is pretty cheap. Crayfish are easy to catch when you find the right place. Tunnels with shallow (1-2 feet deep) are awesome spots.<br>  <br>  I know people who raise chickens and ducks for eggs and meat.<br>  My dad raised pigs once, but vowed to never do it again. He got too attached to them and just thought they were so cute and cunning. Butchering time really wrecked him.<br>  <br>  The first poster is right, my neighbor raised rabbits and pigeons for food.

0Ha3Jbmmaa	Any food from Hawaii is a mix of different ethnic foods. You have Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Portuguese, Hawaiian and on and on. So "local" food would consist of different things. A favorite is a "plate lunch" which consists of two scoops of steamed white rice a scoop of macaroni salad and a main dish.

It is one chemical reaction away from being plastic and now that I have been real butter for so long, margerine is nasty. Margerine has NO health benefits.<br>  <br>  And why would I be so insistent that you eat butter? Take a look at the long list of the benefits you receive when you include it in your diet:8<br>  <br>  Butter is rich in the most easily absorbable form of Vitamin A necessary for thyroid and adrenal health. <br>  <br>  Contains lauric acid, important in treating fungal infections and candida.<br>  <br>  Contains lecithin, essential for cholesterol metabolism.<br>  <br>  Contains anti-oxidants that protect against free radical damage.<br>  <br>  Has anti-oxidants that protect against weakening arteries.<br>  <br>  Is a great source of Vitamins E and K.<br>  <br>  Is a very rich source of the vital mineral selenium.<br>  <br>  Saturated fats in butter have strong anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties.<br>  <br>  Butter contains conjugated linoleic acid, which is a potent anti-cancer agent, muscle builder, and immunity booster<br>  <br>  Vitamin D found in butter is essential to absorption of calcium.<br>  <br>  Protects against tooth decay.<br>  <br>  Is your only source of an anti-stiffness factor, which protects against calcification of the joints.<br>  <br>  Anti-stiffness factor in butter also prevents hardening of the arteries, cataracts, and calcification of the pineal gland.<br>  <br>  Is a source of Activator X, which helps your body absorb minerals.<br>  <br>  Is a source of iodine in highly absorbable form.<br>  <br>  May promote fertility in women.9 <br>  Is a source of quick energy, and is not stored in our bodies adipose tissue.<br>  <br>  Cholesterol found in butterfat is essential to children's brain and nervous system development. <br>  <br>  Contains Arachidonic Acid (AA) which plays a role in brain function and is a vital component of cell membranes.<br>  <br>  Protects against gastrointestinal infections in the very young or the elderly. <br>  <br>  Raw, Organic Butter is the Best<br>  <br>  Believe me this is only a partial list. If a woman is pregnant, hopes to become pregnant or is nursing her baby, I think it should even become a law for her to eat butter for her baby's developing brain, bones and teeth. <br>  <br>  The best butter you can eat is raw, organic butter because pasteurization destroys nutrients.

Note: the rice expands during cooking, so be sure to choose a container that is large enough. Microwave on high, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Microwave on medium-low, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice at any time during the cooking process. Season with salt and fluff with a fork just before serving.<br>  <br>  If the rice turns out too dry, try 15-20 minutes instead of the full 25. If your microwave has number settings rather medium-low, then use power level 4. <br>  <br>  You could also try full power for ten minutes followed by 30% power for four minutes. <br>  <br>  Really hopes this helps.

I'm not sure there really is one out there geared for vegetarians. <br>  <br>  There are many meatless meat products out there that can help you in the transition or after to get protein, etc. They range from fake bacon/sausage, veggie burgers and hotdogs, chicken strips, etc. <br>  <br>  Eat a varied grouping of vegetables/fruits. I go a lot based on color which works for me. So making sure meals have greens, yellows, oranges, purples, etc. <br>  <br>  Rice and beans are a good side or main dish, soy products, etc. Less processed foods (chips, cookies). Really just make meals like you would regularly but instead of meat sub in a fake meat or soy/tofu.<br>  <br>  Since you are going to eat dairy and eggs you will be able to get protein and such from those which is good.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Healthy Eating: eat 5-6 small meals a day made of a variety of nutrients, including lean protein and natural carbohydrates.

Vegans don't eat anything that has to do with animals at all ( eggs dairy that sort of thing ). Before you become a vegetarian make sure you are open to trying new vegetarian dishes and foods, like tofu and eggplant. Oh and make sure to read the labels of foods because there can be animal byproducts in alot of foods you wouldn't expect. Congrats on choosing vegetarianism!

Even easier if you try and eat beans, lentils, nuts or seeds every once in a while.  If you're drinking milk and eating yogurt and cheese you will have absolutely no problem getting all the necessary nutrients.  For example a bowl of cheerios w/ 1 cup milk has 12+ grams of protein depending on how much cheerios....I'm guessing you're a girl between 18 and 24 so you'll probably need 40-48g of protein a day depending on your size and activity level.<br>  <br>  Here's a government website about nutrition: <br>  <a href="http://mypyramid.gov/tips_resources/vegetarian_diets_print.html" rel="nofollow">http://mypyramid.gov/tips_resources/vege...</a><br>  <br>  Here's another nutrition guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetarian-diet/HQ01596" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetar...</a><br>  <br>  you can also go to peta's website, I think they have a starter kit!|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	actually only farm eggs are baby chickens. eggs you get at grocery stores would never grow to be an actual animal. they are not fertilized by the rooster. so you can still eat them. there are many meat free options. you can get fry chick (meatless chicken product) or meatless hotdogs or just about anything. i love eggplant parmigana instead of chicken. it can be hard eating at restaurants at first, because most everything has meat, so you will have alot of salads, but applebbees has a veggie patch pizza that is very good. and delis will make vegetarian sandwiches. it just takes a little effort. good luck!|`|jUuYMVqiaa	being a vegetarian is not easy..if you dont get the right nutrients you can feel sick and wihtout energy like 24/7. eat lots of proteins from peanut butter, peanuts, eggs and maybe supplements.<br>  <br>  >>>the easiest thing transition to do when living a vegg lifestyle is to avoid products that test on animals! makeups, hair products, etc.<br>  (that includes Mars Candy so no Snickers, M&Ms and etc.!!!)<br>  edit: also no leathers or furs and if you have any pets do not give them iams!!<br>  ..just some extra EASY things you could do to make our world a better place.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  side note: what your eating of the egg is actually what would just become the placenta..not the baby chick. sooo stfu..because any action towards ending animal abuse is a action worth taking..even if its not becoming a complete vegan.

I found that the porcelain stains easily, but the Majic Eraser is really majic.  Takes any stains off the inside or out.  I am so pleased to be able to cook with cast iron. It's been 10+ years since I have been able to use cast iron except for camping.  Now I am a more experienced cook, I appreciate the even surface heat.  Sad I don't get the boost of iron that is suppose to come from using cast iron in cooking.  A reason more people seem to be anemic nowadays?????|`|G9WJLBFWaa	Cast iron takes work to maintain. Most people like the dishwasher to get things clean. That is the worst thing for cast iron. It is heavier to handle and it takes longer to get to cooking temperatures. Most people don't like to put that much effort into cooking. Save the cast iron for the people who like to cook.|`|7GrncwiYaa	I love my skillets and use them daily, but there are myths out there that they should not be washed and are hard to season.

I have a super deep frying type pan that I cook the rice in, so I don't have to use any other pans..<br>  <br>  When the rice is about 3/4 done, I add about a cup of leftover diced (cooked) chicken (using part of a store bought roasted chicken works also),  1/2 cup thinly (diagonally) sliced carrots, about 1/2 cup diced onion, and one package of fried rice seasoning mix.   There are tons of brands like Kikkoman, etc..<br>  <br>  When the rice is done..  I stir approximately 1/2 bag of frozen peas into the rice..<br>  <br>  I then push the rice to one side of the pan, spray it a little with PAM, and fry up an egg right in the pan....  it's EASY!    Then stir the fried egg into the rice.<br>  <br>  Finally, I add a little chopped cilantro (but that's definitely only if you're a cilantro lover! --  I think it goes great with Asian or Hispanic cooking) and I let those eating the rice add their own soy sauce, sesame oil, or whatever they'd like to spice it with.  <br>  <br>  Fried rice couldn't be easier!   :o)|`|0a92a06fb2c7565638777b7ba8574ec0aa	You should use cooled cooked rice that has lost some of its moisture, and heat a wok until smoking.

So, you can just take the wine out and serve it as is.|`|rsTB7D1zaa	Yes, in fact due to the serving temperature of white wine it is much easier to store it in the refrigerator rather than keep it in a cabinet like most people would do with red wine.|`|HPn75mp8aa	Yes, they're supposed to be served chilled, not cold. <br>  <br>  Chilled in this case means not right from the fridge but about 10 degrees Celsius. In other words, take it out of the fridge about 15-20 minutes before you serve it.|`|62EycWp5aa	Yes, you can.  Just take it out about 20 minutes before serving so that it warms up to the correct drinking temperature.<br>  <br>  .|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Yes.

og6BDTISaa	its pretty good a typical adult is suposed to drink at least 1 liter of water. Drinking water clears out your whole body that means it cleans your intestines and stuff...which is good lol. plus water is 0 calories and has 0 grams of sugar. WAY healthier than something lyk soda|`|Smg9AjdXaa	no, water is very good for you. actually, you drinking that much water is way better for your body then if you drank soda or whatnot. water helps keep your body healthy, skin looking lovely, and makes you feel better =]|`|319f68749e1561bec57a3eb18244e1e3aa	In a nutrition guide I got, it said you should drink half of your body weight in ounces every day.|`|CT9AOpb4aa	drinking water is never bad for you|`|A0PPXS5uaa	its a bad habit MY FRIENDS DAD DIED FROM DRIKNING THAT AMOUNT OF WATER DAILY|`|eAobNmUTaa	I can't see why you would worry...that is a normal amount :)
m9VCXQPXaa	it's not the point that it's fattening. shortening makes your baked goods hold it's shape after baking. Butter gives flavor to your baked good. that's why some recipes calls for both ingredients is because to have a good shape and to have a flavor at the same time in your baked goods. it depends what you're baking, some really needs shortening or butter for the recipe because it's melting point and components are not the same.|`|32g69LSZaa	Honestly depends on what you're making. Pie crust should be butter and shortening, because they have different melting points, and will result in a crust that is both flaky and tender. <br>  <br>  Cookies you can use all butter, or butter and margarine. If it's a baked good you really shouldn't leave out the fat, so replace it with something. Baking is a chemistry. Shortening is essentially oil, very very refined oil. It's all fat though, so when replacing it with something, keep that in mind. Butter contains liquid, so if you replace the shortening with butter, add less liquid than the recipe calls for.|`|h0CedcMJaa	No, fat is very important in cooking. But sometimes you can substitute shortening with fruit sauce.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Shortening, butter, margarine and oil are mostly interchangeable.<br>  Many recipes are ok if you sub half the shortening with applesauce, but you have to experiment to figure it out.<br>  Have fun!|`|nOVSf06Raa	Lard

I would be more than glad to help you!  Now... I might just cover the basics for now.  In the morning you want to have a breakfast that consists of carbs/fibers/protein.  This sort of tells your body, "Hey! Wake up!"  It's good to eat about 3 meals a day and 2 snacks.  If your are going to be exercising I reccommend about a 2,500 to 3,000 calorie diet.  DON'T drink pop or anything with carbonation in it.  This robs your body of oxyegen.  If you are going to run or do other forms of cardio then you absolutely should avoid it.  Even if you are in great shape you could either get tired more easily than you should or get cramps.  Also limit fast foods to a little to none intake.  For you first snack something like a protein shake is good.  Of course there are many other things you can choose from.  Lunch can have a good balance of carbs/protein probably.  Your second snack can be something like an apple and a piece of string cheese, a handful of nuts, or some grapes.  Dinner should consist of a small amount of carbs because your day is coming to an end.  Carbs give you energy and if those carbs aren't used they turn to fat.  When you sleep, your body works less so you want to avoid alot of carbs.  Have something like a serving of lean meat, some vegetables (green are the best i believe), and a good carb like maybe a piece of wheat bread.  Now I am not a nutrionist, but I know more than alot of people i assume.  Also this is sort of a summary. (lol very long summary eh?)  There is much more to maintaining your body than most people even imagine.|`|f1GlFNxJaa	go to <br>  <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/collections/healthy_breakfast_recipes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/collec...</a> <br>  there are good ideas there

In a blender, puree about 1/3 of sauce, then mix back into remainder. Store in refrigerator.<br>  <br>  ** you could use the leftovers on ice cream if you like.|`|IoKjLtN9aa	If your looking to just whip together a quick and easy strawberry "sauce" throw in some sugar to taste, and about a tablespoon of lemon juice (If you don't have that just substitute with water). Just heat on medium until it's the consistency you want! Couldn't be easier! You're probably going to want to thaw your frozen berries though! Good luck!<br>  <br>  Hope you don't mind I didn't give you an exact recipe! But don't worry it's fool-proof! I use it all the time with different fruits and berries for cakes!<br>  <br>  Edit: totally forgot I like to mash my berries up with a potato smasher! (That's what my american brain calls it!) But you may use a food processor or anything else to press the berries!

53giV6PFaa	I only use butter in my baking. It just taste better IMO.<br>  <br>  Here is an article on exactly what you are asking.  Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Shortening,-Butter-or-Margarine---What-is-Best-for-Baking-Cookies?&id=680334" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Shortening,-Bu...</a>|`|32g69LSZaa	Butter tastes better, but melts faster, so your cookies will spread. Margarine doesn't taste quite the same, but will work quite nicely on it's own, or in combination with butter. Butter flavored crisco is nice if you want puffy cookies, because it doesn't melt as quickly, and don't be affected by the heat in the mixing bowl during creaming.|`|AA11790328	I have tried all of the above. I prefer to use the butter that comes in sticks. The cookies just taste better. Crisco makes them too greasy. I noticed the low fat butter caused the cookie dough to be more runny.<br>  There really wasn't much difference between the butter and margarine. Just a very slight change in taste. I think the type of cookie is also important. I tried this on chocolate chip cookies.|`|b121e2f7b2d398c44662e6d1126ba9d6aa	Butter- richer softer cookies<br>  Margarine - firmer less flavor cookies<br>  Crisco- very soft but no flavor<br>  <br>  Best choc chip uses 1/2 butter, 1/2 Marg. try it!!|`|h0CedcMJaa	It depends on the cookies, butter gives a rich flavor, crisco gives flaky texture, margarine doesn't do much.|`|pckuIRhsaa	For cookies use butter for the flavor. The only thing I use Crisco for is pie crust. You cannot get the light flakiness in crust with anything else. If they depended on my purchases the margarine companies would all be out of business. Btw do not ever use any low fat product for baking. Fat is fat. The way they make it low fat is to whip water in with it. It will mess up any baking recipe.

aMHIA7XMaa	Because in the USA, if you are under 21, it's illegal for you to have alcohol.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	because the US government is hell bent on controlling the youth, that's why. they know that if someone can't legally buy booze they will look to other means to get drunk/high/whatever. hence the illegal drugs and their popularity. they don't care about people, they only care about money and mind control. f*ck the US!|`|hHQIUrNjaa	Because the USA sucks...well NJ sucks the most because u have to be 1 to buy cigarettes I'm 18 its really inconvenient...anyway... US has the highest drinking age bc it sucks. Also, weed is illegal in most states, and the only state that I can think of thats its legal in is Nevada which u can have like an oz of it i think|`|KawVwo1Oaa	Because in the usa most kids that are 18 are still in high school then you would have kids in school drunk and hung over which still happens anyway just not legally.<br>  <br>  My thought is that if your old enough to go to war for your country then you should be able to drink in your country.

Women are better drivers than men, insurance companies pay immense amounts of money to figure out who's best to insure and for how much.  Why do you think it's cheaper for women to be insured?<br>  <br>  2.  I can't answer that....I know what you're getting at and it's a little ridiculous, but a fairly good point.  No one can be perfect, there's no way for 100% social justice.<br>  <br>  3.  Same as 2....but the same can be said for many groups (as can to number 2 as well).<br>  <br>  4.  I think that's a stereotype, I'm white-ish, love watermelon and orange soda, my boyfriend is white and loves fried chicken with orange soda....<br>  <br>  5.  America is a melting pot, get over it.  We are the land of opportunity, if you don't like it, move to Mexico and realize why people are moving here.<br>  <br>  6.  I don't know....my guess is probably on purpose<br>  <br>  6 (You wrote 6 twice).  I'm not involved with PETA and I don't know the validity of that statement, it seems wrong though...what's your source?<br>  <br>  7.  I don't agree with that statement.  I'm not a vegan, but I know some vegans do see pet ownership as exploitation and do not own pets.  Most vegans feel that not getting your pets spayed or neutered, not being a responsible owner is the real exploitation, I think vegetarians (like myself) and vegans probably are very responsible and wonderful pet owners<br>  <br>  8.  Chicken eggs are like womens' periods, not like abortions.  Eggs we eat are unfertilized....much like the egg we KILL WHEN WE BLEED IT OUT!!! HOW DARE WE kill the potential for life, I hope you never jack off or have a period and kill a potential for life.|`|ttYZ2Vwuaa	1. they dont pay attention to the road, though taht is a lil sexist<br>  2.because they are more civilized than meat eaters.<br>  3.because they dont have 32 children, its fine to have a child, just not to overpopulate.

0R46pYb3aa	Onions cause a form of hemolytic anemia in dogs. Acetominophen  (Tylenol) causes the same thing.  The bigger the dog, the more onion is needed to have a toxic effect. The toxic ingredient in onion is thiosulphate.  Symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea and heavy or labored breathing.  What happens is this type of anemia causes the red cells to burst.  The lack of red blood cells causes the poor breathing since it are the red cells that carry oxygen through the bloodstream.  It takes several days for symptoms to appear after ingesting onion.<br>  <br>  It takes more than a small amount or a moderate amount of onions to cause any problems, although a lab test may show indications of anemia.  Once the onion is removed from the dogs diet the problem should clear itself if it wasn't a large dose to begin with, or a dose large enough to show symptoms.  Keep in mind that the toxin accumulates in a dog and small doses of onions on a regular basis can lead to serious disease.<br>  <br>  It's just as bad for cats... maybe worse.|`|hV43wyvJaa	as long as it was boneless no harm done.

And, depending on what you're doing at the party, they might be bored since they're not really your good friends to begin with.  You could do something special for you and your 4-5 friends.  Create and theme, do some fancy takeout, bake some themed cookies, have a nice dinner out, etc.  Or rent out a place and have a bunch of food and games (board games, twister, plastic bowling pins and balls, etc).

Depending on the cost, and I mean if it is in your budget, and your making sushi and it does not have to be with fish or seafood, just plain veggie one, the recipe book is helpful there, but once you have made a few then experiment with your own ideas.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	A total waste of money. I guarantee you will use it once or twice and it will end up somewhere in storage. sushi is thinly sliced fish on top of vinegar rice. You shape the rice in the palm of your hand. If you want to make California rolls then all you need is a bamboo place mat [ a little smaller than a place mat] and practice, practice and a little more practice. If you have a Chinatown close by, make a day trip with the family and you will find someone making California rolls and sushi. Watch them for 10 minutes or so and you'll have no problem doing it yourself. Google for recipes and you're in heaven. Be sure to buy high priced quality fish. My preference is salmon.|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	Don't waste your money on it.  All you need is a bamboo rolling mat.

You can put tea bags in a jar of water and stash them in the fridge and in a few hours have a nice glass of cold tea.  Dont make suntea.  What this does is heat the water just worm enough to encourage microbial growth but not hot enough to kill the little buggers.

Research has validated the old adage that drinking cranberry juice will reduce or eliminate instances of urinary tract infection, but other, more recent studies have also linked the lowly cranberry with increased benefits in fighting heart disease and cancer.<br>  <br>  The Benefits of Cranberries in Combating Urinary Tract Infection<br>  The proanthocyanidins in cranberries can inhibit bacteria from attaching to the wall of the urinary tract. This limits their ability to produce colonies and spread infection. Of course, your mother wouldn't be surprised by this news. She already knows that it's important to drink lots of cranberry juice if you are prone to urinary tract ailments.<br>  <br>  Cranberries and Heart Disease<br>  Because they contain flavonoids, studies reported by WebMD Medical News suggest that cranberries can be a weapon in the war against atherosclerosis, or what they used to call "hardening of the arteries". Flavonoids help reduce the amount of bad cholesterol clogging the walls of your arteries while increasing the level of good cholesterol in your system.<br>  <br>  Cranberries and Cancer<br>  Research at the University of Western Ontario cites increased ingestion of cranberries as a factor in inhibiting the development of breast cancer cells in animals.

iirHRafeaa	It depends on the vodka you're buying<br>  It can range from like, 25% alcohol to 40% alcohol<br>  It's a lot stronger than beer. I'm not sure how you mean to compare it with beer?|`|rsTB7D1zaa	Vodka is almost always 40%.  Flavored vodkas will be a bit lower, 35% normal.  Some are higher, such as Absolut 100 which is 50%.  Very rarely will you see anything higher (Devil Springs 160 comes to mind [80%], but is closer to a grain alcohol).<br>  <br>  Beer is usually 5%, light beer is 4.2%.  With good beers, they range a lot and you should look up the specific beer you happen to have.  For example, many double IPAs are 9-10% while many brown ales are 4-6%.  Meanwhile barleywines are usually over 10% and russian imperial stouts tend to be over 9% as well.  Only the most common beers (pale lagers) are predictable: regular 5%, light 4.2%.  Almost no beers are in the 3% range...

I try to avoid doughnuts though, because if I eat one, it's all over from there. I don't necessarily just shove them in all at once. I'm a picker. I eat one doughnut, then make frequent trips back to the kitchen. I mill around for a tad, pretending to be doing something constructive, but in all honesty, I'm picking little pieces of the doughnut off and eating them. After about an hour, I've picked them to death, and probably eaten more than I would have if I just ate them at one time. *slaps myself*|`|AA12002289	yesss!

n9vByQgdaa	a shot of nutmeg? Not sure how much that actually is. i hope you're not talking about a shot glass, cause you will die.<br>  <br>  eating straight nutmeg (about 4 teaspoons i think) has the same effects as LSD. the main effects last for 8 hours but it lingers for about 3 days. Have a fun trip ;)|`|ml0r6iOiaa	Is it a whole nut or ground powder? I use ground nutmeg in my coffee,but I have whole ones to grate into eggnog. I have never had any ill effects from using nutmeg.
OUXO6g6Laa	You want to thin the mix and balance the taste.  Fruity soft drinks are usually good and the colder the better.  I don't know what to recommend for a peach syrup except peach schnapps (the 15% alcohol stuff).  It's sickeningly sweet on its own and it shouldn't clash with the taste.  Adding some candy is worth looking into as well.<br>  <br>  When I drink syrup, I mix it with fruit juices (usually pineapple, orange, banana, and strawberry).  It works well enough, but it's too much liquid for large amounts.  Protip: you'll get syrup at the bottom of a cup with any mix if you let it settle, so having a chaser ready is a good idea.|`|mLYCUkriaa	When I trip, sometimes I am forced to try some mixed berry cough medicine.

ZJXno2NVaa	THE MILK TO USE <br>  <br>  <br>  The very best mozzarella is made from the milk of water buffaloes. There are lots of these animals in Florida and if you know someone with a cow or two, you might be able to acquire some milk. Otherwise, regular cow milk will be fine. Do not use goat milk, it will not work. Do not use homogenized whole milk for the same reason. Try to get raw milk from a farm store or dairy. Some health food stores sell pasteurized un-homogenized milk and this is ideal for making mozzarella cheese. The key here is to use milk that has not been homogenized. For some reason, the homogenization process renders the milk unfit for mozzarella making. If all else fails, you can use skim milk from the supermarket. Adding back some heavy cream will approximate whole milk. <br>  <br>  <br>  SPECIAL INGREDIENTS <br>  <br>  <br>  You will need liquid cheese-making rennet and citric acid. The citric acid is usually easy to find. In the summer it is sold in many grocery stores in the canning-supplies section. It comes in small jars for a few dollars. You can also find it at some drugstores but it will be more expensive, about $5.00 for the same amount. Liquid rennet is sold by the New England Cheesemaking Supply Co. There are many other companies that sell cheese making suplies and rennet is sold in supermarkets in some parts of the country. <br>  <br>  <br>  THE RECIPE <br>  <br>  <br>  3 teaspoons of citric acid <br>  <br>  2 1/2 gallons milk <br>  <br>  3/4 teaspoon liquid rennet <br>  <br>  <br>  THE METHOD <br>  <br>  <br>  Dissolve the citric acid in 1/2 cup cool water and add to the milk. Warm the milk to 88 degrees and add the rennet mixed with 1/4 cup water. Stir gently for about a minute then let sit for 15 minutes for the curd to form. <br>  <br>  <br>  CUTTING AND COOKING THE CURD <br>  <br>  <br>  Using a stainless steel knife, cut the curd into approximately 1/2 inch cubes. Cut across the top from side to side and then cut through the curd at an angle to slice the columns of curd into smaller chunks. <br>  <br>  <br>  Set the pot into a basin or sink full of hot water and slowly raise the temperature of the milk to 98 degrees while stirring the curd gently for 15 minutes, cutting any large pieces up with your spoon. Continue to stir the curd for 20 minutes longer <br>  <br>  <br>  DRAINING THE CURD <br>  <br>  <br>  Line a large colander with butter muslin and slowly pour the curds and whey into it. It is a good idea to save the draining whey for making ricotta cheese, adding to soups, or feeding to pets or chickens. Allow the curds to drain for 15 minutes then tie up the ends of the cheesecloth and hang over the sink to continue draining for another 5-10 minutes or until the dripping has stopped. <br>  <br>  <br>  IS IT CHEESE YET? <br>  <br>  <br>  Cut the mass of curd into 1/2 inch slices and cut the slices into strips. Put about 1/4 of the curd strips into a microwave-safe bowl and zap it until the curds start to melt and get gooey. Remove the cheese (it is now cheese!) from the microwave and, wearing rubber gloves because this stuff is hot, begin pulling it like taffy. Keep working the cheese until it is smooth and shiny then form it into a ball and put the ball in salty iced water. Keep doing this with the rest of the curds until you have 4 balls of cheese in the cold water. The cheese is ready to eat as soon as it is completely cool. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mozzarella cheese freezes beautifully and will stay fresh in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Once you taste this home-made delight, you will never be able to eat the plastic kind again|`|I7Ee17s0aa	You'll need some cheese curds and hot water to start.  Place the curds in hot water to soften.  Knead with your hands while in the water and form into balls (the water has to be really really hot to make this work!  You might have to rinse your hands off at times in cold water if its too warm)  Once kneaded and formed into balls, place in a pan of cold water mixed with salt.  You can eat right away for wonderful flavor, or wait and let it ripen a bit for  a more traditional flavor.|`|b121e2f7b2d398c44662e6d1126ba9d6aa	use google to find faulkhowser's cheese page... good info.|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	Here ya go.

Combine the ground turkey, cheese, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, half the oil and mustard in a medium bowl until blended. Divide the meat into 4 portions. Lightly toss one portion from hand to hand to form a ball, then lightly flatten the ball with your fingertips into a 1-inch-thick patty. Repeat with the remaining portions.<br>  <br>  2. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet (preferably cast iron or stainless steel with an aluminum core) over medium heat until very hot. Swirl the oil in the pan to coat the bottom. Add the burgers and cook over medium heat without moving them until the bottom of each is dark brown and crusted, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the burgers over; continue to cook until the bottom is light brown but not yet crusted, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Reduce the heat to low, position the cover slightly ajar on the pan to allow steam to escape, and continue to cook for 8 to 10 minutes longer, flipping once if necessary to promote deep browning, or until the center is completely opaque yet still juicy or an instant-read thermometer inserted from the side of the burger into the center registers 160 degrees. Remove from the pan and serve immediately|`|bZe2bSMdaa	I wrap the meat around a piece of brie, season with salt and pepper, pan fry and serve on a bun with ketchup, mayo and grilled apple slices.

It makes for a creamy surprise when you bite into the burger.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	I always add onion powder and Season All to my burgers. As well as an egg to hold it together and keep it moist.

jsIjyDEPaa	Breakfast - make eggs and whole wheat toast with OJ and coffee<br>  <br>  Lunch-  I would make chicken Caesar salad wraps. <br>  I love mission's garden spinach wraps, for the filling make a Caesar salad like you normally would- romaine lettuce, croutons, a little parm, Caesar dressing, grilled chicken pieces - (maybe olives and tomatoes too?) make enough for everyone to have 2 wraps, make sure not to fill them too full or the wraps will break. <br>  <br>  Dinner- Stir-fry veggies and chicken. <br>  <br>  I usually use frozen broccoli and frozen sugar snap peas and then add any fresh vegetables that I have around the house or that or on sale. Onions, mushrooms, cabbage, red, yellow, orange or green bell peppers... or anything else that looks good. I would stir fry each veggie individually and transfer them to a large bowl until you are ready to make the sauce<br>  <br>  For your sauce combine 1/2 cup chicken broth (which you can make from bouillon or use canned) with 3T soy sauce 2T oyster sauce, 1T brown sugar, and 1/4tsp Red Pepper powder or flakes. combine these ingredients in the bottom of your wok and stir until they are well blended. Then mix 1T flour or cornstarch with a little water to use as thickener and slowly stir it into the sauce.

In 1923, The Velveeta Cheese Company was incorporated as a separate company, and was sold to Kraft Foods in 1927. Velveeta features a soft, creamy texture and a distinctive taste that advertisers compare to cheddar cheese, and it is noted for its easy melting.

y2ipbzMlaa	I have never personally had one but my mom has. They have an extremely strong flavor of whatever the marinade happens to be she said. This would be due to it sitting in the marinade for so long. If it's something like a teriyaki flavoring it has a very high chance of being salty. Soaking in whatever will only take off the marinade on the surface. There's a whole biochemical reaction that occurs where the marinade and salt and such binds to the meat. No amount of soaking is really going to be able to change that. <br>  <br>  Even though it's a little more work, just buy a plain tenderloin and marinate it yourself. You can generally find simple recipes for marinades all over the internet, and then you also can avoid any potential preservative taste.|`|MMBrsrbcaa	Two full days worth of soaking.

You are addicted & it's even worse at your age. according to your numbers, I'm guessing you're getting between 1500-2400 mg of caffeine, just in the morning. It's not recommended to get more than 800 mg per day.<br>  <br>  You may not know this but 4300 people overdosed on caffeine in 2003, luckily it's hard to die from it directly, but it can cause heart & blood problems that can lead to death. Luckily the OD numbers have been going down, maybe more people drinking Arabica instead of Robusta (2x the caffeine).<br>  <br>  I love coffee & I never thought I's say this: Stop Drinking Coffee! Get some tea. And stay away from sodas, they're worse in other ways.|`|PhPOLgHGaa	your parents first off should NOT have allowed this period. to much after a peroid of time can cause stomach irration and even stomach bleeding/cramping etc.<br>  <br>  you are addicted to the caffine and without it you suffer the withdrawl like ppl with ciggys ( the nicotine) its ridiculous that you drink that much in a day...specially before school and then again at midnite.<br>  <br>  sounds like you need to be weened from it, talk to your doc...you are to young to have that much caffine in a day every day...hell i am 42 and dont even have that much.<br>  <br>  caffine can have many side affects over time and cause different health issues..something you should try looking up...<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don’t think it’s addicting, try going off caffeine, cold turkey. See if you don’t have a headache for two to nine days. That’s caffeine withdrawal! You don’t need to be a coffeeholic to experience negative physical symptoms. Even as little as one to two cups a day can negatively affect you. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.home-herb-garden.com/coffee.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.home-herb-garden.com/coffee.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Side effects from too much caffeine may include headaches, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, irritability, shaking and high blood sugar.

Place in skillet until cooked, put aside. <br>  In the hot skillet, add just a little more olive oil alow to heat up and then place onion in it, allow to cook until it just starts to become tender. Add in the squash and zucchini. Season it with some more salt and pepper and also garlic powder along with some pressed garlic (or verly finely chopped). allow to cook until desired tendernes. Add a can of either whole or chunky tomatoes, allow to heat through. serve with chicken and or pasta or rice. (the best part about this dish is that you can prepare it at any time of the day, and when youre ready to eat it, just cook up the pasta or rice and re-heat the chicken and veggies)|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Very cool!!!!

Mix together and form into a loaf.  Top with 1/2 cup ketchup mixed with 2 T mustard and 3 T brown sugar.  Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Peel 6-8 large russet potatos and cover with water.  Add 1 T salt and bring to a boil.  Cook until fork tender and drain.  Add 1/2 cube butter and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Mash with potato masher.  If mixture is too dry, add more butter and sour cream.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  For green beans, cut off dry ends and place in pan.  Add enough water to come to 1 1/2 inches. Cover and bring to a boil.  If you have some bacon and a little onion, chop them up and saute them.  Add to green beans while they cook.  Season with salt and pepper.

PNTElcxnaa	MD 20 20 the maker calls it "wine". I favor it because it's good with breakfast.|`|AA11091315	Stella Rosa, Moscato, and Moscato d'Asti.|`|q8N1KZgoaa	I've only tried 3 wines over a few months now and have not found one I enjoy the best but Riunite Lambrusco is the best I liked out of the few I did try...<br>  <br>  Reason I liked it was because of the sweetness and low price.|`|AA11418696	most hardcore wine folks will think this is loser selection- but for me- I love white zinfandel. It really is because it has a nice sweet taste- and I don't like bitter wine.

aNlT1NRqaa	You can start by drinking a black fresh coffee at a real coffee shop (not starbucks). They will have fresh roasted, fresh ground, fresh made coffee. Once you try that, you'll never want instant from a can.<br>  <br>  Real coffee is delicious & like beer, will have endless varieties (some you'll love & others, maybe not as much). Canned coffee has to be stale before it's even packed (coffee releases CO2 for days after roasting - so can't be vacuum packed fresh).<br>  <br>  If, like me, you develop a taste for the good stuff, you can make it from as close to custom as you want. You can buy a fancy Auto Drip machine (never very good) for over $100, or you can buy everything you need to roast green coffee, grind, and brew the best for as little as $200. Green coffee is 1/4 to 1/2 the $$$ of roasted/pre-ground, so it will pay for itself quickly. I love doing it & my neighbors keep visiting when they know I'm making a fresh batch.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Try Dunkin' Donuts' coffee (it's good) and if it's a bit strong, try buying the flavored non dairy creamers that come in french vanilla, amaretto, etc to mix in.|`|qLZVs0lKaa	I don't know if there is another one in the country(I have only seen one here in Texas) But there is this wonderful little coffee place called Shoemaker and Hardt, by my old high school that sells a coffee drink called Milky Way and it's coffee with one of those little tiny cups of espresso, caramel syrup, chocolate syrup, whipped cream on top with these chocolate shavings and caramel on top. It's fantastic. If you don't live in Texas, I'd try the Caramel Frappuccino(sp?) at Starbuck's with TONS of caramel, and lite whipped cream. ^_^|`|qp62VijHaa	Well, maybe you should start with something a little less bold then black coffee and work your way up. Try Cafe Francaise in the little metal tin. You mix 3tb in 8oz hot water and it's kind of like a latte. <br>   Or try espresso drinks to get your palette adjusted. A Mocha has chocolate in it. Latte has milk. Breve has half & half, Cappucino has milk/and foam. Americano has hot water.<br>  If you want to just jump right into Drip coffee, I enjoy a brand called "Tony's" it's from Washington state and I'm not sure if it's found outside the PacNW. Seattle's Best is decent, Full Circle Organic. <br>  <br>  You could also start with Black Tea. I Love  PGtips!|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	You'll have to experiment to see what you like. Most start out with creamer and sweetener it seems. Hazelnut is good as far as flavorings go. There are many different types of coffee makers, from drip makers to pressurized espresso machines. I personally love a deep rich bold blend that knocks the stew out of ya! French and Italian Roasts are my favorite. Cappuccino is a good starter cup when at a restaurant.

yezbmlaKaa	You probably should answer the door. If a parent is home, she or he will most likely be arrested for providing alcohol to minors. A college admission and any sort of scholarship can and at some institutions will be revoked. If you are going to have a party, don't let it get out of hand. If there is reason for the cops to show up (too loud, too many people, etc) that you disturb your neighbors than you're probably going to end up in trouble. All underage guests will also - most likely - be arrested and charged with possession and consuming.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	Run!|`|QWY0P98Haa	Yes, you always answer the door for the police. If an adult is present, they will be arrested for contribution to underage drinking. All of the underage drinkers will probably also be arrested, taken in and their parents called. I couldn't tell you over a college admission. I can tell you that if the cops show up at an underage drinking party, it won't be pretty for anyone present.|`|3Ix5V01Jaa	no do not answer the door it is your right now to.  Yes it matters if the parent is home but then the parent is screwed if you open the door then they are charged with every underage, not just so a parent but even a someone who is 21  The party thrower is in bigger trouble they will loose there license for 3 months for underage and go to court for every underage person.  Yes a college admission can be revoked they have the option of doing so...depends on college...cops are ***** at all most all times... hope this helps|`|0OB7yhCKaa	whoever is 21 or over gets arrested for serving alcohol to minors and all others caught parents get called! and then your probly grounded haha so be quiet!!! lol|`|AUuUl8GOaa	f****** run dude.|`|lfKEHk66aa	1. Yes, it is best to open the door because this is the police you are dealing with and they will find a way in. Not opening the door could just result in more consequences. <br>  <br>  2. If parents are home they will get arrested for giving alcohol to underage people.<br>  <br>  3. Most likely this will be put on your record (a bigger chance of this if you were taking part in the drinking). It is likey a college admission could be revoked, or this will definetly lower the chances of getting into a college.<br>  <br>  **Please be careful. You can get into as much trouble as underage drinkers if you are only at a party with them, and not even drinking. Dont be pressured to drink, and if you are at a party where there is drinking, leave.|`|4gliQ2H9aa	If you live in the house then answer the door.<br>  <br>  If you cannot be traced back to the home then just run out the back door, I suppose you could hide in a closet for a few hours.|`|nHFBMXu7aa	if you are over 21.run!!!

Usually it's huge amount of hard alcohol (usually vodka and rum) mixed with different juices (like apple and pineapple). You definitely can get drunk off of Jungle Juice! It depends on how much alcohol is in the jungle juice and how high your tolerance is; anywhere between one and four cups of it should get you drunk.|`|n6NthDxwaa	jungle juice, trash can punch it's made w/ fruit and everclear or high percentage alcohol that's soaked overnight.

Normally bakeries will put a layer of buttercream under the fondant so before you give the cake to her take the fondant off. Fondant also conains glycerine, glucose and corn syrup which you should not give any child under two.|`|AA12270223	No...fondant is soft like a marshmallow!|`|xTm5hK4vaa	Fondant isn't as soft as cake, you need to chew it a little more, so if she can't chew I wouldn't get it.  If she can chew a little and will suck on it, she should be fine.  Fondant is basically a malleable form of sugar and it has better presentation than icing and professional bakeries have fondant that tastes really good.|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Personally, I'd ask the bakery to use a buttercream instead.  Although fondant is not hard, it is thick.  You can remove it (it doesn't taste all that great anyway!) and there should be a crumbcoat underneath that is buttercream.|`|4d80afe3510fcec9f8c8cce72cafd379aa	It's kinda chewy, but I think other people have given it to their one year olds before.  If your bakery won't use buttercream (which is just weird) you can peel the fondant off.

AA10224643	Try cooking them in a covered Pam sprayed skillet with chicken broth.  Cook them at medium heat until the internal temp is at 170 degrees flipping them as you go. I also add a little garlic powder, thyme, and rosemary directly to the breasts.  Add chicken broth as needed to keep them moist.  When they reach temperature let the broth steam out until the pan is almost dry to get a bit of caramelizing browning on the chicken.  My husband usually doesn't like chicken but he loves this.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Skillet is a good idea, as mentioned above.  Grilling outside is also great.|`|PgPW8nfKaa	Maybe if you try cooking it on the stove in a skillet with a little oil or non-stick spray just until its cooked (make sure you don't over cook it or it will get dry) and serve it over rice and your favorite vegetables|`|G9WJLBFWaa	Well for starters don't cook the chicken till 170 degrees. Meat and other foods continue to cook and go up in temperature after you take them off the heat. So the reason why your chicken is dry is because you cooked it till 170 and then it went up another 5 plus degrees. That is a recipe for jerky. 165 is the max temp you want chicken to be at so you should stop cooking it around 160. Trust me, as a professional chef, your food will be cooked safely. You can roast the chicken in the oven at 350-400 degrees or just cook it in a medium high skillet for 5-6 minutes on each side, depending on the size of the breast.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. <br>  2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. <br>  3. Add the heavy cream and frozen wild blueberries to the dry mixture and combine until a homogenous batter is formed. This step is best done with a wooden spoon. <br>  4.

Add the cold butter and mix at the lowest speed until the butter is the size of peas. Combine the eggs and heavy cream and, with the mixer on low speed, slowly pour into the flour and butter mixture. Mix until just blended. The dough will look lumpy! Combine the dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of flour, add to the dough, and mix on low speed until blended. <br>  <br>  Dump the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead it into a ball. Flour your hands and a rolling pin and roll the dough 3/4-inch thick. You should see small bits of butter in the dough. Keep moving the dough on the floured board so it doesn't stick. Flour a 3-inch round plain or fluted cutter and cut circles of dough. Place the scones on a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Collect the scraps neatly, roll them out, and cut more circles. <br>  <br>  Brush the tops of the scones with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are browned and the insides are fully baked. The scones will be firm to the touch. Allow the scones to cool for 15 minutes and then whisk together the confectioners' sugar and orange juice, and drizzle over the scones<br>  --

I always add a splash of olive oil and some salt to the water to prevent sticking and add flavor.     Brown your ground beef along w/ some chopped onions and garlic, once its browned you drain the fat (if there is any) and pour in the sauce. Lower the heat and let simmer, this would be the time to add veggies like zuccinni or mushrooms if you like.    While sauce is simmering water should be boiling, add pasta, cook about 6-8 minutes.     Once the pasta is cooked (it should be soft but not mushy) drain it, serve and pour sauce on top.

Place a medium dish in the oven to warm.   Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brush chops lightly with oil and place in hot pan. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, turning occasionally, or until done. Transfer to the warm dish, and keep warm in the preheated oven.   In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt and pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add butter to skillet, and stir in brown sugar mixture and apples. Cover and cook until apples are just tender. Remove apples with a slotted spoon and arrange on top of chops. Keep warm in the preheated oven.   Continue cooking sauce uncovered in skillet, until thickened slightly. Spoon sauce over apples and chops. Sprinkle with pecans.     Serve with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Try this. It's dead easy, and only uses a few ingredients. It even makes its own apple sauce, and the gravy from the juices left in the dish is absolutely delicious and, if course, goes with the pork perfectly. There is also nothing wasted. Also, casseroles like this can stay in the cooker for a bit longer than intended and not burn to a crisp.    PORK IN CIDER    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS    250ml of cider  1 apple  1 onion  2 pork chops or steaks    METHOD    Pour the cider into a measuring jug. Peel and core the apple, cut it into thick slices and put them into the cider to stop them going brown. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.    Put the onion in the bottom of an ovenproof dish with a lid. Put the meat on top. Add the cider. Arrange the apple slices on top of the pork. Put the lid on the dish.     Cook in a preheated oven at 150C, 300F, gas mark 2 for about 2 hours. Check the liquid level from time to time and top it up if it starts to dry out.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Stir 2 heaped teaspoons of gravy granules into the onion and cider left in the dish to make the most delicious gravy.     TIPS    Any cheap cider (that doesnt have the word white in the name) will do. The long, slow cooking in the alcohol tenderises even the cheapest meat.
1wNsBNmxaa	Chilling or freezing olive oil does no harm and the oil will return  to its normal consistency when warmed.    The ideal temperature to store olive oil to reduce oxidation but to avoid clouding  is around 50 degrees F.      To determine the actual freezing temperature I put some oils in the freezer with a thermometer. At 40 degrees most of the oils had not hardened or formed any crystals. At 35 degrees F most were firm enough that they could not be poured but were as soft as butter at room temperature. As the temperature lowered, more components of the oil solidified. At 10 degrees F the oils were hard enough that a fork could not penetrate them. Determining at what point to call the oil "frozen" is a matter of semantics. This slow increase in hardening as the temperature is lowered is in sharp contrast to a pure substance such as water which switches from a liquid to solid phase at an exact temperature.

xrRZeROmaa	usually a small white or navy bean    This a basic recipe snagged off line.  I usually cook mine in the oven at 200 degrees covered for several hours, sometimes overnight.  Just make sure there is plenty of liquid in the pot.  Cooked this way, the beans get a different texture, almost like candy.  Usually I add bacon or salt pork to the beans also.    Serves 6.  1 pound navy or pea beans  1 large onion, chopped  2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  1/4 cup dark brown sugar  1/3 cup light brown sugar  1/4 cup molasses  1 teaspoon salt, or to taste    1. Discard any discolored beans. In a large bowl, combine the beans with plenty of cold water and soak overnight for 6 to 8 hours.    2. Drain the beans. In a large pot, combine the beans and enough water to cover them by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to simmer, and cook for 45 minutes or until they are just tender (it may take longer if the beans are old or the soaking time was short). Drain the beans and set aside the cooking liquid.    3. Set the oven at 325 degrees. In a bean pot or deep casserole with a lid, combine the beans, onion, mustard, dark and light brown sugars, molasses, and salt. Add enough of the cooking liquid to just cover the beans. Stir to blend them.    4. Bring the liquid to a boil on top of the stove, then transfer to the oven and bake for 2 hours, checking every 30 minutes to make sure the beans don't dry. Add more cooking liquid if necessary.    5. When the beans are tender, uncover the pot and cook for 20 to 30 minutes more to make a slightly crusty top.|`|5SCMfucFaa	haricot i think|`|HKoo2PfYaa	Most commercial canned baked beans are made from haricot beans, also known as Navy Beans, and sold in a sauce.

(Sugar contains what they call "empty" carbs.)

Let sit for 20 minutes then drain in a strainer, pressing to extract the excess liquid. <br>  <br>  In a large bowl, blend the beef, onions, cumin, salt, and pepper to a paste. Add the strained bulgur wheat and mix well. Process again, in batches, in a food processor until smooth and pliable enough to work like a dough, adding a little ice water if needed. <br>  <br>  To make the stuffing, in a large skillet, cook the meat, stirring, over medium-high heat until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the onions, salt, allspice, pepper, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, until tender, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the pine nuts. Let sit until cool enough to handle. <br>  <br>  To make the final dish, with wet hands, shape the raw meat-bulgur mixture into egg-sized balls. Make a hole down the center of each ball with an index finger to make a deep cup with a pointed bottom. Stuff each ball with about 1 tablespoon of the stuffing. Press down on the sides and top to enclose the filling and reshape into a smooth egg with a pointed top. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, wetting your hands frequently. <br>  <br>  Preheat the oil to 360 degrees F. <br>  <br>  In batches, add the kibbeh balls to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and the meat is cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

YUM!|`|O2GRn8oOaa	i usually use a taco kit or seasoning in a packet with taco shells or soft taco. you brown the beef and drain add seasoning packet and water follow directions on packet or box. add lettuce tomato and cheese. if you want refried beans i usually get them in a can and heat them in the microwave and put the beans in the taco or tortilla first and or on the side|`|179bfac4a67bbbe55ad03b236d576653aa	Tacos and Burritos are a regular in my home. The best tacos use WHITE CORN tortillas. You can fry them for a short time in some oil (best if still soft enough to fold) OR if you want healthier, you can spray some cooking oil in your pan and just heat them a little. They are also really good if you use the same pan you cooked your meat in so you have extra flavor in the tortilla. When seasoning the meat, use Seasoned Salt, a little Garlic Powder, and some Ground Red Pepper (adds a sweet & spicy taste). I always put sour cream on my tortilla first, then the beans (refried are my preference), then the meat (maybe try cut up chicken breast for a change), then cheese, lettuce & tomatoes (if you like them), and choose a GOOD salsa (like La Victoria). : ) Yum!|`|YmwzubmFaa	mince in a tomato &basil sauce, <br>  jthat goes in the taco firls, then shredded lettuce, diced tomato, diced avacado, chopped cucumber then cheese and sour cream on top!|`|n6NthDxwaa	beef season w/ salt, pepper, garlic, onion, chili powder<br>  beans, same, but add ground cumin and a little cilantro|`|kjgonYlgaa	The pkgs of taco spice are easy and have directions on them.

AA11124473	I have tried several recipes for Red Lentil Soup. This is a combination/synthesis of a few of them. I served it at a dinner party and received lots of compliments!<br>  <br>  Ezogelin ?orbas? (Red Lentil Soup with mint and bulgur)<br>  <br>  1 Tb olive oil<br>  1 Tb margarine or butter<br>  1 large onion, finely chopped<br>  2 Tb dried mint<br>  1/2 Tb (1 1/2 tsp) dried thyme<br>  1 Tb paprika<br>  2 Tb tomato paste<br>  1 medium tomato, diced<br>  1/2 cup red lentils, heaping<br>  1/3 cup fine grain bulgur<br>  6-7 cups vegetable or chicken broth<br>  salt, pepper, and hot red pepper to taste<br>  <br>  Saute onion in oil and butter for 4 minutes. Add mint, thyme, and paprika and saute another 2-3 minutes. Add tomato paste and tomato; stir well to mix everything together for about 1 minute. Add lentils, bulgur, and 6 cups of broth. Turn heat to medium-high to bring to a boil, then lower heat to low and cook soup at a simmer/gentle boil for 30 minutes. Stir soup and taste. Add salt, pepper, and hot red pepper to taste, and adjust spices if you'd like. Cook another 10 minutes. If soup is too thick, add a bit more stock and stir well. Turn off heat. For best results, pour the soup through a collander and blend all of the solids in a blender or food processor for 3-5 minutes. This step is optional, but it improves the flavor and texture of the soup significantly.<br>  <br>  Notes: <br>  -Bulgur is available at many supermarkets, at health food stores, and at middle eastern shops. If you can't find it, you can use rice. Brown rice is closer in flavor to bulgur than white rice; if you use brown rice, though, increase simmering time by 15 minutes. You can also use couscous.<br>  <br>  -Some supermarkets don't stock dried mint. If you have trouble finding it, tear open a few mint tea bags.<br>  <br>  -If you like garlic, you can add 2 crushed or finely chopped garlic cloves at the same time as the paprika, thyme, and mint.<br>  <br>  -To make the soup look extra fancy, melt 2 Tb butter or margarine in a saucepan with 1 tsp mint and 1/2 tsp paprika. Drizzle a bit of the mixture over each bowl of soup. Try to make a little spiral pattern as you drizzle.<br>  <br>  -The soup stores well in the fridge for several days (it actually tastes better the next day, after flavors have blended thoroughly). It thickens up when stored, though, so you might want to stir in some water or broth when you're serving leftover soup.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|AA10923010	Since you failed to mention which type of lentils you wanted on this site there are lots of authentic turkish dishes.

a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	alot of these do nothing for me also- nausea and headache    fatigue is common in women and often has a treatable cause.  most common causes are anemia and hypothyroidism.    take care!|`|rUvaitfLaa	Yu may have a problem breaking down sugar, which would cause the caffeine to have an adverse affect, your body is wokring too hard to break it down and causes a "crash".  Or you just aren't getting enough rest in general.  Your body needs a certain amount of rest depending on your age, activity level, etc and no matter how much sugar/caffeine you consume you won't get energy.    Sometimes too, consumng too much caffeine/sugar, your body will crash signaling that you need to balance out your diet and get the recommended amount of sleep. And it's normal to feel sick if you consume too much caffeine.|`|qPaREyr2aa	You've probably drank so much caffeine in the past that your body has become neutral to the effects of it. If you go a few weeks/months without caffeine then have a few red bulls, you should feel it for sure!|`|afikdpZoaa	Have you tried massive doses of vitamins?    Could be you're low on Iron, vit. B, or C.|`|p2YwZuD5aa	What do you expect to happen to you when you drink these energy drinks or coffee? You should note that these drinks can be harmful for the body and that explains why you felt nauseous after drinking too much of them. You may be surprised, but the best drink is plain water. You should drink 7-8 glasses of water everyday - and that is all you need to fulfill your body's requirement for fluids. Juices, lemonade are additional drinks. Avoid aerated drinks, caffeinated drinks, alcoholic beverages (limit them to not more than one glass of wine, lets say per day - if you have to drink it). All these, including energy drinks have been documented to be harmful for the body. Some of these are supposed to have a "waking up" effect on you when you feel a fresh burst of revitalization after drinking them, but that is only because they drain the body cells of their stored energy. So, you may feel a temporary spark of energy, but after a while, your body will feel exhausted when the peak dies down.|`|xEJYJHECaa	Maybe your body is becoming desensitized to the stimulant ingredient.   Try laying off of all that stuff for a month or two and then if you need it again do so in moderation.|`|FBVw1ooraa	Do you drink a lot of caffeinated pop? Or even drinking as much coffee/ energy drinks now would make your body immune to the effects of caffeine. Your not being effected because your body has been effected to much from all of the caffeine..  Sorry!|`|DsZma16baa	I have the same problem. When ever I drink coffee or tea I just get tired instead of getting energy. I usually feel more energized (extremely hyper) like four hours afterward. With the one exeption where I drank half a cup of normal coffee and two expressos. Then I was really hyper right afterwards and had a massive headache. This is because caffeine affects every body's body in a different way. And every one takes a longer time for it to work if it works at all. I get really bad headaches if I drink to much but I don't really feel sick unless I don't eat anything before. I don't drink energy drinks though because they not approved by the American food and drug association because of all the chemicals in them. I also rarely drink caffinated soda.
5zNwBQZHaa	You cream butter and sugar together to incorporate air into the batter.  Having air bubbles in there will make your end product light and fluffy as the air bubbles expand in the heat.<br>  <br>  Complete details here: <a href="http://www.baking911.com/howto/cream.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.baking911.com/howto/cream.htm</a>|`|G9WJLBFWaa	You cream the butter and sugar together because those two ingredients take longer to incorporate into a batter then the flour, liquid, ect. Flour contains gluten which the more you mix it the more it develops. This is good for some breads but not cookies, cakes, and muffins. This is what makes things tougher and more elastic (as a dough). So, creaming helps you incorporate all the ingredients together with out over mixing your batter.|`|zQbpJmESaa	When butter and sugar are creamed together, the rough sugar crystals cut into the fat, creating air bubbles that are held in by it. These small air bubbles serve as a nuclei for leavening gases and steam. If the fat and crystalline sugar is adequately creamed, the entraped air is more evenly dispersed amount the fat leading to a better and more even rising.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	You usually cream ingredients such as butter, eggs and sugar. This just incorperates the ingredients well before adding the other ingredients.
zQbpJmESaa	BAKE THE MARINADE WITH THE TURKEY.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I lift it out of the pacakge and toss anything left behind.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	I would bake the turkey in the marinade.  In fact, I would spoon baste it a couple times while baking for flavor and moisture.|`|ffbdabbffdb4f137c60d520c03bfb483aa	marinades are meant for pree-cooking flavor, not really meant to be cooked.  Like someone said before me, just cook the tenderloin and ditch the excess liquid.  it will have PLENTY of flavor if it came marinaded in the package (probably been sitting in it for 2+ weeks or so)|`|G9WJLBFWaa	Discard the marinate. It has a high content of sugars that when heated and reduced will just burn and taste too strong. It is not the type of marinade that is meant for basting.
BWxSSADaaa	A previous answer is right in some aspect, although I don't agree that Tex Mex is gross.  When done well, it is very good, albeit different from real Mexican food (which is also available in some places in the States).  I would agree with what's been said about ground meat and tomato based sauces.  Real Mexican food also has a much greater variety of ingredients ... you more often see the use of fresh foods, like cilantro, avocado, lime, corn ... there's a lot of sea food (not talking deep fried fish tacos here) ... a lot of variety in what meats/parts are used (tripe, goat, pork, chicken, beef, quail).  Also, Tex Mex uses a LOT more cheese, and it isn't the white fresh cheese that is used in Mexican food, it's usually cheddar or some other yellow one.  There are some aspects of authentic Mexican food in Tex Mex, though.  Molé sauce, tomatillo sauce, tamales (although they can be different than authentic ones), grilled meats, tacos that aren't like the ones you get from taco bell, etc.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, they are both tasty.  I don't subscribe to the idea that something is automatically bad just because it's not "authentic."  I'm Indian and have had lots of unauthentic Indian food that is REALLY good.  I don't have to get offended about it, just enjoy everything.|`|AA10818931	Two people already answered your question so I'll answer the other one you asked. <br>  Common Mexican ingredients:<br>  Cilantro: a commonly used herb<br>  Meats: They use all parts of the animal, ground beef isn't very common.<br>  Peppers: They use many<br>  Sauces: Mostly pepper based<br>  Salsa: No vinegar, usually very simple.<br>  Beans: Pintos, mashed and fried<br>  Tortillas: Usually corn, bought or made fresh every day.<br>  Common Mexican Street Food:<br>  Tacos: tortilla, carne asada, cilantro,onions,salsa. THAT'S IT. Usually fairly small.<br>  Gorditas: Circle shaped dough stuffed with a sauce and meat or beans and cheese<br>  Tortas: Just plain sandwiches hot or cold, Not made with sandwich bread though<br>  Burritos: flour tortillas, beans,meat and sauce. THAT'S IT. and they aren't big, they are pretty small. 2 or 3 will fill you up.<br>  Tamales: Masa in a corn husk filled with sauce and meat.<br>  Enchiladas: Fried tortilla dipped in sauce and filled with cheese.<br>  Flautas: Tortilla rolled up with chicken inside then fried.<br>  Tostadas: Fried tortilla with beans on top<br>  <br>  Tex-Mex:<br>  Not spicy<br>  Tomato based sauces<br>  Huge burritos<br>  Chimichangas<br>  A lot is topped with wrong and too many vegetables. <br>  Way too much cheese.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Yes, it is something the gringos in the U.S. don't like to admit, but Tex-Mex is not good.  It is full of ground beef and tomato based sauces.  Real Mexican food is not made with ground beef (i've been to Mexico many times an never had ground beef!), and their enchilada sauce is not tomato based.  This Tex-Mex food is not really edible compared to the real thing.  I mean, c'mon, tamales made with ground beef?  <br>  Plus a packet of 'taco seasoning' does not a good dish make.   Know your herbs and use them accordingly, right?<br>  So many ppl giving out 'recipes' have all the gringo stuff in them and it is so totally disgusting that I'd never eat it.  Sorry to offend those who post such things, but perhaps a couple of visits to deep Mexico would give them a new lease on cooking.   <br>  Yep, no one's gonna like this answer, but it's true.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Tex-Mex food has a lot more meat in it than authentic Mexican food. I saw a program on the Food Channel about this.|`|UzpU2Sjvaa	Simple, one is Mexican and the other is Mexican American. Here is an example, ChimiChanga = Tex Mex. Mole = Oaxaca. It is hard to just classify mexican food because the country has different variations throughout mexico. You will never see food from oaxaca, puebla, yucatan or Tabasco style food in US. All you see is Mexican food from Northern States. But hardcore Mexican food, Menudo, Posole, Mole, sopes, etc...|`|vbAlVxtBaa	just tell them that saying taco bell is actual spanish food is like saying dominos is actual italian food|`|AA11091315	I love Gringo Mexican food. Yum!|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Mexican food is varied according to region, Tex Mex is the style you would find near and in Texas
VeDJa0m9aa	Yes, eat a little less than normal on Fri, early evening. It sounds like since you get only 3 flapjacks, it sounds  like a speed eating contest rather than 'how many can you eat' contest. If you can, bring your own syrup and make it a cheap thin syrup. It's the syrup that gets you full. My first flapjack contest...I was 16. My mom wanted to see who in the neighborhood could eat the most. So she kept cooking for all of us all afternoon. I won by eating 26! I am much older now and can eat just about 5 maximum now. I also tried a Mother Lode pancake once. It was so big, it hung over the edge of the plate. It had to be flipped with a shovel. Even though I requested a thin syrup, I still could not finish it, because my tummy is not as young as it use to be. Also, drink water, not milk. It won't fill you up as much. I'd love to know how this turns out for ya. Good luck!|`|J6UCHkeSaa	I'm sure they will provide water. If they do provide water use the chew chew swallow method.<br>  <br>  In other words chew twice then swallow. This will grind it up enough for your stomach to digest. Also don't try to fit the whole pancake in your mouth unless you have been practicing with pancakes prior to this event. The chew chew swallow method allows you to salvage space in your stomach. Remember the fable of the tortoise and the hare. Slow but steady!!! If you go slow but steady you spend less time trying to swallow more pancake like those who would shove the whole pancake in their mouth. If winning is dependent on the pancakes being gone the fastest and you can still be chewing then abandon the slow and steady. Be the hare!!!<br>  <br>  Have something light in the morning like a bowl of cereal or something. No Pancakes!!! This way you are not full but you're not starving either. If you're starving then you'll gorge on the first pancake and you're done for.|`|YmwzubmFaa	eat a little bit, on the day remember to chew properly so you dont get indigesgion|`|79qvnh1Xaa	You should but just a little bit.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	be careful with stuffing yourself, okay?<br>  <br>  try to eat very light the day before (like not much food or a lot of light small meals), then if the contest is in the morning, dont eat breakfast. if its during the day, eat a small breakfast. if its at night, eat light but til you get full. good luck :)
45N6tmWraa	It's not that the vitamin content increases, rather the food volume decreases when you cook it so that the vitamins per cup of food seem to increase.  The food is more "concentrated."  So are the vitamins.  For example, if you have a full pot of green beans, then you cook them, the pot is only about 1/3 full, so all the vitamins (or most of them) are retained in a much smaller quantity of food.
