If you are looking for a good cellphone, consider what is most important to you.  Do you want a small, thin phone?  Do you want a PDA, Smartphone, or a basic phone?  Do you want a Windows based phone, Mac based, Symbian based, etc?  How important is the camera?  Do you want it to be able to record video?  How many megapixels do you want?  Do you want a flip phone, slider, or candy bar style?    In my opinion, the Nokia E61 is a good low cost phone for surfing the internet, checking email, and text messages.  However, it doesn't have a camera.      The iMate Jasjam, HTC TyTN, or Cingular 8525 (all the same phones) are great pocket PC phones with WiFi, 3G capability, a keyboard, and a 2MP camera.  The camera is not all that great though.      The Nokia N73 has one of the best cameras on the market today.  It has a 3.2MP camera with image stabilization.  Plus, it is has small form factor for everything it can do.    The Nokia N93, while a huge phone, has a 3.2MP camera as well, it can record video in near DVD quality at 30 fps.  Plus, it has a Carl Zeiss lens.    Another great phone is the Eten X500m http://www.mobileplanet.com/p.aspx?i=140...  It is a PDA phone with GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and a 2MP camera.      For more options, check out www.mobileplanet.com.|`|da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	From what i've seen, the Nokia N73 lives up to its reputation with a 3+ megapixel camera, and the usual other features plus that of a PDA.  If you're looking for just a decent, not too expensive, phone.. the Samsung D520 and D500 models are top of the line, $250 AUD so i'd assume no more than $200 USD.  As long as you like your phone!   - Clarke.

If it is a Cingular phone, then they should be able to set it up for prepaid. My phone was Cingular b/c I originally had a contract with them. When I switched to prepaid, they told me at first that I'd have to get a different phone, but when I called that number they said they could set it up for me to work.

AA10954511	Yes, but don't do anything else untill you recover the images. The more you do, the harder to recover the pictures.    You can either buy a program, or get a free program, that looks at the memory chip and recover the files.  Realize when you delete a computer or camera file, it just makes the space available. The file is still there - until you use it again. That's why I warned you about not using the memory chip.    You can download a free program here.

AA10856937	The only advantage I can see for the Evolt 500 is the Four Thirds system, really.  You can use a Leica lens on the Evolt 500, or a Olympus lens.      At high ISO, I'd say any of the Pentax, Canon, or Nikon excel.  The sensor on the Evolt is smaller then the dSLR's from the others in the same class.  A smaller sensor will give you more digital noise in low light situations, where you'd use the higher ISO.    I think the Four Thirds system needs another year or two in market development before I'd trust it would be a stable platform.  It could very well go the way of the APS cameras, or even the Disc cameras from the 80's.    Personally, I shoot Pentax.  They don't have the limitation on using new or newer lenses since thier dSLR's are all compatible with all K-mount lenses.  That dude above who is dissing Pentax is blowing bubbles.  Name one other major camera suppier who not only has pro-quality dSLR's, and also medium format cameras.  Nikon, Canon, and Olympus do not have the advancements in optical quality or technology that Pentax has.  They have marketing, and that is about it.  It's like buying a Ford because everyone has one, but a Honda is a better car, and they have the technology to produce F1 race cars.|`|1d859e5cb7991fc81d7c69b2e56d3318aa	At high ISO, I believe Canon is superior with Nikon a step behind.  Canon;'s cleaning engine really churns out less grainy fotos at high ISO.  Nikon;s newest line of coolpix and the D40, D80, and D200 up are excellent.    No to Olympus and Pentax.|`|AA11484200	I'm enjoying mine.

Standing for "wireless fidelity", it was developed to be used for mobile computing devices, such as laptops, in LANs, but is now increasingly used for more services, including Internet and VoIP phone access, gaming, and basic connectivity of consumer electronics such as televisions and DVD players, or digital cameras.    A typical Wi-Fi setup contains one or more Access Points (APs) and one or more clients. An AP broadcasts its SSID (Service Set Identifier, "Network name") via packets that are called beacons, which are usually broadcast every 100 ms. The beacons are transmitted at 1 Mbit/s, and are of relatively short duration and therefore do not have a significant effect on performance. Since 1 Mbit/s is the lowest rate of Wi-Fi it assures that the client who receives the beacon can communicate at at least 1 Mbit/s. Based on the settings (e.g. the SSID), the client may decide whether to connect to an AP. If two APs of the same SSID are in range of the client, the client firmware might use signal strength to decide which of the two APs to make a connection to. The Wi-Fi standard leaves connection criteria and roaming totally open to the client. This is a strength of Wi-Fi, but also means that one wireless adapter may perform substantially better than another. Since Wi-Fi transmits in the air, it has the same properties as a non-switched wired Ethernet network, and therefore collisions can occur. Unlike a wired Ethernet, and like most packet radios, Wi-Fi cannot do collision detection, and instead uses a packet exchange (RTS/CTS used for Collision Avoidance or CA) to try to avoid collisions.'     A wireless network uses radio waves, just like cell phones, televisions and radios do. In fact, communication across a wireless network is a lot like two-way radio communication. Here's what happens:     1.A computer's wireless adapter translates data into a radio signal and transmits it using an antenna.   2.A wireless router receives the signal and decodes it. It sends the information to the Internet using a physical, wired Ethernet connection.     The process also works in reverse, with the router receiving information from the Internet, translating it into a radio signal and sending it to the computer's wireless adapter.     The radios used for WiFi communication are very similar to the radios used for walkie-talkies, cell phones and other devices. They can transmit and receive radio waves, and they can convert 1s and 0s into radio waves and convert the radio waves back into 1s and 0s. But WiFi radios have a few notable differences from other radios:     1.They transmit at frequencies of 2.4 GHz or 5GHz. This frequency is considerably higher than the frequencies used for cell phones, walkie-talkies and televisions. The higher frequency allows the signal to carry more data.     2.They use 802.11 networking standards, which come in several flavors:  -802.11b was the first version to reach the marketplace. It's the slowest and least expensive standard, and it's becoming less common as faster standards become less expensive. 802.11b transmits in the 2.4 GHz frequency band of the radio spectrum. It can handle up to 11 megabits of data per second, and it uses complimentary code keying (CCK) coding.   -802.11g also transmits at 2.4 GHz, but it's a lot faster than 802.11b - it can handle up to 54 megabits of data per second. 802.11g is faster because it uses orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), a more efficient coding technique.   -802.11a transmits at 5GHz and can move up to 54 megabits of data per second. It also and uses OFDM coding. Newer standards, like 802.11n, can be even faster than 802.11g. However, the 802.11n standard isn't yet final.     3.WiFi radios can transmit on any of three frequency bands. Or, they can "frequency hop" rapidly between the different bands. Frequency hopping helps reduce interference and lets multiple devices use the same wireless connection simultaneously.       As long as they all have wireless adapters, several devices can use one router to connect to the Internet. This connection is convenient and virtually invisible, and it's fairly reliable. If the router fails or if too many people try to use high-bandwidth applications at the same time, however, users can experience interference or lose their connections.     (note:-The 802.11 designation comes from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE sets standards for a range of technological protocols, and it uses a numbering system to classify these standards)
824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	The answer is obvious. Do you want free internet access? Don't you want to check out your myspace page from the palm of your hand? PSP you can , the ipod video you can't.    This means that you don't have to use internet service if your house, school, freinds  house are wi-fi hotspots. Many coffee shops and hotels give free internet service with their patronage and devices just like the PSP.    That's cool.|`|57269f2b955ed2b0dadf8abb04985b15aa	i think that ur question is out of d category, but ok.. i ever think of tat question too..

Verizon uses CDMA technology while Cingular uses GSM.     in order to get Cingular service you would neet to put the Cingular Sim card into the sim card slot of your Verizon phone.    That's not possible. If look underneath your battery, you will see their is no spot.

I'm not sure how the family plan buying process works on Amazon, though; but if you visit Cingular's or T-Mobile's website you'll see that.    Feel free to mess around on their websites and build your plans and phones; that'll allow you to see the monthly price and features.|`|QDB1UFWjaa	If your going with a new company, and since you'll be stuck in a contract, Id be suprised if they didn't let you get two phones for a discounted price.  Because they want your business. They make money on you having a monthly bill, not you buying the phone. I would go to a store for each provider and ask.  Or check their respective websites.|`|soebUPtmaa	yes you can get 2 different phones on 2 different lines both at a contract price w/ pretty much any company but honestly unless your not doing to good w/ verizon i would say call there cancellation dept and let them know you have better offers elsewhere and morethan likely they will offer you a discounted phone and maybe even rate plan just to keep you as a customer.|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	I've seen many cellular phone online stores. Every one I have seen allows you to get two phones as part of the family plan deal. But Many of the sites will allow you a maximum of two at the  heaviest discount price.       If you buy from a large retailer, they will generally give you discount for as many phones your credit will allow at the discounted price.
824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	If its a corporate office, they will activate it for you. They will try thier best to convince you to call the customer line, because they would rather sell phones than activate phones for other accounts.     Call first, and tell them to activate the new phone you purchased wherever you purshased it at. They will give you directions over the phone. YOur done.    If the directions they are giving are uncomprehensible then go the store and tell them that you already tried that method but wasn't able to do it. They will do it.|`|284fa228e570b35f8d8598d0f487deafaa	being someone who actually understands the question. yes you can buy a phone outside of your provider as long as the phone is setup for the same type of network that you are on. but it also has to be unlocked from the provider that it was intended for. now the question i impose on you is, is the $222 price a full retail price upgrade or a contract extension price? same with the $75 priced phone is that for a new contract or is that retail price that they are selling it for? if it is a contract price then if you buy it, you will have to pay an early termination fee on the contract which runs anywhere from $125-200 depending on the company.|`|46yp0phqaa	well, here are few tips. In your case Sprint is the company, now Sprint has two types of models with the SIM card (formerly Nextel mostly) and without the SIM card. If you are buying a phone model which is without SIM card, make sure it made for Sprint technology (CDMA/PCS if I am not wrong) and you can get that phone activated on your number. You can do this buy calling Sprint tech support or online if you have your online account on Sprint. but if you are buying a model which works on SIM card then you can buy any UNLOCKED cellphone from anywhere and use your SIM card in that unlocked phone and you are good to go.  Hope this helps....Good Luck!

Your phone could have been disconnected for three years, and you will still have internet connectivity options.      Places to get free wi-fi internet service are Public Libraries, Universities for its students, Hotels, and many coffee shops. Other places may charge you for wi-fi access.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	Most people who want to use the Walkie-Talkie service, want to use it with people on Nextel. Under the boost plans, 1 dollar a day will give you unlimited walkie talkie talking with either of these companies.

You should get one, it IS good quality =]|`|AA10903893	The newest Model of Fuji Finepix is the S100FS.    It is an 11.1 MP camera with  a 14.3x Zoom and claims to have ISO settings to ISO 10,000.    It is a solid camera, but at $800 (approximate street price), you would probably be better off getting an entry level dSLR camera.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Fujifilm announced 7 new models of camera in Jan. this year.  You can check them out in the link below. The F100fd would be the pick of the compacts, due to it having the larger Super CCD sensor. It costs $300+.  The good thing about this Fujifilm camera, is that it can also use SD memory cards (most Fujifilm cameras can only use the slower, xD cards). SD or SDHC is the better option.    For a better camera overall, look at one of Canon's ultra compact SD (Ixus) models with IS (image stabilizer).
AA10903893	That would be because the camera does not offer an option to record "just sound"  only VGA (15 fps) video with sound.
AA10903893	Make sure your USB cable is connected directly to the computer's USB port and NOT a USB hub.  (Many Hubs do not have enough power to charge the camera).    Ensure that all cables are properly in and secure.    Make sure you have the battery in correctly.|`|AA10683211	try pressing the reset button if theres a resetting button and try taking the rechargeable battery out and putting it back in again
AA10903893	Abe's of Maine is a reputable retailer and Canon authorized retailer.    The camera you purchased has a full Canon warranty.    Perhaps the price seems lower than you were expecting because Canon currently has an instant rebate program running (through mid July) that reduces the price of 40D by $200.
AA10903893	Nikon Coolpix P5100 gives you a solid 12 MP camera, good image quality and even the ability to use a real flash later if you want to purchase one.    The Canon S5 IS is another really good camera.  It is "only" 8MP but has a 12X Zoom that lets you take pictures that you couldn't get with camera that only sport a small 3x zoom.  This typically runs about $10 or $20 above your $300 limit though.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Best brands for that price would be Canon and Nikon.|`|WGYlzefnaa	Nikon CoolPix S550 - $200 - Fantastic Camera!!|`|XGvGa2L7aa	Try a site like newegg.com or tigerdirect.com and run a search with your price range and then align the column by popularity.    Good luck!|`|niorlq1xaa	I like cannon
AA10903893	I have an S5 IS for my "walking around" camera when I don't want to lug around a dSLR.  It is excellent for what it does.  The Zoom works well, and it takes decent daytime pictures.  The ISO gets very noisy at 400 and 800 though, so it is not great for a low light camera.  It does have a hot shoe though, so you can use a Canon Strobe on it for lighting and don't have to depend on the popup flash.    The Canon G9, which unfortunately does not have the "SuperZoom" is however probably the best Point and Shoot (in the sub $1000 range) on the market.  It has 12.1 MP of resolution, like the S5, has a hot shoe so you can mount a real strobe on it, but the G9 will also allow you to shoot RAW like a dSLR.
AA10903893	Step 1 - You already did by letting the battery die out and then recharging.    Step 2 - Try starting up the camera without the memory card.  If this works, reformat the card.    Step 3 - Contact HP.  There was a firmware update for this camera, but obviously you have to be able to boot the camera.  Also note, there appears to be a recall on this camera, which may or may not have something to do with the firmware update.  Ask your HP representative (when you get him on the phone) what the deal is with the recall, and find out if your camera is part of this recall.
3b27ebf29391e7721fca952e28185437aa	lord help you.    i have a sony cyber-shot as well, and i wil never purchase another one.     Mine is also broken, after having it for just two weeks.  I sent it back because it was still under warranty, but they refused to fix it.....well actually they said they would fix it for a fee of $193, and it was a $200 camera.    Total BS.     I'd say buy a new camera that isnt made by SONY =X    =/      _____________  i just read a post above me and DO NOT bring it to geek squad for $20.. If you are goin to send it to sony, just send it yourself.. Call them to find out where..  No middle man $20 fee.. and if it is goin to cost a lot to fix it and you dont want to pay you may refuse, and they'll send it back and it cost you nothin in the end..  (just a couple bucks to ship it to them)|`|SzJI2tIraa	you can take it to best buy geek squad and for $20 they send it to the manufacturer and then they tell you how much it is to fix if you accept then they fix if you dont they give it back but you lose the $20|`|KX4d8dSMaa	take it back to the shop and try to pay for a fixing, or go to a market and get a new lense|`|B2Fs9XwNaa	toss it and buy a new camera|`|32A5synzaa	i had the same problem  i had to end up getting a new camera.  but send it into the shop,  and if its under worrenty then it may be free.  hope this helps :]|`|03jr3e38aa	go to the store (best buy) any fix it!    orrrr....      put batterys in it!|`|ACSlwKeYaa	hit it with a bat
AA10903893	You would create this with Photo editing software.  Programs like Photoshop Elements have several types of "frames" built in, otherwise even basic (free) programs like Gimp will allow you to make the "canvas" bigger, and paint it white to create the "Polaroid Frame" look.|`|nxdvuT0daa	You have to compose two elements to achieve this effect    1) unfocused the subject manually or soften filter by photoshop.  2) change the color temperature or modify the colors in photoshop.  |`|nPQQLqUWaa	This is a scan of 600 type polaroid film. You can buy polaroid cameras and 600 film, but it is becoming more expensive and harder to find.     If you want to do this digitally, you could scan a polaroid at high resolution and then remove the image from the centre. You could then crop your digital photos and place them underneath the polaroid. (or if you've done a bit of PhotoShop, you could set up an action to do this automatically.)    Good luck.
n71t0xoCaa	OK A little more lens info would help. But the lenses used by the FG at the time it was made would have been the AI, AI-s or E series lenses. These lenses will mount and take photos on all of the Nikon DSLR but will not give you all the features.     Theses lenses will not autofocus on any DSLR    They will meter and funtion in A and M mode on D200, D300, D700 Di, D2 and D3 though on the D1 it will not matrix meter it will only centerweight and spot meter. They are probably not G lenses so make sure the lens aperature is set to the smallest aperature usually f22 and set the aperature from the camera body.    On all the other Nikon DSLR they work in manual mode only with no metering so you have to use the sunny 16 rule or an external meter.    It is possible if you bought some of the lenses later to use on this camera that you got AF lenses even though this camera did not autofocus   I hope this helps|`|AA10903893	The Nikon FG uses the standard Nikon F mount, so lenses that fit the FG will fit on a Nikon dSLR.  If the lenses are as old as the FG.|`|3TqPF1zMaa	It would be better to investigate the compatibility of the lenses themselves, since you could possibly own lenses of different technologies. Generally, you will get at least some functionality from mounting a Nikon lens to a Nikon camera, even if it's just manual-use only.    You'll probably be most interested in the D200, D300, D700 series of Nikon cameras which give great compatibility with older lenses.    Ken Rockwell has an excellent page on this topic.    Disclosure: I am the owner of http://www.lenslenders.com in Canada.   
ada38d40b8a478e4e22c3765f3ad91e9aa	There is not a lot to choose from on the Internet when it comes to "live" TV. And certainly nothing like what you would get from a dish or cable service. Mostly what you would have is recorded shows that you can have stream to your PC. Take a look at hulu.com and joost.com to see what they have. That should give you a good idea of what to expect. There's some good stuff there, but not enough to get rid of your regular TV service. You might get a lower regular service and supplement with the Internet.   If you have several TVs, you'd probably want a PC for each, and a really good Internet connection. I suppose you could set up a video server with several outputs, but that would be rather expensive.   You need a PC with a video out to hook up to the TV. If it doesn't have one now, you can get a video card that has one, to be ale to hook it up to the TV.

K1a8Haa3aa	It's a terrific phone, actually. Yes, all the apps you can download really makes it pop, but the phone functions are top notch. the touch screen is very responsive, and when dialing, I have never had a problem. The coolest thing is how easy the firmware updates are, and sometimes Apple will have updates that actually improve the iPhone's performance on the network.     The irritating little things that are always brought up:  - no MMS support (you CAN "email" the recipient's phone email address though, i.e. 2165551212@mms.verizon.net and it comes through fine as an MMS)  - no forwarding of text messages  - device can freeze if you're doing a ton with it (simple restart fixes it though)  - no way to easily remove/replace battery   - no stereo Bluetooth (A2DP) support  - speakerphone stinks for music (BlackBerry Bold is AWESOME, FYI)    Bottom line is this: I have used dozens and dozens of phones in the past few years, and iPhone 3G wins my heart as my favorite phone... EVER|`|x7vrxjcIaa	i heard that you cant take video's on it you can only take pic's you can watch video's on it but you cant take them         i coud be wrong tho|`|dJrVejLEaa	iphone is a very good phone  basically its a smart phone and has a hell lot of applications  although the cost of the phone is much higher than the phones with similar specifications   but it is from apple man.  you gotto admit style and brand value when it comes to apple.|`|Asvd9Vp5aa	It's a great phone.  There's honestly nothing that bugs me about it.  It's a lot of fun!
ZWaRNMzVaa	break ur fone or something................thats wat my friend does so she can get a new fone
AA12116276	I've used a pair of Sony neckbands for almost two years now. I find them comfortable and very durable. I've had headphones break into pieces before--these will not. Sound quality is excellent, and they stay in place during physical activity. With about 20 years of using various headphones and earphones, I'd say these are the best I've ever had.     I think they are called the MDR58V street style headphones. I know they have some on amazon for less than $100 but still pretty costly. You might look on other websites and see if you can find them cheaper (they are probably too old to find in stores).

EDIT: well go to the website and see if they offer an option if you didn't get a warranty. sorry thats all i've got.|`|DapWZJ5Maa	This is happening to my zune too. I think all zune like that. Hope they can get fixed soon|`|KuPshIjcaa	This is a problem with the 30GB series of the Microsoft Zune only, and it's fixable i'm thinking.  As long as it happened on the beggining of the New Year, then the problem is the way the Zune's clock driver handles a leap year, I guess it's confused? haha  I've done some digging and found some articles including the support topic from the Zune officials itself.  Hope this fixes your problem!      Happy New Year! :)|`|HOidPP1Faa	Pull off the cover and reset it by pulling the battery cable on and off. Don't sync it again until Microsoft releases an update, though. Solution is here:|`|Qy0OsgiLaa	I'd suggest you don't do anything.

AA10903893	Obviously this shouldn't be happening if the camera is really empty.  The easiest way to ensure there are no pictures on the camera is to not include the memory card you used when you sell the camera. (If you promised a memory card in your sale, pick up a cheap replacement card and substitute the new card in place of the one you have been using).    If you want to ship the card you currently have in the camera I would suggest rather than just deleting the files that you format the card.  This won't guarantee that somebody can't get the files off of the card (they could use a recovery program to restore the files) but this way the new owner won't just "find" files remaining on the card.

VMVW3E7Aaa	You have a VERY nice little camera there, but being a Point&Shoot, it does still have the same old limitation in low light situations.  You really need to read the manual - why don't you simply download the electronic version of it ??????    Read the manual, practice, read it again, practice some more. You'll be very grateful you did.    Make sure you have a tripod, use the 2 second self timer and if you're forced to use the onboard flash, rig up (or buy) a little diffuser - full on flash photos look awful.    Good luck with it all.|`|AA10903893	The S5 can take pictures at ISO 800 and 1600, but is really not acceptable above 400 (and some would say ISO 200).  This leaves you with two options for good quality images in low light.     1.  Use the built in flash.  It will work, but not the most flattering flash, and is prone to giving you Red-Eye Photos.    2.  Buy a flash to use in the hot-shoe.  One of the S5 features that makes it stand out is the ability to add an external flash.  You don't need the latest and greatest so you should be able to pick one up fairly inexpensively.  This will allow you to use a flash without as much dramatic shadows or red-eye as you would get with the built in flash.    Be sure to set your white balance accordingly (depending on the type of lighting) when you get there, and if at all possible, practice ahead of time.    Shoot, shoot and shoot some more.  Make sure you have a big enough (or more than one memory card).  Take multiple exposures on everything you shoot.  This will improve your odds of getting some good shots even if some others come out blurry.  
AA10568066	Get the iPhone with a red gel wrap.  This way you will have a cutting edge phone and the red color. Additionaly, you will not need the Nano, so directly donate that money towards AIDS Africa relief to Global Fund.  Same as Product Red though I would prefer UNICEF because it is a more direct route with your money.  Less money going to "business overhead" and less chance of fraud.    I've always believed a direct donation is much better than through a product.  This way you know how much money is actually helping and not a vague number that could be as low as .01% of the wholesale price (or just think pennies).    Problem solved!    .|`|MkqgeUkHaa	I wouldn't get the red RAZR, I have a pink razr and it can't do anything compared to the new phones. Why don't you get a newer phone and put a skin or a plate on it?|`|Rh1N63vXaa	I really don't think you should get it. Just because it is old just as you said but also that they are easily broken my cousin and I also had RAZRs but the screens broke by us accidentally dropping them or laid on them.

(direct quote.)
8XGdQywPaa	I usually go to www.dpreview.com whenever I'm confused with the camera brands/models.    In it, the latest cameras are rated by professionals and every single tiny detail of each & every feature is provided. At the end they also give a conclusion report and whether they recommend it or not.    Good luck with your decision :))|`|2M06uSEbaa	Do you need the ruggedness the camera offers? If you don't take pictures in extreme conditions, look for other cameras.|`|AA10929465	That's not the greatest compact digital camera.  The reason it's so much money is because of it's durability (shockproof, waterproof...).  If you are planning on taking it with you snowboarding or waterskiing, it's probably the only camera you should get.  |`|AA10903893	It is a good camera for what it does.  You are paying a premium to allow you to shoot in wet and/or dusty conditions (as well as being rugged).    If you don't need that extra protection, then it may not be worth it to you, but otherwise it is nice to be able to take pictures by a lake (or even IN it), or other such conditions where you would be worrying about damaging a lesser camera.    As for waiting, that can be an endless game.  What exactly would you be waiting for?  There is always "something better" just around the corner, but if this camera suits your desires, then I wouldn't wait (except perhaps waiting a couple of weeks to see what if any price drops may occur with holiday sales).
AA10903893	This camera was released December 2007, so it wouldn't be all that surprising to see a price drop this holiday season, though due to the fact that it has 4GB storage on board, I am not sure how much it will come down before it just is removed for a newer model (DSC-T300).    Whatever camera you choose, I suggest you get it with enough lead time so that you can get used to using it, and know its features well before you head off to Europe (also be sure to have an adapter to charge it during your trip).
AA10903893	Is this a new card or an old one that has stopped working?    If it is a new card, how big is the card?  This is an older camera, and will not support newer SDHC memory.    If it is an older card, you can try formatting it on your computer and see if the camera can read it then.  (If this does work, before you take any pictures, reformat the card again IN CAMERA).  Also, if this is the case, the card may be on the way out, and you may wish to consider picking up a new card.|`|Lkb16Fwtaa	The card my be corrupt. Have you tried using a different card? I also agree with the previous person, if you have a HCSD and an older camera it won't work, you'll need a regular SD card. Sorry it sucks doesn't it?

Until it breaks.  Then it's a real decoration on your dresser because LG won't fix it.  If you read the support section of the LG website, you'll read nothing but problems with the phones locking up, turning off, screen going white, stop charging, etc.  If you get one, be prepared to buy another one within 6 months!!  So I'd pick the Samsung!

6532e7bb93f79f7b7bbc9eb89e6704baaa	I really love mine. it works really well. I have sprint so I can watch sprint tv on it and listen to streaming music(when i have a good connection) and I can convert videos from  my computer and watch them on my curve. The email is very easy to set up. no matter how you get your email, you can get it to come straight to your curve. My main problem with the email and the web is that you cant see the emails and websites exactly like you would on your computer. I understand that's a tall order on a mobile device, but that's what I want, and an iPhone is not practical for me now.  texting is really easy, but I am getting used to the small keyboard, as I used to have an LG Rumor which has a large slide out keyboard. Other than those few things, it's a great phone and I think I will finally be happy with my phone for a while.|`|rTiX1V2Iaa	I love it.

uFOmjlDhaa	You can go to any electronic store and check theirs out. If you go to Circuit City (they are closing all their stores), you can find some good quality buds for affordable prices (35% off?). So yeah. If you're comfortable shopping online, check out Nextag or Overstock. I saw the buds from apple, and geez, they look painful. I couldn't deal with something that goes deep in my ear like that, but yeah, good luck.    Edit: Oh, well since you live in India, do you they have electronic stores where you are as well? If so check there, but for convenience I guess you might like shopping online?|`|fUXfkXe5aa	my favorite are the skull candy ear buds  19.99 at radio shack, wal mart, target, best buy.  they are great for the low, bass sounds  and better than the stock apple headphones for the mid range and highs, but aren't top notch.  honestly the best headphones ive ever found for 19.99  they have 3 sets of rubber in-ear attachments, so you will find one to suite your ears.

Ur6H8gwkaa	The number is almost meaningless. The only thing you can do is use it to compare different panels within the same brand name. And even then, the number will only tell you that one panel has a higher contrast ratio than another.    Real contrast ratios are nowhere near 10,000 to 1, or 20,000 to one. Anyone that posts that is only showing that they know nothing of how all this works.    These ultra high numbers are there to sell TVs, just like megapixels and cameras.    Go here, scroll down http://reviews.plasmatvbuyingguide.com/p...    A shootout between two very good plasmas. A true contrast ratio measurement is made. The truth is, a good plasma will deliver between 500 and 900 to 1. Nothing like those huge numbers huh?    I've seen a Pioneer Kuro can go beyond 1,000 to 1. Also stated in the article, that a good LCD can only deliver about 250 to 1 contrast ratio.    If you are looking at a LCD TV, the contrast ratio will be closer to 250, than anything in the thousands.    So to answer your question, if a given panel had a true ratio of 1500 to 1, yeah it would be great, but it probably doesn't have anywhere near that CR.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	I have both a television and a projector with that contrast ratio.  I looked it up when I bought it and in comparison to all the other kinds out there, 1500:1 is not on the top of the list.    You will see a big difference if you look at the TV on in the store next to one with a much higher contrast.  But when you take it home, you won't know the difference.    The straight answer is no, 1500:1 is not a 'good' contrast ratio.  But it is most definitely good enough.|`|qpOrgpV5aa	eh, you could have better. 20,000:1 to 50,000:1 is average hdtv contrast ratio|`|p7BjjPtNaa	No, you'll want something a lot higher|`|iLTlJszaaa	No.  Traditional CRT televisions (and not just the new ones) typically have at least 20,000:1.  They are usually the best for contrast.

LBP is good but once you complete story mode which isnt that long, and enjoy playing in some levels online, and maybe even create 1-2 of your own levels you will get tired of it.    Its a good game, but wont be able to match Killzone 2|`|f6a54fe6f7ac11afebbdef637114de3faa	If I were you, I would definitely pick up Killzone 2. It has a full story mode and online play as well. But just to let you know, LBP and Killzone are two TOTALLY different games. If you shooter-type games, go for Killzone. If you like     If your thinking that you need to play Killzone 1 before playing this, you don't. Basically, the story is that an evil group of people from an evil planet invades a good planet. If you want to read the story in-depth, click here:    Killzone 1's plot: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone Pl...    Killzone: Liberation's plot: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone:_L...    Killzone 2's plot: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone_2 ...    Little Big Planet does have online support and you are pretty much right. The Campaign mode basically has no story and seems similar to a game like Super Mario World where you go to different worlds, play levels from that world, and then go somewhere else.|`|RTQZKJsHaa	Killzone 2.  The replay value will be immense.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	It has a rather sweet story mode, although the online features are by far the best aspect (or creating levels which can be either tedious or extraordinary, depending on how much you enjoy that sort of thing).    Online takes the game to a new level. Some of the things created by other users are astounding (and absurdly complicated if you have seen the calculator) or various other game tributes, such as a rather beautiful Silent Hill level.    On top of all the online content, you an also play (somewhat) cooperatively with other people to unlock things.|`|RXSaV7l1aa	i dono, just choose|`|pl2SocVKaa	well lbp is good not a long story mode but online makes up for it but i actually think kilzone 2 will be better it will have a 10 hour campaign and i think a better online the best online on ps3 so i recommend that over lbp

o8NVWaJgaa	There is a baseball game for the Wii with Mario, Super Mario Sluggers, which totally basically makes baseball look like a game of hopscotch to them. It is pretty good, due to the amount of characters and 8 or so fields, but rent it first to see if you like it. It also lacks in difficulty though, just to warn you.  There is also another baseball game, forgot the title, that is only $20.00. But is is really bad. Even for that much for a game like that, its still a rip off. It basically takes baseball as we know it, and screws it up as bad as possible with minigames during the game, such as ........break the pinata!? I suggest you don't buy the game I'm talking about, sorry still don't know the title, don't even rent it.|`|5bViDPxVaa	well you can play wii sports for baseball and if your a mario fan, super mario baseball (i think this is the name of it)
rTlWyR6eaa	Combat Arms and War Rock are okay, and Cross Fire just went into open beta.    As far as the Army not being a good idea:  For undisciplined fatbodies and people too stupid to tell which end of a rifle goes towards the enemy, you're right.    However, for a lot of people it's a very good idea, especially in this economy.  People always need Soldiers, so there is some pretty good job security.  You can also retire at 20 years.  There are good health and education benefits, tuition assistance is 100% now.  While on active duty you tend to have a lot of disposable income, too.  Housing and food is paid for, so you don't have many bills to worry about.|`|5xcVQfcpaa	combat arms|`|Xxviy63Paa	People play:    Legends  Savage battle for Newerth  Wolfenstein Enemy Territory  World of Padman  Warsow (lots of people on this one)  Assault Cube  America's Army    Not so many people play:  Sauerbraten  Smoking Guns  Cube  Tremulous  Enemy Territory Fortress  True Combat Elite    But they are all free, and all decent. I expect America's Army is probably the most commercial-looking, but it's not the best by a long shot. It also may trick you into thinking joining the Army is a good idea. It's not, unless you can't get a better job...

HFuI8oVYaa	Digital Camera: Uses a two dimensional light-sensitive electronic sensor. Information from the sensor is converted from an analog voltage level to digital. Image information is stored on a digital memory device.    Conventional Camera: I assume you mean a film based camera. The image is formed by exposing a piece of celluloid coated with light sensitive coating. The film must be processed in chemical baths to render an image.     Scanner: Uses a one dimensional light-sensitive electronic sensor. The other dimension(s) is done by mechanically moving the sensor over the object to be imaged. Information from the sensor is converted from an analog voltage level to digital. Image information is stored on a digital memory device. This is a low cost way of producing high resolution images. Typical uses are scanning documents, photographs taken by a film camera, photocopiers, and satellite imagery.    As for software, a film camera process needs no software. Digital cameras and digital scanners use all sorts of software and firmware. Depends on what you are trying to do.     From a user standpoint, most people use photo editing software, such as Photoshop, to edit their images from digital imaging sources. There are specialty software packages that will do fun things like image stacking (astrophography), HDRI, focus stacks, and panorama stitching.|`|vZMN82U8aa	dcam stores images on a memory card...  35mm camera uses film.    scanners use either their own software, or most scanners can be read by photo imaging software like paintshop pro, or photoshop.|`|d55HYaktaa	Film has more dynamic range (less highlight clipping), and it is better for long exposures. A film camera may work fine for decades.    Digital sensors is better at high-ISO, and it does not requires filters for white balance. But it may be replaced every 2~3 years due to obsolescence.    Since the film will be scanned... the same softwares may be used for digital RAW and for scanned films, like Photoshop.
qaPyaFUcaa	Yeah it doesn't show up on a channel, it shows up on Vid1 or Vid2.

I know the guys very well and I'm sure they'd have no issue with simply posting the Video and DVD back to you.    Details: -     Glasgow Camcorder Centre  717 Great Western Road  Glasgow G12 8QX    Website - http://www.camcordercentre.com/    Telephone - 0141 339 3722    Just give them a call and ask how much they would charge. Speak to either Colin or John, I've dealt with them for years and their service and advice is 2nd to none.    Good luck.    Boris
8AYA5gTBaa	There is no current film that will work in your camera.    The Colorpack 80 uses the old square format packfilm, which has not been made in some time (2006). Unfortunately, you can't use the new Fuji packfilm in your old camera either.    You can find info about your camera and the film it used at the Land list website:  http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/landdca...|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	hard to find this stuff. google it. good luck|`|AA12180617	Polaroid stopped making instant film cameras 2 years ago and only continue to make instant film for the the last few series the colorpack series are too old for current film availability and if you do find any its likely to be way out of date.    This is an modern antique now rather than a usable camera (also the pictures you did get were of bad quality compared to normal film camera).|`|QoRC2JkLaa	I'm not sure what film you need but if its Polaroid 600 film there is a good deal on the website www.adessoalbums.com.

w4I9oj2Maa	It's not that HARD and you're a MAN...Read the instructions included in your Customer information book...The Lamp door is on the Back or the Left side on most Samsungs and Mitsubishis....and on the Front (behind Sony cover panel) or Right Side on Sony TVs...    The booklet is better...    You can order the lamp with a credit card and get it shipped direct to your home...    You can do it yourself...Save $110 to $140.    And...you DON'T have to WAIT for them.
AA12180617	the current software for th any iphone is 2.2.1.    also edge is NOT an network is a way 2G Phone networks exchange data (so is GRPS), you will never get the 3G symbol to show as this is NOT a 3G phone only a 2G one.    you only get EDGE when you have a valid SIM inserted and the number active. edge is NOT a feature its a network transmission method. you do NO subscribe to EDGE its not activated in the phone it only shows when the tower has the EDGE feature on its 2G network AND you have a valid SIM with an active phone account on it.     also your friends ID and psssword would be unique to his account!!    This is nothing to do with the iphone as such but you not having an active SIM inserted. (needs to be an O2 UK sim)    update the firmware by attaching it to itunes and an internet connection.

If you use your xbox daily for about 2/3 hours a day.. the xbox will last at least a year... but probable that it will break eventually... good thing is they give you a free fix anyway...|`|4Pk6VNftaa	So long as you don't do anything stupid with the unit, like move it around while it's turned on, you shouldn't have any problems.    Early models did have a problem with overheating but that's been fixed for some time now.  The current 360 models on the shelves should be quite reliable.|`|eQAEnmOPaa	NO.

VMPXFLqRaa	HI it depends. if its a 2g or 3g. You really dont need to get an att sim card. but if u can get more details i can help you with your unlock. i have unlocked over 100 iphones. and this is my business and will help u in any way i can..    send me an email if u like at terin_sap@yahoo.com      all u need is 2 -3 software downloads and you will be set with an unlocked iphone|`|V1O7N02saa	No. You would need a SIM though, just to test if it worked properly preferably not one from AT&T (as the iPhone is set to work on that either way).  You'd need to jailbreak it via QuickPwn & then download yellowsn0w via Cydia & then use that to finally unlock it.  Then you could use that non-AT&T SIM to ensure it worked properly.|`|RCdm5LzAaa	you can unlock it via sim card attachment:  http://www.gsmunlocklabs.com/unlock-ipho...|`|tEOXLJo5aa	I'm not sure AT&T lets you without a special circumstance. It seems to be much easier to get an unlocking code for other carriers.
AA11525080	You said laugh and laughing , Do you mean launch and launching?
COh882Pxaa	First you have to import the music from the CD, which involves converting it to a format suitable for iPod.    If you're using iTunes, when you load a CD it will ask you if you want to import it, and you can simply choose "yes" there. If that dialog doesn't pop up, you can just click on the CD in the device list, and "Import CD" in the bottom right corner.    Once the music has been imported to mp3/aac, you can go to it in your library and sync it to your iPod or drag and drop it onto your iPod if you manually manage it.
uRGRsdsyaa	sorry to say it, strat a new game?
L0OyvCYkaa	no it will void your manufactures warranty.  if you want to do it, do it after the warranty has expired.  any game that is downloaded is a breach of copy write.     not gonna judge you if you do it tho :D|`|1HtTxOOQaa	It's legal if you yourself are unlocking it and you have the persons consent.I mean, it's his Wii cause he paid for it and the company has no right to file a legal case over the guy or you cause the thing doesn't belong to them(It did, but you paid for it and bought it for them). But, they still have the right to void the warranty cause you have tampered with the thing. As long as you don't sell the games and do everything at the users consent everything is legal.    P.S:The guy who says jailbreaking ipod touch is illegal is also wrong cause again you are doing something to a gadget that you have bought and it completely belongs to you. All the company can do is void warranty.|`|v0aMGO4Oaa	Its not legal anywhere. I'd be careful.|`|GZfzVRykaa	it illegal, however so is jailbreaking ipods, downloading songs and pirating DVDs. Because all these things are done on a mass scale its very hard for the authorities to act apon, and therefore they dont really give a ****. They arent gunna come to ur house  and do a spot check, they may get word of a person or company that is un locking them and they may shut them down.    if things of these nature arent done by one person on a mass scale the n u should be safe, just be careful    hope this helped mate|`|9roHz7ZTaa	Yes, it is illegal.|`|nh0Vs91maa	Go canada.

AA11541003	Purchasing a new phone is not going to correct your problem. You are correct that Cingular does not have service in Wyoming. If you are making or receiving calls it is on another company's  tower with which Cingular has an agreement with. There in lies another problem. If you make more than 40% of your calls on another providers network ( or in your case 100% in Wyoming ) Cingular will cancel your account. You can verify this in the terms and conditions on the contract you signed or with Cingular customer service @ 1-800-331-0500. The reason for this is that Cingular has to actually pay an agreed upon amount  to that company every time you use their towers. I hate to say it but, you should probably look for service eleswhere.     ----->Don't forget to choose me for best answer!|`|71aa0347efe08211c692c9614a6e8901aa	You can get a new phone but if you have Cingular and you have static with the phone you have most likely you will still have static even on a different phone. I had Cingular up until about a year ago and I had the same problem. Even got a totally different phone and still didn't help. I live in Missouri and static was bad here too. It must be Cingular. Now I have Sprint which I accually like. Good luck, whatever you choose to do.|`|AA12220993	Yes sir. Buy your phone... Call Cingular Up. Give them the number on the SIM or the ESN from the phone..... Program your number in the new phone. You'll be all set. Check with Cingular first to see if the phone is compatible with their network.

For example, Cingular has a link where you can send a text message over the internet, and it will go directly to the recipients phone. Fair warning though, the recipient will not be able to respond to the text message.|`|AA11109801	AC-PHONE@TELEFLIP.COM SHOULD DO IT - EXAMPLE - 214-555-1212@teleflip.com
dfb256825919883d88dc22d7a4bc565eaa	There is one issue that is well known with porting a number from one service provider to another. Usually what happens is that your old phone will continue to receive your calls, but cannot make any outbound calls. Your new phone would make the outbound calls, but not receive any.   If it's been longer than 48 hours, call your provider.
fc806053ede1241063df565a78239fecaa	All Motorola phones require SIM cards. If you don't have one in your phone, it is not going to work for anything...games, camera, calls...nada. That is where the phone's memory is. So if your card is missing, you need a new one to be able to use the phone. You should be able to get one at a dealership, or off the internet. If not, you can come get one from me! But seriously, the phone is useless without the card. There is no 'getting past' the screen. Sorry.|`|354fb11342bceed76f11fcbf7732a7afaa	I don't know antying about getting past that screen. But if you turn it over, take off the battery cover. The sim card should go under taht metal band on the bottom right. Just about 2 mm below the battery.|`|AA12260873	open the back and look under the battery. if you see a small square card the you can remove it has one. if not it doesnt|`|b9daba895c0899d6764bacc1aed7264faa	Open up the battery compartment and you can tell if there is an empty slot where the SIM card should be.|`|6c3fc6cfc51df3231a3a5c49c305b6a1aa	I agree..... it is supposed to be under the battery, sometimes they have a small flap covering them so they don't get wet, or whatever.

AA11541003	Yes it is!!! Any bluetooth is compatible with any bluetooth enabled phone.

It should work.|`|AA10411569	Well, I guess the big question is: is the phone bluetooth compatable? You didnt list the model of the phone, but assuming that the phone is, the answer is yes. Any bluetoothe capable phone will work with the hs850. all you have to do it put the headset into pairing mode by closing the flip, and holding the answer/hangup button untill the blue light stays on. Then go into the connection settings on the phone, turn on the bluetooth, and search for new devices. Once it finds the headset, put in the password, (0000) and the two will connect. By the way, if the phone isnt bluetooth, you can still get an adapter to convert the phone to bluetooth capable.

AA11541003	I am assuming that since you asked this question in the "mobile phones and plans" section, you are actually asking about removing sounds and screen savers from your mobile phone?!? Anyway... This really depends upon what type of phone you have, but it is usually very easy. Just find the file and look at the bottom of your screen for an "options" or "more" or "menu" or something like that. Select it and there will be an option to delete the file. Some phones also have a "clear" button and pressing that while the file is selected will usually also do the job. If you let me know what specific phone make and model you have I can probably walk you through it. Good luck!!! :) Don't forget to choose me for best answer! :)|`|AA10222434	you have to go to the control panel, go into add or remove programs, then you select the designated item you wish to remove.

9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	Bell n?o inventou o telefone         Pouca gente sabe mas, Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) n?o foi o inventor do telefone e sim o pobre imigrante italiano Antonio Meucci (1808-1889), nascido em Floren?a. Este fato foi oficialmente reconhecido pelo Congresso Nacional dos EUA em 15 de junho de 2002, encerrando um longo perodo de 113 anos de controvrsias.    Entre 1850 e 1862, Meucci construiu cerca de 30 tipos diferentes de telefones, mas n?o tinha dinheiro para registrar patentes dos inventos. Na poca, cada patente custava algo em torno de US$ 250. Era t?o pobre que em 1870, quando ficou doente, vendeu um dos primeiros prottipos dos seus "teletrofones" por mseros US$ 6.    Em 1874, Meucci mostrou alguns dos novos modelos que concebera ao vice-presidente da Western Union Telegraphs e dois anos depois foi surpreendido ao ler nos jornais sobre a grande "cria??o" de Bell.    Em 1887 a justi?a chegou a anular a patente de Bell mas como o nico documento que citava a inven??o do italiano era um modesto registro em cartrio datado 1871, os juzes consideraram que a anula??o n?o poderia ser sustentada.    Meucci, que teve tudo para ser uma das maiores fortunas dos EUA, morreu pobre na cidade de Nova Iorque.|`|81a86ae7c209695e612b00a4e1fc5078aa	o meuci era tcnico e o gran bell o inventor|`|619354586df0220a791f983a64b31a3daa	Nenhum, Rutinha, foi a TELEMAR!!!|`|ce57c677993189706af7b0302784d7dfaa	Deus que criou o homem, depois deu a idia e Bell aproveitou o vacilo de meucci e ficou famoso, o mais importante alm de criar  registrar primeiro...|`|b0d299cc68977be3f727cd0d6b3ae0a3aa	Sem querer polemizar o assunto, quem realmente se interessar pode verificar o stio http://.rlandell.hpg.ig.com.br/portugues... que afinal de contas apresenta os vrios estudos, inventos e at patentes principalmente sobre telecomunica??es, do Padre Roberto Landell de Moura (1861 - 1928), brasileirssimo, vale a pena visitar este stio e conhecer a vida e os inventos (entre eles o TELEFONE sem fio) deste grande homem.

AA11541003	Yes. It is possible... and yes Nokia's, in general are the best brand-wise for reception. However, Motorola's are very good too. The thing to remember is that there are ALOT of things that can affect your service. Your phone or antenna could be damaged, your SIM card could be corrupted or out dated, you could be in a low coverage area, your signal could be blocked by inanimate objects, the towers in your area could be having problems, or your frequency may need to be changed by a technician. The only way to determine this is if you go to a Cingular corporate store and a representative will be happy to trouble shoot it for you. Hope that helps! Good luck :)|`|fbf013e27ee0afd8df76c492edf2b9e2aa	not to sure i have had lg all my life and i always have good service(verizon) but i heard that too that nokia is really good my mom has motorolla and she is using my phone half of the time!

AA11541003	Usually, an extended network means you are roaming on another companies towers. You would have to contact your service provider and ask for nationwide service to use the extended network, if she does not already have it. Most companies have free nationwide service these days. Roaming can be quite expensive, so tell your girlfriend to contact her service provider to find out exactly what is covered under her calling plan. Hope that helps! :)|`|67b145c3c7daae653c66eba277d35dd5aa	and extended network extends the range of the network so theres no roaming charge, and just got to like a verison store and ask about it and theyll hook u up
AA11541003	First of all, It depends upon what you did to "reactivate it".     More than likley, the phone that you purchased is locked to another service. For instance, it is a Cingular phone, but you tried to put your T-mobile SIM card in it. This won't work because it is locked to only work with Cingular service. You can get the phone unlocked at your local cell phone repair shop for around $30 and then it will work with any service.     Another reason why you might have got this message is if you just tried to keep the SIM card that was already in the phone and just buy minutes for it. You would still have to take the phone to your local provider and get it activated to the prepaid plan of your choice and get a new SIM card. A SIM card can only be used one time. If the person you bought it from once had a Prepaid account, they probably would have canceled it as it would have had their personal information attached to it.     Finally, it is also possible that your phone is just broken. I would recommend taking it up to your local provider, yours or which ever one is on the phone, and they can troubleshoot it for you and give you a difinitive answer on what the problem actually is.   Good luck!!! :) Hope that helps! :)|`|58a202cad33b52ff181ecd04921e26ceaa	depeends what brand ?  u didnt get ripped off if you just need a new sim card... each person to each phone gets a sim card... that just means you have good service when u get it contact me with more info on your phone.|`|a39fb61f84045cc53761c33289c5bebbaa	looks like u got ripped off buyer beware at garage sales!!

AA11541003	Not possible. Sprint's network (CDMA) dose not use SIM cards. You would have to have a GSM provider like Cingular or T-mobile to us a SIM card. Sorry!

Hope that helps!!! :)|`|39c2423cd4fe9fd25dd4090852d1ac04aa	Unfortunetly sprint phones don't use sim cards Sprint uses CDMA techonology and so does Verizon.  Tmobile and Cingular use GSM techonology.  For what your wanting to do you will have to contact sprint directly.|`|AA10563459	hmmm what ok there is no sim card as you have found out, so you want to change the service to one phone to another? if so just call customer service and ask for a ESN   change, that is the number behind your cell under the battery... they will talk you through and switch the service from one cell to the other...

Hope this helps|`|AA11541003	Cingular, hands down. Cingular has the largest voice and data network than any other provider. You are going to get more bars in more places! You can compare with the coverage map found here:    http://onlinestorez.cingular.com/cell-ph...    I'm sure you've seen the big news in Cingular's current add campaigns, that It was also determined by the leading independent research company that Cingular has the least dropped calls than anyone elese. I live in Austin, TX which is a big college town and I have alot of customers that travel. So, I have verified this first hand with hundreds of people.     Finally, Cingular's has awsome features like Rollover and free mobile to mobile on all voice plans. Cingular is not going to take your minutes away from you, they are yours to keep, the fairest deal in wireless. In addition, Cingular's got some great phones to choose from and a high speed 3G data network. In fact, our new HSDPA network will soon be able to do video calling! Theirs won't. It's a no-brainer... choose Cingular!!! :) :) :)|`|04788787fb8f91a820f369d68ca6a040aa	cingulair because they have minutes that roll over to the next month and their lowest plan is 39.99!|`|45e22fe7504a9fa7b231ee0b41cb66bfaa	I have tried many of the available carriers.

10c752c63c42eb9ce7f7f37537e9afe4aa	I like it on vibrate if you know what I mean.|`|AA11541003	What you are probably referring to is a hybrid pre-paid account like Cingular's Go-phone Pick your Plan. This is a no contract pre-paid account that you would pay for with a direct debit out of your checking accout or credit card. You are billed for set amount each month and the minutes are a flat rate per minute with better rates on higher plans. If you run out of money mid-month, you can just call from your phone and add more $$$. You can also get extra features like on contract plans with a hybrid account, like free nights & weekends, free mobile to mobile. Plus, you can even add extra packages for text messaging and internet or just use on pay per use. There are no bills sent to you, you do not have to purchase those pre-paid card thingys... it's really very convienent. There's more info about it here:     http://onlinestorez.cingular.com/cell-ph...    Hope that helps!!! :)
87c52a1f1e2a43d47ad46564229e0f0aaa	it gives them a little bit of an edge. Cingular has the largest number of subsribers as well as the largest coverage area and most reliable network.  Most people say the same thing about verizon as well, but the latest jd power and associates do rank cingulars network as the most relaiable, verizon will still say that theirs is because they use a different technology, so when they say the most reliable network they mean most reliable cdma network, they just dont have to say it.  Cingulars rollover minutes are nice because they can help avoid huge overages.  Your rollover minutes expire after 12 months.  But the way it works is that your rollover minutes are seperated month to month, so in your 13th month of your contract you will only lose the rollover mintues from the 1st month if they are still left, you will still have 2-13, so you always have a bank of twelve months of rollover, it is a sliding scale of 12 months, during the first year you lose no rollover minutes at all.  where as verizon offers you basically nothing for your contract cingular at least lets you not waste your unused minutes.|`|AA11541003	Totally!!! Rollover is great and it definitely gives Cingular a competitive edge. Nobody uses the exact same amount of minutes each month... there's always going to be those times around the holidays, or your traveling, or you've got sick family member and you end up using double your normal amount of minutes in some month. Then you get slapped with a huge bill.     With Rollover, you can avoid the overages and not suffer any undue stress in these situations because you know you've got the Rollover to cover it. I always recommend to my customers that you can start your first few months with a higher rate plan than you think you might need... accumulate some Rollover...  then if you decide to go down, you can take those extra minutes with you to your new plan! And you don't have to re-sign a contract or pay anything to change your plan. You can only take up to the amount of the plan that your going to, but suppose you could start your lower 900 minute plan off with 1800 minutes.    It's really the fairest deal in wireless, they are YOUR minutes that you paid for afterall... and with Cingular, they're yours to keep! And by the way, Cingular has Rollover on ALL of their plans as well as the largest nationwide coverage and... as mentioned before, the actuall most reliable network. :)|`|9a69121ee57bce916393b3d26387fe43aa	i have cingular. the coverage is awesome and they have a great range of nicely priced phones and accessories, especially when you sign a new contract.    the rollover minutes are nice if you have a very good idea of how many minutes you use in a month. i had a family plan with 1400 minutes for two phones and after a couple months we realized that we use more like 700/mo. the catch is that when you *downgrade* to a lower plan, you lose the minutes, so you can't stockpile minutes and use them later on a cheaper plan.    my best advice is to look at the numbers and people you call the most and take advantage of free mobile to mobile minutes- where calls to people in the same network are free. most everyone i call (cell phones only) are on the cingular network, so i can get away with using only a couple hundred actual minutes per month. cingular had the largest network, so there's a good chance that the people you will be calling are on that network.

Unfortunately, Sony Ericsson dose not make any CDMA phones right now except for the T608 which just came out:   http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.p...

Landline phones are definitely the most dangerous, since the wires that they are connected to can be hit by the lightning, then travel through the line to your telephone and zap you. One of my best friends was actually hit by lightning in that very way!!! He was on the phone with another one of my friends when it happened... luckily he was not badly hurt due to the fact that his multiple piercings helped to discharge the electricity!!! Crazy.... hu?!?!    Cell phones and cordless phones used indoors are perfectly safe because there is no wire through which the electrical discharge of the lightning could travel. When used outdoors, the threat is still low due to the fact that cell phones generally contain an insignificant am out of metal.      Hope that answers your question!!! :)|`|b74c5e942e816ed6f884493601aa6751aa	There were a bunch of warnings about using cell phones in a storm after one lady in Great Britain was struck while using one.  It should go down in history as the biggest case of safety-hysteria the world ever saw.  Using a cell phone or cordless phone do no more to attract lightning than holding a butter knife against the side of your head, and doesn't come close to the risk of holding a butter knife above your head in a storm -- which still isn't very risky.    A phone with a cord is dangerous, because lightning could strike anywhere along that telephone wire and find the most convenient path to the ground through your body.

AA11018224	Yes you can! Check the port compatibility.
AA11018224	Yes you can-the reason you have purchased it,but you can't export the file.Use the Window media player or Quick time software.
AA11541003	They are a mobile service provider, just like Cinguar, T-mobile, Sprint, ect. They sell cell phone service as well as mobile phones. They do not have either a good selection or good deals. Their phones are expensive and their service is terrible from what I've heared from many customers. Their big thing is having no-contract plans. However, they provide local service only so if you leave your service city, you out of luck. Not a good deal!!!|`|5da81692b7d9910c16dcf6b3399e8c40aa	CriKet is a cell phone service. they sell cell phones. and there coverage area sucks.
AA11541003	No. The Chocolate is a CDMA phone, therefore, no SIM card. A SIM card is used for network connection, not storage for songs, by the way... if that's what you were asking about.|`|bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	The 1st answer is not correct. The LG KG800 is indeed a GSM phone and uses a sim card.   GSM900/1800/1900 Mhz  http://www.lge.com/products/model/detail...  Cheers|`|6337c4c892e9bfad7e05168ff3a2e339aa	i think it has about 256 mb, not exactly sure but you can always expand it with an sd card. it uses a sim card if you get the right phone. i got my chocolate from http://www.doiop.com/chocolor and i activated it on tmobile which uses sim cards, that day.
AA11541003	If you are using a PC, go to your START menu > Select MY Computer > and you should see your phone listed as an external USB device. From there, you should be able to drag and drop your songs. Good Luck! Hope that helps!!!|`|bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	Did your phone come with Motorola Phone tools? If so, Did you load the Motorola software? If not, you have to load "Motorola Phone Tools" Once the software (which includes the phone driver) are loaded. Open up the Phone tools program, from ther you can transfer and remove files to and from your phone. If you dont have the Phone tools software, Here is a link to the software  http://cgi.ebay.com/Motorola-OEM-Phone-T...
AA11541003	No. SIM cards ARE for GSM phones. Verizon uses the CDMA network which dose not use SIM cards. Hope that helps!|`|651b20e25fd509f40315f26559e6557faa	no, because, verizion is cdma network and they do not use sim cards (i work in cingular, and worked in verizon for 3 years)|`|ce789588412dbe1e29188dcdad5e4f2caa	Most of the time, the phones will not accept cards from other carriers.|`|000138b1e871aa45b2d7f6363977826faa	sure it will just keep entering the numbers.
b1zD3Straa	Yo uso ese servicio desde hace como tres anhos y me gusta por dos razones:  1. No pogo tarifa mensual por uso de larga distancia (solo los minutos)  2. Puedo usar mi telefono celular para marcar a mexico llamando a un numero 800 y mi tarifa es igual que llamando de la casa.  DESVENTAJAS:  1. A veces la llamadas tienen eco, o no entran o tinen retraso.     Para la raza que vive en USA, vi en un folleto que me mandaron que  tendran sistema que permite que en Mexico marquen un numero local y recibas esa llamada en USA. Yo no lo necesito asi que me vale.|`|b77953bd79db05f1736eb61bb8ff928faa	nose pero no me convense el servicio yo mejor agrege larga distancia ami telefono|`|r5sPITHraa	que es eso|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Bueno yo lo usaba muchisimo, hasta q se empezaron a inventar llamadas que yo no habia hecho..ladrones!!!!!!!!!!|`|5333fe9dc27c5fa3af4bc133f15aec1eaa	creo que te refieres a una compania que se ofrece cervicio de llamadas de larga distancia pues que te puedo decir, creo que al final es igual que las otras companias,|`|9e1defd9cdd90cf5f5478755dfe9c6a4aa	Pues te saca de un apuro si no tienes las famosas tarjeta prepagadas, y es mejor marcar con 10 10 123 que hacerlo directo y mas si no cuentas con servicio de larga distancia.|`|e890f2c0641107a6a68611f81200c4caaa	prefiero usar tarjetas .
eb8c02e625463b14e29d9c8eba9556eeaa	A 2 MP image will produce a 6x4 print with 300 dpi resolution, which is the "Gold Standard" for excellent prints.  That's 1800 pixels by 1200 pixels.  If you KNOW that you will absolutely not want to crop your images, then shooting at a lower resolution would be quite satisfactory.  I would NOT shoot at a higher compression (lower quality) rate, though.  This can lead to some real disappointments.    If you want to save space, consider using a 3 MP image (approx 2000x1500 pixels).  The full frame will give an excellent 5x7 print and it will give you a little leeway for future cropping to 4x6.  This will about double the storage capacity to your card.  For instance, on a 256 MB card, you could hold about 95 "best quality" 5 MP images and about 240 "best quality" 3 MP images.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	down size to save space  unless if you want to crop the pictures|`|42c1a337017d6f43964a7e568c1b5478aa	more pixels is always better,    try it out to see if the other settings are any better to you  personally I use a 3 mp for picts, and think they look fine.
AA11541003	It would help to know what you are trying to install and where exactly you are getting it from... but, alot of phone java applications are specifically formatted to a certain model of phone. So, it's possible that it is just not able to work of your particular phone. Try it again, if it doesn't work, mabey try getting it somewhere elese. Hope that helps!!! :)
AA11541003	You can not activate all 3 cards at the same time, you must do do each one individually. However, it only takes a few seconds for each one... no big deal. No, you can not go to the bank and get your rebate, but just think of these cards as cash... they can be used ANYWHERE that takes Visa. If you really need the actual cash, just offer to purchase something or give the cards to someone who will give you the cash for them.  Hope that helps!!! :)

I have had a HP M417 for over five years and am still learning, but the Canon camera below really looks great.  I finally solved the battery problem after five years.  Check this out at the first source link.    It is a good idea to read the owners manual.  You can view owners manuals at this link, but will need to Login. http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera ...    In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.  http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h... ...     The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.    http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5... ...  http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po... ...       For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)     There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.     Check this (Almost DSLR) FUJIFILM S1000fd camera, FinePix 10.0-Megapixel.   Life time Warranty (Parts & Labor).   Pros: Very good image quality, Plenty of resolution.   Cons: No image stabilization, Slow.   Wide-angle shooting, a 12x optical zoom and picture stabilization mode combine in this camera for exceptional shooting performance, even at a distance. Plentiful scene modes, autofocus and automatic white balance controls make this camera a snap to operate. You may be able to find it on the Internet for a lower price.  http://bountii.com/search.php?item=S1000... ...  http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau... ...

There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best.  The second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.     What gives a camera its picture quality?    It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.     Lots of great camera tips in this link.  http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...    My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.      The source links show most of the cameras out there with prices and make digital cameras work better with help on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.|`|VSWl45cKaa	Usually you can get the manual for the particular model in which you are interested from the manufacturer's website. There you can read the manual at your leisure and decide if the camera is too complicated as not all cameras are created equally user-friendly. You don't even have to leave home. In that way you will make fewer (not 'little of') mistakes.

Select the drive which is related to the USB and then OK  IT will copy it!  TADA!!!|`|71637feea148963d76aaebc741d3b2aeaa	I also have a 4GB ipod nano and it just loads the pics by itself. When you go to the front where the image of your ipod appears in itunes, go where it says photos and there all of your pics in your computer will load to there. About the videos I don't know anything about I guess you can't. Hope this helps :)
ofpmRvHpaa	Some cable and sat box's have a setup menu that offers "Dynamic Range Compression".  Set this to maximum.    "Dynamic Range Compression" is fancy talk for: Keep the volume changes in a narrow range.    My advice: get a DVR/PVR.  Schedule everything you watch to record on the box.  The remote has buttons you can use to help with loud commercials.    (Better yet - note the commercials that are too loud, write the companies and say you will never-ever buy their product again because of the offensive volume.)|`|VSWl45cKaa	some high end TVs or Home Theater systems have automatic volume limiting to keep the volume of loud commercials from exceeding that of the TV program based on the viewer's volume setting.     If your equipment does not have those features, then there is little you can do except keep the remote control handy. Hit the "Mute" button to enjoy silence until you "un-Mute" when the program you are watching resumes.
PpuOab4Gaa	It causes color imbalance. An old tv would need a tool called a degausser. Modern tvs have them build in. It activates briefly each time the tv is turned on. If yours is modern, the color will return to normal over time.|`|f1b6b1b26d3210d42e24c9cb20a453f4aa	Magnets are bad for CRT televisions.  A CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) works by firing a stream of electrons from the back of the tv set to the front.  When the electrons strike the phosphor compounds on the inside of the front of the TV they emit light, this is how the image you see is created.  The CRT also uses magnets internally to modulate the path the electron stream takes in order to scan the entire area of the screen.  A powerful enough magnet next to the CRT can disrupt this process distorting the image.  LCD and plasmas are not affected.
