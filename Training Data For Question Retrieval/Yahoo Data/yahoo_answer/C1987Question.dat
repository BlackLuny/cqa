I am attracted to the 17-40 because of the wide angle range, but I don't particularly like that it stops at f/4. I like that the 24-70 goes to f/2.8, but I don't like that i'm missing the range below 24. I'd be replacing an 18-55 range. i would be using it as an all around lens as well - some indoors/landscape/portraits. I'll say price is not much of an issue. Let's just look at pros-cons.      Basically what I'm asking is if anyone has experience with one or both of these lenses and what you think of it. I looked up online reviews myself and found them both to be highly recommended, which didn't help my decision making process.

When i came back all of a sudden my mp3 zune was gone and so was his friend.      Its been a week looking in my room and i figured that my brother friend has stolen it because when he came back to visit my home he was very nervous being around me and his friends are around 13 or 15. Plus my brother told me that he steals out of people homes from their money and belongings.      He brought him to our home thinking he wouldnt do that again.

20090304150629AADOuK1	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Which digital camera should I get?	I have been making myself dizzy trying to find a compact digital camera to take on vacation to Jamaica in a few weeks.  I didn't want to go ask a salesperson for his or her advise because I'll be buying it online [cost is an issue] and it's not right to waste a salesperson's time like that!  So I thought I'd try the internet...      I want something that can fit in my pocket.  I think 6 or 7 megapixels would suffice, I would like to be able to enlarge and print some of the nicer images but I'll mostly just be dumping the images on facebook.  I really want a strong zoom- at least 4x and even 5x optical if possible.  It also has to have a macro capability.  I don't want a camera that takes too long to take a photo- some I've been looking at can take 30 seconds to power on, and then 3 or 4 seconds between photos, and sometimes that's too long ya know!  I'm hoping to find a camera that takes consistently rich, highly saturated daylight photos, and also a decent night-with-flash.  Movie mode would be nice, especially if I could zoom in and out while filming...although I've read that some with this capability, the sound of the lens moving dominates the soundtrack, and that defeats the purpose for me.  It needs to have decent battery life, I don't want to be running back to the room every 100 pictures!  And I'm hoping to spend less than $150...the less I spend on the camera the more I have for the trip!  So I'm looking at new, used and refurbished.  I don't want to cheap out and end up with poor quality photos. If anyone has suggestions I'd appreciate it!

Ok, I have a Samsung ln40a650 LCD tv, Onkyo HT-S6100 (true HDMI, not pass through), a Motorola HD DVR cable box, and a PS3 for Blue Ray.      I would connect the PS3 and cable box via HDMI to the Onkyo receiver and then connect the receiver to the TV via HDMI; however, I have a Harmony 550 remote and it is difficult to switch between TV and Blue Ray when they are both connected through the same HDMI from the receiver.      So, I will be connecting the cable box and PS3 directly to the tv through separate HDMIs.  To get the audio to my receiver I was thinking about using separate optical cables from the tv to both the cable box and PS3.      My question is, will the use of optical cables hinder the HDMI audio?  Is there an easier way to do this?      Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

My parents and I have inherited this camera (Polaroid 335 Automatic Land Camera) and I want to somehow get a estimated price (sort of an appraisal) on it.  I've tried looking on eBay, and the site has other models, but not the 335..  So it's hard to get a correct price of what I could go with.  I do have an 'OK' from my parents to try and sell it on eBay, but I want to try and get a correct amount on it.  I don't want to sell it for less than $30 because of the fact that it was my Grandparent's camera.      The camera comes in the case, with a flash attachment and 6 extra bulbs for the flash, which I plan on wrapping in something soft so they don't break.      So, could someone direct me to a company or person that will appraise or similar - the camera and give me an accurate price that I'm looking at?   (OTHER THAN EBAY - since I've already looked there)      Thanks!!

I made the last payment on it in 1/09. They told me that it had to be sent directly to the company to be fixed. I do not have the computer still. I have talked to the guy who is in charge of electronis about 3 times now. He told me on the last week of January that it should be 1 or 2 weeks but he also stated that it is out of his hands. He told me that Compaq had to send out for a part. had to send I asked him about a loaner a couple of weeks ago and he said that bc it is paid off, they usually don't give loaners. But, he said he would check into it. He did not call back.      I called the manager of the store this past Tuesday and he said he would talk to his GM about it and get back to me Wednesday morning. He hasn't called. I have not been calling them constantly bc I know they don't have it, and maybe it really is out of their hands. Am I being to nice about it? Do I have an argument, or do I just have to sit back and wait? I'm thinking that the laptop must be in pretty bad shape or something.

In Control Panel, Portable Media Devices, double-click your iPod.   3. In the Tools menu - Options, in the View Tab, check Show hidden files and folders.   4. Navigate to the Music folder. On my 2nd gen 'pod, the full path is   Portable Media DevicesUSER'S IPOD (F)iPod_ControlMusic   ********   5. Select all the music folders, and drag and drop them into a folder on your hard drive, or directly into iTunes.   ********   Okay^^ theres were it doesnt work, I select all of the files, then I draged them to my empty Itunes Library, heared my computer start making noise (Knowing its almost working) then it staops and the library is still blank....   Anyone know what the problem is?
