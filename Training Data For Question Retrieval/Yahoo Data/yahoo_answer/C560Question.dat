I was at track the other day and suddenly got these shooting pains up the arc of my foot and through my ankle. So I had to go to the school sports physician and he said that I walk wrong, like on the side of my foot or something. Something about an over pronator? I dont know.

20090307080605AAYRS8I	Health;Dental	Pain in two molars, is this a cavity or thinning enamel?	Okay, so I've been in and out of the dentist's office for the past year or so. Last year I had to get a root canal, which was my first major dental procedure, and following that I got a lot of cavities (I had to get 3 molars filled at once and then went in again a month later to get 4 more filled on the other side). The last time I went to the dentist was a week, maybe two weeks ago, because I thought I had a huge cavity in my tooth but I had just lost a bonding, so I fixed that. Now I am experiencing some pain in two molars, one on the top and the one right below it on the bottom, and I don't know what it is!       It doesn't really hurt to chew on, is not sensitive to hot or cold, but it hurts when I grind or clench the two teeth together and the bottom one hurts sometimes if I touch it with my tongue or finger. It's been bothering me for a while now and I told my dentist and he said that he saw nothing wrong with the teeth. The pain comes and goes, and I don't see any cavities, and I just went to the dentist like two months ago so I don't think he would have missed any if I had them.       Now on the top there is a very sore, tender spot on the gums. I can feel something like a cut in the very back by my wisdom tooth and I don't know if it is just a canker sore from brushing too hard back there or an abscess.       Help!!!!!!!!      And the two molars that hurt are NOT wisdom teeth. They are the ones right in front of the wisdom teeth (which still need to be removed).

20090307083532AAoi9ab	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What is this thing I may have?	Right, so this is a bit of a long story, but just bare with me.      About three weeks ago I was taken into hospital after coughing up quite large amounts of blood. After a broncoscopy, chest x-ray and scan, it was established that I had an abnormal-looking blood vessel in my right lung, along with a lot of excess blood. The obvious conclusion is that this blood vessel has been leaking blood. But they can't work out the cause and therefore the treatment until they scan again me again more closely - and they can't do that until the excess blood in my lung has been reabsorbed. While I wait for that to happen, I am on something called Tranexamic Acid to stop the bleeding.      The doctor told me they do have an idea what it already is. The most likely thing he said, is that I have a "birth mark" on my lung - an odd blood vessel that just keeps leaking. That is easy enough to sort out - they can insert two metal clips to cut the blood supply from that blood vessel and that's it.      But supposing that is not the reason he said there is this disorder some people have that is to do with your immune system attacking itself which fmakes your blood vessel swell u, causing odd bleeding. He said other places you may get trouble are your nose - and my nose has been bleeding quite a lot. I have a split lip too which won't heal. He said this disorder is quite rare. Can anyone tell me the name of it? It's "something" syndrome.

Just had bunion surgery (base wedge osteotomy) a few days ago and I am in a plaster cast. I accidentally put a small amount of weight on my foot while getting out of the shower. It was not a lot of weight but enough that it hurt. It doesn't seem to hurt to much more than it did, but it does seem a little more swollen. I've had it elevated almost 24/7 since Monday.  I am just curious if I could have messed anything up or moved anything around.

I feel fine (100%) I have a good diet filled with fruits and veggies I drink plenty of water to where I fill bloated. Oh and when people grab my arms it turns white to where you can see their finger prints. Though it is fun to poke myself and see the traces of fingerprints that are left behind aha.

I've already asked around about it, and they all asked if recently ate before experiencing the short, albeit quite painful, chest pang. They told me it could just be a cause of indigestion or whatnot. Unfortunately, I haven't eaten yet when the event happened, and it happened 4 times throughout the day.      It really was transient though. However, the pang was sharp enough for me to notice (and clutch my chest in the process).

When someone is depressed is it typical that they "create" a life for themselves online but don't want much to do with real people in their lives? My 16 yr old guy friend is depressed and isolated...he is homeschooled and has no friends other than online. I think it is because he feels he doesn't have much in common with kids his own age so he searches on myspace and other places for people to talk to with his interests. Is it normal for him to have this online life? He talks online with people who honestly don't give a crap about him or his illness and considers them friends. Please give me your insight on this. Thank you.

Technically I am overweight (I have a BMI of 27.2) but I've been trying to lose weight so I go to the gym five times a week for an hour. And I am obsessed with going to the gym, if I think about missing a day or going for less than an hour, I start to get really panicky. Last week I could only go to the gym three times and I felt really guilty afterwards. I still feel horrible thinking about it now.      And even though I don't eat a lot of junk food, I eat a lot of healthy things like fruit and vegetables, whenever I do eat some junk food I always worry it's going to make me even fatter and it makes me want to go to the gym longer. Like yesterday I ate some chocolate and I was worried it was going to make me put more weight on.

20090307050838AAA8n0d	Health;Mental Health	Do you believe that time heals depression?	Yeah, well, Im a part of S.A.D.D. (Students Against Destructive Decisions) at my school and a while back ago we had to go around to classes showing a slideshow about depression and suicide prevention. And I remember one of the slides saying to cope just wait it out and it will get better. I was thinking, like, if that's true, what about me? Because I have Dysthymia (Chronic Depression) and I've been this way for about 3 years now. Its not like major, where other people in public notice and I can act happy and laugh a lot and ive given up on the thought of suicide or self harm, and can still function and get stuff done, it's just like there's always this undertone of depression and pain in my mind that usually comes out when im alone. And it kinda interferes with my trust ability when it comes to friends (You know, like, why tell them anything real important, if they're probably going to be gone soon or b/c i know they don't care) So I usually end up keeping conversations simple or random and crazy with them. I was thinking about the slideshow and that it kinda bothered me, because what do you do when time doesn't heal?

20090307041206AAJEFr7	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Nausea post septoplasty/turbinate reduction surgery?	I had these procedures on Wednesday. My main issue post-surgery was dizziness and sickness, and I was later given 3 injections of God-knows-what to ease the sickness, and barely ate anything, worrying I would barf. I gradually slowly began eating and drinking more in the evening, and further on day 2. I left the hospital in the early afternoon of day 2 with painkillers and such. Day 3 I became nauseous again in the early afternoon, and later vomited again including the small amount I had to eat that morning. Much later I had a small amount of buttered bread and soup to eat and was fine. This morning on day 4 I had not yet had anything to eat, and took 2 of my painkillers, a couple of hours later I barfed again -- vomiting nothing, and only tasting the acidy painkillers. Could it be due to taking them on an empty stomach? I know I feel dizzy due to not eating much and the painkillers, but is the sickness normal and will it ease? I hate it.

I can feel the pain in my right thigh on the side (around the middle but on the side, like where my hand would be if I were standing in 'attention' position). It goes from there to just where the knee begins but here it is on the front side. It's like a burning pain and almost occurs everyday. Nothing helps when it is paining. I have tried standing, sitting, sleeping, everything but it doesnt help. It stops on its own and then starts again, on its own. I can't pin point the exact place where it's hurting but it is 'inside' the thigh. I have tried hammering my thigh too to get relief but it doesn't help much. Earlier I neglected it, thinking it happened because I was driving a lot but now I don't drive much and mostly sit on a chair during the day and it starts hurting. Any help would be appreciated. I can give any other information too if it will help.

It's not easily viewable, not even with a mirror, but the one time that I did contort myself and check it with a mirror, I saw that it was slightly darker than my regular skin color. Ok, ok, it's kind of near my booty crack. Anyway, I felt it earlier, and it almost felt as if a thick, soft hair grew out of it so I pulled it, but it was actually a very thin piece of skin, about a 1/2 inch long. There was no pain, but it kind of scared me since it bled like crazy, and also, it wasn't there yesterday. I've never heard of a mole developing anything like that. Any ideas on what's going on? And as much as I would love to have a doctor take a look at it, that's not an option for me at this time.

20090307062128AAbHxc5	Health;Mental Health	How do I trust them again?	Hi,   Iwish try and keep this short,      Basically my mental health department removed my key worker from me without warning and told me I could never see or speak to her every again after seeing her for almost a year. i was told that i seen my key worker as a friend and that there was no theraputic relationship. I was treated like a criminal and they dragged up things over the year like times when I gave the key worker a card or a thank you gift, or a time when i couldnt get a hold of my key worker and asked was there another way of contact like fax or email- they now made it out i was looking for personal details of my key worker which is just not true. Basically they picked up on little things i thought were significant and which i was never told where otherwise and they were using them against me...all acts which where in no way harmful either. I am a respectful person and would have followed any rules laid out but the problem was that none were and my key worker never told me i was doing anything wrong.      I have never been allowed to see this key worker since and they will not allow for her o attend any meeting to sort out what went wrong and now they are saying that i am a lier!! e.g I once took in some drawing I had done to show to my key worker , it was infact my mums idea, to show her what I could do. my key worker stated that she thought they were great and would love some to put in my file, so I photocopied some and gave them to her at a following meeting. i am now being accuseed of giving her drawing and when I explain what happend they said I was lying and they no one would ever ask for drawings for a file.. I feel so betrayed and hurt to be treated this way.      I have filed a formal complaint and the response I got was pathetic. and now they are basically saying they did nothing wrong and anything i say they talk me down.      anyway the problem is how the hell do I trust my new key worker as she is involved with all these people and i now know how awful they treat people! When i told the new key worker how i was afraid to trust them she said that maybe i shouldnt see anyone from teh department, even if that leaves me with no support.      I have tried looking for a female private counsellor in my area and there are none at all just men and i cant have a male counsellor.      i feel completely trapped and I dont know what to do:(

Everytime my mom gets a picture of me she will make some comment about how "i don't look healthy, i look like a skeleton." I watch what i eat, make sure i don't get to many calories, or to much fat. I also read the nutriton facts on food and make sure it's healthy with not alot of sugar. There have been days where i only get 5g of fat? usaully i get like 7-10 g. i don't eat snacks either, even though sometimes i'm horribly, hungry. I'm afraid of gaining weight. I don't know why either. All these models and advirtisments for staying thin. Last night for dinner i ate vegtable soup and green beans and ny mom made some comment about how i should eat more, AGAIN. So when she left to go to the store, i cooked alfredo pasta. except i didn't eat it. I crammed it all down the garbage disposer and left the packet and plate open so she thought i ate something else.

20090307062448AA2HwOK	Health;Other - Health	As to a man's working parts...?	Not trying to be gross or crude here at all, but...my b/f is 24, I am 32. He stays at my place every weekend, which is fine. We have been sexually active for almost a year now, but as soon as we get naked, he gets an erection, whether I am in the mood or not. We always shower together and he seems to have no control over his having an erection. Like most guys, he believes that his having an erection means I "want" it. Any suggestions for gently letting your man know "not tonight"? I am ready to tell him to go to the other bathroom and masturbate himself. My ex was able to control himself after a couple of weeks of dating, so I don't have any experience in this area. As I stressed before, I am not trying to be offensive here, but just get control of the situation.

20090307065421AATK4iB	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	In SO much pain with broken wrist, can anyone please help?	3 days ago i broke my wrist (distal radius). On the x-ray they noticed a couple of other bones were further apart than they're supposed to be which made them suspicious of ligament damage. I was booked an appointment with a orthopaedic surgeon yesterday and he decided to operate to have a look. Turned out the ligament was torn so he pinned the bones back in place and fixed the ligament (i apparently now have pins sticking out my wrist).      Anyway it is now AGONY. I was given percocet and tylenol 3 (paracetamol, caffeine and codeine). I finnished the percocet (wasn't given that many) and they only just took the edg of the pain and now im left with tylenol 3 which make no difference atall.      Is there anything else i can do?? Would ice help?       Im not keen on more percocet becauce they spaced me out a lot and i couldnt do much.       Thanks.

I know most women have some degree of cellulite, and I recently noticed that my inner thigh looks like what might be cellulite but I'm not too sure. I know cellulite isn't necessarily caused by being overweight but that it's inelastic connective cells behind which fat deposits. Here's what confuses me though: I'm almost 5'5 and I weigh about 100 lbs and I just don't see how I could get it since I have no body fat (I work out a lot as well). And I haven't gained weight at all. I'm pretty sure the last time I grew or gained any weight was probably when I was 15, and that's 3 years ago. So would this be cellulite or stretch marks or something? And what can I do to get rid of it, hopefully by April?

20090307090042AAZ2Ut4	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Left Abdominal Cramps?	For a while now, I've been having strange abdominal cramps on the left side of my abdomen. It feels like a light muscle tightening in the area. Every morning I force myself to get off bed because if I lie there too long, I feel the muscle tightening up a bit. It's this strange feeling that doesn't actually hurt but it's kinda discomforting to lie down longer.       I've been to my family doctor, he doesn't help much.  I've actually explained to him twice that I feel this strange cramp there. All he did was push it there and ask if it hurts. I say it doesn't because it's comes up infrequently. He dismisses it saying its nothing, I wanted to further examination such as ultrasound but he kept saying its nothing. So what am I suppose to do now...switch doctors? Anyone have any ideas of what it can be? I did my own research a bit, could it be IBS?

20090227135013AAWmvLY	Health;Mental Health	Is there a correlation with stomach / gas problems and panic disorder?	About 5 years ago I was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer. I removed myself from the stressful situation I was in and cut down on caffeine and it seemed to resolve itself. About 3 months ago I was diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Just today I noticed a connection between my panic attacks and my stomach feeling bloated, gassy, burpy and upset. Is this just my imagination, or could the stomach problems be a factor in my panic attacks? Any information on this would be helpful. I have not responded well to anti depressants or anti anxiety medication, it seems to upset my stomach and anxiety more. I have responded somewhat to traditional therapy with a psychologist. I was having a good run of a few days without ANY anxiety, or stomach distress, and today I noticed my stomach was making noises, and then later I had a panic attack.

I am 21 years old and i recently spent time in a psychiatric hospital where i was diagnosed as having a depressive illness. Upon my discharge i now see a doctor from the hospital who put me on a 2 year course of fluoxetine for the low mood which i have been taking for about a month now. However i really think that i may be suffering from Bipolar Disorder.As well as the depressed periods, there are times when i feel fine and bright. It changes from day to day, one day i can be okay and then the next feel very depressed and have thoughts of harming myself. I have lost quite a bit of weight and my sleep is affected too but my doctor says i just have to wait until the prozac works. Do you think i may be suffering from Bipolar or am i suffering from depression. Thanks

I wear tights every day and I sleep with normal underwear on, but with tight boxers on top of these, so I am wondering if this is what is causing my excessive discharge? It gets itchy at some point everyday and the area can be slightly burning, and the discharge is white - light yellow in colour, and very heavy so i have to wear a panty liner every day.   Could sleeping with no underwear on help this? and if so how long would it take to solve things?      p.s. is it ok to use intimate feminine wash?

I smoke weed pretty often, i'm not a stoner or anything but i know what it's like to be high and i can normally have an entire bowl to myself and be fine. Yesterday, though, i took one hit and started freaking out. Everyone was moving as if there was a strobe light and i got extremely nauseos. If you've seen the movie "A scanner darkly," i felt a bit like that but a little more intense. I came home and i puked like 6 times, and my mom said she wanted to take me to the hospital because my face was green and my lips were all white. I think that's weird though, becuase people smoke all the time to get rid of their nausea and stomach aches and stuff, but it had the opposite affect on me. Everyone else seemed to be fine, and we were smoking the same stuff. So i'm not sure what happened there...

I have degenerative disc disease. I've had the injections, discograms, this is my last resort. I am 49 and also have fibromyalgia and osteoporosis but my spine numbers are good enough for the surgery. I have been in pain for 13 years. This willl probably not be my last surgery as MRI shows thoracic and cervical disc problems. My quality of life has declined over the years because of movement problems and pain. What can I expect in regards to loss of movement? Any input would be very helpful. If the pain is not going to be alleviated then I will reconsider the surgery.

So my girlfriend and I have been going out for a long time, and we are already sexually active. We have done pretty much everything except for me fingering her, or us having sex. She wants to do this but there's an issue.      A while ago, she was sexually raped, and it has affected her a lot. She's extremely timid and scared of her vagina. However, we've talked extensively and SHE has decided that she wants to move on. However, because she is always scared of contact with her vagina, she always claims that it hurts when I try to finger her. This is understandable if she is tense, or not very wet.      But she wants to move on. This is my first serious relationship. I've never fingered a girl before, and I want to be sure I don't hurt her. I need advice on how to get her relaxed, and how i would approach this situation. It's also fairly difficult for me, because she doesn't shave her vagina and its very hard to see.       But we both are ready to move on. So how should i do this?

20090307090815AAmvh0m	Health;Mental Health	Do I seem depressed? What do you think?	I'm 14 and I think I might have depression. Although I did realized before that I suffer from on-and-off blues, my friends, my Mom and even my teacher think that there is something wrong with me.       Sometimes I just feel so sad, lonely and misunderstood. I'm always unhappy with my life and myself. I feel as if there is nothing special about me. And I'm not pretty, I'm not skinny and I'm feel like I'm no fun to be around. Worst of all, next year I have to go high school and I don't want to go because of these two boys that a year older than me always used to harass me last year (touching me, saying bad things to me) and it wasn't as big of an issue back then, but now I feel so scared because I feel as if there isn't anybody to help me or defend me at all if I ever encounter them again. And only a few of my friends know about it, and I always used to play it off like it was fine because I was embarassed to come out and say how I really felt about it.    And I'm also fed up with school because whenever I try to do good, I always end up doing bad. I'm just fed up.       I know that usually there must be a big event in somebody's life that causes them to be depressed, but really, for me it's just like the small things add up to make me feel so bad and sad about myself. Do you think I really have a problem or what?

I was at a Christian sermon today and the subject was "The holy spirit"   while listening I was feeling sleepy when I suddenly felt an odd sensation   it was almost like the feeling of coming up on ecstasy for the first time but not as intense   it wasn't a particularly pleasant feeling but it was definitely there and my heart rate went up, my palms became clammy and I wasn't sleepy anymore   I didn't tell anybody about it because I knew they would try to convince me that it was the Holy spirit communicating with me and I'd prefer an unbiased opinion   I'm just interested to know if there are any rational explanations for feelings like this?   I know at religious sermons some people will look for any sign to attribute to a religious experience and end up convincing themselves but for me this just came out of nowhere while I was falling asleep   is it possible that subconscious thoughts can cause strong feelings like this?      I haven't taken drugs for over 2 years now and the strongest drug I've ever taken is ecstasy, since then I've had no intention to take drugs again   I don't drink nor smoke and I'm not on any kind of medication   I have mild social anxiety although I've never actually seen a therapist about it, it doesn't have a huge effect on my life   I have concentration issues too and often feel agitated   I occasionally suffer from sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming   no history of insanity in the family   I'm generally happy with life even though I often feel stressed over little things      sorry if any of that was hard to understand, I'm just at a point where I'm questioning my sanity

20090307093501AAiCt5y	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Brain bouncing against your skull?	My father has had a cough lately, and he believes that every time he coughs, he can feel his brain hitting his skull.    I told him that if his brain was bouncing against his skull, he would be on the floor suffering and probably dying. I tried to explain to him how sensitive your brain is.   He then ridiculed and demeaned me, telling me that I was no doctor.   No, I am not a doctor, but the difference between my father and I is this:   I have been to see many "head" doctors for my own personal health, and he has not. MRIs, Neurologists, ENTs, whatever.   I think I have a decent understanding of how sensitive the brain is.   I wouldn't normally make a huge deal out of this sort of thing, but my father has been arguing about it since last night until now. He continues to tell me that I am just a moronic little girl and don't know sh!t. I don't want to start any arguments with him and I have no urge to "show him up". I'm rather used to this by now. Really, I just sort of wish he'd shut up.      This is ridiculous, but would the human brain not malfunction if it was being hit against the skull?

My best friend is really worried, she's described to me that between her labia and skin there is like a 2cm long tender bit (about 0.5cm wide). It's kind of like a sore, but it's more like a cut because there is no skin. She's tried Savlon and other anti-bacterial creams, which have reduced the redness around it but haven't helped to heal the skin up yet. She's a virgin and hasn't had oral sex either, but we're both really worried that it could be serious. She does get coldsores on her lips, but she said that it was unlikely she'd transfered it.. help?

Yes, I posted this question MANY times, but I am scared, if you understand and would like to help..please read on.         Ok so this happened on Thursday, I was working on my science project with my friend, and this kid in our class cut himself on something, he ran to me and wiped in on my shirt hood, then he wiped some on my friend's sweater arm. Now i always lightly hit her with the back of my hand to get her attention or something you know? And have scabs, and possible open wounds on my hands that touched that blood on her sweater from the guy.HIV! Next off, some were covered with band-aids but all moist under there, so with the blood on my sweater and washing my hands(not changing the wet band-aids after the wash, allowing hiv to pass..) also the blood might have gotten on my hands(probably did) and i ate lunch anyways with CUTS on my mouth, and in my mouth(lunch was an after hour this though!)      He said he goes out with a lot of girls and he does, makes out and what ever, he said he lost his virginity! What if he has HIV and passes it on!Hes good friends with all my friends, why am i scared!         I am gonna wait 3 months and get tested, but my mom wont take me she thinks i don't have HIV or couldn't have gotten, even if the blood was in my cuts he probably didn't have HIV   Also about 1 year ago , about 8 months i got gum stuck to my pants from a movie theater seat, eating afterwards without washing my hands, with wounds on my mouth(bulimia tends to do that to me..) SO what if i ahve gotten AIDS from that!?      So what if i do have HIV!?      Im only 13, i never kissed a boy, "went out" did drugs, why do I deserve this, im a good student im nice!! I think its unfair!         SO i eat unhealthy, but started eating better today, still junk but more fruits and stuff, more while grains, can i still ive long and happy with meds and diet and exersice!?

20090307090816AAGiPpU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	What type of foods should I eat? Doctor just told me that...?	My A1C was 5.7 after a test done December 20 because of frequent urination (not waking up at night & no other diabetes symptoms though). I had a follow-up done last week and my A1C came back as 6.1      He's attributing this to me either become insulin resistant (I think that's what it's called) or because I eat way too many carbs for my body to provide enough insulin for me. I'm in otherwise good shape, I'm 6'1", 180 lbs, 16 years old. My grandfather had diabetes though and he died of a heart attack when he was 50-something.       My blood glucose both times have come back at 83 which my doctor said is perfectly fine. My cholesterol is good at 125 and my good cholesterol is actually a bit above normal levels (if that matters).      I admit that I do eat a lot of bread. (2-6 slices a day, I eat chicken wraps (the wrap) and soft pretzels at school. I eat a lot of pineapple and grapes and plums. And my mom makes pasta (mac & cheese, spaghetti, ziti) all the time. Those all have carbs. I eat a lot because I feel that, since I look good on the outside and do athletics, I can't possibly be being that affected on the inside.      Apparently, I am though... So... I'm definitely changing my eating habits now. He says that because my blood glucose had never been above 100, there was no sugar found in my urine, and I show no other symptoms; he's pretty sure that I do not have Type 2 diabetes... yet. My doctor's recommended a no-to-low carb diet.       That's like chicken... salad/veggies... cheese, even... right?      I need some help. I'm trying to get through this before this problem escalates.       Thanks so much if you read this all and provide insight.

But it feels like my head is going to explode! I'll be cold all over my body, then I'll feel my forehead and it's burning hot. I even asked others if it felt hot to them, and they said yeah. Also, sometimes I get dizzy when I stand up. I don't even stand up so fast, either.I just get dizzy, or things will get slightly blurry. By the way, I DON'T have a fever. This is an everyday thing, and I don't feel sick what-so-ever. What do you think is wrong?
20090307091422AAKW9uL	Health;Alternative Medicine	"Happy Mood" chinese herbal supplement, worth trying?	I've stumbled upon a store in my city selling the usual herbal medicine, but something seems more genuine of this one than others. The herb is called "Happy Mood" and their website is  http://www.ancientacu.com  Ingredients are listed as...      Major ingredients:   Astragalus, Rehmnaniae, Angelica, Paeoniae Lactiflora, Bupleurm, Acorus Gramineus,Ophiopogon Japonicus.      Extracts of Schisandra, Paeonia, Acorus, Glycyrrhiza, Bupleurum, Ophiopogon, Citrus, Cornus, Angelica, Ziziphus, Albizia      They also offer a free sample, so it'd be of no cost to try. Do these specific herbs sound like something safe to take for a long period of time, if it were to work? Or would I be better off actually seeing a psychiatrist for antidepressants which we do know are not safe, or at least not pleasant, to take? (And please don't just recommend that based on the fact that herbs are often scams. Some herbs are known to work and be safe, I'm just not very up to date on what those are.)

I had gotten down to 2.5mg (using a pill cutter) about 4 weeks ago, and was feeling pretty good. Then, about a week a go, everytime I took my 2.5mg tab, I got a nasty panic attack; not just normal celexa withdrawals, but terrible, terrible anxiety attacks. I upped the dose and the panic attacks were even worse.       I realized today that the pills in question had been cut and sitting in my pill cutter tray for quite a long time. I think that they may have degraded over that time; they are generic and I think that the filler may have decipated. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of situation?

I started my period on March 5th-ish. Usually my periods are a dark red and somewhat heavy for the first 2 days especially. This time around it's a very, dark thick brown. There's no odor and nothing else seems to be too abnormal. I'm also on antibiotics for treating a bacteria infection on my cervix and whatnot (Didn't find out I had the infection until after I had sex, ugh) .. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it?      I was just wondering if this is normal.

He's 19, and I'm 16 and I used to be a virgin...or still am, I don't even know. Anyway, we do everything normally, and then when he tries to penetrate me it hurts SOO much that we just have to give up on trying. I mean, I know it is normal to hurt a little, but I know what I feel is too damn exagerated. Something musn't be right... I think my hymen is already broken, but still he can't penetrate me...and there was this one time, he fingered me, and he said he felt like "the end of my vagina". Wtf? Is my vagina that small??? I'm starting to feel really bad for my bf, cause he's being so sweet and patient with me and I really wish I could please him. (don't mind saying that there are other forms of sex, 'cause I know so - lol ) But oh well...I can't go to a gyno 'cause my parents are a lil bit conservative and I dunno what else to do... I''ve read something about vaginismus or whatever....could that be it? and what can I do?

Through talking I have discovered that I can barely remember anything that happened before my parents divorced, which happened around the age of 5 - 6. I can't even remember what I was even like as a child. My mum told me that before they split up that I was this happy-go-lucky kid with so much energy, but after my dad left I changed. The best way she could explain is that I was sad, like I had lost my best friend. I can't remember a thing; I can't even remember my first day of school, though when I was in year 1 I started a new school when we moved and I can remember that to the finest details. And pretty much everything since then.   I think being able to remember what happened around the divorce and remembering what I was like will be able to help me with my problems now, because I am an absolute wreck. Is there a way to do this??   (Sorry if this was really long and boring)

20090307101332AAx65TA	Health;Other - Health	Do you have to go to a GP to get a referral to a neurologist?	a few months ago I went to an orthopedics surgeon (i got a referral from a gp) for my tight leg muscles, but when he first walked into the room he asked if i had cp because my right hand was fisted and curled up in my lap. I said no b/c no one had said anything to me about that, but I've been thinking about it, and have realized that I've ALWAYS had my hand like that, and I hold it in close.       The OS diagnosed me with club foot, but I've looked at pics of me as a baby and my foot didn't really look like it was turned in. I know it's been weird for 13 years or so, but for the 10 years before that I don't know as I wasn't taking notice of it.       The OS sent me to PT to stretch out my foot, which helped tons. I talked with the PT on several occasions about how my right leg / side in general has 'high tone' which is an indicator of cp. I also cannot stand with my feet together. I'll rock back and forth and nearly fall over if I try. Always been like that too. Bit sad in phy ed when I was the only person who couldn't balance on one foot.       Also, this is the big one for me kinda wanting to go see the neurologist: when I was 13ish I had a MRI scan to check for a brain tumor as my vision got really bad in a 7ish year period. No tumor but the eye doc said that there WASN'T MUCH *MORE* BRAIN DAMAGE. Therefore my brain *IS* damaged.       I when I ask my parents they say they can't remember or they don't know. I have a feeling they DO know things but won't freaking tell me, so going to a neuro is my best bet...
20090307101700AAH0xbm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	My Skin on my face is Dry & Oily around my Forehead and nose....?	My skin on my face is a little dry and very oily on my fore head & Nose. It tends to get red a little around the corners of my nose. My nose has large pores that look like tiny black stuff is in them so blackheads and white heads mainly around the corners of nose but little acne. I dont have alot of acne just some acne spots like 4 or 5 on forehead where its a oily and dry spot. When i say dry on my fore head i mean lack of Hydration and on my nose occasionly i see skin peeling sorta its more of just flakes from dry, irritated skin. So, how can i get rid of dry (lack of hydartion), flaky/ irritated skin and acne on for head and those annoying/ embarrasing black heads on my nose?? Oh btw i have bangs and for acne treatment products i use Clearasil Daily Cleansing Pads & Neutrogena Wave but the neutrogena is a big contributor to drier skin and the flakes and irritation so i rarely use it twice a week maybe not even once for wat it does and the clerasil is a nighly to every other night thing just makes my nose a little red and maybe dry. So please give me some products/ hints/ tips. Lastly im a teenager guy

Everytime I think I don't understand something grammar related, I get obssessed and repeat it and have repetive quesitons as to why I it didn't make sense. Of course, not everything in life is going to make sense especially when you overthink it too much. My OCD is bascially the fear of not being able to read, therefore failing at school? Is it possible to become illiterate because of OCD?

The past few days, I've woken up just fine, then once I eat breakfast, I get a heavy wave of exhaustion. I've been sleeping at least 8-9 hours every night, so it's not lack of sleep. It only happens after I eat.      If I ignore the exhaustion, it'll eventually go away, until my next full meal, which is usually dinner. Then I get heavily exhausted again.      I'm 19 years old, 5'3, about 110 pounds and not on any medication. I haven't done anything differently with my hobbies, or eating habits and I eat fairly well and healthy, especially the last few months. Anyone have an idea?
