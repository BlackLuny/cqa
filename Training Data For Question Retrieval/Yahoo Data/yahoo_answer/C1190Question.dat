20090128183313AAic0hd	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to get rid of poofy hair!?	I just washed my hair about an hour ago, and I usually blow dry and straighten my hair after I wash it, but I really don't feel like doing all that tonight because Im sick and have lots of homework... Anyways..         I like the curliness of my hair right now, but as soon as it dries know that it is going to turn into a big poof ball! So tomorrow when I wake up, Im going to wash my hair and I usually put mousse, frizz serum and gel to my hair, but within a couple of hours my hair gets all poofy!!          So I guess my main question is....   How can I keep it from getting poofy?!?!      Thanks for your help in advance:)      -Brandi

20090128183516AArK1g9	Beauty & Style;Hair	What should I do? (bangs)?	Okay so randomly these little bangs started to grow, and its actually like a whole line of them. It looks like I cut them that way, and I didnt. Maybe my barber did? I dont know but every one is asking me about them because they look so stupid. Im trying to let them grow out but I really have the urge to just cut them off, but that will be bad cause then they just keep growing back. They are still to short to be clipped back, put in a head band, or bobby pinned. and NO, I dont want them burned off. I also tried spraying them with hairspay/ gelling them to the side underneath my other hair, but they dont stay for long. What do I do to hide them????      ______________________________________      Also, I really want side bangs, but im allways afraid to do stuff with my hair because im afraid it will look bad. Should I get them?      thnx.

20090128184817AAtJwdc	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is male pattern baldness normal to a young adult?	My question is - can Stress cause hair loss, such as male pattern baldness? I have been experiencing male pattern baldness in the front ("M" shaped) since i was 19 years ( i am 21 now), and i went to see my doctor also about it and she told me its normal and she told me to take rogaine, so I have been taking that medication for almost a year now. However, i have decided to stop the medication a few days ago due to the severe side effects (chest pain is one of them). I have been very stress lately since the death of my dad two years ago and i have been seeing a counselor for it. Is stress part of male pattern baldness? my dad had a thin hair but he never experienced male pattern baldness and im not sure about my mom's dad since he died when i wasn't even born yet (my mom cant remember either because she was only a little girl when her father passed away).      So what should i do? cutting all my hair is not an option right now since a lot of people tell me that I look very young for my age and my diets have been pretty bad due to stress. SO basically, i am underweight right now.      i need some SERIOUS advice. thank u for your time!

My best friend died in a car accident july of 07 and I went right away to get a memorial tattoo. I wasnt able to decide on what to get at the time, I knew I was still grieving and I needed to wait until that period was over with before deciding. I have gotten to the point where I realize I am ready to get that tattoo now, I have found peace in healing with her passing. Issue- I do not want her name and RIP or the dates. I want something more about life than death.  I havent been able to find any memorial type tattoos that signify more life than anything. Would anyone have any suggestions?

Some people (in other answers) have suggested shaving it again, but other people have recommended leaving it alone till it stops itching and and shave it after that, and eventually it wont itch when you shave.

[NOTE: I am a girl, despite my name.]      I'm 13 years old, by the way. I might think about becoming a fashion designer, and I only thought about this a few days ago. I was doing a 'career project' for school and it just popped into my head. I love to doodle many different types of clothes sometimes, and I thought this career would match me. The thing is, I really don't like sewing. I never really brought myself to like it. Before you say "well, practice makes perfect!" or "well, try to like it cause you'll need it!" or something along the lines of that...it doesn't really help me. I don't want to sew, actually. I just like designing the clothes. I can learn more about different fabrics, sure, but actually DOING the sewing? Eh, not my interest... I kind of sound bratty but still. Is it really necessary to actually 'know' how to sew? Because when I researched it, it mentioned sewing a lot.      So here's the tl;dr ... I want to be a fashion designer, but I don't like sewing. Is it necessary? Any tips on becoming one? [please don't tell me 'then it's not the job for you. if you really want to do this then you must bring yourself to like it'. It's probably most likely what people will say but...yeah. Be nice about it, please. Thanks for the help]

I just washed my hair about an hour ago, and I usually blow dry and straighten my hair after I wash it, but I really don't feel like doing all that tonight because Im sick and have lots of homework... Anyways..         I like the curliness of my hair right now, but as soon as it dries know that it is going to turn into a big poof ball! So tomorrow when I wake up, Im going to wash my hair and I usually put mousse, frizz serum and gel to my hair, but within a couple of hours my hair gets all poofy!!          So I guess my main question is....   How can I keep it from getting poofy?!?!      Thanks for your help in advance:)      -Brandi

I have been desperately searching for a new signature scent for myself after wearing one perfume for 3 years and I realized that I wanted a perfume that no one else had and that would be totally unique because I don't want to smell like everyone else. So I was thinking about layering perfumes, like I wouldn't actually mix the two perfumes together but I would spray them both on one after the other. Or I would use the body lotion of one perfume and spray the other one on afterward.      I wanted to see if anyone could suggest two perfumes that would smell nice together. I also really like Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture which I just bought, and I know a lot of people have this perfume so if anyone knows another perfume or scent that would work well with that, it'd be perfect.

Okay, I just got my cartilage pierced on the 17th of February (this year), and when I went to go clean it about 20 minutes ago there was blood on the back of the piercing and just a tiny clot of it, and then there was no more. I don't know if this is normal or not! It's been 8 days now and around the 23rd of February I woke up and found that same area with the cartilage piercing swollen and red. However, when I sleep, I do turn and roll around A LOT. Yesterday the swelling went down and ALMOST back to normal, and the redness went down, too. Today the swelling should be just about back to normal in a couple days, (or it looks like it), and the redness had also gone down a lot, too, but it's still a shade of red and there is still just a little bit of swelling. Anyways, is the bleeding normal because I slept on it and it's just now letting it all out? Because it's irritated? or is it infected? I don't know what to do!! Please help!! Also there is little tiny yellow-ish looking stuff that comes out from the piercing but it's barely anything. and it only comes out when I clean the piercing. PLEASE HELP!!

I'm thinking of buying Mood Pearl Color changing lipstick and I want to know if anyone has ever tried anything like this and if it really works.   The colors are supposed to change with mood. Hence the name. ha ha.   This will be a gift for my daughters 12 b-day. I thought they would be fun for her and her friends.   I found the ad in the Beauty Boutique magazine (u can find it online also) and it doesn't say who makes it.    If u haven't use the lipstick maybe u tried other products sold through this magazine? How was the quality? Was it worth the price?   There are other products I would like to try but I don't want to waste money if I can help it. Lol. Who does?   Anyway, thank you to anyone who can help.

My mom seems to think it is because I changed shampoos, but that doesn't make any sense (I used to use the cheap Costco brand shampoo/conditioner, and I switched and have been using Herbal Essence Long Term Relationship for about two months). It just seems so sudden that my hair has changed from being really curly to wavy (barely). What could have happened?

I can't STAND the nose I have right now...I obsess over it every single day...and this has been going on for years. I just can't seem to accept it for how it is. No one else has every told me it was big or ugly though. To me, it just seems way too big for my face...it gets super ugly and large whenever I smile. It's almost narrower at the top and it gradually gets wider and wider. I hate it!! I sometimes put a bobby pin on my nose to see what it will look like if it were narrower...and it makes me look 50 times prettier...I kid you not. I wish I weren't so focused on my nose...because if you met me, I'm not the kind of person that comes across as caring about those kinds of things. I've been hiding this inside for too long and now I'm seriously considering getting a nose job. I probably wouldn't be able to get it now though because I'm overweight...so I know the doctors wouldn't want to operate on me until I got healthier. What are your thoughts on people that get Rhinoplastys though...is it normal for me to be feeling this way? Or should I just focus on getting losing weight and getting healthy. For some reason, I feel like it's a reason I've never had a boyfriend...and I'm 18. It's been making really depressed lately and I need your advice. Please be kind.

20090128202229AAOKqDw	Beauty & Style;Makeup	OMG! My mascara made my eyelashes fall off and now I'm to afaid to use mascara ever agian!! Please help!!?	I bought this new mascara, it is by loreal called volume shocking mascara.  It is one of those that you put the white coating on first and then the black one.  I usually put on two of the white and then two-three of the black.  Well, at first little small clumps of black stuff stared falling of here and there, but I just figured they were clumps of mascara.  Then, the other day after taking a shower I noticed that my eyelashes appeared to be shorter and thinner, but I wasn't sure if it was just because I am so used to seeing myself with thick, long lashes because of the mascara, or they were actually following out.  Today I actually used a make creme remover and saw all these small black clumps everywhere, which I now assume are the top parts of my eyelashes.  My mom said that they did look shorter.  Do you think that the top part of my eyelashes fell off?  Is it safe to switch to a different mascara?  Will they take long to grow back?  How long?  Should I take a break from using mascara, and if so, how can I still get my eyes to stand out without the mascara.  Please know that I often get dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep, and using eyeliner only makes me look like a raccoon.  I appreciate any help or advice you can give me.
