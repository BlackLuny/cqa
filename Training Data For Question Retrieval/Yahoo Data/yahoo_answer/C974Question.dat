20090205153555AAsdZ0f	Sports;Basketball	Why do people think Lebron MSG performance yesterday was ebtter then Kobe's?	Do they just hate kobe or they dont watch basketball?      Lebron played 8 minutes more, and almost loss to the knicks, also when he was at 8 rebounds, he told his team to back off and let him grab the other 2. ANother thing is he took 2 more shots then kobe and still end up wiht only 52.      Kobe only played 36 minuntes,  19-31, most of them shooting.      Can you imagine giving kobe 8 more minutes?

But ever since he came there, they can't run the high tempo offense they used to because he is slow. They are 6 points per game down from last season as a team. Steve Nash's numbers are down this year because he doesn't work well with the new offense. Now the Suns are 26-21 and aren't considered an elite team by many.      Do you think the Suns would do better without Shaq? Or do you think the Suns were getting worse anyway and that it wasn't Shaq's fault?

20081001171614AAUZLjQ	Sports;Running	Running in P.E.? pLeAsE HeLp!!!!?	Today in gym class at school we are running. Today we had to run a little less than a mile around the track out our school. Our coach said that he expected us to finish in about 8 minutes and 30 seconds. I finished in 9 minutes and 15 seconds. And i was REALLY tired when I finished. I am a bit out of shape but I'm not fat so i didn't entirely understand why i was so tired. I had woken up early this morning and had a lot going on up until P.E. so I figured that was why. Now, I know that I am not a great runner but I thought that I could've done better than I did so at home, I ran for 9 minutes and 15 seconds and I wasn't nearly as tired as I had been in gym class. But since I don't have a running track at my house, I just ran in place. Was the reason I was less tired at home because I was running in place? Or is running in place just as hard as actually running? I need to know because tomorow in gym we are doing the same thing and I want to do better. So I want to kno if I should try and beat my time at school even though I was already tired then? Or should I try and beat my time at home even though I was running in place? Thank You!!

20081024192822AAu8njh	Sports;Basketball	Is this a viable NBA trade? (crittendon, reggie evans, jj redick, and brian cook moved)?	 http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...       Orlando gets the low post PF that they've been looking for to replace Rashard for a more traditional offense. They trade away two seldomly used players for two people that can really add to their depth.      Philly gets a 3-pt shooter for a PF made obsolete with the arrival of Elton Brand. They need one.  Their best is Iggy who shoots less than .400      Memphis gets rid of crittendon, from their glut of 1 & 2 guards and gets a PF who can modestly contribute.  Crittendon, a good young player, would never have been used in memphis, and Brian Cook will (if he stays healthy).

20090205123308AAxMNkS	Sports;Football (American)	How to get noticed by college scouts?	well this is kind of hard to explain but i have high passions for football and baseball. I'm a sophomore in high school and have played these sports all my life. This year i played quarter back for football and pitcher fr baseball. i have a good throwing arm and I'm quick with my feet. i led in passing and rushing for my team this year as a quarterback. i tore my MCL this year but came back after missing one game. i have just one problem i'm 6'3 and skinny and i find myself thinking that im not big enough. i eat like a horse ,but just don't gain any weight. My dad and my coaches say i'm real good a football but if i wanna get noticed by scouts i have to get bigger. I lift just as much as my other team mates but colleges aren't looking for the average there looking for the best. My 40 time is 4.9-5.0 and i love to scramble.    Its just i'm worried about college and getting noticed. HELP!!!
20090203022804AAzMImF	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	As a proud Liverpool fan ( And Irishman )?	It saddens me that relationships between Liverpool and Arsenal fans seem somewhat strained at the moment  !   What's it all about ?   The two clubs have always had a healthy respect for each other and the Irish link between the two clubs was always strong with so many players on both sides being International team mates .   I know the Irish link is pretty much broken at this stage but where has it all gone wrong with the fans ?   Please don't bring up Michael Thomas in ' 89 ' coz most people on here are far to young to remember it .

He is confident in the pocket and knows where his WRs are at.  His O Line has respect for him in clutch situations.      So why do so many think a QB is the answer to the 49er problems?  I think we need to concentrate on getting a solid O line and a strong pass rusher first.  A DB wouldn't hurt either.

20090203040158AAeY08N	Sports;Baseball	Now Mets is sealing the deal with Perez, best rotation in NL? ?	I repeatedly saying Perez is second best no.4 pitcher in NL (Second to Ted Lily) and now Mets has a rotation consists 4 pitchers will at least above average pitches in their arsenal. Their pen and line-up can support whoever is at no.5 spot and I am sure the 5th pitcher won’t contribute 19 loses.        Let’s compare Mets and Cubs rotation:   Santana > Zambrano   Pelfre   Rich Harden (because Harden is more injury prone)   Perez < Ted Lily (17 games winner at no.4, that is just crazy)   Whoever<whoever (Lets face it, no matter who Mets put out there, he sucks)      Well, it is about even but it is always the ace that matters. Santana is on course to win 20 games as always especially with bullpen upgrades this offseason. Carlos is also possible 20 games winner but he never did it. I say Santana has at least 2 games advantage over him.       Mets has the best NL rotation? Any answer is welcomed and feel free to compare rotations with Phillies, Braves, D-backs or Giants.

He is 6'4" 205 and runs a 4.5 forty. his name is KENNY BRITT and he will be a star. idk what they should do in the first round but BRITT should be their 2nd rounder. and when i said they need a 3rd down RB i ment a guy that is like Darren Sproles and Maurice Jones-Drew was 2yrs ago

20090205154837AAl9nEz	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Asking advice on 10-team 8-keeper baseball roster - trade, or just keep my top 8?	I'm in a long-running, 10-team fantasy baseball league where we keep 8 players each season.  Our final keepers aren't required until a week before our mid to late March draft, but we can trade keepers and/or draft picks, with the only requirement being that any players obtained via trade must be kept, unless they are sent off in a separate trade.  Between trades and drafting, I rebuilt my core of keepers, and now have a bit of a dilemma for maximizing my potential for 2009.  Based on there being 10 teams, and 8 keepers each, the top 80 ranked players essentially are keeper-caliber.  Here are my best 9 players that all rank in the top 80, along with the pick each was taken with, according to a fantasy expert online draft:      A-Rod (2)   Miguel Cabrera (7)   Josh Hamilton (12)   Mark Teixeira (13)   Matt Kemp (25)   CC Sabathia (36)   Brian McCann (41)   Jake Peavy (51)   Francisco Liriano (80)      I've been considering offering the following trade to one team in my league: A-Rod, Teixeira, and Kemp for Albert Pujols and Jose Reyes.      The idea I have here is to still have 8 keepers that rank in the top 80, as I have a hunch to give Liriano a chance in his first full year back from Tommy John surgery, and make this 3 for 2 trade to upgrade the best of my keepers.  Obviously, the other team would still have to accept this deal, but the big question is, is this worth it?  Making the deal would trade the players drafted 2nd, 13th, and 25th, for the 3rd and 4th players taken (Reyes went 3rd, Pujols 4th in that draft).      Fire away with your thoughts/advice...I'm curious how many other folks think Liriano is worth taking a shot on keeping, or if this would be a bad idea dealing Kemp.  Thanks!

20090205163541AAwV1xP	Sports;Football (American)	Do you agree the Pittsburgh Steelers are the best football team in HISTORY?	While it may be technically true that the Packers have won more "championships" than the Steelers, you have to remember that all but three of those championships came BEFORE the Super Bowl existed so they shouldn't count at all.      The Packers won 3 championships in the 60s before they won first two Superbowls for a total of five NFL championships BUT the NFL teams in the early 60s were HORRIBLE.      An average college team could DESTROY the Packer teams from 1961 or 1965.      It wasn't until the first Super Bowl that the NFL didn't suck.      Do you agree?      The team with the most recent success is the best team ever because the NFL has increased in talent.      Pretty much all NFL Championships BEFORE the Super Bowl are a joke.

I've never really done anything that required so much of me ya know?      I went to conditioning 3 times a week for like a month and a half (sometimes 4 times) and I've stopped eating cheeseburgers everyday. I'm even drinking more water; like 40 fl. oz a day.      But I'm not up to par at all. My fastest 200m sprint was 36 seconds; the rest were 37 & 38 seconds. We did hill runs before that (6) and ab and upper body exercises and it's late in the week so maybe I'm just tired. I just know that I got creamed out there today.      Except for the hill runs I did ok on those.      So yeah, other than going to practice what else can I do? Do you know of any lunches that are healthy that I can take to school other than ham & cheese? I also have a sweet tooth so do you know of any sweets that aren't too bad for you other than fruit.       I'm trying to eat healthier but I've never eaten healthy so it's hard to go cold turkey.

I'm looking for a good fighting game (coming from the old sega mortal kombat games back in the day.. but want something as realistic as possible)   i rarely play my 360 and if i had a fun fighting game i might play it once in a while      i played soul caliber a couple days back, and button mashing worked for me as good as the person who owned the game and was very experienced at it..      i've been looking at DBZ burst limit   but i never really looked into those other 120312 games (i know theres tekken, virtua fighter and 20 million others..?)      what games do you like the most out of multi player fighting/martial art games and why?

I currently have an Rm7, just got it a month ago, and don't like it too much.   -Whenever I take a slapshot it either goes high and wide or straight and about two feet off the ice, there is no in between. its weird.   >curve: spezza pp19    >lie 5.5   >flex 70    http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=20...     http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=20...        also have an Rm9. THE BEST stick I have ever had. altough ive have it for two years or so, and its getting kind of beat up.   -theres a small crack in the blade. and ive notices too theres a crack starting to develop along the bottom of the middle of the blade. and because of this i want to get another one, just becuase i like this one so much.   >curve: SA Crosby   >flex 95   >no lie indicated    http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=20...     http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=20...       i have a couple questions:   1. What does the 'pp19' mean on the RM7 (first stick)?   2. What does the 'sa' mean on the RM9 (second stick)?   3. Are the Crosby curves on different makes of sticks the same?   4. What curve in the Sherwood line of sticks are similar to the crosby?      thanks

20090205163644AAhKLVh	Sports;Winter Sports;Snowboarding	Will my 32 boots fit in my Burton bindings?	I bought a new board today, with Burton Stiletto bindings, and I am planning on buying Thirty Two lashed boots. The bindings are women's size medium (6-8), and the boots will be size 8, so they should fit, but I was hoping that some one could confirm it.
