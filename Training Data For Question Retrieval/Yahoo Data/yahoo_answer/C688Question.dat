20090309175509AAS6r1V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IM PREGNANT, WHY DOES MY BABYS FATHER DO THIS?	why does he stress me out? he acts like he doesnt want anything wrong with me or the baby, yet when we get into a fight he ll ignore me for a day or two. he got mad bc i didnt want to keep the baby bc he makes me feel like crap, and my parents and hes in the marines and wont be around.      he says if i abort the baby he ll find me and kill me(just talk) but still i feel bad, if he doesnt want me to get an abortion shouldnt he be more supportive? il txt him i love the baby and he ll txt me no you dont, and you dont care. he starts fights with me and makes me feel really upset. i txted him im sry il keep the baby its just hard bc im in college and youre never going to be around. i was being nice and he didnt txt me. im not asking for a call, just a simple txt that i know he can spare.       should i get the abortion and leave this loser behind for good? or what should i txt him? im afraid if i flip out he ll call me crazy, but idk what else to do? i refuse to let his mean attitude stress me out or ruin my mind for school.
20090309175522AAslW9s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to start talking to him ..but I'm scared that he doesn't wanna talk to me anymore?	So I've talked about this certain guy a few times on here but anyways, we were really close to going out. We flirted, hugged, played around with eachother during class, & texted sometimes after school. But I always played hard-to-get with him & I think he felt as if I wasn't interested in him so he got another gf & ever since then, we don't flirt or text anymore, we basically don't talk but he has randomly hugged me a few times. I've asked on here if he wanted to still be friends with me & most people told me he probably still might have a thing for me. I think he might be just a bit scared to talk to me first (he was when we first started talking), I wanna talk to him again, because if we can't go out (he has another gf again) then I wanna be friends at least, I really enjoyed talking to him, he was fun. But I'm scared maybe he doesn't wanna talk to me anymore because he doesn't text me, doesn't say hi but sometimes he'll trip me or give me a hug. So how should I do it, should I just randomly go up & talk to him or take a more steady approach & just smile at him from time-to-time & say hi every once in a while until we start talking??       I don't know how to do it because he's always around his friends, I barely see him in the halls anymore, we don't have any classes together...what should I do?
20090309175616AADAq6i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me???????????	ok i was going out wit this guy that i really liked but soon we stoped talking 2 each other so i broke up wit him. so then he started talking to  me again like a mounth later and hes always staring at me a flirting with me, so then i was out of school 4 a week and my friend asked him where i waz cauze hes my neighober and then whan i waz back in school my friend told me that whan she asked him he waz like very concernd so then i had my friend ask him out 4 me and he said no but again every time he walks by me he says hi and stufflike that and he always blushes so my question is DOES HE LIKE ME OR NOT!! thanks
20090309175843AAVhOeK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think he is avoiding me?	I like this guy that I go to school with. When I first saw him, I thought he was cute but I was too shy to talk to him. I don't have any classes with him so it was even harder to go to him and strike a conversation because I didn’t were to start      In addition, we take the same bus after school. I wanted to talk to him for a while but I was scared.      So last week when we were waiting for a bus, he looked at me twice and it seems like he wanted to say something. Then I was just like” isn’t it cold, today?' then we started talking.      He sat beside me in the bus and I asked his name and he returned the question. We have been talking since ever that day. We talk about everything .School, life, hobbies, work ect. When he tells me about his daily schedule, he never mentions anything about him dating someone else or if he has a girlfriend . We never run out of things to say when we talk.      I catch the same bus with him at certain time so i now always make sure i am on the bus stop around that time so i won't miss him.Anyways,today he didn't come on to the bus stop.I knew that he came to school because i saw him in his class when i was passing.I was disappointed and i feel rejected.      so do you think he got the vibe that i like him and he is now he is avoiding me

20090309180059AAKzxKL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Asexual or something else?	Yes I am attracted to the opposite sex but I've never umm how should I put this, I never imagine myself in a sexual or romantic relationship with anyone.      I think maybe because I see negatives outweigh the positives for  being in a relationship.  I just don't see myself ever in one.  I don't think about marriage or a living with a partner, so what does that make me?      I don't want to call myself selfish because all I am thinking about is myself and how to live my life. I do want to have babies and become a mom.  Maybe I am heterosexual but not in pursue of a relationship?      Anyone like that out there who is just like me?      Thanks.

20090309180224AARub1n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do men want sex so much and if they don't get it they become complete butts?	I am a woman who works 6 days a week at a labor job where I have to be able to lift at LEAST 70lbs. I have 2 kids ages 4 and 5.  They both go to school but the 4yr old goes 3 days a week for 3hrs.  My daily routine consist of going to work at 12am getting off at 7 sometimes later coming home getting them ready for school (dressed, breakfast, etc) then making sure to be up by 12:30 to get one off the bus the other comes home at 3:30. Then staying up til my husband comes home so I can go to sleep. He doesn't understand what I go through he is more concerned about getting sex whenever he can and if I don't give it to him he turns into a butt.He whines about helping, even though I clean and wash clothes on my 1 day off when he has to do it he talks like why should he have to do it. He says I am cheating, uses money as leverage when usually he says it's ours, he'll do things so I can't get sleep or he will wake me up out of my sleep repeatedly. and on the weekend I have to go to work at 10pm. It is to the point I run out of the house when he gets home to avoid the drama. Who is right in this situation?

I am no longer on speaking terms with the guy and there are several problems there.   the thing is i want to try to forget about him but he's always on my mind.... what do i do?   i really want my marriage to work out for the sake of our kids and i know the hubby loves me but i feel like i am being unfair to him by not being able to love him the same way.  i have issues i know but not sure what to do.

20090309183439AAOmE88	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	New to the whole swinger thing and need some advice?	I'm 27 and have been married since I was 19. Lately, my husband and I and our other close friends, another married couple, decided to give swinging a try. We discussed it for a long time before we actually tried it. Everyone was legitimately cool with the idea. The only thing was the guys weren't comfortable doing anything together so we had 2 threesomes instead: me and her with my husband, and me and her with her husband. No one got jealous, we all felt good about it, etc. The only thing is, I found myself really liking getting that sort of attention from her husband. I don't want to have an affair with him or anything, but I'm worried that if I do it again those feelings will become stronger. Should I just say I don't want to do it anymore? If so, what reason should I give that won't make my friend mad? Or is this a normal feeling that will fade?      Just to clarify, no one had intercourse, we just fooled around a bit. People who want to b**** at me for my husband and my own personal decisions and preferences need not respond.

20090309182344AAr5WX7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy friend acting strange!?	There's this guy who I'm really good friends with. We hang out a lot and many people think that we like each other. But we're friends. He asked me that once and I said yes we are friends. Anyway, he used to like this girl who I work with and share a house with. She doesn't like him but likes to flirt with him (he knows this). Anyway, the guys we hang out with have been teasing him about her just recently (which is fine with me).   BUT, he asked me if I liked someone and I said yes and basically, without telling him in so many words, he now knows that I like his best friend, who doesn't like me (as far as I know). Anyway, since I told my friend (the one I'm talking about), he's started acting differently. He's been a little distant. We used to talk a lot but now, he's busy a lot. And this evening when we were coming back from somewhere (the girl was there as well), he drove me and she went with another guy and i said sorry that it hadn't been her and he said who cares, don't be. And we just talked and usually we joke and things, but he was pretty serious and he just seemed sad. I asked him if it was cuz he didn't get to speak to her and he said no, that wasn't bothering him cuz he didn't care about that anymore. And when we were at the pub later, he bought me a drink and though he sat next to the other girl, he spent the whole time smiling at me (not in a cheesy way), just seemed sad.   I don't get it, why is he suddenly like this?!!

20090309181611AA8eKWA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get closer to a girl?	I think this requires a little background info. Basically, we're both juniors in high school and good friends. But that's the catch - we're friends. I've asked her out (she said yes), and she says that she thinks she likes me and likes being with me. This was all 3 weeks ago.      But we're friends - we go out for lunch sometimes, and we don't do any "physical" things to each other (you know what I mean). How do I take it a step further? I really like her, but idk what it is - is she just not ready for a relationship?      It's fine if you guys give just a general answer about relationships. I know that it's impossible to give good help without really knowing us.      What do I ask her now? I can't say "will you go out with me" again, cuz that would just be stupid.

20090309182107AAHlReW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over hating my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend?	I'm not sure how to deal with this, as I've never had such a jealousy problem before. Please read all of this, as it's really complicated...      My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 months and I'm absolutely crazy about him. Before we started dating, we weren't even friends, we just hit it off right away and we still get along great- we rarely fight, and both of us have found in each other what we've been looking for, for a long time. What we have is really strong, far beyond the "omg i luv him so much" relationships alot of people think count as true love. But...      I thought he was single when we got together- it started as a simple hookup. But, he lied to me about a girl he had been dating for a long time-  I thought they had ended long ago, but they were still kind of together. Well, he went back and forth between us for a few days, until asking me out, and I talked to her, and got the true story. It was a huge mess, and I got hurt pretty badly. But I forgave him. And then a month or so later, she begged him to just meet up and talk, and they kissed and he almost cheated on me. (Yes, I talked to her and got her side too).    A little while later, he accidentally called me her name (not during sex or anything, during a little play-fight about me guarding a secret and him begging to hear it, and he accidentally called me her name... that one hurt). He froze up after he said it and got really upset and ended up in tears. I've forgiven him for all of it, I truly have. I know some people will suggest that I'm not over it, but I forgive him with all my heart, and don't hold anything against him. What's going on is just me now. I don't even talk to her, and he doesn't either.      I know he's much happier with me, and that she has nothing on me anymore, despite the fact that I think she's much prettier and smarter. My problem is, I can NOT stop comparing myself with her! It's been four months and she haunts me all the time, I even had to block her on Facebook to remove all traces of her and try to help myself. It's not even a war between us anymore, now it's just me, but it feels like she's constantly watching me, judging me and thinking of how inferior I am. She's asked both of us before what I could possibly have that she doesn't. I'm pretty self-conscious to begin with. He knows I still think about her and compare myself to her, but I don't want to tell him how much of a nightmare it is because I'm afraid it will tear us apart, and I'm not afraid she'll get him back- we're together to stay for a WHILE. I care about him so much and he wants to help me about this but he doesn't know how. I can't tell him how bad it is... What can I do? Will I ever get over this?      I'm really sorry this is so long... I can't find this question anywhere else because it's so complicated. Thanks for helping :/

20090309181816AA6LEAr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	WHEN ARE MEN GOING TO LEARN?	Yes, there is a huge difference between love and lust, and it takes way more than just good sex to make a relationship/marriage work.  However, good sex is key to be happy with someone for the rest of our lives and to that regard: why is it so difficult for men to understand that GOOD SEX COMES FROM GOOD LOVING SKILLS AND NOT FROM GOOD LOOKS?      That a hard rock body is not all there is to be and pursue in bed? That you can look as good as you want but if you or your partner are as ignorant as cavemen with regards to making love or as selfish/self-centered as one of many Hollywood stars looking good will not be enough to have a mutually satisfactory sex life?! One need skills to be a good lover and those skills are to be LEARNED AND DEVELOPED!      I am not going to deny the multiple benefits of being and staying fit, but there is way more to sex than just the body and, with rare exceptions, men wrongly assume looking good/having much equals good sex tsk tsk tsk. When are they going to get over themselves to seek the knowledge they lack?      Many suggest "communication" but honestly, how do you think a man's ego would take a suggestion on one field most believe themselves to know it all even when they do not?

I'm just looking for people who have had similar situations as this, or can tell me if im actually bi. I'm fifteen years old, and I am horribly confused:         A couple weeks ago I had all my friends over. (Like eight girls all together.) We all saw a movie, and when we were walking back from the theatre, we decided we would play truth or dare when we got home.    So we're playing truth or dare and I'm dared a couple of time to kiss a few of the girls. I really didn't think anything of it, you know? It was harmless.       So we're having a lot of fun doing all the dumb dares, and telling all our secrets, and a girl dares me to kiss my best friend.   Again, I thought nothing of this. So we laughed and leaned into kiss, but when I tried to pull away I just couldn't, and neither could she.   Everyone was laughing becaue they thought we were just doing it to be funny.   But, I felt something and I know she did too.      Why is it that she was the only girl there that I felt something with?! It wasn't like that with any of the other girls!   And I have a boyfriend who I just love to be with, and I'm extremely attracted to him too!   Why is it just her??      Do you think my orientation is neither bi or straight? Do you think it might just depend on the person?      I'm just so confused. I would never date her or anything, but I just wanted to know why I felt so much more when I kissed her, than when I kiss my own boyfriend!      We've been best friends for almost four years now!    Have you ever felt something towards a girl like this? Is it just normal to want to be close to the ones you love???

I was at a wedding once where they had all their engagement photos shrunk and cut out in little circles that they scattered over the reception tables for decoration. They were really cute and my friend said she thought there was a website you can order them on and have them delivered all cut out. Does anyone know of any place you can do this?
20090309182533AAWfOmS	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I find my twin?	When my mom was pregnant with me she was told it looked like twins, multiple times. When I was born (by C-section) neither of my parents could see anything that was happening, and they said "it's a boy" then a minute or so later, changed it to "it's a girl". The dr THEN showed me to my parents, kicked my dad out of the room as they were RUSHING the incubator out of the room (I had NO complications at birth). And they knocked my mom out immediately. I have felt a connection to someone ALL OF MY LIFE, but have NO other siblings. I felt this was even before I knew this story. I feel that I need to find my other half to find something I have been missing all of my life, but I have no idea where to start. I was born at Southern Baptist Hospital in New Orleans, LA on Thursday, August 5th, 1982 in case someone knows how I can start my search for my possible brother! PLEASE HELP ME. I feel as though I am missing half of my heart, and have felt this way all of my life.
20090309182645AA2Mp4q	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm going to college, but my parents don't want me to leave home. what do i do?	I live in Riverside but will soon be attending FIDM in Los Angeles. My parents are all for me going but won't let me move out. FIDM is a very expensive school ($25000 a year) and i need their assistance in helping me pay, but they have told me if i move out, they won't pay for it. In addition to the high tuition, FIDM doesn't over dorms, only housing which will cost about $1000 a month.The most frustrating thing is I am extremely mature for my age and they still think i won't be able to handle it. i already added up ALL cost (even down to cost of forks) and have already been accepted....and I'm only 16. Does that seem immature? What do i do? drive out to LA everyday and continue living at home or move to LA to fulfill my dreams but go into massive debt with loans.  Are they being over protective...or reasonable?

20090309183309AAtdq1u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with me and my heart?	I can't seem to ever figure out if I want this girl or that girl. I'm not a player or anything. I've been with this girl, V, for along time and we break up a lot. We were off for a little less than a week and she came over today and when I'm in her presence I get this feeling in my chest and it hurts. She kissed me and the feeling went away. The problem is when we're dating I get interested in other girls and it's hard. I don't know why I'm like this. When I'm not with her, I miss her. When I am, I want a different girl. What the hell is going on?!

20090309184555AAtXGCw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help! My best friend keeps slapping my boyfriend!!!?	I'm 15 and my boyfriend and I have been dating for 7 months. My best friend is really starting to annoy me. She will slap my boyfriend - in the face - for no reason! She has left red marks and it's making me soooo mad! I mean, I don't do that to her boyfriend so why should she have the right to slap my boyfriend?? I don't know how much of a friend she is anymore. Today she kept slapping him and hit his eye! I feel like a jerk for not speaking up, but I didn't know what to do or say.I'm a terrible girlfriend! What should I do next time she tries to hit him? Should I grab her hand or block her or something, or should I ask her why she's hitting him?      She also recently told me that she flashed her boobs to a guy for money! A different guy told her to do it. The one she flashed to actually got really upset about it. And she has a boyfriend who she "wants to marry". They've only been dating for 2 months, if that. She said that if she didn't have a boyfriend, she'd do it again!       But what should I do about her being so rude to my boyfriend? Is she even worth having as a friend?? She's the one who got my boyfriend and I together, but I don't like the way she's been acting. What should I do????

20090309185526AAJO93p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy act this way?	U are starting to get to know this girl, and if you are not interested in her whatsoever, would u ever ask her to hang out with u one on one every time?       I've just watched the "He's Just Not That Into You" movie, so I know if a person is not interested in a girl, they won't bother calling you. It's actually pretty common sense.      The thing I don't get is, why would a guy be around you so much to a point where you think they like you, but they just disappear a week after that, then stop contacting all together? That guy basically being hot one day, then cold the next day. Then out of no where, maybe a month later, they talk to you as if nothing is wrong. But the end result is still ignorance.      This is when I don't know how to draw the line. Are we even friends, because friends are suppose to talk to one another instead of avoiding you.       Thanks

20090309190428AABPbyz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can i give him up completely?	background: we are both early 30s. i've like him for 1+ years apart and another 1+ years when we still meet daily.      Now we are friends who don't meet often, communicate more on IM than on outings.       He asked me to join some of his activities, but I dropped out after trying once as I'm not too keen. He spends almost all his free time in these activities. He will also give me exact dates of his schedule weirdly.       Everytime when I asked him for help, he will always remember, although his response time is really slow, like taking a month to pass me a dvd, but he always remembers it. Which makes me feel he does care about what I think of him.      I casually mentioned that i thought this movie is quite interesting and asked him if he's keen, he said he's not and I felt broken-hearted. Although frankly, he don't go cinemas at all, it's not his interest.      I'm thinking that if he like to go out with me, he will be smart enough to suggest something else. Unless he is just being platonic towards me or just plain passive?    Should i avoid him for some time and give up completely? how      Please lend your insights

20090309190547AAYiU7Z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Two Brothers and one baby Please Help?	I have very big problem. I know some of ye are most likely going to judge me or call me stupid over this but. I really need advice. Even though I think I already know the answer.    Ok so I am living with my boyfriend. He’s 19 I’m 17. His brother is 36 and sometimes when he is fighting with his girlfriend who is my two male best friends mother and my ex foster mothers sister.    One night we all went out to my boyfriend’s nephew’s birthday. While we were out a fight broke out between my boyfriend’s brother’s Girlfriend and his sister and him. At this stage I was on my 6th pint and my 5th vodka straight. So yeah I was drunk. But my boyfriend’s brothers G/Friend ended up going home and his sister was really upset. I was really drunk and said I was going to get a taxi home. I really couldn’t see straight. So I left the pub and started walking [wobbling] to the taxi rank. But then somebody pulled me back and I saw my boyfriend. He said I’ll come home with you I’m sick of that place. So off we went I feel asleep in the back of the taxi I had to be carried into the house. So we went up stairs and he started to undress me, then well I got in the mood so I pulled down his jeans and well we had sex.    Then I fell asleep I felt him get out of the bad but didn’t think much of it. Around an hour later I felt him get back in. He was very touchy feely and we done it ‘again’. When we woke up in the morning I said to him you were only up for it twice last night tut tut just making a laugh of it. The he goes we only done it once then you passed out. I thought he was to drunk to remember. So I asked him what he thought of the night, and he goes well I waited around two hours after you left and my sis cheered up so it was alright. I was like what? Who came home with me and he was like my brother, yeah he stayed after the fight last night. So then it clicked when my boyfriend went in for a shower I went to his brother and asked him and he said yes it did happen. Btw they look identical!! So I was very shocked but couldn’t face telling my boyfriend. Then I found out I am pregnant, I’m 2 months gone and the dates match up to that night as far as I can tell!! I haven’t told anybody yet. But I just don’t know what to do; I could be having my boyfriend’s brother’s baby?! Any advice please

20090309184812AA6JlR8	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you do when your biological family finds you?	I was adopted when I was a baby.  I live with my biological half brother and parents who adopted both of us.  I knew I had another brother, but never really believed it.  Well, a week ago my mysterious brother found me on Myspace.  I was shocked.  Apparently he has a kid, so not only do I find a brother I didn't believe I had, I'm an aunt.      My biological mother now knows that I'm talking to him and wants to start talking to me.  I'm not really sure how to go about this since I haven't heard from any of them for more than 15 years.  (I'm 17)       Another complicated detail is that I can't tell my adoptive parents about it since I'm not really supposed to be on myspace.        Should I start talking to my biological family?
20090309190350AATvtII	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he want to do stuff ?	my boyfriend is such a sweetheart and we get along so well.. the only problem is that he soooo respectful of me and wont try anything because i think he thinks i dont want to or that im affraid, im not but how do i get him to understand that. he is also religious though so that might have some impact on it but if were not having sex we can still do other stuff right?   he is also a fifth year in high school and im a grade 11 so he most likely wants to do stuff, he just hasnt really fooled around before.. he is really hot though lol so i want him to with me

He seems nice, but I'm not sure I can see myself dating this person. First, there's the age difference. Then there's the whole "what could we possibly have in common?!" question that's been in the back of my mind for days. Are my doubts reasonable or am I just being an arrogant brat? :(

20090309184104AAqKXAi	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ever Had Your Pants Pulled Down?	I am currently 26 and just started my office job working for a banking company so I obviously thought I had left all this childish humour behind me, but clearly I was wrong. Last friday was pyjama day so I wore my pyjama bottoms with a regular t-shirt on. Also on fridays we have a yoga class in the lunch room during break time. I was the only guy who ever participated in this class, which didnt bother me because it meant more girls for me to flirt with. While anyway during last class while I was stretching and reaching up to the ceiling one of my guy friends at the office decides to run up and pull my pyjama pants to the ground exposing my underwear to everyone in the general area. Worste of all, that day I happened to wear this really embarrassing pair of Calvin Klein briefs, which were tight, white and revealing, and basically skimpy underwear for a guy to be wearing. So I bent down and picked up my pants while all the ladies doing yoga with me got a good giggle out of it and then I turned around and their were like ten other people all looking at me with a smirk on their face, their was even a group of old ladies by the water cooler who were talking and laughing about it. I was so embarrassed but I continued with the class and then after lunch my friend who pulled down my pants came up to me and said ``hey sorry about that man, I just had to, I didnt realize you wore such embarrassing underwear`` I just said dont worry about it and tried to forget about it. But my god, it felt like grade school all over again, how embarrassing!
20090309184641AAqgR42	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I file a dispute for a Divorce?	Hey guys and gals,      My wife filed for divorce under Extreme Cruelty in the state of NJ. I cant afford a lawyer, but a friend of mine asked for a favor and I was able to sit with a one for a while asking him questions and explaining my case. He gave me advice for my Child Custody hearing, which went well, and he briefly touched on the divorce. He told that whether I want it or not, if my wife wants to get divorced it will happen, even if I refuse to sign anything. He wasnt mean, he just wanted to be really clear with about things. I told him that the reasons she filed were false and that I wanted to dispute it. He said something about having to file an "Answer" in which I have 3 options. I was so emotional during the time that I didn't write everything down. You see, I still love my wife and all, but lets get back to the subject. I believe he said that I can file an Answer in which I do not deny any of her 5 reasons for the divorce, one that I do deny them, and the third I dont remember clearly.   I want to dispute the divorce, because all 5 of her reasons are not true. I have a lot of evidence to prove my case. I was wondering if anyone could assist me or give me advice in regards to this? Where can I find this form? What exactly should I write? Any additional will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
20090309185426AAxGqM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are guys so complicated?	there's this guy in my class that i like. the thing is i don't know if he likes me.

When i ignore him he tries to flirt but when i talk to him he says nothing but just stares. I don't understand, does he like me or not. And if he does how do i approach a guy like him. He also flirts with a lot of girls in front of me and it bugs me. How can i get him to notice.

20090309185635AAojQRo	Family & Relationships;Friends	What excuse could I give my friend ?	My friend is going bankrupt and he wants to give me his trunk so that I'll be able to put it under my insurance( not really give just put the truck under my name like its mine, but its really his truck) so that he'll be able to keep his truck. The thing is he's really irresponsible and doesnt drive that good so if he gets into an accident it might affect my insurance. So I dont want to do it since its also fraud. Whats a good excuse I can give him for not being able to put his truck under my insurance ? Keep in my mind that he will be giving me money to pay for his insurance so the excuse " I cant afford it" cant work.

20090309191149AAguooD	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do?????	ok, my cousin is 10 years old, and his parents are divorced. He has a learning disorder, and he lives with his mom. Yesterday he took his shirt off, and me and my grandma, noticed he had about 15 large scratches all over his back. At first he wouldn't tell us, but later said his mom done it, because he was "aggravating" his brother. This isn't the first time something has happened. One time he had a black eye, and said his mom accidentally hit him. Another time he had a deep cut on his hand, and told me his mom done it with a staple. I think she's on drugs..she drinks/parties..and she's a whore      My grandma told my uncle (Patrick's father) about it, and he's not doing anything..I don't understand how he can sit back, allowing his child to be abused. He hasn't even offered to get custody of patrick!...I don't know what to do..me and my grandma is scared she's going to really hurt patrick..and my grandma would love for him to come live with her...is there anything i could do, because i'm only 17..

20090309191522AAKGBwP	Family & Relationships;Friends	My long-distance best friend doesn't respect personal property, like prescription meds, and is visiting soon!?	My best friend lives in another state, and I see her about once or twice a year, but we talk everyday.  We were roommates several years ago for a year, and since then we have been in different states.      She has serious social shyness, and sometimes drinks to make herself feel better (but not often enough for it to be a problem).  About two years ago her and our mutual friend stole some of their friend, Holly's, Adderall to try it for fun because ''Holly doesn't really need it, and she is rich anyways and can buy more''.  They ended up taking a third of the pills in the bottle between the two of them!      She never mentioned doing anything like that again, until yesterday.  She was anxious about a date and had an upset stomach so didn't want to drink.  Instead she went in Holly's room (they are all roommates now), and went through her stuff looking for Adderall to take to ''calm her down'' (i know, i know, stupid idea).      The problem is she is coming to visit me for a week and she knows that I take medicine, one of which is similair to Adderall.  The other is a sleeping med that would be dangerous if abused, and it is also very expensive.      I'm concerned that she is going to take some of my meds 'for fun' and I'm not sure what to do about it.  How should I hide my medicine from her?  I'm really bothered because she wasn't like this when we roomed together, and she doesn't do other drugs or even drink regularly.

He is recent to Milwaukee  going out plenty alone but has not met anyone.  I tried to use free services. He asks me to publish his number of six one zero zero four two one so that his time and money can be shared with someone.  He would really like to meet someone permanent and have a child or two.  He designs transmissions. The few men he works with are married-He doesn't know them too well to ask them to fix him up.  He asked me but every service I found on the net won't let you get the service free for two weeks until you pay for at least one month first, so ok but THEN they let you put out a profile w/no way to contact anyone or be contacted back as u can not give your tele num so they have to reach you by computer. He doesn't want to spend all of his work and home time at onenor do I So he asked me to help ladies call.

I do all my work usually before the due dates, i pay attention in class as well as actively participate, and overall, i am just a good person. i have a great personality, and i guess you could say that i am a teacher's pet.      One of my male teachers often makes sexual references in class, and it often seems as if they are directed towards me.  for example, i once walked up on a conversation and quickly walked away (while covering my ears) and said, "ah, my virgin ears; i'm going to sit down now". a few minutes passed, and then he came up to me and said, "i hope that's not the only thing that's virgin about you".       He often tells me i'm cute, and smiles at me all the time.  i don't intentionally flirt with him, but sometimes i will admit that i can be a little TOO nice.      This morning i woke up panting with my forehead soaking wet.  i had a dream about him and in the dream we had sex.  i know, that sounds so disgusting but it's the truth.  i don't know what this dreams means, but i know that i felt uncomfortable having it, but deep down there was a kind of passion..like the "undercover rebel" inside of me wanted to do it.      Uhh i don't know what to do.  Please help...?      Any feedback would be appreciated. :)
20090309191632AAQMUSe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do a lot of men resist paying child support?  I have only met one man in my life, and I am 40, that paid?	gladly, and often gave above his child support when his children wanted other things the mom couldn't afford.  Why do so many dads literally want to have nothing to do with the financial support of their children?  I just don't get it.
20060824094021AAYBrk4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do we women (especially black women) put up with so much from our man?	It always astounds me to see how much a woman will take from her man.  This is especially true when it come to black women.  It seems that we have come to accept everything from a man whether it's infdelity, or tragically, even HIV/AIDS. Why don't we have enough self-worth to ask for and expect only the best from our men?  Is it that, underneath our neck-twisting and diva attitude, we really are insecure?  Is it the male to female ratio?  Why do we always allow the man to keep the ball in his court? I am also curious to hear your responses. Men are welcome to answer as well.

20090309194014AAm0bM2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	To women with husbands and kids?	I have always felt outside with my friends because they all talk about growing up getting married and having little Bobbys and Katies.( kids) Most of my friends are only 15 and 16. I don't understand how they feel this way. In my family women don't pick "good" men. They beat them and slander their names with family.    My question is why do women get married and have kids when there seems to be so much more freedom and independence when a woman is single?   all answers welcomed, from all different faiths.

20090309200528AAVxYEF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Idea to surprise my husband for his birthday this weekend?	Hi guys,      My husband's birthday is this weekend and I want to surprise him but I don't know how to go about it.  He has really been stressed about turning 29 and stress overall.So I wanted to do something special for him. I rented a nice hotel room here in town, and I was thinking of leading him to a treasure hunt in finding the hotel and the room. I was going to ask the front desk to give him an extra key at the front desk for him, that way he can come into the room and surprise him.      I plan on packing our overnight bags beforehand and putting them in my car so that he won't suspect anything.   I was planning on having flowers, chocolates, and candles all over the hotel room. My husband always says that women never romance men. So I thought this would be a creative way.  I also bought him a new dress watch which he has been hinting at. So I think he will love it.      Do you guys think this a good idea? Or do you guys have anything else that you think I can do to make it special?      I will be cooking him breakfast and taking him to dinner at a nice restaurant.   Do you guys ha

Today I asked my friend if he was ready for his volleyball game and he said no, and i said why? and he said cause we're gonna lose! and i said don't say that, and they ended up losing. I know because my friend told me.   I haven't talked to him yet, I will tomorrow   When I see him I'm going to say how was your game? and obviously he will say we lost. Should I say "Really? You should have had more confidence in yourself, Its nice when guys are confident about something, but not cocky about it"         Is that good to say?   Do you have any suggestions?         P.S.

20090309195350AA4w9aZ	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad won't let me drive in town?	I'm 15 withy my permit. I understand that he wont let me drive in town for the first little bit, but I drive two or three times a week and have 16 hours in already! I'm not talkin like the big part of town, I'm talkin a little town. It has a lot of traffic, sure, but the worse thing to worry about is an intersection with a stop light and the right turn only lanes. I've asked numerous times if he'd let me, but he says I'm not experienced enough. How can i get experienced if he only  lets me drive on a deserted highway (the same route every time)? I told him that I couldn't get better just by driving the same highway over and over and he said, well, not today. (as in i can't drive in town) I know hes nervous but hes got to let go. How can I help him understand that I need practice? I really do feel ready. When I first got my permit I wasn't, but now I am.

This 18 year old ***** that my husband was basically a big brother to years ago, as they are 10 years apart and he knew her older brother is acting extremely immature.   She said my "fetus" was keeping my husband from being happy and he doesn't want to be with me anymore, keyed our car, etc. She is mentally insane, and I usually have some sympathy for the mentally ill, but being pregnant I can't deal with her ******** anymore. He promised to cut contact with her many times and always ends up back in contact, and making me stressed and in tears over her **** again, he doesn't even think about me. I don't trust him anymore and I think my nagging is useless and for the sake of my baby I feel I will have to leave him due to this situation.      What should I do? It's not like there is anything I can even do for her, she needs to be in a PSYCHIATRIC ward. If it comes down to it I would knock her out myself for the sake of my baby, she has no rules or boundries and my husband is an idiot. What kind of 28 year old man can't cut contact with and 18 year old freak???

20090309204949AAu4mDv	Family & Relationships;Family	Why would a parent do something like this...? 10 points?	My last 3 relationships have many things in common that with time during those relatioships u only confied and trust the person your with.. but in some way it troubles me.. because they all had been abused as a child not sexually.. but mentally , physically, emotionally.. my husband who past away few years ago told me about his childhood which was a sad one but that left a scar  emotionally his mother had taken him to another city and had dumped him left alone at age 7 didnt know anyone and he had to beg to be able to have food..till one day an auntie found him and brought him  home just to suffer physical abuse by the stepdad..       the other person i was in volved with at one time also had an abusive father who we know belived might have been mentally disturbed .. to the point that he thought dancing like elvis was evil and with the metal of a belt hit him accross the face soo hard that it broke his jaw he was about 4 yrs old.. and many other things he remembers.      Now my actual partner was abandon as a child 6 yrs at a hospital by her mother who gave a nurse a note after she had told my partner to wait in the waiting room she  needed to use the restroom but never came back to get her.. the nurse read the letter  sayin she was abadoning her cause she couldnt take care of her..and not only did she abandon her but gave away her brothers and twin sister.. mom was an alcholic on on drugs  at the time.. father was away working and manage to get all the kids back and have them in  with his parents helping him raise them as he worked to provide them..       But why would a parent do that to their children? why the abuse? dont they realize the emotional and mental  stage those kids  live  with for the rest of their lives because they werent loved? but abuse and hurt? can anyone tell me why? and how do i help my partner who today is 22 yrs old and still feels the pain of being abandon..how can i help her ? i love her ..

20090309201136AAVTZYV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my boyfriend back?	Ok, today is Monday March 9th, 2009. My boyfriend broke up with me Thursday March 5th. One day before our 8th month anniversary.      Anyways, we were in long distance relationship for about 5 1/2 of those months. I went to college 300 miles away from our city. I would have never went to this college if I had met him sooner though.      He was very easy going while breaking up with me, he said it was all him and had nothing to do with me. He said he felt different and wasn't that in love with me anymore, and it wasn't fair to me to keeping pretending like he was. And as I was hearing everything he was saying, I start bawling and asking him questions. He starts crying too, so I know he did this with the best intentions.      I was, and still am, devastated. It hurts so much to know that you can no longer tell the person you're deeply in love with that you love them.       However, we have been talking on the phone ever since we broke up. Only about once a day though, and we don't text. He and I both know we would be a HUGE mess if we just shut off our communication. Especially me, I don't have a lot of friends at my college, so I relied on him so much to keep  me happy being so far away from home.       I want nothing more than to have him back in my arms. I miss more than ever right now, and I'm still so in love with him. I need help how I can get him back. I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I know there is a possibillity that we might get back together, because he has mentioned it twice by saying "just give me some time" and "who knows we might get back together, we'll be going to the same school". I'm going to school there in the fall.      So please I need help. I don't want to ruin the potential. I want real answers, not stupid one liners, like find someone else.      Thanks.

Even when you feel youre in love but you think youve put yourself out there enough and you dont feel anything reciprocal. youre afraid to ruin the good thing you got going but you cant really think about anything else. you always come so close to just saying it but the sheer terror of rejection is enough to paralyze you, fake smiles. is the torture just meant to be this way?

Everytime we hang out though it seems like we watch a movie, which I don't mind but I want to change things up a bit.

20090309200243AAbnIzh	Family & Relationships;Friends	What did I do wrong to make her hate me?	Okay long story short, I was good friends with this girl a couple of years ago. I told her my feelings and she ignored me and over the past 2 years she either ignore me or became friends with me as it kept going back and forth. I still like her.      Okay now a couple of weeks ago she decided to talk to me again for the first time in like 4 months. She told me she didn't hate me anymore and so we had a nice conversation. She knows that I liker her as her friend asked me that earlier.The next day we also had a great conversation, said she didn't like me and don't want me to get the wrong idea and then added her on facebook later on. She didn't accept my invitation nor did she ignore it but she just didn't do anything to it as she did some other things on her facebook.      So I don't get to see her until Monday as it was Friday since we talked and the rest of the week I didn't really get to talk to her. On Monday I said hi to her and then on Friday I talked to her briefly on how she didn't talk to me the whole week, she just said that's unfortunate and din't really bothered. Then today I tried talking to her but she just ignored me and walked as fast as she can away from me. Later during the day I noticed she blocked me from facebook.      I honestly have no idea what I did wrong. I didn't really say much to her and nothing I said was really insulting to her as we had good friendly conversations with each other. She's really confusing as she said she didn't hate me a couple weeks ago and now she hates me even though I only said like no more than 20 words to her between that time.      BTW:During the week when I couldn't talk to her, I didn't have a lot of chances to talk with her so I only talked to her once that week and said hi to her that's it

My husband and I have had trust and communication issues in the past due to some things I found in his email and on his facebook. He told me I had nothing to worry about, that the girl was just a jealous lying ex gf from before we met. But he has since changed all his passwords and refuses to give them to me which makes me feel he's hiding things. He says its cuz I start problems with his friends. I did message a few girls on his facebook as him but it was only because his ex put it in my mind that he was cheating on me

20090309202454AAeHlD9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I tell my husband I need help?	My husband and I are not on good terms right now. We just had our second child 3 months ago and because of our issues, we're on a waiting list to start counselling. I don't know if we'll even make it that far.      We're currently sleeping separately. Part of me wants to leave him, but I don't want to make that decision and it turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life. Any time I try to talk to him, he brushes me off.       I honestly think I'm suffering post-partum depression, and I don't feel like I can turn to him for help. I'm afraid to even say anythig to hom, for fear that he'll brush me off. But at the same time, I want help, and feel like he's where I can start.      I'm in tears over this the last few days, crying as I type this.      How can I approach him and ask him for help?
20090309200511AAyAEjN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex keeps trying to interfere with my life.?	We have been broken up for about a month.   So it hasn't been a long time. But he keeps acting like I am still his girlfriend. He is still very protective. Some how he found out I had this fling thing with another guy and he was like "Who the f is he" and he was really mad and. stuff. Or if he sees me talking to a guy, even if he is a friend, he will ask me all kinds of questions. I just don't really know what to do, we were together for about a year so I can understand he still has feelings for me but he shouldn't be trying to control my life. Should he?

20090309194559AAHB8ty	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is everybody hating on our relationship?	My girlfriend's friends and my friends hate our relationship. It is pretty annoying seeing how we are both considerate of others feelings, yet somehow people don't care about ours. If we stop seeing each other we'll be miserable while everyone else is happy; on the other hand if we stay together close friendships are at stake. I really wish people weren't so immature. BTW, I'm not in high school which makes this situation even more ridiculous.

20090309195003AAMV8pl	Family & Relationships;Family	How to handle newly homeless relatives?	My wife's sister and her family are now homeless. Her husband was a National Guardsman. In 2005 he went to to Iraq. He went again in 2007. Both times he was deployed they fell behind on their mortgage, as he made a lot more as a civilian. After the 2nd deployment, the company couldn't really take him back. They did give him a "make work" job that represented a 30% pay cut for a few months, but eventually let him go. He's not been able to find a good job. Since 2005, they have been late with mortgage at least 1/3 of the time. Since last summer, they actually missed two payments. Last month the bank demanded the two payments they were behind immediately. Couldn't do it.Couldn't make any more deals. They have moved most of their stuff to my house, which is now stuffed. They will be homeless as of Friday. Nobody is thrilled. I have a 3 bedroom, 1 bath house that is 80 years old. Only about 1,100 sf. Now it is home to my wife, myself, my child and my cat. It is about to have my sister-in-law, her husband, their 2 children, their dog, their cat and their stuff. It isn't going to fit. 7 people, one bathroom... what are we going to do? Thanks.

Sometimes he hits me when i "bug" him... and of course... since its hard for me to think before i act, i don't really have an anger problem, its just that my brother thinks he can hit me and not get in trouble...if i hit back ever... he calls it abuse, or yells louder for dad to hear... sometimes i leave a mark when i hit him back...so yeah... is it abuse? or Brotherly love :P

20090309191830AAk2icO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need some advice please?	Here's my story. A little over a year ago I caught my husband texting and calling a girl that he worked with. He got caught because she texted him on a day that I was suppose to be working, but had to call in because I was pregnant and had to stay home sick. Well, to make that long story short, I confronted him on it and he cried and said that it would never happen again. I told him that it better not or I would leave and take the baby with me. Well, the baby is now just over a year old and I am 18 weeks pregnant with our next baby. He had been acting strange again lately and I had my concerns, so I went onto his myspace account today and sure enough he has been sending messages back and forth with an ex girlfriend. The messages are mostly her saying "what if" and things like that, but he did say that he still thinks about her and that he still thinks "what if" himself. We've had a great marriage since this other stuff a year ago and now I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thanks in advance.

He came over to my house and would just stand by the door and look out the eyepiece where you can see who's at the door.   -I would talk to him, but he'd just stare at me.      Later he came again and was monitoring everything I was doing.   I was chatting with a friend about an airsoft gun event and he says, "What's with the guns?" He just stares at me pissed.   His eyes start to water, I listen and say, "I'm all ears."   He just stares at me and says, "Sometimes I feel like people are after me."   I wonder, what does he mean?   Later he sees a square with a lid over it on my ceiling and asks, "Can you go up there?" I'm like probably since there is something covering that hole. He just stares at me more and walks.      I'm very worried and confused. Please tell me what's going on with him.      P.S. He's also very mature and leader-like.
20090309192826AAEj9oD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need help with a custody battle...?	My cousin is fighting her ex-boyfriend for custody of their (extremely cute) little girl, Shelby. It's been a long struggle, but it's kind of obvious she should be with her mother. My question is this:      Now that Shelby's gone with her daddy, they've stopped her potty training. She also refuses to feed herself, and instead makes you feed her. Her mother's fiancee, whom Shelby calls "daddy", has been snubbed. Shelby refuses to talk with him, let him hug her, etc. She calls her biological father "de da". She has been saying "no" and "I can't" a lot, which she didn't do before. She's happy at the dropoff, when she leaves mommy, and she cries when mommy gets her back. We expect it's because she finds "de da" a toy, since he buys her things and lets her do whatever she wants. She eats whatever she wants, she wears whatever she wants, and she seeps whenever she wants. "De da" never tells mommy what she ate, etc.      Like I said, this has taken quite a toll on her behavior. How will her behavior stand up in court?      ((BTW "De da" has two DUI's, a suspended license, two counts of aggravated assault, and is suspected of both child abuse and rape. Mommy wrecked three cars. That's the criminal record. Decide who Selby goes with. ;-)        Thanks for your help!!))

20090309193812AAPtLmP	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is the fact that my daughter does not have many friends in her school a reason to look elsewhere?	She is in a small private school. We like the education she is getting. BUT, girls are mean to her (ignore her, whisper in front of her, exclude her as if she doesn't exist).  I could go on forever with the stories - and have seen some of it happen before my eyes.  Individually most girls seem fine but when the group comes together she is the outsider.  After 6 years of these same girls (6th grade) this has got to be hard on my daughter.  Perhaps a school with more than 10 girls in the class would offer more friendships too.  The problem - we like the teachers and the education.  The teachers like her too.  There are some other choices in the area - some more expensive and others cheaper.  Do we let her visit them and see how she feels about it?  What are we teaching her - to run away from it?  In the last year we've purposely encouraged her outside activities to be just that - OUTSIDE of school - no more school sports or clubs etc. since we figured a whole day with this group is enough (she doesn't realize that is the reason, and she actually excels at these activities outside of school).  After seeing all this during a recent school activity, I've had enough.  She is kind of num.  Today she says school was "OK".  I don't know what to do.

20090309195018AAEvo0h	Family & Relationships;Family	Need help making decision - teenager and college?	Looking for advice on what to do with my 17 year old daughter and her upcoming start in college. She is due to start college this summer at an expensive art and design school where all the financing has been secured - she's good to go. However she started dating a guy (20) about a month or so ago and seems to have given up everything for this guy - he's her first "real" boyfriend. I don't begrudge her having a boyfriend, however I think he is a bit controlling and my daughter seems to be giving into it (as well as being somewhat manipulative herself when it comes to the guy). She has started to express that she isn't as interested as she once was in going to college and I'm worried that she may go and mess it up and spend all of her free time -and then some - with the new guy; who by then she will be living closer to since her college is about halfway between our home and his. I've invested a lot of money into her pending education and frankly don't want to blow it if she is just going up there to hang with the guy more often. I have 2 other kids to consider and another one headed to college soon who has remained more serious about getting his education once the time comes.      Any input would be great because my daughter and I are nothing alike personality-wise and we don't always relate to one another very well. When I was her age I was very serious and not into the dating scene nearly as much as she is (I am quiet and introverted while she is very outgoing). I don't want to pull the rug out from underneath her but don't want to lose a lot of money because she's young and thinks she's in love......and she also happens to be very impulsive.       Should I pull the plug or wait until her July start is a little closer?
20090309195135AAlbiTN	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm jealous and scared? How can I try and overcome this?	Well I'm jealous of my friend who has a boyfriend. They right stuff about each other on their my spaces and says "o she's beautiful" and "he's awesome" and they said I love you at the end of it.): It makes me jealous because I've never had a boyfriend and it sort of makes me upset that she does. I'm incredibly happy for her and wouldn't dare do anything to tear them apart but im so jealous! I'm also jealous of my other friend I think is wayyyyyyy prettier than me and it hurts my feelings and makes me feel like im not pretty at all. She just started texting this guy who thinks shes hott(she sent him a picture) and this guy i've liked for a while ALWAYS flirts with her and he really likes her, and she tells me everything he says to her and what happens between them when im not around,):  Im also scared because all of my friends are starting to branch out and meet new people. I'm scared I wont be able to do that and they will begin to loose interest in me as a friend because they have met new people. How can I branch out and be more confident? Middle School is coming up so it adds the stress on my shoulder. Thank you!               -Amelia<3

20090309195351AAMKnS9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I found the engagement ring after 15 years. Keep it or send it back?	I was going through my "memory box" and found an engagement ring from 15 years ago. I swear I thought I had returned it..it was down in the corner under a flap. My ex lives 2500 miles away and we haven't spoken in 11 years. Last I heard he had gotten married, and I certainly don't want to make waves with his marriage. I still have his father's phone number and address. I was thinking of just mailing it to his father with a short note. Is that a good idea, or should I just keep it since it has been so long?  It is a fairly nice ring, not a cheapie by any means. After all this time, what in the heck am I supposed to do??

20090309200005AAGh4Iy	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do in this situation?	My sister got this job about a year ago. She absolutely loves this job and makes good money from it. However, my and my mother dislike how she is always out so late. She is like never home! At the times she is home, she's either getting ready for a meeting with them or sleeping. Every time I'm talking to her, she's texting her co-workers as we talk. All she talks about is them.       She says she hates being at home because she feels trapped and suffocated. Huh? She's been very content with staying at home all the time before this job. Plus, every time she talks to my mom now, my mom starts to bring up that she feels my sister should be at home a bit more, my sister blows up.       My mom seemed ok with her job for a long time until my sister wanted to go to Utah for a business trip. My mom didn't allow it because the transportation seemed unsafe (they were going to get there by car). My sister through a fit and secretly paid for the trip, thinking she would convince our mom by the day of the trip. My mom found out and yelled at her telling her "You want to run away or something? What if I don't say yes? What will you do? You paid behind my back! So are you going to runaway to Utah with them?!" It was really scary. As my mom yelled at her, I couldn't help but think that my mom took the words out of my mouth.       My sister now gets only 5 or less hours of sleep every night. That doesn't seem right for her! One day, I woke up at six in the morning and found her outside trying to get in the house. She said that around 11 o clock the night before, her friends from her job invited her out to eat. She left the house secretly and came back around one o clock. She forgot her key and no one in our house was awak at the time SO SHE SLEPT IN THE RESTAURANT SHE ATE AT EARLIER! This is really not good for her.      Recently, my mom was waiting for my sister to come home and at 1 my sister came through the doors.      Mom: Oh, you're finally home! :D *looks at her* Whose bag is that?   Sister: *looks at bag* Oh, this belong to Josh. He and his friends are coming here soon.   Mom: For what? A meeting?   Sister: Oh no, they are just here to relax! :]   *four men come in the house*   Sister: Mom, can I take them to my room?   Mom: :[ No. You stay down here. I'm going upstairs.Your room is too small for them! In fact,why don't you use my room?!   Sister: Oh no, mom. It's ok. We'll stay down here.   Mom: *storms off*      My mom went to sleep and woke up at 1:30. She went downstairs and found them watching a movie and cooking and all that stuff. She turned on the TV and told them she would stay up as long as they do so she can see what time her daughter goes to bed. They immediately leave after she says that. She and my sister then start arguing again.      I really can't take it anymore. Watching this is really painful for me. I would talk to my sister telling her my opinion on this but when she talks to me about her job, she seems so happy and content. I really don't want her to quit her job and be miserable and I don't want her to feel suffocated around me too. When she and I get to talk, I feel so happy because she doesn't seem to grumpy like I usually see her (unless she's with THEM). However, it really makes me sad and annoyed when I watch her run out the door in the morning and not see her till the next.       So what should i do?
20090309200005AAXDEKz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have become the other woman.....and I'm falling for the guy.  What should I do?	I need some serious, nonjudgemental advice.  There's a man that I work with that I've been attracted to for quite some time.  We flirt with each other constantly while at work, and we've hung out a couple of times - he lives in my condo complex.  The problem is that he lives in this complex with his girlfriend.....and they've been together for several years.  I went over to hang out the other night (while she was out of town) and we were just talking, drinking, looking at stupid nerdy videos on youtube.  Then, he spoke a little about his relationship, and how it's not fulfilling, and how unhappy he is.  I know that this sounds like a classic story, and how cliche it is that we ended up hooking up, but even before this happened I felt like there was more between us than a couple of people who flirted at work.  Now, I think I'm falling for him, and I don't know what to do.  I know there's the old adage that if he cheated on her, that he would cheat on me, and I know that I shouldn't want to take it any further, but I do.  Now, when I see him at the office, it's incredibly awkward, and I don't know what to do.  I know that I have no right to expect anything to happen, especially since he has a girlfriend, but I really want it to.  Please help me, I have no one to ask about this.

20090309202337AAE0wbJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to catch a cheating husband?	I think I have a cheating husband. I want to know how to catch a cheating husband so I can find out where to go from here. I don't know if I should continue on with our relationship, or divorce him so I really need to find out if he is cheating on me or not. I have a feeling he is because the way he acts around me has changed so much compared to how we used to interact a year ago. Now he is cold, and uncaring. He gets mad at me when I ask where he has been all night. Sometimes, usually fridays, I wake up past midnight around 1 to 2 AM and he's just getting home. I feel really bad for thinking about things like this, because it might turn out to be true, but I have to know if I have a cheating husband so I can move on.      I tried asking him if he is having an affair, but he just gets mad and defensive, that's why I want to know how to catch a cheating husband. I know all the signs of a cheating husband are there, I just need to catch him or get evidence that he is cheating then I'm off.

I don't want to date him, but i really want to go to our grad dance with him.

20090309203829AAP4nyO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell my girlfriend that I cheated on her?	I was out two weekends ago with my friends and got very drunk.  There was this girl who was at the bar who I had absolutely no interest in whatsoever...she was attractive physically but mentally and personality wise she is never the type of person I would ever date.      I was trying to avoid her all night, but she kept following me around, and we ended up grinding and such all night.  We didn't go as far as making out even, but there was a bit of kissing going on.      Now I know this may seem somewhat tame, as we never even got past first base.  I'm not going to debate what constitutes cheating...there are tons of questions about that on here.  But I feel extremely guilty about it, and I know my girlfriend will be able to tell something is wrong when I see her this weekend.  Should I tell her about what happened, or just not mention it and ensure that it never happens again?

He said he wanted to get back together and start over where we left off when we broke up. Which was about a month ago. He said that he had the best thing in front of him the whole time and he didn't even know it. He said he knows and now and he wants to be with me. He begged me to stay with him last night. I did, I got up with morning and went to work. I'm confused. He wants to move back in with him too. I don't know what to do.

20061228185902AAYMkVY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Another one of those situations for ya, a little long, but help is greatly appreciated?	Here's t/story. I started talking to this guy online around 3 months ago, & from t/beginning he made me smile & seemed like a nice person. We have so many things in common & we can laugh for almost anything. After a while he asked for my number & we began to talk on t/phone as well as online, but I really didn't think much of it.      On Christmas day he asked what I was doing, & invited me to t/movies, I accepted. Once there we had to wait for t/movie to begin, so we went to Dunkin' Donuts to get something to drink & sat outside talking about almost everything & anything.       He was very respectful the entire time, opened doors for me, basically the works! Long story short @  t/end of t/night, he drove me back to my car & we just sat in his car talking a while longer, thing is t/moment felt right, t/mood was set (romantic song playing in t/background & all w/out it being planned lol)..so we kissed, & laid back in his arms a while doing nothing..

20070618205305AAHfB2N	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I dont understand, any theories?	I dont understand why people cheat on each other and be unfaithful and disloyal, how can someone say they love another person when they can just as easily go out and be unfaithful? Or why do people get married and make an oath yet go out and break it like it meant nothing? I just dont understand how people can do that to each other especially when they claim to love and care about the other person! I look at my grandparents who have been married their whole lives and never once been unfaithful and wonder what happened with people in today's generation? Any suggestions on why?

The world is so huge,      but there is no safety,      we both must take refuge.

20070428014835AA9iV8e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know I posted this alreadyy, but I need more advice...?	I have known this guy for about 4 years now. Just recently we have begun to talk to eachother again. A friend of mine has told me clearly that she 'knows' he has a crush perhaps on me because of something that has happened recently. Last weekend I had come back from the club and my 'guy friend' called me to ask if I was still coming over to his house. (Earlier I had called him to tell him I would be coming to his house) I told him that I was already home and had changed my clothes He said "ok well I was going to say i have a car, but nevermind." I physically slapped my forehead for being so naive, so I persuaded him to come pick me up and he did. He came to my house to pick me up at 2 AM. We were at his house and we watched a DVD but at the corner of my eye I noticeed that he would glance at me for a long period of time and then turn away. Also, he playfully slapped my thigh like 5 times. Oh and I gave him a scratch on his arm and he asked me to make it feel better- a kiss on his arm.

My friends keep telling my that i am going to end up marrying him and that we should go back out and i feel bad for his girlfriend because everyone keeps saying that. I do love him, but like a brother not like a boyfriend.      I think she may be jelous because we hang out a LOT because he is my best friend and i tell him  everything. I just feel awful!

20061124070655AApzNKG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends????????	Ok so I'm a senior in high school and I'd say I have a lot of acquaintances. Pretty much everybody likes me enough as an acquaintance anyway. I don't think anybody hates me or anything. But the thing is I don't know why I don't get invited to hang out with people more. Everybody seems to like me but they never want me to do anything with them. I don't know why. It's always kind of been this way. There are only a few reasons I can figure out why. For years I was best frieds with this girl who was really unpopular, but I know that didn't damage me socially. Still I feel like it limited my social life a little bit because I felt obligated to her and she moved back and forth a few times and I felt like I had to wait for her because if she didn't have me she wouldn't have any friends at the school. SHe's moved permanently now and has been for 2 years. Another reason is because I haven't really gone to parties or hung out with people that much in the past. They've still liked me though. I guess another reason is that I'm just shy. I think I might have social anxiety disorder even. And I'm quiet. So people might not think I'm having a good time with them or not think I'm fun but I love spending time with them I just don't talk much. I know one person suggested trying to be louder and funnier and that's a good idea but I think they like me for being quiet and nice and that;s more my personality, It's my senior year though and I'd like to spend more time otuside of school with them, particularly with one group, and I feel like I'm closer than I've ever been to really being good friends with them but I just don't know how to get closer to them and spend more time with them. I think sitting at their lunch table might help. I just don't know what else to do. I know they really like me but I just don't know how or if I'll ever get just that little bit closer with them. What do you think?

20061121180417AA6TA6Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do?	I am in the 9th grade and when I first came into high skool I met this girl named Danielle. We started off good she told me that I was her best friend and I told her that she was mine. Then, one day she told me that someone told her not to hang around me bcuz I was lame of whatever and that I never had a boyfriend(which is not true). I asked her who said it and she refused to tell me all she said was that they didnt sit at the same table as we do at lunch. Well, since then she has stopped speaking to me (only when she wants some candy) and she follows this girl named Jecoria around. I know Jecoria isn't the one who said it because she sits at our table and Jecoria is my friend(just my not close friend). I know that I should be happy because that shows me that she wasnt a real friend anyway but I miss having someone to talk to at lunch.  I have other friends but just about all of them are either bisexual (people would think Im bi if i hung around them) or in higher grades than I am.

20061120150745AAtsYvy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long problem please help though?	i had a slight arguement with my friend today. Where she offered me a ride home and i wouldnt take it   she wanted to know why i wouldnt take it and why i push people away   i basically told her that she never has to worry about me   shes says that she just wants to help and cares that if i ever needed her she was there      then she sent me an email saying this          I just wanted to apologize for how hard I pushed you tonight. I had absolutely no right to butt into your personal buisness like I did. I hope that you can forgive me. Just please understand that it hurts me so much to see my friends in pain. And no, you are  not  "dragging me down" and yes, I  do  care, and I care on my own free will. I'm truly greatful that you accepted my offer for the ride because you live a long ways away. Know this: if you need me, I'm here for you...and I know Will is too. You've helped me so much in the past, I wouldn't be as happy as I am now if it weren't for you...so please let me do something for you in return. Even if what you is for me to stay away now, I will. I apologize again. Good night mon ami.      Your friend   Christa          so then i sent her this       i saying this as softly as I can       your not sorry ok       you did nothing wrong       im going to say it again       you did absolutely nothing wrong       its me Christa       i always pushed away its come from my experiences       its the way ive been brought up       I wont ask anyone for a dollar, i wont ask anyone for a ride its just the way i am       if i had to walk 3 miles out of my way to help you or anyone else out i would because that was never done for me          I truly appreciate the care you give and what you both did tonight       its just i never had that before i never had that caring       i didnt know how to react             if you want to know whats really going on with me right now i would tell you          i dont want anything in return as far as im concered i didnt do anything for you that you wouldnt do for me          i just want you to be yourself       thats it          i want you to laugh at my jokes when you think there funny i want you to smile when you want to smile       watching you or anyone else laugh because of something i did or said gives me more than you could imagine          Christa i know you still dont want to hear this       im the last person you ever need to worry about       i think its spectacular how you care after i say that       ill find my way through anything ill go over anybody       I would never hurt you.       i would never tell you to go away ever       im sorry for what happenend. Ill take responsiblity.       thank you Christa you gave me something i never had.       if you ever need me for anything im right here    ill always your shoulder to fall back on              i then got this from her          Hey Bill!!       Don't worry, we're fine. I'm not mad or anything even remotely close, just concerned. The only reason why I didn't reply back sooner was because my computer caught a nasty virus and I gave it to Will's mom's computer as well. That turned into an ordeal and my computer survived but Will's wasn't so lucky (if you haven't talked to him lately, that would probably be the reason why).       So yeah, sure, we can talk tomorrow. I'm in the cafeteria in the mornings, you can probably pull me aside then. But yeah, Will was really concerned as well, we both want you to be happy and stress-free. Last nigth when I was with Will until 11:00pm trying to get his computer running and while he was stressing over that, he was all like "I really hope Bill's okay". I agreed with him. We both care about you and we both are willing to help in any way that we can, promise. So don't be afraid to talk to Will either, he would probably also understand because he's a guy and all. But if you really want to talk to me alone, that's fine too. Well I have to check on my brownies now so that they don't burn, talk tomorrow then.       Feel better mon ami    Christa          so are me and her okay

20070514160413AAUSGnq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Riddle me this...is my friend a whore?	I don't know what’s wrong with her!  She has ALMOST slept with the same a guy twice, and the stuff that she has done with him is pretty bad--and gross.      She says she feels bad for doing that stuff and leading him on, because she has no feeling for him.        Earlier this year, a guy did the EXACT same thing to her.  Now she's doing it to his best friend.  I don't think she feels bad about it, even though she says she does...      She's started drinking and smoking--she’s says it's because of this situation, but I think it's been going on for a while.  I don’t know what to do with her.        I want to help her!

I ended up telling a guy I work with I had a   secret crush on him and I was all over him.      Apparently the feeling is not mutual and he was just being   nice to me.

20070624144148AAEFhOv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my supervisor hate me or have a crush?	I've been working at a factory for about 4 months now and the line supervisor seems to have some kind of problem with me and I don't know why. He is only a few years older than me (he's about 23 or 24) and he's only a supervisor because his mom is one of the big bosses. Anyway, I constantly catch him staring at me and he is always moving me away from people and putting me in an area that he knows I don't like. For example, I was working with a male friend and we were just talking and laughing and then the line supervisor pointed at me and told me that he wanted me to replace a woman who was hand packing, even though she was doing a good job at it and he told her to go back where I was. Anytime he sees me talking to guys he always moves me. There are plently of men and women at work that are all over each other and he does nothing. Also, his eyes get really big when he talks to me and he raises his eyebrows, he doesn't do that with anyone else. Does he have something against me or what?

I asked her to the zoo but the weather is going to be crappy this weekend so.....she is about 5'6" about 110lbs, blond hair blueish gray eyes, looks almost russian in the face, Beautiful lips, and a body like no other haha, she is very shy and doesn't talk a whole lot, she is very interested in photography, but she said she kind of got out of it after living in Brazil for a year. She is really involved with school right now, she's taking like 18 hours worth a week, and studies a lot as well. She is free on the weekends, and its supposed to rain all weekend, i just wondered what some good ideas are for a second date with this girl.... She likes to stay out late as well.  and on our first date we already went to an art gallery and out to eat and to movie and had bubble tea :) i'm just trying to think up somthing different :)
20070404053916AAKBwGJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what if you just meet someone at a bar?	and you go home with them, you have sex, and you don't see them every day, but your on "booty call"? Does this happen to a lot of people or is it just totally and completely wrong? I mean like i said, looking for FWB type relationship, i'm not looking for a relationship, i just need to feel somthing again. I have a need to spend some time with a girl before i leave forever. I'm moving to Texas From Ohio and i would let her know that in the very begining. I just like to have someone to go out with and hang out with, not all the time but a lot of the time.
20070402090040AA8CLA9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what about this girls?	I am moving to Texas, Say I told you this when i met you at the bar or off the internet or whatever. I'm fairly attractive, I'm kind of punky/ goth looking, i guess a bit feminine but a lot of girls are into that kind of thing now a days. So lets say we go out on a few more dates, start seeing a lot more of each other and fool around and just spend time by ourselves and we really start digging me and vise virsa. Knowing I'm moving away would you hang out still or not waste your time getting to know me knowing the inebitable will happen ( i know i asked a similer question earlier but i just would like to rephrase it i guess)
20070403052857AAuvnDV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	K where did all the cute girls go?	i love a girl with Tattoo's up and down her arms...

I mean there is nothing like this around the area i live in (columbus, Ohio) I wonder where they are!! I love cute Rockabilly/punky/ rocker chicks..... Where the HELL ARE THEY?!? lol
20070405130647AAOQknC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So im going to a metal show with a girl i just met, she know's im interested in her?	and i was wondering what are some good ways, i guess, to show her that i'm more interested in her I mean what could i do at the show we go to and stuff you know what i mean? I mean i really think i will like this girl a lot, i've never hung out with her, i've met her at work and we always have good conversations over a cigarette in the morning, I just have never been on i guess what you would call a date since i'm going with her, to a metal show... i mean usually i go with my drinking buddies and we get hammered and go party with the band afterwards LOL.
20070405070259AAzZJpf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Alright so i asked the girl, and this is what happend?

20070514170350AAPTocZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ex-BFF keeps calling me a wh*ore             .                                                               .	I simply ended our friendship because everyone saw, and eventually I figured she was using me, she caused over half of the drama in my life and she just caused me severe stress. She was upset, I ended it with a poem and a bracelet the nicest way I can, I wasn't near her when she read it because I knew she would crack and possibly throw something at my head. She started crying, and I said nothing about her imperfections but she was still pretty angry. I had two friends who JUST ended being her friend two to three days ago. Not for me, though. My ExBff new I was going to have this huge whole-grade party with everyone so she was being nice to me because she wanted to get invited, well I'm not having it anymore because my Dads studio got flooded and now he's selling it. After she found out, well I didn't know she was sitting out our table (me and my friends', before they stopped being her friend.) and so I sat in her seat because I thought she was absent. So I moved, she went to throw something away, and my friends slid her lunch down the table as a joke. I didn't even touch it, and she got mad so she moved to another table, so if she wasn't sitting there I just sat in her seat for the day because it was closer to my friends. She saw me, and assumed it was me who moved it and got soooo mad. At recess, after, we had this huge fight, she was shaking while she was talking and kept calling me a loser. Ever since, everytime she sees me she yells out "who*re" and it really agrivates me. I tried talking to her and my friends dragged me to guidance to talk it out, nothing worked. What do I do to show her how pathetic and low-life she is being? I'm sick of it and I'm trying to be nice but it's extremely hard! Help?

Hi, i'm 16 years old and i've had a really really big crush on a girl in the year below me at school for a pretty long time. I know that she might not like me in the same way, but I care a lot about her and I wanna give it a try. Now i'm thinking about sticking my neck out and telling her that I like her, but I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable or uneasy. Are there any ways that I can drop hints about the way I feel in one of our everyday conversations? If not, then is there a way that I can tell her without making it hard for her to respond? I wanna let her know that I actually care about her and that even if she doesn't feel the same way about me, I would still talk to her if she wanted to and be a good friend. Any advice and answers that you can give me are deeply appreciated, Thank-you in advance.

I have been seeing this guy for over 8 months now, and I realized that I have really strong feelings for him.  It started as something very casual and light, and he cares about me and he treats me well.  I am moving away for a job in August, and he and I both don't want to do long distance--so it is a relationship that will end sooner or later--should I make the best of it and make it last, or break up with him today? My heart tells me that I should make the best of it--because it would hurt me more to not be with him-- but my head tells me that I should break it off right now before I get too deep and can't get out without being hurt deeply.  Which should I follow, my head or my heart?  He suggested, after talking about it last night, that it may be best to see each other less.  What would that do to our relationship? If we take "time off " or "see each other less" I can only see myself wondering why I am in this relationship with him in the first place.  I am so miserable. Help.

20061218070133AAoziKl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How is this going to end?  Will it ever?	Recently got out of a FWB relationship at work with an older woman, divorced 3 kids, she was seeing a guy who was unavailable and just using her for sex (he lived with his girlfriend).  Basically she was sleeping with lots more guys, told me about it, I told unavailable guy and she cut off contact.      Now I have e-mailed her once or twice to apologise and ask if we can be friends, she has reported this as harrassment at work and that we never had sex.  Basically she is trying to make out I had a crush on her as I was younger and I got jealous.  Makes me angry she is denying the sex but we work in different departments.      But still I wonder how this is going to work out, I will not contact her obviously but if she is really mad she may just make stuff up or do other things.  She also has bipolar disorder.  My point is she has given me a stigma at work.  Now what?

20070604191335AAo5Odv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need some help here...?	K, so I met this guy at my friends cabin a few weeks ago. Since then we went twice... we really hit it off at the cabin and seemed to when we were out together... Although he never kissed me on the first date or the second. My schedual had been pretty crazy with travel and work the past 2 weeks, but I still managed to make time, although it wasnt alot. I called him last night when I had got back from the weekend, I had just gone out with him on thursday (the second date with no kiss) I told him to give me a call and we would do something this week. I was expecting him to call tonight, but havent heard from him... do you think he is even into me? Should I waste my time?? Also, if I dont hear from him tommorow, should I make an attempt to call him again or should I just forget it and move on. P.S. I really like this guy...       Any advice please!!
20070608113129AAkud4o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what do I do?	So I have been seeing this guy for 2 weeks now, a total of 3 dates. On the third date I went to his house and we watched a movie... we got to making out and lots of touching. I said I had to leave, we dont live close and I had to work in the morning. Plus I just didnt feel comfortable staying there yet, like I just met the guy, he has roommates, whatever. I could tell (obviously) he wanted to have sex. But really I wasn't ready for that, we finally just kissed that night. I would like to wait till the 4th or 5th date at least... When I left I told him to call me, he said he would.... Yeah that was Tuesday night, it is now Friday... I know he is going away this weekend... should I call him, or send him a text or wait for him to contact me?? I really like this guy, but I dont think I should have just slept with him cause I wanted to keep seeing him, right? I am kinda thinking if he really liked me it wouldnt matter to him that I didnt sleep with him, stay over, etc.....

I'm a Lesbian with 2 female lovers, the first one is an older woman who I happen to love dearly, we have been together for about a year now and she is wonderful, everything was going great between us then I met this younger girl who is stunning both physically and sexually,  she practically threw herself at me but she was impossible to resist.   At first I thought I could handle having them both even though it's something I never done before.   my problem is that I have found out that I cant handle both women at the same time, I do love my first girlfriend but the sex is so remarkable with this other girl that I am confused what to do, this other girl shows me a lot more attention than my main girlfriend, she even call more often and we end up spending more time together because my main girl is always so busy, yet to be having sex almost every day with two women who cant seem to be satisfied  is taking it's toll on me, I really do feel the need to walk away from one of them but who?

20070406131442AATyPvT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would U believe a rumor?	A woman needs to SEE her man fulfill his promises because seeing is always more powerful than hearing. Allow me to illustrate. Imagine someone told you that I was the meanest person they had ever met. For months all you heard was how terrible I treated my family and friends. Then one day you met me and during the course of our meeting you begin to notice that I didn't seem to be as horrible as you were led to believe. I actually appeared to be rather pleasant. Would you change your entire opinion about me from one visit? Probably not! However, if you saw me respond consistently with kindness and humility over a period of weeks, your opinion of me would begin to change. A paradox has just been established. The kindness you have seen in me for the last few weeks does not match what you have heard about me. All the rumors of how mean I am begin to fade into darkness because of my consistent actions. Over time what you see will replace most if not all of your concerns about my character.

20070419131946AAdcQNg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was your first boyfriend also your first date?	I'm frustrated because ive always dreamed of a special first relationship. That didnt happen. I had my first date 2 months ago with a guy i really liked. Then a month later he ended it. While we were together i told him i was not his gf. he asked y and i said because you never asked. He never did. So was he my bf? The most intimate we ever got was hugging and cuddling. My definition of a bf/gf is that the guy has to specifically ask the girl to be his gf and there has to be a kiss. He didnt ask me and we didnt kiss. So was he my first bf? i dont consider him my first bf, at least i dont' want to, but he went and told my friend i was his third gf. So then i went and made it clear to him that that's not my def of gf/bf. What do you guys think? Did the person you first dated become your first bf? if so, lucky you.

Volleyball has always been the thing that kept me in though. And my team down there was really really good.      And the other place is where Im currently living. I've made numerous amounts of new friends... But the ones i hangout with sort of make me mad ALOT! I play volleyball too but the team isnt to glamorous and I hate many people on the team because of the lack of dedication and abilty.      Which way should I turn to???

20070620222931AAWvBA6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you have to do to keep neighbors out?	Hey, I have these 2 really, really annoying neighbors: Corbin and Kyle. Corbin is 15, and Kyle is 8. Well, my son, Jeremy, keeps continually getting in fights with these two boys (attacking and arguing). I told Jeremy to tell them not to come in our yard, or pass through our yard to get to the other neighbor's yard for Jeremy's sake. Corbin told Jeremy that the only way to keep him out is to have a No Trespassing Sign. Soon, we are getting a new fence, and so Jeremy told Corbin this, but Corbin said he'll jump the fence. Is the crap coming out of this kid's mouth true? Can't I call the cops if I have a fence?

But Courtney and I were in the bathroom and we heard heavy footsteps and doors slamming, and girls screaming upstairs, where everyone else was. So then, my BFF Katie called and I answered my cell phone. It was like 2 in the morning. She's more of a party girl rather than a sentimental freak and she was bawling her eyes out on the other line. I couldn't hear anyone else in the back ground, but Courtney and I still heard girls screaming upstairs. Want 2 know what happened? Post what you think and I'll tell ya another day.

20070624184612AAeMLhq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The guy I like is wonderful to me but we R friends right now is that a sign that hes not interested in dating?	I have been seeing this guy for quite some time and we are great friends. We have had our share of differences. He spends an incredible amount of time with me. He compliments me, opens doors for me gives me massages does nice things for me, kisses me on my forehead and hugs me tight whenever I see him. We were on a path which seemed like something that could possible turn into a relationship. I asked him about it and he freaked out and told me he wasn't ready for a relationship. I just got upset and assumed that he did not want to go there with me and was just giving me an easy let down. He keeps saying things like he would want to pursue something with me possibly in the future....but I'm not sure if he is just softening the blow just because he only wants friendship and doesn't want to hurt my feelings. I know either way I should move on and accept his wonderful friendship but I wonder if he is just trying to "be nice" in saying i'm not interesting or could he possible not be ready?

He left for another state shortly after we met & invited me to go travelling with him. At the time I couldn't. He kept in touch by chat every few wks and we get on well. A couple of mths ago, he told me he had fallen for me& I have too but havn't told him as I'm scared its infatuation unless we spend time together. I did tell him I'm in his area in a couple of wks for work & I told him to make sure he doesnt have a girlfriend (flirting)! He said, hurry up and come here! I'm so scared. He's been in contact since & its friendly...how can I control the pace so I don't get hurt? He is very good looking, I wonder what he sees in me. I'm not a model but he could get so many girls!! Also he is so much younger than I am.
20070710113947AAIvglR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are the signs that a "shy boy" likes you or loves you?	Here are characteristics - is it "like" or "love"?      - you're different than all of his other girl friends - he really trusts, respects, and adores you   - gives you a consistent cute nickname   - friends can tell and say it's obvious - it's like he wants to ask her out, but it's like something's stopping him   - the way he looks at the girl (he'll stare at the girl but look away when she looks) and he'll look at her like she's the most beautiful girl   - he'll be playful and make fun of you, push you around   - will say that you're pretty but not in a straightforward matter   - calls the girl and is willing to stay on the phone with her late even if he's tired   - doesn't like all the guys that hit on her and think she deserves "the best"   - when he greets you, he'll give the girl a side hug with a little "nudge" with his head on the side'   - when he does have a chance to go out with this girl, he tells her that if they were to go out, it would be at the "right time" - something long lasting, real, and serious

20080926101354AA5cRS6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she make sense with this point? [ladies]?	My girlfriend has asked me to start taking a nap before we end up going out. There are days when this is impossible so when that happens she gets a little ticked off and thinks I am being moody because I didn't have a nap. She also takes naps and thinks that a quality nap before going out is a great way to start the evening together. Does this make sense? 
20080925141150AA9a4ie	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this seem like normal behavior [ladies]?	Each time I have plans to go out with my girlfriend, she claims I am often moody before going out and thinks I get way up tight from being that way all day long on my job. She believes that I need to start taking a nap and for her to pick out my clothes for our dates to "take pressure off of me". When I wear polo shirt she has to button it up. She likes to make my outfits color coordinated and that I look nice for our time out. She says once I have had a nap I am more at ease to.   She loves to layer my polo shirts with a crew neck cardigan and goes as far as to button up the outfit because I take too long getting ready. She dresses similar to this and I think it is ok but is normal for her to ask me to take a nap before a date and to button up my outfit because I take too long?

20080509094513AA8jkgQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SIgn Language Interpreting?	When I was 6, my cousin was born deaf. Her parents never took the time to master sign language and it always bothered me. From a very early age I took an avid interest in Sign Language and taught myslef the alphabet so thta I could atleast fingerspell to her. When I was about 17 years old I had gone to church on a Sunday night with all my friends and there was an ASL interpreter there who was interpreting the Worship Songs and the Service. I knew without a shadow of a doubt that this was my calling. Flash forward 9 years later and I finally went back to school and am about to finish my first year of ASL, I am doing really well and I just wonder if I should continue to pursue this or if anyone else has had a similar experience, knowing what their calling is?

20081009083457AAaq1xv	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my step sister such a selfish nasty b*tch?!?!?!?	I am 26 and my step sister is 34... in the past few years we have gotten "close" I guess. We have two entirely different personalities.  Over time I have slowly started to notice that she is a selfish and nasty person. She always makes negative comments and passes judgments on things... especially on things she's not familiar with.  She usually gets into confrontations when we are out at the mall or at a restaurant. She makes rude comments to people that stand to close to her in line or to people that she thinks are trying to skip her in line. She yells at waiters and waitress if they forget to bring something and then instead of giving a tip she writes them nasty notes on the receipt (i usually have to go back and put money on the table after she has already taken my tip money)       We both tried to lose weight and I managed to get down to a size 4 and she told me I must have an eating disorder.Ive gained some weight back now so Im bigger than her and I complimented her on keeping her weight off and she implied that I must be jealous of her?!       If I tell her Im doing something with friends she volunteers to come along (uninvited) and then makes comments about my friends      When my boyfriend and I first started dating (it had to have been a month at that time) I told her we hadnt had sex and we decided to wait until we knew each other a little longer and go together to get our tests done... so she starting saying that he was gay because every man wants to have sex!!! So now almost a year later she still makes jokes about him. My thing is why cant he have manners and respects me unlike her animal like husband who she always have to scream and fight with?!      She started and graduate college after me and demanded a designer hand bag as a graduation gift and when I told her no she got all upset and didnt speak to me for 2 weeks. all the while I graduated both grad and undergrad before her and got nothing nor did I ask for anything      Her birthday was last month and my other sister gave her an Itouch and she demanded that I buy her a matching case (to the bag she brought herself for graduation) all the while she gave me nothing for my birthday, come to think of it she didnt even call me. But now she texts me and calls me every damn day over this case?!?! And has the nerve to tell me that I'm selfish for not giving her a gift!! Ummm excuse me I thought a gift was a kind gesture not a requirement!!!

20071224170424AAql92v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Queria a opini?o de vcs...  Coisa de ex-sogras...?	Eu e o meu namo terminamos nosso namoro de 4 anos no fim de outubro deste ano. Por váaaarios motivos: acabou o amor, entrou na rotina, etc etc etc...  Um desses motivos é o fato dele ter ido viajar para outro país no come?o de setembro (e só volta em abril).      Bom, daí nunca mais nos falamos...  só que hoje (véspera de natal) os pais dele vieram aqui em casa me visitar e me trazer um presente de natal!  (e eles sabem q nós terminamos!).  Pra ficar mais estranho ainda, o presente nao me serviu e eles fizeram quest?o de ir comigo lá trocar ainda hoje!  E pra ficar mais estranho ainda, encontrei uma conhecida minha lá no shopping e ela se apresentou dizendo q eu sou a "nora" dela!      Daí fiquei meio confusa, achei tudo isso super estranho...  Vcs acham q eu n?o devia ter aceitado o presente? Ou q eu devia ter falado com ela q eu e o filho dela nao vamos mais voltar? Vcs tb acham esquisito essa atitude dela? Qual é a opiniao de vcs?

20071030134325AAxD3Jx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	O q vcs acham de um namorado q vai pra outro país por 6 meses e n?o querer mandar notícias pelo menos 1x por s	1 vez por semana?  Eu nunca fui pro exterior, ent?o n?o sei como é, todo mundo fala q é uma loucura, mó correria e tals...  Ent?o eu queria saber a opini?o de vcs.      Meu namo foi pra outro país por 6 meses. Agora fazem dois meses q ele partiu e como ele quase n?o manda notícias (nem pra mim nem pra mae dele) e reclamei pra ele e nao adiantou...  Aí eu falei q ou ele manda notícias (via e-mail ou via telefone) pelo menos uma vez por semana ou a gente termina! E sabe o q ele escolheu???  Terminar!!!         Disse q ele é assim mesmo, ele n?o é de mandar email nem de ficar ligando e q eu tinha q gostar dele do jeito q ele é!  Realmente, ele nao é de ficar mandando email ou telefonando (mesmo qdo ele tava aqui Brasil), mas acho q agora é diferente né po! S?o 6 meses lá do outro lado do mundo!        Pois é, ent?o terminamos o namoro de 4 anos. Vcs acham q eu fiz a coisa certa? Vcs acham q tem volta? Vcs acham q ele me ama?
20070916092516AAIxWMt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Meu namorado foi viajar e nao me dá noticias...  Será q ele quer me esquecer?	Nosso namoro nao estava tao legal...  nada sério, mas eu sentia uma certa frieza por parte dele...   Bom, aí ele foi viajar para outro país para estudar e ficar 6 meses por lá. Agora já faz 9 dias q ele foi e nao me ligou, nao me mandou mensagens, e-mails, nada. Nem pra mim nem pra mae dele, q as vezes me liga pra perguntar se ele me manda noticias.    A unica coisa q ele fez, foi entrar na internet 5 dias atras por 5 minutos (foram 5 minutos literalmente!) pra dizer q estava tudo bem e q estava tudo muito corrido e por isso ele nao mandava noticias (sequer um "eu te amo" ou "sinto sua falta" ele disse)...   Mas isso já faz 5 dias! Será q ele nao tem mesmo 15 minutos do dia pra escrever um e-mail ou ligar só pra dizer um oi...   O q é isso? é normal? é q eu nunca viajei pro exterior, talvez eu nao saiba mesmo como é...  Sei lá...
20070919080220AALEJBn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Meu namorado foi viajar e n?o me dá notícias. O q vc pensaria a respeito?	Eu já peguntei isso antes, mas antes fazia 1 semana q ele tinha ido e agora já fazem 2 semanas. E nada de e-mail, liga??o ou mensagem. Eu sei q ele está bem pq falei com a m?e dele. A m?e dele tb n?o recebe notícias dele, mas aí ela mesma liga pra lá!       Bom, eu já mandei 3 e-mails pra ele. Estou pensando em ligar pra lá, mas tenho quase certeza q se eu fizer isso vou brigar com ele pq eu realmente estou ficando p... da vida com essa falta de considera??o.        S?o 4 anos de namoro e ele está em outro país e vai ficar por lá por 6 meses. E ele tem acesso à internet, mas segunda mae dele, ele disse q nao tem tempo...  (nao tem 15 min pra escrever um "te amo" no email e me mandar???)      A pergunta é: Pq ele está agindo dessa maneira? No come?o achei q ele estivesse muito ocupado ou talvez ainda nao tivesse se adaptado...  mas agora já fazem 2 semanas, né po!
20070927182133AAaD8D3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Como vc percebe q é o momento certo de acabar com tudo?	Me refiro a terminar um namoro.

Oks, fiz várias perguntas..    resumindo, respondam essa: Se vcs já terminaram com um namorado ou namorada, o q exatamente levou vcs a fazerem isso?

20080302091442AA8dZLF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	I think my friend might like me, but I'm not sure. He always looks at me, makes eye contact and smiles. He teases me constantly and makes me laugh a lot. His face lights up when he sees me. He'll often offer to help me with things, even without me asking, and he offers to give me lifts home, telling other people when they offer to drive me that he's taking me. He notices little things about me, like when my hair's a bit different, and he remembers little things. He often talks about how well he knows me. He opens up to me and tells me things he doesn't tell anyone else. Do you think he likes me? How can I tell (without asking him)?

20080705183840AAE1jvf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Taken advantage of?...?	Last night I was at a party in my friend's house. I drank way too much, and got very studpidly drunk - to the point that  can't remember anything after a certain point!   So I passed out on the sofa, having been sick.      The next morning my friend told me that she walked in to the sitting room and had expected to see me sleeping but instead, one of the guys who was there was leaning over me with his penis out and tried to hide when she walked in!   I was still passed out!      He told her that it was "just a hand job". I have absolutely no recolection of this, and don't know how to react. I feel disgusted, and I'm never talking to him again. I texted him to let him know that he repulses me.      He is a dirtbag, he's with his girlfriedn for a year and a half and is constantly cheating on her!       I'm afraid that he may have stuck his penis in my mouth..   I'm only 16, he's 18...      Oh I dunno just, can somebody tell me what to do? Or say something to make me feel better? :(      Thank you x

20070713182336AAWe6n4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unsure if he likes me or not. PLEASE READ!?	I need some honest advice about this: I think my supervisor is interested in me but I could be wrong. Yes, I know I shouldn't date my supervisor but just overlook that fact and let me know if it seems like he likes me or is just doing this job. He's young, very attractive and fit so it's kinda hard for me not to notice him. Anyway, at first I thought he didn't like me because he kept staring at me and always moved me away from guys I talk to at work and he never did the same to the other girls. Now he is starting to actually talk to me and he asks me very obvious work related questions that are unnecessary. He smiles while talking to me and keeps constant eye contact (never looks away) and I've watched him talk to other people to see if he always smiles but he talks to them normal. I'm not being a stalker and I don't make it obvious when I look at him, I just glance around. But when I look in his direction 90% of the time he is already looking at me and then he quickly looks away.
20081001160018AAdEgcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get closer to him?	ok, so there's this guy that i like (call him kendrell) i admire him from afar. he's really handsome, and seems to be a gentleman. ive never heard or seen him do anything disrespectful. he talks to many of my aquaintances and has the same lunch period like me. i asked my friend if he has a gf and she said no. but she also told me that he's the type of person who will talk to a girl and like them but dont ask them out but thinks i should go for it cuz i could be the one to change that. she introduced us while we were standing in a group, but that's as much talking as i did to him (all i said was hey). how do i get closer to him? id be satisfied even if we were to remain freidns and not get to bf gf. just how do i get there??
20070818171309AAKoB6F	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why doesn't she just come out and say it? Please read.?	She won't say your too young, she said I'm a kid still.   It's a girl who will be 15 in October, and I'll be 14 in April. She will not be going to the same High school as me. She used to like me , now she says I'm just too young, and believe me she told me in a very subtle way, very. I want her, no one else to have her. She likes older guys, all they want to do is "Shizzle her Wizzle" in bed. That's why I want her and I like her!      So what shall I do about this, have not called her in about 4 or 5 months, I talk to her on myspace but, I hate that. I predict that she will come back to me after she realizes what a 16 yr old boy wants, but I don't want to lose her because of my pride.

No one was there except this one dude closing the gym. We got out to my car only to discover the tires had been slashed. The dude ran out of gym, saying he had just closed the gym and that he could give us a lift. We were all suspicious of this dude so we passed.  He got kinda mad and started freaking us out, so we got in my car and locked the doors. We called my aunt, and she came to get us. We never go to the gym anymore!!

20081024093031AA3mhOL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was my ex-boyfriend right or wrong for what he did?	I had a boyfriend who was always known for being a wishy washy person and doesnt do anything he says he's gonna do. He claims that he is saved and accepted christ and I was very happy from him. A few days ago, he told me that he was definitely gonna come back home( he's been in Jackson,MS for over a year, so it was a long distance relationship), and that we was gonna get married at the justice peace, find ourselves a place, and told his mom great things about me,etc..   I even sent him money to pay back someone before he gets himself in trouble so he can come back. I accepted him back b/c I thought he has changed so much and things were going to get better for us, simply b/c I have went through hell with him and suffered emotional and verbal abuse for him. All of the sudden, he calls me and tells me that God told him that we cant be together no more b/c he wants to do whats right and he's still married and so on. He had me thinking all this time that he was already divorced. He tells me now that there is more to the divorce and his wife dont wanna sign nothin, so thats why he decided to end it. The problem is that he led me on and told me all these good things about us and he was already a christian and then he tells me the total opposite a few days later. He has did this a few times to me, and was still messing around with me. Should I get upset b/c he led me on and got my hopes all up, or should I just get over it and not deal with him anymore? Does that means he's being a hypocrit? Is this all game if he did this before?? I'm asking if it is b/c this is my first time having my heartbroken and I'm naive when it comes to men. im still hurt about it!
20070712211049AAkHpA1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do i feel like this?	I know this is stupid and all but my friend that was my past college teacher that I look up to as a mother figure in a way had a baby yesterday. Well the thing is... we only talk through email and its not like she emailed me ALLLLL the time but like every couple of weeks or so. Well now that she has a baby.... I feel like our friendship might drift away or something b/c she might not be able to email that much anymore. And I cant call her b/c I dont know her number and she hasn't given it to me either. I want to ask her if I can see the baby but dont know how she will respond. Im afraid she will be thinking something like... she thinks she can come over and see the baby?? And it makes me feel depressed b/c I dont want to lose her friendship either. I want to send her a meal cert. thingy but I dont know her address although its listed in the phonebook. I just dont know what to do. I am female and I have good intentions!

20070625153025AARCJsB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, do you find that withholding sex from your man is a good motivator?	If you feel like your man (or husband) is not appreciative, do you withold sex to get him to do what you want? For instance, he stopped taking out the garbage, or you stopped going places, or you're having an argument and want to change his "opinion."      Is witholding sex a good idea? since men are more sexually driven and no sex from you means they may get it from someone else (ie cheating).
20081023111936AA65Vfa	Family & Relationships;Weddings	As A Bride would you like a store that had it all?	Ok, So do you like shopping around or this idea?      A Bridal Mall or sorts, Different departments.   Shoes,dresses[top5designers],jewelry, a lady to do alterations, a place to work out with other brides to fit your dream dress, a small cafe, bridesmaids dresses to rent OR buy, and  consignment  to resale the dresses after you're done with them and decide to sell, IT could be in a shop with brides coming in all the time, and they could choose to buy a preowned...and yours would be there for their liking and selection?      A place where you wouldn't be judged, and there would always be a lady there to help you with invitations, ceremony accessories, and an area where you can look up all vendors, photographers, and caterers, and a 50 mile radius?      Would you like that as apposed to going from store to store to store and STILL nto finding what you want?

20070901125322AA5dNlF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this sound like a guy in LOVE?	A guy.. 26 and is still a virgin. slightly overweight but great personality. a bit stubborn but overall a nice guy. He is dating a 20 yr old girl.. also a virgin. She's saving herself for marriage however he is not. They've been dating 8 months. He has been trying to compromise little by little since month 1. At first its just undressing.. then oral.. then all the way.. U know how things go. Anyway its been 8 months and they're both still virgins.. not for lack of trying on his part.   Also he used to call and text ALL the time. now its only occasionally but not as often. used to hang out all the time.. now maybe once every week or so (crazy schedules ya know?).. but still he cares if she calls he makes her call when she gets home etc..      QUESTION IS.. Do you think this guy LOVES this girl..   OR is he just trying to get in her pants.   Do you think he'll stay with her if he gets sex from her, or no?

20070706190856AAtKKRL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please, i really need your help....?	please help me... i think my head's gonna explode... here goes... I'm 16 years old, and I'm really in love with this girl who is the same year as I am. Now, you may say that it was love at first sight, but please read on first. Before this girl came into my life, I was really down in the dumps - my grades went haywire, I was addicted to computer gaming, and worse, I was really hooked into pornography. When she came, she changed everything. I managed to pull off a Houdini-type escape act with me surviving Physics in my 3rd year, I denounced computer gaming forever (and I am now trying to convince my friends to do the same..), and more importantly, I have managed to avoid all kinds of internet porn and all that kind of stuff for 6 months, starting with the date in which we first got to talk to each other (thru texting... :D). Now, I really want to tell her how special she is to me, but my head is telling me to postpone until the end of classes. I feel like for everyday that passes,

Hi my husband seems to be loaded with low self esteem and well he always thinks i want to be with the guys at work and not with him. I wouldn't ever be with other guys. All I do is talk to people.

I don't know why, or how...but she's different. She's pretty popular, and I'm not that popular. Mostly I am afraid of rejection, but I am also pretty shy around people I don't know. Please don't answer and say "just tell her", because I've tried, and it's not as easy as it is in writing. So....what should I do?

20070707014807AAYffrI	Family & Relationships;Family	What are the responsiblities of a sister?	I am an older sis (15) and I have three younger siblings - 2 sisters, 1 brother. I'm quite confused as to what are my responsibilities. When my younger siblings quarrel I always try to mediate. And I sometimes- okay maybe quite alotta times- scold them. Am I going too over the line? Where is the line between a mother and a sister anyway? Am I behaving like a mother?       Must all elder siblings be a good example or a role model to their younger siblings? I just can't seem to, especially in studies. I don't mind my younger sis scoring better and all that (I'm proud of her for that), but its the homework. I don't always do my homework- sometimes because of procastination ending up in a huge workload or sometimes because of a happy-go-lucky attitude. It's quite difficult to complete everything, you know. I sometimes fret that my siblings might become influenced by me. What should I do?

20070829075416AAtnx9i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Isn't this just a little childish?	Ok, so I've been hanging out with my friends and family a lot.  My cousin owns a barbershop & they've been having a lot of functions that she invites me to.  There's this guy there that I'm very attracted to but he has a girlfriend.  I'm sure he can tell I'm a little attracted to him, but I maintain my composure because of his situation.  However, everyone else is real friendly towards me and interested in gettin' to know me, but he seems to try to avoid having any contact with me what so ever.  My cousin said it's probably because he likes you and doesn't want to be tempted right now.        I'm 30 & he's 26, I just thought that was a childish way of handling it.  I mean even though we're attracted to one another doesn't mean that we still can't be cool and be friendly in a group setting, right?  Or do you think it may be a different reason y he avoids me?  I respect his situation, but wouldn't mind being his friend.

20081005135543AAL1wwp	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about my housemates bad behaviour? Any ideas anyone?	The guy is a nightmare to live with, really rude and ignorant and difficult to get on with, suffice to say I was pleased to hear he is moving out shortly.    Basically, I had a go at him because he decided to put the heating on timed, full blast mind without telling anyone else in the house and as we all share the bill I thought this was out of order. Since then he has been really weird and I noticed that my bike which is in the kitchen has been vandalised. I ha-vent taken it out for over a month and the last time i took it out it was fine, but now somebody has got a sharp knife and cut the seat so its unusable.   Its a brand new bike and I'm thinking it was him, my other housemate is my best friend and would never do anything like that, i always thought he was odd.   Im really upset about this but confronting him will do no good as he doesn't talk to me anyway and will only deny it.   What can I do because he shouldn't get away with that.   Any ideas????

I know everybody is going to tell me to move on but I dont want to I love that man even though he is living with another woman.  He ended up leaving me for her but swears up and down he didnt.

We would fight over stupid stuff like money.  Anyways, over time we started to grow apart and he became an a** and I became a b****.  But I still love him very much and want to fix things.

20070629202053AAQ1q1q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should your first relationship be serious?	I met this guy who I really like alot and he likes me too.And he asked me out and I said no. The only reason why I said that is because I've never had a boyfriend before and he would've been my first.      It's just that he is sort of a player. He's in my grade and he's dated 40 something different girls. And his longest relationship was only 2 months. I know only 2 of his girlfriends and I admit they're both very pretty.      But I'm not sure that he wants a serious relationship. I think he wants a fun one.       He's also veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy cute! He has green eyes and brown hair. There's really nothing ugly about him!       I really can't believe he even likes someone like me.   I think he can do better though. I also said no because he asked me out near the end of the school year and there wasn't really any point going out with him if I wasn't going to see him for 3 months.      Please help, I need some advice. Should my first relationship be serious or fun?

20070702222554AAX9t9J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	@korean girls born and raised in EU/US: Would your family mind if you fall in love with a "white" guy?	Hello out there,      I'm having a question to girls that have korean parents but were born and raised in Europe, USA or Australia.      I have a colleague who is born and raised in Germany. Till that point it didnt make a difference for me since she acts and behaves like other "german" girls. To be honest I didnt realize that there might be any cultural differences.      And she's very cute, hugging and dancing with me all the time and showing interest and I was thus thinking of going out with her.      But now I read in the Internet that Korean families are sometimes very strict regarding the relationships of their daughters. What is your experience? Actually, I was somehow very surprised and I wasnt thinking about such problems till now. But since we are both 28, it might turn out as a problem in the long term. My family actually wouldnt bother. Maybe my mom would be a little sad not having blond grandchildren but she's also openminded. :-)      No flames please & thanks

Ademas tengo miedo si no funciona las cosas entre nosotros que pasara despues, seria mucho riesgo. El dice k es muy enserio y k seria capaz de enfrentar todo. Si el me demostrara que si me quiere, yo si me arriesgaria. Pero tengo miedo y no se que hacer, lo quiero mucho.

20070729213114AAzL5DD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I overreacting?	So this guy and I went to HS together. Within the last year we became friends again (due to a mutual). I'm now living in the area he's in and he's commented many a time that he's interested in me for some time now to multiple people, myself included. So we did dinner a week or so ago, he picked me up, paid. We had a great time. He didn't make a move to kiss me though which I thought was weird or maybe he was just afraid? He called me that night and the next morning saying he had a great time and we should do it again later that week. Due to scheduling, we're now at 2 weeks and he suggested dinner after I got off work. He text me that day saying he forget when I got off, and ended up going back home (45 min away). So ended the night. I was pissed b/c I felt stood up and pointed that out to him. He apologized saying it wasn't his intent and it was his error and he wanted to make it up to me this week. I haven't bothered to respond. Do I give him another shot or move on to the next?

20070807212030AAutaUX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when the guy I've been seeing said he's "too busy" to have a serious relationship right now?	He and I have been seeing one another casually for a few months and I really like him. We work together, and he is also going to grad school at night on top of a full time job, so he IS busy, but so is everyone. I thought things have been going well, but then I brought up the "where is this going"  subject and that's when he dropped the "I don't want you to feel ignored, I am just so busy with everything going on...I would understand if you wanted to call it quits.  I just don't want you to be unhappy."  I feel like he's feeding me a bunch of BS and trying to back me into a corner to end the relationship so he doesn't have to.  Of course he swears he's not doing that, he just "wants me to be happy."  What do you guys think?

20070811080127AAt9pa6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in love!?	I'm in love with a girl that, for privacy reasons i'm calling bands. I love her. Please stop now if you are going to be stupid or stop later. I am only 12 and she is 11. I know we are just kids but I have thought it through and have told myself that age shouldn't stop love. You can be in love at any age, right? Bands and I were in a few little plays together. In my favorite of them was a play of the frog prince classic brothers grim tale. She played the princess and I the frog and prince. When the director decided to double the roles I got mad because I was seperated from bands more often. She lives about 30 miniutes from me but I don't know where she lives. I talk to her allot but only through email. She's the kindest, most proper, and smartest girl I know. She is home-schooled and I go to public school. I seriously love her. For further proof just ask. I haven't told her that I love her but did tell her that I liked her. What do I do? I love her but... Help me please. Thank you.

20070814081822AAsphzw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to help out a friend that...?	My friend just recently opened up and told me a secret he has been holding onto since he was 13.  He dates girls but he flirts/lead others on and even make the other ones believe they are in a relationship because he is not satisfied fully with the personality of one, and he said he "picks and chooses" the personality he likes within couple of girls even if it means being with selected girls on the side. If it didn't make sense, I mean, If his gf is missing a personality, he finds another one on the side to fill that in. He finally fell in love with a woman but he never told her that he had one on the side also because of his bad habit. He wants to make it right and change, and he asked me to help him, but I have no idea how to help him with that. I told him to tell her the truth and be honest with her. Do you think when she finds out, that he deserves the chance if he's willing to change? And is there a name for the type of person he is? He's not a bad guy, made bad choices though

I know this single guy in his late 40s who lives in a luxury apartment in Hollywood.  It makes me curious as to why he chose Hollywood, maybe because he loves the single life and wants to live out his playboy fantasies?  However, he does work in a city that is close to his work, 10-15 minutes locally, and he does need celeb clientele in his line of work....so guys, what kind of draw would it be to live in Hollywood: practicality/convenience or the lifestyle?

Ok, so I have met a few guys recently all in different places, I met one through a friend, another at a club and another in a cafe. All of whom seemed really nice. We went on a date or two, they told me their life stories and then one told me that he had a girlfriend and wanted to be "just friends", another said he had just broken up with his gfriend and wanted to be "friends for now" and the last one, freaked out and said it was too soon for him.   I txt them when they txt me, I listen to them when they call, and flirt back when they flirt with me. I haven't chased any of them, I have been sitting back and being very calm, cool and collected about them.   But yet, they all want to be "just friends", am i letting off some type of boy vibe?

20071021223243AASluAI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is three company?	OK, so my Wife has suggested we bring another man into the bedroom. First of all I was shocked. But trying to be open-minded. Have agreed to think about it. This has been almost a year. Last weekend a co worker of mine came over for a few drinks, ok we all were drunk. Anyway. He’s a friend of mine and a past friend of hers. Who she liked allot and they almost got together. Anyway, before I new what was happening, she was trying to make a move on him. And asking me for approval. Well he rejected her. And I am grateful. And it has not strained our friendship at all, but now my wife dreams about threesomes with him. And rejects me? How do I bring it to her attention? And why would she want to add someone to our bedroom. But tell me that it’s just sex? And that she loves me, but also she knows I am not comfortable with it? I love my wife. But there are times I don’t think that she has the same feeling for me. Or that she doesn’t find me attractive. What am I supposed to do?

20080102151155AAvWW0u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Some Girl Help?	I am 15 and a pretty shy guy when it comes to girls. Here is my question. Let's say I am out in public somewhere and I see a girl that I like and would like to hang out with sometime. How would I go about this? I know everyone says get to know her but I need something to say, like a plan so I don't just look like an idiot or a stalker or whatever else. So should I just go up and say hi I am so and so? I mean I can see this being alright for an adult but for someone my age? I just need something to say to keep a girl's interest. From there I guess I could handle just a normal conversation. Also the ending would be a problem. I heard that it is good to say that your friends are waiting or make it seem like you are in a rush. Is this true? Thanks for any help.

20080213004315AAy9Rqq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question for the ladies, Will my friend change her mind?	I have a friend (one of my closest) who is a girl (we are 19) and she is about 5'5 150-155lbs. She is not quite as physically attractive as me, but probably thinks she is. I am 5'8 and 175lbs, and she always talks about how height is important to her ina  guy, and sort of wants to get with a friend of mine who is a wuss, but is 6'2 and 220lbs of fat. I am like solid muscle, and she knows im the strongest of my group of friends, but insists (not that i asked her) that a tall guy makes her feel feminine. I dont understand this. If i can protect her better, where does this logic come from? And from your general experience, do girls like this change thier mind?

20080219161810AA0eFeH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sleeping with my friend...a mistake?	I've known this guy for a little over a year, and I love him dearly as a friend. The other night, we were hanging out, and he kissed me. It took me by surprise. We were debating on whether or not we should sleep together, and we discussed it for a long time. We thought about how it would affect other people in our group, and whether or not it would be a problem if we decided to sleep with someone else in the future. At the time, I thought about it, and said, "I don't care what you do...so what the ****? why not?" He said it was totally up to me and was really cool about it either way. We ended up sleeping together. Now I'm rethinking the situation, and I think I might have feelings for him.       Thoughts? Opinions? Advice? What would you do if you were me?

Here's a couple things that cause me to think that he might not like me:   *I sent him an email asking for a few questions like where his church is, what times are services, etc. and i also asked him for his phone number. He gave me every bit of info except for his phone number.   *Sometimes he seems to be more interested in playing his guitar or talking to his friends than talking to me.    *Sometimes he ignores me when I say hi.       Also, he's never been in a relationship before. And he's shy. I'm thinking he doesn't know what to do. Should I tell him I like him and see what happens? I'm nervous.

20080318221655AAemy0y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong for a young woman to be attracted to older men?	I am an 18 year old girl who is attracted to older men. When I say older, I mean like 25+ years older. I understand that the relationship probably won't go anywhere (I mean, he's married) but it doesn't bother me because I am sexually attracted to him. I feel like people my own age are just interested in sex, so why not be with a man I am attracted to and who is passionate about things, even if it's only for sex? I know it's probably unusual, but it's just how I feel. But does that mean that this man is a creep becuase he's interested? I don't think he realized how young I was when we started talking, so I don't think he's like, a pedophile, but he knew I was younger than him, obviously. Is that weird for a forty-something to be attracted to an eighteen year old? Is it wrong? Is something wrong with me? Any opinions would be appreciated!!

At one of our gigs he asked me to go to a concert with him. We have been together since. To me he seems like the kinda guy that would be a player and cheat on me or break up with me soon, but only because so many girls like him. I guess I can't see him staying with one girl for too long! He has all these friends that are girls and he lives in a different town. When we were at that concert he sang to me and held me. He tells me he loves me, and we have so much in common.

20080523135404AAe4PLT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex-gf who I'm still SOOO in love with is dating one of my bestfriends. HELP!?	my ex and I have been off and on for about two years. Our last official relationship was about 9 months ago. I know it's pathetic that I'm still so crazy and she wants nothing to do with me, but I just can't help it. I've tried everything to get over her, dating other girls, taking away all the stuff that she'd given me or reminded me of her, even therapy. Nothing works. And now to make things worse, one of my best friends and one of the few people that actually knows how I feel about this girl, is dating her. I was sitting in the hallway and they walked by holding hands. I was crushed to say the very least and I just can't handle it anymore. I love her so much and I feel like my life is just passing me by. I'll be honest, I have had thoughts of suicide in the past and I just don't want that again. Any advice from someone that may have gone through a similiar situation would be greatly appreciated.

20080705121708AAq8CVt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Survey, Men only.. about verbally abusive guys.?	u know I think some men or a lot of men think that they have to be jerk to women to get them to like them back or to have sex with women by making her feel emotional. so they would say things that are not nice, to get some women to like them.   isnt that true? whether its a false misconception or fact, they do it regardless.    and there are very very insecure often unattractive men who would do that to attractive women or vice versa..because they believe that by verbally attacking or abusing a person, they feel superior and they feel less insecure about themselves.   they almost do it out of instinct.    but I guess my question is..verbal abuse is an abuse. its sorta like a crime that should not be allowded or tolerated.   so do men realize thier problems while they are verbally attacking someone?   or are these men usually very ego-driven self-confident guy who feel like they are the top of the world?

20081009082925AAyQ5YJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband no longer is in love with me but does not want to leave.?	We have been married for 13 years. Have three children together. He cheated on me several times at the very beginning of our relationship but for many years he did not and things were wonderful. About 2 years ago, I caught him with one of our friends(and his coworker). In the conversation that followed that debacle, he said that he loved me but was not "in love" with me. But he wanted to stay and work on things. For the most part things were great. Our only two obstacles were that I was not able to get past his infidelity this time and he did not seem to want to give any affection at all. That just stopped the night I caught them. It just seemed to hurt more because she was my friend. And it did not help that she was always still around and still calling him, up to this day. I blew up on him two weeks ago because I found out they were playing poker online together. He said he did not tell me because he knew I would blow up. Told him I probably would not have if he had been honest. He swears that they are just friends. And honestly, when he is not at work he is at home, so I really don't think they are at it again. Since I blew up, I have tried to back off and not drive myself crazy. I am just makiing myself sick and that is not good for my kids. Yesterday, I decided to write a letter to him explaining my feelings and my thoughts on love and "in love" and ask that he try to show at least a small token of affection every once in a while. THAT did not go over well. He accused me of using the kids to try and make him feel bad because I said in the letter that I felt like the kids could see me hurting. This letter was JUST my feelings. I just wanted him to maybe see things from a different perspective. I said maybe he really is still in love with me but he is not working on seeing if that is possible. He flat refused to do anything. Said he should not have to try because he did not want to, He said he knew it would not kill him to give me hugs or tokens of affection, he simply DID NOT WANT TO so he is not going to do it. He said that we are good partners so he is not going to leave but I need to accept him for what he is. Said we got married for better or worse, I need to accept the worse. I am so hurt, lonely and sad right now. What do I do? Should I tell him to go since he is not even willing to do anything? Should I concentrate on myself and hope that he will come around? Any suggestions would be appreciated.
20081010204723AAPKLzQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does my husband really think I'm hot?	Ok my hubby (22 yrs old) used to date not so good lookin chicks before we met. But once we got together all he would talk about was how I exceeded his expectations. we just got married in July, and it seems like now he wants me to get in better shape. He never says it, but when I mention that my abs aren't as toned as they used to be, he just ignores it but before he would tell me I looked great. And the thing is, I haven't even gained weight since before the wedding. Does someone know what he might be thinking? He rarely ever complements me anymore. I mean if he says I'm so great compare to his exes, then why doesn't he act like it anymore?

He'd insult me, kept saying i was a bad person, puposefully make me mad and jealous by saying and doing things he used to do with me, with our other girl buddy..The worst part is he acted like he genuinely didn't care, and he actually even tried to have sex with me saying that i "owed it to him.."i regret it so much, but it's making me wonder if he ever really cared for me at all if he's reacting like this..or is it that i hurt him so much that he's covering it up by acting all mean?? he used to say he loved me so much its crazy, that he'd do anything for me...i hate this so much..or should i just completely drop it, and move on? i'm so confused and the way he was towards me hurt so, so much..

Then he smiles at that and then it's awkward, SO yea. I'm not sure if he likes me or not cuz we've been friends for so long...hm-mm    oh btw, he tends to be friends with a lot of girls but he's known me for the longest..

20081021085335AAt8ayq	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How can I have the wedding that I've always dreamed of without disrespecting my spouses family?	Well when they say opposites attract did they ever get that one right when it comes to me and my fiance...No not really. Our family's are just total opposites. My side tends to drink a lot and loves to have fun. They are loud and full of laughter and jokes all the time. His side is very religious, reserved and does not believe in drinking at all.  It is a ultimate sin. I'm finding it very difficult to plan my wedding because my spouse says we can't have a reception. If we have anything no drinking will be allowed because of his families beliefs. I on the other hand want to celebrate with a toast, a nice glass of wine or champagne. I don't want to disrespect anyone but if I don't have a reception/dance with drinks my family is going to be outraged. If we do his family will be. It is suppose to be our big day. I've thought about having a large wedding and quick dinner afterwords and just heading off to the honeymoon. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I said I was sorry and that I'd work on it, to which he replied that I always say that. This time I really DO want to work on it!      I dunno why, my man is a lover of very few words, the "strong silent type" when he says them he means them with all his heart, but he rarely says them. It's hard for me sometimes, because words are HUGE to me, SO I say them too much and he has been working on saying them a little more for me.      I notice when I don't say sweet things very often, he says them MORE often, so how do I work on this?

20081104124403AAqgRak	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls - Would you date a guy who is only 5'4?	Im 17 and feel I have trouble getting with a girl I like because I am short. The last girl I asked out was shorter than me but told me she "didn't have that protective feeling" round me. =( But I am a nice person and I KNOW I could protect her.      I have only asked girls out who are my height or shorter and it seems that even girls who are 5'2 want someone who is 5'8+ and it makes me sad.

There's this guy that I like and he likes me and we are practically going out.  We do everything we together...almost.  He already asked me out and I said "I don't have time for a boyfriend".  After that we still did everything together.  We went to free skates and we talked on the phone and he always waited for me after school with me for my sister.  A month later he asked me out again.  I said yes.  It just felt wrong together and I dumped him the next day.  To this day we still do stuff together for example tonight he asked me to go to the skate with him tonight but I couldn't because I was babysitting.  Our next dance is Thursday in 6 days.  My friend talks to him a lot and they talk a lot about me and him liking me, he wishes that I wasn't as "green" but he's going to ask me out again at our next dance.  I like him alot I really do and I don't know what to do.  What should I do?  I like him alot should I go out with him after the dance?  My friend says to just dance with him and my other friend says to go for it.  How to not be as "green" and yet still feel comfortable around him.  Should I go out with him?     HELP ! ?

I am very attracted to her and she is to me as well but the thing is I am 6"4 and she is 5"10 and people in the public and our friends constantly make fun of us (its mostly coz of me coz she isnt THAT tall really) and say we make a freakshow couple and call us the two towers and stupid nicknames and stare at us. She has always been insecure about her height and our friend told me a secret that my gf is planning on breaking up with me coz she would rather be with a guy that is 5"8 to 6"0 and that if she was shorter like 5"5 she would stay with me.

20081106161232AAxbcJG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I still want to be with him, but i don't want to get hurt again?	There's this guy i really liked and he said he liked me too, then we got into this huge fight. i texted him about 2 weeks ago, and we started talking again and he had said he had wanted to talk to me, but didn't think i would talk to him. he once brought up how he had said he liked me, but wouldn't say anything more about it. tuesday, he texted me saying "guess who i like" and i was hoping he would say me, but it turns out that he likes my friend that he already went out with once and he broke her heart. i told her, and she couldn't believe him. she said it was so low of him to do that to me, and she hasn't talked to him since. i feel horrible about the fight we got into tuesday, and i really want to say sorry and be sorta kinda friends again. (as in talking occasionally and joking around in gym again). i still want to be with him, but i'm afraid that if he did start liking me again, that he would hurt me for the third time. i really don't know what to do, i've told everyone i'm over him now, but i'm not, and everytime he walks by me in the hallway i can just feel my heart break...today i almost cried when i saw him. in gym, we were both about to walk out at the same time, and we both stopped, trying to avoid each other, and i don't want it to be like that. i would love to be friends or even boyfriend and girlfriend, but i'm really afraid. what should i do? should i say sorry, and i really would mean it if i did, and then just act like everything is okay and just play basketball with him sometimes in gym like we did before? i don't know what to do....
20081107154721AAn09u5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know if people are staring because you're attractive or ugly?	I catch a lot of people staring at me when I'm not looking.      I'm a 18 year old straight male      People usually look away when they're caught. People usually catch my eyes when they're staring ahead.      Some girls will smile.
20081117211147AAjkdpW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Since when is personality more important than looks!?	I mean, yeah..of course it would be nice if he was TOTALLY hot, AND not another jerk,....but that's usually hard to find!    I guess its important on how a guy treats you, but would you rather him be all nice to you and stuff, but be embarrassed of taking him out, because he looks so awful!? lol.   I'm not saying that LOOKS are more important, (because a really hot guy can be an ***-hole!)..      well, kinda hard to explain, but give me your opinions anyway!    (oh and don't be mean!)       Thanks, everyone!

My boyfriend and i have a very open minded sexual relationship. we talk about what turns us on and off. we always try new things and explore in great detail what we like. we watch porn together, all kinds. and we share our fantasies. I have no problem with him watching porn and checking other girls out. and i have no problem that he fantasizes about other women. However he has been telling me lately that he likes younger women, by younger women he means young girls, the younger looking the better. is this a normal fantasy for men to have?

20081118001923AAGS8KH	Family & Relationships;Family	Do mothers clean when they are angry?	Ok, i feel like an idiot already for even asking this, so please dont laugh, its just a kinda weird coincidence observation type thing i've noticed.       Well, when my mum gets really pissed at us (as in shouting and stomping around the place) she generally starts to clean the house after shes stoped screaming at us. Its random, like shes putting all her anger into getting stuff clean. Then i thought maybe all mums did this so then i thought to my other friedns and i noticed that all my friends who mums are really happy and have really happy familys have kinda cluttery, dirty houses, then the 1s that ive noticed to get angry have quite clean houses.      Sounds stupid, huh? But its kinda creepy   Do you notice this too or am i going crazy?

He's told me that he has feelings for me but we need to give it some time- that was a few months ago now. Do you guys think I should ask him to go with me to a basketball game?    
20081028210106AABuWkl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i just give up and change?	i don't know what to do, i'm that nice guy at school. girls say they want the nice guy but they go out with the jerk. i'm not shy, i'm outgoing, so its not like i'm not trying.    i'm chivalrous, so do girls not like that or does me being nice just make them check me off their list?  should i stop being the nice guy? because to me seems like girls don't care about that regardless of what they say.   i guess my main question is: is the way i act unwanted by girls?      P.S. do you think that nice guys finish last?

20081103105920AA8YTjJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am wrong for wating more out of my husband?	Nov. 1st was my eleventh wedding anniversary, I had asked my husband for a 24hr getaway from the kids and everything because it has been a long time since we had time for ourselves. He didn't make any plans, just thought we get in car and go. Which would be fine but he didn't set-up a babysitter for the kids. So we didn't go anywhere but I had asked my mom if she would watch the kids after she got off work so my husband and could go to dinner. She agreed, she was over at our house at 5:30 but he started working on model air planes with kids because he didn't want them to wait till sunday to do it. Well guess what we didn't do anything that night or the next; I didn't even get a card. I got upset and told him I was disappointed in him. He says that I am being irrational and I am the one who ruined the day. This is pretty much how every anniversary goes. Do I have a right to demand more?

20081105194957AA1kVrX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Your typical does he like me question.. but read.. I need advice :(?	Before I start, let me clarify, its not hormones, I'm not a teenager and this is not an extra marital affair..   So.. how would I tell you what's making me go head over heels? This is your typical, 'does he like me question', but seriously, I need advice or at least opinions.    I met this guy in Feb through a recruiter program dinner in a different state. We had quite a lot of laughs and at the end all we shared was a long long stare.. u know the kind that makes u tingle all the way through. yes we had drunk quite a lot, so it could have been that. Anyhow, after the night was over, we exchanged numbers, bid good night and I got on my flight back. I only texted him a few times after that. Then I moved here in August. No, it wasn't cuz of him.( I barely knew him, all I had was the look to hold on too) Anyway, I had sorta forgotten about him, till I saw him outside my office. Standing with his back to me.... my heart did a couple of leaps.. I couldn't get my self to talk to him.. ( what if he barely remembered me? worse what if he gave me a blank look..) so I face book befriended him instead. Original right! Anyhow, sure he remembered me. He invited me over to his house for a party.. then a second invitation. Each time I go there.. my heart.. its a different story. she does quadruples like you wouldn't know it. I know this description has gotten long, but bear with me.  How do I figure out if this person likes me? How do I know if the fleeting moment we shared in Feb is also what is on his mind. I think he has a gf. THINK>> not positive.>> but I can't get myself to ask him these questions. I'm new to this place.. he's been a pal.. i don't wanna loose that.. but .. really how do I know what he's thinking?   PS: did I mention that I can't stop thinking about him? I think that I see him almost everywhere I go....ahh nuts!

20081119004428AAL1ubI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this circumstance?	Here's the deal. I recently got in contact with a guy a dated a while ago. Unfortunately he is in Iraq until August. This guy is wonderful...respectful, responsible, handsome, smart...the works ladies. The only reason we stopped dating is I moved 2,000 miles away. Now here is the dilemma. I guy at work, who I had a killer thing for before I found out he had a girlfriend, this was before I got in contact again with the guy in Iraq, just broke up with said girlfriend. I could tell for a while now that things were going down hill and I know he has a thing for me. This guy is gorgeous, but only good for a fling...he's that type.      My question for you guys is this. I didn't make any promises to the guy in Iraq, but still feel like I should kind of hold off on getting involved with anyone else and wait for him. I think it's kind of an unspoken thing between us. Would a fling really be worth it if the guy in Iraq were to take issue to it? And my other worry is if it were to turn out that it wouldn't be just a fling and that the guy here and I could really have great chemistry? Anyway give me some advice here folks.
