CO1CiN6Haa	Do your parents know this?I promise you things will only get worse. He is not supporting you and "kill you" is not just talk!! What are you thinking. I know you are scared and I can't say to get abortion, but you need to come clean with your parents. You do not need him and you could put the baby up for adoption. That is the right thing to do. You have made a mistake and you do not need to try and make it right by having a baby with a man that is verbally abusive. You can do the right thing and put the baby up for adoption. The pain of doing that will be much easier than the pain of bringing up your child with an abusive, not supporting father.|`|sPr2HhYEaa	Have the baby & give it up for adoption rather than terminating. Let a childless couple who long for a baby have a chance along with your baby having a chance to live. <br>  <br>  If the father is so back & forth and mostly unavailable you may have to really search your heart and make a tough decision.|`|hxxOIm1Maa	Evidently you want to keep the baby bc of him, not bc you really want to. But let me tell you, I know things looks hard right now but there is a life growing inside you and please come to your senses and start loving her. If you overcome that part, then everything else will be easier for you. <br>  If you choose to keep the baby, do not talk about the abortion again and start planning so your bf can see you really have come to terms with your pregnancy.<br>  Tell him that you have decided to keep the baby and that you are counting on him for his support. Eventually he will understand that you need him. But please do not get an abortion. Please don't do it.|`|TNjKwlA9aa	You should probably just cooperate more with him. He does not believe in abortion, most people don't believe in abortion. I know I don't. Let him keep his baby. Try not to get in fights. If you don't want to see him again, give the baby to him and run off.<br>  <br>  This is just a fact of life.|`|fZWH4ioPaa	i should kkeep the baby leave him and make him pay child support <br>  <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  <br>  have the baby and give it up 4 adoption kill a baby its not its fault u wanted to have sex and didnt use protection|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	because he is an imbecil|`|OauZKhKVaa	If you want an abortion, get an abortion. If he won't be around to help raise a child, he has no right to tell you what to do or guilt you in any way. It sounds to me like he doesn't appreciate you, and if he is threatening you like that, you will be much better off without him. Threats (even seemingly empty ones) often turn to abuse. If you feel unable to have an abortion, you could look into adoption. I recently had an unplanned pregnancy and miscarried. Unplanned pregnancies are incredibly difficult to work through.. if you need to talk, feel free to email me. I've been through setting up an appointment for an abortion and dealing with people treating me harshly for doing so. Only you will know what's best for you. I wish you the best.|`|25FHka2Taa	well he sounds a lot like my babys dad (im 19) and i just broke up withh him. it is a good idea to leave him now before the fighting gets worse.<br>  and its your body do what you think is best<br>  but i never regret having my daughter even tho we broke up! but it does get exhausting if you dont have support|`|99mgpoe9aa	Stop waiting around for his approval. It's your body and if you're not ready to bring a child into this world, then do what you think is right. Especially if you're going to school and you have other goals you want to pursue, you will not have time for a child much less his BS. And I wouldn't take his threats lightly. If you're afraid of him, that's a red flag. I don't know why he acts the way he does, but it's obvious you've had enough. Don't let him push you around...and if you have to, get a restraining order...change your phone number...just put an end to this crap and move on. It's easier said than done but you know you deserve better. Good luck.|`|GM5NhW17aa	Your baby's daddy sounds just like my ex!!! You have the right to freak out on him, he got you pregnant & you're going through a lot of "hormonal changes" Im 3 1/2 months pregnant and my ex put me thru so much! I couldnt put up with his attitude and his mind changing all the time! One min he didnt want anything to do with me or my baby & then next he was going to make sure his family had custody over "his" baby.. Its just back and forth. But i left him and Im a lot happier, at first i didnt want my baby either becuz i didnt want to be with him & he treated me terribly!! But the baby did nothing to you to deserve to be "killed" I cant wait till my baby comes, i know i will be forever happy when she comes!! It will be hard to raise your child on your own but if he wants to be apart of the baby's life you could let him and see how it goes.. In my case, i told him that if he decided he wanted to be in her life i would let him, but im having her have MY last name & what not.. Becuz i know from now until she is here he will change his mind so much & he'll act like immature...  But i just hope you make the right decision & realize that you have made something so precious & as the months go by you will change your mind & love your baby! :) Good luck!

He might come back to you, but don't get your hopes up|`|QdhTNPvXaa	is say he does. jsut doesnt want to admit it. he probably thinks your friend is kidding, so ask him out one on one. and then if he says no, it will hide the embressment.|`|W2GLkhOfaa	YOU ask him out.<br>  Guys will say no to friends.<br>  The worst that can happen is he will say no, again.<br>  But really, thats the worst.|`|mXCA4vIYaa	use some more punctuation so i can actually what you're saying and maybe i'll answer your question.<br>  <br>  but now, since i feel bad for saying that, yeah, he likes you and he's embarrassed about what happened.|`|zu0R6MH3aa	hes just a shy boy ora player and doesnt wanna hurt you so if hes a player he likes u and doesnt wanna hurt u but if hes a shy boy then he just nervous or he could just not like u like that ask him good luck sit down and talk one on one!|`|h8Rn7434aa	If seems like he might be just flirting with you but if thats the case dont give up hope keep fighting for him. flirt back to you need to throw yourself out there|`|pOmjcVjZaa	guys are jackasses; this guy sounds like he likes you... but seems to be ashamed of it. He's not worth it if he's playing this game.|`|en6xvfkMaa	yes he does. hes acting like this because he dont want you to think that he likes you.|`|XRqlKoqPaa	I think the next step is to bang him......that will answer your question once and for all.|`|MSW5vetFaa	maybe he likes u?
qrtHvCk4aa	I agree with the above answer. Maybe he just missed the bus. Or Hey maybe he had something to do before school and someone brought him. I mean if it makes you feel better then tomorrow if he is there, say something like, "hey missed you yesterday." its casual and it doesn't mean you are showing ur feelings for him. Just make sure you are casual and breezy about it or else you might come on really strong which might drive him away. Hope this helps|`|4dXcZhuTaa	he missed the bus, it's one day calm down.

If the doctor told you got it from your husband who had sex with someone, it's because it is a sexually transmitted disease.  Many of these diseases can be cured with medicine.<br>  <br>  Of course he had an affair.

fRIEHBJOaa	you husband sounds like an unappericative butt face. you're right. maybe if he actually HELPED more around the house, you would have more energy. maybe if he actually CARED and wined and dined you, maybe you'd give it up. maybe if he actually thought about somone else besides HIMSELF, you'd be more likely to please him sexually. <br>  <br>  personally, my fiance can become a bit of a pain w/ sex too. i'm just so freaking tired. i work full-time and we have a one year old son. i usually have so many things running thriough my head that sex is the LAST thing on my mind.<br>  <br>  when he's sweet and kind and HELPFUL, i usualy have sex with him. not because of what he does, but i just fall in love w/ him over and over again when he's being all sweet and stuff. i still need the romance....and it sounds like you to do.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	I can tell by your attidude towards your husband that you dont respect him or his right to a healthy sex life but than again I dont see much respect from him either.

I will NOT have sex until he proposes marriage..... <br>  <br>  Then a man will date you more than once,<br>  he will tell you that he loves and he will even MARRY you....<br>  and you will STILL complain about it like it's HIS problem.<br>  <br>  Women like that - and you - should just stay SINGLE.<br>  <br>  Problem SOLVED.<br>  <br>  Well at least you'll never be able to BLAME him<br>  if he goes out and gets somewhere ELSE.<br>  <br>  Right, sweety?<br>  <br>  Why don't you tell everyone.... if he spared you the pain and grief of wanting to have sex with his wife and went somewhere ELSE - WOULD YOU BLAME HIM, CALL HIM A CHEATER and COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT TOO??<br>  <br>  Please.|`|RzWpNgaEaa	This is a good question give in.  Marriage is give and take the one part of marriage is sex or making love. Communication is the key talk to him. Tell him how you feel. No one is right or wrong in this situation.

You guys have to discuss how to meet each other in the middle. That's what good marriages are about.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	feels good.  helps me relax.|`|VfkyAUWuaa	You. <br>  That's what you wanted to hear, right?|`|BLaEQfdDaa	crzy life, I was married to my ex-wife we had 4 young kids at the time 4, 2 then later we have two more kids about 11 months apart, close in age, I worked crzy day hrs and she worked nights and go home around 12 or 1pm but I would be the one taken care of the kids at night, supper, baths etc, she would come home and wake me up had sex all the time never changed, Its about doing everything together share the responibilites of taken care of the house, kids, etc. I took care of the kids at night and she did during the day, we would Kiss each hi and bye as we would go off to work. Anytime you both make has to be planned out, just has to work out that way. you need to talk to him about everything and just be honest, open ask him to think about things were different, but also have to realize that the young years with the kids are tough until they get older, so  it will be hard but you both have to come to agree on things and work on it. good luck|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Girl I know what you mean. I am the other woman in my situation and the sex thing is working my last nerve. I told that old fool look I am putting my foot down about this and he thought I was talking another sexual position.

That was yesterday I have to get back to you to let you know what happens. In the meantime, keep your head up and find something  to smile about.  These things have way of working themselves out as long as you continue to talk about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VqilAWDGaa	I say he needs to grow up.

I would be irritated if I get in to this sort of a situaiotn with my wife. But having said that I think the way he is reacting is not very good.<br>  <br>  Sex is part of marriage - your work times do not seem to allow for any at all. I wont blame you for not wanting it after work.. but then where is the balance ? - in a marriage - you need life, work, family-kids, sex all hapenning in harmony. <br>  what is the use of working your butt off if you cannot spend quality time with your husband and kids ? some decisions are hard but you must take them if they are right.|`|rcut6bhoaa	YOU are right.  Tell him to shape up, or lose the woman that he married.  Sit dawn and have a nice talk with him, or better yet, take a day away from everything and have HIM do all that you do ina day.  Maybe that would wake him up some as to what you go through.  Good Luck|`|KasFZL7laa	you are right.  he seems to be acting very selfish.  i'm assuming you are working your butt off to help support your two children.

It was out of my price range when I got married, but I was crazy about it whenever I saw it in stores-and trust me, it's just as impressive in person!<br>  <br>  That being said, it by no means fits a rustic ranch wedding. Sorry!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	adorable|`|bcZSIphUaa	It's lovely.<br>  <br>  I like how it fits : )|`|ddXDh7rCaa	Its a beautiful dress, but I am thinking it would only look really good on someone with a similar figure to the girl in the pic.<br>  <br>  It also looks to be a fairly expensive dress, so I would find out what it costs before you went to try it on, because if its beautiful on you but way out of your budget, you might be pretty devastated.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	If you like it go for it.

If you really think you love that guy approach him, after you do tell him your feelings, see what response you get. For the kind of great love you have for him will he accept you and your kids? if not give your love to someone who respects you and loves you, you will surely see your world turning into a happy world... (and remember none of your activities shoul affect your kids thoughts for you)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey darling.<br>  <br>  Remember he is in a relationship. im not sure why he moved a way. But he hasnt been there for you. Like your partner has for you.<br>  You have two beautiful blessings, For them you need to be faithful.<br>  <br>  its hard to stop loving someone that you have always loved. But you need to relise that you need to. Life has its ups and downs and you need to get through this. Just see it as a hill that you need to get over.<br>  <br>  Put forward all the good things about being with you partner & having you kids & having him as a loyal partner and father to your kids.

lOR7CH0waa	Ah, seventh grade. That was a hard year for me. At least it's almost over for you. I'm in 8th grade btw. Just thought you should know that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, when I guy wants to kiss you, he might look at your lips a lot, and yes, he will move closer to you, and touch you (in the appropriate places!). The best time to kiss him is when you're alone with him. (In my opinion! I HATE public display of affection!! Eew!!) When he goes in for a kiss he'll move his face closer to you and all that and lean toward you and put himself closer to you and all that jazz. Have fun kissing him!!|`|yMAfJngcaa	haha im in the same situation. I am not normally like this but i like this guy so much and i know he likes me too, but next time i see him im going to just go up and kiss him! It will be funny to see the surprised look on his face. But this is a pretty bold thing to do......so if you really want to kiss him...just go for it girl !! Man just do it, you ain't gonna live forever and you only get one life so what are you waiting for?|`|Bt87yaApaa	there are a few things you can look for:<br>  1.yes, if he gets closer <br>  2. if he holds you for a long time<br>  3.if he looks at your lips then back at your eyes<br>  4. if he bites his lips.<br>  <br>  but dont be afraid of making the first move|`|my53ST0Eaa	yeah he deff wants to kiss you. <br>  <br>  if he doesnt do it just  BAM you do it and it will shock the crap out of him lol and you 2 will be so happy =D|`|wG9ANqO4aa	well,<br>  if he stares at your face for a while,<br>  he wants to kiss you.<br>  so get close to him even more, and maybe he'll kiss you :)|`|G7hlPbWkaa	hm. aren't you a little young to have already had a first kiss? and not even with your current boyfriend?|`|zu0R6MH3aa	just kiss him and ya he wants u and probably more how old are u???!|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	There are no RULES.  The two of you decide what's right for you. You are not trying to be like everybody else.  Wait, you might be, forgive me.|`|dXDroPtfaa	Well if he constantly talks about it..Then hey, go for it.<br>  <br>  (YES, obviously he does.)|`|pOEH4HLuaa	u r 13 thats hilarious who cares.<br>  it doesn't matter just kiss him when he leans in its so hilarious that people are now dating in elementry school|`|zY3ixLW6aa	yes, its very likely|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	that has got to be the cutest thing I've ever read<br>  <br>  lol!|`|ww3ukbdVaa	Yes, do it already|`|QFEbDUTAaa	if depends. you will know if he wants to kiss you he will look at your lips, touch you maybe try to get closer but he is probably uncertain if you would let him so you should try to hint him that it's ok.<br>  1st you should try to compare hand size then hold his hand look at him 4 a while then look away do that a few time|`|Xn7Rzqtdaa	Yep, when a guy is thinking about kissing you he will start touching you. Around the waste is good news.<br>  <br>  You will now when it is right. He will let you now when it is right.<br>  <br>  Be patient!|`|A4FIRVUZaa	Unfortunatly, i haven't had my first kiss, cuz my ultimate Duck has not appeared out of the shallow, mucky pond that is my life.<br>  Yet.<br>  so do it while you guys are talking, when he least expects it.Like, really fast. and then smile.<br>  : )|`|nQghiEWgaa	I would say that the most common sign that he wants to is if he stares directly in your eyes... if he does then just lean forward towards his mouth and see if he comes closer then kiss but you should probably be alone for your guys' first kiss.|`|CVNjSzu7aa	YESS der :D<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Amwb1CyO.qt1EGI3wmwtf0Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309175814AAA8nIx&show=7#profile-info-CVNjSzu7aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|DYsxVQ1jaa	yesss.....if he stres at you and is standing closer than he does.<br>  just sit there and be kinda waiting, you stand closer too.<br>  :)|`|Io35X5kfaa	Well is obvious that he wants to kiss you, so just go for it next time. Goodluck, hope its magical haha  :)|`|Jwh5enUCaa	The best way to tell is if you are close to him and you want a kiss..KISS HIM!!!

VbrvE128aa	Actually, pregnancy dreams for women are pretty common, and they usually represent new beginnings, renewed connections with others, changes in your life or career, or something in the future you're looking forward to. Being pregnant in your dream is usually a positive thing, and indicates that you're growing in your life or in a relationship. It can also be a symbol for how you're blossoming creatively or spiritually. If your overall feeling in the dream was of happiness and anticipation, then I'd try and think about what exciting or life-changing events are happening right now or what you've been hoping will happen. If having a baby is something you're thinking about, your dream could definitely be about the actual baby. But if pregnancy is far from your mind, then most likely the baby in your dream is just a metaphor for something in your life that's new, exciting, different, or joyful.|`|KjF0p72naa	means keep your legs together or else.
yTB2Zdx6aa	wow what an over thinker, it means she would like it if you two hung out some day, but right now shes too tired to go anywhere|`|1hciyvKdaa	She needs a nap, simple as that. Shes not up for hanging out late.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	She's avoiding you. Or what the first guy said.|`|cTNM4XIuaa	Ok that means she wants to see you but is to tired to do physical activites (sex). Sorry dude but your not scoring. Or that's an excuse that she really doesn't want to see you.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	umm it means she wants to hang out in bed, like a sleepover i do that all the time with my guy friends...<br>  but<br>  she might want u for Sx <br>  i never do that, <br>  =) hope that helps|`|O7xYvttsaa	she is tired, so she wants to sleep. when she is less tired, she will hang out with you.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	She doesn't want to say no but she isn't up for it energywise. She wants you to understand she's into you but also let her off the hook.|`|u2hpJUsFaa	it meens she either wants to make love or wants you to come over her house to make love...either wa you're going to GET SOME!!! =D|`|Jwh5enUCaa	It could mean she has had a long day or that she is bored. Do you guys have good conversation or is it quiet a LOT? iF IT IS QUIET SHE IS DEFINITLY BORED.|`|Z6fZpnoOaa	that she is too tired to hang out at the moment...but she would hang out with you if you asked her at a different time...so ask her again!|`|Io35X5kfaa	Then tell her to get her beauty sleep and you will be waiting for her until afterwards.|`|wqCznap2aa	She wants to hang out in bed, maybe get some sex in while she's at it.|`|DxL3u9spaa	she is tired and wants to hang out but not now. some other time.

If you don't feel that is appropriate for your relationship, tell her that maybe you guys can hang out another time.|`|YVS53aksaa	ignore the other guys. they have no idea what they are talking about. shes tired and wants to just hang out at home by herself for a while. just give her some time to rest for a while.|`|cmF3ZwbEaa	she wants to hang out but she is tired and isnt rlly sure if she wants to hang out or sleep....dont take it the wrong way, she just isnt sure if she wants to go out and be no fun because shes tired|`|JT10KvVTaa	That she wants to hang out but she either is cant or doesn't really want to hurt your feelings so she says she is sleepy.|`|EVtgLukQaa	Hey dude!!

jjoBO3jkaa	Yeah, one of my best guy friends does it. He says it feels more comfortable and natural. Its all about how he's comfortable. Its not gross. As long as he does his laundry and doesn't get xyz.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Tell him to wear tidy-whities instead. :D|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Its kinda wierd.|`|6lk6TYohaa	Um no that would be extremely uncomfortable given the rubbing against the jeans and ouch if u catch something in the zipper|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	No, they itch too much.|`|pj4agFiOaa	thats not normal at all|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	Yeah from what i've noticed it is, from what i've heard its comfier and easier...|`|ww3ukbdVaa	Uh no. Normal dudes usually wear boxers and pants, yeah, just pants is kind of nasty.|`|X5W3leICaa	goin commando!!! Yea ive done it like once before, thats cause I was out of boxers though. tell him to be careful of the zipper haha.|`|R6hfqGuOaa	nooo it feels weird to wear pants with no underwear well me personally i hate wearing pants so i dunno.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	perverted ones do.<br>  thats just nasty, you have every right to be grossed out, they guys on here that say they do probably are couch potatoes|`|kOoCya9Oaa	GO COMMANDO !|`|9YM0whxLaa	yea its normal it actually helps them to not stink and its more comfortable.|`|4IHe4rPYaa	NO!! the zipper hurts =\|`|ucfR5uHwaa	haha i know lots of guys who do it<br>  <br>  sometimes they dont have clean boxers or shorts, sometimes they're just too lazy to put any on, sometimes they just dont want to wear boxers<br>  <br>  guys can be weird like that, but i dont think it's that gross|`|g6p6PXfvaa	Well, not all guys wear "boxers", a couple of guys I know wear those sexy colored bikini briefs.  As for "going commando" sounds like an odd way to walk around town to me!  I'd think their junk would rub against their jeans all day long and that might get annoying?|`|CVNjSzu7aa	lol its not that odd. freedom! haha<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Amwb1CyO.qt1EGI3wmwtf0Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309175814AAA8nIx&show=7#profile-info-CVNjSzu7aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RxhBUkwSaa	You mean no nothing underneath?  Sure, it's common.  For both men and women.  I don't love the whole idea, but plenty of folks like it free and breezy under there!|`|FL2nfCSXaa	its called going"commando" and i dont think men or women should do it, just imagine having to sit down where they just sat, i just threw up in my mouth a little bit.|`|iqShn0UIaa	To be honest, Iv'e gone commando before, in sweatpants, it feels nice. It's not abnormal, but not all together normal.|`|iFJZ9fFVaa	I do it sometimes, it makes your sperm count higher.|`|MpnrgUpGaa	well, what is "NORMAL" lol anyways, if he finds it conforting, let him. sometimes people just want to be confortable....lol this made me laugh|`|AA10230993	Jeans - ouch ouch ouch that would hurt after a day of walking in them ouch that's not good.

WUwIk3Fgaa	Say hi to her. Just do it. It's as simple as that. Be confident. You'll quickly find out whether she is interested in you or not. And if she isn't interested in you, oh well, at least you tried and it gave you practice for the next chick who catches your eye. GOOD LUCK.|`|fPwgtACiaa	I would just start with small talk then once you become better friends you can talk about deeper things. If she seems to like you then ask her out. GOOD LUCK|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Hello usually works for me.|`|Nc6CaYIVaa	ask her if she wants to go out sometime with u<br>  <br>  if she says no just be cool with it and maybe she might just change her mind<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|lckgvz2laa	First of all. Go to singles and dating category. Second of all, put your big boy pants on and just talk to her.|`|WtmlI1igaa	Start by talking about something dealing with class this will help build a relationship as days go on. You can then move on to what she likes to do or world/ area news. Bring up a movie or a hobby and say a group of people are going see if she wants to go. People can back out on plans so you will have to go solo but if you feel like you need someone else there you better start calling your friends now.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	tell her she is ten- awsome!!
W14AnAOFaa	Ask her about herself..."So, what do you think about this class?" or "So, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?" <br>  <br>  Keep it simple.  Let the convo flow naturally.  Don't keep shooting her with questions though.  <br>  <br>  Compliments are always a good way to start too.  But make sure they're genuine!  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little....main thing though is....BE YOURSELF! Don't try to act different around her.  If she doesn't like you, there's someone out there that will like you for YOU! :)|`|P0EAzyw8aa	maybe ask her for coffee to start with or ask her if she would like help with anything. Let her know you are there to talk to if she wants to.<br>  Im glad to hear that someone is realizing that women do not need to look like barbie dolls.|`|TD1tA7aWaa	bwahbwabhwba bwahh bwah bwahh bwah bwah bwahbwhabwh
IvMPh09baa	i hear you.... when i married him he was a neat freak, and now he doesn't even pick up after himself anymore.  i clean, i cook, i handle the financials... and him.... you know, nothing!  he doesn't do a damn thing anymore... im so sick of it!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Mine does not act like that luckily. We both work and we both take care of the house.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Girl I know what you mean. I am the other woman in my situation and I used to have this problem with that lady's husband. Oh the dishes had to be done and floor needed mopping.Did I mention the wash.  I got tired of begging him to help me clean the house that we both were in.  Didn't make sense at all. Girl, I got smart. I told that man if he mop and wax the floors we can do whatever he wanted to do. I found out it worked. One day I said if you fold the clothes up, put another load in the washer and take out the garbage I'll give you some "special attention". It worked. He's in the front now washing windows,  I didn't ask him to help this time. That means he's got something on his mind. If I can get him to fix the screen door, find something for dinner and to do the dishes, he can get it. This helps me a lot because one, the house is clean, two I'm free to do something else, 3, it don't take much to satisfy him because he as tired as I once was.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	My husband understands and appreciates all the work that gets done around the house and helps out as much as he can because there had been times he has had to do all the work around the house.|`|GxSnVRAOaa	Absolutely not...but probably because I never have to clean.  My husband is a neat freak, and he does all that work, I focus on the kids and cooking.  We have a great thing going :)|`|2keIEMFUaa	why don't you ask him to help you so he can see it's hard work.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	I don't have a husband, yet, but my boyfriend understands that even thought I don't work a F/T job outside of the home I do work F/T inside with my daughter & everything else.<br>  Lol, my boyfriend is a slob so he is very gracious towards me for keeping up the house. :) On the weekends we try to share the workload, but it gets crazy. <br>  Maybe you should talk with your husband about this. I understand we all come from different times & were raised differently, but he can at the least be empathetic towards you.<br>  (I live with my boyfriend in a house where we raise our daughter.)|`|VaGUYYIHaa	No, he does not.  He does appreciate it for all it is worth, and pitches in whenever he can.  However, there are times that I can tell he would very much rather stay home than going to his work.  I then give him the chance to spend more than a couple of hours alone with the kids, and it helps him get back to his senses.  Staying home (if done fully and right) has its ups and downs pretty much like any other job.|`|1vJI7VQ0aa	i am slowly get the adult man in the house to do there own things / clean etc. as before they would leave it up to me and as soon as i finish it would be messy so i gave up and did what they did they did not like it/ suggested the place needed cleaning and i agree,that yes some one will have to do it one day.i said i would do my share and Stick to it do not back down.they make the mess they clean,cook,pay bills etc,like every adult should do.not one rule for f/one for m.mothers  should make it easier by teaching them when little instead of letting them sit on there fat ***.|`|U2YK6lcJaa	No my husband isnt like this he helps alot with the house work.

It is human behavior to notice an attractive person. I will admit that I sometimes look at some guys and think wow that is a really good looking guy and I am sure my fiance sees some really pretty girls that he notices. Just because a guy/girl may notice another person of the opposite sex does not mean that they are not still committed. However I probably would be offended if my guy was staring at someone while we were in the super market shopping together, vice versa.|`|jItNwbpQaa	Yes, but if you have committed then you know not to obsess about everyone except the one you love. Notice but then let it go.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	LOL!  <br>  <br>  I love jl's wife -- what a cool lady!  She is confident in herself and trusts her husband, while at the same time expecting him to live up to his vows.  Awesome.|`|h8skCABTaa	EVERY one has these feelings. It's 100% normal, as long as you don't act on it!|`|2TihZnvAaa	That is just human nature.  Everyone does it.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	like my wife says,<br>  <br>  go out, work up an appetite.  just make sure you come home to eat.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yeah, I think noticing is okay.|`|0AShsMsoaa	yes.
yTB2Zdx6aa	tel him exactly what you just told us, except that :I really don't want it to be displayed that publicly that we like eachother.|`|O7xYvttsaa	oh, come on. just dance with him! ur gonna regret it if you dont. don't be scared to let him know you're a bad dancer, then he'll be warned. but it's nbd. all you do is put your hands around his neck and sway to the music. you'll do fine.|`|LPxKxA6Taa	flow with the music girl <3. you wont know if he really likes you until you be yourself.|`|my53ST0Eaa	tell him that you really do wanna go but your mom is making you spend a mother daughter day with her and say ur going to the movies or somthing like that|`|5YI6rBdOaa	YES.|`|JxWk4GqTaa	say F.U.K U *** WHOLE !!!!!!|`|hYeS0lXSaa	okay this is a toughyy. you cant totally be honest so just don't tell him everything... you wouldn't be lying so, just be like "i don't really like dancing and I stink at it, but we should go [make plans] instead this friday. (  don't 4 get to  smile ) <br>  <br>  If you think a lot of people are guna be at the dance then go to the mall or out to eat since your peers wont be there you know what I mean?|`|AA11617792	well in my opinion, if u like him, i dont think height matters, but if you really dont want to.. when he asks you, you should say "i really do like you, but i just really dont like to dance"<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|56qTOSIoaa	"i stink at dancing, but do you want to hang out over here with me instead?"<br>  <br>  or, just dance a little. it can't hurt, and it could be encouraging to him :)|`|qFoO5209aa	Just be honest with him. Explain your feelings to him like you did in the paragraph you just wrote. If he really liked you for you, then he would be understanding. Good luck! :)|`|6vxUyvwvaa	HELLA YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20kTGvwKaa	selfish and dumb...we are in a recession, that's not very smart|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	That's not a healthy relationship at all.<br>  <br>  First off, I would find something to do like close yourself in a room where your husband isn't in and stay there until you're calm.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	If your family is short of money, and you spend it like a little kid coz your upset, you are taking away from your family because you are being selfish. Maybe you need to learn to stop making excuses for your bad behaviour.|`|IvMPh09baa	yikes... because you are immature i'd guess.... if you had a sense of responsibility you'd understand that its your money also, you know.. the whole sharing thing when you get married.. ya, so your just wasting your money also.  unless your spending it to pay bills.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I know how you feel. I used to be frugal before I found out my husband cheated on me.  Now I have to hesitation in spending his money.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	It's likely that you understand that it bugs him and its your subtle way of upsetting him. People usually do that when they feel they are not getting the things they need from their partner.|`|kyqhMuSiaa	It's just your way of dealing with things. When I get mad at my husband I start cleaning which annoys me even more because he benefits with a nice extra tidy home lol|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Because you're being foolish. I am the other woman in my situation and his wife does the same thing. Then he comes over here all mad and stuff because of what you did. Then I have to help him spend the little money he got. He know he can't come over here without bringing something to the table. But so far, its working out. You keep making him mad.<br>  <br>  Smooches.|`|39zXLixDaa	some people find comfort in shopping. and, since you're mad at him, you spend his money. (but, technically, since you're married, the money belongs to both of you). however, are there any activities that you can get involved in that will keep you preoccupied?|`|mFbPOUWyaa	Does he complain or gripe about money?  It's probably a way you feel you can "get back" at him for upsetting you and it will effect him in a negative way.|`|AA12143019	maybe its a form of revenge?
f6YsGOynaa	Honesty is the best policy.  First, you need to go to your husband and express your concerns and let him decide whether he's comfortable with continuing.  If he's not, problem solved.  If he's still ok with the situation, then it's time to go and talk to the other couple with your husband present.  At the very least, they deserve an explanation if you decide to back off.|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	If you are super attracted to him , tell your husband about it and try a MMF thing one time . That way he can be with you when the deal goes down and enjoy the ride with you . Always keep your husband in the loop and tell him everything your feeling . Keep it open and on the table at all times .|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Wow!  I personally think that both spouses would have to have a very super high s drive to accomplish such a thing.|`|krQiDGCHaa	This is why I'd never be able to have a threesome.<br>  <br>  I honestly think if I didn't get jealous, that it would be the attention I'd get a high off and I'd start to allow my feelings for my husband to drift.<br>  <br>  I suppose my only advice to you would be if you really enjoy it, just try it again.  If the feelings *do* get stronger, you should probably call it quits.<br>  <br>  I'm no swinger, but I'm also fairly sure that you should try swinging with other couples as well.  I think you're treading on dangerous waters to only have sexual intercourse with one other couple.  I believe you may begin to develop romantic feelings, or an attachment to the other people involved if you don't mix it up a bit.<br>  <br>  Just my suggestion.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9BsyKN9haa	I think it's normal to like getting that attention from someone new. It's exciting! BUT I would be careful and take what your feeling as a BIG FLASHING WARING sign! Its might not be a good idea to continue.|`|tEy9hvebaa	it seems that the guys aren't really ready for the lifestyle if they're not comfortable being nude having sex with others of their gender there.<br>  <br>  if you'd like out suggest a MFM threesome next time|`|69gGjwM4aa	sounds like you enjoyed it, but try not to get attached . Swinging should be for stimulation, and maybe enhance your sex life with hubby|`|1fd011c04b7013be44a3fd5dc118bf7baa	2 main things , communication and set ground rules before hand . <br>  best of luck|`|DuTeclwuaa	Just remember to boil everyone you have sex with first.|`|1nZzw054aa	Just make sure you all agree on the limitations.  I was married for 11 years, and was part of the swinging lifestyle for 7 of those years.  It became an issue because my now ex husband wanted to control me, wanted me to have sex with people I was NOT attracted to, simply based on his own fantasies.  Do not do ANYTHING you are not comfortable with.  One of the couples we fooled with was one of my best friends and her hubby, and it caused some issues with us for a few years, but we all got over it, lol.<br>  <br>    I met a man at one point who I could have had an affair with, but I ended it before it got to that point.  As unfortunate as it was, my ex was not as good at ending things for the betterment for the marriage.  There is nothing wrong with feelings, it is what we DO with those feelings which changes things.|`|20kTGvwKaa	This is exactly why you should not allow your flesh to explore outside of your marriage. Your mind wonders and then you go thinking of relations with other people...<br>  <br>  I knew someone who was into the swingers lifestyle, they ended up very very sick..TRUE STORY....Before you make that decision, think long and hard about the consequences. (Mental and physical consequences)<br>  <br>  When I am looking for something new and fun to do in my marriage, we take an overseas travel trip...just saying..but hey whatever works for you|`|3iNobwVraa	Wowza baby!  Why don't you just tell the truth?  Tell him you had a lot of fun, but aren't sure that things will stay simple if you all continue along this course.  (If you're the only one who doesn't want to, however, you will *have* to do it again, lol.  Majority rules.)  I'm kidding, of course.  Do only what you want to.  <br>  <br>  Just be open and honest.  Don't keep any concerns to yourself in this kind of situation.  I mean, at this point, there isn't much to hide, is there? ;)  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I'm impressed with how evolved you all are.  No judgments from me, just a little shock. :)|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Well, first, I'm not quite sure how a threesome happens without intercourse...but regardless, to answer your question...<br>  <br>  If you are uncomfortable with the feelings you are now having, or think you may develop, then just tell your friend you are not as comfortable with the whole situation as you thought you would be.  You should be able to say just that, and nothing more.  If she is truly your friend, she will respect that without getting mad.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO you will step over the line if the feelings are there.  Sometimes making "fantasy" reality will backfire. <br>  <br>  I would just say that things don't feel right and that you don't wish to do it again if anyone brings it up.
7CjF3Y7uaa	just tell her straight up that you dont want to be her friend anymore and why. to be honest, she sounds like the jealous type. dont worry about hurting her feelings because sometimes you need to in order for a person to realize something about themselves.|`|gf47jGQSaa	Hey Taylor :)  Its okay, I don't like her eather.  I am not her friend. Hana, Sarah, Alex, Athena, and Nirvana are our friends. Forget her... I bought us tix to the Talent show, so i can see lucas do magic :) just forget her. shes mean|`|cavaReAYaa	u sould say well u hate miley cyrus but hana likes her so i took her instead of u because hana and me would enjoy it wile if it was me and u,u would hate it so i took hana instead of u|`|nCFnFLCDaa	pshh...thats dumb.

a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	You mean bulimic...?  Yea, it's okay to be upset, just not like aggressively upset and violent about him confronting you about it.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Unfair accusations are always hurtful. My mom accused me of being anorexic once. :(|`|veZLfnGFaa	Yes, it's ok.  It makes you mad to be accused of something that you aren't doing.|`|K3jcdkveaa	are you balemic? if so , why would you be upset? he didn't yell at you, well you didnt say he did. and if your not, just tell him your skinny, and you're not balemic .|`|7CjF3Y7uaa	i guess its alright to feel upset, but its not such a big deal. your dad is just worrying about your well being.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	just tell him that you are or are not and then talk to him.  he will not bite you!|`|ji8J9k6Baa	So after I had moved out of the house (family house w/ mom and dad) and I went home for a Visit, Mom and I were going over to the grocery story....and she says to me..." I have to ask you something~ did you run into the garage with the truck the last time you were home visiting"<br>  <br>  After the shock, then the laughter, I was pissed. My father blamed me, instead of taking the blame himself after he ran into the foundation of the garage hard enough to push the building off the foundation.<br>  <br>  So of course I went right home and confronted my father~ I dont take anyone talking about me incorrectly behind my back ~ ESP. FAMILY~ and ESP. when they are trying to blame me for something!!<br>  <br>  This is a long way around of answering your question~ but i want to show you, you are not alone, the situation was a bit different, but still similar enough where I too went through the emotions of anger and hurt. <br>  <br>  You need to confront your father and talk this out with him. He really had no right discussing it with your brother, he should have been talking it over with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck~ and also for what its worth, I have a awful hard time eating anything until dinnertime. one meal a day. however im not skinny, but i do not have an appetite. You have a very high metabolism that's all.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	its a perfectly good question, my family thought i was going anorexic last year (im 16) and i was just going through a rough time with my boyfriend at the time. just tell him how you feel and that your perfectly ok. confront him with how you feel. have you been sick lately? that could be the cause of it to. or emotional issues like me. subconsciously you might be feeling different with some kind of change in your life. eat more, show that your healthy and prove him wrong! its perfectly ok to feel sad or upset about it, but just think, he's your dad, he's just worried about his little girl and dont want her hurting herself. <br>  <br>  i hope things turn out ok for you|`|GTKXq7A1aa	ya because its like he doesnt trust you not to be|`|rgn6YNrfaa	Of course it is okay, I would feel upset too if someone thought i was balemic. Just talk to him and make sure he knows how you feel and that you are not.|`|abhCdMA0aa	Yeah, its normal t be upset about something like that.|`|SwTgUf89aa	yes of course it is okay to feel really upset and/or sad or mad or frusturated or anything along those lines. you should talk things out with him, it might make you feel better|`|DYsxVQ1jaa	haha. i hate when i get blamed for crap like that.<br>  i always take it personal but i prob shouldnt.<br>  :)|`|0C8lOe6Faa	its normal
Iba8UcIDaa	I look for just about what you just said. I like the kind of girl that likes to show her "wild" side with me and make herself be comfortable with who she really is but just be nice with me and I don't care what else she does, just don't cheat on me.....|`|wOAAPp4aaa	wtf|`|gRXy66dOaa	naa|`|pOEH4HLuaa	omg u just described my friend in great detail who are you?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  im scared<br>  shes bisexual =)|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	go back to school man|`|1neMZoRLaa	@ OP:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.photobasement.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/english.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.photobasement.com/wp-content/...</a>|`|1jltjtjSaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309181044AA4ozip">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  ?????|`|O7xYvttsaa	no.|`|aRRQrwd9aa	hey that's me!
FiCl71flaa	From my understanding of your piece, he appears to be jealous.Everybody seems to be part of a couple and then you tell him (your secrete lover)that you are liking someone , it was the last straw .he liked you and thought that you could date but you broke his heart when you said you were seeing someone. Sit him down, ask him the reason for the change in him,why he looked sad, what if anything you have done to him,and how you can correct it. This may get him talking and you may get to learn what is on his mind and why is so troubled.I wish you all the best and good luck.|`|zNY0njz2aa	girl, he likes YOU. that's why. he's jealous that you like his friend.|`|Z6fZpnoOaa	because he likes you and you told him you like someone else|`|O7xYvttsaa	uh, he likes you!! is it not obvious!?|`|PiaT5wIPaa	well i have a friend who kinda did the exact same thing...yet he kissed me and walked out... when i didnt give him the responce he wanted he kinda stopped talking to me and now he just looks at me and when i smile back he just looks down and shakes his head... Basically when yopur friend asked you did you like someone...in so many words he was asking if you by any chance liked him... and when you didnt take the hint... it hurt his feelings...and now he doesnt kno how to act...give him a chance he has seen you at your good and bad and is still there...u never know till you give it a try...|`|i9SsCOJ7aa	He probably actually does like you, even though he may not have said so.  Or it could be that it was nice for him to always think of you as "available" and now that you like some other guy, he wants you because he can't have you.  I think it's probably the first one, but honestly, you'll really have to ask him to know for sure.|`|FTXhs89xaa	hey i went through the same thing with my girl thats a friend he likes you alot like he probrobly loves you im not kidding and mabey you should give him a chance at your heart because chances are he is probrobly the guy y ou have been lokking for your whole life but havent had a chance to realize you had that guy at your fingertips the whole time|`|LPxKxA6Taa	guys have their ups and downs like us. They get confused like us. its time that they need. comfornting them sometimes just makes them feel spotlighted on. Wait till he comes  to you. It'll be better instead of rushing|`|YVS53aksaa	based on the information, he likes you. he is upset that you like his friend, and he feels as though he lost his chance.|`|8zfXJxxraa	He Likes U Buts Hes Sad That U Like His Best Friend|`|JPt69qXBaa	OBVIOUSLY HE LOVES YOU when he asked u who u liked he wanted u to answer him idk much about him but it seems to me he's shy when it comes to girls so if i were u i would go with him i know u 2 r realy good friends so u might not want to risk anything but thats totally it he likes you. He probally hasn't asked u out bcuz he doesnt want to get rejected n then risk ur guys frienship u know hey do me a favor answer my question|`|lOR7CH0waa	I think that you should go out with him!!!! Since he's your best friend already, you know that you two can get along just fine! If you want to go out with him, flirt with him. See if he flirts back.<br>  If you don't want to go out with him, just ask him straight forward after reading the signs for a little while longer. Say,"Look, I don't really want anything to be weird between us, but do you have feelings for me?"<br>  And then go from there. Again, I think that you should give going out with him try!!|`|qcy3nyogaa	Some of my friends have done this and i no from experience what is going on. I think either its weird you like his friend cuz he doesnt no what to do. Scenerios:<br>  <br>  He actually knows his friend likes you, and is confused on what to do(unlikely)<br>  He is jelous of his friend because he likes you. (most likely)<br>  He is sad for you because he knows his friend doesnt like you.<br>  (Very Least Likely)|`|MkxYI1Msaa	It sounds like he likes you! If he's suddenly acting weird and asks you who you like...well he probably wants it to be him. He's probably acting sad because he knows you don't like him. :( <br>  Hope this helped!|`|6vxUyvwvaa	i used to have a guy friend like that too! i never really understood why?|`|5qI3RFrPaa	he likes you duh? go for him|`|1816TGLyaa	hun, he likes you! I know because i did the same thing when i feel in love with a guy friend that i knew like another girl. I say you go on acting like nothings changed and everything should go back to normal i just think he needs some time to go over his thoughts. It hurts when you find the person your in love with likes someone else. I should know... Dont give up you two can make it through this. Friendship is a hard bond to break. I hope i helped hun.|`|cKAaxQgiaa	Your friend may have asked you whether or not you and him were just friends but did you ever ask him that question? Well, its pretty obvious that he has always liked you but you never seem to have caught on and he can't say anything now because you told him that you liked someone else. And now, he seems so sad because he feels that he lost all his chances to be with you. The only reason he sits next to other girls is to try and make you jealous, but you still aren't getting it.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	well i acted like that when i realized that i was inlove with my guyfriend..that was actually last week...
a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Your mom doesn't appreciate you. :[  I don't think she should treat you this way and lowering your standards for living a life full of accomplishments.  I think to get her to stop, you should just let her rant on and nod as hard as it may be to pretend to agree with something that obviously seems wrong to you.  Do something for HER spontaneously and showing her that you are not expecting anything back and maybe she will start to appreciate you in return.  Good luck. :]|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	ask her why she feels that way.. try making things not all about you for a change. if it continues. maybe go into family councelling. your mom could be having a rough time to. although she shouldnt complain that you have interests. but maybe you are taking it to the extreme. Moms need a break sometime to. Maybe try getting your dad to drive you places.|`|RbCsBbhLaa	Well from what you said it seems like she might have some real issues. I think that she should talk to a counciler. You could talk to your councler at school about it because they might be able to give you some resources. I'm really sorry that seems really hard. You should tell you dad everything that you said here and tell him that you really need help. If he doesn't do anything then you could try to contact child services and they could have someone come talk to your mom. <br>  <br>  I'm really sorry. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|bmhT1IrTaa	well being only 14 you have a while to go, highschool is comming. mabey she is pushing you to your best ability because she believes in you and what your capable of. she wants you to show your true potential in the world. she wants you to be successful because she know you can be. work hard, keep up on chores. do things around the house that she dosnt tell you to do. like when she's at work, clean the kitchen and surprise her. ask her how her day goes and try to keep up with her emotionally. mabey she's going through a rough time in life and needs the extra comfort. tell her everyday how much you love her even if you feel you dislike her, do it, it would make her loosen up some. play the innocent role in the house, and just be a goodie goodie. dont ask for anything unless its really needed, like for school reasons. talk moe about your future around her and what classes you might want to take in highschool. show her that your maturing and becomeing a young man. dont give her attitude and just do what she tells you to do without complaints. <br>  <br>  hope everything goes well|`|jNDvvolYaa	First of all I think its so refreshing to see a 14 yr old about some business. This makes me proud as a mom. At first your mom came off as a single mom. I know you mentioned your father but that doesnt mean he lives in the home. Is she? If she is, then your mom is angry and it sounds as if shes a bit envious of your life. Did she have children young? Did something take place that made her have to forfeit her young age and become an adult too early? These are the types of things that could happen and make someone reret and take their regrets out on their children. The best thing you can do is try to understand why she is this way. Thats the first step in solving it. Once you know whats wrong then you can do something about fixing it. Even if there isnt anything you can do, my best advice to you is to love what it is about you that makes you you and DONT CHANGE!!
HzevoVflaa	Hi Carolyn, fact is the guy took advantage of you when you were in no position to say no.<br>  Fact is, you feel raped, and were clearly not in any position or condition to consent to any sexual act, however, that does not give anyone the right to use you for their own gratification or pleasure.<br>  Press the charges, next time it might be some schoolkid he attacks, who might not come out of the situation so lucky.<br>  As a final thought, cut back on the drink. you have little Felicity to consider, and if you are tanked up you cannot be the wonderful caring mother that she deserves. <br>  I would also get pregnancy and checks for sexually transmitted diseases done, as I doubt this b&%^&rd will have thought of using a condom.<br>  This time you have been lucky and survived, next time you might not, so always stay in control, both of what and how much you drink, and who you allow near and inside your body.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Mike t.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	no, you don't seem to care that you were and plus you were both drunk which means that none of you really knew what was going on anyways so the situtaition should just remain neutrail in my opinion.|`|CVNjSzu7aa	No. He is at fault not you.

If you were, keep him in jail and press charges.|`|JV0i77uiaa	You should not feel guilty.  You were violated  and rape.  If he can't handled drinking he should not drink.   This goes for you also, don't drink if you get drunk it mean none of you can handle buzz.  I don't know how old is he, if he is older than you, he should be more careful.  Don't feel guilty if he in jail, maybe you are saving his life.
CRR2NBZKaa	I definitely know what that's like. I had the same experience at the beginning of this school year, except that I'm in high school. It definitely is a painful feeling. If I were you, I wouldn't stop being her friend. You don't have to hang out with her and spend time with her, but be nice and smile at her. If you are a true friend, she will come running back to you sooner or later. Don't worry about it. Don't spend all your time and energy on her though. Spend it on people who are willing to try just as hard to be your friend. Everything will be just fine! :)|`|o80aAQV2aa	I'm around your age too and I know how you feel. Talk it out with her and if she continues to behave like this then I don't think the friendship is worth it.|`|okoUDyK6aa	dont be her friend she dosnt deserve you|`|kHPUFAqaaa	you should still be friends with her. wave and say hi when you see her. make some new friends and don't worry about it. if she really wants to be friends with you, then she come running to you

V9qmbFQOaa	Mums have the right to change their minds.It's not lying, it's adapting to changing circumstances. That's part of being an adult. Things happen to change one's mind. Instead of being aggressive and over-reacting, try to talk to her calmly about the conferences,If you can't talk without getting upset, write it all in a letter. explaining why you are unhappy and what you would like to happen. Perhaps you don't know all the reasons why she needs to go to certain conferences. Perhaps she might agree to you going to a camp or staying with friends while she is away.

He may not be able to do much, since you say he doesn't talk to her anymore, but he can reassure you that he is over her and he can reassure you that he loves you.

"why is it so difficult for men to understand that good sex comes from good loving skills...."<br>  <br>  BECAUSE THAT'S A LIE.<br>  <br>  Good sex doesn't come from "good loving skills".<br>  Who brainwashed you???<br>  <br>  I can have SPECTACULAR sex with a woman who's last name I don't even know - TONIGHT!!!. BETTER SEX than most men have with their own GIRLFRIENDS AND WIVES!!<br>  <br>  We don't have to LIKE (or love) the women we F___.<br>  That's only something you prefer to tell yourself.<br>  But it's NOT the truth. <br>  <br>  When will YOU GIRLS learn.<br>  (THATs the question you should be asking)<br>  <br>  You're the one who "pretends to know it all".<br>  When clearly you don't.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Quit you complaining and teach him what it is you want.

I focus on my partner's pleasure not my own... so those that get over my minor disability (my line is "the only thing that doesn't work on me is below my right knee, and no hun you're not that lucky :-}") get rewarded with multiple O's, G-spot O's, Oral... whatever strikes their fancy.<br>  <br>  I in return get them coming back for more.|`|WtmlI1igaa	CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! Go answer but they never get over themselves someone has to be on them cause if no one says they look good or whatever they have that mirror, mirror on the wall to answer back.  But the funny part is the mirror always said someone else.|`|AA11208683	i know exactly what you are talking about... i was with a man who worked out and had a great body but to me being in bed was horrible with him. all he cared about was himself and his body was just to hard for me to be comfortable with... my husband now doesn't have rock hard muscles but stays fit and he cares about my needs and in return i give him his needs. some men just don't understand that if you treat your women special and fill her emotional needs she will treat you with more sex than you could possibly handle, but if you just expect her to give you sex all the time and give nothing in return eventually she is just going to push away from you. if you are having these kinds of problems than i would suggest trying to teach this man what to do... show him during sex what you like and put his hand in certain areas. men with egos arn't going to listen to you if you just flat out tell him something, but if he starts doing something that you do like sexualy let him know you like it. moan out load and say something like, oh, just like that. or i like that... he should get the hint eventually hopefully... hope everything works out for you! good luck!|`|aMZivFmiaa	Well You seem to have suffered the situation its really sad to know that, well you can term things as most men because there are men who respects women and are great lovers too (like me) i belive in making love to one woman in 100 ways than making love to a 100 women, if you dont have anyother option than that person please help him develop his skills, and if you have an option look for someone who know the difference between ''making love and having sex''.. take care
jNDvvolYaa	DO NOT LET ANYONE PUT YOU IN A BOX!!!!!! I am a 26 yr old woman with a son. I have been with men all my life. I love men. Everything about a man I love. But my last two relationships, have been women. I am not Bi sexual. Nor am I gay. I see women and think, Damn her shoes are fierce. I dont see women and immediately wanna touch them. But I happened to find two women who have everything I look for in a partner. You are wise beyond years in a way you have no idea!!! I wanna just hug you because you have tapped into something that most ADULTS cant grasp. That is that sexuality is fluid and adoration and attraction run so closely together, that it is easily to be fooled. If you love your boyfriend then you be with him. If you feel yourself attracted to someone and this person is EVERYTHING you look for and they treat you with respect and they just so happen to be a girl and you wanna go there, THEN GO! and enjoy every minute of it. I know you said it was just a kiss and curiousity might have been all there is. Just dont let someones issues, and insecurities make you feel as if you have something to be ashamed of.  Let no one put you in a box. Those things are restrictive. Be blessed and BE YOU!|`|lWobDwmnaa	aw thats cute. well i kissed my best friend and felt nothing with her. but i think you might be bi.<br>  nothing to worry about, she's your best friend so i guess thats where youre feelings are coming from cuz you care about her.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	your BI|`|N6frEVbiaa	you're not bi. its just that she's your best friend and you care so much i mean 4 years.. that's a long time. its harmless|`|dL6BcJQxaa	Lol my bff of 6 yrs her & i are both bi sexual & a few times her & I we have kisses & slept w each other.

Don't be so hard on yourself your young just explore have fun with men & women its alot of fun having the best of both worlds.

lzEuuseJaa	I think your parents are being realistic. FIDM is downtown LA, and not in a very nice neighborhood crime-wise. I know someone who lives near Grand & 3rd, a better neighborhood than FIDM, an ex-pro-athlete, and he doesn't feel comfortable living there. (Just moved into town, works at big law firm right there.)<br>  <br>  Look at the safety rating - it's 0.<br>  <a href="http://lalife.com/South_Park" rel="nofollow">http://lalife.com/South_Park</a><br>  <a href="http://lalife.com/Central_City" rel="nofollow">http://lalife.com/Central_City</a><br>  <br>  Driving in from Riverside would be a huge hassle, what about taking the metro? Is there a metro station near you? You can take the metro downtown and transfer at Union Station to go to 7th, just a few stops. It would be a lot better than driving, and quicker too. Have you considered waiting until you're a bit older to go to FIDM? <br>  <br>  Hey, I have a teen son, and as long as he lives in my house, I will meet his friends, talk to their parents and make sure I know what they're up to!

I'm sure you think you are very mature - I don't know of too many 16 year olds who don't think they are mature - but there is a lot more to the whole living-on-your-own-in-college experience than you can ever possibly dream, and you are really still in need of your parents' guidance.  You will be dealing with some VERY aggressive guys, and it will give you a lot more freedom, believe it or not, not to live there.  And you would have to be out of your mind to want to take one massive debt now.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	They are being both protective and reasonable. But not over protective. Do your 1st year while living at home. It will go by quickly. Then next year after meet a lot of new people and have a lot better grip on things, then see about getting your own place.

She had so much to cope with and although extremely mature for her age, she suffered terribly from all the pressure of lectures, assignments, older students, time management, catering for her health, food, accommodation, privacy needs, social demands from groups and clubs as well as emotional and moral decisions . Then came home sickness. Sometimes we had five phone calls a day as she needed advice, just to hear our voices and family support.<br>  Go along with your parents' wishes. Accept their wonderful support. Gradually you will cope with all the mammoth changes and they will see that as you mature, you can handle living away from home both financially and emotionally.<br>  Perhaps you will find another student like you with whom you can share travel expenses or even share accommodation during the week and come home at weekends. <br>  Another option which we found for our daughter was finding her a family she could live with after living in a shared house with other students became horrendous.|`|hPGc6eo5aa	I think your parents just want the best for you.

As far as massive debts, somebody has to pay for it. Will you?<br>  <br>  You may believe yourself to be "extremely mature", but you don't have life experience and LA can be tough. Your parents apparently trust you to be mature enough to understand that, to be patient, and to commute that distance on your own.
0fcwsv7Vaa	Who the hell you going to the movies with? Your mom?<br>  <br>  Sorry. Hell, you got a girl, Thats like a automatic confidence boost!|`|ilbMPWmzaa	confidence is on sale at walmart this week...pick up some!!|`|nQghiEWgaa	Confidence is something that just comes naturally. But if she's your girlfriend then she obviously likes you....go to the movies don't feel pressured to kiss her you will know when its the right time...and if she kisses you then go for it. If you want it to be the right time then just ask her if she wants to, its a little old school but she'll probably dig it.|`|a9158ed922422742a841f62fbf1b64d6aa	Hmm, just choose a movie you both will enjoy and then when you get there, watch it and have fun being with her! But if you can't do that, maybe you just need to get comfortable when you're around her. Try taking her skating, for a bike ride, to the mall, or to a small restaurant, and then just talk and get to know each other. Then, you'll find that it's much easier to be around her, like at the movies!<br>  <br>  If you're that nervous and she's understanding, you can just tell her. Chances are she feels the same way! Plus, in the moment, if you feel like you want to kiss her, just do it! But make sure she's ok with it too!<br>  If you need a little time, it's ok to take things a little slow!|`|vycAqfkiaa	If you want to do it bad enough you will find the courage.

If she says, "more personal time" or something to that effect, it means you should ask her to the movies. Even if she doesn't say that, still continue on to the steps below.<br>  <br>  Step one:<br>  You: "Have you seen _____________" Insert movie title, preferably a romantic comedy<br>  Her: "No, but it looks good."<br>  You: "You wanna see it with me?<br>  Her: "Sure!" Mission accomplished.<br>  <br>  Worst Case:<br>  You: "Have you seen _____________" <br>  Her: "Yeah, it was awesome"<br>  In this case just talk movies until you get to one she hasn't seen.<br>  Then repeat step one, and kiss during the most romantic scene in the movie.<br>  The whole movie deal requires no confidence to start, and the date itself builds confidence to kiss her.|`|7N6F5zEbaa	First off, kissing is easy. Pucker up, meet her lips, and boom. You kissed. Congrats. Now the movies, buy 2 tickets to a GOOD movie, get the food and drink you want/need, walk to your seat, sit and enjoy. Shouldn't run into problems. You don't need confidence to kiss a girl really. Nor do you need it to take her to see a movie. Just don't be completely silent and don't think so hard about what you're doing, it'll just stress you out. Good luck to you Prince Valiant. :P|`|hfyvLLNEaa	:) You're like me. <br>  Just kiss. Just little kisses, or "pecks". (That should get you two to be more comfortable with each other). DON'T make out until you are COMFORTABLE with each other!!!!! (Meaning you should be able to talk about making out and stuff.) The movies part is easy, just put YOUR hand in HER lap and hold hands. There's no need for talking in movies. At home movies are the best because cuddling is fun! I you feel like she is uncomfortable, give her her space and try to make her laugh!<br>  Hope that helps!
gpoi6GKtaa	it sounds like love dude.  the only problem is you don't want to commit so that when she is yours and with you- you look for something else but when she is gone-  you miss her so badly that it hurts- you need to decide what it is you want out of her before you lose her for good-  you may even bebetter off being friends for a while|`|10ynxgdmaa	dont limit urself to one i know that sounds sick but it works just explain the cimcumstances to v n c what she thinks  just think of bella she loves jacob a werewolf n edward a vampire so that is normal i feel the same way exept i m single n it sucks  hope this helps!!!|`|BjyXKFpRaa	you are just trying to have an excuse and their ain't one you just want your cake and ice cream and it do not work like that but guess what better make up your mind who ever you are with will not wait forever and they most definitely don't want to be played with.|`|0lK97zzVaa	I think that you aren't ready to start a relationship with only 1 person.

You need to learn to accept what's in front of you instead of being focused on what you think you should have instead. That's just not fair to the person you're with and you know it.|`|GeWGemUlaa	Kill yourself it will all stop. :)
ZtfN4J6taa	God forbid you should marry this idiot !      And don't think HE will change after the wedding. He will only get worse.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	It's too bad that he's so bored that he has to play games with your head. Ask him to take the garbage out, and his attitude with it.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	be a good idea to hold that marriage off for a while until you decide if this is what you want to put up with for the rest of your life or not. if a partner is purposely doing things to annoy the other when he or she KNOWS its irritating to the other.....not much love in that department in my opinion|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Well it all depends if he is right that you get pissed off over things that you should not.....if you do maybe he is trying to get it fixed before marriage.....this relationship is more than just about your feelings and he has every right to express how he feels and every right to expect you to listen.   He needs a better way to communicate that though but what do you expect perfect communication when you are not even married......couples work years to get that so why be so judgemental|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Yeah, it is!  So - what are you going to do about it?  Hopefully not marry the guy, because that sounds like pretty hostile and immature behavior.  Apparently you two don't know how to have a healthy, mature disagreement.  Don't marry him until you can.  Resolve the issue like adults, or break up!  Get counseling!|`|29hcn9JRaa	And your gonna marry this guy? If he is doing things on purpose on a whim, just to tick you off, trust me it will get ten times worse once your married. Their is one thing I know about love, and that is when you love someone you do things and say things that are in the best interest of the person you love. So if you are seeking a guy who treats you like yesterdays trash, then you found your guy.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Why would you want to marry some one that intentionally makes you mad? Pick your battles. Decide if it is really worth getting mad about. Is it him or is it really just you? You both need to change or not get married. Things get worse with marriage, not better. Marriage just makes things permanent.|`|2keIEMFUaa	First of all neither of you should be fighting, marriage is something two share with understanding, love, and respect for one another. You both need to listen to one another one at a time, and I mean listen to what the other is saying with love.  If he does some thing you don't like explain to him with love and understand and he should do the same with you.  This is how your marriage will last.  Nobody wants to hear a person nag all the time. You both need to work on this problem.|`|AA11180444	He's trying to tell you to lighten up just a bit.  Not all men see that women do get a lil more upset about small things so maybe he needs to have it explained to him why it upsets you when it shouldn't.  If he cannot understand what you are trying to tell him, then he has a communication problem.  <br>  <br>  Communication is a necessary key component in a successful marriage.  It's not a negotiable one.  He is listens up or your marriage is not gonna work out.|`|bb23d735f49c71e683de7f9e9b0b0e85aa	Make sure you know that if you marry him that is what you have to look forward to? Ask yourself is it worth staying in a relationship and enduring what he does just because he proposed?  If he is treating you this way now wait til the marriage gets real hard, like throw in a kid or two! If you have talked to him about it and he keeps doing it, you need to think twice about marring him. Some people endure crap like that from their mate because they don't like change or they don't want to be single.  If the pain of leaving is easier than the pain of staying..maybe you should leave.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Quit giving up your power by letting him know what p's you off. Simple.

I wouldn't marry him!|`|jGCkjJjdaa	PLEASE...think twice before you marry this guy. I don't know how old he is, but he is still a child and will be for a long time. Probably for the rest of his life. He is just doing it to irritate you. Ignore it and maybe he will stop, but don't hold your breath.|`|20kTGvwKaa	Take a step back and analyze your maturity level and relationship before you jump the broom!

mFbPOUWyaa	I wouldn't let there be a next time!  You and your boyfriend should just not hang around her, she doesn't seem like a good person in general.  If she asks just tell her that she hasn't been acting like herself lately.<br>  <br>  And, if she ever tries to slap your boyfriend again, ask her why she does this and not to... Let her know you don't appreciate her and it's not her place to do so.  It seems like she has no self-restraint, has no morals, and just wants attention from men.<br>  <br>  She needs to change, and you can help her do that by just not hanging out with her for a while, if she asks, tell her about how she's changed, and then she'll either relize it and better herself OR she won't care what you have to say.<br>  <br>  & You don't need friends like that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|VzXo4DDZaa	You should let her continue getting his *** kicked cause he's not a Male just happens to have male genitalia|`|otmPmfNIaa	That's maybe cause she jelous and wants to steel him.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Next time she gets to the point of slapping him step in front of him. Sure, you may get hit but now she'll know to never hit him again. And if you can't get there fast enough say something like "Why do you keep hitting him?! It's mean! YOu have no reason to hit him and it's not like I go around slapping your boyfriend for no reason! Leave him alone! you jerk." <br>  And I say if it gets too bad slap her. Haha, but that could cause more trouble then needed.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if she says "I was just playing around!" Tell her that when your "playing around" you don't hurt someone.|`|qrtHvCk4aa	I am in your shoes right now and just handled it today, I am just older. My best friend kept throwing stuff, hitting and "flirting" with my boyfriend. Key word there is flirting. She is married and has kids. First I think you need to talk to her about it, I don't think that this will work though since she is flashing guys she doesn't seem to serious about boyfriends and probably won't understand what the big deal is. If talking to her doesn't work then the next time she raises her hand to hit him, grab her arm tell her to stop and tell her that if she can't respect you and your boyfriend then you can't be her friend till she does. Also you need to apologize to your boyfriend for letting your friend do this. Hope this helps

MeGehliuaa	That's fair, but I don't get why the NEED to lose your virginity. You'll know when it feels right, I don't think you should force it to happen just for the sake of losing your virginity. Having sex with the guy might install confusion in the relationship, because you're not dating but you're still having sex. I say you should wait. <br>  <br>  Good luck,.|`|yCyw4RlQaa	In the end it really is your dession i think that wouldn't it be unromantic and internment if you don't love him in a romantic way do what feels right but know you only get one first time so make it count|`|soKlEuTfaa	i would wait tell you find someone that u true love dont loses it to a friend|`|yd4bTuWOaa	This sounds horrible... The concept does make sense you lose it to the one you love, but... hes your friend, hes not your boyfriend hes not your fiance... hes your friend and if you loved him in a "friendly" way you wouldnt be sexually attracted to him. You must have more then ordinary love for him. It is great to do it with someone you trust and love but make sure you want that person to be known as your friend once you have sex.<br>  <br>  dont forget sex can change many things, and if you dont feel inlove with him yet. it just may happen....|`|b719de3702bba462c93c41379c7da7f4aa	its totally normal. if you guys want to do it and you are both comfortable with it, go ahead. just use a condom of course. lol|`|MKWkPH2vaa	If that is something you really want to do then I say go for it. But there are a few things you should know that I have learned from personal experiance. Sex changes things, especially with guys. You wont think that it will, and the changes might not occur right away, but things will change and maybe not for the better. You never know what kind of things might happen later on down the road. If he really is a good friend of yours then maybe you should try to talk to him about it. All I can say is, no matter how much I cared about the guy at the time, I regret sleeping with more than half the guys I have been with in my life. Deffinatley the first 4, they were all losers and users. There is nothing wrong with waiting. Sometimes doing something because you want to know what its like can be a bad idea. Not knowing about something can be frustrating and we humans are curious animals. I can tell you this about the whole thing: you wont really like it at first. The first few times it will hurt, maybe a lot. Latter on after youget used to it and figure out what feels best to you you will like it more, but if you are expecting an awsome experiance your first time, you may be dissapointed. Waiting is what I would recomend, but it is your choice at the end of the day. Be sure to use protection no matter what.|`|9XDQdQotaa	I'd do it. Since you can trust him, and you may not love him any more than a friend, there's no way you can get hurt but it'll still be good.|`|efsJuOisaa	It''s not wrong if it's what you want. If it seems normal to you, who cares what others think? If you both feel like it's right, go for it. Oh, BE SAFE! :D|`|sBh8U18yaa	its intended for love "true love"not just someone you love as a friend becareful because you wont listen any way!!!!!and its gonna hurt like hell so you will most definately remember this !!!!! like the rest of your life!!!!!!|`|9OOEDh6daa	no its perfectly normal if you think you can handle the mental stress of not FALLING in love with him|`|0C8lOe6Faa	wow in my opinion sex should only be shared with the person you truly love|`|ntGOF9Wmaa	LOL man talk about a different interpretation of the limits of friendship|`|LZeta5niaa	If you don't know him very well and you are not married, then don't.

I would rather lose it to someone I trusted and knew very well than someone I'd regret later on. <br>  A word of caution, though... I don't think you'll see each other as "just friends" after doing something so meaningful and special as losing your virginity. Maybe your friendship is stronger than that, but in most cases, it may not be. I'm not saying anything to scare you, I'm just saying that,well, it may develop into a relationship of some kind. <br>  I wish you all the best of luck!<br>  I'd do it. I'd definitly do it.<br>  Mama JK|`|9d20b0d4d57fd02b80ab1bb8c1dd88a9aa	I lost mine to a friend. I loved him. But the problem usually is when the other person wants more. Thats what happened with me.

I got over the fact that we werent meant  to be and im happy I didnt lose it in college to someone random. Its all about how you reeeallly feel about it girl. Dont rush into anything and trust your instincts. Make sure it wont ruin your friendship.|`|a4XDxb7Naa	hmm this is a tough one! I dated my best friend in High School...we had sex a few times and then it was like all of the attraction was gone and we hardly spoke at all and then never!!

If you are not interested in a person, then you're just not interested. Period. Trying to guilt-trip someone by calling them racist or whatever is not going to change that.

This is best done in private.  However, if the professor has made advances, you shouldn't be alone with him/her.  Go to his/her supervisor, or your academic advisor (who will refer you to the professor's supervisor).|`|GLz2sX28aa	Tell his boss because that's wrong.  That would be the Dean.  He will get written up.  If he gets enough complaints, the Dean can fire his ***. <br>   <br>  Now, if you want to be nice about it, tell him yourself after class that you don't like what he is saying to you.  That you feel disrespected and insulted.  And, that you do not enjoy the jokes either.  Don't worry about how he grades your school work after your "meeting" with him.  I don't think he's dumb enough to give you a bad grade for complaining, because he knows you can still tell the Dean.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and success in school.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	That depends. Does he look like Brad Pitt?<br>  <br>  Because girls LOVE sexual advances from "HOT" guys, don't they.<br>  <br>  So if you would LOVE it when BRAD PITT hits on you, why would you PRETEND to "hate" it when someone ELSE hits on you?<br>  <br>  Just because you don't think he's "cute"?????<br>  <br>  Noone is forcing you to have sex with him, are they?<br>  So what's the problem???<br>  <br>  That should answer your question perfectly.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Be an adult and tell him you aren't comfortable with his jokes and advances.

In a classroom situation it is very  unprofessional . It is sexual harassment . If it bothers you , Discuss the situation  with  the professor ,supervisor and with  another representative  present. Most people,deem it necessarily to pass over this situation unless it becomes a habit . Consequently,if it is directed to you and you find it humiliating you handel the situation in  stages with documentation. . Everyone has a opinion on this however,  it is always best to confront the situation immediately behind closed doors . From there a transfer , grievance, or termination is needed .Good luck..|`|kTBE4dYEaa	i had one of those, he always made sexual jokes in lectures which was pretty funny, but once i had to go speak with him afterwards and everything i said he in reply implied something sexual. it was funny when he was joking in the lecture but by ourselves i felt like he was trying ot take advantage of me.<br>  <br>  i dobbed him in. i thought it was totally unprofessional and it made me feel so uncomfortable being in a room by myself with him. it was really hard because he was the head of the course so i had to go to the head of the faculty and answer a million questions but it made me feel better know that he wouldn't be able to treat other people like that. and he did stop and he never new it was me. so if you're in the same situation i would just go make an appointment to see whoever is next in charge and tell them, it's not Professional behaviour and they'll look after you.|`|3iNobwVraa	Laugh.

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	That's the problem with words, once they're out you can't take them back. I think if someone is truly sorry after an arguement they should genuinely apologize & be more careful in the future before they spout out words. I worked on this a lot and it takes time to "learn" the right way to have a disagreement where you don't truly hurt the other person beyond repair emotionally. You can tell if a man is really sorry for what he said or did. Most of the time in an argument both people say things in order to hurt or get at the other one but don't really mean them. If you know each other well enough, you will know the answer to your question.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	We may argue and not even like each other sometimes but we don't say anything we don't mean.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Corner him and ask whether he meant it, or whether he's going to apologize.

If it was on fight, and you haven't had one for a long time, he probably didn't mean it.

No name calling, cursing at each other, etc.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Everyone does NOT say things they don't mean in the heat of an argument.  <br>  <br>  I believe everything that ym husband says in an argument.  AS far as I am cincerned, if he says it then he means it, and I don't say it unless I mean it too.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I think that if they have said it they meant it. They were probably afraid of saying it and are just afraid of hurting the persons feeling.|`|AA10886262	don't ever say things you don't mean|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	i am not answering from experience,, because i am one of the worst ppl to get into an argument and say many things that i really do not mean!<br>  However, sometimes, we will say what we are really thinking when we are mad, because we dont want to hurt the other's feelings at other times.<br>  Later, we all apologize, but I think it's important to take your whole relationship into view, and normally, we know our b/f or g/f well enough to know if they are genuine or not.<br>  Best of luck to you!|`|nk3QCoPvaa	He meant what he said at the ceremony. All the rest is blowing off steam. Don't sweat the small stuff. Work alot harder at bringing something good to the relationship, and forgive all the human foible crap that passes for day to day living. He may have given you a very precious gem. Look hard at yourself and apply the golden rule to your behavior. Are you making it harder than it has to be? Are you treating him the way you would want to be treated? Are you passive when you should be bold? Are you lazy when you should be energetic? Do you drag your heels when you should lead? Do you watch him work hard at things, figure out how to get out three steps ahead of him and make sure what he needs when he gets there is sitting out waiting for him? Try doing those kinds of things once.

We know what to say that will hurt each other or make one another even more mad.  you both need to do is just sit and talk about things, be honest, open, talking instead of fighting, when we look back at what we fight about and think wow that was stupid, let me tell you, after beening divorce and learning to talk to my ex about what happen and how stupid it was things were it was to late for us, but not for you and your husband, just learn to talk about things, dont fight, because at the end things will get worst and then you will find yourself like me divorce at 40 so good luck.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Actually I think that when your in a heated argument it's easier to say what you really feel.

IddUYNR3aa	You can find ASL sites that illustrate the hand positions and begin to learn the language online, but to be fluent enough for a career you really need live courses. If you can't find a school near you or don't know where to start, ask at your courthouse. They are required to have an interpreter on call, and that person can probably give you tips on where to start. Also, if your local high school mainstreams students with hearing deficits, they have aides. Or contact Gallaudet University, one of the oldest colleges for hearing impaired. A nearby college might allow you to sign up for sign language courses without going for a degree.

Honestly, it is the most benign way a monogamous man can fantasize.  You have to know that monagomy is counter to human nature.  So, think of porn as a helpful tool men use so they can satify their nature, without leaving the warmth of your monagomy.

gc646IBVaa	Well snuggle, unfortunately these are symptoms of an immature little lying brat. BUT... before we conclude this let's ask a few questions:<br>  <br>  The private matters between you and him - a lot of times, guys will discuss things among themselves, especially under pressure, just as some girls do. Did he tell another girl about it? If so... that's one strike.<br>  <br>  If he's hanging out with other girls, he's obviously either catching up w/ old school buddies or not including you in the mix. Why can't he be with you when skating instead of seeing some other broads?<br>  <br>  Scrap this dude.<br>  <br>  Oh and about MYSPACE... if he was able to reveal his password to you, I don't see any expectation of privacy, especially to his own g/f. These are amateur mistakes on his part.|`|1VCxckdUaa	u know, try this, if u all way hanging out with him, make it less, go with your GF in stead.

Screw your brains out.|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	no, in a relationship you WILL "fancy" other people, however, depending on the strength of your relationship, if its a strong one, you will feel no urges with that person.|`|bn7nwlZDaa	if ur best friend keeps acting like that stay with your boyfriend until ur bff an that girl break  up FOR GOOD. an if u stilll like your best friend after that then id tell my boyfriend straight so you dont hurt him anymore. its not fair for him to get led on. but im pretty sure that your best friend is acting like that jus to get you jelous. either because he still likes you or his being a jerk either or<br>  <br>  an thanx 4 answering my Q =]|`|BjyXKFpRaa	it's okay to like other people cause they do it all the time but if you are in a relationship and you love the guy that you are with don't act on you feeling cause you don't want your feelings hurt and besides he is your friend.|`|NfYCbCUVaa	sweetie, theres nothing u can do. i went thru that. i liked his friend and then another of his friends and then i liked the whole clique at seperate times and now i like him way 2 much. i love him.|`|9XDQdQotaa	Keepliking him.

My bf started college, and i hooked up with my best guy friend, and my situation's effed up also.<br>  What i would do if i was you is beak up with the guy your seeing. He's always going to make you feel suffocated. <br>  Bring up your friend liking you to him in a coy manner. if he admits feelings, go for it. if you cant get that out of him, at least bring up him being mean to you lately. make sure to let him know that no matter what, yall are friends.<br>  figure out your first situation b4 you keep thinking about major crush boy. If your buddy isnt going to break up with his gf for you, maybe then go after his friend.|`|vJvwYDGTaa	1. Break it off with the guy your dating now. Pitty dating someone is only putting more on your plate and making you more unhappy. And not to mention just leading him on. <br>  2. I guarentee after you break it off with your boyfriend , things will start progressing with your best friend. As for his girlfriend how serious they are is gonna depend what happens.<br>  3. Dont come off to your best friend like your waiting around for him. Just go on wiht everything you normally do, maybe see some other people until things with his girl simmer down. Just make sure he knows how you feel.|`|raA9vMQlaa	It's not a bad thing that you like him. It's something that your body controls. You can't control your emotions. If that is how you feel, then let it be. It is not anything bad at all. You should really just be open about how you feel, to yourself and everyone else. It will definitely make things a lot better.|`|AA11692063	this drama is no major thing, you will probaly date a bunch of guys before you find the one and all this drama will seem so pointless then. break up with the poor guy your with because your not doing him any favors. your not going to change how you feel. and its selfish to stay with him just to have someone because you dont have someone else.|`|Yc7rHVD8aa	see how him & his girl act...start talking to him more, if he seems to start to like you & starts having trouble with his girl.....be there for him & when the time is right....this sounds mean but..... lose your boy, your over him anyway, hes way to clingy......then wait for your friend & his girl to break up & hes yours|`|5a3r0Vv7aa	Yes and No. I had a boyfriend and fell for his best friend. Then he dumped me and then I started talking to my ex again. So just follow your heart and remember everything happens for a reason.|`|Rk2hxLWkaa	i'm thinking that you should break up with your current boyfriend if you are liking other guys. the relationship won't be true if you start liking other people.|`|mehbohrMaa	yes that's bad. You have some issues and you need to get your priorities straight.|`|qcy3nyogaa	You should ask him what he wants. If he says you (or something to that effect) You should dump ur boyfriend and make him jump his gf<br>  then go out. Either way u should still dump ur current bf.|`|VRWWOxIIaa	uhhh wel tell ur boyfriend the truth and probably the guy friend goit a girl to make u jealous go talk to him|`|AA11210706	this is a tough question!<br>  <br>  i think that you may really like your best friend. i don't think you like your boyfriend as much as you could.<br>  <br>  i think you should tell your boyfriend you don't like him as much as he may like you.<br>  <br>  you maybe should also tell your best friend that you like him. i know it's really hard to do but trust me--it pays off if he likes you.<br>  <br>  and if your best friend doesn't like you, that's okay. just try to stay friends with him.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|Gge0O6CNaa	jeeze, your life seems complicated... but not to worry, its not that hard. first of all you should never go back out wit someone if you just feel sorry for them. NEVER NEVER NEVER. you might end up accidentally hurting him. second you shoud have followed your heart in the first place and went out with that person/bestfriend. the best thing to do now if you truley like this guy that your with now is stay with him and mold him into the boyfriend you want him to be.... you know, work wit wat you got. set some ground rules like, "dont be so clingy and if he accepts this with no problem, then you can get ya mind off that whole little situation you got going on|`|iocCNTUqaa	There is nothing wrong with liking your best friend even if you have a boyfriend. Cheating is wrong. If you don't feel the same way about your boyfriend that he feels toward you, its not fair to him to stay with him. Its better to break it off rather than stay with him out of pity. Talk to your friend that you like and tell him how you feel. It may make things weird for a bit, but if he's your best friend, he'll always be there for you. Figure out who you want to be with, and try it. If it doesn't work, try again. That's how life is. These kinds of things aren't supposed to be easy.|`|zegsVEjUaa	Well if you still like your current boyfriend then it's not a problem, is it?<br>  <br>  No I'm just kidding. :) If it's really bothering you enough than you could dump your boyfriend (nicely!) and flirt with your best friend, or even let him know that you like him. That sounds promising since he used to like you. (That generally means he still does.) He probably gave up on you when you got a boyfriend, or maybe he's trying to make you jealous. I would talk to him about it. That's always the best solution!
zTau6hDIaa	Get out of what?<br>  You did give her name, but so what?<br>  <br>  Just tell her, "Oh" when she says something to you and walk off. Don't fight or argue or try to get out of it.|`|VALxlwYSaa	All you can do is ignore it. When she see's that you don't care it will only bug her more. <br>  <br>  In this kind of situation it's better you did tell someone. Even if you didn't know you did. What if it wasn't how much you drank? What if it was in the beer? She could have gotten just as sick as you and maybe not even have noticed until latter. Now that her parents and the teachers know they can keep and eye on both of you and hope it never happens again. <br>  <br>  As for her, she'll come around latter when she realizes she can't hurt you. "If you can't beat em, join em"|`|qrtHvCk4aa	Ok first of all you did know what you were doing, you knew what was in the bottle and you drank it, now it is true that when you get drunk you continue to drink until the point of throwing up or passing out. However, don't pretend that you didn't think that it was cool at the time of doing it. As far as your ex friend goes.you did snitch her out but she should understand that you were beyond drunk and would have never ratted her out if you knew what was actually going on. You both need to have a sit down and just talk it out. By the way saying that your friend is fatter than you and that's why you felt it more than her isn't always true and its kinda mean on your part. Just sit down with, e-mail her or whatever and just tell her that you are sorry for ratting her out and that you would have never done it if you hadn't drank so much, but she also needs to come to realize that she shouldn't have let you drink that much that fast either. Hope this helps

ddP3klT3aa	No. I deserve a good man and he deserves me. So, I got one. I didn't settle for any one. I have left guys that were good to me because there was some thing missing, or a lot missing. And staying with them wouldn't make it better. I finally found the right person.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	Not because of greener grass but because we just weren't compatible and didn't have the same goals.

DvKpx0Reaa	yeah depends on the age. like if the guy was 15 and the girl 10, that'd just be weird. it'd be okay if the guy was like 25 and the girl 20 . depends on maturity|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Too pedophile-ish to suit my liking.|`|iT0Z2icCaa	of course its o k as age of just 5 years can be an advantage rather than a hindrance . quite a lot of younger girls prefer their men to be  a couple or a few years older than them as in nature women mature earlier than men so it creates a very good balance as long as the gap is not too broad , so enjoy and good luck .|`|zNY0njz2aa	why not?|`|SMRcJVneaa	If they're both legal, yeah|`|dcqJjHN6aa	its fine i think|`|LZeta5niaa	Totally!

My step mom and my dad are six years apart, but I recently had an experience with a guy that was six years older than me that liked me, and it was plum SCARY!! But that's because he's an adult, and I'm still a minor. My parents were both adults, so it wasn't weird for THEM, but it was weird for me. Once you're an adult, everybody is about on the same maturity level.(Well, normal people.) Just as long as BOTH of you are ADULTS then it doesn't matter, but if you're 15 and she's 10, or if you're 20 and she's 15, then that's a big no! no!|`|66tXQs65aa	Matters... anything after highschool is ok...

NuvKPl3naa	well if he was paying all these years then there should be no problem getting his money back. if he did not pay and he owes back pay they can take it. its a crazy system but he will need to get a lawyer.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I've never heard of them garnishing payment on someone who pays on time every month.

AA11692063	this is an easy question. went through it myself. just because a guy wants to get with you doesnt mean he likes you. a guy has other reasons for wanting to be with a girl, like ego, or just using you to get some action. or maybe like a new toy, you were interesting for a moment and then got boring. not your fault guys are just pigs sometimes|`|vJvwYDGTaa	My guess is hes just using you as a friend of "convience". Which pretty much means exactly what it says, hes just friends with you whenever it convienent for him. Next tiem he calls/texts you to hang out, dont answer for like an hour, and then call/text back saying your busy. Give him a taste of his own medicine.|`|B1RVJOBcaa	Well I know that boys in my school who are suppose to be my "friends" Do the same thing.

If it is hot, then cold, like you said, they are just trying to get a piece.|`|WxupMGfEaa	well if you want to put an end to it then you should just not pick up his phone calls.. most of the time i think it's because their not sure of what they want. oh and when i say they i mean MEN. but yea like i was saying just don't pick up his phone calls. you sound like a nice person you don't need him in your life.. like people say " their is plenty of fish in the water "|`|9e2d8db9ed17f622395ad151f3d6dfd0aa	It sounds like he's just passing time with you, until something better comes along. If he was "into you" he would want to show u off to yours and his friends, he wouldn't be so secretive about it. You need to stop doing this to you because if u fall for him one day u r gonna get hurt. You train people to treat u the way they do. Stop him now.|`|zegsVEjUaa	The answer really depends on the specific situation... but if you are in high school then the "rules" from the movie don't necessarily apply. High school guys can be all over the place, just like girls. The chance is that he never really liked you and you were just reading into it too much. Good luck! :)|`|sOKi2EE9aa	it depends are you guys just hanging out or are you guys doing something ..cause he could  just be using you or he can only take so much of you..it really depends|`|Vr3PIQR1aa	I think maybe he was was thinking about some things.<br>  Or he was busy with other things.|`|J9p89ZSNaa	blow it and throw it|`|XJlD2kPsaa	im guessin this dude isn't very interested, im guessin hes just sorta friends. Like he's not gonna yell at you but hes not gonna serve you happiness on a plate. And that if theyre not interested they wont call you is pretty stupid in my opinion, cant you just be friends or call to ask you something? like uhhh, lets say...what do we have for homework or somethin?|`|oi41hGUEaa	Sonds like the AIDS to me.

The moral is, say it NOW!|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	I  was always to shy to say any thing like, How times Pass|`|Sbx0h0eSaa	I'm going thru it right now. I thought I was in love at 15, then again at 21.....but looking back I realize it was infatuation....and it took me 4 years to get over! Now that I'm older I have again fallen victim to this whole love/infatuation thing. It makes me sick and I'm scared to death. I've NEVER told anyone I loved them before and now I'm older and have experienced things, understand more and grown as a person, I think I might be feeling "love" for the first time. Sadly, he's in Norway and I'm in the US. We're planning on getting together this July....and I plan to let him know how I feel then, BUT again I'm scared. A part of me wants to pretend he doesn't exist (to refrain from getting hurt) while the other part of me can't ignore that this beautiful guy doesn't exist and is alive living in Norway. "What might of been"-----I think about it all the time. The thing is---is that he's a bit of a tomcat (if you know what I mean) but a good guy underneath it all---perhaps misunderstood and scared to get close to someone just like I am. I just love him. And he doesn't even know it.|`|yZ24Z7zQaa	Last night to my boyfriend who was upset, if I was in his situation, being told that would make me feel so much better, yet sometimes think, do I really love him? And I don't use the word 'love' lightly, and don't want to lie. It's difficult!|`|nnYW2jVYaa	I think that if you love someone you should tell them right i mean why not do it before your to late.|`|pVVRMPb1aa	Yes but lost out ,|`|R60QaZ4Raa	Yes, I always told my father I loved him. But on the day he died I saw him leaving the house, and I just wish I could have said that to him even though I had just said it the night before. I just wish he heard it one more time. Even though I know he knew it already.
CNbn9KCCaa	well there are a lot of signs...  usually a girl likes u if...<br>  1) you tend to see her hanging around you a lot<br>  2)she stares at you<br>  3)she talks loud around you to try and impres you with wat shes sayin<br>  4) she trys her best not to act stupid but its obvouis (yet u think its cute)|`|BYZ64DJ6aa	Flirts with you and laughs with you a lot.|`|sq2xUjsBaa	if she flirts with u? if u can't tell ask a girl you know<br>  she might be able to tell if u can't
bb23d735f49c71e683de7f9e9b0b0e85aa	You said you all were "friends" just friends.  If that is the case, you can't get angry or upset about anything he does because he is not committed to you to do those things.  Unless he upgrades your relationship to something more they you are just in the relationship alone and waiting for him to come around and join you.  I think you should talk to him about how you feel he is not compromising with you and how it disappoints you. BUT only if you all are in a relationship.  If you all are just friends they you should move on with your life, especially if he is not being considerate of what you would like to do and of your feelings not to mention that he is so unconcerned that he talks to you through im on a regular and that is rude!  In order to give him up you need to cut him off from your life, if telling him you don't want to talk to him does not work go to plan B. Delete him from your IM, e-mail, phone and your memory banks. If he contacts you, ignore it, and eventually he will get the message.|`|WtmlI1igaa	Talk to him let him know how you feel. I f you like him tell him life is a all or nothing and right now you are closer to nothing wanting all I think...But he maybe backing off of you cause you backed off on joining him.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	I would avoid a little to see how he reacts... :)|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	You obviously really like this guy. You can either confront him and flirt with him to let him know you are still very much interested. Or you can move on and find someone else. Sometimes a man want to be the Hunter Not the Hunted. So you will have to judge his personality yourself. I personally would just Flirt and let him know you are interested, If he makes no effort to flirt back move on.
T9TK229Saa	I agree with the first person who answered this. It's your wedding and the first dance as husband and wife is a special moment between you and him that you will look back on and remember for the rest of your life. 6 minutes isn't that long, especially when your with the person your going to spend forever with and I'm sure it's not going to bore anybody. It's not like there going to be just standing there in silence staring at you, there going to be enjoying themselves as well and even the people who will be watching the two of you dance will be enjoying themselves. Also, you'll have plenty of time during the reception to dance with your bridesmaids and the rest of your guests - and trust me as soon as that song ends, your gonna be with half the guests and hes going to be with the other half. Enjoy the moment while it lasts. It's your day and whatever you want :)|`|JtJxVBOsaa	Ask the DJ what he can do. If he's good he can shorten it. Just make sure you can listen to the shortened version first. <br>  <br>  I think 6 minutes is too long, especially if you don't choreograph anything. Your guests' attention will wander at anything longer than 4 minutes. Having the wedding party join in is a good idea, and I don't think it takes away from your first dance. You still have 3 or 4 good minutes of dancing together, and it's still just your song.|`|YrU8rd9haa	Hey, it's your wedding so you can choose whatever song you want! You only get married once (hopefully lol) and you deserve to have it done your way :) Congrats.|`|CzJzgeqEaa	I think you should do what feels right as for me I would keep it to 4 min then have every one join in just have the dj tell them evry one join turn up volume and enjoy your wedding. God Bless.|`|xjZNnFLtaa	Its your wedding, do what you want.  The guests will understand, and if they dont, they shouldnt be at your wedding.|`|Hfp80ylEaa	Bored in 6 minutes?   The only way that's possible is watching NASCAR.  <br>  <br>  Go for it!|`|Yu7y6yfraa	By all means have your first dance the one that you want the most.<br>  <br>  I do not think that anyone tires of watching a new bride and groom dancing together.  It is beautiful point in time for everyone involved.<br>  <br>  I would not chop the song off.  Also, I would not have the bridal party dance at the beginning.  This very special time belongs to the new bride and groom.  The first dance belongs to them.  <br>  If you invite anyone else to dance during this song, I would suggest you dance with your father and your husband dance with your mother.  After the 4 of you dance together, then other people begin to join in.<br>  <br>  Actually, I think you should do what feels right to you and your new groom.  Trust me, people will no get board with the 2 of you dancing for 6 minutes.  They will love it.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!|`|ovkS3dW3aa	You can try to do something before you start dancing, while the song is playing. <br>  For example, you can have your fiancee take the mic and formally dedicate de song to you and tell you how special it is for both of you, and tell you romantic things about how the song reminds him of you....etc etc (all this while the song is playing in the background), then, he swoops you off your feet and kisses you, and dances the rest of the song with you. (when he "swoops you up", the dj must make the music louder so its not in the background anymore) <br>  That way, you dont dance for a whole six minutes, even though the whole song actually played during your "romantic moment", and it will be *YOUR* song alone. :-)<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your wedding!|`|ICeSfYSzaa	What you could do is this:<br>  <br>  First 2 minutes, make it only you and your soon to be husband<br>  Next 2 minutes, have your bridal party come in, as well as his groom party, and let them dance with whoever they brought along<br>  Last 2 minutes, have everyone else with a significant come in.|`|NPAQxqgNaa	You can do it however you want.  Our song was on the long side, so we danced alone for a couple of minutes, then they had everyone else come dance too.  It was nice and didn't feel ruined or that it wasn't our song.|`|m4yvlk7Vaa	No of course not!  It's your day, you can do whatever makes u happy!|`|QdCwBSVQaa	Thank you for asking.   Speaking as an honest guest, it is super boring watching a couple (unless they are professional dancers) spin in a slow circle for 6 minutes.  (Think 6 minutes of people staring at you isn't a long time?  The singers on American Idol only sing for a minute and a half!)  Go with the 2-minute/2-minute/2-minute split that Bellsie suggested.  You can keep dancing with your husband -- just open up the dance floor so your guests can dance with you.
IvMPh09baa	your talking about a white trash hillbilly... and now your making assumptions about ALL women based on a white trash hillbilly.... wow, way to go buddy!<br>  <br>  Understand this first... we are not all white trash hillbillies that are gold diggers also.  you just picked a loser, thats all. <br>  <br>  i wouldnt base your whole perception of women on this one trash of a woman.  way to be ignorant!|`|294kSBhyaa	just because this particular girl is a materialistic hobo doesn't mean all girls are like that!! you should know better. my boyfriend lives at home and i couldn't care less (he's 23). you're really basically saying that all girls are like white trash. there might be other reasons why you don't get hit on, not for reasons like you don't make enough or something like that.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Why are men so picky about women's appearance? Same reason. Society teaches women to look for men with high status and earning potential and men to look for trophies to show they can get a hot girl. Personally I care about whether a person is decent and honest and kind and funny. Like fer instance if someone calls people hill billies and white trash and says that all women are unaccepting hypocrites I probably wouldn't be interested in them.|`|AA11106650	The reason why the hillbilly white trash is so picky because she doesnt have anything. And all women want a man to bring something to the table. Not all females think that way|`|GdSzrtmAaa	It all depends on the girl. Not every female think the same.|`|GLz2sX28aa	I think your upset because you are in a position that you thought would make you more attractive to women, and it's not happening for you.  I mean, you said you have trouble meeting women and women don't approach you.<br>  <br>  First of all, you are supposed to approach them and flirt.  Second, not all women have the same values when it comes to what they're looking for in a man.<br>  <br>  Don't dwell on the negative.  Average is good.  SO WHAT  if you strike out sometimes.  And maybe, you're in the mindset that all women want only money and so these are the women you are meeting.  It's the law of attraction.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on the type of girl you really want.  In a short time, you will meet her.|`|hfyvLLNEaa	Ugh, do you get this stereotype for dumb movies? It doesn't matter if you live with your parents. It only matters if you're a bum that doesn't do anything with your life. I don't know what females you're talking to but your assumption that women won't date men that live with their parents is probably either from the result of dumb movies or shallow women.|`|C9zBZWlEaa	for one - your making to much of the situation... just do this trust me it works... go to a club or bar dont matter some where with a lot of social environment and just walk up with enthusiasm and talk... girls will say no but thats what you want.. work your law of averages keep positive attitude by knowing your expecting a no but you will get your yes eventually... after so many NO'S your confidence on recieving a no will be stronger there for your attitude will change and you will overturn your negatives...|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I think you are having trouble with dating b/c of your attitude about women b/c you know one that is a certain way. I lived on my own and dated a guy for 10 years who still lived at home. He made way less than me too. So, now you know one opposite of what you listed. What does that mean?|`|2keIEMFUaa	Maybe your looking in all the wrong places, hang out at the Mall, Stores, Book Stores, Bowling Places, etc.  Not all us real women need to be greedy because most of us ladies do have great jobs and nice cars, etc.  We work hard too, and were not gold diggers.|`|WtmlI1igaa	Because woman look at men and say a few things to themselves when they meet a man. How does he look? Job? Car? Money and how much? Clean? You get the picture.  But trust and believe just because those questions are asked that don't mean a hill of beans woman date men they want to for whatever reason you should try some church functions, parks, malls, clubs.  Ok I know clubs may be a bad idea to some but I know someone who has been dating someone they met in a club for 6 almost 7yrs.|`|kTBE4dYEaa	you're meeting the wrong girls, you just described a gold digger.<br>  try looking for someone more independent with pride in themselves and dignity. we do not all behave like that girl so don't make generalisations and judge all of us based on one ghetto snob.<br>  and if you want to meet people then don't sit around waiting for them to approach you, most girls know that if a guy likes you he'll come to you so to avoid risking being called a sl*t or a man eater we don't chase guys we let them come to us. so next time you hear a guy call a girl one of those names maybe you should point that out to them so eventually more girls will feel comfortable approaching guys.<br>  like i said though, look elsewhere, that girls not a good representation of most women.
VzXo4DDZaa	The most possible scenario is that he likes you, and also thinks he owns ur ***, but now that u ve settled things out he comes back like a lil B*** and accepts the fact that this will never happen so he prefers to be in your life as a friend only.<br>  The only problem is the kid's got issues..  and i mean psychological ones|`|YWaUaPaSaa	He seems like he really cares about you. He probably likes you. Go out with him. He also seems really nice :)|`|58ScqWG3aa	Wow..I think you should just have a one on one talk with him and assure him that he's forgiven,and maybe say that you'll try to pick your boyfriend options a little better(or something like that).Do you like Chase at all?If not then you also need to make clear that you two are only on a "friend"basis and nothing more(but in a kind way of course)|`|dL6BcJQxaa	WOW! Sounds like your friend is obssesed with u. Your friend sounds like a pain. Be straight forward with him keep telling him that your not INTERESTED in him & that u have your own life & u can choose to do whatever u please with any1. Tell him to back off a little bit he sounds like he's crowding your space. I hope this helps =)|`|SGrd8ubpaa	He seems like he really cares about you!!!! you should totally date him and not that other guy. Chase seems like he would be totally loyal to you.|`|EKDnnFupaa	stand on your head and twirl|`|jNDvvolYaa	Why would someone get this bent out of shape all because you dont wanna date someone he knows IF the someone isnt him. That just doesn't add up. Nine times out of ten it is probably him and he is angry because you won't date him. Now it seems you asked him or some time, but the fact that he blatatly came out and said he doesn't want to give you that time, says to me that he cant respects the boundaries you have set in place. Distance yourself from this guy. When you do talk to him, you refuse to let him go backwards. Tell him that you think that guy is him and then get everything out in the open. Stress to him that you want to move forward and you must hash this out before you can successfully do that. You have the power at this point. You have to use it wisely. You don't want to crush him. Good luck!|`|9nBa8YS0aa	Girl cut him loose all the way around or just ask him point blank how he feels about you.
41d19fc09e68ef3c038357014a85295faa	She is your mom.<br>  And hate to burst your bubble but 800 dollars is not a lot of money.<br>  It is amazing if she is able to keep clothes on your back,roof over your head,and food on the table.<br>  Does she tell you why she dosent want you to get a job?<br>  Maybe she wants you to focus on school and getting good grades so you can get into a good college.<br>  And also get scholarships to pay for that college?<br>  Talk to her.<br>  Ask her how things are going financially with everything.<br>  See if maybe if she will agree to a odd jobs like baby sitting or yard work.<br>  Something you can do on weekends and wont take away from your school work.<br>  Before getting made sit down and have an adult conversation with her.<br>  Be calm,do not get mad and go on the attack and ask her to share with you.<br>  Let her know you don't want to be some ignorant child.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Yes, she can...you're not an official adult yet.  It's too bad that she won't cooperate because it sounds like you want to work.  I worked by 15 and had my own money to do what I enjoyed.<br>  <br>  I would check out your local social security office and see if they can give you what's rightfully yours - your social security number.  Just do a local search for "social security offices" in your area and see what comes up.  And, Yes - talk to your guidance counselor, too.  She/He may be a great source of info for you.<br>  <br>  But, until you're 18 - I don't think you have the rights that you deserve.|`|fKrMksWQaa	Sadly yes, because your a minor. But if you want to know your social security number then ask your school. They should have it filed away on a paper.<br>  <br>  talk to your counselor, and tell her the situation. I'm sure she can help you find ways around it!|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Yes, she is allowed to do that.|`|vzr8S8vVaa	sadly yes she can... shes only doing this for ur sake just wait and concentrate in school just do what u have to do and she will do hers and give u cash when u need it just make her proud|`|NuvKPl3naa	yes she can make you wait. until you are 18 you are under her wing. i am not sure on this but is she making you wait because she will have to claim the money you bring in, therefore she will get less?? try babysitting or cleaning houses or tutoring.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	parents are responsible until you are the legal age of 18. <br>  Stop complaining, would you rather she could not care less.

crxbob5jaa	Do you have a beautiful set of china for special occasions? How about crystal stemware to go with the china? Any pretty platters, new towels or sheets, a warm winter blanket, even a good pizza peel from a kitchen specialty store. A special cookbook, some frames, place mats, table cloth to fit your table, pretty vase, serving bowls, bake ware, quality cookie sheets, muffin tins and cake pans. New bed pillows, good kitchen knives, luggage, plant stand, accent pillows and candle holders. Hope this helps~|`|4POGapREaa	We ran into that problem too because we had already combined households.  I kind of just looked around and figured whatever could use an upgrade would be fine.  Like new bath towels, new sheets, duvet, etc.  If you like to cook, you can always put a nice chef's knife on there or a cool gadget, get some nice new pans.  If your fiance is a fixer maybe he could use some new tools or a tool organization system.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Why don't you go and walk around a store and make a list, or look at a store's site on the internet.<br>  <br>  Today, people put almost anything on their registry.  <br>  <br>  You might get some new items and donate your old ones to a charity.<br>  <br>  If you don't really need anything, remember that times are very hard for most people and it may be a hardship on your friends to give you anything.

You may want a really nice knife set, some expensive towels, or nice sheet set. Many couples even register for dvd's! And many stores even have furniture items such as entertainment centers or bookshelves. Also picture frames are great because after your wedding, you will need them! Congratulations and good luck!|`|pcQi36h7aa	That's my problem. My fiance and I already live together too, and have our necessities.

I just don't want to make my guests pay for my indulgences. <br>  <br>  and though I've thought of not doing one at all, I'm still getting bombarded with questions of what we want and need...<br>  <br>  I guess you could always use some photo albums because of your wedding pics ^_^ <br>  <br>  I just thought of scrapbook gear too, or maybe something like frames to put your picutes, garters and invitations in for keepsakes|`|eY83kAZBaa	A hanging pot and pan rack would be nice.

I5ccK5Qfaa	Just be like Baby, I like you so much please understand that then invite her over and surprise her with something special like a candle lit dinner or something romantic :)<br>  Good luck<br>  Peace|`|hlX3c4Jiaa	Tell her the truth. Girls are weird man I know they do some fu*ked up sh*t. But in the end you just gotta be real with them and straight up that's what they want. Just be real with her. What I mean is if you think she has a problem then ask her. '' Ey babe you got a problem you can tell me I got you '' Trust me they won't flip out unless you know you did something wrong then that's your fault but if your confident you didn't do anything wrong then your'e good. Sometimes girls just need a little more attention than you give them. So remember that. <br>  <br>  The question your girl asked really means <br>  <br>  '' Do you think our relationship is strong enough to go on. And are you happy with me ''  so when answering her question answer this one instead and give her the answer her question trust me. I'm 100% sure.<br>  <br>  Yeah when girls act weird it's normal just don't avoid them like. If you don't like the way their acting just say what's troublin you girl. You know what I mean?|`|zprAkP3eaa	She wants to know what you want to do, break up, stay together, sounds like she wants to break up.|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	tell her base on what u felt about her relationship...i think she felt kinda left out or losing attention from you or maybe basically she just wants to where is this relationship going...Or there sum thing she do not want to tell you about and she wants to make a decision based on your answer.. and yes, she definitely might wana ask for break up... you have to ask personally... force her to talk out of it.. ask her what is she trying to do and what is that thing she is hiding from you... <br>  hmm is she pregnant??|`|58df7376750b8ba74bc799eedbb69aa9aa	It sounds like she is unsure how you really feel for her. Have you been together for a bit?..perhaps she is wanting verbal confirmation that yes...she is extremely important in your life, and you can not see yourself without her. Or..perhaps..she was expecting an engagement ring recently..If it is not serious just yet..tell her what you said.."you like her alot, and are enjoying her company."  Is she expecting more from the relationship you are ready to give?..Let her know where you stand now...<br>  <br>  Have a good talk With her..listen to her..ask her directly..what she means by her question..ask if she is feeling neglected..or if you have mislead her in away.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	She's asking what do you want with this relationship. Where do you see it going, more so where do you want it to go. She needs to know where she stands. Tell her what she means to you. Ask yourself, how would your life be without her. Good luck.|`|yCyw4RlQaa	She might just really want you to tell her what you want so she can know what you want out of ypur relationship|`|dvX11ttNaa	She wants to know if your serious about her. "What do you want?" means, do you want a marriage someday, a family, kids? She doesn't know how you feel about her and wants to know if staying with you is worth it, if your going to make it somewhere, or if your just another guy to leave her and break her heart. I think by her asking this, you can assume she want's to be more than a girlfriend to you someday. Tell her you want her. That'll work, as long as you do want her, and tell her what you told us. You like her a lot. <br>  <br>  Myabe she wants to know if your just using her. And if you really want her, either way you should give it time. If your in your teens, I would doubt she's talking about marriage. <3<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PGCKZl1Laa	okay. I think she is confused right now, second guessing what this relationship is and she wants to know your take on it. And the question "what you want" is umm well you should really know that one. In other words let me be blunt, I think she means are you in the relationship for sex? what is it you want from the relationship? Talk to her and tell her how you feel. You like her, So TELL HER!!!! do it man! lol Good Luck! communication is the key to success in any relationship.|`|SwTgUf89aa	she is probably just confused and wants to know what u want out of the relationship she might be getting a vibe from you, or someone else might have said somehting to her, or she might ahve been doing some thingking.. just be honest wiht her and tell her how u truely feel|`|7CjF3Y7uaa	she's probably feeling insecure about something. just ask her about it and be supportive, you'll most likely get an answer :]|`|9f3H3xSAaa	I think shes having mixed feelings about you.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	You're gonna be a daddy!|`|AA10944766	TELL HER YOU JUST WANT TO FILL HER TACO WITH YOUR GUACAMOLE : )|`|zPe3I3zAaa	Probably she wants the break up and she wants you to initiate it. Maybe she got bored with you and she's not happy anymore. There are lot of ways to solve your problem, if you want to win her back, do the things you used to do when you are still in the courting stage. You became friends before you got into the relationship, there must be something you did before the she liked and you are completely unaware that you are not doing it anymore and turned you cold.Perhaps you became busy, give time to her, time with her alone and no interruptions. 2nd, if you are not happy to her either then it is time to let go.<br>  <br>  Lastly, Like in too way different from love. If you just like each other, she must want you but not needing you. See the difference???|`|g7aeECInaa	tell her you dont understand what she wants you to answer.<br>  Then tell her how you feel about her, which according to your avid smiley face ussage is that you like her.<br>  tell her how much you like her. but since you said she seems like she wants to break up with you tell her she doesn't have to stay with you if she doens't want to anymore (explain to her how shes acting like she doensn't or she will think you want to break up with HER and you want her to do it for you) and you will understand|`|nfRoYBwwaa	Maybe she thinks you are planning to break up with her. Even though you might not...she might think that. I think she just wants to push an answer that will change your relationship. You tell her you love her and want to stay with her...she will think Omg we are going to get married!So I suggest you just say you like her a lot and you wanna stay with her.:)There for you don't get her hopes up!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  ~Krissie~|`|gc646IBVaa	Maybe she's ordering a pizza for you and asking what topping you want, lol j/k.<br>  <br>  Jokes aside - If she is in fact your girlfriend, respond back to her with something like "what do you mean?"<br>  <br>  Nothing's better than just being blunt sometimes. It's better than misunderstanding her.|`|6MPTPYDOaa	she wants to know how you feel about her, your relationship, everything. you have to let her in. if you want to remain in the relationship, you have to open up. You might think you're letting her in, but she may feel like you're not committing to her fully. tell her what you want out of life... about future plans with her. its important to us girls that we know what the other person wants out of life. open up to her... tell her how you feel...|`|gdVpLMz8aa	She is insecure have you asked her whats bothering her? and when she says that she means do you want her if you do say yes i do but you have been acting a bit weird lately have i done something wrong!! that should sort it out babe xx|`|tHnIewI9aa	Ask her. Girls like to talk, and if she is having problems, chances are she wants you to listen to them. Tell her how you feel about her, too. This could be your chance to have a deep conversation with her.|`|qnDk8xjPaa	Shes probably wondering what you want out of her...are you looking for something long term or what.  She just wants to hear you love her and care about her and you want her and only her.|`|1m4IJOTlaa	she might want to know if you love her or if u are close to. this will help her determine whether the relationship is worth it.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	she wants to know if you are serious about your relationship, if you LIKE or LOVE her, maybe she is having doubts or thinks she might like someone else and needs convincing that you two are still good|`|XWa7pHseaa	be honest with her. ask her. talk to her. a relationship is about communication.|`|3HYZMxRWaa	she might feel like your not interested in her...try giving her more affection and attention...make her feel special...you have to show her you want to be committed to her|`|PukfhDWnaa	Say "I want what you want"|`|Iegg3SL8aa	I think shes starting to think whether she wants to stay wit u or not :(<br>  <br>  sorry|`|CYeWFPcoaa	ask her what she means|`|abhCdMA0aa	Just tell her what she wants to hear. no point in hurting her|`|uPCm3OBLaa	when a girl asks what do you want, that means she is having doubts about the two of you due to a random voiced opinion of someone else OR you did something and you have no idea what it is. <br>  <br>  IF you do love her and you guys are serious, tell her that what you want is her. tell her that you love her and how she makes you feel when you two are together. <br>  <br>  i know its cheesy but girls HAVE to and NEED to know what is on boys' minds constantly. be open :)|`|9wItgN6Taa	Well one thing u definitely want to do is just sit her down in person (if that can be arranged) and tell her you have a hard time explaining how you feel towards her, but reassure her that you do, then she will more than likely understand where you are coming from and this will open the conversation to both of you to express how you feel, girls love it when your honest with them about your feelings, it makes them feel more secure in your relationship|`|4RXVOcjaaa	women are complicated creatures, i know because i am one. i sugggest you ask her to be more specific, because it sounds to me, like she's being passive another name for passive is (head games) if you care about her, and her you, then COMMUNICATE!!!  pls!! i hope i helped you, and remember  to shower her with attention, and respect, and devotion.|`|VUhji7tMaa	first tell her she is very pretty and shes very smart<br>  next tell her that you want to hang out a lot more<br>  then tell her that you would like to know how she feels about you and what she wants|`|vPrYhd7Eaa	i think she;s thinking of going to the next stage by asking you what you want in a woman (exept for what everyguy wants) and she wants to know how you feel about her...i need a better life -_-|`|K0LvwAmJaa	i think she means how u feel about her. and what you want is what she will do to make u like her more i guess O.o...............|`|fDi3gaDdaa	My guess is like either just company, or someone to love, or sex or whatever.|`|J9p89ZSNaa	shes probably not satisfied|`|weHTFbB1aa	she mite be preg but worried to tell u in case you leave her

dHqCEcrJaa	OK Let me start by telling you I am a grown-up with children not to much younger than you.  It is very normal to start exploring your sexuality at about that age...but I need you to remember that the decisions you make now will affect future relationships.  I think it is fair to say that wile the affection you have for your boyfriend is wonderful and it is a teaching tool so you can learn how to make relationships work. I am sure you don't know at age 15 that he is the ONE.  I am not saying not to explore these feelings (That is dumb and you would not listen anyway) but be responsible and take it slow.  Heartbreak is unavoidable in life so make sure you have that experience under your belt before you make decisions you cant take back.  So I guess to answer your question "A kiss is just a kiss" just make sure not to get to carried away to fast.  <br>  <br>  Best Wishes <br>  <br>  K|`|mFAJG2E8aa	I'll be 15 in September and my boyfriend will be 16 in April, and we've done EVERYTHING but vaginal sex -- we've done oral and all the other stuff. ;]|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Nothing wrong with kissing.

Your fine, but when I was 15, I wouldn't have minded if I went further, which means you have to control what you allow.

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	It's not ruined, you did the right thing by acting casual & leaving the room. Just forget about it, don't bring it up & you will still be surprised at where, when & how he asks the big question.|`|4POGapREaa	It wasn't your fault so you don't need to feel bad about it.  It's not like you snooped on his phone & found Robbins Bros. Be nice to yourself.  <br>  <br>  My surprise proposal got ruined too (by both of us really) but we just laughed it off & he decided to dangle the ring in front of me for a while so I would behave better LOL!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	oh honey dont feel bad, it was the dumb lady on the phones fault, not yours<br>  <br>   like, if he wanted it to be a surprise then the jewelry store should have thought of some code word.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	First of all, calm down.  Do some deep breathing or something.  You have not done any permanant damage.<br>  <br>  Next tell him that you were sorry about your unusual behavior the other day; but, you were just in a strange mood.  He does not have to know why.   Tell him that you hope it did not make him feel uncomfortable; and if it did, you are very sorry.<br>  <br>  Then try to stay calm and move forward - very happily!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Just put it out of your mind, stop guessing and all, and act like nothing happened, its fine ok. You do not know what the ring looks like, you dont know its an engement ring, it could be a promise ring, so since you know nothing, act like it.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Don't let him know you heard. It'll still be a surprise as you don't know when he's going to give it to you or what it's going to look like.|`|bcZSIphUaa	Stop worrying and start getting excited.<br>  <br>  Isn't it TOO cute that he in trying to find out what you like in rings and making phone calls to jewellers!<br>  <br>  I think it's adorable!<br>  <br>  It shows how hopeless he is at hiding things from you...which is really sweet... <br>  <br>  I got engaged a couple of weeks ago and I knew that it was happening! My Fiance couldn't keep it a secret : )<br>  <br>  Even though I knew he was going to ask me it didn't make it any less special! I still cried!!!!!!!!!!! My Fiance even told me when he went to my parents house to ask them permission! We share everything and we shared the engagement process together too : )|`|HcboXOmjaa	It's not ruined! You still don't know when he is going to do it.  Just try not to act differently about it since you know it's coming and pretend you didn't hear what was said on the phone. I'm kinda in the same boat as you, I just pretend that I don't know it's coming, and I don't know exactly when it's coming, so it's still exciting for both of us!|`|6N5U9Fy2aa	Haha, awh... he should understand... Obviously your friends know about it, so just tell them what happened and how you feel bad and it will most likely get back to him ! It'll all blow over and you'll remember that moment for the rest of your life and you's will be able to look back on it and laugh ! and one day you'll tell your kids... he's probably feeling bad more than you do, but if your friends tell him, then he will know and not feel bad and you will not have a reason to either !<br>  <br>  <br>  (:|`|wGyDRhT7aa	It's not ruined. You know it's coming, but you don't know when, you don't know what the ring will look like and most importantly, you don't know how he'll do it or what he'll say. Which is the best part.|`|crxbob5jaa	He might think you didn't hear and is glad you had to leave at the moment. I wouldn't worry about it. Just keep quiet and see what happens. You didn't ruin anything.|`|675390202407ced9223dcc6b917599d2aa	It'll still be a big surprise if it's not an engagement ring he was asking about but some other piece of jewelery!|`|2Av3gIqgaa	Don't worry about it, I'm sure that it will still be perfect.  <br>  <br>  I ruined mine too.  My boyfriend wanted to go look at Christmas lights and I had been at work all day and didn't feel like going.  I begged to go another night and he said no.  He's the most impatient person in the world and he couldn't wait so he ended up proposing in our living room! <br>  <br>  I couldn't be happier.  It doesn't matter where or how it happens.  What matters is the person doing the asking and IF you want to actually marry them.<br>  <br>  Don't bring it up.  Just leave it alone.  He may be freaked out right now but chances are that he was freaked out before that he was going to propose in the first place.  He'll do it when he's good and ready.  Now is the time to be excited cause it sounds like he's planning something really special.<br>  <br>  Enjoy it!  Good luck!|`|7WbehQZjaa	If you let it ruin the moment for you, then it will ruin the moment for him. Just because this is all happening doesn't always mean he's proposing. Maybe he's getting you a necklace and it's just coincidence that your friends are asking about rings. Unlikely, but its true. Just pretend that you haven't clued into it, a surprise is still a surprise because you don't know when, and you don't know what it's going to look like. My fiance designed mine through a private jeweller and I'm told it took over 6 months from the point he met her to it being done. He may not have the ring until summer and the more you think about it, the more disappointed you'll feel when it's not happening.<br>  <br>  The only way I'd talk to him about it is if you're not sure that you want to be with him the rest of your life. Then I'd casually ask him about getting married (sooner than later so maybe he can cancel the ring for now) and where he sees himself in the future, and mention that you see yourself getting married maybe 5 to 10 years down the road and let him know other goals you have in mind first, like travelling or school.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|T9TK229Saa	You didn't ruin it for him, that lady from Robbins Bros. did. What she should have done was ask him what times to call would be best for him so this kinda thing wouldn't have happened. But I wouldn't worry or feel bad about it, because as long as you say yes - I'm sure it will just as special and unforgettable for the both of you :)|`|zksF3gj9aa	Of course it's not ruined. Both of you will laugh it off on your honeymoon :D Congratulations if you say yes and if he proposes officially!|`|kiLcWtW1aa	just calm down and its not your fault just bad timing on his part. Its not ruined hey my grndmother called my cus and asked her did she say yes and he hadnt engaged to her yet lol|`|sooxreyoaa	that sucks,im sorry|`|frsgCm3Daa	I think that as long as you both put it out of your thoughts for a while, it will turn out ok...If its something you both want, its going to be special no matter what. I knew about my ring in advance, but I never knew the time, the place, or the circumstance regarding the proposal. Even though I knew he bought the ring, I was still very surprised and happy when the actually proposal occurred. Just let time go by, and someday when you least expect it, that moment will happen, and it won't  be ruined at all, it will be wonderful!
RRrCu9aiaa	wtf?<br>  a threesome?, you slept with someone else, you hurt him.<br>  you got to say sorry, not a god dam threesome|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	If he's upset that you were 'with' somebody else I really don't see how a threesome would 'get him back' My advice; Don't waste your time on someone who doesn't want you no matter how much you love them.

I don't know this guy so maybe he would go for that, maybe he wouldn't but either way I don't believe it will make him love you again. <br>  <br>  Offering sexual favors(which you may or may not be comfortable with) isn't the way to go to win back your ex. You've hurt him in the past so he's going to need to be able to trust that you won't hurt him like that again. I don't see how a threesome is going to sort that out. I would say tell him how you feel and hope for the best. Think it through first though because you could be jeopardizing a good friendship. Best of luck.|`|WKAqqYXEaa	Think about why you broke up in the first place.<br>  Is a threesome really going to fix everything that went wrong the first time around?<br>  <br>  You need to re-evaluate your feelings and why you want to be in a relationship (relationship between two people, not three).|`|fPpmgxjuaa	wow well having a threesome isnt gonna fix the prob...thing is i dont think he trusts u cuz what u did..it was only a week and u was messin around wit someone else...that says to him she got over me and i didnt mean that much to her.  if that happened to me i wouldnt get back wit the girl either...it would be the other way around..if its been weeks and she dont talk to any guys then i would def try the relationship again...give it some time and watch what you do...all you can do is show him that he can trust you and that he means more to you than that. put urself in his shoes..what would u do? how would u feel? especially if u are the only one he's been with then he is really hurt.|`|zprAkP3eaa	That is so stupid, you just shouldn't have did that.

That would make you even.|`|YWaUaPaSaa	Thats cold. Just don't go out or have sex with anyone for a while like 9 months and make sure he knows your waiting fort him. Good luck.|`|GxSnVRAOaa	A threesome with two girls I hope, not two guys...you know as fun as that sounds, it's not a good way to get somebody back.  In fact, it's probably the wrong way to repair a relationship, the only couples who should attempt threesomes are people very very very secure in their relationships.  They can be emotionally crippling to those who aren't ready.|`|xs5J6VJTaa	I really don't think telling him you would have a threesome will win him back!!<br>  I think you need to just give it time. It would have hurt him that you had sex with someone else so soon after you broke up. He would be more than likely thinking that you got over it all really quickly and moved on. You should tell him that this is not the case. Tell him you made a bad decision and that you still love him.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Have some self respect! Yeah, a threesome would turn him on while you are in the act, but what happens after? Chances of him sleeping with another girl , considering that he has had only you, are pretty high. If you truly love him and want him to love you....be a class act and don't fall for anything that will make you look like a **** in the end.|`|fQSEzuoEaa	In a verry big way, you sound like a sex addict. No offence.  I don't know the guy but maybe he want more than Sex so a threesome woulden't do much. Just tell him how you feel and that you really wan't to be with him. It was a mistake and you wont ever do it again. AND I HOPE YOU WONT!|`|l7E3EreXaa	If he actually goes along with your threesome idea he so doesn't love you. And why would you even bring another person into your "love" for him? It seems that a third person is a problem already. Just leave him alone and move on. You've already taken one step towards that by sleeping with someone else.|`|0yh3bcjpaa	dont think thats a good idea. just dont date any guys for awhile you can still flirt a little cause that will get him a little jealous, still show him that your into him, and the chemistry and feelings will come back. give it time|`|KUile4nLaa	well if by ex you mean boyfriend and by boyfriend you mean brother i wouldn't do it|`|NlYGbqnkaa	that won't do it... The only thing for you to do is sit down and have a talk with him. Tell him your feelings and listen to his response. Explain to him you can't be his friend. You can't stand by and watch be with and care about other women when you harbor the feelings that you have. Tell him you love him enough to let him go. If you doing all of the things that a girlfriend does without actually being his girlfriend he will never want you like that. If he is having his cake... you.... and eating it to.... someone else. Then there is no void left in his life like there is in his. Tell him you hope he finds what ever it is he is looking for and leave him alone. Don't call don't answer when he calls. It won't be long before he really misses the special relationship he can only have with you and he'll be begging to come back. Time is the only thing that fixes pain. But as long as knows he has you he may not want you.
nht23juVaa	I was having the same problem you're having too!! When I first called him sweetie he was surprised, but he had a big smile on his face.<br>  <br>  So try a couple different names such as, sweetie, sweetheart, honey, etc. and see what he likes the best :]|`|o3nlj6wGaa	We or should i say i have no girlfriend and want one very badly so i don't know|`|J9p89ZSNaa	prince dick|`|XlFMwaasaa	call him needle-dik|`|WUZwxdICaa	i like being called big daddy. this will stroke his ego
OJCoKwxxaa	talk about drinking and drugs in class, you'll make some friends.<br>  no joke|`|YWE5YIRJaa	i would try to be more open to people and just talk to them and yeah its normal i used to feel that way so no biggy so just try to be more outgoing:)
26ubZfbFaa	it sounds to me like you did the right thing. being in a relationship when you're already stressing about other things is a bad idea. a break is probably something that would be good for both of you. when you get your life settled and are able to think clearly, you will know what to do and you will know if you made the right choice for sure, but i personally think that what you did was for the best.|`|rB1bJAdtaa	I feel you did that right thing. If you two wouldn't talk or see eachother, it wouldn't be a strong relationship.<br>  I hope it works out for the best.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|YyUCDprVaa	wat u did was rite. it will b hard to have a relationship long distance but it is possible. (but don't really count on it) <br>  <br>  u gave him some freedom and i really like that. <br>  <br>  good luck!
YyUCDprVaa	yeah he likes u. he might be very protective of u, but that just might b his way of showing that he loves u and cares a lot about u. i once broke up with a guy because he was over protective. my next boy friend and i never talked and it was almost as if he didn't like me. I wish i hadn't broken up with the other guy who was over protective. Over protective is better than negligent.

mFZeEm9paa	Oh my God you poor thing! That sounds like rape to me, because you assumed it was someone who it wasn't. I would just be honest and tell your boyfriend. Hopefully he understands, and it hasn't happened since then, so you should have nothing to worry about. He will be hurt at first, but really it is his brother who should have known better here, not you who innocently thought you were sleeping with your boyfriend. What a situation. Just be honest and tell them as soon as possible. The longer you hold this in the harder it is going to be on you, and the baby. Stress isn't good for a mom to be!! Good Luck!|`|2DzIw3Cvaa	It's hard to say what you should do. I think that if your boyfriends really loves you and you both have a close bond together, just let him know what happened. If you two aren't that close and you think he may be so upset, he would harm you in any way, then keep it a secret. You may want to sit down with your boyfriend and his brother together and tell them both at the same time. I hope things work out for you. I know this is bad to say, but if things get really bad, like bab bad, and you need extra cash desperately, you can always try to file for rape. Good luck.|`|o3nlj6wGaa	ABORTION|`|289ccf15e18e573af11aa60d253dc3bfaa	I would say that there is no easy way out of this.<br>  You should sit down with your BF and tell him first.<br>  See what happens.<br>  After that you need to talk to the brother.<br>  Unfortunately you have to face the fire.<br>  I'd practice the conversation in your head for a day before doing it.<br>  Make sure neither of you are drinking when you do it.|`|KTbo7dWlaa	WOW..... That is really bad for your boyfriends brother to take advantage of you like that! I would talk to your doctor about your options.

QGd4bFERaa	You are in a situation which requires much delicacy. Even if you aren't supposed to be on MySpace, the fact is that you were, and through that, you were contacted by your biological relatives. <br>  <br>  You may feel tempted not to tell your parents, but it really comes down to trust. Your parents found you and your brother in need of love, care, and a good home. They've loved you, provided for you, and no doubt helped you during stressful times in your life. Even if you think you will get in trouble for going on myspace, you need to tell your parents about this if you wish you pursue it.<br>  <br>  Going around your parents backs about anything, especially something like this, is the wrong way to go. Even though they raised you, deep is the seed in their mind that they aren't your REAL parents. Imagine how they would feel if they find out later on down the line; they would probably feel a little insecure and upset.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk to your biological family, go for it, but give your parents more credit. It might be difficult, but they'll understand. If you feel there is one of your parents whom you feel closer to, approach them first. Just talk to them and tell them how you feel. <br>  <br>  Things will work out for the best. :)<br>  <br>  Signed,<br>  Victor K.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Don't feel like you need to talk to them, it is your choice.|`|TeailU2iaa	What a situation !!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You must know why you were given to other parents...... You must know the reason for that and you should judge your biological parents by that (May be the biological parents were abusive etc.....) You must know the proper reason. Then you must come to the conclusion whether you should contact them or not.<br>  <br>  If your present parents finds out about it you must understand how they would feel about it... After all they have been raising you for 15 years.<br>  <br>  I think if you wish keeping touch with your brother is no problem, but make sure you don't give away your address or phone no.... who knows who you are contacting with.... may be someone pretending to be your brother......<br>  <br>  You are 17 now if you really want to keep in touch with them you should wait till you are 18 because then you can make your own decisions.<br>  <br>  Conclusion....<br>  * It is ok to contact your brother, but make sure you don't revel your whereabouts.<br>  * Know why you were given to foster parents, the answer will make you decide whether it is ok to contact your biological parents.<br>  * wait till you are 18 to make serious decisions<br>  * Be honest with your foster parents.....<br>  <br>  Please forgive me if any of my words hurt your feelings. I wrote them because I really like to help you.<br>  <br>  good luck
dpU2vyjzaa	Just take the lead and go for it. If he is worried about you, just show him your confidence and do it!<br>  <br>  All guys have a weakness, no matter how religious they seem. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XwyUATsKaa	You have to have a conversation with him about what he's interested in doing. Don't just guess what's on his mind.  Ask!  This shows maturity on your part--a kind of maturity you need to have when you decide to engage in physical activity.<br>  <br>  Good luck...talk to him.|`|flMOEeNnaa	You... make a move?
ktEfBhszaa	Well, obviously, there is no definite answer to this. It is a case by case basis thing. <br>  There are a few questions to consider:<br>  How long did you know her prior to dating her? <br>  If you knew her for a solid amount of time (at least a month) before you started dating, then she probably warmed up to you and gradually became less interested in him. So that week interval wasn't necessarily the starting point of her getting over him.<br>  <br>  How often does he show up in her life?<br>  If she still talks to him often, hangs out with him often, talks about him a lot then you have reason to be worried. If all she's mentioned about this guy is "oh by the way, I once dated this guy" then you should be okay. Especially if you feel your current relationship is strong.<br>  <br>  But the main thing you should know is that week isn't necessarily the starting point of getting over him. She could have spent time getting over him towards the end of her relationship. Also if she was the one that broke up with him, then it would also make me lean towards she's over him.|`|XE9p3Oumaa	Logically I think so. If I had ever broken with my girlfriend it would take a lot longer than that, but we have been together for 3 years now. I think that in the longevity of 2 months she should have a clear mind. Ask yourself "has she been talking about him a lot?" If she has then she has not gotten over him. In my opinion she has had enough time to think about it, a "rebound" usually happens really quick like if she had gotten with you after 1 week or something.|`|yabPwimYaa	For a two year relationship, she probably still has some feelings left for him but then again if she did, she wouldn't go into another relationship that quickly. In my opinion, if she broke up with him, then she most likely doesn't like him anymore but if he broke up with her then it's a different story. My advice is to ask her to be honest with you and tell you what she feels inside.|`|IZdR8cMDaa	Well, the sad thing is it could go either way, but you might not know for a while.  I think that girls need more time to recover, so bad for you.  The fact that she dumped him is good for you, but why did they break up?  And to whoever said be less nosy, go ahead, be nosy, pasts effect the present.  The 6 month thing is good, however, really, compared to 50 years of marriage not that long.  Maybe you should be honest with her?  Just tell her that youre nervous.|`|2nPwq257aa	She didn't. Girls are almost NEVER without a bf (or a "friend"). I wouldn't even be that surprised if there was an "overlap" that you don't know about.<br>  <br>  "women are like monkeys, they don't let go of one branch until they have a firm grasp on another" -a famous weirdo<br>  <br>  Say what you want, this is true WAYYYYYY more often than it is not.|`|2F5trekvaa	honestly no.<br>  theres no way in hell.<br>  not after two years.<br>  she probably did like you, thought you were someone that could help her get over him and forget about him.<br>  she does like you im sure, but im sure she still has something for this guy. despite what she says, feelings dont go away that quick.|`|ndVPHfmaaa	Obviously she is with you now.. why worry?  She is choosing to be with you.  I would be worried or upset if he was in her life everyday and things hadn't changed.  Enjoy the girl, and the time spent with her.  Let it be.|`|66tXQs65aa	DUDE!!! Same spot! Except mine was 8 months and we've been together 3 weeks... Idk what to tell you... I keep messing up big time... I know i shouldnt be nosy and pry, but i do... If you can figure out the answer to your question hit me up! lol|`|47WmUn7Uaa	Sounds like you were a rebound relationship that turned into something more.|`|S4bG0i1Faa	It depends on why they broke up. If it was something bad then yeah and if you are a guy she really likes then I doubt she still cares about that guy.|`|XYFekQMDaa	well if she broke up with him then that should mean shes not interested in him anymore. talk to her about it, just dont make her uncomfortable|`|oveuCssqaa	you know what they say, the best way to get over a guy is to get under another one.|`|9GXCStqxaa	Might not be but maybe she just wants to move on|`|CYeWFPcoaa	she could've|`|my53ST0Eaa	nooooo...<br>  your a rebound. <br>  but give her a chance|`|zprAkP3eaa	You were her rebound, she needed to feel loved, she was hurt.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Do but don't let the X back into the picture|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	I got over my ex that quickly, and that was because i spent the last 6months of those 2years getting over him and just grasping at straws trying to stay together cause i didn't know if i could handle us breaking up. If she got to the point where she broke up with him. then yeah i'd say she was over him.|`|7CjF3Y7uaa	honestly, i think she's wasnt entirely over him when you guys started dating. i've been with the same guy for over 2 years now, and i dont think i'd be able to get over him so quickly! >< but she's probably over it by now because she's got you :D|`|9YM0whxLaa	no i doubt it im sorry<br>  ive been with m guy 4 years and thinking back when we were together 2 years <br>  hell no i wouldnt be over him that fast!!!<br>  im sorryyyy|`|ilbMPWmzaa	possible...but everyone is different. talk to her|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Just because they recently broke up doesn't mean their relationship was butterflies and rainbows before then. It could have been horrible for months, but they were trying to work on it. So then finally they ended it. There is a chance that you are just a rebound man, yes. However, if she tells you she has feelings for you, you should go with it. Unless she is constantly bringing up her ex, or constantly associating herself with him then you should have no reason to think that she is not over him. If you're truly that concerned, you should talk to her about it. If you two are in a relationship, then you should be able to be talk to her about this issue. You should take the initiative to communicate with her about this issue. You have a right to know where the relationship is headed, and whether you two are on the same page about that or not. Good luck with everything.|`|bWgF0NoTaa	i don't want to say this, but be careful.. it seems like you may be a rebound..<br>  <br>  my ex and i dated for 3 years and we broke up in august.. he said he fell out of love with me, but i still loved him.. i'm not in love with him anymore, but neither of us have moved on yet.. we're still friends and we still talk on the phone and text almost everyday.. we even hang out still.. but nothing more..<br>  <br>  i think it's crazy how people move on so fast after a long term relationship.. it's not healthy for a new relationship..<br>  <br>  just be careful.. don't allow yourself to get hurt if you really care about this girl..<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|BjyXKFpRaa	hell no you are just a rebound man, and they are used to make the other person mad,and when that happens and the other person see you together they try to get back together so nope she is not over him that fast.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	Careful, you might be rebound until she knows for certain her and her ex aren't getting back together.|`|0C8lOe6Faa	no she didnt but maybe she has by now but i can asure you that she wasnt over her ex after a week|`|GTKXq7A1aa	depends on why they broke up.|`|erw1bkogaa	You guys ok right now, right?  Then quit sweating this.|`|1BnIw3DEaa	yes she did. dont be so nosy.
4OL8VRzNaa	Try different positions|`|gEd1jlOEaa	you are young honey! It will get better in time|`|vWPq8nS2aa	Well to make you feel better a recent study showed that the average guy only lasts around 5-10 minutes so don't get intimidated by those porno's that last longer that gone with the wind. lol First stop thinking about your orgasm. press DON'T THRUST. masturbation is normal, so my advise is to practice. And remember there can always be a round two. Hope this helps.|`|2wZhVA8faa	1) Learn to stop! Don't go at it like a bull in a china shop. If you feel yourself getting close to the point of no return STOP. Withdraw your penis and change what you were doing.<br>  <br>  2) Breathing. Control your breathing through your nose with deep breaths. This will slow your whole excitement and put you back in control.<br>  <br>  3) Wear a condom. A cheap and easy (and not at all suspicious) way to reduce sensitivity to your penis (particilarly the tip (glans)), thus helping you to last longer.<br>  <br>  4) Stimulate your partner. Forget about yourself. Almost as much pleasure (without the ejaculation) can be gained for both partners, if you concentrate on pleasuring your lover. Step back from your own penetration and work your magic with your hand or mouth to bring your partner to climax, or almost climax. You can then carry on after your partner is satisfied or join in just as they are about to climax.<br>  <br>  5) Circular motions. Stop overstimulating your penis head and alter your penetration technique to a circular motion so that all your penis (hence less of the head) gets stimulated.<br>  <br>  6) Location location location. Or rather position. Your partner on top reduces your movement and excitement (unlike you being on top doing all the work). This can greatly help the control you have and stimulation you receive.<br>  <br>  7) Diversionary tactics! At least for your mind anyway. No, don't think of your mother naked. Instead hold the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth. This is a simple trick, effective and unknown to your lover.<br>  <br>  8) Masturbate first. If you have been getting excited all night with your partner then the build up of anticipation is too much and will almost certainly result in premature ejaculation. Offset this by popping to the toilet and masturbating 10 minutes before you will be making your move for real.<br>  <br>  9) Stay in control. This may encompass some other aspects of these 10 tips but if you have the mindset of being in control, instead of getting over excited, then you can withdraw at any point, cchange position, give oral stimulation and generally decide the outcome of the experience.<br>  <br>  10) The 'behind the balls' muscle. Forget it's scientific name. Hold this muscle or press it with your hand when you feel the urge to come. A little practise with this technique will be an immediate relief.<br>  <br>  With these in place you will be well on your way to making a more sensual lover, a more relaxed lover, and one who is able to last longer in bed and have sex for longer until you decide your partner is sexually satisfied (well, almost!) and you are ready to join in that pleasurable sensation too.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new found control...
wBJdh6Njaa	i wouldnt go out with him lol its kind weird like if you compare it to age when you where a 8 year old playing in 3rd grade or whatever he was 18 driving and drinking hahaha|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	Maybe just go out for a date see if you do have anything in common, if you don't then you can't say you didn't at least try. If you do then you may have just found something in weirdest of places. Live is all about living so just try something new for a change :)|`|AA10415431	It sounds creepy to me. You as a student have so much other important issues to focus on. If he's an employee there may be an issue with him dating students. I would let it go and not date him. I also wouldn't put a "social class" on him. Finish school, get into your career and in your 30's start dating, you'll know yourself a lot better at that point.|`|dYN0iHvyaa	Well he's really a lot older than you. And your issue seems to be that you're not interested in him. Why would you feel like you should go out with someone you're not attracted to? If you liked him you probably wouldn't care about his age/job, or your problem would be that you like him but worry what people think or whatever. If you don't feel compelled to go out with him, then don't. You don't owe him a date or anything.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I wouldn't put too much stock in what people say. They're pretty damn quick to start talking about you no matter WHAT you do. Don't not do something because you're afraid of what someone might thing, and don't DO something because you're afraid of what someone might think. If you want to go out with him, do it. If not, don't. If he thinks poorly of you for saying no, who cares. If others think poorly of you for saying yes, who cares.
D20ue82Iaa	She likes you!  We tend to want guys to know a lot about us if we like or trust them.  Try to interject your thoughts into her long convos about herself and it might redirect the convo.  Also, a lot of girls ramble when they get nervous.  Silence often makes them feel awkward like they aren't doing something right.  Sorry we're all such a mess!!!|`|ejrxNVD1aa	lol im like that moody thats how girls are sometimes if ur girlfriend is crying give her a shoulder to cry on|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	because they have been told ever since birth, that they should be bitches. their mothers and other yenta's tell then this all their life and they pass it to their kids. a viscous circle at best......|`|WJACy1qyaa	i have no idea.

rsDtptvkaa	No I have not had my pants pulled down but I have had my skirt lifted up from behind to expose my panties on more than one occassion.  Of course most of them were when I was in junior high school.  However, as part of a soroity/fraternity initiation week thing I had my skirt lifted in the middle of campus by a guy pledging for our brother frat.  He literally ran up behind me and pulled my skirt up so high that the back came over my head leaving me quite disoriented for a few seconds which was long enough for everyone around to see I was wearing a thong. I did not think it funny at the time but now I laugh when I think about it.|`|sE2RH0A7aa	LOL. SUCKS FOR YOU.<br>  Never gotten my pants pulled down, but ripped my pants on a fence.. two days in a row.. ):
g3AM6QSVaa	First of all, I'm sorry that you are going through this. I hope all works out for you, your wife & most importantly, the baby.<br>  Bad news, you REALLY NEED a lawyer. It will cost up front but it will save you thousands in the future. If the divorce is not amicable & mutual (most aren't), then you NEED to have an attorney protecting your interests, especially since things will come up that will seem insignificant at the time, but may well hurt you in the future.<br>  To answer your question, when you get the complaint for divorce you will have a certain amount of time (usually 30 or 60 days depending on the state) to respond with your answer. This is fairly easy. What you do is go section by section and either admit or deny. For example, if it states that she wants a divorce on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty, then you would answer: On Section (the number) extreme mental cruelty, I DENY. If a section sites irreconcilable differences you could answer I ADMIT. There will be lots of sections that need to be admitted or denied. Generally, you would (obviously) ADMIT to your name, address, wedding date, number of children, etc. Being that you are against this divorce, you may want to consider denying all the rest. In an answer, you don't have to give ANY reasons whatsoever as to why you deny something. A simple DENIED is sufficient. Make sure you return the answer within the allotted period of time!<br>  As far as the third option that the attorney had given you, it was most likely to admit some & deny some. That's all you can do: admit all, deny all, or admit some/deny some.<br>  As far as your wife's reasons being untrue, that really doesn't matter now. That will only come up if you guys get to the point where your divorce needs to go to trial. That only happens in very few divorce cases. You will go to court for MANY hearings, but most likely you & your wife will eventually come up with some sort of divorce agreement without having to go trial (which the retainer averages around $10,000). Please, do yourself (and your kid) a favor, and get yourself a divorce attorney! I know you don't have the cash, but they do take credit cards.<br>  I wish you the best of luck. Stay strong.|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	All of her reasons etc., should be IN WRITING and delivered by snail mail to you via her Attorney's Office or Clerk of the Court.  I believe most all documents must be filed with the Clerk then delivered to you.  You then get with your Attorney and prepare the "Answer".<br>  If NJ is a No-Fault divorce state, she will get it granted whether you want it or not.  Find this out.  Consider the evidence and cut your losses and grief early if your Attorney doesn't think you have a better than 50/50 chance of ending this lawsuit against you.<br>  You can get a court appointed lawyer if you can prove financial hardship.|`|6afa558f5f7db4c42e087d9a9cac01b7aa	i  don't  understand   how  you  can  not  have  a lawyer  and  you  are  in the  state  of  nj..  they  have  legal  services  that  normally  take  cases of  low  income  people and  most  of  all  they  also have  a  hot line  where  you  actually  talk  to  a  lawyer and  can  ask  questions  ..  this  is  all  for  free... just  google  them   njlegal  services
5a3r0Vv7aa	Sounds to me like he is playing hard to get. The flirting with other girls in front of you sounds like he is trying to make you jealous. So just talk to him get to know each other first.|`|ApnV9ePZaa	Trying to make you jealous...|`|DdYxu5Jqaa	ah<br>  he thinks your quite which gives him th upper hand while talking to you basically givin him control of the situation<br>  second you talk it becomes a conversation and he's nervous for he could mess things up<br>  he likes you<br>  honestly the best thing to do is flat out ask the young lad<br>  " do you like me?"<br>  he won't say no<br>  if he does you can send me hate mail for the next 2 years and i will read every one, promise :)|`|qoev9aNFaa	He is sooo into you but he just dosen't know how to show it.

zAKFuGGiaa	Step means that they have no biological relationship (basically siblings by marriage). Half is when the children have one common parent...<br>  <br>  My older sister is actually my half sister (my mom, but my dad raised her since she was 2 years old...) <br>  <br>  My younger brother is my step brother (my father is married to his mother)<br>  <br>  My baby sister is also my half sister, she's my dad's daughter with his second wife...|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	You can only be step brothers if their parents got married to each other.  Like if the one boy father marries the other boys mother, then they would be step brothers.  These boys have the same father so they have half siblings.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	yep.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	No. They are half brothers. Step brothers are only related by marriage. If you had a son and married a woman with a son but you were not his father, these boys would be step brothers. Sharing a parent makes them half brothers.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Brother by another mother.<br>  <br>  LOL, yes, step brothers.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Not step brothers.  Half brothers.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	HALF BROTHERS|`|bb23d735f49c71e683de7f9e9b0b0e85aa	No they are half brothers, the only time you have "step" brother, sister, or children is when someone gets married.  For example; if you were to marry a man with a son, he would be your step son or step child, because he is not your child by blood, but in your example they are of the same blood and that makes them half brothers.|`|mAJZFmIEaa	My fiance has 3 sons with two different women. One believes our daughter is her sons half sister but the other believes that none of them are anything to her son. She knew he had 2 sons before she had a baby with him but still thinks they have no right to have anything to do with him. I was angry at first but then i thought about when he is older and his brothers and sister want to meet him she will have to explain to her son why he never knew about them and wasn't allowed to have anything to do with them. They are half siblings.. step brothers are when two people marry that have children from previous relationships and are not blood related|`|AA11122479	Actually half brothers. A step sibling occurs when two parents marry and they each have a child not from that union then the two children are step siblings. In other words if you have a child and you marry someone else who has a child then your children will be step siblings but not related by blood|`|AA11106650	They are step brothers if they dont have the same mother. I have to little brothers and we have different mothers but they are my Blood BROTHERS|`|ddP3klT3aa	Half brothers.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Yes, step brothers.|`|AA10861417	step brothers.|`|eQENZXz1aa	its a half brother ... sorta like obama is|`|tEy9hvebaa	actually half brothers.<br>  <br>  my father got married and they had my older brother.<br>  <br>  divorce...<br>  <br>  father remarried and I came along.<br>  <br>  my brother and I are half brothers (technically)<br>  <br>  step-brothers occur in blended families... she has kids, he has kids, they get married, the kids are step brothers and sisters.|`|T6HTHXbcaa	half brothers...<br>  <br>  <br>  because first son (the father pregnants first woman)<br>  <br>  and 2nd son (the father pregnants 2nd woman)<br>  <br>  then that is meaning half brothers|`|iQmj3I9Haa	Half brothers My husband has a 15yrs and a 20yr old daughter by his ex-wife and me and him have a 3 year old together. They are half brothers, not step.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Yes. My ex-husband had a son from a previous marriage, and we had two sons together. The three boys refer to each other as brothers.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Yes, they would be half brothers since they both have the same father.|`|jGCkjJjdaa	They would be half-brothers. Step-brothers are not related.|`|1vJI7VQ0aa	that is silly of course they are step brothers.|`|2keIEMFUaa	No!

AA11275104	I would just tell him straight up and that you really can't afford to be caught up in this mess and it doesn't look that great if something happens. I would just tell him that you really don't have the time and place to deal with it. If you tell him the truth her might be mad at first but then he will probably later thank you for being straight up.|`|YWaUaPaSaa	I am usually good at excuses ( ask my Mom :)) but this is tough. I know you want to help him but you don't want to get in trouble or anything. Maybe you could talk to some kind of anonomus insurance person on the phone and see if there is a way to do it legally. I see why you don't want to but also it's kind of rude not to help your friend. Tell him you don't want to take any chances and ask him about his family. Maybe he can put it under their name.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Just say no, for heaven's sake!  Why do you need to come up with an *excuse* to avoid (a) committing fraud, hello, it's a crime!! and (b) putting your insurance at risk - which by the way, will affect your credit rating and your whole ability to get loans and financing in the future?<br>  <br>  Just tell him you feel badly for him, but it is fraudulent and you cannot and will not be party to it.  And grow a spine!  Good grief!  What is wrong with you!!!??|`|w3UPO7koaa	Just nicely tell him you don't want to handle it.<br>  <br>  Obviously he can't be rightfully angry with you or offfended if you just don't feel up to doing a huge favor for him.<br>  <br>  A lot of times, making excuses is worse than lying, especially since he may ask you for another favor of this kind in the future. and if that happens, guess what? You'll be reposting this question, with a different situation.<br>  Good LUCK :D|`|dL6BcJQxaa	OMG!! Just be honest tell him the truth, why bullshit him. Tell him how u feel & how u see the situation the truth may hurt him alil but he'll get over it. TELL HIM THE TRUTH|`|za7pJkNNaa	Tell him the truth.  Exactly what you said up above.  that's what i would do|`|34vGrrVwaa	Tell him you just found out you're pregnate, and you don't know who the babby daddy is, so you'll be cancelling your insurance entirely in order to save up for paternity testing costs.<br>  <br>  Then ask him for a DNA sample.|`|9NXtWzUOaa	tell him there's a warrant out for your arrest. you are not really who you are. you have been on the lam since 1990. tell him you have NOTHING in your name. tell him not to say a word 'cause snitches end up in ditches.|`|sooxreyoaa	id be like ,im sorry no i cant do that because im struggling  also and i cant be responsible for your problems.|`|9nBa8YS0aa	tell him point blank no. let him ask another friend or family member maybe they said no that's why he ask you,you think? good luck|`|qrtHvCk4aa	Your answer to this question is in the first line of your question. He is going bankrupt. Obviously he isn't very responsible therefor the answer is NO. I can understand not wanting to hurt your friend or lose a friend over something like this, so just tell him that you have insurance points or your insurance doesn't allow someone "single" to have multiple cars on there account. Not to mention that you would have to send off for a new title for the truck so that the truck can be in your name, then you have to make sure you get all of the paper work done at the insurance agency it sounds like a huge headache, not to mention that the only way to completely protect yourself is to have full coverage on the truck so that no matter what happens its covered and that can get pricey and your not even covering yourself if someone finds out. The best answer to this is no. Sorry
crxbob5jaa	If you don't want to date this new guy, just tell him that you realize you aren't over your ex and need time to get past it. Tell him you aren't ready to start dating again. Tell him you are sorry, but you realize that you need more time. <br>  <br>  And next time.....don't date someone just because your friends mom and his mom are friends. Who cares? If you don't want to date him, don't. Just politely decline. It's done all the time.|`|4POGapREaa	Regardless of the situation with the ex, you probably shouldn't continue dating someone that you don't feel that chemistry with.  If he gets more involved in the relationship than you do, you'll just end up hurting the guy worse later on when he thinks he has something real with you.|`|KjF0p72naa	you need to be straight with him, this isnt fair to the poor kiddo.<br>  say "hey, i enjoy ___ about dating you but having just gotten out of a relationship, i wanted to make the effort with you, but im not ready yet. i think you should be free to date other people and i need to take some time just for me." something like that and nothing to the effect of you still having feelings for the last guy. nothing!<br>  hope it goes well, just dont keep this one, itll only make things worse the longer you wai.t|`|pVgWZG7jaa	Break up with him....who cares what people think of you!  You and the people close to you know who the real you are!  I would tell him the truth...that you still have feelings for your ex.....and you feel like those feelings may get in the way of being a good girlfriend to him!  He would respect you more if you were honest....otherwise he would think you are immature!

Just like the others said, go a few days and it'll happen. But if you're enjoying the sex and everything that is going on with your relationship then don't worry about it. But if you're like me and you know you're going to worry about it, consider going to the doctor. They can suggest a bunch of different fun things to experiment with like arousing gel and stuff like that. Just look around in the sex section of your Wal-Mart or Rite Aid. I'm sure you'll find something. Good luck!!|`|b60a7cac55e2e3c6b01466b293550026aa	Maybe you are just getting laid to often.  Cry me a river!  Try being on a dry spell for once and not spreading your legs all the time then maybe your loins will moisten up a bit by the thought of sex.  Your problem is that you do not have a problem.  If I had a billion dollars, I would not have think about money.  Enjoy what you got and come up with a real problem.|`|vS3Zbh5Daa	It doesnt happen often, well... not for most women. But it could be that your never turned on before sex. You might not have any felling for the guy your having sex with. It doesnt have to do with how your body functions, it has to do with how your brain and sences function. Im an extremely educated doctor, so believe me.|`|g6p6PXfvaa	Well, I don't know that I would define horny as tingling genitals.

4xDMHy3laa	Always notice the eyes first.

kGBli717aa	Yes, they are able to decide; the courts give the teen's rights much consideration. See link below, very helpful.
X4i2jej5aa	I think you should talk to your grandma about calling the police. I know its a scary thing to do, and there are many risks to take. But for your cousin's sake, you can't let him stay in an abusive family. If this continues any longer, he may have a very horrible time when he gets older. Since he is still young, try to fix as much as you can. Call the police, tell them what's going on and they will get to the bottom of everything. If his father won't do anything, then your grandmother will.<br>  Good-Luck!|`|NuvKPl3naa	you need to call child protective services. you dont have to give your name. take pictures and or take him to the police or dr. your grandma may be able to care for him if she comes forward so he wont have to go to a foster home. good luck

Maybe its what you do and not what you say that affect their outlook on you.|`|pfmkJmcwaa	Some people can be real jerks.

He'd tag along with you when you went shopping, stop by your place for a movie when you were lonely but didn't feel like going out, or even sit there and hold you while you sobbed and told him about how horribly the (other) guy that you were f***ing treated you.<br>  <br>  At the time, you probably joked with your girlfriends about how he was a little puppy dog, always following you around, trying to do things to get you to pay attention to him. They probably teased you because they thought he had a crush on you. Given that his behavior was, admittedly, a little pathetic, you vehemently denied having any romantic feelings for him, and buttressed your position by claiming that you were "just friends." Besides, he totally wasn't your type. I mean, he was a little too short, or too bald, or too fat, or too poor, or didn't know how to dress himself, or basically be or do any of the things that your tall, good-looking, fit, rich, stylish boyfriend at the time pulled off with such ease.<br>  <br>  Eventually, your Platonic buddy drifted away, as your relationship with the boyfriend got more serious and spending time with this other guy was, admittedly, a little weird, if you weren't dating him. More time passed, and the boyfriend eventually cheated on you, or became boring, or you realized that the things that attracted you to him weren't the kinds of things that make for a good, long-term relationship. So, now, you're single again, and after having tried the bar scene for several months having only encountered players and douche bags, you wonder, "What happened to all the nice guys?"<br>  <br>  Well, once again, you did.<br>  <br>  You ignored the nice guy. You used him for emotional intimacy without reciprocating, in kind, with physical intimacy. You laughed at his consideration and resented his devotion. You valued the aloof boyfriend more than the attentive "just-a-" friend. Eventually, he took the hint and moved on with his life. He probably came to realize, one day, that women aren't really attracted to guys who hold doors open; or make dinners just because; or buy you a Christmas gift that you mentioned, in passing, that you really wanted five months ago; or listen when you're upset; or hold you when you cry. He came to realize that, if he wanted a woman like you, he'd have to act more like the boyfriend that you had. He probably cleaned up his look, started making some money, and generally acted like more of an asshole than he ever wanted to be.<br>  <br>  Fact is, now, he's probably getting laid, and in a way, your ultimate rejection of him is to thank for that. And I'm sorry that it took the complete absence of "nice guys" in your life for you to realize that you missed them and wanted them. Most women will only have a handful of nice guys stumble into their lives, if that.<br>  <br>  So, if you're looking for a nice guy, here's what you do:<br>  <br>  1.) Build a time machine.<br>  <br>  2.) Go back a few years and pull your head out of your ***.<br>  <br>  3.) Take a look at what's right in front of you and grab a hold of it.<br>  <br>  I suppose the other possibility is that you STILL don't really want a nice guy, but you feel the social pressure to at least appear to have matured beyond your infantile taste in men. In which case, you might be in luck, because the nice guy you claim to want has, in reality, shed his nice guy mantle and is out there looking to unleash his cynicism and resentment onto someone just like you.<br>  <br>  If you were five years younger.<br>  <br>  So, please: either stop misrepresenting what you want, or own up to the fact that you've f***ed yourself over. You're getting older, after all. It's time to excise the bullshit and deal with reality. You didn't want a nice guy then, and he certainly doesn't want you, now.<br>  <br>  taken from <a href="http://www.girlsaskguys.com/Articles/Dating/Where-did-all-the-nice-guys-go.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.girlsaskguys.com/Articles/Dat...</a>
aeLyiRczaa	Well, I would need more information about you to a point, to know what matters to your personally.  But, as to me, this is what I looked for.<br>  <br>  A woman who was honest with herself about herself.  If she cannot be honest with her, she cannot be honest with me or others.<br>  <br>  A woman who cared about what God said and expected, and not just when his word helped her out or supported her ideal<br>  <br>  A woman who had morals and who I did not have to explain everything to.  Hey, I do not want to have to explain why she should not go to clubs with her friends.<br>  <br>  I wanted someone who would work with me to make the marriage good and not just work to get her way.<br>  <br>  I wanted someone who would realize that I had rights as the husband and the I had reasonable expectations of her in marriage.  Of course, she also has the same of me.<br>  <br>  I expected her to be able to talk with me honestly and to be logical.  In other words, life did not simply revolve around what she wanted but what was reasonable and what was in the best interest of us as a couple.<br>  <br>  I wanted someone who would never say die.  She had to rule out divorce as an option unless I cheated on her.  Of course, she also had to not give me reasonable cause to cheat, by saying no to sex all the time.<br>  <br>  Now I realize that I am not the usual person of today.

Culture are the social norms, the ethical morality, and the framework for how you view life situations. <br>  <br>  These pertain heavily to marriage.<br>  <br>  Race, on the other hand, is usually a set of genetic traits. While every man has his perferred image of beauty (generally its those he grew up with, but sometimes it is specified to a positive relationship in his past), attraction is much stronger for a man than disinterested beauty.<br>  <br>  Most men would agree, they'd take an 8 with a personality than a 10 without one.<br>  <br>  But my guess is, you're very concerned about your body image and your appearance. <br>  <br>  While there are things you can do to improve your appearance, they won't last forever and typically degenerate over the course of a lifelong relationship.<br>  <br>  Your personality, your integrity, your morals, you attitude, and your patience will win you far finer husbands that big boobs or a tight bottom. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day, men want to be married to women who:<br>  <br>  1. Love being women<br>  2. Love being married to a man.<br>  3. Love making a man, FEEL like a man.<br>  4. Love it when their man makes them FEEL like women.<br>  5. Genuinely LIKE both themselves and their man. <br>  <br>  That's really all it's about. Everything else is gravy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10495394	Race doesn't matter to me. If I ever meet a women that I love more than anything in this world I could care less about race. This person would have to be my best friend and be able to tell me anything and be honest with me.  The fact that I could meet a women and love her no matter the race would be great.

mTNe809Zaa	I've heard guys say that most of the black girls they have encountered  are bitchy and controling and so they are avoided.  Not coming from me its just a generalization that many sadly believe.  I think it really depends on the location though|`|fI2uesEwaa	You shouldn't pay attention to things like race or skin color, and neither should anybody else. Just because a guy is black, doesn't mean that he's a gangsta, or anything, and same for white guys. Just focus on what's on the inside, that's what counts.|`|TAMGy07Daa	im white, but im brazillian and im used to mixed colours, so i would date any girl i think is attractive.|`|QkkKs9Veaa	Dont be picky over what type of guy that is.

ICLekd2Vaa	did she know the father well? then let her mourn too. as they say, put on ur big girl panties and deal with it!! lol|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Okay, I have mixed emotions concerning this question.  First, if his father liked her and she was in the families lives for a period of time, then what your husband did was only polite, to announce the death.  As far as inviting, I think that is a misstatement.  I'm sure he understands your feelings and would never intentionally do something to put you at discomfort.  When he called her to advise of the death, she most likely felt it appropriate to attend the funeral and not to do it just to pi** you off.  So be an adult, just node acknowledgment and let the day pass.  I have been in your shoes and I agree it is very disturbing, but it really is not about you or her, it is about your husband and his family and the loss of a family member.  <br>  Sorry for your families loss, it seems to effect the kids more, so hold them and concentrate on their feelings.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	y would you want to kick her but if he is the one that pissed you off by inviting her??? that shows some insecurity on your part and no need for that cause he is married to you. ex did know the father so y cant she show her respect? grow up. y dont u just make sure you look like a million dollars (wearing all black) so she can know y he married you. whatever you do dont embarrass yourself and disrespect the dead..|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Why restrain yourself? Kick her butt and make sure someone is recording it. Then put it on Youtube and become an overnight sensation!<br>  <br>  <br>  I promise to say "I knew her when....."<br>  <br>  All kidding aside, sorry to hear about your loss.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	For one thing, try being the better "man", have some class and dignity.  There is nothing wrong with your husband inviting his ex to his father's funeral.  She was, after all, sharing his life when his father was alive.  I was best friends with my late husband's ex-wife, she used to come down to our house and watch chick flicks together and eat dinner together.  Everyone thought I was nuts, but, I did it to keep the peace for the sake of my husband, his children, and myself.  And over time, people began to compliment me and the fact that I was the better person.  If I were you, show, through actions, that you are the best woman for your husband.  Swallow your insecurity, hold your head up high, smile, and be genuine.  Your husband will love you forever if you did that.  And remember, this isn't about you.  It is about his fathers death....so remember that.  Don't make this about you or about his ex....Good luck|`|Ih18jMNyaa	Kill them both!  Save the trip to the funeral home since they are already there!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just kidding! Kill them both with kindness, let her know why your husband is with you and not her (because you are a better person!) by being the perfect little wife for the funeral.   Then kick his butt when you get home!|`|9tf9VF9naa	jay jay,  its your questions i look for first i open my mail.<br>  you always make me laugh. i wish i had your sense of humour. but english is not my mother tongue so sometimes i dont understand your questions.<br>  <br>  if at all you have to kick any ones butt , its your husband's. but hey on second thoughts, she has  every right to come for the funeral, jay jay. you cant deny that. <br>  <br>  any ways i know you wouldn't kick her butt and make a fool of yourself. goodluck.thanks for the laugh|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Unfortunately you need to be focusing on the circumstances that you all have to be together in. Someone has passed and you need to pay your respects not worry about silly drama. Life is fleeting.<br>  <br>  Why did he tell her to come anyhow? Was she close with his father or something? If not, that's pretty weird. he's supposed to be mourning, not finding reasons to reconnect.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Maybe you need to kick your husband's butt. And, I've never received an invitation to a funeral. You go to the ones you think you should attend.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	His ex wife has a right to attend.<br>  <br>  Why kick her butt?    Can't you do that if it's real necessary in another place.   Don't make a fool of yourself.|`|AA11683646	Take a couple of deep breaths and grit your teeth.<br>  <br>  It will be over in a short time.<br>  <br>  Hang in there.|`|mCM363I9aa	why are you angry at her? she is an EX and you are his wife now|`|T02BJJGjaa	If it really upsets you then why not kick his butt first.   There might be a good reason why he invited her, but let me remind you of something.   People don't need to be invited to a funeral.   People attend funerals to pay their respects to the person who died and the family of that person.   Show some maturity and let things be as they are.   Having an attitude about this is most inappropriate under the circumstances.|`|JPCV48hHaa	Hopefully the fact that it's a funeral and you should be respectful to your husband's family should be enough to keep you in line.  <br>  <br>  And you don't know...she may have been close to him when they were married.  You have the wedding ring, so just let it go and let her pay her respects.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Since when do we invite people to funerals?  I thought funerals were for people to come who wanted to express their sympathies to the family of the deceased, and anyone could go?  Gee, this is news to me.<br>  <br>  If you are letting your husband's ex wife control your emotions, stop it.  It's not worth the stress.  You really need to focus on your own life, not her.|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	it's not about ur husband or his ex wife. It's about his late father. Have some respect and just ignore her for one day.|`|htcfyWblaa	WHITE TRASH!|`|Zjo0ownraa	you are so funny. let her pay her last respects.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Why would you do that at your husbands fathers funeral.<br>  <br>  Thats not the time or place for fighting.|`|fGE7hL12aa	A funeral is one of those occasions where you have to rise above your feelings for each other.<br>  <br>  I know you can do it, because the whole time you are being civil on the outside, you will be planning her demise in your mind. You can kick her butt another day.
nkmwGAKjaa	I wish I could cheer you up on this one, but I am very superstitious that things always happen in 3's, good as well as not so good.

But I will think good thoughts for you!  =)|`|AA11736322	you are having intuition for something bad ....good things come in threes, too!|`|PAA4uWPuaa	I don't know if it travels in 3's, it does seem that way many times. <br>  I do know that feeling though...that something is wrong yet you don't know what exactly. <br>  Usually when I get those feelings I try to relax. I have found stressing about it never helps reveal iit any faster or in anyway that allows me to change it and generally just makes me sick.|`|98a17cb4f1cc266cc52d47121beff3c1aa	Only if your superstitious|`|75f32164f497824aa7a40d166ac823faaa	I don't know about the number, but it seems to me that all bad news come at the same time.
dspgVsUVaa	I love this idea.  You are making the big day so much more personal by only inviting a handful of guests, and by wearing something more comfortable and "casual," I think your guests notice your intent to relax the mood.  I actually wore a similar outfit to a Christmas party this year, and it was perfect.  It's classy .. go for it!|`|vf756SPraa	Wear what you want-its your day ! Feel good in what you want to wear and things will be fine|`|QdCwBSVQaa	I immediately started thinking "SWEATER DRESS" when I read your question.  If I were you, I'd go with opaque but not black tights and shoes or sandals instead of boots.  The white dress/black tight look IS very cute, but it will look very dated by next year (and you really, really don't want your wedding pix to look super dated.

SyK4GZELaa	If using your inheritance will allow you to pay for the new house in full and you have no other outstanding debt (car payments, credit cards, student loans, etc...), then yes, do it.

Get a lock box and hide the box far back in your closet. Hide the key somewhere else. Or, take just what you need for that week and hide them somewhere good and leave he rest with someone you trust.

Gay guys like having female friends & women like having male friends.  But most straight guys aren't really looking for female friends because a lot of us are high maintenance, talk too much, have too many issues, and annoy the hell out of straight men.  Our only saving grace is that men want to have sex with us so they deal with it.|`|KjF0p72naa	found one ;)<br>  but i dont know that i mind it most the time.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	1) Some women actually believe this sort of thing in the beginning, but then, a guy will only follow so long before he gets fed up and cheats.<br>  <br>  That's the consequence of not being honest and respecting each other as equals.<br>  <br>  2) Women are also more oriented to being social so they are often the ones guiding the development of the family, family structure, rules and morals etc.<br>  <br>  Those are only two basic differences in what a guy can find in a relationship.

I got my girls dresses from there and I got so aggravated with them all 4 times we were there I went to Alfred Angelo and got mine. It was here within 5 days. I ordered my girls dresses which are much more simple than mine and they aren't here yet. I ordered theirs 2 weeks before mine. That was about a month and a half ago. Plus, alfred Angelo takes you measurements and orders the Dress to fit you.I needed no sizing.|`|xJdtouK0aa	I searched the website for that dress, and nothing came up. It is possible that one of the stores has that dress. You could get lucky and the last one may be somewhere. If its not at your local store, I would definitly have them search the database because it could possibly across the country. If its THE dress, they could possibly ship it to you!. Good Luck!|`|BPNAcSpVaa	try going to the store and maybe they can special order it for you if they have none in stock.

wGyDRhT7aa	I think a lot of people think that because it's an elopement you can't wear the pretty dress and have awesome photos. I think those are the things people regret most about eloping, not having the dress, the photos or their parents. You can have all that. Your parents can come if not have someone hold cell phones with your parents on the other end, not the same thing but better than nothing. Buy a dress hire a photographer, have them shoot the wedding and then do an artistic shoot. Pick a nice vacation/elopement spot, somewhere you always wanted to go. After your done go out and eat at a nice restaurant. Hire a videographer too so they can shoot it and if you decide to you can have an informal (less expensive then a  wedding reception) party and show it and slide show of the photos after wards.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	Eloping doesn't have to be bad; you could also get your witnesses, an officiant and to go a romantic/quiet/special setting.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose, buy a special outfit - doesn't have to be a gown but should make you feel beautiful, dress up!!! Do your hair and makeup.<br>  <br>  Flowers<br>  <br>  Get pictures taken - even if you go to JC Penney's in your wedding clothes and have portraits taken.<br>  <br>  Have a reception, well a CELEBRATION is a better word - even if it's the 2 of you having a romantic dinner in a quiet little restaurant.  <br>  <br>  If you're concerned you'll regret you may want to rethink a small family back-yard type wedding?<br>  <br>  You can still plan a 'reception' when you get back home. <br>  <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, just do little things to make yourself feel special.  It's not about the big flashy ceremony - it's about spending the rest of your lives together. <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions or concerns, send me a private message!<br>  <br>  Congratulations.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	Do it in Vegas. That is the ultimate eloping spot. There is so much to do in Vegas that you'll create many memories. My boss did it about 10 years ago, she got a package and they pay her tickets to visit Vegas every anniversary. So she can go basically for free to Vegas every year. It is something that she has never regretted, She has many video tapes and pictures of the ceremony and creates new memories every year when she visits.|`|9289cdd4fa01277df2142bb4db6e0a09aa	Make it a destination wedding, like Hawaii on the beach or Bridal Veil falls in Yosemite National park, you can find a JP on the net that will assist you.|`|2M68xiN5aa	I had the same kind of issue. After looking at all the details and circumstances my fiance and I decided we will just elope. I was a little sad that I wouldn't get a real "wedding" so I started doing research. Long story short we are going to Jamacia to elope and having an acutal wedding ceremony. You can pay an extra $50 to have it video taped and have 100 video streams! (basically people you know can view it online). We are getting the platinum package that is an all inclusive wedding, flowers, dining, ceremony, cake, THE WORKS AND a super luxury honey moon suite with a private pool, hot tub, sauna, and whirlpool ( I kinda thought the private hot tub and whirl pool tub was redundant but ohwell) anyways it is the best of the best and long story short we are paying $5k for a 9 day stay and everything is included....the wedding, meals for the entire trip and fine resteraunts, scuba diving, events, sight seeing, transportation, the hotel etc etc. <br>  <br>  Here is the webpage of the company:<br>  <a href="http://www.sandals.com/general/resorts-jamaica.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandals.com/general/resorts-j...</a>|`|4POGapREaa	We did that & I don't regret it at all.  We planned the big wedding & canceled it which was the best decision we ever made.  You didn't say what kind of financial situation you're working with.  Are we talking bare bones or can you go somewhere nice?  We did ours in Maui, Hawaii and it was definitely special.  It was during Sunset, our officiant was in traditional Hawaiian ceremony clothes with a head piece & everything, he did the blowing of the conch shell, his daughter (gorgeous) was our hula dancer, we exchanged flower leis, we had a photographer included in our package & our 2 friends that came with us did the video.  I kid you not, every single married person that sees our pictures says they wish they would have done the same thing.  It was just so laid back & stress free.<br>  <br>  Our whole ceremony package came out to $1,100 but we sprung for an ocean front room & a romance package too for 5 nights so with that & airfare we spent around $5,500.|`|PBdPD748aa	my fiance and i have decided to elope as well.. and there is no way we would have it any other way! what better way is there to spend your wedding day with then intimately with the one you love and will be forever with!? if you arent close with all the families then there will be nothing to regret. it is extremely difficult to pick and choose people to be there (eg your parents and not his) and not have bad or negative feelings around at the wedding. the wedding is about you both and you both only, joining 2 hearts as one and becoming each others family - why on earth would you regret spending that special day with each other intimately!? (you can always renew your vows later on). it all depends where you are going and what you are doing for your elopement. my fiance and i are eloping in a tropical rainforest and having spa treatments, a sunset cruise on a lake, professional photographers with photos on secluded beaches etc. so we are having the most intimate destination elopement we could dream of (with what we can afford, which means no honeymoon). the opportunities are endless really, just use your imagination - its all about you two!<br>  PS I am going to wear a wedding dress (Maggie Soterro)! Just because you're eloping doesnt mean the photos wont be forever!
rhvA4G4Paa	well, both my parents were into drugs from the time i can remember til the time when i was about 14<br>  <br>  it's tough, becuase you cant make someone stop doing something like that. it's their choice.<br>  <br>  all you can do is sit the person down and explain how much his/her actions are hurting you and other people, and ask the person to seek help.<br>  <br>  even that conversation takes alot of courage on your part, but it cant hurt to try(wll it can if they refuse to seek help)<br>  <br>  but yeah, good luck!|`|3ctchU2faa	I don't think you have enough experience with dealing with chronic substance abusers to help him make an informed decision. I'm not doubting your wanting to help him, but I suggest you talk to your local drug unit and to a social service worker. Because he is a substance abuser, he cannot make decisions that are beneficial to his health. I would see if you could get Social Services to help intervene and get him into a treatment center, after he has been detoxed at the hospital. <br>  At my local hospital, if someone is suspected of abusing drugs presently or in the past, they have to undergo drug screening, psychiatric evaluation, etc. and are not allowed to leave (and will be restrained) until they are agree to go a treatment center.<br>  <br>  Discuss all options with Social Services, your grandmother and your parents to see how you can all be there for you uncle as he battles his addictions.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	maybe you could talk to the people at Narcotics Anonymous and/or AA... your family needs to do an intervention... an intervention is where the family confronts the addict and lets them know that while they love him or her, they can not continue to enable them or associate with them unless they get help.  NA and AA volunteers will head up these interventions if you ask and if they have someone who can do it with your family.<br>  <br>  Your grandmother and aunt are enabling your uncle to continue his drug use by giving him a place to live and taking care of him.  He will likely die from this addiction if he does not make the choice to quit, i'm sorry to say.
rMOKjYn7aa	I moved when I was 18 and have never looked back.<br>  Your dad is probably more miserable than you (believe it or not).Happy people don't feel the need to hurt others-physically or emotionally.My dad was a miderable wretch all of his life.I actually ended up feeling sorry for him.<br>  I tell my kids that how they treat others has a direct impact on how they feel about themselves-too bad your dad hasn't learned that yet.|`|SF5WnQFQaa	JUST LIKE MY DAD! they always think their RIGHT!!

After that i understood better so maybe if you try to talk more to your dad you could help him get over whatever he's angry or stuck on? =/|`|sidUEhbjaa	I grew up in a violent home, and I really hated my Dad too. We as kids saw so much and so young, he was so self centered and macho, you know the type that the women had to cook for him and serve him, basically treated us girls like maids. I married later on, when I met a guy who is so totally different than my Dad because I didn't want to have the marriage my mother had. That being said..<br>  Its really hard to stay out of the way, when you live with someonw with an explosive personality you just never know whats gonna set them off. I would suggest to get involved with afterschool activities, listen to the radio, get your mind in other things besides your Dad and his awful behavior. Go about your buisiness and just do things that will keep you preoccupied and happy. Don't hang out with bad friends and stay out of trouble, you really don't need to give him any excuse to get after you. <br>  My Dad is in his 70's now and even though I hated him when I was young, I learned to actually love/respect him for the person he's  now. I don't really have a close relationship and I'm ok with that. I do see him and talk to him, and he's not like he used to be, he's mellowed out and I have a grown up relationship with him. <br>  You'll be out of the house soon and on your own, for now do your best and get an education so that later you can a nice life for yourself without your dad if you choose to.

What i did instead of brooding myself was to do something which i really liked to do..:painting.. I took up some painting classes, singing classes and joined gym and started trying out various face packs and stuff like that.. Those were somethings for which i didnt need anyone to be with me.. When my parents left me out of the talks, i used just greet the guests and get into my bedroom to do something which will relax my mood.. :)<br>  And when all these were done and i got bored off, I started helping my parents little by little.. I did something which i will enjoi with my parents.. like cleaning dad s table.. or having a spa day at home with my mom.. or even writing a song and giving it to my dad for his bday.. :)<br>  I think, after sometime, you wont get time for yourself.. When you have go this "me time" make full utilisation of it.. Thats what i did.. and tell you waht??? i am a good painter, i know great cooking, i can whip some awesome facial mask recipes, give mani-pedi for myself and others, have a great body and face, a good workplace, and to top that all, people have started loving me for what i have become from what i was.. Just take some courses which you like and concentrate on those and a time will come when you will defnitely be liked by others.. <br>  All the best.. Take care..! :)|`|DwBJGZt3aa	Speak out. I mean, i'm really outgoing, so I can't exactly relate to this, but try really hard to just find somewhere to jump in the conversation. Like if something good is happening in your life, such as you made try-outs or something along those lines, try to kind of brag about it but be subtle at the same time. If you know what I mean? lol..|`|WGwk1581aa	Well, you're family has no excuse to treat you that way. You should get mad at them and start crying in front of them when they do this again, and really express how it makes you feel and that it hurts that they ignore you. Because It really does hurt when someone ignores you, I know the feeling. as for your friends, well if they're doing that to you then they are not your friends, true friends do not ignore you, it sounds like your friends are a bunch of fakes and phonys. You need to try an find some friends who are real and genuine and will really treat you like a friend meaning that they will : acknowledge you, talk to you, they won't ditch you, they won't treat you bad, they will be nice to you and treat you with the same respect you give them which it sounds that you're a respectable person. So since your "so called friends" ditch you all the time just do the same thing to them, ditch them, if you keep letting them hurt you like this just because you want to remain in a "clique" then it will do more damage to you if you keep hanging out with them so, just cut them out of your life. You need to start thinking about yourself and your emotional health, and start demanding attention from you family! When my sister couldn't get attention from my parents she demanded it and they gave it to her. And if you talk to your mom again and she ignores you, then start screaming and crying so that she'll feel bad, and then tell her that it really hurts when you ignore me and you're damaging me emotionally because that's what she's doing, that's the truth. tell her how you feel!, and make her listen, don't let your family tune you out like you don't exist because you do EXIST!  Good luck :) Feel free to email me if you need to talk|`|e2d43ea7e316844655a80fb1b294f1c2aa	Well, the fact that I am crying myself to sleep for the 3rd night in a row, puts us on the same wagon :) I am 21 but sure as hell was 13... and I also have three brothers who seemed to always get attention and I was just this "shy little thing" ... hiding under my moms skirt (so to speak). You probably hear this a lot but ... 1) you wil grow out of it. Believe me. I did and so will you. Just remember DO NOT GET INTO RELATIONSHIPS with guys that have some unresolved issues. 2) If you want immidiet action - be more outspoken, laugh at jokes they say or even tell your own. Be confident and it shows. I wont tell you not to cry because I am doing it right now ... but I will tell you this ...<br>  <br>  It will get better - you will get better and you are not ugly no matter what you may think!!!!<br>  <br>  Take care and go put a smile back on your face!

77d77c87af45945f16a239d9074d004caa	There is no magic formula. Try to keep in touch when you can, even if it's just once a week. Try to talk beyond just the common "What's the weather like where you are?". Depending on how long you will be apart, you need to make sure you know whats going on with the other person on a physical and emotional level. You don't want to grow apart! You will have to trust the other person to a 100%, because all your nagging and insecurity without all the positive emotions of being with each other might put a severe strain on your relationship.<br>  <br>  It's hard, it really is.<br>  <br>  But most of all, don't listen to anyone who says that a long distance relationship is supposed to be this, or that, way. I am merely giving you tips based on what I experienced. But I think my and my boyfriends biggest problem when our relationship became long distance was that we had so different perceptions of how it had to be. When you are feeling lonely, and insecure about what goes on in their head, and they don't call (because in all fairness, the other person ahs the right to their own life, and can be too busy and tired to call every day) the fact that everyone says that you are supposed to talk everyday, or your relationship is doomed, doesn't help. You need to see what is best for you.<br>  <br>  But if you want to add that little touch to it, then do unexpected things... Like send her a postcard saying that you miss her just because, or text her something really sweet, or email her something adorable after you emailed her the sort of email she'd expect about your day/week etc, or simply tell her to get a tub of ben and jerry's look up when there is something good on the tv, tell her to sit down at a certain time with that b&j tub and tell her that you'll do the same.

You have the best relationship of your life, then it turns into a long distance relationship for about a year or so that you (or they) are away. You are faithful the whole time, despite the hardest temptation you've ever had to resist in your life, and as soon as you go back, they break up with you nonnegotiably.

That is damn near impossible to do. I had a long distance relationship with my high school sweet heart i was in the 9th gr and he was in the 11th, and he moved back to michigan. We kept in touch on and off for like 5 or 6 years! And I was young, so we were making "fake" promises of being true to each other and getting jealous. I call it fake because we bothe were seeing other people and it's not like we could stop each other. I was in Las Vegas, and he's in Detroit! But I still loved him and I needed closure because I wanted to know was it in the past or did we have a future. So in 2001, I went to see him and a lot of old feelings came back and I was almost considering moving to where he was at. But what I realized about him that when he became an adult, he was really unstable, and couldn't hold a job. And he was always talking about missing out on something so I don't think he was ready. So I never persued it. And then some years later he asked me again and I told him it wasn't going to happen. I wasn't gonna dive head first into it because I felt that he would be mooching off of me, and I can't have that off of no one. Because I basically paid for everything when I came and he didn't have a job at the time... So it was good to see him.. But I was spending my money on food and a hotel when I think he should've had that covered since my dad paid for me a ticket. I am not discouraging you.. but you need to realize that's a looooong leash to hold onto. It depends on far the distance is too. If you are close enough to make a drive in a few hours than yeah, but if it's like over a day's drive than they might as well be in Africa. And don't expect too much out of the relationship like being faithful to you, unless you're married and in the army.. any other reason it's gonna be hard.|`|AA10375363	moving closer|`|AA12037593	good luck with that dude,..i wish you the best.<br>  It can be very special,...but also very frustrating to deal with.<br>  wish i could help you on this one.........|`|b99ce69d5369aea8afd4ffeab179deb1aa	I would like to give you some.<br>  But I think that in my relationship I did everything wrong, because I am feeling like I loosing him.

Make sure it's not completely alone, because they might get worried that you'll rat them out and they might hurt you, but don't do it when you're around a lot of people. After your talk, think about it a little, because your talk should have made it easier to decide. If I were you, I'd tell them that what they did was wrong, and if they didn't turn themselves in I would tell the authorities. If they got mad, I would just say something like "I'm doing this because I care about you, and I don't want you to get hurt, and I want you to have a good life."

Here are some of the reasons why I do so.<br>  <br>  Being married is a job like other job.  In fact, it is one of the few jobs that you have to take vows or an oath in.  Now, my ex cheated on me.  So I feel that she walked off from her job or quit her job.  Regardless, I still have to pay her.<br>  <br>  Now, you can say that the money is for the kids.  Okay.  But while married, if I had gotten my butt fired for stupidity or doing wrongly, I would have not continued to get a check from the company.  This would have affected my family to include the kids.  Just because I had kids would not have made the company keep me or continue to pay me would it?<br>  <br>  In my view, my ex wife quit her job and to a point also got fired for cause.  But I still have to pay her because she has kids.  She gets to make a bad choice and still demand to be paid by me/the company.<br>  <br>  Add to the above, the fact that so much of the money that many of us pay does not get used for the kids.  We pick our kids up and still find them wearing clothing that is dirty or messed up or so forth.  But we see a new car in the driveway or hear of how the whole family went to a party or carnival or so forth.<br>  <br>  Add again, the fact that many of us go through hell to see or have much to do with our kids, no matter how current we are or how we follow the rules.<br>  <br>  Add to this the fact that when we go to court to fight the above, the female is almost always given the benefit of the doubt, no matter how much we can prove against her or how badly she acts to include in front of the kids.  Basically, the old adage that women can get by with murder is what we face if we take the mother to court.  But let us make a mistake or be late with a check, all hell breaks lose and we are threatened in many ways, to include an state issued licenses we have, which we may use to make money. <br>  <br>  Many of us try to be great husbands and great fathers.  We do what we are suppose to do and what we committed to doing and all we ever get is screwed over and still expected to pay the bills.<br>  <br>  We keep hearing women talk of how they are equal and so forth.  So if that is true, why should a woman who elects to do wrongly, not have to bear the full weight of their actions?  Hey, if they had not acted wrongly, they would still be married.  They elected to do wrong or to walk away, in many cases with little or no good reason.  So why should they not have to pay the full price for their decisions?  Again, if I mess up and get fired, I am still expected to pay my bills and most will not expect others to pay these bills for me.<br>  <br>  Now please do not tell me that it is for the kids either.  Look, if I got fired the kids would pay the price too in a way.  So when a mate messes up or does wrong, why should they not have to be held responsible.  In a way, having to pay the ex offends my morals.  For I am being forced to pay the person who did wrongly and broke their vows.  And in many cases, they did so with no legitimate reason I might add.  What does this teach the kids?  It teaches them that doing wrongly can pay off.  It helps teach the kids that doing wrongly can be rewarding and that you can use others, such as kids, to help you bilk others.<br>  <br>  These are some of the reasons many of us hate to pay child support.  We feel we are being ripped off and that the kids are being used as pawns by the ex in order to legally steal money.<br>  <br>  Most of us do love our children.  We simply get tired of having to pay people for acting badly or being irresponsible or messing up.  We feel that we are forced to do so with the kids being used as the excuse for extorting us.<br>  <br>  I have to say, if many kids today did not get child support, it might well make many marriages survive.  It might also teach kids at an earlier age that actions have consequences and also teach them that the consequences often cost others aside from just the wrong doer.  In effect, I think that many kids would learn to act better as adults if it were not for the extorting which takes place, for the kids would recall how the actions of a parent effected them.  They would be much more responsible and caring as adults because of these memories.<br>  <br>  That is my thoughts on it.|`|R15lnDZaaa	Because they do not care about their kids and they are not REAL MEN!!|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	We only hear the bad news, not the good news.

However, there is some level of mistrust that the ex spouse is actually spending the money on the children as opposed to using it for herself for something like jewelry or a tanning salon for example.  I have no problem providing for my children but hate to think I'm being duped.|`|AA10065812	???????<br>  You haven't met very many divorced and single fathers, have you?  I've met tens of thousands.<br>  <br>  According to Judge David Grey Ross, Commissioner of the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, men pay their full support in over 80% of the cases, when they are physically able to, whereas women pay in only 5% of the cases.  Being physically unable to applies in cases where he/she has been laid off, injured, disable, or killed.  Death is not a reason for not paying child support in most states.  In Missouri, the man is required to carry insurance to cover it.  Women are not.<br>  <br>  If you're wondering how some men can have really high arrears, consider a Michigan man who was in arrears of $85,000.  He got so far behind because the woman didn't tell him for 15 years that he had a daughter.  Her husband that he was the father.  He learned otherwise when he got divorced and tried for custody.  <br>  <br>  By blocking his attempt, she couldn't claim child support, so she filed against the 27 year old bio dad, and won.  Yes, if you do the math, he was 11 when she had sex with him, when she was 22.  The statute of limitations to charge her with anything had run out.<br>  <br>  So, don't make unsubstantiated assumptions.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Mebo made a very valid point.  Many dad's do not like to pay child support because have no way of knowing that the support is being used for the good of the child.  While the dad is e often force to work 2 jobs to fufill their support obligation the mother is not expected to work.  Even if the children are in school fulltime.  Obviously this means that she is using the support meant for her children to live off of.  This is just wrong.  I know there are plenty of hardworking single moms out there.  They work fulltime jobs, raise kids on their own and are lucky to see a dime of child support.  Perhaps if more women were like them men would be more willing to pay.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	I know of at least three guys who paid reliably and unstintingly.

A band-aid or other "wrapping" around the ring won't do a darn thing-- because the object that is causing the scratches is harder than gold, and therefore, certainly harder than very thin plastic wrap.<br>  <br>   In fact, on the Mineral Scale of Hardness, Gold is only a 2.5 out of 10.  Platinum is better at a 4.5.<br>  <br>  If you really don't like the scratches, you can either wear a different ring to work (a plain band, maybe) or upgrade to Platinum.<br>  <br>  Or, you can just embrace the scratches as something that's bound to happen.  For what it's worth, my father is a Lieutenant at a federal prison... his ring is very scratched as well, but he says it gives it character :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|BPNAcSpVaa	Gold is an incredibly soft metal. There is really nothing to prevent scratches on your white gold. The only thing I suggest is going to a department store and getting a cheap one to wear to work and keep your nice one for show. But you can get the ring buffed. Down the road, when you upgrade your ring, maybe get a more resilient metal, talk to a jeweler, they would be able to help you. But don't talk to any mall jeweler, they are just sales people, go to a real jeweler with credentials.|`|7t6JegEraa	It's very easy to take it to a jeweler and get the scratches buffed out. I wouldn't worry about it too much.|`|4POGapREaa	I've heard that most people just get them buffed out here & there.  Mine is white gold as well & I've noticed it's getting scratched a lot faster than my original engagement ring which was platinum.  You might want to consider an upgrade eventually.  What if you just put like a band aid on the underside of your finger with the non sticky part covering the band?  I don't know if it would stay all day but I'm just trying to help.  Best of luck.|`|bVROvLNSaa	Those are not scratches you see on your ring, it's called patina.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	A bandaid may work, but perhaps you shouldn't wear it at work if you have a job that may damage it.<br>  <br>  Patina refers to what happens to platinum. With white and yellow gold, you lose some of the metal when is scratches. Platinum just scratches and develops a "patina."|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You really can't do much because of the white gold coating, other than keep getting it redipped.<br>  Alternative is getting one in 10k yellow gold, which is very sturdy.|`|7YZ6pzZCaa	its alright, just go repolish it later on|`|6aaCfPJiaa	dont wear it

AA11984663	There are lots of people with Autism, but only 1 in 5 of the people with Autism are girls, so they will be four boys with autism interested one girl with autism.|`|cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	I hope you mean autistic and not narssisistic which means to be in love with one's self.  Anyway, while those are the people who put their needs and imagined greatness above others, -and are difficult to imagine getting along with many others; autistics are something else entirely. I won't try to describe autism because honestly I don't believe doctors can.  General psych in nursing taught us it is a broad umbrella that many sufferings get thrown under and often not even correctly. My first daughter was disagnosed as autistic and is a college grad now with 6 children...and yes, she still has problems at times but eventually met the right person and good friends. She always had loving family.  It takes time to accumulate all of those things, you don't want to rush them and settle for less than will make you happy.  They come though and the longer we wait, the better ones we find and the more we appreciate them.|`|6f43a3f19177a3e312f139ec8c26ba86aa	sorry its not me but I do havea relative w/this syndrome and she has no time or inclination for playing games, due to the high func aut. She recently had me read the book The curious incident of the dog inthe night" perhaps if you meet a nice girl you could share that book w/her to help explain how you think and function. My relative will wait unitl a very suitable marriage partner comes along, since she is very logical and scientific, she doesn't want diseases or wasted time on losers. Maybe you should consider the same, someone who shares your interests- you could find in college classes who is up to your standards and more likely to be compatible. Counseling can also help to understand yourself and how others perceive your behaviour.  Good luck...
zzaScg0haa	I would just say I'm sorry and pat him on the back
1YkSXXoQaa	you should start by driving him into town and letting him see how well you think you will do to make him feel at ease.  I live in texas and on monday night news three girls died in a car accident the driver a 16 yr old girl with a permit the mom was let drive anytime but not her dad anyway she and two friends were driving around to fast lost control and all died (which might scare your father) Or maybe not your driving but others driving.  <br>  Practice with him in town as often as you can he will eventually feel more comfortable when he sees how well you will do.<br>  You got the rest of your life to drive im sure before you know it your will be running errands in town for your parents alone
13VFSpFnaa	ok girl the first thing u have to do is talk her in a way where she doesnt feel like ur judging her. you need to ask her what is so wrong in her life that she doesnt want to live anymore. My dad killed himself long time ago when i was only 2 yrs old. I believe killing urself is not the answer. So u have to talk to her and if that does not work then contact ur closest hotline u know for suicidels..i really hope nd wish this can help you out. look al i know is that your sister is going trou some rought time that maybe she doesnt wanna talk about the problem, but u need to let her know ur there for her.<br>  muah <br>  good luck to you both<br>  =]|`|4w9gmvumaa	Tell your pareants immediately.  My cousin commmitted suicide last summer.  My life will never be the same.  It can happen in any family.  She needs help.  She may also be bulemic or anorexic, in addition to suicidal.

That tend to help the puking-bug.<br>  <br>  Try taking her some scrambled eggs and toast, stay while she eats if, and if she can't hold that down (with or without the Pepto-Bismol), you need to talk to your parents... your sister is SICK and needs medical attention.  <br>  I'm serious... she could die.|`|9FclCgcbaa	aww. she's bulimic?  ):<br>  tell someone about it?|`|Xa3btVV2aa	first inform to her parents and then try to change her mood by changing the place like going to vacation with family ...and so on

Even though you don't feel like it yet, at least give it a go.  Something like "Boy the two of us are a pair aren't we?  I think we're both PMS-ing at the same time!"  "I missed hanging out with you though.  Did something happen Friday?  I thought something was bothering you then."  Even if you might be shaking inside, act really calm and casual.  Better to do this face to face than by phone, it's harder to brush someone off or lie to them if they're standing right in front of you.  You might find out something was bothering her that made her act different, and she may have acted that way with others too.  If this happens repeatedly, though, then she may unreliable or just moody; if that's the case, I would lessen time spent with her and give that time to a friend who's more open and available to you.  Good luck.|`|3reHk4I1aa	you should call her and be all like hey i have to talk to you and then she will be all like sure and then you can say i am kindof mad about how on friday you ditched me. and i was wondering why and then so on just carry out the converstation and talk about what happened so that way you can understand why she did ditch you and then you can decide whether you still want to be mad at her|`|bFwITbGIaa	let her start first...usually i keep myself from talking to someone who made me mad...believe, if she's really your friend, she'll come to you and apologise...in time, do anything that can help you quit thinking about her|`|lKdD5Rblaa	talk to her and tell her how she made you feel; she may not be aware that she hurt you|`|9ETsVHQfaa	I have the same problem!

If she's a good friend then I think she should be able to accept your reason why you ditched her and hopefully she won't ditch you in the future.
woEoXfaZaa	First congratulations.  Even though I can understand why you are stressed it is not good for the baby so please take some deep breaths right now to bring your heart rate down a bit.<br>  <br>  Now - if I were you I would be packing my bags and letting my husband know that you are going away for a week because you want to give him some time to make up his mind on weather he wants to be with you and your child or if he wants to continue having a relationship with this nut - cause he can't have it both ways.  Don't make it into an argument - just be very matter of fact and walk out.  This should make him realise you are serious and hopefully he will cut contact.<br>  <br>  In the mean time go stay with your mum or a relative or something and relax.  Concentrate on your baby and your health.  If he doesn't break contact and come crawling back then you maybe better of with out him.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to be a family then you should try to move so she doesn't know where you live cause I wouldn't trust her to leave the baby alone once it is born.<br>  <br>  Good luck and look after yourself.|`|kMesQjEDaa	You should take it easy cause you are caring a baby.

Then you should just try to make him aware of what she's doing, not by nagging, but by maturely talking to him about it. If he's your husband, and your baby's daddy, then you shouldn't just leave like that just because times are rough. Try to work it out, but if all fails, then you should leave him and do what's best for your kid.|`|U3j7oVflaa	Tell your husband that you are absolutely tired of him disrespecting your wishes, and that when you ask for something, such as for someone to be removed from your mutually promised lives together, you expect it to happen.<br>  <br>  Let him know that continued failure and forcing you to have this person in your life will eventually result in divorce.<br>  <br>  Remind him that you could be hanging out with guys that he does not approve of or like.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, if she's saying something about a "fetus" keeping you guys together, your husband has probably confided his feelings in her, if not already cheated on you with her, and in their discussion of whether he should leave you for her or not, he probably mentioned the fact that you were having a baby together as a reason he could not bear to leave you.<br>  <br>  Basically, in shortest terms, it sounds like your guy might be a completely worthless sack, so, give him a chance to reform, and then divorce him when he fails.|`|vqEaTmU2aa	Well at first it sounded me like they were having an affair, but it sounds more to me now like he just wants to be there for her in order to guide her.

Doing things like that are illegal - if you explain the situation to the cops then they will prosecute her to the fullest extent of the law.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry you have to go through all this, especially while you are pregnant... but yes, if this girl is causing this much stress in your marriage then you need to tell your husband to cut ties with her.|`|4w9gmvumaa	You need to give him an ultimatum.  Its you and  the baby or the stalker girl.  Tell him straight up, he needs to cut ties.  You cannot be under this stress as a pregnant woman.  It can cause a miscarriage!  Nip it in the bud now, or else it's going to be worse in the long run.  If you have to leave him for a`minute to teach him a lesson, then do it.  It;s not your duty to fix that girl.  She just is obsessed with your husband.  Maybe he was more than a big bro to her and she could be so attached for that reason.  I wouldnt let her step foot in my home and let husband know it is just not acceptable.  If you have to move to a new city, then do it.  She will ruin your life and may take it out on your baby in the long run.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	Im sorry to say that he has no respect for your feelings if he is acting this way, it sounds as though he does not want to be a father.<br>  TRUST your instincts, do what you feel will be best for you. good luck.|`|eSGBXFEjaa	You should call the police and get them to handle this.<br>  <br>  Mine??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Al9nMtfPqW0GGiZtS9qFgxTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309195813AATVBLJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	an a$$hole can't.<br>  <br>  pack up honey, he's not going to change!!!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You and your husband are clearly being stalked... you two need to call the phone company and have her numbers blocked from all of your phones, including his work phone.

Not just the kinds of stuff you hear on the news, but even just people I know who mistreat their kids only because they are too selfish to think of maybe actually treating them with respect.<br>  <br>  And the only thing you can really do to your partner is to tell her to take comfort in the fact that she now has someone who loves her, and it shouldn't matter that someone in the past abandoned her like that for such selfish reasons.|`|7zXZpv8iaa	They don't care. My dad physically, emotionally, and mentally abused me for 16 years until I put a stop to it. To them, you are an extension of their life, and If you dont turn out how they want, and do what they want, they try to bend you right, and if bending doesnt work. They hammer. There is no justification for their actions. They are mentally unstable. My father was a heavy drinker, an angry drunk, a pill popper, and an abusive parent. He once assaulted a postal worker after holding him captive in his UPS van and threatening to rape his wife, he then went to jail, where he was bailed out almost instantly because hes a wealth motherf*cker. I still have extremely low self confidence, it effects my success with girls, my friendships, and just this year I became able to talk to people I didn't know without caring if they judge me. the reason they do it? Your not important. thats why, they are all that matters. All that matters is the next fix, and if your in the way you better move. My dad made me sit in a closet for 5 hours with the lights turned off because he felt I misbehaved. He beat our dog witha  Maglite flashlite when he got angry at it. He punched me in the stomach for going to see if my mom was pulling up to his house. he called me a failure, a piece of sh*t, said i wasnt worthy to be his son, told me I was a failure, a f*ck up, and that I had no future. I once had to drive the car to get us to a work party he had to go to after having my permit for 2 days on the craziest freeway in 30 miles in each direction because he was drunk and I didint want my brother and I to die.<br>  <br>  I came back to him after every single thing he put me through, like a dog. It makes me feel sick how forgiving I was.<br>  <br>  Its simple, they act like that because they feel your not important, and they run you down so you feel that way to. The only way you can get out of it is by realizing who they are. Actually...WHAT they are. And that is crazy. So. just remember, why would you care what a crazy person thinks?<br>  <br>  you wouldnt.<br>  <br>  good luck to all of you who are coming out of this like I am, im almost 18, and making headway to getting a normal level of confidence.|`|SOd54uTkaa	It's one of life's many mysteries. It sounds like your partner's mom was just scared and stupid, but the other one's are like my friend's parents, but worse. I guess they just got unlucky and ended up with crappy families. I guess that all you can do is help those people, like your partner, and show them that there is love in the world and that you are there to offer it.|`|Xwz8Z0diaa	Oh man, I am sorry. I do not know why parents treat their children so ill-mannerly, but I guess, it might be because of tradition (i.e. their parents treated them that way). I have never been mistreated by either of my parents, but many of my friends have been in abusive (though not serious as others) situations. I am also not a parent, but if I ever had a child, I would most certainly not treat him or her that way. <br>  <br>  Additionally, I think it is a question of negligence, for example, a father or mother may want to support their child, but partake in leaving them, because they realize that it might not be possible to raise them, so in doing so, they think their intentions are good by abandoning their child, when in reality, it is the opposite.<br>  <br>  The third reason is that the parent might be involved with alocohol, smoking (pot, marijuana, cigars/cigarettes/pipes, etc.), or any other harmful addiction.<br>  <br>  I cannot think of any more, but as for stepparents. I do not know why and I might be very wrong about this, but as far as I know, many stepparents are cruel to their step-children. I do not know why, but it might be because the stepparents are unfamiliar with the customs of the parents, it might also be because of my previous given reasons, but stepparents are another matter.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this helps, and once again, I am very sorry, my best regards.|`|hCVgzQd2aa	Hey, <br>  <br>  There are a lot of reason why parents abuse their children.  They might be trying to do what's right and go over board in punishment, they might be mentally ill, they might have been abused as a child and can't stop themselves even though they know it is wrong, they might be sadistic.  There are a lot of reasons.  None of them really matter.  The results are the same.  <br>  <br>  What can you do?  There are several things you can do.  First, encourage your partner to meet with a professional who can help her work through some of her past experiences.  Second, be available to talk with her, and more importantly, listen to her.  Make sure you have access to someone apart from your partner that can help you have support while you are supporting her.  Finally, make yourself available through intentioned communication - meaning discuss with her what is going to helpful as she comes to grips with, and heals from, her past.  She might not now at first what would be helpful, but she will eventually.  Help can range from giving space, to listening, to cooking a good meal, to just relaxing together and watching a funny movie and just forgetting for a few hours.  All of these things are important.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|vg3AV5ODaa	I believe that it has to do with a cycle in the family. Some parents had parents who did such things to them. Not only that but some parents look at children as an easy target because they arent able to do things in return and because they are their parents would think it was wrong to tell on them. Another thing is some parents lives are so miserable tht they take their anger out on their children it could be because they get attention or because they are even jealous. A child called "It" is a really good book to read. That may help out in this situation. Your best bet is to get her to open up if she hasnt already and allow her to confy to you. Show her good things and positive things and let he know it wont happen to her again.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	and unless you wake up EVERY SINGLE RELATIONSHIP you have will be the same way.<br>  <br>  some people aren't wrapped too tight, make grievous errors in judgment.|`|eSGBXFEjaa	You should comfort her and tell her that you are here for her!<br>  <br>  <br>  Mine??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Al9nMtfPqW0GGiZtS9qFgxTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309195813AATVBLJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rJu4X6MDaa	I grew up in an abuisve home, and i turned out okay... right?<br>  <br>  not really, I'm acutally a depressed misanthrope :)<br>  <br>  fake smiles make everything better!|`|A1mln67Aaa	There is no magic age where people become responsible adults capable of caring and nurturing children.    Millions of people grow to become sexually active, have children, but are emotionally children themselves and incapable of caring for their own offspring.   Life becomes a nightmare because they cant' cope with the responsibility of parenthood.     The only option they see is to abandon their children.    Or, they physically beat their children as punishment for being alive and ruining the parent's life.<br>  <br>  There is no answer here.     It is what it is.|`|U3j7oVflaa	Because they don't like their kids.  Believe it or not, it's quite possible for someone to have a child and not want it, or to absolutely hate the thing.<br>  <br>  That's why we end up with little rotting corpses in dumpsters sometimes.  That's also one of the reasons why abortions need to stay legal.<br>  <br>  In a way, it's natural, some animals will kill their young in order to get another chance to mate.  Those same animal emotions are often present in people even when not necessary.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, psychologically, these people were not fit to be parents.<br>  <br>  You would probably do well to look for a mate who is not carrying around so much emotional baggage.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VYpVrPluaa	I in no way condone abuse but these are some reasons why parents abuse their children:<br>  <br>  - They may have been abused them self as a child and see the abuse as a normal part of childhood<br>  - Mental illnesses (rarely the reason though)<br>  - Social isolation resulting in increased stress (no one there to help you through life's stresses and no one there to help the child)<br>  - Poverty or illness, again increased stress. Parent is worrying about paying bills rather than using proper guidance techiniques with their children<br>  - Drug or alcohol problems <br>  - Parent sets unattainable expections for their child and punish child when expectations are not met<br>  - Fear that they cannot take care of themselves let alone another person (reason for abandonment) and may think they're doing something beneficial for the child
AA11909552	That is *very* honorable. I can appreciate this. Sex is wayyy toooo over rated. It is alllll over the media, movies, television, etc... I'm sure you are aware that it wasn't always like this, right?<br>  The demand for sex, seems sssO open these days and it has gotten wayyy out of hand. And it is hard for me to believe how the television people, the movie people and the magazine people have let it get the way that it is. "Monkey see, monkey do", comes to mind.<br>  First of all, you do not have to do anything you do not want to do and you *certainly* should not want to be "the first" to execute THIS. Perhaps you should be "the first to be the last" on this one.<br>  Sex is something that should be very special. And a very special guy should be the one to have the "honor" to deflower a young lady.<br>  Sex is not something that should be "given away". The man has to EARN the "right of passage" and prove himself "worthy" of such an incredibly respectable thing.<br>  You can be the leader and suggest that you are going to save yourself for that special someone. Besides, that is an extremely intimate thing that no one would see, anyway. In fact, you could fib and say you DID "do it" with someone from out of town. He doesn't have a computer. So, no one can see who he is. You could even go as far as saying he is the hottest guy on the planet. Then show them a picture you took of a hot guy several miles away. (the picture has to be authentic, though. No one would believe it, if it was a jpeg, or a bitmap)<br>  I am tickled pink to have read that you are just-plain NOT ready. I absolutely respect you for this and your friends should, too. Else, they are not really your friends.<br>  I am a bit older than all of you and I can testify that you most-certainly will go through thousands of friends to find out there were only *really* a couple of them that were "true". In fact, it is HIGHLY unlikely that you will still-be-friends with even 10% of the list you have now, in the years to come. Trust me... I *know*! I am a "social butterfly" from San Diego, living near Washington DC and do not speak to *ANY* of the "best friends" I had back-in-the-day, but maybe one or two, max.<br>  (sorry this is sssO long... I was just/only *SUPER* impressed with your last sentence)<br>  Good luck!
4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	I know it hurts! I'm very sorry to hear about your break-up. All things happen for a reason and like you said you may end up together again. If it's meant to be it will happen, you can not force it. This is a time for you to grow personally and emotionally. Work on yourself and everything will fall into place in due time.|`|BY02DhfWaa	you know what i think you should give him the time he needs , if he says that you might get back together don't pressure him that will just make him move farther away .you will maybe be in the same school in the fall so just be friends for now and if you both really love each other as much as you say you do it will work out okay .take this time to concentrate on school and make some friends i think you will get back together .|`|ubofHDxPaa	If he's not that interested in you, then you need to move on. You are not being honest to yourself.  He probably doesn't want to really hurt you but if you won't accept reality, he probably will hurt you really bad.|`|abTZX46faa	FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT!|`|affb62fc89aec6d30cc223d30648b80daa	Long distance relationships are the hardest to maintain, no matter how close a couple is. From your own admission, you've spent more time apart then you have together. He may love you and you may love him, but distance is often a killer, even in the strongest of relationships. People simply get lonely. <br>  <br>  As for being devastated, it is still too fresh. The best thing to do is to cut contact off completely. If you feel lonely, join a group. Like to read?  Join a book club. Like to sew or knit? Plenty of groups out there for that type of thing. Enjoy the great outdoors? I personally am involved with a hiking group and a rock-climbing group. Play music? Start a band, even if you never intend to play live. <br>  <br>  The point is, get out and meet people! Cultivate your own life. Make friends. You will naturally become more interesting to another person when you know who you are and what you like. No one is responsible for your happiness but yourself and I mean no one. Placing that pressure on someone who doesn't want is a sure way to make someone lose interest in you.  And who knows, you may even become more interesting to him if you have a life apart from him, should your paths cross again. <br>  <br>  Get real. Cut off contact for a while. Get a life of your own. Call him out of the blue and tell him what you've been up to, how much you've learned about yourself. And you'll either get him back or you won't, but at that point, you won't care. Nothing is more attractive than a person who knows themselves and has the confidence to be who they are. <br>  <br>  And by all means, feel sad and all that. It is natural. But don't make yourself into an "oh, woe as me" loser.|`|gtTg0XOOaa	Set your sights on the fall when you'll see him again. Continue drawing strength form your telephone conversations with him and let him now how much you appreciate him being there fore you. The fact is that long distance ones are extremely trying even to the strongest of couples. It's very hard, I know, but prepare yourself for the possibility of not being with him even when you return. In the meantime, you really should be asking him what he's been doing to help pass the time. Has he gotten a new hobby or met some new people? And then try the same. While your relationship has ended, it's very clear your friendship has stayed intact. Good luck to you.|`|rhreN8wbaa	I think you should just continue doing what you're doing and talk to him on the phone but don't say anything too pushy like " i miss you everyday, I want to be with you still." and don't ask him about other girls or anything cause that would be a turn off to him and it might make him think you're crazy. When he comes back the feeling he once had will probably still be there after he can see you in person as long as you don't push him away by moaning and crying and making yourself look pathetic. <br>  Trust me, no matter what you don't ever mention anything about missing him or wanting to get back together or anything about if he's seeing other girls. You will know he really cares if he still loves you when he comes back.|`|P5M76mwzaa	you should just move on ok when u go to the same school in the fall he  might meet a other girl at your school and it will brake your heart if u really still love him|`|6EI7Hjzmaa	Well i JUST went through the EXACT same situation... my boyfriend broke up w/ me bc he didn't feel the same like he did before... he said it wasn't me and it would be unfair for him to pretend... i cried he cried.. and it was two weeks before our anniversary on valentines day!! =( and i also still talk to him a bc i don't have too many friends at my school and he said "well you never know thing might change for us"... but actually recently i got mad because he said he would talk to me b4 i left for a weekend and he didn't so i didn't talk to him for a week and his life went down the gutter in an instant... he almost slept with an old friend of his and messed around with another girl... we got really close while and so i talk to him about everything so i helped him through all of that and he is doing SOOO much better!!<br>  <br>  i think if you keep in contact with him and see what happens!! Im just glad i have him and that i can help him like i have!|`|AA10990828	First make yourself busy both of you guys do care for each other and you are doing the normal thing.  There could be two reasons why he broke it off and i think you know them both.  You will eventually get over it and so will he probably sooner than you. Men are good at that especially if he has friends or someone to keep his mind off the breakup so i suggest you do the same. By all means don't try to get back together it will make things worst. Try to move on as best you can, and again MAKE yourself busy. At this point you both are using each other as a security blanket not allowing each other to move on. Look at it this way its like weening a baby off a pacifier.  You will be fine and so will he. Find a hobby or exercise join a club and remember he broke up with you, so actually he has you holding on be careful about this. Good luck|`|AA11296241	He may be saying those things coz you probably bawl everytime you guys talk. I know how you feel - I have been there many times myself. All I can say is, if teh guy tells you - even once - that he is out of love with you - honey there is nothing you can do. And honestly, I am not sure if tryign to get him back should be your focus. I knwo it hurts now. and seeing this msg probably hurts even more... try not to talk to him for a week. It will be tough - but give it a try - if he is the first one to call after a week - maybe you guys have a chance. If he doesnt, you have your answer. Good Luck...|`|BUpcsIGfaa	ok you dont want to get him back cos that wont help a thing.  just maybe lay off calling every day maybe every other day or every day every now and then cos if he needs some space and you dont allow it then the chances are you wont get back together.  give him a bit of time and space and see how that affects things.<br>  <br>  he clearly still loves you cos otherwise no guys in this day and age still wants to stay in contact with you otherwise.  you need to try and make some girl friends at your colllege so that it helps you take your mind off of him for that time when your having fun.<br>  <br>  when i broke up with my ex i had no choice but to stay in bed cos i got real bad tonsillitis and that extended the period of getting over him to around 3 months but i did and now we can talk and have conversations, we didnt get back together but we both found other people.<br>  <br>  im not sure how old you are but never forget that no matter how much you love someone you have to think of whats best for yourself, spend some time with friends and try not to talk to him too much as you will just want him more and more and may end up getting your hopes up for nothing.<br>  <br>  i really hope things work out for the best, good luck!!|`|CiYCSzufaa	hmm...sorry about your break up. long distant relationships are always gonna be hard, but i think if yout both keep talking to each other, maybe even "run into him" when you go back home, (or wherever he lives,) you two will be back together, its just a matter of time. <br>  <br>  but if you end all ties with him, he might either be very upset with you, or he might realize, okay this is too much, it hurts not being able to be with her. <br>  <br>  so i just think its a matter of time. me and my boyfriend broke up for stupid reasons (after a year) and we ended up back together.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this helps (:|`|kiY9kihbaa	I know how much you need him, but the truth is he won't be that person for you anymore.  Pursuing him will only lead to your heartache.  It seems like he is the only one who can make you feel that happy again and maybe for the time being he is.  In a few months you should be able to go out and find someone who can be that person for you again. <br>  <br>  Talking to him once a day is great, as long as you don't get hung up on him.  Use those talks as support, reconcile with yourself that it'll never be more than that, and find something else that demands your attention for the time being.<br>  <br>  And no, you will not get back together like you were before.  The moment a guy has doubts about his relationship to the point that he cuts it off, there is no way he'll feel love for you again in the same way.  Getting dumped is one of the hardest experiences to go through in life, so be proud of yourself for being strong.  Try not to be bitter.  If you need to cry, try to in private.  When you leave your house, close your mind to those negative thoughts.  If the phone calls get to difficult to take (and they might), tell him you need time away and cut off all communication with him.  Once you settle down, you could get back in touch (if you are sure of yourself).  <br>  <br>  I'm pulling for you:)|`|wHgBnMipaa	You may not want to hear it, but you really need to stand up on your own two feet right now.  If he isn't interested in you, you aren't going to feel any better pining over him.  Save yourself more heartbreak and move on.  Join some clubs at your college or something of that sort.  Just get involved and get to know new people so that you'll be busy and you won't feel like you need him so much.  Eventually, you'll find someone else.|`|T9KmnUUbaa	well to start out,,, another person doesn't make you happy, thats got to come from within yourself.. they say (a book i once ready said) give him 8 weeks if his still calling within that time you still have a chance, but 8 weeks and no phone call he's really gone|`|fI2uesEwaa	Maybe over spring break, you two should meet somewhere, and work it out.

If he gets back with you it's probably going to be because he feels bad or he is trying to see if the love will come back...you don't fall out of love overnight, and who wants a relationship like that?... If you let him go things will be better, he will either come back or another guy will sweep you off your feet..Good Luck with everything...if you need anymore advice I will be more than welcome to help!|`|5RUnWnf2aa	I'm sorry your going threw this...  It does hurt and there is no great advice that will take that away.  Your both growing and learning, relationships are apart of that learning.  To be honest 'you need to stop the communication' go threw the pain and then after the dust has settled see what is left.  Don't make mistakes you can't take back while you go silent.

It takes a lot of time and effort to keep everything going smoothly. I guess all I can say to give you maybe a thought of what your boyfriend is thinking is that this is a time of a lot of growing, changing, and thinking, and maybe your boyfriend does just need some alone time to figure out where everything is headed. I don't know if you will or won't get back together, but you should take this time as well to evaluate your life, the relationship, and determine what exactly it is your are looking for.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|lzDkVAYraa	I've had lots of experience with this, and if you really want him to want you back, you've got to give him his space. The minute I stopped calling and texting my boyfriend after we broke up he came running back to me! I know maybe you can't completely cut off all communication, but talk as friends and dont even mention how much you want him back. Maybe it will help! Good luck!|`|vqEaTmU2aa	I understand where you are coming from. And to be honest, there are sometimes incidents where you just shouldn't try to "get him back". Ask yourself - were you truly happy in your relationship? Apparently he wasn't, which is why he broke up with you. A relationship can only work if both parties involved are fully satisfied. Unless there is some misunderstanding, I really don't think there's much you can do. In the case that there is a misunderstanding, you should try and address it and see how things work out.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think it's a bad thing if you keep in touch with him - however, make sure your relationship does not escalate to anything further if you want to see other people (which I think you should in order for you to enjoy your life). Go out and meet other people at your college and see if you like anyone. Maybe the love of your life is somewhere out there... you will never know if you don't look.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I understand this is a very difficult time for you so I wish you nothing but the best!

But if you are looking for something more than FWBs are not for you.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	FWB are at best short-term relationships. By short-term I mean they only last a few sessions before the decision has to be made to take it further or end it. I have had one FWB relationship many years ago with someone whom I had been friends with and who was about 15 years older than me. We had a platonic friendship that lasted a few years until she married and we then lost contact for a while until contacted me again once she separated from her husband. It was during her separation from her husband that the FWB developed. The FWB worked for a while but she was wanting more from the relationship and I told her no. Once I said no the FWB ended. <br>  <br>  Looking back I wonder if her problem marriage made her feel as though she was missing something and if the FWB was a way for her to start something that she regretted not starting earlier? Unfortunately once the FWB started we were in two very different parts in our lives and my priorities had changed where FWB was the only thing I was wanting. <br>  <br>  Would I recommend FWB relationship? It would depend on what you were wanting and what your expectations were. If you are wanting FWB relationship then you should be prepared to accept that most likely it will not last long and most likely there will be conflict over where the relationship is going. If you can be pragmatic about it as a solution to meet a short-term need then great but if you are looking at it from 'rose-colored glasses' believing you are going to have the best of both worlds then you are most likely kidding yourself.<br>  <br>  If was not married now, would I have another FWB relationship? Probably not as it was a good experience to have once but the relationship issues that it brings can be a bit too much.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I had an old boyfriend come back into my life, we did not have the "love" connection so we went with FWB.

Go ahead and pierce your ears until there's no more room but think twice, three times - or more before doing the nose, tongue or the other parts of your body (I won't go into all the parts that can be pierced).<br>  The sad truth is that having the facial piercings can stop you from getting a good paying job. Plus: There's infections, speech impediments, accidental ripping due to many different outside causes. Giving the wrong impression to some people ... the list goes on.<br>  Find other ways to express your individuality that will not be permanent. (Example: Hair, clothes, makeup, jewelry... etc.).<br>  <br>  Wishing you the wisdom to see the future and make the right choices for yourself.|`|1YkSXXoQaa	I believe Spencers has some try that but if your parents don't want you to get one not much you can do but wait til your 18 to get it onyour own.

Its possible to love more than one person at a time, and there are different types of love.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Why aren't they remarrying the one they love? <br>  <br>  Reasons why people marry other than love: convenience-they can still share responsibilities, finances, parenting etc., health insurance, companionship, citizenship.|`|2nPwq257aa	1) finances<br>  2) food<br>  3) shelter<br>  4) sex<br>  5) money<br>  6) money<br>  7) possible social acceptance (especially if children are involved)|`|wzqahEqiaa	I wouldn't get married if I was in love with someone else.

mOnQhMy2aa	well judging from your picture they are preppy schoolgirls who arent having fun gettting raped in the *** by their stepdads anymore so the see you and your friends and decided to try and have some fun and try to piss you off. stupid girls do that a lot.  my advice would be to A: Ignore them completely, B: KIck Their Asses, C:Learn some Latin and the next time they come near you start chanting latin and pointing at them just to see what happens|`|FE1jyfRSaa	They like you. :)|`|EHaWoepRaa	they want you to hang with them|`|g7T5jox1aa	It all depends on what grade you guys are all in??|`|u1TIklpPaa	umm well...talk to them about it. ask questions they probably think their friends with you and your people|`|6FZABlAhaa	r they gay?
289ccf15e18e573af11aa60d253dc3bfaa	The best thing for you to do is just be there for your friend.<br>  Let them talk and just listen.<br>  Your friend has a lot of memories about their dad and is going to want to talk.<br>  Don't interrupt or compare, Just listen.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Uhm, well I don't think sheering them would help at all. <br>  <br>  But you could always take them out somewhere to get their mind off of it. You have to give them time to vent and to feel depressed. It might sound like the wrong thing but if they dont vent now it could come back worse latter.|`|BcSAVZ7Daa	well i agree sheering him is not a good idea. <br>  um.i'm pretty sure there's no real way to cheer him up<br>  but u can help him move on by just being there like just there if he needs tio talk about it then yeah you will. but also treat him as a friend hang out do normal things that help show him that he can move on.<br>  read this in a book sumwhere

4y2W5fJjaa	SOUNDS LIKE HE IS OK.HE SPENDS TIME WITH YOU , WORK, CARS. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM JOIN HIM WHEN HE IS WORKING ON THE CAR. WOMEN NEED TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND BE MORE AGGRESSIVE.|`|N7gOE1btaa	If he didn't see you because he was working alot then thats understandable.  But if he isn't seeing you because of his hobby after work, then that is wrong.  You have no reason to not trust him, but you have reason to question his feelings for you.  He is likely not a good guy if he does this.  I understand if you live far apart and he is too tired to travel to see you, but I doubt thats the case.  I think its time to drop this one and give your time to someone who is willing to give you his time.|`|aMWpjYBBaa	Your not being dumb. you just don't know...i wish you would have told us how long you have been dating.  Well, being a dude, the only thing i can say right now is trust him...but if you get any of the following, you should be suspicious of him messing with other chicks:  <br>  <br>  1. He doesn't return your phone calls or calls you back at the end of the day late at night.<br>  <br>  2.  Goes out around the time you usual hang together<br>  <br>  3. Always gone, all of a sudden.<br>  <br>  4.Starts talking about you breaking up with him over him not having time for you. [this is a mind game to find out if you are messing around him. by you sayin that your not cheating is self gratification on him not being caught doin what he does, to put you in a false state of assurance]<br>  <br>  I mean, if you really wanna know was good with him, one thing that will hemme it all up is, to sneak away his cell phone and look at his text messages...if you don't see anything, it could be all good...but 9 times out of 10...text messages from chicks will get a dude caught up!

2JUQYLCGaa	Well first of all.<br>  I didn't even have to read the long explanation to figure out if you liked this boy.<br>  (Just for the record though, I did read it. ;] )<br>  <br>  If you just loved him as a friend then you wouldn't even have to ask.<br>  Seriously.<br>  <br>  I have had some best guy friends I've had for YEARS, like over five years each and they are ATTRACTIVE as FFFF!!! And I love them with all my heart. I went to one of their weddings and was happy for them and everything.<br>  <br>  The thing is, even if you don't LOVE him you definitely LIKE your friend.<br>  <br>  It could be a passing infatuation with him though.<br>  Or it could also be a longterm feeling of love. ;]<br>  <br>  It depends.<br>  If you dated him then you'd know in the long run how you felt.<br>  <br>  OH AND ...<br>  It really already sounds like this guy likes you. Boys usually don't talk on the phone and hang out with a girl all day unless they have some sort of feelings for him.<br>  <br>  This is what you do.<br>  Casually, not all girlishly shy and awkardly, but CASUALLY as a friend and the way you normally talk to him,<br>  <br>  ask him, "How do you feel about me?"<br>  And tell him the truth.|`|HReDTDExaa	best friend love means you'd do anything and ya'll r just cool & everything. but love love means that u get this crazy feeling in your stomach when he comes around or you talk to him. its like you could just float away when you're around him. how do you feel when you're aroun him?|`|fYppLGkXaa	This should help|`|iKjRrcDoaa	well... best friend love is when you have a friend and you hug a lot. Boyfriend love is when you think you want to kiss him. i hope this info. works|`|pfmkJmcwaa	It would be very easy to tell if it's best friend love or boyfriend love. <br>  Do you think about him romantically? If yes, then it's boyfriend love. If no, then it's friend love.|`|hKd21emDaa	Do you feel different around him than when ur with your girlfriends? Can you look him in the eye? Do you catch yourself looking at him at odd times?|`|4qwIPhfOaa	well i think that u should go to the movies or bowling and see if u would concider it a date or fun with a bud|`|nPSqX7Paaa	I read all the question you made and the additional comments you posted. In love, there is not such thing as age. ;)<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, you like him as a best best friend as he likes you. I will explain. The reason for this is that you need him but you do not want him. People need other people for the simple reason of feeling better, feeling safe, feeling good about yourself as much as he feels around you. That special magic thing you two have is just great, but remember what you said: "You love him and that you are inseparable" that is only true friendship. Being in love with your best friend is not bad at all, if you still have that magic thing through high school and college than be boyfriend and girlfriend in the near future. You were meant to be, but be wise of deciding if you really want to be with him forever, may this decission be involved by THE TWO OF YOU.<br>  <br>  If for any reason you are not for each other or not meant to be, do not surrender, for life is short and can be changed in to something amazing in a blink of an eye. Love is forever, life is for a period of time.<br>  It takes a second to meet a person.<br>  A minute to know that person.<br>  An hour to be friends.<br>  A day to forgive... and a life time to forget.<br>  Have patience, and give time to time.<br>  Good luck, darling.<br>  Take care and be safe.<br>  Cheers.|`|rHENEJYWaa	Tell him how you feel.  If he is really a friend he'll tell you the truth.  If you keep it inside you won't ever know, no matter how many people answer this post.<br>  <br>  It has been my experience that if a guy or girl doesn't express attraction by kissing or holding hands it's because they aren't interested in you that way.  Most people connect right away whether they get physical or not.<br>  <br>  That being said he may love you completely and you are both too shy to say something.  You do it.|`|rPKk1jV9aa	ask him out and im not  reasing it|`|vSSuuTcFaa	okay.. feeling love for your best friend is not uncommon.. it's like.. how can you ignore the fact that you both are opposite sexes right? there is always an underlying sexual current to consider. if it's really driving you mad.. maybe you could just tell him! i mean.. if you really are best friends.. you could say to him that you've got something to confess: that you're having "thoughts" about him.. that you think you might like him as more than just a friend. it would help if he wasn't already dating someone else though. if he isn't.. he might be flattered.. don't expect him to confess a burning love for you immediately (although it would be great if he did) .. but just let him think about it. he might realise he has a thing for you too. openness is the key to a great friend-love relationship. use what you two have: you both are FRIENDS.|`|1hciyvKdaa	It doesnt matter if you love this person, it matters if they take the time to get to know you and ask you out. You can swear all day here that you loooooooooove someone, doesnt matter at all, its the guy asking you out. If you are too smitten and out of control the person will be taken back by that, if you ask them out, thats not a good thing too. Men chase women. Im not reading the original post. <br>  You are sounding smitten. Having a friend is one thing, the feelign for your best girl friend would be no dif than a guy friend ok. Its the oh my god its out of control how I like this person, thats a crush. Crushes are only fun if you contain yourself. Letting him know you have a crush can turn very embarrassing for you if hes not interested. I hope some of this was at least towards your long question.

WYEWzuvQaa	try cleaning up the apartment this time around, don't mind the pain of having to do all by your self. then lay down the rules, put it in black and white what his responsibilities are as your husband. let him know that his laziness are no longer tolerated, spell every thing out to the letter show him what and how you want the apartment to be taken care of. let him commit to a routine cleaning may be every weekend or depending on how your family schedule is. tell him he need to change and lead a more clean and healthy life and if you guys have kids, let him know it's bad for them to adopt to such habit since it's not a good  example. get him to keep his clean cloths on the hanger and the dirty ones in a bag or laundry room where he will attend to them. get money from him or go out shopping with him for under wears and thing that You thinks he need to start off. you know him better just with your support he can be as clean as you want it. don't ridicule him over all this, i know it's not easy to ignore such attitude but constantly watching out for loop hole and reminding him of the clean up routine will help put him on track. also try to work together with him when ever you can so that he doesn't see it as been compelling, get him to like doing the dishes by maybe staying to  chat with him while he is at it, i mean practically how you will put a little boy through doing the house chores. good luck.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Ew. He sounds gross. Try calling Mary Poppins?|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I hope you don't catch fleas!! Really. Does he talk to himself or imaginary friends too?|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	Because you allow him to be.  Nothing will ever, ever change unless you make it change.  I would also guess that he probably grew up with everything being done for him.  His behavior is unacceptable but there are those few women who put up with men like this.  <br>  <br>  Your husband behaves like a child, but even worse, you are in a marriage where everything takes work, by both spouses.  And he's not doing any of the basic things which just need to be done.  Something is off here....he either feels he shouldn't have to do it, or, he is so used to not giving in and letting you get fed up to the point where you can't take it anymore.  What, oh what would he do, if he lived by himself???  Have you asked yourself that question yet???<br>  <br>  I just wonder, though, does he behave like this at his job?? In other words, does he actually pick up after himself, does his workplace look like it's cleaned up?  Have you heard any of his co-workers comlain that he's a slob??  Time for you to do some spying, my friend.  Because if you find out that he doesn't behave this way at work, there you go...he's behaving like a spoiled brat and taking full advantage of you.  And if he is......<br>  <br>  Yes, you can move out, why not???  Just because he's your husband?  Well, how much longer are you going to take this cr*p?? Honey, no woman in her right mind would live under these circumstances.  You are not a wife, you are a maid, and nothing more.  It's your choice.....|`|EMKuBql8aa	He sounds depressed. Normal people don't just wear dirty clothes like that. I say take him to a DR, something doesn't sound right.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Because you're letting him be lazy|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	tell him it's due or die|`|1hDhmql4aa	Does he suffer from depression or did he come from a family where the mother did everything for him?<br>  When it comes to the dishes you could put all extra cups,plates, bowls and cutlery away into boxes or just throw them away.  One plate for each person in the house hold and hide a few things for when visitors come to dinner.  It doesn't stop him from not washing up after himself but he can only make a small mess and also will run out of plates to eat with!!!<br>  Same with towels!<br>  Then you have to create a system that makes it's as simple as possible of cleaning up, even design a cleaning roster (a simple one), so that he has no excuse not to do his share. When he doesn't do this then tell him what the consequences will be if he doesn't do it!<br>  Consequences may be as simple as throwing out cloths that you think he doesn't need anymore, making him pay for a cleaner to come in regularly and clean up his mess or if he is depressed getting him to seek counseling to help him get his motivation back!  If it is depression then he will need a lot of love and support!|`|gk1AXMRvaa	How can you sleep with a man that don't wash that's nasty. on the other hand take all his stuff and put in a bag on his side of the bed and buy paper products if yall don't like washing dishes|`|O4qO8aoLaa	Depends.  We kind of need more information.  Does he work?  Do you work?  If you both work, you both need to share the responsibility.  If only 1 of you does the person that stays home should do it.|`|9193c72486d5da8c93f07d053e4be3b2aa	Yikes,<br>  I would quit waiting for him to do it. Tell him what needs to be done. He definitely needs to wear underwear and change his pants. Gross!!!!!!!!!|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	If he's that bad, you can only move out or put up with it.|`|okjuXjrKaa	Don't give him any?|`|VQtKujZoaa	sounds like my boyfriend. he needs to grow up
2tJF8J4Paa	It doesn't seem like you did anything wrong.  Maybe the girl likes or liked you too and she feels uncomfortable being around you.  Just give her time and keep trying to talk to her.  If she's mature enough she'll start talking to you again.|`|l6jhqA8laa	Oh well hmm...<br>  I did do that to a guy. He likes me. I don't! I don't like him.I hate him. Sorry hate is just such a strong word. :/ girls just sometimes hate guys that like them. <br>  Us gurls r confusing :)|`|3reHk4I1aa	i thinkl the girl really is kindof bipolar first she likes you then she is mad at you and its the sam ecycle all over again and you should confront her and say hey i have noticed that you are mad at me and i know you probaly dont want to talk to me but iwas wondering if you could take like 10 seconds out of your life to tell me why you are mad at me and if she doesnt well then thats a loss she doesnt get to see how great of a friend you really are
i6Ix28IPaa	"The two shall be come one."  That includes sharing passwords.  In fact, my husband and I share only a single MySpace page--primarily to keep in touch with family members.<br>  <br>  Your husband needs to realize that he's not single anymore and learn to protect the relationhip he's chosen to have with you.  If he's doing anything that he can't or won't share with you, I'd be worried, too!  I suppose that he's afraid to completely let go of his life as a bachelor.  For whatever reason, he's not fully yours or 100% vested in the relationship.<br>  <br>  He may view the situation as you checking up on him, being his mother or his warden, etc., but he knows your passwords, right?  This should be viewed it as you two keeping each other accountable and protecting your relationship from the dangers of the internet--and there are plenty of 'em lurking out there!<br>  <br>  I'd directlyask him the $64,000 question: What is his priority? What's most important to him?  Force him to say it out loud and, if he chooses his marriage over the single life, he needs to grow a pair and act like it!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yes.  He has the right to personal space.  Either you believe him and trust him or you don't.|`|IvMPh09baa	you know what they say, if theres nothing to hide then he would hide nothing.  go with your instincts here.  don't let him blame you for his hiding things, he is acting suspicious and that why you are curious.  you have every right to know what is going on, your his wife for godsake... i hate it when men pull this whole drama crap and blame it on us... its complete bull.  i say go with your gut here, don't take no for an answer and set up some consequences for the game he's playing with you. be strong and be observant, don't let this guy fool you!<br>  <br>  this ex of his, is she revengeful?  i mean really... it takes ALOT for a woman to want that much revenge on an ex, or she might just be telling the truth and she is trying to do you a favor here.... trust your instincts!  I know us women can be bitches... but this is pretty harsh if its not true.  theres no reason to lie to you like that.|`|f6YsGOynaa	He's given you reason to distrust him, so he has no rights to privacy until he can prove to you that he's trustworthy.  <br>  <br>  I have to agree with an earlier answerer who offered up the compromise to catch him off guard one day and have him log into his email and facebook accounts so you can look around.  If he's not willing to do this, you can bet he's doing something he shouldn't be.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to check his deleted and junk folders too.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	My belief is that if you don't and can't trust someone, you shouldn't be with them.<br>  <br>  Being married doesn't mean you give up everything.  Both parties are still entitled to privacy.  But both parties also need to be loyal and also trust each other not to do the wrong thing.<br>  <br>  Pretending to be your husband and messaging girls on facebook is just plain creepy - no wonder he changed his passwords.|`|MYbRICxqaa	I feel sorry for you. Why would you even marry him if trust was an issue with you? Should you not have waited until you were more ready to give your all to him and trust him? Also, why is your husband doing on "Facebook" like that anyway? He do not have his priorities right if you ask me. Yes, you are wrong to want his passwords. But I can see your problems goes beyond some internet site. Good Luck!|`|veZLfnGFaa	Stop pushing him - if he isn't cheating, he will be soon.  People can be pushed into something because they are being accused of something that they aren't doing.  Talk to him and tell him that you don't want his passwords.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You shouldn't have done the messaging. That was wrong and you are starting trouble. But, if he has nothing to hide, there should be no reason why he can't log in, let you look, then log back out without having to give you the password. Obviously he would have to do this without warning to change what he would want to. If he really has nothing to hide, then there is no reason to hide. My passwords are all listed so that my husband can log into anything of mine any time he wants. It's also funny, but people who have nothing to hide generally never have anything that looks like something it's not.|`|04daae62adc7707fbfea4f01853f59efaa	The first answer you received was uncalled for! Anyway, I personally never wanted to have my husband’s password to everything, because I would like to think I could trust him. Then again, I always had a feeling in the back of my head, what I do not know want hurt me. He has hurt me so much until I was at a point there was no more I could bare from him hurtful or disappointing. Now we are going through a divorce, because I finally wised up and realize that Trust is everything. Without trust, there is no marriage.|`|AA10173105	nothing is going to change here, except his passwords (if he gives them to you)<br>  you have had problems in the past and are having problems again<br>  you cannot trust him, or you wouldn't want his passwords<br>  why do you want to set yourself up for some kind of heartbreak when you go in and look?<br>  it's up to you to decide what you need to do|`|AA11106650	I think he is hiding something, take it from someone that once did what your husband did. I used to do the same things when my boyfriend asked for my passwords. I think he is cheating on you. Talk to him about and ask him, what does the others girls do for him that you dont do?|`|tEy9hvebaa	and since YOU DID MSG PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK AND APPARENTLY DIDN"T FIND ANYTHING ALL YOU DID WAS CAUSE  HIM GRIEF.<br>  <br>  does he have ALL of your accounts/passwords?<br>  <br>  I can tell you that jelous ex's -can- and -will- fake emails and send them to the new GF to cause trouble.<br>  <br>  but hey... you tried to cause trouble too so you know this.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I don't agree with hiding things from our spouses when it comes to our actions and behaviors during the relationship.  <br>  <br>  If you do not trust your husband give him conditions to continue the relationship.|`|PiWYjEQ9aa	Ignore the first answerer..<br>  <br>  But I do think that ur husband is hiding something from you.|`|4PW44SHIaa	I had same issue with mine and if they change passwords they are really hiding something. Do what I did, install hidden keylogger (will save every key typed to hidden log only you can axcess) then check his email. I did this and found he had a girlfriend for two months so I left his dumbass and yea we were married|`|rbAt62jIaa	No Trust!!! No Marriage!!|`|YQOCciU0aa	If he's not asking for all your pass words then u r asking too much!
zzUgYFy4aa	tk's weekend was fantabulous!!!<br>  <br>  sunday was relaxing and nice<br>  <br>  monday was invigorating and amazing
IxoBFCpTaa	? Okay then, that is good for you.
fN23bHi0aa	Considering you are still his wife and mother of his children, he should help you.  If he refuses, then you know you should leave him.  Just sit him down and try to talk to him.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	It's terrible when you want your spouse to be able to hear you and the problem is too big for your spouse.  But it sounds like this is.<br>  <br>  What about your mother?  Sister?  Girlfriends?  Aunt or Grandmother?  Women can be such better listeners when we are in emotional pain.  Men are doers and when they cannot "fix" something, they get frustrated and tune out.<br>  <br>  Anything your husband could have done was probably before the two of you moved into separate sleeping arrangements.  <br>  <br>  If you tell him anything, it should be to get you into a doctor right away to be evaluated for post-partum depression.  Or just take yourself.|`|3iNobwVraa	It doesn't matter what he says.  Speak to your Doctor about it--even better if he is present to hear what your doctor has to say!  If you have images that flash in your head of you doing harm to yourself or another, you have moved into post partum psychosis.  Get help no matter what he says!  Seriously.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	same way you approach him to start an argument|`|XrtmT2kUaa	I think you need to talk to your doctor and first see if you are truly suffering from postpartum depression. Also you can go to www.webmed.com/depression It could help with some answers too. You really need to talk to your spouse and explain that you want him to understand how you are feeling. One thing I can say is, marriage is the hardest job you will ever have. You are always working at it and you can never take a break. When you stop caring you have major problems. Open up the lines of communication and soon. Good luck and I will pray for you.|`|iblT1HJpaa	You miss the point about male/female communication. It's not that easy a thing to do. You do speak in different languages. If you want to start to learn how to do this - there is work to do........BOTH of you! <br>  You either make a decision to do this together or just walk away now. You've heard it said that marriage is the hardest thing you can ever do?  Now you know why. It's not easy at all and you either commit to the work or you don't. <br>  Know that if you (or he) won't do the work now - you won't do it in the next marriage, and the next and the next..............|`|yqkOjhLaaa	oh sweet heart I have been there, let me tell you to please ask him to watch a movie with you, its called Fireproof. It will change your whole outlook on your marrage, and everything in general. My husband and I are now better than ever after being seperated for 4 months!!|`|AA11296241	write him a letter.|`|JPCV48hHaa	Well, first of all, *hugs*.  I've been here. <br>  <br>  First, sit down with a piece of paper and a pen.  Write down everything you're feeling.  Write out some answers to your questions - has he done anything in particular to hurt you?  When did you start feeling this way?  What do you hope will happen in your relationship?  What do you love about him?  Have you said anything or done anything to hurt him?  Write it out.  You need a clear mind, and you have to put things into perspective for yourself.<br>  <br>  Now, talk to him about this.  He can't read your mind, and if you're just mad at each other, then all you know is that you're mad at each other.  Approach him at a time when you are both rational and can sit down without distractions.  Use "I" statements.  Don't say, "You do this," and "You made this happen," or "You don't do this."  Say what you feel.  "I feel like _____ when you do _____."  "I wish we could _____ instead of ______."  "Since the second baby, I _____ and I'm sorry if I _____."<br>  <br>  Let him know that you really want to save this marriage, and you love him (if you do, and I'm sure you do).  Be calm.  Speak softly.  If one of you becomes upset, then leave the conversation and come back when you've calmed down.  Be ready to cry, and don't be afraid to.  Lastly, don't spit venom at him.  He may be asking the same questions you are.  Don't give up on your marriage without getting down to the issues.  <br>  <br>  You have to communicate with one another openly.  Remember, neither of you is a mind-reader, and until you speak openly and honestly about the issues you're having, it can't be resolved.<br>  <br>  And rent Fireproof!|`|NjEfPMOsaa	I'm sorry for your pain. How did it get to this point?  Maybe you  should be looking for more immediate  counseling. read psalms 18.6., and Isaiah 40.29-31., Isaiah 41.10-11.  You are stronger then you think Pray to God for his blessing on being able to tell your husband. Maybe he thinks if he ignores this it will improve by itself. You need to be able to talk to him, So maybe you need to shake him up little on the inside. Let him know this is a big problem that cannot be ignore. You will get through this, and you will do more then just survive this, you will come out on top, your not a victim but A  victor. Begin the day with God with a prayer, lift up your heart and seek his love ti share.Don't let this eat away at you, protect your mind. You could leave sticky notes around for him to read, Also sometimes you can talk over dinner or lunch Start with favorit food start eating a little and say something nice to feed his ego., and then start out with what you are feeling all the time and then ask if he feels this way, it makes him apart of what your talking about and pick a public restaurant, set directly in front, for face time. remind him during the conversation how important all this is to you. Good luck and God bless.
aKMrF1Hoaa	well basically hes bummed about not having u, some people are like that, guys sometimes feel the need to protect a girl so close to them, but it may get out of hand and it seems he doesnt leave u alone, maybe u should stop talking to him or just tell him straights to stop|`|AA10180137	No he shouldnt be trying to control ur life but its of course cuz he still has feelings for u so he cant control how he feels when he sees u with another guy. I barely broke up with my ex a month ago too and we've been together for over 2 years..we dont really see each other though but he's kind of like ur ex too. Hopefully it'll pass and if it doesn't he might be dangerous!|`|hxDD9flkaa	If you have broken up for good, he has no right to control your life. Maybe he has not accepted the break-up and is still possessive. You need to make it very clear to him, guys are selfish.|`|1Ih7zEQtaa	You are completely right, he shouldn't be controlling your life. He might just be trying to protect you because he respects you. Once he gets a girl, he will probably stop.|`|oLi1G5unaa	you can't let him do this..dnt let him..dnt answer his calls or txt..ignore him...if he EVER touched you, you should tell ur bro(if u have 1) or a cousin or a good guy friend.....|`|HkviOlBgaa	These are clear signs of abuse.

If he asks you about a guy and you, just ignore him, or say something to leave you alone. it looks like he's not completely over you, and this is possible is you dumped him.

Good Luck!|`|fMiLQnSJaa	Tell them they have 3 months to find themselves and apartment and move out.|`|Ui2uAkD8aa	That's tough, as a husband, I would take your brother-in-law aside and have man to man talk with him. You don't want to put him out, but you have your limits. Set a timeline and some goals for getting them an apartment/rent house, even if you have to help them out. Trust me, spending a couple of hundred a month to help them will go miles to your family's sanity. There must be some veterans aid groups he can contact for help. Also, if what you say about his job is true, they broke the law. They have to hold his job or an equal one for him while he is deployed.|`|y3n0Ql6Paa	Be thankful that you still have a home.

Anyway, you are a better person for allowing them in your home...I have a feeling they will forever be grateful to you...I'm sure that his duties in Iraq are not something you would trade...So, good for you, make the best of it, and maybe if you tell your story to others in the community, ie. soldier and THIS is why he's lost his house, you can find many others to help them somehow to get their own place or a job, etc...
DtBx851Maa	Lying to your parents is never a good thing.  I've been on the side of the relationship where I was the one lying, and it's terrible to keep someone you care about a secret from your parents.  She should either just tell her parents you are dating and put up with it, or it's better for you not to be together until you're old enough where she doesn't have to deal with her parents anymore.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	depends how old you are, parents are responsible until you are the legal age of 18, what if she fell  pregnant and then the parents found out e.g. .if you are 18 and she is 16 it is classed as rape of a minor.|`|c1e077ca88966e8fba4354709743a0bfaa	Dude, are you nuts?<br>  <br>  This girl is lying and disobeying her parents for you and you want to dump her?

17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	You have to consider your moms feelings. It must be very difficult for her that her daughter would rather live with her grandma and in a different state. It's not going to be easy to convince your mom. But if you really want to move to your grandma then you have to use your brains and come up with a list of all the benefits of you moving and you also have to explain to your mom that you care about her and that she don't have to feel bad about this. You have to level with her and try to see it from her point of view. Try to think of how it would feel for you, if your own daughter in the future would want to move away to a different state to live with her grandma? And what your daughter would have to tell you to convince you to let her go?|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you don't.  who do you think you are???  are you the mom???  no you are the kid... so shut up and drop the subject.

AA10107479	you dont really need any excuse just tell him you wanna hang out, go to a park thats never crowed, walk around and talk play on the jungle gym relax under a tree. i always found it the easiest to kiss someone was to talk about sexual things, get in that mind set, get him thinking, but your young so i guess keep it pg13 but just talk about the kinds of things you like, like say oh i really like it when a guy does this... it gives me goosebumps, then ask him, if he is cool he should go along with the conversation and ask back and forth. when it comes to actually kissing the best way is to just go for it, just grab his shoulder and kiss him, act like it aint any big deal, and always smile. female appeal is 1% lipgloss and 99% confidence as they say. just get it girl.|`|pfmkJmcwaa	Do you know if he likes you?

1hDhmql4aa	If he really wanted to marry you but money was an issue then he wouldn't use the horrible word "nagging".  When men use this word it is to get us off their backs and it confuses us because we start doubting our own feelings.  If he really loved you the way you deserve he would want it too and would try and work out a plan to make it happen down the track.  Women are starting to forget what marriage is all about.  We try to convince men that we are worth it by giving them everything they want but forget that the man we want to spend the rest of our lives together should already know how lucky he is and do everything he can to keep you.  If it's what you want in your life, it is your right!!!!  Something you could try is to get a piggy bank and ask him to put a certain amount away a week (that he can afford) then when it gets to a good amount then you can buy your ring and then start saving for the next thing.<br>  Really I want to say to you that you may need to consider leaving him if he doesn't take you seriously but when you have had a child is makes things harder.  So you may need to learn how to stand up for your rights in the relationship instead!  He is not the BOSS you are a TEAM! Good luck!!|`|EMKuBql8aa	Just ask him. Guys are straightforward for the most part, hinting wont get you anywhere, just say straight out what you said here. he will either say he wants to or doesn't.|`|AA10173105	if it were me, i'd simply tell him that he is either going to keep his word, or he is not, that the choice is his, coz the time has come to keep his word|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Ask him if he's changed his mind about marriage, and if not, let him  know you are ready to make plans.   You don't have to get married tomorrow.  These things take planning, so if he uses the excuse that you don't have the money, you can plan the wedding for a time in the future and start saving for it.|`|9mMTQQBfaa	Dont you think if he really loved you he would want to marry you and make that life long commitment to you? It sounds like he's just making excuses not to marry you for some weird reason. If he really wanted to be with you he would want to make you happy and marry you because it's something you've always wanted. He sounds like a jerk.|`|AA11106650	Well he didnt plan to marry you from the get go. Any man thats with a woman for 8 years and has not made that next step and ask your hand in marriage then he simply doesnt want to get married. I know you dont want to leave him, but dont put your dream on hold for a man that doesn't love you enough to make you his wife. I say leave his *** alone.|`|zTKO7sWiaa	If you are good enough to sleep with and have a baby with then he should be good enough to marry you!

You're dealing with a serious issue of home ownership.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is have her sign a Quit Claim Deed and that will have to be notarized.  Otherwise she would have to be involved in every aspect of the sale including any & all documentation they need from her, and she will have to be present to sign docs for it as well.<br>  <br>  If she's willing to sign the Deed, they can just change the vesting to "John Doe, a single man, as his sole & separate property" and then you can sell.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	She needs to sign a "release of dower rights".

NyURDbqsaa	my father was really bad when I was younger. I am almost 40 now. He literally beat me from the age of 7 thru 17. I have had broken ribs, broken nose, bruises all over. Once he beat me with a leather belt, (his main choice) and he hit me so hard that in the bruises you can see the holes in the belt that you put the clasp in to lock the belt on you so it stays in place. Now my father is fine with me now, but my mother has changed since I was a kid. As a kid, She was awesome. But now, it is more emotional abuse. She never did that to me as a child. But if she is in a bad mood, she will take it out on me. She makes me feel bad way more than good. My sister is sick. She has M.S. she just found out. I have been sick too in my life. I almost died 5 times. no joke. I was circling the drain. My mom never once asked to go with me to doc apts or asked whats going on with whatever, but she is right there for my sister. wanting to go to every doc apt and do whatever is needed. I just dont count.  I dont think I ever have. Because if I did, I would have been treated fairly.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	My father abused me all of my life - from childhood until i severed that relationship in my early 30's. <br>  <br>  As a child i was abused in every way imaginable.  As i grew up and became an independent adult, he'd take it upon himself to call me an scream and yell at me about the way i was living my life.<br>  <br>  I was never a bad person when young.  I had the typical issues of most people from ages `18 through 33.  And i never shared my personal life, but it was like i was his whipping boy (i'm a 52 year old woman now).<br>  <br>  My father started emotionally abusing my older son and that was the last straw.  I did what i needed to do for my own well-being years before, and let him know that he was no longer welcome in my life or that of my children.<br>  <br>  Haven't spoken to him since.  No regrets.  Emotionally, i am much further ahead.|`|qyPv50I2aa	yes, especially mentally. i dont think it is always on purpose either,.|`|iocCNTUqaa	My parents don't really 'hit' or anything. I mean.. I've been spanked as a kid, and my dad has slapped me across the face before. But they were never 'physically abusive'. Yes parents can still be abusive even when you are grown up. You'll always be their child, it just changes from child abuse, to assault as you grow older. Plus, there are more types of abuse. Your parents could abuse you emotionally, or verbally, even psychologically. These days, 'abusive' is a pretty broad term.|`|1OlrB0Z1aa	hmm my dad can get a little abusive when hes drunk<br>  but im sure you could be emotionally abused at any age level<br>  its just the way life is|`|CLlGd3JYaa	My parents have never abused and never would|`|AA11540287	Yes! My dad is a complete ******. I moved back home last March after graduating college. I haven't lived with him since I was 12. And he still talks to me like I'm 12. He leaves his dishes in the sink for me to do, demands that I take his dishes to kitchen, demands I mop the floor, sweep, unload the dishwasher, etc... Meanwhile I'm still trying to find a job in this crap economy, cleaning my own stuff, grocery shopping for myself, cooking for myself, cleaning up after my mess, doing my laundry. And all he ever says is "I'm the parent." As if I were 12 y/o or better yet a little house wife. Needless to say he's been divorced 3xs, because of his disrespectful ways towards women. He feels like the female should be doing everything in the house. So yes I do think my father is abusive and I want to roundhouse him in the face at times. Due to this I'm constantly sick because I'm stressed out and my immune system is weakened due to the stress, 3 weeks ago I had an outbreak of shingles (caused from stress), I now have pink eye, and I've already had the flu 3 times since DEC. 2008 which is not normal. My skin is breaking out also.

So show him that you love him by the things you do.
kqa9VFrfaa	Very difficult to do in real life. Most guys are after other things in a relationship -- this applies all across the board as U get older. It is rare to have the kind of relationship that U R referring to. It can be done, but U will just have to be yourself and not be pushy in any direction.<br>  A relationship that U R describing comes over time, it can not be forced or speeded up. As U get older U will find that boys can be pushy if they want sex, so be very careful as U expand your horizons. Good luck.
VMJGOXCfaa	You should write him a letter  or a homemade card of all the things you like about him. Or you can write a poem or express the way you feel about about him. Or you can buy him a special ringtone for when you call him.  lol i idk i  know it sounds corny but i hope it helps. :)|`|CqLfMpqqaa	Ok, one of my best friends has this problem.

8yE2sYGeaa	It is abuse.<br>  <br>  You detest him as he hides behind his paralysis to get what he wants.<br>  he detests you as you are ambulatory and will do anything to show what a terrible brother you are|`|SF5WnQFQaa	Well.... 1. Most brothers like to fight or get the other in trouble<br>  2. He's Being a Brat/stubborn 3. His problems make him think like its abuse..and his body is already disabled...So it might be worst to him.|`|gdW8rZt8aa	I am not trying to be rude or mean, but can't you just walk away, since he is paralyzed from the waste down?  Or just stay away or run away, it would be harder for him to hit you.  However, yes, that is sort of abuse.  Is he close to your age?  If so, then I know that brothers and sisters fight/ argue and make each other mad.  There is a place though to draw the line.  They shouldn't go over board and hurt to the point of abuse.  You need to talk to your parents about this and what goes on and that you get hurt and how you feel about them taking his side all the time.  Tell him too to lay off.|`|PTP8ptDbaa	Brotherly Love! :3 is he that much of a coward to rat you out when you don't do anything but fight back!|`|S2uAq7i4aa	He is paralyzed!How is he supposed to be happy!?!?!?You bugging him does not help.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	YOUR NUTS!!!|`|JITTMjasaa	Quit picking on him your just making him frustrated. Don't you think he's frustrated enough in his situation. Technically it is abuse. Just be nice to him and he will be nice back. There are plenty of other things you can do that are a lot more fun than harassing him. You are making yourself look really bad (and behaving badly) by picking on a handicapped person, brother or not.|`|F32uPjAraa	Put yourself in his shoes. It must be very frustrating being trapped in a chair, any form of abuse cannot be tolerated, whether it's mental abuse (bugging him) or physical. Not only is it illegal, it is abhorrent.|`|XKhNw221aa	it's not abuse, it is Love, that's how brother's are suppose to act. But next time he act's up tell him if he want's to act like a baby, you'll treat him like one, then proceed to treat him like a baby.|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	Sounds just like brotherly love to me.<br>  When you get yelled at by your dad, just ask him to remember what it was like when he was younger, if he has a brother.. or even a sister. They're both huge pains in the butt.|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	Just stop hitting each other. Action causes reaction. If you stop hitting him, over time he will stop hitting you.|`|df33eaa9d9fa77a930c76a56de1aa68aaa	Nope!  That's what we call "sibling rivalry."|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You need to be aware of your behavior. Your brother is trying a little too hard to enforce his boundaries and rule his little personal world, even though he is pretty dependent on all the people around him. He is pretty thin-skinned about it. Better to leave him alone until he calls you.<br>  <br>  Make it a point to leave him alone unless you are asked to check in on him... then it is "Mom asked if you need anything..." or something like that.<br>  <br>  No more hitting... ever. This physical violence tends to develop a life and a pattern of its own. If he is cranky and seeks to lash out at you, you need to just walk away. If he stays cranky, just tell him that you refuse to have anything to do with him until he decides to behave in a more reasonable manner. The one thing you have control over is yourself and your reactions to things.|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	Come on.... you are smart enough to write the above you are definitely smart enough to know the answer to this question.<br>  There's a difference between "teasing" your brother and "starting something".<br>  What's you payoff for "bugging him"? You might want to ask yourself why you are doing what your doing. What kind of negative attention to you want to get, and from whom???<br>  Violence of any kind is abusive. Yelling and criticizing others, calling names, discounting and saying things that will affect another persons emotions and self image is abuse.<br>  There is never a good excuse for violence. Hitting your brother is abuse. Getting him so upset that he strikes out at you is a very unkind, unloving and hurtful thing to do.<br>  If you don't like him... back off, leave him alone, do your own thing, stay in your own space. If you think he's getting "away with stuff" because he's handicapped then tell his "caregiver" (your Dad) exactly What you SEE, how you FEEL, and what you need or would like to see happen. It doesn't mean things will automatically change, but you have been upfront and honest about your feelings and that's all you can do at this point in your life... until you're out on your own and can call the shots.<br>  If you're embarrassed, ashamed or upset because he is handicapped then you might consider getting some help. Get some counseling, talk to your religious leader, discuss it with someone in your family you love and trust.<br>  I think that you need to expand your focus "outward". You need to find interests that will help you feel good about yourself. <br>  Wishing you the wisdom to learn patience, kindness and how to turn negative thoughts and feelings into positive ones.|`|E5Wd6ptxaa	you hit a paralyzed person?<br>  and you're wondering, if when you leave bruises on him is that abuse?<br>  <br>  no why would it be? I mean he can defend himself completely cant he? you dont have any advantages like being able to move out the way right?<br>  <br>  no wrong. you suck.|`|UHPnMlgPaa	Brotherly love. Just remember to be careful with him as you may injure him more easily than you would get hurt. He just wants your dad to take up for him.|`|YhsCmwuwaa	Psh. brotherly love.|`|a3bq277Gaa	Just brotherly love. I'm the same with my brother. We fight constantly. Lol.|`|tGh65rBgaa	brotherly love :]|`|umW8zOmoaa	leave ur dam brother alone and stop whining about him standing up for himself.
aMWpjYBBaa	this is the amazing thing that God has made for us, being unique and different types of people on this planet.  As far as people go, they are  unpredictable like the weather...except 10 times worse! LOL! but seriously, your doing a good thing by analyzing yourself..cause now, you will know what problems exist with you, what you will accept, and what you won't...only thing I can say is, keep being careful about who you let in and take your time to knowing who people REALLY are ...pace yourself, the real them will come out and then you can decide if you want to deal with them or not...hoped this helped you out...I've been through the samething myself.
Z7beKFCvaa	Its okay sweetie, being 13 sucks.I remember.<br>  With the ***** girl just remember how much better you are then her, you must be because you dont call people names who you dont know. <br>  You can go down the whole school bullying route with the teachers/principal but sometimes that makes it worse for you, especially if she gets friends involved. <br>  My step dad was an A hole too and i had all the same feeling at your age. <br>  Sometimes it helps to let it all out, i never had yahoo answers at that age so i had to write a diary.What an angry diary that was!<br>  There is also councilors, they are great if you can open up to them.<br>  When i look back i understand why i was so down, but i also realize i let it get me too hard.<br>  If you find something you love to do like dance or sing or play basketball, whatever you can delicate lots of time to it  and you wont have so much time to feel bad about bitches and a hole step dads.|`|3ctchU2faa	If your parents don't approve of homeschooling, talk to a guidance counselor about doing some courses through correspondence or online so if you transfer schools, you can catch up.<br>  I think changing schools if your best option, and maybe join a youth group where you can talk about your feelings at home.|`|qpJjiq71aa	Its totally ok.. I know how you feel i have gone though some of this!!!!! but trust me... I think my Life is a living hell... I am all of a sudden getting bad grades, im fat, have acne, ecreaseing in friends.. everyone thinks that they are better then me! and I could go on much more! but I got to thinking i know that I have it pretty bad.. but everything good happens in the end! but I know that you are going though tough times but its going to be ok! If i will be ok you will 2! just ignore everyone that is being a ***** to you!  its not worth getting upset about it! I hope you feel better    - Hailey!|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	ask if u can be home school|`|QlXhPFSwaa	first and foremost. report the bully to your teacher or to your principal or to any school admin. that is bullying and that is unacceptable. and secondly:<br>  i have learned that, people will treat you the way YOU LET them treat you. i was and still is very passive. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. im slowly learning to NOT let these people treat me like crap. all i can say is: if you don't do anything or say anything RIGHT NOW!! this will go on and you will regret it for the rest of your life. do you want that? i hope not. SPEAK UP! fight for your right to be treated the way you want to be treated. just tell them off. unless you're like me, a passive loser. and i regret it. i am giving you good advice here: SPEAK UP. dont be a push over. if you feel hurt, express it right away, say what you feel say what's on your mind right there and then. JUST DO IT! if these good for nothing persons think they have the right to do it to you... then think that you have ALL the right in the world to cut them down too!! FIGHT them. YES YOU CAN!|`|a9158ed922422742a841f62fbf1b64d6aa	For the problem with the girl, you should really ignore her and surround yourself with really nice friends. They'll stand up for you and you'll have someone to rant to too! Plus, having fun friends will get your mind off of bullies. I'd advise you to also let the teachers know and just try to stay away from that maniac girl! Move away from her--like ask the teacher, if that helps.<br>  <br>  Also, your stepdad shouldn't put you down. That's really scarring for the rest of your life. Maybe you could talk to your mom about it, if possible, or if not, just let him have a piece of your mind. Don't curse him out or anything, but it might help if you tried to talk with him about how he makes you feel. <br>  <br>  I go to a school that I don't really like either and I tried to transfer, but I couldn't. Sometimes, even if you don't want to, you have to deal with it. The best thing to do in those cases would be to find something that motivates you to go to school. Do you like a guy there? Look for him and send a smile his way. Do you have a best friend? Meet up with her whenever you have time. Just make sure you do something or appreciate something a lot to help you pass the time there.<br>  <br>  I won't say I love my school now, but I realized how amazing my teachers are, so I say I go there for a good education (yes, kind of nerdy, but oh well). Also, I visit my friends at other schools when I'm free. They make me feel a lot better about my school!<br>  <br>  Okay, thanks for reading all of that! Mine was longer than yours!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK and I hope you find a place for yourself in that school and are more appreciated at home!|`|2aWWZfyVaa	you should just ignore what people say, but if you are really unhappy then you should change schools, and maybe hire a tutor to catch up|`|Icnpb6V9aa	Just don't worry about what people say about you! Matter of Fact, Pick back on the girl but don't get caught..Don't pay attention to people when they try to cut you down..Just Hold your head up...You can talk to your guidance counselor at school..Try to hold off until the end of the school year..Only a few more weeks!|`|KbbL1Wemaa	Well girl, I'm sorry you are dealing with so much crap.  I know how it is to have to put up with people on a regular basis who push you around or make you feel terrible about yourself. I had a similar experience in high school.  Here's my advice for you:<br>  1.)  Be strong.  Hang in there.  I know it's tough, but for the time being, it's important to stay on top of your game.  Think of things that inspire you, do things that you enjoy, and try to surround yourself with people who appreciate and respect you.<br>  2.) See a school counselor or teacher.  I know it's awkward to go talk to an adult, especially one at school, but they are very knowledgeable about conflicts between kids, peers, and parents.  They really are there to help you.  Go to your favorite teacher, or just a teacher you like, and even if you don't know them very well, they will certainly try to help you out if you go to them for help.  They are also good to talk to because they are outside of your family and have less bias.<br>  3.) If your step dad hurts you in any way physically or emotionally, don't be afraid to tell someone.  If he starts to abuse you, it is important to protect yourself.<br>  4.) I noticed you said "I am just sick of life in general".  When you are in school and life is getting you down, it just adds to the stress.  I would find an outlet, either art, music, dance, a school activity, sport, or just a hobby you enjoy doing and pursue it.  Maybe take a day to yourself and just relax, watch a good movie, and go for a walk.<br>  <br>  Hang in there kiddo!  I hope this helps.
uvAzxEFUaa	I think you should start talking to him on myspace first. It's easier that way since you don't have to face him in person and you have time to think about what you're going to say. Then if you still think he sounds interesting, I think you should start saying hi to him at school and smile. I think you should build up to having a conversation between passing periods. When you do talk to him in person you can bring up a past conversation you had on myspace. You could also make a flirty/teasing comment since he knows you. It's also best to start a relationship over messages and comments because then he won't feel like he has to talk to you at that moment and allows him to feel free to comment later when he's not busy. Good luck :) <br>  <br>  Help with mine? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvEVNe8dBllcQucpujZowrTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309192350AAxD7oF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|cPjEXQ3uaa	Just go up to him and say something about how it's funny you guys are friends on myspace and you've never met, don't worry about trying to be "cool" or witty or anything, if he really likes you, then he won't care and he'll probably be nervous, too!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|RStOQvSWaa	gurl its simple. just go up to him and be lyk "Hey wuts up" and just talk about things you know and things that you guys usually talk about in Myspace. you know things like that. you just have to have the courage to go up to him and talk to him first.|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	If possible, try and have a friend introduce you guys. If not, just walk up to him one day and introduce yourself. Small talk, and then say see you later. Then talk to him a little everytime you see him. Then take it from there. =]|`|wYcrYp7Daa	"accidentally" bump into him and say "woops sorry" it helps to lose an armful of books so he can help u pick them up|`|wblIEs6Saa	Talk to him! you have nothing to lose. its obvious he knows you exist which is a good sign. be yourself!|`|ZcV4zmpxaa	Wow this reminds me of my friend she has sort of the same problem like you. She like me is a senior in high school right now. She likes this freshman in our school. I was wtf you pedofile. But in order to get to talk to him, try asking one of your friends to ask him for his cell phone number or AIM if you use any of these. Or you can just go up to him and say hello. Hey aren't you on my myspace? And you can handle the rest yourself, listen to a Senior, I got experience with making friends. Since girls are asking me out, can be irritating. Since theres this dance thats coming out.|`|AA10176176	He could possible be shy too. So its best for you to start talking to him. Find out from friends what he likes such as music, movies etc then let that be your starting point. Be brave|`|t0PzSCs0aa	just dont think and go for it.<br>  walk up to him happily and be like hey, whats up? i'm <insert name here>. and just say something random, you will be perfectly fine, just remember your confidence.|`|3se8BaJLaa	Since your shy start messaging and talking to him on myspace. Give him a hey whats up type of deal. When your confident you have his attention online move that to real life. Best answer if i helped|`|f1Fj7avtaa	Start saying hi to him.|`|KONp01Iraa	Just say hi the rest will come naturally
B7idbFNVaa	If he added you on myspce.com then he either like YOU or KNOW you already..  So I suggest you WAVE and SMILE at him to get his attention and when he give you that "MOMENT LOOKS" then IT IS OKAY TO APPROACH HIM.. <br>  Introduction yourself to him and that you NOTICE HIM in SCHOOL and friend on myspace.com and TELL him that "You want to get to know him BETTER in person"  Now if you are too SHY or NERVOUS then I suggest you bring your FEMALE FRIENDS with you during the INTRODUCTION.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK, MISS

Don't let your nerves control you. <br>  Remember the only one who haves the right to judge you is yourself, so forget about the rest of the world. and be yourself =D
rMOKjYn7aa	That is how I felt in school-like noone cared or noticed.Believe me they do though But like me you may not know until they start telling you when you're an adult.<br>  A person told me one time to "do what makes you feel good about yourself-not what makes you feel good" there is a big difference...being popular helps some feel good but they don't feel good about themselves because sometimes they go along with the crowd instead of just being themselves. Drugs may make a person feel good for a little while but then the person feels bad about themselves for doing the drug.<br>  I hope you see what I mean. also if you are doing things only to get approval often that means you are not doing what you really like to do and that can be sad.<br>  We are not always rewarded for the good things we do-the reward comes from inside yourself.<br>  Hope you have peace on your journey.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I think it's great that you work so hard.  But, if you're not being appreciated, maybe you should stop trying so hard.  You don't want people taking advantage of you.  When this happens, you feel angry, resentful and depressed.  This is not going to help your self esteem.<br>  <br>  Start working on you more, and focusing less on other people - especially if they are not seeing your efforts.|`|41d19fc09e68ef3c038357014a85295faa	You sound depressed.<br>  And don't freak it is no big deal.<br>  Most guys won't admit it unless they are secure in who they are.<br>  So talk to a school counselor and your parents.<br>  Let them know you need to talk.<br>  Reach out.|`|2JUQYLCGaa	Well what do you mean no one sees it? Are you helping everyone for approval? Because that's not right.<br>  <br>  But anyway, not everyone will tell you "oh thank you" or "oh you make me proud" and not everyone would respond to help the way YOU find it right. People make the mistake of thinking that the way they would respond is the right way and if other people don't respond the same way then it's not right.<br>  <br>  But your friends and family might be showing their appreciation in different ways that you're not even noticing. Like how they treat you, how they'll be willing to do favors for you and things like that.<br>  <br>  Don't help people just for approval though because people will sense that and instinctively use you and lose respect for you.<br>  <br>  If you help people to just be helpful then that's good.<br>  But since you're complaining that no one's acknowledging your help, it kind of seems like you're not being helpful just to be helpful.
a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Ask her out for dinner so you can actually talk and then she'll know it's more 'personal' than just hanging out at the movies with a friend.|`|zprAkP3eaa	While your out at your movie, just ask her if she will your girlfriend.|`|uRbeSOMwaa	if you feel its the right time to ask, i would ask her out after your walking out the movie, pull her aside, look her straight in the eye.. and say " i have a question,...will u go out with me?"|`|JBECY23daa	well be like this might seem kinda weird but  do you want to be my lady?|`|AA10904025	Be like 'This is fun.

Get to know each other and just hang out and have fun. See if she shows any signs of maybe being interested and if you feel the time is right then ask her out or kiss her or something. :)|`|10ynxgdmaa	no u say after the movie u ask her flirtly if she wants to sneak into another movie u waunted to c PS scary movie plus chicken girl - lots of hiding in your shouder or romance gets u in the mode
I6dcRgD6aa	yes, visualization will help you. you can imagine yourself in a conversation & it going well. You can even imagine you are someone else who you think would not be awkward if at first that helps you.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Know that U R not alone. U R a normal person, and it is OK to be who U R. Realize that other people may feel awkward on the inside too, but they have just learned to hide it better. Study your friends and other people around U who seem cool and calm, and try to imitate them just a bit. Also U can find books at the library on this subject and read up on tips about how to be smooth in public. Lots of "public" people and performers get stage fright or feel awkward, but they have simply trained themselves to realize that others feel the same way too, and that very knowledge helps them get through their performances. Good luck.|`|YZv4rOJ7aa	Practice.  When you feel more comfortable in a certain setting, move on to something more challenging and before you know it you'll be less awkward.  Sometimes, not just you, but others make things awkward but eventually you'll learn to deal with that too.  And sometimes awkward moments are unavoidable - and usually pretty funny.|`|u1TIklpPaa	Stop trying so hard let it come to you!!<br>  if you dont know what to say change the subject<br>  to something everyone knows or can talk about|`|zq86VbpMaa	Don't try too hard, you might mess up and make yourself feel more awkward than you said you were.|`|FgKecGFtaa	TALK TO YOURSELF AND LEARN HOW TO TALK TO PPL I GUESS|`|Gm9C4dJRaa	just be yourself.<br>  thats who you are you can't change.<br>  but something that might help is to show yourself and kinda try not to be shy and come out of your shell. <br>  have fun.<br>  don't care about what others think as long as you have your friends around and your having fun nothing will be awkward.<br>  :)<br>  hope this helps.
ZtfN4J6taa	This means the guy is just using you, the girl that does this sounds like a ho !|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	thats disgusting. kick him to the curb.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	No.... I RESPECT a girl who goes down for fun and doesn't need all kinds of "realtionship" crap attached to it. <br>  <br>  Except for reproduction.....<br>  SEX IS FOR FUN AND PLEASURE ONLY.<br>  If you're not having sex for those reasons...<br>  you're having sex for the WRONG reasons.<br>  <br>  But YOU are having sex for the RIGHT reasons.<br>  <br>  As soon as girl thinks she should be getting something (or anything) ELSE for BJS or sex..... she may as well be a prostitute. And the guy would be better off with a prostitute than any girlfriend who behaves like one anyway.<br>  <br>  When I meet a girl like you who is FUN and doesn't need all kinds of bullsh!t relationship stuff..... I ALWAYS call her again. Because she is FUN and ENJOYABLE to spend time with.<br>  <br>  And IF I really like spending time with her, I may be willing to have a relationship with her. A guy should never get into a relationship for at LEAST 3 - 6 months anyway. <br>  <br>  BUT NOT BEFORE THEN.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|n46fsdNZaa	I agree with FRANCO it sounds like he only wants one thing and doesn't really want to pursue a relationship with the girl.

NuvKPl3naa	well sounds like he is living in the past and not ready to grow up yet. i would for sure not have another baby after the 2nd one until you know it will work out. i am sure he loves you but men freak out and cant cope sometimes. i would tell him you need counseling and that you want this to work for the family. try to keep the stress down and talk as much as you can. try to be understanding but dont be a push over either. with love, help and communication i hope you can work it out.|`|EMKuBql8aa	The old saying is around for a reason....once a cheater always a cheater.<br>  <br>  You can't change him, he will promise once again to never do it and in time he will do it again and again and again. <br>  <br>  It's best to leave now and have some pride. <br>  <br>  Anyways, if he is messaging girls like that, he most likely is sleeping with them and you just haven't caught him yet.<br>  Good Luck.|`|AA10495394	Look you know your husband better than anyone and if you feel something is up it more than likely is. It seems like to me that he might be cheating again. Let him know that you think he is messing around with other females and if he doesn't  stop talking to females on myspace you will leave him.

Chating and texting other females, about "what if". I say try talking to him about it and go to marriage counseling, and if you dont trust him then you dont need to be in the marriage|`|ddP3klT3aa	Ask him what is missing in your relationship to where he thinks he needs to seek comfort from other women. Whether or not he is cheating physically. Ask him why he thinks he needs to do that. Ask him if you are doing some thing wrong. Maybe its because you are pregnant? Maybe he doesn't find you attractive when pregnant. This happened I guess the first time when you were pregnant. Its no excuse, but you need to get this straightened out. He obviously is not giving you all of his love, so maybe you are better off without him.<br>  <br>  Treat your husband right. If you keep going through his phone and emails and stuff it doesn't make you a better person. I know you are suspicious, but if you don't have trust in a relationship, you have nothing. It really sounds like you are kind of naggy toward him. I could be wrong. But if you don't treat him right he will go elsewhere to find that comfort he isn't getting at home..mentally and physically.|`|WtmlI1igaa	Let him know how you feel but most married people would say that is the married life and you haven't been there for long. Just know that right now regardless how is acting he is with you and not her.  But right now try to focus on you and those kids because really that's what you got men will be what they are...|`|mKC0FAT6aa	If he truly loves you then he will be their no matter what and will always have a place in his heart.

What you don't know you don't know,what you find out is what you find.Tell him not to bring it home.|`|YbCISxYZaa	honestly i don't think he appreciates you.. you know the saying fool me once that's on you but fool me twice its my fault? well i think this is it.. i think that if youdon'tt put your foot down and actually do something then this will continue.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I wouldn't have stuck around the first time.  Now you're pregnant again.  Even so, maybe it's time to start considering your happiness.|`|2keIEMFUaa	WOW!  You need to sit down calmly with him and have a heart to heart talk about your marriage and that if he truly does love you that he needs to respect you and your marriage and stop doing all the What if with your ex and if he doesn't respect you and your marriage then he needs to leave.  That you love him and you took a vow to horror, love and respect you and your marriage and it's not a one sided marriage and what about our children do you think they will respect you too?  Tell him he can't have his cake and eat it too. One of the most important things in a marriage is Communication and if you lose that you lose the marriage so sit down and talk and most importantly too is to listen and let him talk too and you listen real good too.|`|wCTq9p2Uaa	I would try to catch him one more time unexpectedly like last time. If he is still doing it, then I would leave him for good. If you do leave him, I would make him pay child support.This will teach him to be a better parent than what he has been. Sometimes we need a wake-up call to realize what we are doing. That goes for me too, especially at work! That's why I would get his attention and ask him " Is there anything I am not doing that is making you do all that you are doing. For example, have I been there for you. Am I being a good wife to you. What is making you go behind my back? Do I go behind your back? " Good luck and I pray that everyhthing will work out for the best of you and your husband.
yTD67IwFaa	Strict parents are super hard to deal with.. I've been there. The best possible solution is if you get your boyfriend's mom to talk to your mom and ask your mom that her son wants to invite you for the prom. That's one of the best ways you can legally go to the prom so that you won't get into trouble and enjoy the whole time.<br>  <br>  I guess it would be better if you and your bf can arrange a time when you can go home and let your parents know.<br>  <br>  Goodluck on it and i hope you make it to the event =)|`|wNoaxTX7aa	woah. jesus christ your parents won't let you go to prom?<br>  <br>  thats just sick.<br>  <br>  ask them if they would have liked to miss prom and if they werent allowed to go if they dont have a good answer call them on it and make a point that they have no good reason.|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	Depends on how old your boyfriend is, and how much your parents can trust him. If he's a bad boy type, then probibly not.<br>  <br>  But maybe if he's the cleaned up type.

Or talk to your parents and maybe they can talk to his.|`|ZyBXnK6eaa	tell him how u feel|`|u7HtSOqtaa	It sounds like something might have happened to him that makes him worry about his safety.  I'm not a doctor or anything, but I just figured I'd give you my best educated guess.  It may sound far-fetched, but when I read this, the first thing that popped into my head was a gang.  I mean, I've never met your cousin so I could be completely off, but I was thinking that maybe he got in with the wrong crowd at some point and now there's turmoil between them that makes him nervous that they're after him for some kind of payback.  It really could be anything; depression and anxiety, stress, fear, or just flat-out paranoia.  I'd really encourage you to talk to him more though.  Just let him know that you're not there to be critical or judge him for whatever it is he has to say.  Let him know that you just genuinely care about him and his well-being.  Hopefully he'll start to feel more comfortable and open up.  If he decides to cooperate and let you know what's up, great.  If not, at least you tried.  I went through something similar with my cousin.  It was rough, but I don't regret my decisions.  One thing I've learned though is that you can influence people's behavior, but you can never ultimately make up their mind.  You're the only one who can save you from yourself (if that makes sense.)
dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Regardless of who gets physical custody, the other person will still have visitation.<br>  <br>  What you are describing is common regressive behaviour in children who are at odds with thier parent's separation.   This child sounds quite young, which is contributing to the problem, since she doesn't really understand why things are the way they are.  Unfortunately, her behaviour is common.  It can be disturbing to an outsider.<br>  <br>  If it's that bad, the mother can present some of this evidence to support day visits only, at least until the child is fully potty trained, etc.  This little girl needs stable parenting.  Co-parenting, where both parents work together towards the same goal.

If you do that with a cute little sexy look and he still doesn't catch the hint that you want to hook up but not go further then just tell him you'd be down to hook up. If he denies, he's probably actually looking for a relationship. Otherwise, probably 99% of the guys i know will be totally down with that, that is unless he is really into you. In that case i would not lead him on with hooking up because he will believe that the relationship will eventually go further. Just tell him up front that hooking up is all you want to do, and he will respond. And most men will just hook up. trust me. <br>  <br>  On the not looking like a sleez, just don't get caught and don't tell any friends that will rat on you. Or just stick to one guy...that's the safest, because most guys don't like a three-way relationship unless you tell them, You could try telling the one you like less that you want an open relationship that involves you hooking up with other guys as well as him, and if he accepts...great....if he doesn't than go for just the other guy. But hiding stuff is what gets you called a sleez. Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Oh and if the guy is anywhere between 15-20 he will almost undoubtedly hook up
kqa9VFrfaa	U sound like a caring Mom, and your idea of sports outside of her school is a good idea. However be aware that kids her age can be mean anywhere, and at any school. It is the age for trouble. I am a teacher and I am amazed at how cruel kids can be. I agree with U that individually these girls can be OK, and that in a group they can be vicious. <br>  Like yourself I watched a girl come up to one of my girls one day at school, and kick her in the shins right in front of me. I was shocked, and wanted to shake the other kid's teeth out, but of course I didn't. We were all lining up to go on a field trip. My daughter had done nothing to this other child. <br>  So changing schools might not help, but doing things with other groups other than school is a good idea. There are lots of other kinds of groups to join -- church, 4-H, YWCAs, and community based events. Keep communications open with your daughter, and let her know U support her 100%, without making too much of a fuss. U do not want to be over protective. <br>  Talk to her teachers at school about this issue -- also other moms. Good luck.|`|KjF0p72naa	private schools are much harsher environments for a girl to fit in and stay "in" i did private, public and homeschool. public school may not be "top notch" education wise, but wherever she is, if she applies herself, she wont be sorry. maybe you should encourage her to concenrate on counting her times table instead of counting her number of "friends"<br>  i know you mean well enough-maybe try out some new ideas like art class, a musical instrument, volunteer work, and see if she bites.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Remember this : She will only get one chance to get a quality education, but a lifetime of chances to make friends.

A good counselor. She might not be telling you everything you need to know to make this decision. You could change schools and then nothing would be different. It's very difficult to teach teens how to handle the behavior of other teens. Have you talked to the teachers to see if they notice any type of behavior she is exhibiting to get this treatment? I don't mean to blame her. I know when I was in school I got picked on horribly...I was the wrong religion, the wrong social and economic class and well, I just wasn't interested in playing the same games. It took me to my 11th year to realize that I didn't care what anyone thought of me and then I became more incorporated in my class among all sorts of different cliques.|`|HirjMIoTaa	I would look into sending her to public school. She would enjoy it more there, because there will be many other girls that will make friends with her.

She maybe just a little shy but having an environment of many playful girls will help her adjust from being shy to cheerful and active.|`|9XPnFfaNaa	It seems that as a parent, you have over-estimated the value of an expensive education. I am 16 and go to a public school that offers IB, which is like a super smart program that is respected world wide. I think you need to open your eyes and see that private schooling is highly over-rated. In fact, private school can be hurtful, especially if your daughter isn't equipped with the social skills to make it in such a stuck up community.<br>  <br>  This is what I advise, though you may disagree with me. Let your daughter go to public school for at least a YEAR. This will give her time to adjust and make friends. Encourage her to join after school in-school activities like sports or clubs, because in a public school, making friends is a certainty.<br>  <br>  One thing parents like to forget, school is half book education, half social education. School is meant to teach children how to function in society, and even the smartest people on earth need that skill.|`|IOqM3fHtaa	my sister is a 7th and 8th grade teacher in a public school and her girls do that to one of the other girls there. so no matter where she goes things like that can happen. girls are not that nice at that age. if the school is good and you want to keep her there get her involved in something like a club team from a ymca, dance or something like that. she would meet other girls and it would not be a big deal. other wie put her in public school there are more girls and more "clicks" im sure she would fit in somewhere. and teachers are not that bad.|`|g7T5jox1aa	The question is is it bad enough that she wants to change schools?   middle school is hard enough trying to figure out who you are with out other people making life harder. If it is affecting her esteem, it may be worth it to talk to her about looking into different schools. <br>       I am a senior in high school and i had a really hard time in middle school, after entering high school i found that it became a whole lot easier.  this could have been because all of our middle schools joined together. so maybe a class with more people would take off some social pressure, but on the flip side there is less one on one attention. <br>      I hope this helped some.

8BSiXsO7aa	You definitely have to approach cautiously.  I think you should first talk to her about your differences, letting her know that you didn't feel like she does now when you were 17, etc.  Try not to be too "momish" and come off as a know-it-all.  I think you should be honest with her that this is a wonderful opportunity for her, but it won't be there forever.  You should also point out that if her boyfriend is very serious about her, they will be able to strengthen their relationship even when she's in college.  I think if you really tell her how things will be in the short-term, it might help her understand.  Teens don't understand long-term consequences, which is why they make bad decisions.  Therefore, you can't talk to her in terms of the rest of her life--you have to stay in the near future.|`|kG9oI68eaa	Well I am 19 and I kind of know how that situation go's.  From what you have said about their relationship it doesn't seem to be an extremely long one.  One month isn't too long and not usually long enough to fall in love.  Not that she has to be in love with him to follow him but she needs to understand the possible outcomes of the situation.  I am sure she knows how important education is and will be in the future.  I think as long as she knows this and is able to do well in school you should let her do what she needs to do.  Hearing "you can't" or "stop dating him" not only hurts you feelings, makes you resent your parents, but also makes you want to do it even more.  I would simply explain what you expect from her and then make sure you let her know you support her and love her (do in sincerely).|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You need to sit your daughter down and have a talk with her... explain what the stakes are... that you refuse to be drowning in $60 of debt if she refuses to take college seriously. Get a firm commitment from her on this or withdraw the financing deal.<br>  <br>  Yes, I agree, if she is so distracted by the BF, she really should try working for a while, and perhaps knock down a few core courses in community college while she is chasing the BF. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to your daughter about this "living together" with her BF... it never works out. Look at the pages of Yahoo Answers if you need confirmation. The girl invariably winds up giving the BF the full services of a wife, and he just takes it. With sex invariably comes pregnancy, and the likelihood of having to sue him for child support because things got out of hand before he was ready for the commitment. You should only move in with your guy after an engagement is announced and a wedding date is set... and that is primarily to set up housekeeping.<br>  <br>  The controlling behavior is a red flag. You need to print out Dear Abby's "Warning Signs of an Abusive Personality" for your daughter and go over it all point by point. Abuse starts small and subtle, but goes from little digs to big insults, and from little pushes to roundhouse punches. Black eyes can become permanent. <br>  <br>  I found the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/index.html?uc_full_date=20000118" rel="nofollow">http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/index.h...</a>|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Why would you pull the plug if you want this for her?

IF you want another ring, then choose a complete different setting that the one it's now in.  OR you could have a necklace or bracelet also made from it.  If you do like jewelery, there are many things  you could have done to it to completely change it.  IF you need the money, you could pawn it, but you'll NEVER get the true value out of it.  There are just too many things that could be done w/it.  NO, I would NOT even think of returning it to him in any way.  You would NOT want to get him involved in his past for hurt to his future.  There are just too many options for you to choose to do.  Would you want to be the wife to suddenly have an engagement ring turn up in your life at this stage of the game?

t0PzSCs0aa	i think that you should try and talk to him. see what page he is on and what he plans to do in the future. tell him how you feel, as well as your apprehension. tell him you wont stand for him cheating on you if you guys do end up dating.<br>  <br>  communication works wonders. go for it.|`|kiY9kihbaa	Don't go any further with him until he talks to his girlfriend and breaks up with her.  I can be judgemental of him still right?  Sounds like he has no courage.  He wants to be with you, but afraid of letting his other girlfriend go until it's a sure thing with you.  OR he just wants a fling with you and wants to stick with his old girlfriend.  <br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you not to give it a try, just telling you it probably won't work out and you'll probably be hurt by it.  You take responsibility for your actions.  Don't allow him to cheat on his girlfriend.  If he seriously advances towards you, tell him he has to talk to his girlfriend and break it off with her first.  Consider how you would feel if your boyfriend was getting some on the side.<br>  <br>  I won't be judgemental until you do something worth criticizing.  You are right to question right to do, and I don't blame you for wanting something with him.  But, be careful what you do from here on out.|`|huUUzF7Xaa	Well you should talk to him, find out what he thinks, does he like you? Does he want a relationship? If he does tell him how you feel, but don't be the other woman, don't hook up with him if he's with her because it's not fair to her. I know you like him, but you can't let him get to you.|`|y1LTfhEAaa	Being the other woman sucks, but at least you knew about her, and hooked up with him anyway. First off, my advice to him would be if he's not in a fulfilling relationship then he should end it. Of course he would say that to you to get into your pants. Even though you feel like you have fallen for him, build a ladder and get back up, because if he wants to pursue things with you, then he needs to get rid of her. Make him do the work to get you back. And if he stays with her, then obviously he's not worth it to you. Good luck!
naequcqlaa	He is one sick person is exactly what he is.  I too well know, have been there!  His own life for some reason is filled w/anger that he inflicts it on others.  He does need serious help.  Somewhere down the line he too was abused & 9 times out of 10, from a family member.  Also, 9 times out of 10 it was on his mother's side of the family.  He's striking back the only way he knows how, & that's by hurting others!  You no doubt are a very loving understanding person yourself, & this is why you have the feelings of feeling sorry for him regardless of all he's done against you.  I'm a loving caring type person too, BUT, I've been mentally AND physically abused by someone who was badly abused by his mother. The sad part of it is that he could have gotten help for this yrs. ago & would have been able to set himself free,  But no, he choose NOT to, broke up one marriage & I've now been w/him for a good number of yrs. I'm retired now & do NOT have the funds to go elsewhere, so take this emotional abuse almost on a daily routine after he drinks all day, every day & comes in at dinner time & takes everything out on me.  We split up one time on a domestic violence issue for 9 mos., but I "tho't" he'd changed.  WRONG, he didn't.  He no longer physically abuses me, but does emotionally which DOES hurt badly.  I AM a Christian, & just ask for God's help to get me thru this on an almost daily basis.  My 3 children know him & what he's capable of doing, but I do NOT want to worry them, so don't tell them  things I KNOW would just upset them.  I KNOW he loves me, but when he's drunk, that all goes out the window.  Yes, in a way I feel sorry for him that he lives such a miserable life, ut after 18 yrs. of it, I'm more inclined to resent things many times.  I can understand where you're coming from tho. IF there's any CHANCE of him getting professional help, I KNOW it would be of help to him. On the domestic violence issue, he was court ordered to attend anger management, but from some of the things he's said about it, the person in change was very poorly suited for that position & did more harm than good.  I was so tempted to say something to the court about this issue as I do not feel this person should have had the position of helping people but instead turned them against it & actually made a mockery of it all.  I truly can sympathize w/you tho..Take good care of YOU...:)|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	You suffer battered wife syndrome. In lay terms, this is a reference to any person who, because of constant and severe domestic violence usually involving physical abuse by a partner, becomes depressed and unable to take any independent action that would allow her to escape the abuse. The condition explains why abused people often do not seek assistance from others, fight their abuser, or leave the abusive situation. Sufferers have low self-esteem, and often believe that the abuse is their fault. Such persons usually refuse to press criminal charges against their abuser, and refuse all offers of help, often becoming aggressive or abusive to others who attempt to offer assistance. Often sufferers will even seek out their very abuser for comfort shortly after an incident of abuse.|`|7wdooasKaa	My mother actually had gone through two marriages with guys that were abusive and just like you she felt bad for them.

You have to admit this is great advice from a 10yr. old|`|zikdyuC4aa	take one of those things that yall have in common ( that is an activity ) and ask her if she would like to hang out... sometimes face to face can be very nerve wrecking, so if you have her #, txt her. its sooooo much easier that way|`|StrOvZp6aa	say wats up and tell her compliments and ask her if u guys could be friends and tell her more compliments|`|ySeiM8Wwaa	comment on her hair or something. i am a girl|`|bZLW4IJXaa	First of all just say hello. It's an easy starter. If you have things in common bring one of those things up. If you share a class with her, you should try to bring something up about that class, maybe ask about the homework or talk about something you think is cool about that class.<br>   If your the shy type, just say hi and complement something about her. Complement's go along way with girls, and when said sincerely girl's love them. <br>  Just don't be afraid to say hello, and if you want to ask her out, just ask in a sweet way. Like, "I think you're a really amazing girl and I was wondering if you would go out with me?"<br>  <br>  Don't rush things, that's the most important piece of advice I can give you. Take your time and if things don't work out, you'll know it's because it was meant to be that way not because it was something that was rushed.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	1.

And she wants to grant him immediate access?  Holy crap.  If he wants visitation, he's going to have to go to court to get it.  You'd be crazy to allow him anywhere near this child.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	She needs legal advice, now. No judge would support this choice until 'he' has proven himself. She has a legal and moral duty of care to protect her. Failure to protect her daughter could have dire consequences for her.|`|mCM363I9aa	I understand you care for both your wife and your stepchild but ultimately you should not be involved in this. It should be your wives decision and you should not be telling her what you think is right or wrong.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	it's not your decision.|`|AA10961538	well time will tell and keeping his daughter away from him may be the one thing that sends him totally over the edge I would let him have supervised visits at the police station and from there at a restaurants this way he won't feel that you are the enemy and fair is fair after all do you want to use this poor child as a weapon or as a human being she has a father maybe not a very smart person to be sure but you knew the deal going into this relationship and if you didn't then maybe you should be thinking about this if I were in his shoes would I really want somebody to take my child totally away from me forever even when I was young dumb and made one heck of allot of mistakes just be thankful you are not dealing with this mans problems he has been punished and if he hasn't had enough punishment then tell him point blank that if you or your wife girlfriend or live in even think he is back into that life style he will never get visitation rights again you will go through the courts and make sure it doesn't happen again. He has one chance and it's the only one your willing to give him so he better not screw it up or he is going to be one very lonely father! Its a strange thing about drugs it is a very horrible life and sometimes your so strung out so very far out there that you honestly don't realize you not only are hurting your self but those who love you the most|`|T02BJJGjaa	Your wife must be the one that just asked the same question only she didn't say she was married again!   You have every right to be concerned, and I'll tell you the same as I told her.   He has a right to see his child, BUT I would not let him see her alone.   I would make sure that if he wanted to see the child that you and your wife are present.   As time goes on you can demand that he be drug tested if you feel he is using.   This calls for very, very close supervision but please keep in mind that he has a right to see his daughter and you have a right to make sure he is living a good life clean of drugs etc.   Good luck and use good judgment at all times.|`|3iNobwVraa	Oh my.<br>  <br>  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  I would not allow unmonitored visitation, until I was very certain all was stable.  I do NOT take chances with my child.  Period.  I wouldn't keep a father/daughter from each other, though.  That's inexcusable.  But the main focus HAS TO BE looking out for the child.  Adults can get mad, *****, or whine, but too bad.  The child must be protected.  How old?  Golly.  What a horrible situation.  I cannot imagine.|`|EQh9GZpXaa	He should be allowed to see his daughter but I totaly agree with you you should make sure he proves that he is ready to see her when he proves himself, dont expose her to him before that.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I kind of agree, but why not at first have supervised visits.

8a3gbCbKaa	You are stuck between a rock & a hard place. All you can really do is think what's best for you. It'll be hard to let one go, but you can't dwell on someone else while your with another person. Maybe what's best is being single for a while. Wait and see how you feel about not being with either one, and then figure things out. Don't completely break up with your current boyfriend, just tell him you need a break to think things through. If he takes it as a bad thing, then he doesn't understand how important it is to figure things out, and he probably isn't worth the trouble then. Hope I helped!

PEfoyysyaa	Hi Melissa,<br>  <br>  I know this is very difficult, but have you read up on all the signs of a cheating husband? You need to be absolutely sure of yourself because once you pursue this, it will be the most difficult thing you would have ever done in your life.<br>  <br>  When or IF you find out you have a cheating husband, it will feel so bad I could only compare it as having a car dropped on you. It's like your whole world suddenly makes no sense upon finding out you have a cheating husband. I speak from experience, when I found out my husband was cheating my whole world flipped. We were together since we were in highschool. I felt betrayed and deceived when I found out about his secret relationship. He was having an affair.<br>  <br>  At that time there were no guides on how to catch a cheating husband, but since then I have found several.<br>  <br>  It might help if you read this guide on how to catch a cheating husband using keyloggers. It will show you methods on how you can view his text messages too, even the deleted text messages. I tried all those things except for the one that involved listening in on his calls, I must say the reading of text messages, even those deleted, was really helpful even after I caught my husband cheating (used it for monitoring my kid's activities online)<br>  <br>  The keylogger article found on that site will also guide you in picking out, and installing a keylogger to monitor your personal computer.<br>  <br>  The guide I am talking about is at: <a href="http://howtocatchacheatinghusband.blogspot.com/2009/01/how-to-catch-cheating-husband.html" rel="nofollow">http://howtocatchacheatinghusband.blogsp...</a>|`|GUmZuVFRaa	Install a keylogger on the computer. So then you can get all his email passwords.<br>  <br>  Then login into his account and see who hes been talking to. It can also grab his facebook login/password if he has one.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	Trust him until you have proof my wife trust me but she's kind of on the dim side
GUXOxiGiaa	yeah right! As if you can never tell you friend! What on earth who ever is stn1225. Duh you can tell but as well you need to show her that you mean it. The way you can tell her is just being a bit firm with her. Like tell her to get a grip since you are serious about this not joking around. No, this doesn't mean that you be mean to her. You're just showing her that you really mean it by telling her and showing her at school.<br>  <br>  Try it! Gud luck!|`|c1e077ca88966e8fba4354709743a0bfaa	You can never tell her those things, she will never believe you.<br>  <br>  You have to show her.<br>  <br>  When the time comes, don't ask her. Sit with her at lunch, hang out after school, do all the things you usually do as friends. Ignore he complaining and eventually she will realize you are choosing her over popularity.
l44FgbYKaa	the only thing guys are trying to get in is in between your legs and not in between your toes. let him pound you till ya moan|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Guys like women, all their pieces and parts.<br>  <br>  Toes are often covered, guys don't get to see them often.  It's natural to look at something you don't see often.<br>  <br>  Open toed shoes make the woman just slightly more naked then normal shoes, so that is a plus.<br>  <br>  And some guys just like toes<br>  <br>  Of course this only goes for women with nice feet, and women that take care of there feet and all.|`|AA11155064	You mean women wear shoes?<br>  When did this start happening?<br>  And there's open-toed types .....are there other types too?<br>  GOLLY... this is a lot to take in!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, beyond fetishers, shoes are only important as fascinations to women themselves.<br>  To many guys, women's footwear can be classified as follows:<br>   -- flat, sensible and comfortable -- shows low maintenance, sensible and comfortable company,<br>   -- "clompers" that make loud clomping noises when walking -- shows inconsideration for others and need for attention,<br>   -- high heels -- show high maintenance/ status/ aspirations<br>   -- clogs/ very high heels/ plastic -- trashy/ insincere/ fad addict/ air head.<br>   -- FMBs (ankle/ shin/ thigh length boots) -- the longer, the greater the promise ..but no guarantee of delivery.<br>  <br>  Normally it is a nono-second appraisal that doesn't warrant the extremes of time, consideration and monetary expense that women accord it.<br>  <br>  But..... if it makes women happy to accumulate shoe collections, let them do so and be happy. <br>  Just don't expect all guys to be on the same page with your commitment however.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	Not a fan of open toed shoes necessarily but anything with a heel does it for me, just makes legs look so much better. The higher, the better ;)<br>  <br>  Flat soles suck. Make women look ungainly and frumpy, traits which are not exactly at the top of my wish list for the perfect woman.|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Because most men love to see dazzling feet.  The feet/ toes are usually the area most girls do not care about.  Well they do but dont realize how bad they look.  By keeping up with them to me they look cuter.  Not because of the toes but because I know they take care of themselves.|`|2Dpg3jKyaa	Learn the word "Fetish" (:<br>  <br>  Also, beautiful toes = beautiful legs. haha, thats also a  Fetish|`|4PdcTUCQaa	if theyre wearing toenail polish and whatnot|`|AA10640653	I don't really care about the shoes as much as I do about a girl having nice toes. <br>  <br>  I do love when women wear flip flops, sandals open toe heels and such, yeah, I find it sexy but not on every pair of female feet.|`|4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	I don't think guys could care less. Men want to be with a woman who looks good and dresses nice, but could care less if she's wearing sandals, ballet flats, or sneakers.|`|72895a389b784432eea922187fc22a83aa	Basically I think guys don't give a rip either way.  Their main objective is to get to what is between your two big toes.|`|AA11296241	foot fetish<br>  also, if a girl can take care of her feet, then she takes care of herself - thats who you want - not a slob.|`|yJek3Pwyaa	guys don't give a sh*t what kinda shoe a girl wears|`|D9iE2JBKaa	meh|`|USsjb7YLaa	only is they have pretty feet or toes w/e its ok|`|b02c7e5de4d776df907cfafdabdbc62eaa	I do, because I like woman's feet, end of story.<br>  <br>  If they are taken care of correctly, they can be admired in open-toed shoes.|`|pOmjcVjZaa	Well, I honestly don't think a guy would care about shoes. All they care about is boobs and getting in the girl's pants.
LsFihE9iaa	sweetie you might just be over reacting... a tadd bit. I'm sure he didn't forget about it. but it wouldn't hurt to kall him up a few days before the day to see what his parents said and see if he's still komming. but don't sound desperate just ask him if his plans khanged in the kourse of the week. if he's as excited about the night as you are then he'll be there|`|AA11044762	you never even said how long he is taking to get back with you
DaurttTJaa	Well it sounds to me like he does like you, but you said that you found out something about him that made you like him alot less, but did you ever ask him about what you heard to see if it was true or not? Also, you were talking/flirting with another guy, you know he saw that, and I am sure it hurt his feelings, so to hurt you too, he started flirting with another girl, because you stopped talking to him, and you stopped flirting with him, so how is he suppose to know if you still like him or not?|`|0lQtTE9Daa	he still likes you. he likes you more now because your a challenge to get and its human nature to want what you cant have. if you like him you better let him know soon cus eventually he will just give up. also keep in mind that if he really likes you hes probably sad and angry that you seem to be ignoring him, so just try to be at least friends with him.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	its a mind game|`|AA10990828	First apparently he likes you, second you said you don't like him. So now that you are disinterested he is going to do just what he is doing, trying to make you jealous don't fall for it. If you don't like him for whatever reason don't go back on it, it shows a sign of weakness and he already knows your not into him anymore he will just act like a tool once you get him.|`|PFidHqNfaa	he likes u and is trying to get u jelouse|`|WoQBsgBcaa	yup|`|dlHg3r1Vaa	ha. He definitely wants you. :)|`|9syEUfnqaa	aww this is so cute..well the reason why he's with another girl flirting with her is because hes trying to make you jealous, and he gets jealous everytime he sees you with another guy..and its true that if you like him, then you become more attractive to him..so he likes you alott. give him a chance. whatever this thing is, you shouldn't let it get in the way.|`|MjKnYm1baa	ummmmm.. he totally likes you. Him talking to another girl is just trying to make you pay attention to him and make you kinda jealous.|`|hjViDMAEaa	This sounds spooky and stalkish. But if he likes you, he should have the guts to come by and ask you out.|`|lTsONvwQaa	If you dont like him then why do you care who he talks to? Just leave him alone.|`|nRT7sPXQaa	This question is the epitome of why I hate most of my peers.|`|HzYPGgGjaa	its jealousey try asking him if he would like to go to the movies.or ask him out someone.follow ur heart and give it a chance......after all he prob does like you an hes trying to make u jealouse|`|D9iE2JBKaa	................................|`|sfsQooKeaa	he likes you..i think :]|`|oBhC7kAuaa	okay, this is not that difficult to understand...<br>  <br>  you liked him, you told him<br>  he told you he liked you <br>  you stopped talking to him so understandably hes like WTF<br>  so hes trying to figure out what youre thinking<br>  and when you start flirting with another guy he doesnt want to seem like hes still hung up on you when youve moved on so he counters with flirting with someone else|`|kHs0SFctaa	Well it seems like he likes you but he doesn't know how to tell you or maybe he's kinda shy. In my opinion it seems like he's just making you jealous by talking to another girl cause he saw you talking to another guy and it bothered him, but if he really wants you, he'll run after you. =)|`|V5gELuFOaa	First he stares at you because he knows you like him. However since he does not know you like him less he will continue to look at you the same. The only reason why he talked to that other girl is because he was trying to make you jealous since he felt threatened that you were talking to someone else. just boys playing games so don't give him another minute of your time.|`|AA12300280	Well if you're absolutely sure he was looking at you, sounds like this guy has some feminine qualities.  He was trying to make you jealous by talking to another girl.  As long as you were sure he was looking at you all those times. Then yop.  He was trying to make you jealous.  And if you took the time to write all that, sounds like you still like him a little bit.|`|EgqCLBwBaa	He most defenatly likes you. If he started to talk to another girl after he saw you talk to that one guy then he is just trying to make you jelous. Now the only problem is, is, do you still like him. Hahaha, I hope i helped!|`|3Pv32FxVaa	well he was definitely jealous when you started talking to the other guy. its high school and, i know this is isnt the desired answer, i wouldnt worry about it too much because in reality, will it really ever go anywhere?|`|46nNeX1xaa	HE either really cares about you alot or is jelou.<br>  ask him how he feels and tell him your serious if he like another girl then let him be your obviously not right for him then|`|4b0af5311f2d55ba03672ac9a75178b8aa	because you said you liked him, he began paying attention to you. now he likes you and can't get over you. so, yes. trust me on this one.|`|rEs4Y5Niaa	oh he's obviously jealous!!! he likes you! howcome when you told him you liked him you guys didnt go out? <br>  if you really dont like him anymore just dont mind anything he does... he doesnt matter|`|PZ0o5ZDraa	It sounds like this boy is trying to make you jealous. It seems like he likes you.|`|Rbn8ouKxaa	Oo yehh.  You made him really jealous.  Now he's trying to make you jealous.  He's playing the game he thinks your trying to play.|`|urrrmbWoaa	he likes you. he was pry just jelous that you were talking to another guy so he wanted to try and show off make you jelous|`|kMesQjEDaa	um u should of done what he did went over and talked to him strike up a conversation, or before u do that if he starts all that starring stuff again stair back at him and smile then work your way towards him and say hi or something|`|tuCSJDEuaa	He likes u can u give me advice on mine abt me and my grl|`|GRegSLA4aa	Well I think he might like you, but that depends on wat yu heard about him; if he is a player then, no he is just playin lol But if he stares maybe he does sort of like you... but faking to like people isn't easy, so I wouldn't think he's fakin...  He's jealous so he flist with others too. = ] <br>  <br>  dont be angry at him, boys were born that way = ] yu know... confused (to put it nicely. I just fell on my face one too mny times so my insanity has a reason: love is insanity too did yu know that?)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  **I don't know why people now a days think that flirting is a slutty, whoreish thing to do, you shouldn't need to tell us that you aren't a whore :/ Those who thought so, need a dictionary and fast [So do i, my spellin is crap lol ]|`|5C6YHAWtaa	Yes he does like you. Since you looked over at him and made eye contact with him, but remained with the other guy he saw that you would rather talk to that guy then be with him so he went to another girl. You need to make up your mind about whether this thing you found out about him is worth not persueing a relationship or asking him out sometime.|`|wIyizXtyaa	i think he likes you and was jealous when you were flirting with the other guy and decided to flirt with a girl to get you to notice or something. Then again he may not have liked you but when you started loosing interest he probably kinda didn't like that cause he was showing off that a girl liked him so if you stop it won't be good for his reputation. i guess lol...good luck|`|mBmwA4lIaa	Honestly he prolly doesn't like u..he's juss one of those guys that when a girl tells a guy that she likes him..he gets gased and likes the fact that a girl likes him and she gives him all the attention...but now that u haven't been payin attention it brings him off his high horse and feels threatend that ur liking another guy..so he juss wants that attention again..which is why now he's trying to get ur attention..again...|`|kpqTiTalaa	maybe yes but maybe no. you make he jaleous and he make you too. i think just one game in love.. you must try to say love to him if you not want to lose his love.. except justt for love and not to have his love..|`|vLEClcJtaa	Lol thats happened 2 me 2.. im 14... HEs really Jealous thats y...<br>  i get like that all the time when the girl i like is flirting with sum one.....<br>  Becuz he really LIKES U and wants 2 make u jealous 2|`|StrOvZp6aa	he defintly likes you and he was trying to get ur attention and wat was the thing that made you like him alot less
T3b4I4kXaa	It sounds like you got bored and need a change.<br>  Ask for one for your birthday. <br>  They are not all that expensive. <br>  WalMart has some good beginner's guitars. <br>  You can probably find a nice one at a pawn shop because people are getting rid of stuff they don't use every day.|`|Xa3btVV2aa	weit for some time till  d economy has been set righted. as there r many days further where u can full fill ur aim. try to understand ur parents man (economy)|`|tiQ4IHQAaa	I hate my guitar.Its extremely boring and hard when you start off at first.I got my guitar on my 15th birthday and i just turned 17 a few weeks ago and mine is dead in the corner of my room.Its so hard to sit in one spot for hours and hours and learn it..but maybe that was because i never really wanted one..i always wanted drums and my parents  bought me a dumb guitar!<br>  :(<br>  ill get my drums soon though so yayyers!
woEoXfaZaa	You should show her this.  If my children cared enough about me to go to this trouble it would make me so happy.<br>  <br>  Beside that ask her how you could help.  If you want to do a one of special thing as a thank you and I love you one night when she comes home run her a bath with candles, relaxation music and aromatherapy,  then when she gets out have dinner cooked and serve with a glass of wine.  After dinner you could give her a foot massage and then tell her to go to bed and clean up.  That would make any mum feel special :)  Good luck you are such a lovely daughter.|`|DP3rQkrtaa	take her to the spa or give her a massage or a facial. Something that will relax her or you could buy her a present.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	wow what a teenager she is a lucky woman|`|AA11280073	Why don't you fix dinner for her and do some household chores to help her out? You could fold the laundry, dust, sweep the floor, keep your room tidy and do the wash. It would be less work for her.<br>  You sound like a wonderful daughter.|`|7b41e58a21eefd3df561dd1d0510e173aa	-do well in your academics<br>  -help out with the house chores<br>  -spend Maximum with her<br>  -cook for her if you can :)<br>  -give her surprises. eg.candle light dinner, redo her room, arrange her closet etc|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	Make dinner. Ask her about her day. Show interest in her life.
yzrvnDusaa	I say invite them, they may not be able to come, but they know that you were thinking of them. =] and if it was in the country, they might feel like u wouldnt invite them then. and No its not rude to invite them when they might not be able to come, thats only rude if ur A mean very rich person. then its rude =] but i doubt thats u. Congrads! and goodluck!|`|nGkCWpRVaa	you should invite them|`|Yu7y6yfraa	If they are special friends, definitley invite them.  Just, give them an easy out.  You might even include a small note in their invitation stating that you will understand if they cannot make it since it requires a trip out of town; but, you wanted to make sure they knew how imporant they were to you. <br>  <br>  You don't have to mention anything else.  These day, few people can afford to go off on a wedding trip when their friends get married.  <br>  <br>  This is a bit like when anyone in my family graduates from school or gets married.  They know I cannot fly back to TN from CA; but, they want to make sure I know how important I am to them.  I would problaby be a little hurt if I did not get those special invitations.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	Tell your fiance that not only does an invitation not taunt them, but not being invited tells them "we don't want you there, you're icky and not worth inviting".<br>  <br>  Nobody over the age of nine feels taunted by receiving an invitation to a wedding they can't afford to attend. Most people receive at least two or three wedding invitations a year, and very few can attend all of them. It is a fact of adult life that everyone recognizes and understands. It is however extremely common for family and friends to be terribly hurt if they don't receive an invitation, even if there is no way on Earth they can attend. It's the thought that you would want them there.<br>  <br>  Your fiance is so much in the wrong that he's going to inadvertently devastate many people in his misguided attempt not to hurt a few.|`|2Av3gIqgaa	If they are close friends or close family, then its rude not to invite them and you are right.  <br>  <br>  If you don't invite them, they wonder WHY you didn't.  If you do invite them, then at least they get the option of declining.  Who knows, maybe they even would want to come to the wedding so badly that they would find some way to be there.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if they are merely acquaintances, co-workers, or distant family, it would be rude to invite them since you know they would not be able to come.  If this is the case, I would send them an announcement after the wedding instead.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	invite them anyway, they will appreciate the thought even if they are unable to attend the wedding. it's more rude to not invite them because they will think you didnt care enough to invite them even if you knew they wouldnt be able to attend, down the road it could cause problems cause they could remember not being invited and not invite you out of spite.|`|5OLj2qpbaa	Some people in this situation will have a 'reception' within a few week of returning to your hometown. This will give those who cannot afford to attend your nuptials to share in the joy of your union.|`|7WbehQZjaa	I would invite all the people you would enjoy having at your wedding. It's their decision whether to come or not, and I would openly tell them that there is no pressure, but that if they would like to join you, you'd love it. It would be rude and cause hurt feelings if you don't. My best friend's sister had a destination wedding and didn't invite her family at all, including parents, because they knew they couldn't afford it, and my friend still has hurt feelings over it. If you have decided and booked already and have plenty of time, invite them now, so that they have time to save to come. If very few people can come with you, it's kind of the new thing to throw a reception party within a few months of getting married so everyone can formally congratulate you and spend time with the "bride and groom".|`|94e9881aaf81b5bc826d9d1e78bfe375aa	I personally think you have to invite them.  Let them know that you want them there at least.  Destination weddings are becoming more and more common that recipients appreciate the thought of the invitation even though most of them won't be able to make it.  And for the most part, most of them know you don't expect them to show up.  It's more of a courtesy thing. Good Luck and all the best!!|`|pcQi36h7aa	Just do immediate family. It may not be a huge shabang because people probably can't afford it either way of being invited, or not being invited. You can find places that bundle things for a decent price too, like a in Tennesee, there's places that charge 400 for the whole thing and you get like 10 guests. Anybody over the 10 has to pay their own way, or have it paid for them..|`|vqEaTmU2aa	That's the problem when you have a wedding really far away. My sister did, and no one except my immediate family came to her wedding.<br>  <br>  But regardless, I think who you are closest to should take precedence over who could pay for the wedding, so you should pay for them. If you can't afford to pay for them yourself, try and get some help from your parents if they are in the picture.<br>  <br>  These are my suggestions. But obviously it is a difficult situation. Good luck though!|`|vyL7yEleaa	it's mainly out of courtesy, it shows that you remembered them even if they can't make it. my fiance's grandparents can't come because his grandpa can't travel but we are still sending them an invitation to show them that we remembered them.|`|y9rP2tWHaa	it might be hurtful if you dont invite them they might feel left out go ahead and invite them if they cant go then they cant but its always nice to be thought of and know that they are invited to be there on your special day
StrOvZp6aa	you should be flirting with other guys and then flirt with him and ask him who he is going to the dance with and see were things go from there|`|AA11296241	ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY - do not pursue it|`|gAflmxDRaa	ask him if he would want to try to get bac togethr again, if he says yea, thts gr8. if he says no, then just ask if he would like to go to the dance then, mayb just as friends. if the nite goes off without any prob, ask if you want to go further from tht and be gf and bf? idk, im feeling mixed up   recently
fc9d4ARVaa	YES. I am so proud of you for feeling guilty and knowing what the right thing to do is. It'll seem like the hardest thing to do, but just tell her the absolute truth, not leaving anything out. Like the "not even making out" part too. I opened this question prepared to hate you completely, but I'm happy that some guys are human.<br>  And she has the right to know, imagine if she did that to you, and she never told you? That'd make me angrier than the actual cheating part.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Tell her - extreme result:  lose her  <br>                  Lesser result:    Relationship changes forever<br>  Keep your mouth shut  -   extreme result: live happily ever aft<br>                                   Lesser result - live happily ever after  <br>  Ten years from now - she finds out - "honey, your're asking me about a girl I can't remember from ten years ago" "I can't even remember someone I met last year" Deny, Deny, Deny.  You've got the whole time lapse thing on your side.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	By not lying and tell her the absolute truth.<br>  <br>  Never lie to a girl.|`|ae73541672d371e87ebedfb3fa8b29f0aa	Tell her, explain the situation, she may not forgive you at first, let time heal her pain.  you will risk the chance of loosing her.  But if she finds out any other way you WILL loose her for good.  No woman wants to hear that you kinda cheated from someone else.<br>  Suck it up, be honest with her.<br>  If you love her you will tell her.<br>  If you don't love her, why care?|`|veZLfnGFaa	You've kicked yourself enough - forget it.  If you tell her, she will probably leave you.  Is it worth it?|`|bTLwhwR3aa	You better tell her...<br>  <br>  why would u cheat?|`|N4zrkbrsaa	lmao half the answers say tell her and half say dont tell her...<br>  <br>  Dude in my opinion dont tell her ...just for the reason you felt guilty and knew it was wrong that punishment is enough..now you know for the next time not to do it again..and you were also intoxicated with alcohol and impaired your thinking...people make mistakes your a people you made a mistake and people learn from mistakes so just take this chance and learn from your mistake.<br>  <br>  If you do tell her i hope she atleast knows how good of a guy you are telling this to her but gd luck :)|`|AA10213887	tell her or she will never be able to trust you, its bad what happened but you are human and you made a mistake, tell her the truth and apologize and promise to her that you will never do that any more, you may loose her now, but then again you may not, its always better to be honest, then to have to hide a lie when you see her, tell her. she will respect you more if you are honest. Good luck|`|VbrvE128aa	I hate to be the one to say this but what she dont know wont hurt her...i mean things happen and all you can do is try not to do it again...Because you will be very upset if you tell her and you find out from someone else that she cheated to and didnt tell you..not saying it will happen but its something to think about...Just forget about it and dont do it again|`|qfSKgxDsaa	yep you got to tell her, at least you didn't sleep together, but i dont condone what you did mind you.  but you have to tell her and let her make a decision on what she wants to do.  but if you dont it will eat you up inside|`|fIxzUq5laa	If you tell her then there is a chance that she will brake up with you and she will never be able to trust you again. If I were you I will not say anything but just forget about it.|`|uLHtXibRaa	You can tell her..but that wont guarantee you will get a pat on the back for finally being honest..|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	it depends on the kind of girlfriend she is.if she is understanding tel her if she is not dont|`|gtTg0XOOaa	tell her. you'd want the same.|`|gzlz4i3Naa	you have to tell her. if the situation were reversed, wouldn't you want to know?|`|rEFHlhmdaa	umm no if you know how your girlfriend is going to react and you still want to be with her don't do it. when people tell their significant other they cheated it's always for selfish reason THEY feel bad or THEY would want to know. really think about what your girl would want and which would be better for HER and then you will know.<br>  <br>  oooo and i know that this answer is just inviting thumbs downs lol but it's cool|`|AA11296241	tell her. you would want to know if she did it... Good luck. Reassure her that you did not want to do it and have no intentions of repeating it. she may get mad at you and walk out - be prepared. But eventually she will realize you were honest and could have lied - but did not lie and that will make her realize how good of a man you are!<br>  <br>  Good Luck - hopefully you wont repeat it. <br>  <br>  Remember - its easy to cheat and very easy to lie/hide.|`|S4qLj0CCaa	bro honestly i would not tell her because you seem like a person who wont cheet but you did it because you were wasted.<br>  <br>  when your body is wasted your brain functions under 20 percent so you had no control just forget and never do it again.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	Sounds like you've already hurt yourself in this.  Unless you're concerned that something is missing in your relationship and that's part of what what happened I think it would only be hurting her as well to tell her.|`|P5CLeokmaa	Yes, you should tell her, and its a good thing you tried to avoided her, but you should of left.<br>  <br>  And not let anything happen.<br>  <br>  But it's good thing you didn't get to far.<br>  <br>  Tell her, and be in front of her|`|j5Zm7Rndaa	I dont think you should tell her. It will most likely only bite you in the ***. Just bottle it up inside and make sure it doesnt happen again if you dont want to lose her.|`|xJ2kcJsraa	tell her and be honest about everything.<br>  <br>  that's what makes a healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  i told my ex that sometimes i fvck up. and she doesn't mind at all.|`|mDBHMJPjaa	no don't you will have so much problems don't do it unless your sure she will beable to forgive you|`|EXUC0j9Paa	yes tell her thats the best bet honesty is always the best policy|`|a3bq277Gaa	Your girlfriend has a right to know.<br>  Imagine if she did that with some guy.|`|wHgBnMipaa	I would let her know.  You don't want this hanging over your head forever.|`|lTsONvwQaa	tell her before she finds out from someone else|`|kpPmXyRgaa	just tell yourself that youll never do it again and its all gonna be ok|`|AA11485494	my gawd|`|AAlB49iraa	just let me tell you from experience that if you don't tell her someone else will b/c you were in public, right? and even if you don;t think she'll find out.....she most likely will eventually. even if it is 6 months from now. then she won't really be sure whether or not to believe you when you you say it was nothing and just a kiss or two...because in her mind..."why would he hide it if it was no big deal??? trust me . been there. so you should tell her now, as soon as possible. tell her you got wasted and your judgment was impaired and SWEAR not to do it again. she will appreciate the fact that you couldn't keep this from her and didn't want to build your relationship around this incident that's hanging over your head. Spare her the grinding details. just tell her there was a kiss or two. not a make-out. If you love each other you will get past it ...i did. but when you hide something it makes it seem like a big deal when it comes out.  And here's a little advice. don't go out and get so drunk. When you do that you are asking for trouble. Everybody looks a little better when your drunk and somehow we forget who's the one we really want when we're smashed and just go for who's right here. hope this helps you decide to do the right thing.|`|DwBJGZt3aa	I would tell her. Because if she really loves you she'd look past it, but just make sure you NEVER do it again. And if you do tell her about it, make sure you mention you were drunk & you tried to avoid her & make sure you explain to her how sorry you are & how bad you feel for doing it. If I was her, I'd be happy that you're so guilty about it, that's a sign that you most likely wouldn't cheat on her for real, as in past 1st base lol..|`|5C6YHAWtaa	Definitely tell her. Sit her down in a calm enviroment, like a quiet apartment, and explain the story and emphasize on the points that you were trying to avoid her and tell her that there isn't another girl that you would rather be with. If she senses it or finds out later it will be much worse. After all of this you can just hope for the best.|`|GXhSvW2daa	No no no Do you look for trouble?dont upset your gf now a girl that doesnt know anything its a happy girl and trust me on that, if you tell her she might use it against you or even worse. i know everyone is saying tell her but most of them are girls that are sayen that So i hope you understand what i mean by that.sorry if everone hates me for this LOL|`|YQYZR7I0aa	why did you not boink the girl. than you can worry us about cheating.<br>  <br>  kissing is not cheating. i kiss my friend. that is how we great . my girlfriend know and her boyfriend.<br>  <br>  your auntie still kisses you or you kiss your bother or sisters baby.<br>  <br>  KISSING IS NOT CHEATING.<br>  <br>  boink her and then you can ask me.<br>  <br>  tell your gal you kissed someone at the club and you are not sure who it is. and move on|`|DaurttTJaa	I think that you should tell her, because your relationship needs to be based on trust, and if she were to find this out from someone else, and then you tried to explain that nothing really happened, she would not believe you because you didn't tell her about it to start with.|`|8M4WZ8x5aa	first ask your self this question: If she would had done the same, would you have liked to know? If the answer is yes, then you should tell her. <br>  <br>  If you answered no, then to you it's not a big deal so why tell her. <br>  <br>  But what ever you decide to do, MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN! LoL <br>  <br>  GooD LucK!|`|Px990WYDaa	tell her now. becuz the guilt wont go away. she might take it two ways.<br>  your being honest you were drunk and now your completely sorry and continue being with you orrrrr... shes pissed and leaves you. id get it out the way, because if you two fall in love or your relationship grows.. youll know you werent faithful and your whole relationship is a lie.|`|6AV9XbjCaa	oooooh bad boy lol just kidding<br>  sweetie, you need to let her know<br>  she deserves it<br>  and you dont want that hanging over your head<br>  just explain what happened, and hopefully she'll forgive you<br>  ensure her its NEVER going to happen again<br>  and just be a good boy|`|OE3f12Mkaa	You know what'd be the right thing to do?

Can you carry on living with the guilt of lying to her?<br>  <br>  Sorry to answer a question with three question but I think you get the point.|`|qPrNjUjkaa	TELL HER!!!!! If you don't tell her, you will be forever guilty. Also, if you tell her later on, she probably won't forgive you because you didn't tell her right away. If you tell her now, she'll respect you more for coming clean from the get go.|`|StrOvZp6aa	i think you should tell her and that the girl was staking you and then say tha you were so drunk and tell her that it was all her fault she kissed you first and then that she kept kissing you  but i dont think you should tell her because she will kill you virginia m 11 turning 12|`|knn3dbMxaa	IF U REALY LUV UR GF, U MUST TEL HER, HOW WOULD U FEEL IF U WER IN PLACE OF UR GF, N GF IN URS. . . . . .

You're going to loose her forever if you do tell her. Besides it's not THAT big, but i understand that you feel guilty.. <br>  But now that you know how guilty you feel and how bad it feels like to cheat on someone, im sure you wouldn't do it again, right?<br>  But even if it does slip out and you do tell her, She would most likely either<br>  1. spazz out on you<br>  2. cry<br>  3. dump you on the spot.<br>  shes going to ask you Why you did it, and if i were you i would tell her the true story about being drunk. She might not believe you, and would probably think it's an excuse. Try to be totally honest about everything that happened. You COULD leave out the kissing part though, and just say u were grinding. Although you might loose her trust on you for a while...

Und was ihr für einen anderen tut, das tut ihr für das Selbst.<br>  Dies deshalb, weil ihr und der andere eins seid.<br>  Und das ist deshalb so, weil…. da nichts ist au?er euch.<br>  <br>  (Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch: Was ihr für den geringsten meiner <br>  Brüder getan habt, das habt ihr mir getan). Doch das ist für die meisten <br>  Menschen lediglich eine gro?e esoterische Wahrheit geblieben mit einer <br>  ?u?erst geringe praktische Anwendungsm?glichkeit. <br>  <br>  Also mu? ich nicht die ewige duldsame Ehefrau oder der herabgesetzte<br>  Ehemann oder das Opfer in meinen Beziehungen sein, um zu etwas Heiligem zu werden oder mich in den Augen Gottes wohlgef?llig erscheinen zu lassen?<br>  <br>  Gott: Aber natürlich nicht.<br>  <br>  Und ich mu? mir nicht die Attacken auf meine Würde, die Angriffe auf <br>  meinen Stolz, die Besch?digungen meiner Psyche und die Verwundung meines Herzens bieten lassen, um sagen zu k?nnen, da? ich in einer Beziehung mein Bestes gegeben, in den Augen Gottes und der Menschen meine Pflicht getan oder meiner Verpflichtung erfüllt habe?<br>  <br>  Gott: Nicht eine Minute lang.<br>  <br>  Dann sag mir bitte, welche Versprechen ich in einer Beziehung geben sollte, welche Vereinbarungen mu? ich einhalten? Welche Verpflichtungen<br>  bringt eine Beziehung mit sich? An welche Richtlinien sollte ich mich halten?<br>  <br>  Gott: Die Antwort ist eine unh?rbare – denn sie l??t dich ohne Richtlinien,<br>  macht jede Vereinbarung in dem Moment, in dem du sie triffst, null und nichtig. Die Antwort lautet: Du hast keine Verpflichtung – weder in einer Beziehung noch in deinem ganzen Leben.<br>  <br>  Keine Verpflichtung?<br>  <br>  Gott: Keine Verpflichtung. Ebenso keinerlei Beschr?nkungen oder Begrenzungen, keine Richtlinien oder Regeln. Du bist auch nicht durch irgendwelche Umst?nde oder Situationen gebunden, nicht eingeschr?nkt<br>  durch irgendeinen Kodex oder Gesetz. Au?erdem bist du nicht für irgendeine Ungeh?rigkeit zu bestrafen, noch irgendeiner Ungeh?rigkeit f?hig – denn in den Augen Gottes gibt es nichts Ungeh?riges.<br>  Ihr k?nnt nicht an eine Beziehung ohne Verpflichtung glauben, weil ihr das, <br>  wer und was ihr wirklich seid, nicht zu akzeptieren bereit seid. Du nennst ein Leben der vollst?ndigen Freiheit spirituelle Anarchie! ich bezeichne es als Gottes gro?artiges Versprechen.<br>  Und nur in dessen Kontext kann Gottes gro?er Plan vollendet werden.<br>  ihr habt keine Verpflichtungen in einer Beziehung. Ihr habt nur Gelegenheiten.<br>  Die Gelegenheit, nicht die Verpflichtung, ist der Eckstein der Religion,<br>  die Grundlage aller Spiritualit?t. Solange ihr das umgekehrt seht, werdet ihr den Kern der Sache nicht begreifen.<br>  Tut, was immer ihr tut, aus einem Gefühl der wunderbaren Gelegenheit heraus, die euch eure Beziehung bietet – die Gelegenheit zu entscheiden und zu sein, wer – ihr – wirklich - seid.<br>  <br>  Du nimmst eine Menge Romantik weg, wenn ich dich zum Thema Beziehung befrage. Was ist denn falsch daran, wenn ich mich Hals über Kopf verliebe, ohne vorher darüber nachzudenken?<br>  <br>  Gott: Nichts, Verliebe Dich in dieser Weise in so viele Menschen, wie du m?chtest. Aber wenn du mit einer Person eine lebenslange Beziehung eingehen willst, dann m?chtest du dir vielleicht zus?tzlich auch ein paar Gedanken darüber machen.<br>  Wenn du es anderseits genie?t, Beziehungen wie einen Flu? zu durchqueren – oder noch schlimmer, in einer Beziehung bleibst, weil du glaubst, sie aufrechterhalten zu müssen, und dann ein Leben in  stiller Verzweiflung führst -, wenn du es genie?t, diese Muster der Vergangenheit zu wiederholen, dann mach weiter so.<br>  <br>  Okay. Ich will also die Instrumente für das Eingehen einer langfristigen Beziehung finden – und du sagst, eines davon ist, da? wir die Beziehung in bewu?ter Absicht eingehen.<br>  <br>  Gott: Ja, Vergewissert euch, du und deine Gef?hrtin, da? ihr euch in der Absicht einig seid.<br>  Wenn ihr auf bewu?ter Ebene beide darin einig seid, da? der Zweck eurer Beziehung darin besteht, da? ihr eine Gelegenheit, keine Verpflichtung,<br>  erschaffen wollt für Wachstum, für den vollen Ausdruck des Selbst, für ein Leben, das sich zu seinem h?chsten Potential aufschwingt, für die Heilung jedes falschen Gedankens oder jeder minderen Vorstellung, die ihr je von euch hattet, und für die letztliche Wiedervereinigung mit Gott durch die Kommunion eurer beiden Seelen – wenn ihr diesen Schwur leistet anstelle der Versprechen, die ihr euch bisher gegeben habt -, dann hat die Beziehung auf einer guten Grundlage begonnen. Dann ist sie richtig eingeleitet worden, hat sie einen guten Anfang gemacht.<br>  <br>  Aber das ist noch keine Garantie für den Erfolg?<br>  <br>  Gott: Wenn du Garantien im Leben haben willst, dann willst du das Leben nicht. Du willst das wiederholte Proben eines Drehbuchs, das bereits geschrieben wurde.<br>  Das Leben kann seiner Natur nach keine Garantien bieten, oder es würde in seinem ganzen Sinn und Zweck vereitelt werden.<br>  <br>  ich hab′s schon begriffen. Also, jetzt habe ich meiner Beziehung zu einem sehr guten Anfang verholfen. Wie erhalte ich diesen Zustand nun aufrecht?<br>  <br>  Gott: Du sollst wissen und verstehen, da? es Herausforderungen und schwierige Zeiten geben wird.<br>  Versuche nicht ihnen aus dem Weg zu gehen. Hei?e sie willkommen, dankbar. Nimm sie als gro?artige Geschenke von Gott, als herrliche Gelegenheit, um das zu tun, um dessentwillen du in die Beziehung eingetreten bist – und ins Leben.<br>  Bemühe dich wirklich darum, da? du in diesen Zeiten deine Partnerin nicht als Feindin oder Widersacherin betrachtest. Strebe danach, da? du in der Tat niemanden und nichts als den Feind ansiehst – oder auch nur als das Problem. Kultiviere die Technik alle Probleme als Gelegenheit zu begreifen.<br>  Gelegenheiten, um zu…. ich wei?, ich wei? – sein und zu entscheiden, wer du wirklich bist.<br>  <br>  Richtig!

bc8ce046604b18aabad6fc95e96b59ebaa	Do what comes naturally. But I think you should ask her if the relationship has a chance of ever going anywhere or if she wants to be platonic forever. If she doesn't answer within a reasonable time frame(one you decide) move on, because it would mean she really isn't that into you. She'd be forcing herself to feel things for you, pretending. It would backfire in the end.You deserve someone who is real with you.|`|AA10903221	no, dont do that, that would be one of the worst things to do, dont ignore her!  dont fully throw ur feelings out there just yet, i understand shes driving you insane but it happens.  continue on with the friendship && see how far it goes, treat her out you kno, continue the friendship but dont make it very obvious about treating her as if she were ur girlfriend.  shes probably been down this road before so shes probably afraid of commitment, maybe something happend in the past where she lost a boyfriend AND a friend.  give it time, dont rush into it. TRUST!|`|b1e2af293626ef080c0facf79e160d36aa	if your friend thinks you should just see what happens maybe she is a scared skeptic like me give her your attention but don't dog around if  you avoid her now it's gonna seem like you've given up without trying hard enough|`|dd3883ac5acb40428aca694fdbfca7c9aa	You Should tell her how you feel. Then if she doesn't talk to you ever again you know she isn't your friend or more than that. She isn't worth all that effort if she doesn't feel the same way with you. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|e22e9ee74eabc3c434716dc389e7b470aa	You should tell her!|`|AA11142532	Just tell her how you feel. If she stops talking to you, then go after her. Do whatever you can to make her understand. But don't stop talking to her, DON'T make her explain anything first.
683a6e1b11aafa819a47b0b1aada53cdaa	They say the key to a good relationship is communication, but most men lack communication skills. You can try to talk to him about how you feel, but if he dismisses the conversation, that's a bad sign. But if you truly don't feel he loves you, you should've called it quits before you posted this question. Why spend the energy trying to get back his love, when you can spend the same energy with someone who will truly love you? A love that tears you down, that causes doubts and insecurities, isn't really love.|`|5a061edb35de656e4cf7d90ebb066a8daa	just tell him you do feel the same way you did when you meet.....<br>  take a brake and see how things wok out in a week or so.<br>  dont talk to him try to avoid him the see how you feel in a week or two..........|`|cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	If you truely do not feel that your fella loves you, and if it has felt that way for quite awhile, then it is time to talk about it by telling him what you see and feel.  If he concurs that the same feeling is just not there the way it was, then it is time to shake hands and part company.  If he tells you he has heavy things on his mind that preoccupy or worry him and he is just down, ask him what you can do to help.  If there is no help in sight there is no reason to stay where you are not appreciated.  If that is the case, run do not walk out of that situation and find yourself someone who cares and shows it the way you deserve to be shown!|`|de54a3e03bbad67dcce72bab4fdf3be3aa	Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Take a long break and see what happens. Dont chase or beg, its very unladylike.|`|AA11452842	Let him go and move on.............|`|AA10682090	You should call it quits as soon as you're sure you're not in love any more.  Anything else is a disservice to both of you.

Especially if y'all become sexually active with him.|`|AA11310070	--I think you'd scare him--If I was eighteen, I wouldn't want a fifteen yearold likeing me...............--hey, what do I know though?<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I really don't like to lie.......|`|27249c0bd088451b3916f5ff949ec975aa	Its kinda weird. he'll be in college u in 10th grade.|`|878524ca5e9e0d81e45cdc714f998088aa	NO NO NO.

7d3d6055f9dc6ecc99ef3bac91624614aa	Ask how his day was. How are you? is a good conversation starter. Comment about the weather, a sport (the tigers making it to the world series for example!) or just make up something random! Find out what he likes (mutual friends are great for this, you can even find things out without asking direct questions about him! yay!) Once you find out, just talk. And try to make him talk a bit about himself too. Good Luck!|`|3d29b3c5add26506676d0872c7b6f4b3aa	Just say hi, what's your name, etc. Then flirt! Charm him to death lol.

When flirting don't let them know everything..kind of leave them hanging which makes them interested.

ae513c2ba48189a5c3aad604ca6d3250aa	Some guys aren't romantic in the ways girls want them to be. Look for other signs of his love, such as faithfulness, honesty, attention and loyalty.

I don't believe you can make a man be a romantic, it's just something that comes natural for them. You can put books, magazines and such in his path so that he can read them and maybe pick up some from that. But know just because he isn't a romantic like you, doesn't mean he doesn't love you..You can also be romantic with him and help him along, it doesn't always have to be the guy's place..Good Luck....|`|7830539d84f3e0d418024f11551f494eaa	you can't.

AA12275511	I only have five simple questions to guage whether i would want to go and be with this man from the next sixty minutes of dinner to cleaning his a** fifty years later when he's incontinent.<br>  <br>  1) What is your religion?<br>    I would prefer my partner to be at least a Christian.  No offense to the others, but it's just easier if you work within the same moral boundaries.  I mean with all the attitude, in-laws and egos, he last thing you would want to argue about is religion.<br>  <br>  2) What is your stance on monogamy?<br>    I think most people would agree with me on this.  I would demand monogamy from others because i demand it from myself.  It's hard enough to deal with a total stranger properly in a relationship, all the more difficult with more people in the mix.  If he says he doesn't believe in it, then at least it's clear from the get-go.<br>  <br>  3) What is your job?<br>    I must admit, I am drawn to people with money.  I am not ashamed of beng practical.  It's just more fun to shop with somebody who can blow as much money as you do.  If the guy has a dead-end job, or is rich but dependent on "daddy and mummy's" trust fund, then that's the end of the road for that date.  I want a man who is independent, driven and career oriented.<br>  <br>  4) Where did you go to school?<br>    Cliche and lame, i know.  But trust me, after the tumble in the hay, you would want somebody interesting to talk to.  Whatever school they attended would cover the books they read and the movies they like to watch.<br>  <br>  5) Do you have any pets?<br>    I always ask this one, shows they are caring and compassionate, not totally egotistical.  As to the type of pet, cats are ranked as best and little hamsters or birds rank the lowest.<br>  <br>  After all five questions are satisfied, then my favorite question is uttered...<br>  <br>  ...Your place or mine?|`|Mlwd5Bt3aa	I don't have a favorite, because I ask them everything I can think of.  Still do that with my boyfriend :D<br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I have one thing we choose not to talk about though and it's religion, we both know what we each believe and are good with it.

No relationship secrets. It would start at a completely random place, one no one would ever expect, like a long line at an awesome amusement part. Kinda like one of those situations when you're behind someone you think is really attractive but don't have the guts to strike up conversation. We'd end up riding the coaster together and exchange numbers afterwards and it'd go from there.|`|AA12210113	I  would probably meet my soulmate 'by accident', maybe in a church, or at someone's house, or perhaps even where I'm doing volunteer work.  We would date casually, hiking, going bicycling, maybe to a concert, doing simple fun things.  I would eventually introduce him to my family IF I felt he was someone I was pretty interested in.  The relationship would be pretty simple, fun, and HE would have to be someone who was definitely self-supporting and hopefully made more money than me, and had some common sense.  I'm married now, and have been, for nine years, to my best friend.  I love him but I am not IN LOVE with him.  If I had to do it over, we would not have gotten married (but that's another story).  We pretty much live more like roommates, each doing our own thing much of the time.  We get along, as best friends do, but he is not my soul mate.  We do not like the same kinds of music; we attend different churches; he prefers to do different 'stuff' than I do; we are both vegetarians (something we have in common), but I'm more 'at peace' than 'happy'.  Again, if I had to do it over I would be single still.  I might add that I have been married three times prior to this.  Then I was (happily) divorced for 18 years.  I've never had children so no one else was affected by my decisions.  I came from a wonderful (still happy married parents) family.  My younger sister married her childhood sweetheart (still married after 40+ years).  So - if you find someone who likes the music you like; who wants to do the same type of things you like to do; who wants to share most of your time, who has a religion similar to yours; is either a vegetarian or non-vegetarian like you; then consider he might be worth keeping.  Finally, take a look at his family.  (Our families are quite similar!).  I'm not truly happy, but I am basically content.  Maybe that's all I need right now.|`|hDbyMajYaa	saher|`|nWbBqpXdaa	Hmm.<br>  I'd have to say the beach. (:<br>  Or just a picnic .. with that person. =)<br>  Candlelight maybe?<br>  I'm not sure.

It all comes down to this if a guy really likes you let him ask you. And if he don't then he was not thinking about it. Sometimes guys just like to pick on girls becuse it gives them something to do.

If something were to happen then ok but dont look too much into it. Forget concentrating on if he likes you- think about if you like him and would you need to ask this question if you did. Personally I cant stand guys who I hardly know teasing me and I guess thats why your having these feelings. You should tease him back to see if he has any sense of humour. Are you at all attracted to him?

Maybe a very long time ago we did not have jobs, but you washed your laundry by hand, you started a fire to cook your food, you crushed grain to make your own flour and sewed your own clothes by hand. You may as well suck it up now and realize that we are "Wonder Women", we do go to work, do the laundry, raise the kids, clean the house, run the errands and pay bills and a hundred other things. Once we as women start raising our sons to contribute equally to all the tasks life brings, and teach them that men do do dishes, change diapers, plan a budget, go grocery shopping, and a hundred other things, maybe then women of the future will get a break.|`|AA11689259	Sounds like you are angry!

I told her some extra things to say so that he wouldn't think that I told her to tell him. Here is what happened:<br>  My friend: "Hey (name of my crush)! Did you say no to (my name)? Did you? Did you? Huh?" (I never asked him out though but I wanted her to say that as part of the plan. Then my crush gave my friend a confused look. I was laughing from my seat cause this was in my first period.)<br>  My Crush: "What are you talking about?"<br>  My Friend: "Did you know that (my name) likes you a lot?" <br>  (Then my crush turns to his friend with a shocked look and turns back to my friend with shock too. It was sooo great to watch. He didn't know that I was satching though.)<br>  <br>  That started things up. Then a few days later (after he had some other weird conversations with my friend which I planned) he asked me out.

Ahora deberás buscara otro para que lo haga y eso seguramente a tu marido lo pondrá celoso, al menos que no se entere, pero cuando vea tu hoyito agrandado nuevamente será inevitable... ojalá no te traiga complicaciones.<br>  PD: no hace falta anestesia, recuerdas la primera ves que te perforaron, acaso la usaron?. es cuestión de aguantar un dolorcito luego te sentirás muy bien con tu hoyito otra ves adornado.<br>  Saludos!!!!|`|2fd112d8e1176b1b53a146bf00d0c769aa	Jajajaja, que mal pensada soy... jaja y tu!!? porque haces esas preguntas maliciosas y luego sales con otra cosa he!?. jajajaja|`|30718d578c5a703d48643f89eb7e3778aa	Ajá.

En caliente ni se siente.|`|6417e2760ecbd14691f92d1cb77dfe2eaa	Si por mas que te lo empuja no entra, es que tienes el hoyo muy reducido.

51e9a4bb9069c49103c548191070a2a6aa	3 mos. is an alright amount of time to feel you know someone, even if it was online-chatting is chatting after all! Getting to know him on a more personal level is a good step as well! Glad to hear you're comfortable with him, as I have a feeling you have a terrific sense of people's character. sounds like a gentleman! I say go for it. See what happens! You ONLY live once-Magic just might happen-just don't listen to any Chante Moore!! :-)) Hell, I'll be there if he turns out to be an Azz!!|`|061e6c4595893b11f8669bff4bd96c31aa	Just go with it.<br>  if it feels right, what is the problem?<br>  Sounds like a great guy<br>  word of caution, do let someone know what you are up to with him.<br>  SInce you dont know anything about him other than what he told you, it would be nice to have a friend know where you are and who you are with just in case. <br>  Kudos for finding such a respectable guy<br>  THEY DO EXIST!|`|2523157d34ae9af4ecbfe8233717b9a7aa	sound like a good thing to me. keep it going.|`|4800cf32319bd37a2f66e983ce3cd041aa	i personally would go to his local police dept and have him checked out. i would also go to interview his friends, tell the police that you met him online and see what they say. i would also google him and go to that website where you can find stuff out on him... for a days pass it is like $7  or something, i will also be sending you an email on this. i don't want to scare you, but this is potentially unsafe... i think on some level you knew that, or you would not have asked the question.<br>  <br>  you are out of your "safe zone" of people that you know, which is cool and all, but be careful.. don' t let him pick you up from your house, always meet him at a public place... just play it overlay safe for now.|`|8de8a9f0755b4c629043fd53b3ce0f24aa	aka YOUR PERFECT GUY ...if you can feel that comfortable and have huge feelings for him on the FIRST date...i mean that is it right there...he is a gentlemen, polite, stays close you(basically holds you while you sit in the car) like you said..."He was very respectful the entire time, opened doors for me, basically the works! " right there you just answered you own questioned and just needed another person to elaborate...well that is all i have and i give you all the luck in the world and that everything continues to go great for you guys...if you want to talk to me more in depth go ahead and im me ok ...chinaman0389|`|a33d25db8cab57795952da38b2dd2415aa	Sounds to me like a true prince for you!  But watch out!!  Looks can be deceiving, sure he is Mr. Wonderful now, but what's to say in like a month or so he starts to show his true colors.  I mean at first everyone is kinda shy I think, but I would definitely get to know him a little better before you start thinking long term.  Just be careful and don't drop your guard until you are for sure he is not a pedophile!  Good luck!|`|d3bc679bbd4e93325aeee9a804ac7818aa	you need to see ho he feels,  no nothing is wrong,  but do be careful|`|d605d540360722a10b941fd3dab168a6aa	ask him if yall can keep going out ..never know he might be your one|`|029ca4debb0bca9ff23642342d1983e1aa	That is beautiful!! Of course it is safe to feel that way.   You've met someone you have true chemistry with.  That is bound to develop into LOVE if everything stays the same.  That is the kind of bond most people are missing out on these days.  Hang on to it.  You'll regret it if you don't.  That is, if he stays the same.  So long as that wasn't a front and that's who he is, then I would think it safe to say that you guys are meant to be.  Give it a little more time, you will know it if you feel it.  Follow your gut instincts and thank God for such a blessing!|`|24c36133fd1ef8f3fea1af4157f19086aa	becareful with him he could kill u or rape u|`|2a75dc3664fadbcc3e373c91e9887671aa	I think you would be better off getting a pet.

So I would say use caution and find out more about him.   On the gr one everyone meets once a month, knows each other by name online, have each others phone numbers etc.....they even had a party for me the first year I went there over 6 years ago....just got back from my 7th trip.  Anyway, in states its so different so please, stay in public places until you find out more about him...where he works, background, friends of his.....you did smart by driving your own car to meet him and not having him at your house the first time......do that until you know more also.....Good luck|`|92f1395ac162c7f39c8c0b5d4f04c596aa	yea. i think he is the one for you. just do not judge him first. its still your first night out. try going out with him several times. make him do things that can reveal his personality. as you know maybe that is not his true self. just try to hangout with the person and do not rush.<br>  <br>  maybe invite him to your house for the new years eve or something else.|`|c272f4aabc711204307353f53e0201fdaa	it is good to be cautious at first, make sure wat his intentions are etc. have u seen/talked to him since? you seem to get on really well, see how he feels about you. if hes that smooth he may be a bit of a player and already have a girlfriend. just try not to fall for him just yet...|`|ca802fbe4ff4da924dfc23da712c8b60aa	well it is really your choice for this guy but my advice so if you really want to be with this guy talk to him more and more your friendship well grow stronger and stronger every day i think it is a beautiful think but if you don't want to be with its guy then ask him just to be friends and who knows you might be really good friends wathcing each others back so i wish the good luck to you belive it!|`|519e9650ee9d42ee9f0a3132587b2291aa	Sounds like you had a good night, so take it slow. noone said you have to move at the speed of lightening and preferrably the slower the better.

b55876359d487d7a14c25a399fd4172faa	well maybe its the way that you ask them out.  If you do it all the time, maybe you've gotten to the point where its rehearsed and not sincere.  I know when I get hit on by a random guy, I like it when he is a bit out of the ordinary and when he starts up a conversation for a little bit then asks me for my number.  It sounds like you are confident in yourself which is good... just don't give the over-confident vibe that is a major turn off for girls.<br>  <br>  A way to really show that you are interested in a girl pick out something that attracted you to her (that is nice) like "You have gorgeous smile" something like that... it might sound corny but when a guy comes up to me and says something like that I'm beautiful it really does make me more interested/ attractive to him.|`|4wOOa0JNaa	Why would you rather go out with girls you don't know, than with girls you do know?<br>  <br>  I think you may have answered your own question: when you get to know a girl, she feels you're interested in more than meets the eye.|`|BTHUuOVraa	It's all about how you present yourself, girls dont know your personality etc from first sight so you should ease them into conversation and get it flowing. You might not be their type aswell? Also, personally i dont like it when a guy is too forward when he introduces himself. But i do enjoy casual conversation if he's got something that you can build conversation on. & then things go from there. :]|`|a6XaTJBsaa	You're probably hitting on the wrong girl...

TRvS8DcYaa	Mira creo que debes prestarle atencion pero tampoco es algo tan grave, son cosas de la edad todos los chicos lo hacen... los hace sentirse vivos ante los demas y supongo que un poco mas  varoniles tambien. Tene cuidado por ahi se esta revelando por tus cuidados excesivos! Dejalo un poco solo que aprenda a golpearse contra la pared, le va a venir bien, no te digo que lo dejes hacer lo que quiera por supuesto que no... pero a veces verse un poco solos les hace bien.

Ahora es un tatuaje... ma?ana embarazará a alguien o (toco madera) probará la droga... y si espera solo gritos tuyos, no dejará que le ayudes...

A mi parecer si se te fue la mano diciendole ese monton de cosas, sobre todo lo del siquiatra. Creo q te falta un poco mas de acompa?amiento en su desarrollo, porq de lo contrario te hubiera comentado sus deseos. Puede ser q también esté temeroso de contarte cosas q el se imagina y tu lo betas sin pensar q alguna vez tambien fuimos un poco locos. <br>  <br>  Por tanto, mi consejo es, decirle q si él quiere ganarse tu confianza, q lo minimo q esperas es q el te cuente todo, de lo contrario te seguirá ocultando cosas como la q descubriste. Ambos deben dar de su parte para q la relacion madre-hijo sea fructifera y no conflictiva.<br>  <br>  Y, por otro lado, tener un tatuaje no es gran cosa, eso si, depende del lugar q se haya tatuado y q haya sido hecho por un experto. Yo mismo como padre q soy, tengo muchos tatuajes, demasiados para contar, y actualmente son vistos como un arte y no relacionados con mafia o drogas.|`|d14cfdac7f0bc99884464570b066d753aa	yo hize lo mismo cuando tenia 16 pero lo mejor que puedes hacer es hablarle bien y darle consejos de manera que el comprenda que esta mal <br>  no le grites trata de comprenderlo<br>  suerte|`|f90c42504ce6a2a1985ffa8a827404f8aa	Hablo como papá. Creo que por más jodido que sea, no hay otra posibilidad que darle ciertas prerrogativas a nuestros hijos para que vivan su vida, tomen sus decisiones, se equivoquen, y aprendan de ello.

That's the only way to let you know "I REALLY like you and I want to call you so we can go out".<br>  The guy a doesn't have any respect to you telling you that he likes someone else more than you. <br>  Guy b is sweet and probably likes you more than guy a but he has a girlfriend! Not only it ain't cool to go for a guy with a gf, but if he does that to her, he WILL do that to you as well.<br>  <br>  Guy c doesn't have any class and is eighter unexperienced, or plain dumb. <br>  Who gives a girl his phone number?? The guy who will wait by the phone for a phonecall which you never gonna make.<br>  Loser. <br>  He wants YOU to call HIM now.<br>  Then he's gonna want you to open the door for him, pay for his dinner... and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  Guys remember. You MUST ask her  for HER home phone number. Don't give her yours. 19 out of 20 she will never call!!|`|0ec6592ca1f48301b9fa1dc011b9d614aa	i ansered your other question too. go aftr the guy b because he's is probebley really hot and a great person, and a little on the bad side!!|`|57x8PJFCaa	Guy c but girl get to meet him|`|V6gNkA02aa	go for the timid one one is the most ggenuine in his fellings towards you and wouldnt look twice at youre friend|`|15fd51a6d65879ce3e02a68cd3266382aa	Well we know guy ONE likes you already, so keep him in the mix. Guy THREE is kinda sketchy, it could be the act of someone in need of a friend or a friend with benefits. Guy TWO sounds perfect, but the thing with the girlfriend is interesting... I'd go for guy TWO or maybe the guy that you like! Dont just go for the guy who likes you...he may not be the best for you. Go for whoever you like!

Here's how I broke it down. Guy a can't make up his mind so he says he likes both and then goes on to compare them. But really he has no idea which one he likes more. Never go with a guy who compares, it always ends up bad. Guy b may be flirting with you, but from personal experience never get involved with somebody who already is attached to somebody else, you don't want to be that girl who caused their seperation. Guy c seems great! He's single, but most importantly he's subtle. These little signs that nobody else really sees are the most promising, he's not trying to make the whole world know that he's into you, which is adorable and sexy. Go fo guy c for sure!|`|gfi62dogaa	they all like u, DUH!go 4 guy c.he seems the nicest &most likely 2 stay frends aftr u brake up.(if u brake up)|`|i4qOrg14aa	don't go for any.<br>  it's not worth it.<br>  A likes you cuz your "hot", which leads to bad relationships<br>  B has a girl friend, not good,<br>  C, if anything, him|`|wSCtDmCWaa	guy c<br>  <br>  guy a- doesnt rly know what he wants?<br>  guy b- huh girl friend could be a problem<br>  guy c- sounds good. he likes you duhherr|`|r4nCI4IBaa	go for me...<br>  <br>  <br>  guy c would be best cos he likes you and not your friend or another girl.

It is up to the person doing the dating I would think.  By the way your English is terrible.  The word is back "ground"  and they "marry" them and it is "relationship" and "does".  Just to let you know.  Use the spell checker above.|`|d5ab567b899bd25e26c77d845b02b273aa	Who said it wasn't ok? I'm from a hispanic background and I never heard of that before. But I do think getting involved with a man who has kids makes it hard on you. I wouldnt want to deal with the ex and be compared to her. And the father really needs to give his attention to his kids while their young and need him most.

I like it when my guy tells me who he finds attractive.  It's just open honest communication and it doesn't have to be a big deal or lead to drama.  Of course, I'm assuming he doesn't do this all the time.  If he does, tell him 'yep, there's a lot of attractive women out there hun, and aren't you lucky you have one right here!!'

BOsDhWbJaa	I truly believe that adultery has been going on for a long time however, I believe that people our beginning to lose their moral values at a alarming rate due to upbringing, society, acceptability, music, television, and lack of role models.  The older generation of people like your grandparents were brought up on moral values.  Look at the times and what is acceptable on TV in Music or ever political figures it is Americana's who are keep the ratings high on these immoral programs.  I am terrified for what will be acceptable when I am long and gone.  I grew up on acceptable programming or better yet I spent most of my childhood outside and not on line, in front of TV, playing video games, and visiting friends rather than talking on the phone.  We lack social skills as a society which talking face to face with someone helped build you human morals.|`|984cf5d692e4026812bef64a847ff5b5aa	A moment is stronger than a person's self control. when they're caught in the moment, they don't think about what they're doing until it's too late. it's sad really. i've experienced it and i'm on the recieving end but i'm trying my darnest best to forgive and forget. it's never easy. and it still isn't but i still believe the possibilities that the best is yet to come.|`|grceAVOvaa	I have wondered the same thing. <br>  <br>  I think that our society has put such an emphasis on thinking about yourself first, and also about doing what makes you happy right now.<br>  <br>  I have been married fo ralmost 5 years. My husband and I have had our rough times and I have had people tell me that I should just leave him.  But I remind them that I made a promise! For better or worse.  If I was not willing to work through anything, I would have not made such a promise. <br>  <br>  Marriage is just not as sacred as it used to be. We have lost sight that marriage is ordained by God and can be blessed by Him. I know without my faith in God and the lessons He has taught my hubby and I, my marriage would have been over a long time ago. It is so easy to cheat, so easy to divorce. I don't know if you are married, but if you're not- be sure you can keep the commitment before you make it.

I love the way you use the rhyming and what you're writing about, you put a lot of emotion into it.  Maybe... not make it so... "corn-bally" you know what i mean?  Make it more... like WOW you know.  You don't always have to use the rhyme in the same pattern, you can just throw in random rhymes.  IT may help you write more, and free verse is always fun too.  Other than that, this is a great poem, keep writing!

a1ac8cf24b8a5f9e5136d5a9a63d5330aa	Oi Dalila!<br>  Existem várias situa??es que podem levar a um esfriamento do namoro.<br>  <br>  A principal talvez seja ausência de amor.<br>  <br>  Muitos namoros têm início em paix?es, atra??o física e também por ser ela (ou ele ou ambos) muito bonitos e gera um sentimento de desejo de possuí-la(lo) e exibi-la(lo) aos outros como troféu.<br>  <br>  E de repente a paix?o, atra??o ou sentimento de posse do belo perde a gra?a.    Aí o namoro esfria.   Porqu n?o foi construído tendo o amor como alicerce.<br>  <br>  E se n?o existe amor, mesmo que por apenas um, n?o vale a pena insistir.  Mas isto só vc pode decidir....<br>  <br>  Melhor que o esfriamento ocorra agora porque o inevitável sofrimento é mais fácil de curar, do que mais adiante, depois de casados, quando as feridas se tornam cr?nicas.<br>  <br>  Pense nisto !<br>  <br>  Gostaria muito que você consiga superar esse problema e seja muito feliz !<br>  <br>  Mas, caso n?o consiga, dê a volta por cima e siga sua vida.<br>   <br>  <br>  Se você conseguiu manter um relacionamento por mais de três anos é porque tem algo de muito especial e outros notar?o isto em você, e logo estará com alguém que, quem sabe, seja por toda a vida.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bjos e boa sorte !|`|RWww0hZjaa	Uma boa conversa e sair um pouco da rotina pode resolver o seu problema !!!<br>  Boa sorte !!!!!!!|`|d39a467d0730004da190a8fd810270ceaa	a rotina, n?o deixa isto acontecer na tua vida tem que estar sempre inovando principalmente no sexo|`|kwv0qDedaa	A verdade casca-grossa?  - Aguenta  aí, filha de Deus, dê um pé no trazeiro deste namorado, que ele quer você só para ¨cama¨ , depois do casamento(...) você vai lavar cueca e fazer o grude, enquanto o ¨tranqueira¨ vai deliciar-se com as cocotinhas,  agarre ao Espirito Santo de Deus, que possa trazer às suas m?os aquele que será seu eterno companheiro !!!

FFcH6XsZaa	Oi, Dalila !!<br>  <br>  Eu nao diria a vc que nao devemos sonhar, pois o sonho alimenta a nossa felicidade. Mas percebi que vc esta bastante inseguranca perante os seus sentimentos. Olha, amiga, pode ser que ele te mereca, mas so o seu coracao saber te tocar. Se ame, se auto-valorize e faca sozinha uma reavaliacao de sua vida, dos seus ideiais, dos seus propositos e felicidade. Depois parta para tomar uma decisao exclusivamente sua. <br>  <br>  Outra coisa a tv e o mundo virtual atrapalha muito os nossos conceitos de felicidade e muitas vezes nos leva ao abismo, pois ninguem vive de ilusao e sim de amor verdadeiro.<br>  <br>  Um gde abraco e torco para que vc consiga se encontrar e permitir que a felicidade e sonhos penetrem em seu coracao, Lu !|`|DE0jTxpYaa	Minha amiga, você esta disiludida com o amor, mas ele é muito maior dque tudo isso que vemos na internet e em outros meios de comunica??o.<br>  Amar é t?o bom, que quando estamos ao lado de quem escolhemos para a vida toda ou parte delá nos dá asas para que possamos pelo menos nesse período nos sentirmos vivos. <br>  Portanto, o amor é realmente tudo isso e mais um pouco de bom. Esque?a que est?o nos mostrando que podemos encontrar nossa cara metade na tv, no rádio, na internet e em outros bichos mais, quando ele bater a sua porta verás que ele é MUITO LEGAL!<br>  Um abra?o a vc e confie no amor ele é maravilhoso, ainda mais quando correspondido.

Quantas respostas! Acho que n?o sobrou muita coisa pra dizer, mas... <br>  <br>  As pessoas se tornam inesquecíveis pelas impress?es que deixam na gente. Explore cada um dos sentidos em várias ocasi?es. <br>  é importante que o tempo em que vcs estejam juntos tenha qualidade. N?o tenha medo de brigar por um motivo que vc considere justo. Personalidade é marcante. <br>  N?o tenha medo de parecer pegajosa. Se for expontanea será maravilhosa. E carinho é sempre bom. Deixa na pele uma memoria que ninguem supera. <br>  Saia com ele. Qualquer lugar serve. Se for chato, marca. Se for divertido, marca. Se for belo, marca. Se for perigoso, marca. O importante é que qlq outro lugar visitado ganha uma nuance diferente.<br>  Beije. Deixe o gosto do beijo como presente na despedida. Beije de leve, beijo com paix?o, com fúria, com lascivia, com pudor, ruidosamente. E aproveite para deixar a marca do hálito, o cheiro da pele, dos seus cabelos. Ele sempre que sentir um perfume, n?o importa qual, se lembrará de voce, do seu cheiro. O perfume de quem se ama é inconfudivel. S?o todos e n?o é nenhum.<br>  Dê presentes. Nada caro, mas significativo. E aceite também. é importante saber aceitar. Inclusive, saber aceitar quando ele resolver retribuir todo esse carinho e, também se ele n?o quiser retribuir. Voce tem que fazer isso porque vc quer fazer. N?o espere reconhecimento, mas se vier aceite-o.<br>  <br>  Acho que sobre sexo n?o posso dizer nada. Foi o quesito mais votado. Mas acho tambem que vc n?o deve fazer pra ser inesquecivel e porque ele vai viajar. é uma express?o de carinho t?o valida quanto qualquer outra. E deve ser explorada sempre.<br>  <br>  Beijos!|`|40390a3dfd727995726410e70fed1329aa	Olha garota n?o sei se vai resolver o seu problema ,mas leve o cara num bom motel e fa?a com ele o que vc n?o fez atá agora ................quem sabe se bem feito seja inesquecivel !|`|1FvSHdO1aa	uma noite de sexo ardente sem limites e pudores, fantasie-se, fa?a coisas na cama que nunca fez mas ele sempre pediu, use bebidas afrodisiacas, espalhe chantili ou doce de leite em seu corpo e mande ele tirar tudo. é isso que recomendo!! ele n?o vai querer nem mais ir|`|RHzcwPi8aa	sabe colega o amor é um sentimento tao profundo e intênso que fica até dificil responder está sua pergunta mais nada é melhor do que um te amo, do que um abra?o carinhoso, do que palavras sinceras procure sair em lugar á dois para que possam ficar á vontade o que prevalece é o teu sentimento.

En el marco de una relación de pareja, en peque?as dosis y como una reacción de alerta ante un bajón amoroso pueden resultar saludables, pero los celos excesivos se transforman en un arma muy afilada, que puede herir y causar mucho dolor.<br>      <br>  El problema no reside en el hecho de sentir celos, sino en la intensidad de los mismos, en su frecuencia, en si tienen una base justificada y en la manera en que éstos influyen en nuestra conducta. Los celos patológicos deben ser tratados con la ayuda de un profesional en una consulta psicológica, pero si la persona celosa no ha llegado a tal estado enfermizo, puede acudir a sencillas tácticas que le permitirán equilibrar su estado de ánimo y retomar la armonía en pareja que se basa en la ternura, la comprensión, la tolerancia y el respeto mutuo.<br>  <br>  ?Quieres aprender a controlar los celos? ?Toma buena nota de las tácticas que te proponemos a continuación!<br>  -Piensa que tu pareja te quiere tal y como eres. Para aceptar ese amor que te tiene debes amarte primero tú también, así la comparación con los demás disminuye y tendrás menos propensión a sentir celos. Acéptate más, trabaja la autoestima. Según los especialistas, el perfil psicológico de la persona que siente celos se relaciona muy frecuentemente con la baja autoestima y la inseguridad. <br>  -Es importante que fomentes tu propia vida personal, con tus aficiones y proyectos. Cuando una persona se vuelve más autónoma y creativa la probabilidad de que los celos se produzcan es menor. Y aumenta la comprensión hacia las actividades que realiza el otro. Tu pareja es una persona, no tu propiedad, y el excesivo control necesita dejar espacio a la mutua confianza. <br>  -Cuando te asalten dudas primero cálmate y luego habla sobre ellas. Identifica si existen razones justificadas para sentir celos, y si son ciertas comunícaselas a tu pareja con pruebas en un tono conciliador. Se trata de saber qué ocurre en realidad y de cotejarlo con tu percepción, que puede ser errónea. Comunica tus sentimientos especificándole claramente las conductas que te hacen sentir así. <br>  -Aprovechen para fortalecer el diálogo continuo, la confianza y el contacto amoroso: serán herramientas muy útiles para superar el desencuentro y los celos. <br>  -Acepta que estás sintiendo celos y recapacita sobre sus causas. ?Son celos por comparación y miedo a ser reemplazado? ármate de valor, confianza y comprensión para aceptar la realidad, pero haz un esfuerzo especial en ahuyentar los pensamientos irracionales. Instálate en el presente y si sufres un cuadro agudo de celos o te sientes incapaz de gestionarlo sin ayuda acude a la consulta psicológica. <br>  -Pon atención a la frecuencia con que aparecen problemas de celos en tu relación sentimental. Si en una pareja los celos son permanentes, éstos tienden a desgastar y perturbar la relación afectiva, porque surge el reproche, el reclamo, la exigencia y la presión continua hacia el ser querido. <br>  -Presta atención a las siguientes se?ales de alarma: <br>  <br>  ?Necesitas controlar todos los movimientos de tu pareja? <br>  ?Cada vez soportas peor a sus amistades? <br>  ?Le reprochas continuamente sobre su forma de vestir o comportarse? <br>  ?Crees saber más sobre las intenciones, pensamientos, etc… de tu pareja que ella misma? <br>  ?La necesidad de tenerle sólo para ti se ha acentuado en los últimos tiempos? <br>  -Si respondiste afirmativamente a la mayoría de las preguntas seguramente estás siendo víctima de un ataque de celos.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.consejosparamujeres.com.ar/sexo/pareja/celos/controlar_celos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.consejosparamujeres.com.ar/se...</a>|`|GMNVkIcDaa	Con una gran dosis de autoestima elevada.

I know a lot of people who can't.

Save dating for later.|`|AA11475541	I don't think you will have to worry about that to long, I'm sure you are a beautiful girl and guys will be lining up to take you on a date. Don't be so down on yourself, you will find your Prince Charming oneday. It will probably be sooner than you think.|`|UqQ8kD4oaa	i went on my first date at 12 when my parents didnt approve lol...change your hair or something?<br>  im shure there are guys that like you jus dont say nything|`|aEe6RxJqaa	Listen, I'm 13 too. Okay? Comprende? I've never had a boyfriend. However, my friend has, and he broke her heart TWICE and she's still with him. Having a bf isn't all that great. Wait. Plus, there isn't any point in going out now, it's no fun. No drivers license, no car. And most of the people I know are too shy to even kiss. All they do is give each other presents every month.|`|72Svt7BBaa	You're only thirteen. You're not even in high school yet. Don't worry & don't try and make you're self hot.

Do Not Worry About It! You've got plently of time to find someone. Don't worry about dating until high school, that's when things usually start happening for us gals, anyway. Just be yourself.|`|AA10813228	Don't feel bad!! All I have to say is that it really just takes time (and u will get a boyfriend at some point in your life). I'm only 15 (going to the 11th grade) and I've never been on a date really either. I could have gone on plenty, but I never like the boys that ask. Sometimes boys are really shy being so young and immature. Not having someone is sometimes better than having too many boys asking you out and having them try too hard (trying to kiss you and touch you).

But if he still buggin' ya that means that he's hasn't gone through puberty yet..hee hee..kiddin' k?|`|b334e21468b3e7b490b6d769a92bf8d0aa	I would feel flattered. When he starts telling you all this, just let it go in one ear and out the other. If you don't give him any response about it, or any comment, he'll look for something else to talk about. Or you can change the subject, then when he mentions it, just start talking about something else. He'll soon thing its not anything in common with you...........ps, have you talked to his wife about this, and told her it bothers you a little bit?|`|297b0bd03cdfa70df5e356ec2be28c72aa	What happens in the bedroom should stay in the bedroom.

I once had a friend that kept asking me to go to a topless bar. After so many times i ran out of excuses and went. The first girl out was his wife! I turned around and left. He came after me and said don't you like the way my wife looks? I said she is your wife, why would u want me to look at her? He said he was proud of the way she looked. I told him it made me very uncomfortable, and to never again  put me in that type of embarrassing situation again. I found out later that his wife was also surprised to see me there, and she was equally embarrassed. I guess that the moral of this story is Your friend needs to be put in his place, and let him know that u will not again be the subject of his sickness. If u don't stand for something then maybe u will fall for anything.
AA12296157	My gawd, girl.  You're really obsessing over nothing.  Guys are so not as critical as to the actual inseam measurement of a woman.

HObPuBhaaa	I've already told you this, but I think you need to talk to her and tell her exactly what you told me you wanted to tell her. I know its hard for you to tell people the truth, especially if you think they will be mad at you or you will hurt them, but I think if she figured out you were thinking of her well being in your intentions, she may take it like an adult. You should tell her that what she's doing to him is the same thing you-know-who did to her and its probably hurting him in the same way. Tell her you're worried about her health and that you don't want her to get hurt by drinking and smoking. I don't know how well she'll listen, but if she listens to the stuff you don't tell her, she may turn around. Hope all goes well.|`|28khMyaOaa	you tell her that if she doesnt slow down what shes doing by about 10 notches shes gonna end up digging herself   her own grave if she dont slow down shes gonna end up killing herslef by drinking smoking drugs if she does it and sleeping with people.. she should slow down a bit. and u should be there for her and tell her that ur concerned for her health and safety

The entire package that makes you so special!

Honesty is a must and caring I also like confidence and flirting not conceited. And one more thing even though its pretty stupid i like when they play hard to get but still show that they are in to you. I like when they aren't afraid to do things in public like put their hands on my waist or kiss me on my cheek or neck things like that. That's what I think is hooooooooootttttttttt in a guy.

If you don't feel comfortable with talking to him, just let it go.|`|M2u9jAqBaa	dont let it bug u...!!!! just keep being friends with him and he will see what he is missing out on make him feel jealous..!|`|VoghCDLIaa	Nip it in the bud.  Pull him aside or email him and say "Look, I want to apologize for my behavior the other night.  I had too much too drink and I crossed the line.  Let's just forget about what happened and move on.  Deal?"  The sooner you do damage control, the better.  Good Luck!|`|nFwthsbXaa	Lol no. You were under the influence. Trust me i have done many things that were embarrassing we i was tipsy/drunk.

mHdXF0E0aa	I can't determine whether he likes you or dislikes you.<br>  <br>  The straightforward approach would be : <br>  sugar coating it.  Bring him a cookie, doughnut, or something... Tell him you'd like to talk if you could, then - when you are in private, ask him if there is something in your behaviour at work that bothers him or if you are doing something to annoy him.  <br>  <br>  The sweet is there to kind of sugar coat the talk.  He'll feel flattered that you took the time to get him something, especially if you've paid attention to what he likes.  <br>  <br>  It'll also make having the conversation easier.  He'll feel a bit more comfortable answering your question.<br>  <br>  If he answers and basically says "well, I don't think you act appropriately around the men in the factory" or whatever.. You can then decide to either change your behaviour or not.  <br>  <br>  If he answers, that no you really aren't dong anything wrong... Then, it's probably that he kind of likes you but doesn't know how to show it.<br>  <br>  If this last one were true... You'd see other signs.  He'd make a point of talking to you when he doesn't have to, things like that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck-<br>  I hope it's that he likes you and not that he doesn't.<br>  Livia-|`|949553b31d242afc8ea164e0cd7cb288aa	sounds like he likes you|`|dsvYl3j3aa	I think the answer is quite obvious isn't it? But he just has a really immature way of dealing with it. Sucks to be you, an immature boss can be hell, maybe you could ask around more and brainstorm for more ideas. Try this, be really nice to him and see what happens, like flirt with him a little, you may not want to do this because its against your principles|`|vnJ4kkVVaa	ye i think he likes u...<br>  dats probably y hes keepin u away from da other guys|`|1d0506f135929cc8816ac80d0ea1b762aa	sounds like he likes u|`|1b6f49ed4ecd0530123d255289923697aa	if he only does it when you talk to men then it seems as if he likes you

KxgZJek1aa	well if u seem nice or flirty to the "less pretty" girls they may think they have a chance with you. While the "more pretty" girls think ur less hot urself and think of you as just another guy. it depends how u come across to the girls and how shy or outgoing they are. don't judge a girl by her looks tho all girls are beautiful in some way and deserve to be treated well.|`|VcKciqNmaa	maybe cause your SHALLOW! considering girls pretty or less attractive or just judging by the way they look is sad.|`|et3ktoAiaa	you sound like you act different to girls that u are attracted to and girls u are not. try switching these attitudes,,u will see the results..|`|GPpGCzQcaa	the less attractive are more desperate.|`|wPQSUHGJaa	Find the girl that you like.

jTgZTlWDaa	dunno|`|3901dc31abdb6e0e635f6417b85d3235aa	Simply by have a face.
GY3C2MIeaa	its something i call "the look". its a look that says "heeeey" and can say ALOT more without ever saying anyting at all. If he responds, then you have something for sure. If not, its prolly cuz he thinks you have glycoma or something. lol jp. It's prolly cuz he needs more hints if he doesnt respond. Try a little flirting, flirting that is playfully serious, so its all in good fun, but at the same time a reason behind it. be yourself and be confident, he should be able to see that. hope it works out. good luck ^_^|`|09a90b84646c940d5b99c6b13f905379aa	Let him catch you checking him out and if he is interested he will bite. As for being interesting person, you are and don't doubt yourself. Good luck.|`|cefc76d6840768c09f717ef610859fe7aa	This is a tough one, I would say dress a little more scantly but if he is already around that, then it would do you no good.  You're going to have to go with the personality route, it's tough to pull off but I have confidence that you can do it.  If you're just thick and not fat you could show a bit off, it can't hurt.

etLbHWKAaa	It depends in the state that you live and the amount of money she or he makes..... Alimony is designed for the other party to make that finacial change that comes with a divorce.  It should be a short term idea, but some people take advantage of the other party....  If you know that you are getting a divorce, staying home and not getting ready is the worse part.... not only for the person but for the children and the finacial future of those kids..<br>  Alimony comes with many factors to answer- What are the monthly expenses, how long have you been married, what is the cause of your divorce and most importantly how good is your lawyer?  Good Luck and all you can do is the next right thing for your kids and you exsignificate other- Remember at one point, he or she was the best thing in your life!!!!!|`|AA11388175	it goes by Your income and Hers... just like child support|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	In most states alimony is no longer awarded.  When it is it is usually only long enough for the other spouse to "get on their feet", if the "displaced spouse" stayed home during the marriage it lasts long enough for her/him to get training to work outside the home and to find a job.  The only time alimony is for "life" is when the "discplaced" spouse is disabled and can not work.  How much YOU pay depends on your financial situation as well as the cost of living in the area your spouse lives in.  There is no set amount as every divorce is different as well as every state has it's own rules governing such matters.|`|21b936193daa66f804ce8e7d0be950dfaa	It is hard to say but I would say that if you cheated on your spouse in the marriage you pay more than if you didn't cheat.|`|AA10274492	It depends on income doesn't it?|`|BwzcEQcRaa	It all depends on your income.|`|vx4bz5rfaa	A heck of a lot more than staying married.

yBgO0AJ0aa	yes girls get more emotionally attached unless they sleep around sex is something two people supposed to do when they love each other every movement put into it is more attaching! some people have sex but if your making love sweaty, heart racing, kissing, love then yes. It will change the relationship it can become a make up thing it can become an everyday thing hopefully not a girl gets tired lol, but sex changes it all!|`|W97kGLZ6aa	NO bad idea.|`|mQD35Z4xaa	Girls are attracted to those who can use grammar correctly as well (sorry for being a grammar-nazi).  (You mean DOES a girl!)<br>  <br>  Hey, it all depends on the girl.  Read your signals from her and make your own conclusions - but typically, I've found they become more attached after 'relations.'|`|yVgMPVzsaa	Well, for me it makes your relationship more stronger if you have sex, esp. if both of you are comfortable on doing it.<br>  just take care of yourself not to be pregnant its your choice.<br>  Actually that feeling of being scared to be pregnant is natural<br>  we dont want that to happen to us. its never easy to be pregy<br>  esp. if your not sure with the guy.
AA10069753	Definitely smile. You can't hide your teeth forever. Sooner or later, people will see them. Is it likely that you'll be able to hide your teeth long enough to impress someone (who would be turned off by them if they saw them right away) and make them change their mind about you? No. This isn't a deep, dark secret that you can hide until they love you and will overlook it, like the huge collection of Archie comics you keep in your closet. Be up front about it, and whomever does find you interesting and attractive will be an up-front person.<br>  <br>  Smile.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Get some dental work, it will be worth it for your self esteem. And people should not be so mean, you may have bad teeth, the female that said this has a very bad attitude. A tremendous character flaw, personally, I would rather have bad teeth. She has a ugly bad personality. You can go to a dentist and have a consultation and make monthly payments and get the work started when you have paid into the account. Do the work, it will change your life, aren't you worth the extra money? Good luck and God bless****|`|87015fd279387c02edeab649d5b4851eaa	hell naw don't smile.  get some dental work.

It's good to know that one day you'll go to the dentist, but for this time being, don't bother too much bout what other people thinks. As long as you keep your teeth clean, it's way better to have  ugly teeth rather than have nice teeth, and a bad breath!|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	smile without showin your teeth is all i can think of untill your able to get work done|`|c9cc8b2a57096c5bcd84e21040942293aa	Calling a chick a chick will "put offf" a chick!|`|88b39426ad33389c27e1fa32fc17b366aa	i think you should keep smiling... dont worry what other people say... :) keep your chin up ok?<br>  Danielle<br>  xx|`|989052c69fcd685c2101c2308927a085aa	Personally, I like teeth with character. "Perfect" teeth are so boring. As long as your teeth are clean and healthy looking, let 'em shine. You will be far more memorable than Mr. Flashy Smile.<br>  <br>  And besides, who would want someone who would avoid another for something as trivial as crooked teeth anyway?
VEEgoDkFaa	Unless she puts her hands on you or throws an object at you that hits you, I think that the best thing that you can do is act as if she dropped off your radar and simply ceased to exist. When she yells whore or anything your way, don't even look at her. After awhile she'll begin to look really stupid. She's only doing it to upset you or get a reaction from you in the first place. After all, she's the unpopular one that others are moving away from as well, it's not just you who doesn't want to be bothered by her anymore. Completely ignore her.

No sé a qué edad empezaron uds a salir, pero si tenían entre 15-18, lo más probable era que él no fuera virgen!!! Además el sexo está muy sobrevalorado. Lo importante es lo que vas a sentir por estar enamorada de él, no por lo que haga o deje de hacer en la cama. Lo mismo él, si nunca tuvo sexo con alguien amado, va a sentir cosas completamente distintas al estar con vos que las que pudo haber sentido con otras mujeres. Tendrás que trabajar, eso si, tu tema de los celos. No importa si él estuvo con alguien antes que vos, lo importante es que te ama y quiere pasar junto a vos el resto de su vida. No podes dejar que actitudes de su vida pasada, antes de conocerte, te limiten un proyecto con alguien a quien amás (con lo que cuesta conseguir hombres que se quieran comprometer, y vos lo vas a dejar pasar!!! jaja) Espero que te sirva de algo mi consejo, saludos y suerte!|`|xtbx6Gncaa	A la persona que tenes al lado la tenes que aceptar como es, con lo bueno, con lo malo, con su presente y pasado.<br>  Si, estuvo con otras, pero se quiere casar con vos, es mas fuerte que uno que se casa porque la quiere poner.<br>  Acordate una cosa que te voy a decir, a mi me fue muy útil:<br>  -lo que no hicieron de jovenes lo van a querer hacer de viejos, es preferible que de chico haya probado y no que le entre la curiosidad de grande.<br>  Si lo amas no veo el motivo por el cual no estés con el.<br>  Besos y suerte|`|OYvQgRWraa	mira no necesito leer todo tu comentario si no estas segura entonces no lo hagas.|`|zUGkJn5zaa	estuvo con otra y no es virgen por q  no te conociio antes... tu crees q se aguantaria? ........ sin haaberte conocido antes...? hay egente q comete errores y no s e pueden echar para atras... pero piensa q tu vas a ser la primera en casarse y la unica en su vida y creo q eso es lo q vale no vivas del pasado por q serias un museo con patas.. pero deverdad no habria razon alguna de tratarlomal por lo q hizo... por q todo fue antes de concerte... y me imagino q sera muy especial contigo aun mas por q vas a ser su esposa y en un futuro la futura mama de sus hijos y creo q el pasado lo dejaras atras y  dejarte llevar por lo q siente por q el estando parado ahi al frente tuyo cuando diga "acepto" de verdad es un paso muy grande y te esta demostrando q tu vas a ser y eres la unica <br>  <br>  cuidate <br>  chau!|`|VSt65vflaa	mmm todavia ni empiezas....mejor primero decidete a cambiar, sino sufriras mmuuuucchhhoooo|`|a2f61364089b1ab68ba647dea98d48c6aa	Mira yo creo q el tema de la virginidad es un tema mental y no fisico ...si paso cuando no estaba contigo entonces xq incomodarte y de q religion eres q piensas asi ..q edad tienes ??? q edad tiene el ??? por favqor si tienes la duda de casarte o no no creo q vaya por el tema de q ya no es virgen ..analizate bien interiormente q solo tu tienes la respuesta ...un beso|`|a327071376188681e8f096e741eb85e9aa	Pues si realmente lo amas, no debería importarte eso, ya que si te lo confio es precisamente porque él confía en ti y no quiere que más adelante tengan problemas por eso, no crees?<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, si te incomoda mucho eso, dejalo y espero que no te arrepientas después de haber abandandonado al amor de tu vida...<br>  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|dDqRU4nzaa	me parece que estas cometiendo un grave error porque si tu te pensabas casar con es porque sabias que ivas ba aceptar su pasado y errore, sus defectos porque cuando se quiere de verdad esas cosas se olvidan y lo que estas pensando es algo erroneo he inmaduro de tu parte porque casarse no es solo sexo o si los dos son virgenes o no lo son|`|ea713aa711757937e9111bd58605d916aa	Pues deves hablarlo con el varias veces no importa que ya lo hayan hecho antes, solo hablalo mucho para que asimiles su pasado, (que ya paso), creeme que te va a ser muy dificil encontrar a otro chavo virgen. y todo lo que va atener que pasar antes de que encuentres otro... tendrias que volver a empesar...  <br>   <br>   <br>  yo asi estuve un tiempo, igualito que tu, pero resulta que mi esposo ya vivia con ella y ademas ella era Belly Dancer, imaginate mis pensamientos de cuantas veces no le habria bailado ella a el... y ahora duermo con mi esposo el la cama en la que el durmio con ella en el pasado...<br>  hace poco todavia me dio un poco de colera porque encontre unas fotos en el garage, de ella bailando casi encuerada y el me confeso que fue el mismo el que le tomo las fotos, pero que ya no se acordava que las tenia en el garage...<br>  pero cada vez que me pongo tan celosa lo hablo con el, y  el me calma y me hace sentir segura de su amor!, no te preocupes y trata de superarlo, si tu no sueltas su pasado haras que el recuerde otras cosas que no te convendrian a ti!|`|gHmSnCPGaa	No te cases simplemente por que lo dudas y por que si te importa tanto el que el no sea virgen entonces no lo amas por que lo que no es de tu a?o no es de tu da?o  pienso que con dudas no va a funcionar tu matrimonio ahunque el fuera virgen.

Get a divorce. Free legal help is always available if you look for it. Don't be a victim. Have sense, because if he's hit you once, he'll keep doing it, and it'll only get worse and more intense.

gR5Jf8tOaa	Should you suck up what? LoL, not laughing at you but the question your asking is what I have continued to ask myself. I feel you and what I can say is that you should never settle. Cause I know I am not going to. I don't know if I believe there is someone for everyone either cause I haven't found anyone yet either. Im 28, when I 22, I wanted that life you read about. Now all I want is a companion. Preferably a life one. But with lifes trails and tribulations, we as people are becoming more and more unsympathectic to others. Like you wrote either he lives with his momma. Honestly there aint nothing wrong with that unless yoru taking advantage of her. I would give anything to live with my mom again, I miss her more than anyone could imagine. R. I . P  DRW.. But we are all picky and you should be, I can't even say to an exstent cause if you feel its someone you gone spend your life with then why not know everything there is to knwo about that perons. Cause your going to take the good with the bad anyway..  <br>  <br>  Well I'll say this, 1 is the loneliest number even if your rich! So good luck and know that there is a man waiting for you or better yet looking for you! So I guess time is either on our side or not!|`|pcllamFUaa	It will happen when you are not expecting it but dont wait around just live your life the best you can for you.

If you tell her that you want to do this right and that's why you havn't been "making moves" she'll know she's special to you and she'll probobaly give you all the time you need.

YAlJgLpKaa	People will lie and say anything to get close to you. Did you have sex with him for him to say that if you did he was lieing in the first place. dont worry about it just move on it will get better. He might want you back then you can make him feel salty.
kpDCCTU2aa	Hey, ur so sweet. I understand ur problem cuz I'm having exactly the same problem as u right now. Write a letter to him, tell him what ur thinkin' cuz writing is much much easier to do than talkin' to him face to face ( u probably will feel bad again and not be able to say what u think). Try not to meet him in 'bout 1 or 2 months. If u let him meet u daily and show him that u care 'bout him, he'll never be able to forget u & he' ll misunderstandin' even more. Good luck!|`|08fd3cc702b135582f4a24282a74c634aa	you seem really worried about hurting him and his feelings.  getting your heart broken is a part of life - you just learn and move on.  However you definately don't throw it in the other person's face though.  It seems like he's trying to make you feel guilty about the fact that he likes you however telling you that he wasted 2 years of his life liking you is awful.  If he really liked you he wouldn't tell you that.  I don't think he's a very nice guy.  You should really think about if you want to be with a guy that trys to make you feel guilty about your own feelings.  good luck hun.|`|3BvUOsk1aa	Best way is to hook him up with a friend of yours, they might hit it off, and you get to keep him as a great friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4kdLtO9Yaa	I used to be just like the guy your describing. Tell him straight up how you feel, dont beat around the bush and make up excuses, itll make him feel worse when he finds out. The truth hurts sometimes but hell recover|`|AA11267886	The guy will  get over it if you reject him. If you dont like him like that then whats the point|`|bXT6BpbKaa	find someone else|`|wSCtDmCWaa	you ethier like him or you dont.<br>  <br>  you can date him and see if feelings change or just tell him how you feel. that you think you'd be better as close friends.<br>  <br>  sometimes it's easier to face it now before he grows even more attached to you.<br>  <br>  and it is going to hurt him. you cant fix that. it's his feelings;; his emotions you really just need to be a closer friend<br>  <br>  tell him how you feel then talk to him more. so he at least thinks you care.|`|2T7crrVnaa	although you don't want to...maybe you should just go out with him. If he has liked you for that long he at least deserves a chance. Then when you tell him you don't think it would work out you can say it with confidence because you have tried and it didn't work. If you dont he will always wonder what it would have been like and will think it was not fair that you never even gave him a shot and he might end up resenting you for that reason. Beside a date might be the final deciding factor and will help you to know how you really feel.|`|B0w3ffvmaa	FYI - It's really not "sexy" to spell the word 'me' as meh. Stop spending so much time chasing boys and learn to spell.|`|Evwy1uU6aa	Okay well 1st of all he isnt heart broken because he never had a chance to get heartbroken.@ndly Dating someone younger than you especially if you're young is a bad idea because everybody knows that girls are faster,smarter, and better than boys.So do whats best for you because he'll get over you when some else walks past him, they always do|`|cIXlhgtnaa	tell him ur REAALLLLY sry, but u don't like him like that...or give urself time 2 think.|`|f2df5845eac7cb4fcab2064aa6fd061daa	Go with your heart. No one knows you better than you.|`|wo51awNHaa	Be honest with your self and him. If your not into someone in the same way as they are into you then things can get relly complicated. One of you or both of you will end up really hurt and pissed off in the end trust me I have been there and done that. Just let him know that you like to hang out with him and stuff but that you dont think the relationship would do well past that degree. Or tell him that you like girls like that if you have to but I think your best bet is going to be honesty. It really is the best policey. Good luck.|`|xtyAzHKjaa	i don't get it. first you said that now you're getting to know him, you're starting to like him a lot, but you kinda don't like him? i think you need to make up your mind about whether or not you REALLY do or don't like him before you mess with this kid's head.  Once you do figure that out, you need to realize that either decision could crush him cuz if you do end up goin out with him but only half-heartedly, he'll end up getting even more hurt than if you woulda just rejected him. why did you wait 2 YEARS to make up your mind? sounds like you're just leading him on cuz you like the attention and now you're stuck cuz he's fallen for you. if you don't like him, there's no avoiding it. you're gonna have to sit down and tell him face to face that he's not what you're lookin for in a bf, but he's an amazing friend that you'd LOVE to have, but you understand if he doesn't wanna, and then there ya go.
9antNZRuaa	First off I would like to say taht you sound like a very nice guy, and if you have nothing else going for you, that is a big thing within itself. Being a teenage girl I would say tell her in a private situation, and when you tell her you should say something along the lines of you think she is special, and then give a reason why. If you guys are good friends as it is then you could explain the things you like about her, but if not going into to too much detail might scare her. Overall I would say go with your gut, when the time seems right do it, and if certain words sound right say them. Anyways, good luck!|`|62e3be16d49d1b324769516e8f280f15aa	i think that you should find out if she likes anyone else. if she dosent go tell her. and if she does go talk to her until she likes you. thats all i can tell you i hope that it helps. good luck. youll find the right girl even if its not her.|`|m6AbneEAaa	my best advice is! how does she manage to make you feel the way you do, do exactly what she does and be nice, some girls like that, but don't be too nice, cos she'll think your a needy person. just be a man, most teenage boys your age don't know a thing about girls, so just be smart, when she does something you like, tell her and compliment and reward.<br>  <br>  like for instance! if she helps you with your homework or an assignments, say thanks to her and would you like me to help you in any way, show her you appreciate her. let her have some of your lunch, do things for her.|`|uPIAoe7waa	girls looooove compliments, telling her that she looks good today and stuff is a good place to begin, even though she might not react to your compliment you can be sure that on the inside shes tottaly flattered and....happy lol.|`|53T5OGraaa	when you chat to her ask her if you can take her out on a date...this way you arent telling her how you feel so you wont give too much away as if you tell her how you feel straight away this may make her back off and you dont want this.<br>  <br>  get some time alone with her and then see how it goes.  if she says no then you wont feel like a prat for telling her your feelings only to get knocked back and it wont get uncomfortable for both of you as you can then carry on as friends.<br>  <br>  you seem confident with this so put yourself out there hunny and good luck...im sure you wont need it.|`|9de455d9e040a8762d7f367a6ef1d3a9aa	Act more interested in her. Let her know that you care. Tell her that her hair looks good, but in a funny kind of way. Make sure to let her know that you are there. If none of this works, invite her to go somewhere with you, but make it like a movie and take a bunch of other friends with you and their dates. Make it a sort of party so she isnt uncomfortable.|`|E9aSIrmIaa	be honest... how long you have liked her does not denote the fact she may not return the feelings.... just realize now, if she says no... its not the end. there are alot of things tou may see as her liking you, but may not be there... think with your brain, not penis|`|Fz0DGRhRaa	first of all, it is not going to happen over night so if you are going to start something you need to give it time <br>  just be yourself <br>  if you are wanting to drop some hints ask her things like who do you like or top 5's something like that or get one of ur friends to do it for you but make sure you regually have conversations, also flirt a little and make it obvious you are flirting but not something too much, if she flirts back you can take things a step further <br>  good luck x|`|KB7frzyPaa	Does she feel the same?  Get to know her first as friends and if she feels the same way that's good news for you, and if she doesn't I guess you are out of luck.  Start off slowly with her and see how things go.|`|mQRcvM1Oaa	pay loads of compliments  and drop hints about you 2 being together e.g : your beautiful u r our children gnna be pretty

He will sit by you whenever he can <br>  <br>  2. He always takes things from you and hides them <br>  <br>  3. He makes eye contact as much as possible <br>  <br>  4. He messes with your hair <br>  <br>  5. He laughs at you just to see you smile and tell him to shut up! <br>  <br>  6. He asks about your day <br>  <br>  7.

He hits you alot. (just play hitting ) <br>  3. He uses the first thing that pops into his head to start a converstaion with you <br>  4. He yelled, "Hi!", to your mom that day she picked you up from school. <br>  5. He blew off his buds to go see "Brown Sugar" with you cuz you couldn't get another pal to go and didn't want to go alone. <br>  6. He tries to make you laugh anyway even if he gets hurt in the process <br>  7. His voice gets softer ("Hey, you") when ever you two talk. <br>  8. You hung up on him. He called you back. <br>  9. You where invited by him to a group outing. <br>  10. He called you to talk about nothing at all. <br>  11. He imitates your laugh. OK, you do snort sometimes. Which makes you laugh even harder... <br>  12. He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation <br>  13. He sometimes stares straight into your eyes. <br>  14. He uses every possible way to touch you (your hair, face, thighs, ect.)|`|425b39e740d89af3613295362da900baaa	R U CRAZY???|`|8b5b03e45df9e56d2ad7a431288471a2aa	if you look at him and orgasm|`|AA11736908	I agree with asking him.  If you like him maybe you could tell him.  Then you can find out for sure.|`|bf36f1f23433d26f85446d6e08998af1aa	He will make just the right movement to be sure you are looking at him, and then he will not take his eyes off your eyes so just keep looking at him for an hour. If he is still looking..OH you will get married!!|`|OlOjdl7Laa	if he stares at you a lot maybe, jokes with you, maybe does anything just to start a conversation

6b37126c4f3eb7f5fd695fe30c781375aa	Never - friends first.  Always.
AA12289231	Depends on the guy.  My girlfriend is a talker, but it's all good because I'm a listener and don't say much.  This is one area where opposites seem to attract; if you're both talkers, then neither of you is listening to the other, but if you're both listeners, then you just sit and stare at each other all night.|`|EhGHbHbxaa	i like girls who talk. I enjoy listening and it breaks the silence.|`|GY3C2MIeaa	i love quiet ladies. they bring a sense of mystery to themselves and that stands out to me. it all depends on the guy, but a quiet lady is usually the better listener which is important to anyone. but ladies should always be themselves if you're looking for something real. nothing is more appealing to me than a lady who is true to themselves. plus acting wont get anyone anywhere too far. good luck. hope this helps a bit ^_^|`|ca30de5fb81d979a9a944fa08a4a60aeaa	For me the issue isn't so much about talking or not talking but about what is being said. Not many guys like the constant nagging and many are not that big on long or constant conversation. We don't even talk that much to our friends in comparison to the amount women do.|`|oM9JaK3Haa	They lke girls that talk and be quit.|`|QykwPawQaa	I personally think it's either way.  If a girl doesn't shut up she can get annoying but she can provide a spark.  If a girl is quiet the guy doesn't get annoyed but it puts so much more stress on making the relationship work.|`|S1xRTvVQaa	i dont like it when a girl doesnt say a word but ya i think its chill when they know when there turn to talk is and its clearly not always and they know that<br>  <br>  <br>  lol im not a guy though :p|`|y74keASYaa	i love a girl who talks, so no most guys don't like the "quiet ones"  as long as it's not over kill. but i believe that conversation is key in any relationship!|`|4f55d2ff9515ab32bf18556229a3228eaa	I like the talkitive type. Dunno why... but I do.
AA11375286	ask her<br>  is she a virgin?<br>  if not has she ever been tested?<br>  has she ever been in love?<br>  whats something she`s always dreamed of doing?<br>  what makes her smile?<br>  what kind of music she likes?<br>  her favortie artist?<br>  does she want kids?<br>  does she want to get married?<br>  things like that.allow her to dig deeper and you to get to know her, things that would be too personal are:<br>  what size bra do you wear?<br>  what size or kind of bras?<br>  do you give oral sex?<br>  have you ever given oral sex?<br>  would you give oral sex?<br>  whats the freakies thing you`ve ever done?<br>  you know rude things like that|`|sZjHX2kYaa	Ask her about her hobbys. What things she enjoy doing? What's something she always wanted to do? Ask her to describ the perfect date. If she had 3 wishes what would she wish for? What kind of movies do she like. Favorite food, color, etc. What makes her sad/happy. What turns her on/off. Has she ever been in love? questions like such not only will spark good conversation but will give you ideas for future dates, gifts, etc. Don't ask too many questions about sex. Depending on the type of female your taking out that will turn her off.  Good luck.
AA11749118	You don't need to decide what to discuss with this girl further in advance before going out with her. Do you prepare your speech in advance when you talk to your brother or mother? No. Even if you want to know a girl better, there are no such specific things which you should talk to her to know her better. It is quite obvious that conversation doesn't always go as you thought of. So what I feel is that even with the normal conversation (which is not prepared before), you can know a girl better. Just don't try to think of good things to talk and go normally. Things will automatically comes out and best wishes from my side.

I think one of the best things that you could do is make a monetary donation to a cancer society (like the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation or The American Cancer Society) in her name.  When there is a cancer walk in your area, you could form a "team" with your friends, and walk in her honor as well.  I know that when my aunt almost died from cancer when she was well enough we started doing cancer walks and people wore signs around their necks saying "I'm walking in honor of (blank)" and it was really touching.  That is awesome that you want to honor your friend like that.  I know she'd be happy.|`|AA10353121	My condolences to you.  What ever gives you a good feeling.It is not easy losing someone you care about.|`|AA11741676	I'm really sorry to hear your Best Friend passed away of cancer. I know its really hard to deal with, not even two years ago my mom died of cancer, and if u were around that can be really hard to watch. Maybe u should go to some kind of counseling to help u deal with her death. But i think your idea is great then u could all get together with snacks and talk about all the good times yaw had together. And I was thinking maybe plant a tree or flower garden in her honor that way yaw will always have something to remember her by. Bye Hun, good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5jWNxcLHaa	first bring her flowers and may be a pics of you two having fun together. and tell her ( in her grave) about what a great friend she is and how much you miss her.|`|Htjq2Xiaaa	Something small... umm... give her a rose, if she is a girl. Hang out if he is a guy... like maybe go to a restaurant or something, and make jokes...|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	do something fun, so she will be happy, like|`|UhIMPadDaa	In feb 2006 i lost my husband of 30 years to a heart attack unexpectedly and every year we do something special for him last year on fathers day we got lunch and went up to his grave and ate lunch with him this year we are going to get ballons and go up and release them to him in heaven, because we all know that is where he is. He was the best man that we could have ever found as a husband,father and grandfather. We love him and miss him and its our way of sending our LOVE TO HEAVEN. Some dont believe in heaven but to us he is in that special place and we will never  forget him. This is our way of honoring him. Hope it helps. Good luck.|`|tvisJFu2aa	I think that is a great idea if it's a girl than maybe lay some flowers on the grave, if it's a boy then hang out. or you could just do things that he/ she likes to do.

I believe it would be so much better if it was created by you. Read a few Graduation cards/some friendship card. There might also be some friendship/graduation cards. Since you write well and already have a topic and a feeling for the person, I feel just seeing some ideas Will remove your writers block .<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Congratulation on Graduation

What I did was I started making friends with people I had classes with and if I saw them during lunch I'd ask if I could join them. But there are other ways to go about it.

As a freshman you should be ideally situated to start conversations with other classmates about your subjects.<br>  1st off you should come up with a plan of action.<br>  1 - Identify who it is you think it would be easiest/desireable to make contact with.<br>  2 - try sitting closer to them and then maybe during the class ask them about something your lecturer is saying. There you go, the all important ice is broken.<br>  3 - follow this up as you are leaving the lesson, here's a couple of good questions -<br>  "did you get what he was saying about x?"<br>  "how are you finding this course?"<br>  "what else are you studying?"<br>  "where are you from?"<br>  <br>  Dependant on their answers you should hopefully have stuck up a conversation, I'm sure your conversation skills are great, if not just believe that they are and you will do fine, but remember - <br>  <br>  4 - You're are looking to make friends, so, try to listen really hard for any personal info they may give you, and ask them about it. f they like music ask what bands (that's usually a good one) films, theatre, videogames, you are trying to show that you maybe interested in what interests them (as any good friend should be)<br>  at some stage during the convo you will want to suggest doing something to get to know the person better.  It all sounds a bit cloak and dagger but believe me this is what everyone does conciously or subconciously to fit in.<br>  I don't know how old a freshman is (writing from the uk) but a good way would be to suggest going to a bar for a drink after class. or if that is not possible suggest doing something with one of the personal facts that you have just found out about them. (videogames, concert, happy-slapping, videos, jackass style craziness) you get the picture.<br>  <br>  "Fitting in" Is all about confidence and confidence only comes from practice. You may not make a friend at your first attempt but the next time you try you will be more experienced and confident than the 1st time.<br>  <br>  Then once you have a large social network and people calling on you at all hours of the day for advice fun etc etc you'll wonder just what it is you have to do to get some peace and quiet!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope everything works out<br>  <br>  JP|`|96b0535a973ef2cd6bc62a68e686d37aaa	Your routine really is tiresome and to think you have no one to talk to..<br>  I started out as a loner too, but now that I'm a senior student and yesterday was already gone. First, during lunch, I sit with pepole whom I can relate with. Of course it's hard 'coz many people are in the cafeteria and you can't easily pick out which is which. Why don't you try to target someone during your classes? For example, you saw a group of students discussing about thier favorite books and you might have the same interests. Have the initiative. Think positive. Try to fit with people who can accept you for who you really are. <br>  And be patient. Time will know when to find the perfect timing. Keep me posted if you like.. Ok? ;)|`|d2d5156bb25a8c223ed999c5aa9dddc7aa	I AGREE with the comments before me.

Being happy is all that we have these days and if we can't be happy what do we have....

OK, so you have very little in common with guy B.  That's good; you both are Young and can find things you both like to do and find common grounds.. Communication is the biggest thing to overcome, if you have that, you will be able to verbalize your feelings for different things and agreement on things to try.  As for the butterflies;  with like comes love, and with love comes happiness.  A good, honest, caring, god fearing man is hard to come by.  Look inside of him and you will find what you want, just don't be to hard on what you want out of your man because some expectations are set much to high..  Think about it..

Try doing it in a place you've never tried. Light candles, or do it in broad day light. Definately try: The Wow Him Pow wow.<br>  * "Sit your man down with his legs crossed. Facing him, straddle his legs and lower yourself into his lap--without him penetrating you. Wrap your legs around either side of his torso, so they're hugging his buttocks. Then, as you hold each other's arms increasing your speed as you come closer to climaxing. <br>  <br>  This takes eye contact and body to body closeness to the max but adds passion perk. The comfy upright pose encourages equal control over the speed and timing of his thrusting, allowing for a gradual buildup of pleasure for both partners. Plus, your clitoris is at an easy to reach angle, allowing him to stroke your love button without interrupting the hot and heavy action.<br>  <br>  Vary your rocking to prolonge the pleasure. You can grind into eachother slowly then suddenly speed up or get deep then tease each other with shallow penetrations. Get creative-- you never know what combo will wow you both to bliss"-- <br>  <br>  Just a peek of what the cosmo version of the kama sutra is like|`|7e10190af6d1e736eed6f450d70205d4aa	My dad's friend told me some tips too.<br>  1. lick his nipples<br>  2. do seX in a hot tub of water. <br>  3.Let him masage your breats<br>  4.

I got those ideas from someone, not myself!|`|AA11933459	ok..make sure he's comfortable. Ensure he had a warm bath. Cuddle up and slowly carasses him. Move from neck to chest to the 'Mother-of-all' pleasure spot, the groin. Slowly rub it. Do it real slow. Pull down his shorts. Make sure his hands arn't touching you. You SHOLD BE IN CONTROL. Blow softly onto his penis. Best if you just a sip of cold water. Carry on stroking it to rigidity. By now he should in '7th heaven'. Well, the rest is up to your imagination and mouth work.

Even if you answeryes to these questions --- Girl the answer is YES you will find that special someone!!! One thing that I've experenced is that people with low or no self estem/confidence often belive they are not worthy of love and seek out those people that will only take advatage of you and/or use you!!! another thing I've seen over and over is if a person feels unworthy to be loved and have a good healthy relationship ---- that person often sabatoshes any relationship they enter!!! At any rate you have got to unerstand that you like everyone desirve a life of REAL love and understanding!!! You might concider going to some kind of group that is for those with self-estem issues!!!! Girl you desirve the love and happiness that you are asking about!! es I know this really sounds strange coming from someone like me that is a swinger and is also a qualified member of the indiviuals with SMI (serious mental illness) and PTSD (post tramatic stress syndrom and major grief issues) but GIRL YOU ARE A WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL PERSON AND DESIRVE THE BEST LIFE HAS TO OFFER --- SO DAMN IT F*CK ALL THOSE IDIOTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU AND GO FIND YOURSELF A PEARSON THAT LOVES, CARES, AND WANTS T BE WITH YOU!!!

You need to help yourself before you even think about getting involved with anyone. As far as your self esteem goes....I would tell you to look in the mirror and find one good thing about yourself and from there work on the other things you do not like. Such as if you do not like your hair color change it, if you do not like how you do your makeup go and get our makeup done for FREE at a department store, if you do not like you weight start working out, or if you do not like your smile get it fixed. This many not be things that bother you but find what does and always remember things can always get better. Once you are totally OK with yourself than I would say go OUT meet, greet and live life.....God has plans that we all know nothing about so just go with the flow. Getting married is not for everyone but love is so just take it step by step and you will find what you are looking for. Enjoy life!!|`|42c1e5484a4084b4999958d36dd79361aa	you will find the right guy someday, you just are attracted to the wrong types of guys. hang in there and life will get better|`|45993dea2637b72ff6928be882b8e0dbaa	The best way to find a good man is to act extremely confident.  Your low self esteem may come across to the men you meet.  Only losers want women with low self esteem because they think they can manipulate them.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't feel like it, act like it.  If you meet a guy you like, make sure you act like HE needs you.  Which, by the way, he does!!  <br>  <br>  Have an excessive amount of confidence and you'll find that good type of man.  No man will show off their girl to their friends if you have a low self worth.  Live it up!  You only live once, make them beg for it.  I bet they will.|`|568c8fefc9b572cf5b933c7c676dcd1faa	Marriage should not be a goal that you base success or failure in life around.|`|AA10453315	you will when you stop worrying about it so much, just don't look for and it will find you.

Usually when you least expect it, or at the worst possible time.  But things always work out like they are supposed to, so never fear.<br>  <br>  Working on your low self esteem will help you though, as confidence is healthy, and attractive to others too.  iVillage has great message boards, and the one on Self Esteem is pretty good.
6534ffaaac69462c040c94caf0d77fc4aa	First off it would do NOTHING to change the way I felt about the child.....after all ANY man can make a child.....but it takes a special man to be a father. Having said that I would let the Ex know....as long as there was proof that the child was indeed not mine, that I did know of her betrayal......but again NOTHING would change between the child and myself and I would hope that he never found out.|`|61ac7b738ce0c77ea7900875057a3759aa	The son is 13 and you've loved him as your own all this time. Forget the wife, you need to keep loving this boy and provide for him. He's already had enough sorrow over your divorce.|`|0434e1d9107cf4f82f7329c8fbea91beaa	I think you'll find that most men would continue in the role of "father" even though not biologically akin to the child. It's similar to the love fathers have for adopted children but under somewhat different circumstances (being first led to believe this was his bio-child then learning it isn't).<br>  It is sad that as one poster mentioned, up to 1/3 of all children born in a marriage (or marriage-type situation) are not related to the father but without his knowledge. It is sadder yet that it is certain that the mother knew the father might not be the father but was allowed to perpetuate the fraud without fear of being penalized. This is doubly true when divorce occurs before discovery of the fact.<br>  Many men have found themselves, many years after divorce, to have been paying child support for another man's child. When taken to court, the most often ocurring thing is that he is forced to continue to finance her fraud, sometimes with her even bringing the biological father into the household while maintaining a legal 'right' to her ex's finances.<br>  In most states, it is still legally considered to be his child unless contested within a very narrow window of time after birth.<br>  <br>  Some states have begun looking at this problem because it is so vast and affects so many and have begun to create or alter laws to prevent rewarding devious women but more needs to be done. I feel that any woman who proports a child to be the child of a man, knowing that the possibility exists that he is not the father, failing to make the possibility known, should face severe financial penalties, possible loss of custody and jail time. The cuckolded one should also have the ability to recoup costs that were spent toward the child against the bio father AND the mother, with interest and given the choice of at least completely equal custody without being forced to pay child support. That means he would be allowed to choose what is best for the child and himself without rewarding the cheating mother.<br>  It should also be considered whether to grant him a right to persue sole custody, depending on the needs and best interests of the child.<br>  <br>  Having said all that, I have wondered what I would do if after 20 years divorced, I found that any of my sons were not my biological children. I firmly believe I would inform my ex that I was aware of her fraud and then just probably drop it because laws do not favor a father in any area of "family law"; little could actually be done. <br>  I would prefer never to let my children know about it except I think it is of major importance to know their actual heritige for health and marriage reasons. Otherwise, I'd just drop it and continue my relations with my children as always.|`|5cb97200a0da0a5fd733e64501af556faa	If you love the kid just leave  it alone I know I have at least 2 kids that are not mine but I love the kids who care ant way|`|79d1e539728561272751a53d8398a465aa	Well, biology only goes so far. If I raised the boy as my son, nothing would really change. I would let her live with the fact that she lied to not only me, but the boy as well. I would ensure that the boy understands that I am still Dad, no matter what the DNA says.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the bio-dad still has rights to the child. That is the way the law works. But, the child being 13 would have a lot of say as to who he wanted to spend time with.<br>  <br>  I have experience in this.My mom and dad got married when I was very young. I grew up knowing him as Dad. He decided he wanted to adopt me, but told my Mom he would only do it as long as I knew about it. They told me when I was 11. He is my Dad, the other guy was just a sperm donor who put my Mom in the ER 7 months pregnant. To this day, I know who my bio-dad is, but have never contacted him. No reason to, I have a Dad.<br>  <br>  Now, if the little boy wants to make an attempt to contact the bio-dad, he should be supported. Most likely though, it will not really change anything. I would also continue to pay the child support, this will show that you don't care about biology, you are going to take care of your "child". Let Mom deal with the guilt of lying to those closest to her, her children.|`|c049edfa5536b651a0107995bcbc3a08aa	say nothing...simply go to court and demand a paternity test and remove your legal obligations|`|yPgu7hDfaa	I would continue to take care of the child.

So I wouldnt say anything to her.|`|33bfcd90b8c8bd688850310d6834e999aa	You know its been documented that approximately 1/3 of those that get paternity tests, the child and father don't match. I'd like to just take the child away from the mother. Maybe I would just move away and stay away from women period(kinda what I'm doing now).|`|5472912519051908ed850d6ecdf22934aa	well if she's the ex then she's not in my life much. So to HELL with her. <br>  <br>  i would still love the child as if he were my own - I mean I am his dad for all intents and purposes - where has biological dad been lo these 13 years? Zero contact? Then f*ck him too and the horse he rode in on. <br>  <br>  It would just be more proof to me i was right to leave that daffy lying hurtful b*tch, but it sure would make it hard not to spit on her the next 200 times i saw her lying b*tch face. the one thing i'd really have to put to rest is - who else knows? i would never want my son to know unless *I* wanted to tell him and would tell her if she ever tells him then she's going to disappear in the middle of the night some evening and never be found again. but if she knew that she'd tell him just to be spiteful, one gets the feeling. <br>  <br>  i just feel like the number of women lying about who the dad is is going way up. and it's g*ddamned depressing.|`|AA11245961	At this point in time, about the only thing I would be concerned about would be getting in touch with a lawyer and finding out if there was any chance of recovering the $ from the one child that was not mine.

It is okay to ask him if he is busy...Does he initiate your outings or is it always your idea. In my opinion, if he is interested in you, he will ask you out. Let him call you...if he doesnt within the next few days I would move on.

If you believe in no sex before marriage, then tell him that.  If you believe in sex before marriage, then go for it, but tell him you practice safe sex, and make him a wear condom.  I my tought my kids if they want to have sex, to make sure their partner wears a condom, but it's better to wait until marriage. You never know if he has VD, or  if you get pregnant, then it's going to be your problem, not his.  Unless of course he's rich, and has alot of money that isn't asset protected, then you could have the baby, and sue him for child support.  Never, never ever be tempted to have sex without your partner wearing a condom, or you'll be sorry.  The only time for unprotected sex is when you get married, your partner is tested clean, and plan on having kids.

My hair was a little shorter than yours when I got married, so down wasn't really an option.  I got some clip in extentions, put my hair in a low ponytail, and then put the extensions in.  Then I wrapped it up in a bun-ish type deal....It was low, at the base of my neck and I still wore my veil up high kinda...it looked great and was sooo easy.  It took 10 minutes to do....  I got the extensions at one of those booths at the mall for about $80.

If it was only to spare her feelings, or was it b/c you had done something you were trying hide, if so, why would you need to hide it from such a close friend.??? Once you figure out the "reasons" you can have that open conversation with her. Tell her the absolute truth about why you lied, and the feelings behind it. (Don't justify the lie, only explain), don't make excuses. Then tell her, that the friendship is very important to you, and you understand that it will take time to reestablish trust, but you hope that she feels the friendship is important enuff & worth it.

fF5eEYAvaa	I'm sure you are the envy of many on here...having two lovers.  You should sit down and choose one before you are emotionally drained from trying to please both at the same time.  Also too, that 'newness' may be what is happening to your main squeeze.  It just that you have a new found playmate and it is taking you away from your main girl and you feel she is toobusy for you because are having too much fun with your new girl.  You really need to follow your heart and choose one before both finds out and it all hits the fan and then you end up losing both of them!  Place yourself in their shoes....how would you feel if you found out your gf has been cheating on you all this time?  Follow your heart and do the right thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck  =)|`|VVHkaW2haa	wow this is a really tough situation. Sex is really important in a relationship though.

If you'll do anything your in trouble. But your kids are in worse trouble living with you some one needs to come in and take them babies to a safe place, away from someone who puts them in danger. Get a job and stop having kids. People kill me that have all these kids and can't support them self much less a child but they keep having children and the children suffer from not having a decent upbringing.  Grow up and get responsible and sale your car instead of yourself.  Then go get help

Arguing allows her to be the center of the conversation.  You are focusing on her and most likely- you stop what you are currenty doing because of the argument.  Subconciously (or not), she knows that she can get all of your attention by "acting up".|`|jYLg3W0Daa	It's true because i feel the same way, If you don't argue then it means that you don't really care for the relationship. You and youe GF are two different people with different views and bad qualities(it's just human nature)and there are many things that yoy should disagree about and arguing shows that you careenough to see another's reason will keeping your own.I would argue with her until she nolonger has the will to argue, that would put an end to it.

32cgr5Vraa	Hey Sam!<br>  <br>  Gimme a chance to answer your damn questions before resolving them by choosing a best answer, will you?!?<br>  <br>  Anyways, I would say to your crush:<br>  <br>  1) Hey what's up buddy? Did you try to call me because I didn't hear my phone ring all weekend and probably missed your call?<br>  <br>  2) Hey man, I mistakenly turned my phone off because I wanted to take an afternoon catnap, therefore turned it off so I wouldn't get disturbed while asleep and forgot to turn it back on when I woke up so did you try to call me buddy?<br>  <br>  3) Hey I went to the movie theater with my friend(s) this weekend and I had to turn my cell phone off during the movie. Unfortunately, I completely forgot to turn it back on when I got out and then we all went out to a diner to eat and I had so much fun that my phone was the last thing on my mind! So did you try to call me or what?<br>  <br>  4) Hey buddy, you're never gonna believe this but I left my phone at home (or in my parent's car) when I went out and totally forgot to put it back in my bag so did I miss you call or not?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This whole scenario is part of what I would call "playing games" or "mind games", if you prefer, which I am not a fan of, far from it, but when you're trying not to appear too desperate in front of a boy, even when we all know that you are, you don't have much of a choice, do you my girl?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, you would have a record of him calling you in your "Missed Calls" log, wouldn't you? Even if your phone is turned off? Did you give this guy your home phone number or your cell phone number only? Does anyone else have (un)authorized access to your cell phone, like a younger & interfering sibling for example, that they could erase an incoming and/or missed call by mistake or on purpose? Let me know!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your crush Samantha & let me know how it all unravels in class tomorrow!!!
Qv9vdvORaa	I think he means that you should not feel "uncomfortable" asking him for his number yourself.  He probably thinks you're a cool girl and he would not have any problems with you approaching him.  So next time you want a guy's number, forget the shyness and the fear of rejection and just go up to him yourself and ask for it.  Find your FABULOSITY and own it!|`|32cgr5Vraa	Hey Sam, this is my last answer to you so make the most of it girl lol!!!<br>  <br>  What your potential boyfriend is trying to convey is that you mustn't feel either scared, shy, intimidated, uncomfortable or embarrassed to approach him directly and ask for his personal phone number yourself instead of getting your girlfriend to do it for you like a scared little deer in the road blinded by floodlights, know what I mean girl?<br>  <br>  I need to ask you something though: are you 100% sure that this guy knows for sure who actually likes him (i.e. YOU!) and that your girlfriend doesn't want this guy all to herself, maybe only for the mere fact that you liked him first and that she doesn't want you to have a boyfriend before she does because she doesn't want to see you happy perhaps?<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is...<br>  <br>  Is she a good & true friend you can trust 100%?<br>  <br>  How well do you know her?<br>  <br>  Can you believe that what she told you about this guy's words   is the God honest truth?<br>  <br>  That's what I meant earlier when I suggested you should maybe do a little "investigating" of your own before offering your heart to this boy, you get me?<br>  <br>  It's all up to you though, of course!<br>  <br>  Do what you want & what you think is right!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck in all your romantic endeavors Samantha!|`|9214ed6304221412cb2fc12e3be20c5aaa	That he likes you too. <br>  So what are you waiting for???|`|RETMVti0aa	probably that you shouldn't feel too embarrassed about asking for his number yourself

If she's mean to you after hanging with another mean girl, then I'd say she has a serious character flaw and you should thank God that she's not your friend anymore!

I know you want to be friends but do you want to be friends with someone that is mean to you?  Friendships grow and change over time.  Things happen in our lives and friendships break up as new ones are formed.  I would have to say that there is nothing that I would do.  You cant apologize because you didn't do anything.  You can tell your friend how you feel and that you want her to be your friend again but if she fails to respond to this or is mean than I would just end the friendship there. Personally I would wait for her to come back to you.  I wouldnt go out of my way to talk to her.  If she misses you she will come back.|`|6bc75d0327b2fc0ffae822a57604ce60aa	thats ezacly what happened to me well i had this friend who me and her were bestfriends and i think she was the bestfriend i ever had and well we started to be friends in the 3 grade and then in the middle of 43 grade a new girl came to my class and me and her became friends with the new girl and then before when we were talking she stared making me be mean to my best friend because the newgirl told lies and now we arent friends but now you should do what i want to do go up to her and say " Look I know were not friends anymore but i really miss you and I want to be friends with you so can we be friends?" and if she really liked you as a friend she will say YES! do it tomorrow no matter what your other friends say just do it the next time you see her|`|AA11619892	the same thing is happing 2 me right  now  so just be nice and act like u dont care. it worked 4 me so it might work 4 you|`|k6IM8xSfaa	First of all, you need to think about what kind of friend she was to begin with.  Seems to me that a true friend wouldn't turn on you.  So, I question whether she was a "true" friend of yours from the start.  If she was what happened to make her turn on you?  <br>  <br>  I know that friendship is really important and the most important aspect of friendship is trust.  You could try to get together, just the two of you, and talk about what happened and how it's making you feel.  If she still cares about you, forgiveness can take place, and together you can move on in your friendship.  It sounds like you are the one who will have to start this conversation.  If she chooses to reject you, she was never truly your friend anyway.  Good Luck!!

TTkELAf1aa	What you must do to take your mind off the guy is be with your loved ones like your family and friends. Just spend some quality time with them, reminiscing about anything. Hangout with your friends, go to club or anything to occupy your time and I will guarantee you will forget about that guy. Whatever big event that's about to happen, go with your friends and have a good time by mingling with some other guys. Whenever you're ready to step into a relationship, it will be the right time, right moment and the right place. You will be happy after all of this happens, and before you know, you have another guy that will meet your needs.|`|539741686ef63de8f4d8380010c3cdf4aa	Its all in your mind...You gotta be tough & except reality..Pick up your courage....No one can give you the cure to just forget him...Hang out with new people....Find another interest...Don't worry everthing will be alright...If he dumped you, he's clearly moved on...:)|`|s82FvB2eaa	THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ARE YOU GONNA LET HIM WIN BY SITTNG AND THINKING ABOUT HIM ALL DAY LONG I WOULD ASSUME YOUR STLIN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE TO SEEHIM EVERYDAY  SMILE LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	distract yourself....go out with your friends....make sure they do not talk about him.....or bf's .... or get a hobby|`|RrhEzwfAaa	Keep in mind that life goes on regardless of the one you're with. remember that it's not who you're with but who you are.
JDFEhZoeaa	People act differently around different people due to clicks in personality.  Both persona's could be true to the person speaking of you.|`|lGm3g5F0aa	I tend to look at rumors based on where they are coming from. Example, workplaces are often very clique-y and rumors abound. If everyone spreads the same rumor/says the same thing about someone, like let's say, "He's the meanest person," but nobody who knows the person outside of work says the same thing .. Either there are issues in the workplace, maybe he is only mean at work, or maybe he isn't mean at all and it is an unfair statement. However, if everyone who knows the person in every aspect of their life -- work, home, family, friends, acquaintances-- says the same thing, I might keep that thought in my back pocket.. I'm not saying I wouldn't approach the person with an open mind, but I would probably approach with caution.|`|GxvINAtSaa	RUMOR= <br>  -A piece of unverified information of uncertain origin usually spread by word of mouth.<br>   -Unverified information received from another; hearsay. <br>  -a story or statement in general circulation without confirmation or certainty as to facts.<br>  -gossip<br>  RUMORS ARE LIES!!!!|`|316ee24160431dbaceb23df61e47274daa	I would still keep that original info tucked away in my mind and if I caught even the tiniest glimmer or the rumor in what you present yourself to be then I would feel it to be true.

593bc8e36772e5a244b246be50fe7567aa	In my opinion,and you are asking for it,casual sex does nothing to make anyone feel good about themselves.Sex wasn't intended to be a recreational sport.Feelings,love and committment are the only things that separate us from animals. Women feel like giving in to a man's sexual urges is the only way they will call them again. However,sometimes the sexual urge is mutual. I willl never get comfortable with casual sex and neither will our Father in heaven. Re-think your values and see what you come up with. Good luck.|`|8f4gRDMdaa	That's why you take your time to get to know somebody first. You don't even know if you hate this person in the end.

Everyone have that guy that makes them feel like they are special. Listen if your woman instance didn't tell you that you did something wrong than why are you worrying about it but i never felt bad about anything like that. As long as you know you don't have a guy who runs they mouth like water and you know he likes you for you and not what you can satfiy him with than i say go for it but kind of make him wait for what he wants. You got to be in control of a relationship cause if you make this guy feel like the ball is in his court one time than you never know what may come next. Take things slow but you be in control in what happens. If anything else happens just remember you may or may not feel bad about what happen afterwards but it always takes two to TANGO.|`|ptV51EhTaa	no not really i mean you are never going to see them again probably, unless you made out with him or something then that is a little different..but im only a freshman and at homecoming i grinded with a college guy and i dont even know who it was...and i dont feel guilty at all! lol i hope that i helped! =]

My first date was with my first boyfriend, but he never asked me to be his girlfriend.  After a few dates is was just common knowledge.  We dated for 2 years and I still consider him to be my first date and boyfriend.  My next 2 boyfriends never asked me to be thier girlfriend, and the first question I got from my 4th boyfriend was "will you marry me."  I did and we have been happily married for almost 5 years now!  In most cases that just isn't done anymore.|`|irlaKjViaa	jason and I got him 2 month ago

So its hard when your a teenager to say you really love someone, then cheat.  No that isn't love.  No real love...Not in my book|`|ZVE5y7FAaa	im 16 and yea i have cheated on my boyfriend and he has cheated on me by telln telln some chicken head about his and mine sexualy life and some other stuff....<br>  <br>  i do love him and i cheated on him bec i was drunk..i went to a party and got drunk and had sex with one of my guy friends....it was a mistake and im lucky that my boyfriend forgave me...i do really love him and it was a 1 time thing cheatin on him and  it hasnt happened again...|`|BCYp6WNAaa	I'm 17 yrs old and my bf is 20. we've been together for 3 years and i've never cheated on him. idk about him...i believe him when he says he would never. there have been guys that like me but oh well i'm taken. same with him.<br>  i guess people that cheat dont actually love their bf/gf.|`|zTdp9hMFaa	People can have excuses but its obviously because theres no love there. If you feel the need to cheat then you obviously dont have the love in the relationship you need and no trust either
wSCtDmCWaa	aol? talk to him there?|`|svoDn3mCaa	odds r u'll bump in to him without his posse.  if u see him in n e of ur classes, in the halls, at his locker...just say hi and that you've been meaning to introduce urself.  maybe mention something u've noticed about him (other than the fact that u think he's gorgeous...although that might spark his interest...) u like his clothes or ur glad that he's making friends.  wut ever.  the best of wishes!|`|kNLng64iaa	Just be yourselves. To start a conversation you can introduce yourself and ask "How do you like our school so far?" or something like that. Questions are great for starting conversations. If your friend doesn't want to make a big deal out of it, then she should talk to this new guy by herself or with just you, but not with a big group of people. New kids usually feel uncomfortable when a group of people talk to them at one time. They usually like to talk to one person at a time until they know a lot of people. So just be yourself, and make the guy feel welcome. :)
2GiN0eDDaa	I'm only 16 too and like you i've only had one proper boyfriend.If the boys around you don't interest you then don't think about it there is no point having a boyfriend just for the sake of having one. if you stop looking and wait i'm sure a guy who you actually like and likes you back will come along. Also sometimes theres a guy right under your nose if you so lonely why not give the guys at your school a break, you have to remember they act like fools because they think it impresses people, maybe deep down there is someone there who's worth your time.|`|YGJfUi7xaa	Hey, I'm a 16 years old boy.

If he is more concerned about her than you, maybe he shouldve stayed married to her.|`|AA11521614	I am going through something similar. She will make his life hell until she can get a life herself! She will use the kids as a pawn. She's trying to run you away. let her evilness make your relationship stronger. No matter how ugly she is to you be nice to her so she can look and feel like the fool. DON'T LET HER WIN!  Be strong. Marriages are work and yours has already started.|`|CEPn9Shcaa	If he doesn't look for ways to solve problems which will make your lives together more enriched, you need to move on.  There is nothing worse than being in a partnership where the one partner's baggage is not dealt with in a fair and reasonable manner.|`|Hoo25kR1aa	You mean you have been going through this for 5 years?  He needs to stand up for you and if he doesn't,  then I believe it is time you do some serious thinking about this relationship.  Perhaps if his ex can find someone, she will leave you alone.  Nevertheless, she is using the child as a wedge between you two.  No matter what, they have a child together and that alone will bind them till the child is grown.  The ex needs to get over this and move on. Remember, that she is going to be in the picture till the child is grown.  You must have a serious talk with your boyfriend and communicate your feelings to him.  Maybe seeing a marriage counselor will help.  Please, get this settle before you say your I Do's.  I really do wish you the best of luck.

You're now dating the guy you couldn't keep your hands off of.  He HAD to stop things, or risk losing his license in the office.  After meeting you elsewhere, he was free to start dating you.  <br>  <br>  It does sound like you have a problem with impulse control.  If this has never been a problem before, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.  If it bothers you, see a psychologist.  <br>  <br>  I don't see why race would be a major issue.  He seems OK with dating you.  If you're OK with it, there is no problem.  If you're NOT OK with it, find a way to cope or break up with him.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy the ride.  Not many 20 somethings get to date successful doctors.

JgzAPKDSaa	You should never let someone of the opposite sex come between best friends.

The fact that you are repeating the same bad habits as your father, to the point where you see it, but can't control it almost sounds like a generational curse. I don't know if you have a religious background, but that's when bad habits are passed within a family, from generation to generation. <br>  I don't have all the answers, but I know exactly what you're going through, because I too am struggling with some things. You need help...you can't do it all by yourself and God doesn't expect you to. <br>  I'll tell you what; I am going to pray for you, and your strength, and the holding together of your marriage, and I need you to pray for you too. Have faith that day by day God will show you the way, and deliver you from your problem. Give it to him. Let him know that you are weak right now and need his strength in your life..He already knows it,,he is just waiting for you to ask. Good luck, and I hope everything goes alright.

Not your thing?<br>   OK how about cloth's, drapes, furniture or who is cheating on who. Boring!!!<br>  <br>  That leaves sex as the only topic of an interest that guy's can participate in with females.
j8EG1aAcaa	At least he is honest with you about his relationship with her. No, I think men and women have a very hard time moving on. I may take him years but the constant contact may not mean he is still messing around with her just that he still cares about her. Talk to him about it and tell him your concerns. See what happens|`|6XME4TiBaa	Reckon not, i still think about Vicki Whitlow a gorgeous girl i attended Peaster ISD with over 20 yrs ago I never dated her but would have in an instant|`|9BrV6UEGaa	most guys move on, but if there friend there friends you can't do much about that. and i think you need to think about the relationship in whole why was he in jail?|`|WpJBhrJ0aa	just like girls...you will move on if you want to

010ef9b50c10808a60f57cdcb8049d34aa	You have got to be patient. He seems to have gotten hurt pretty bad and things like that don't heal overnight or even over a month. If you really want to be with him, just be there for him, don't push him for anything and in time, he will come around. But at the same time, be smart. If it's really obvious that he doesn't want to be with you (and I mean obvious, not just a suspicion) then you'd best move on.|`|9106bc1f411c11f11592938557c8f854aa	if you really like him and care about him then you would do anything no to let him go|`|91e7c89658ab1125e7194d88b255c97eaa	Back away, but not all the way and see his response.  He may realize that he does want to go further if you don't put it out there as much.|`|660aa6a51134f19d7caa19852ef4be87aa	Its a valid excuse. For now back off and let him come after you because he WILL. He will miss you,realize how special you are and will begin to NEED you.Back off for a week or two and he'll be all over you like white on rice.Being a little mean works too.Dont be so nice.|`|9ETmeSHeaa	That actually is a valid excuse. It happened to me but I eventually gave in because she kept looking so sad every time I refused to acknowledge us as a couple. So far it's been working out but I hope you don't cheat on him because he sounds like a nice guy on the verge of morphing into a bad guy if he gets his heart broken again. If that happens then yet another bad guy with the knowledge of a nice guy will enter the world and break another girl's heart.|`|e1533accbcc28c987a387cfc873f55edaa	I think you have to have a heart to heart with him. If he isn't willing to start a new with you, then I say he is not for you. Time to move on. No reason to invest more time in a relationship going no where. Good Luck!!|`|5cfacb05bacbcb03e822574a5afed855aa	i can speak from experience. My boyfriend now! I have know him for about 4 yrs now for the first 2 yrs it was just sex because of the fact that he had just found out that his ex-gf was cheating on him so it took him a while to want to be in a relationship again so he had a hard time trusting that i was not going to do the same thing but until this day he still feels like I'm going to do what she did to him and in my opinion i think that he needs to work on his trust issues before you get involved with him cause it will only cause you problems later down the road with him so make sure that is what you want and if not move on and find someone who can trust you! and be secure with your relationship
Fkz9u1Rxaa	If you don't like it then tell him how you feel....and if you get jealous, put yourself in his shoes and imagine how hurt he would get if he knew you were also attracted to other women...remember a relationship works with two people and it works both ways. If you get jealous if he does something, then he will also get jealous if you do the same.|`|SN9gY4Toaa	If you are jealous in any way of this other woman you are going to have major problems in your relationship.|`|cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	I believe you need to clarify your explanation of the question because right now it is about as clear as mud.

You and ur man are considering a 3some with another woman but you think u'll b jealous and can't stand to c him touch her. <br>  My fiance and I have had this discussion and I had the same thoughts. Just set some ground rules. Like he cant touch her. Be specific. How we decided we'd work it is i would always be 'between' him and her. Or he would simply watch. Now we never did try a 3some so I don't know how well it would work but good luck|`|njcRMMm6aa	Then explain this to him. Ask him to be a spectator only, he will still get off on seeing you with another woman. But remember it is going to drive him nuts not being able to do both of you at the same time and he is going to bug the crap out of you for this.|`|OwPi3CIUaa	it will bring a lot of problems if you are serious with this man...

7907289434c1f7ebf28e7b83319e9abbaa	Actually, to be precise: a woman 'has a wall' when the man she loves treats her BAD. That's when she feels compelled to raise a 'wall' to defend herself and avoid to get hurt. So, what your ex gfs said to you does NOT add up, sounds more like a mere excuse instead;)...An advice? Keep treating women right, but pick better ones;)...as a non-stupid/shallow woman, I can tell you that I'd never ever go for a man who treats me bad;) Love is about respect, only idiots wouldn't understand it.|`|69052a01f1cd610794337f2bfdfa39f0aa	its not the women it you|`|lObEjUh1aa	asking why women do something is like asking what ingredients are in soup (it depends on the soup, and it depends on the woman too).<br>  <br>  not sure exactly what the scenario is, but i'm sure the reason will be different with every woman.  sounds like you want something (marriage?  commitment?  sex?) that she doesn't?  ask her about her feelings, and find out what her reasons are (she may have good ones).<br>  <br>  chances are that regardless of what she says, you're going to be left with a choice of staying in the relationship (and not getting whatever it is you are pursuing) or finding a woman who wants the same things you want.  personally i would choose the latter; it's easier and will make you (and your gf) happier in the long run.<br>  <br>  wish you luck :/

Often they make excuses about things they need to do then get caught up in little lies here and there.  Once that happens it generally begins the process of the other person trying to remove themselves from the relationship, OR staying with you while cheating to have his/her cake and eat it too!|`|HBovvkdkaa	You know in you're heart all ready.

AA11950652	id tell her im praying harder for it to happen to her first|`|kQBrQ8oiaa	I would inform her that wish will come true. We're all going to die someday, and that we're not meant to live forever, just a short loving life, and during this time we're being watched ever so closely by loved ones who have already passed over. What should be her main concern is what she plans on doing for her short life span? She should act as if she is on a movie production, one that everyone is seeing and will see, its a permanent production, one that she will review on the day that she dies, along with all her relatives and friends, and she's being recorded right now too, would she like to take a bow toward her fan club right now?|`|33239fc4cf3fcbc9a1c3cdf2c5ffca06aa	I would make sure that we had eye contact,  tell her that I knew that she was speaking out of anger and that  I would, now and forever, Love her unconditionally .|`|5pDcrjObaa	talk to her, ask her nicely on what's bugging her. Maybe its just some miss understanding. Maybe your too hard on her that's why she's saying that to you.|`|oDZrM9gvaa	Almost every child once in a lifetime tells their parents that they hate them (praying that you will die is most likely her way of expressing what she believes is hate at the moment) but that does not mean they do. Don't take her seriously even if it really hurts just be the wiser in the situation and try to understand why he or she is upset if there is in fact a reason.|`|yVgMPVzsaa	I think that your daughter doesnt mean when she said i pray that you die, its just part of her anger.<br>  Maybe you do things that she never like.<br>  Try to ask her seriously, to why shes acting this bad?<br>  are you not being a good mother to her?<br>  what did you do to her to hate you that much?<br>  Talk to her and not shouting. sometimes our daughter<br>  is acting what they have seen to us.<br>  Maybe she see you often nagging thats why she thinks<br>  this is normal thats why shes doing this to you.<br>  Be a good mother to her and im pretty sure that she will be a goo daughter to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck..;|`|AA12018418	Dear, before i answer this question i want to say two things....<br>  <br>  1. Either you have not taught your daughter properly how to behave and didnt really love her the way she needed<br>  2. Or, You never really had any inflluence on your daughter and she doesn't know the meaning of the word 'Mother'.<br>  <br>  Just go and talk to your daughter, but before that please do analyse your own fault if you did any. Make sure you have always been a very good mother. Talk to her softly and do apologise to her if you realize that there was any fault from your side. She will understand. You are her mother and you do know how she is...right?.....So dont hesitate. Love can change a lot of things in life. Apologising to your daughter would not degrade your personality....it would rather upgrade. Make everything alright before it gets worse.....Good luck
hU3bAEU2aa	THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP IS LOVE.KNOWING THAT SOMEONE LOVES YOU IS THE BEST FEELING YOU CAN EVER HAVE.|`|pKvxKACzaa	The interactions, THE SEX, the feelings, THE SEX, the cute moments, THE SEX!!!!!!!|`|FR2iFne8aa	That would depend on what type of relationship you are in.  There are people in relationships just for the sake of being in a relationship and nothing is great about that.  But, when you're in the "right" relationship with someone you love and care about, I don't think there is anything better.  You have a partner, best friend, someone to support you, someone to talk to, laugh with and have fun with.  There is nothing better once you find the "right" relationship for you.|`|Mlwd5Bt3aa	Honestly, it depends on the person.<br>  <br>  "What is can be said for one person can't be said for all"<br>  <br>  I like to be in a relationship because I'm really not independent and I'm not outgoing, so if I'm not in a relationship I'm a loner.  As for when I'm in a relationship I have someone around to vent and complain to and keep me sane from the day to day problems.<br>  <br>  The main thing that is "good" to me about a relationship is that you have someone to catch you and someone to lean on.  You expect them to be there for you and understand you and not judge you as a person.<br>  <br>  This is why I find it "good", but it can't be said for everyone.<br>  <br>  It's like assuming if one person likes meat we all like meat.<br>  But there are vegetarians.
AA11658856	Yes, and yes.  Maybe I was lacking self-confidence back in the day.  Good luck!|`|r4nCI4IBaa	yes, because i knew she didnt want a bf at the time. and then i lost my chance...|`|DlZJEvhFaa	Um, there is no such thing as lost your chance. You can always go back and right a wrong. But, if you wait too long,  that person may have found someone else. But, that doesn't always mean that that other person is truly what they want.<br>  Don't let your insecurities or your stubborness blow your chances in life. Being a risk taker, putting yourself out there is always the best thing. It's how people in our society have gotten what they want. Right down to poets, inventors, corporate execs....Life is all about taking chances and risks.<br>  Good luck,|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	It happen to me, well, sometimes guys dont express their emotions to the girl they love. especially physically. Girls want a guy who they can hug, or hold their hand in the park. you just have to know what the girl wants and give it. if not, ull lose ur chance|`|fFqewQOzaa	I don't think that men should talk about these sort of things. It's more a matter of doing and being honorable, instead of talking. <br>  <br>  Talking usually indicates a need and expecting love in return.
Mlwd5Bt3aa	You all sound like you are in high school, so relationships are kind of useless and infantile at that time of your life, but anyway.  You should just tell your friend.  You can't help who you fall for, it just happens, especially in high school.<br>  <br>  But seriously...that guy seems like a jerk.  I wouldn't never want to date a guy that openly calls someone ugly, that is just mean.  Even if he thinks it and he also said it about your friend.  If a guy called my friend ugly I'd be defensive.  As a friend I wouldn't want to be with a guy that will say something mean about my friend. That is just my opinion though.<br>  <br>  And your "enemies", yeah...this is high school for sure.  Anyway, those are your friends and you are her friend.  Should she sacrifce her friends to be your friend?  Aren't you sacrificing your friendship to date the guy she likes?  You can't complain about her, if you are contemplating doing the same thing to her.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :D|`|TDpB9Folaa	talk to your friend and ask if its ok if you pursue him...?maybe?|`|AA10675202	have him cloned,then you'll both be happy.|`|0417a2fd0e61a5577247d08fea90e8bfaa	tell her to her face|`|AA11541176	no, she will feel be trade since you got "her guy" and you stoled him from her....and this guys seems to be a guys that just dates and dumps and dosent take things seriously..so i would just keep my mind out of him and keep my friendship with my best friend|`|bc28fd30c2b01efbb09ce8d83cbba8c9aa	No guy (and this one sounds very 2-faced) is worth losing a friend over.

Don't go after him because:<br>  A. It will wreck your friendship with your friend<br>  <br>  B. Your heart might get broken by this guy.<br>  <br>  Just don't do it. Find someone else out there who doesn't have so many playing characteristics.|`|a030c800d4efa38e6b3963a3c1e33280aa	my advice is don't take him seriously because i doubt that he would take a relationship seriously based on the information u gave us. tell your friend what he told you, or if the guy wants to have something with you, tell him to tell her  that he likes you and tell him to ask her if she could help him  get with you.|`|jmfP8HHhaa	I think that if ur friend doesnt really care about u and hangs out with ur enemies, then u should be to worried about her feeling either. if u really like this guy, and he likes you, and he is a decent person then i think u should go for it. the reality is that it would be different if ur friend was more considerate about ur friendship, but since it appears she isn't t then too bad. you should definitely tell her that u kinda like the guy so it won't be a huge shock if she sees u guys together or hears about it from someone else. plus, u never know, maybe it wont be the end of ur friendship just cause u like this guy.. maybe she'll be a real friend and just be happy for you.|`|lpoI8jNeaa	you need to decide who is more important to you. who will make you more happy in life. chances are if your in high school or middle school in about 4 years you wont even know or care about either of these people. so my advise is do what will make you happy. in this situation, live in the moment && do whatever it takes to furfill your needs.<br>  <br>  --- i wish you the best of luck|`|vvWqKRikaa	First of all you can't fall in love with someone over myspace.

WHfA6ZXzaa	well depends on your age. when you are young it should be family then friends and so on like you said. but once you get into your early and mid twenties it becomes focused around your boyfriend or husband then family friends. but if your in your thirties i guess it become focused around your children then husband.|`|BpnwtzRaaa	Always my first priority goes to God.<br>  Then ofcourse my husband (wen i m  married that is)<br>  Then definetly family<br>  Then the next place goes to my friends.<br>  Last but not least my kin and kiths.<br>  Sorry I dont give any space in my world for bfs.|`|3IakLMfkaa	The chronology you had mentioned is the right one in my view point.|`|CDcYVyxhaa	i think that my gf will be always sweet and sexy . i want that she always fight with me but she will be not angry for a long time and last thing she will be love me a lot|`|cjKDMXS1aa	i think  the same family , friends, then yur bf or gf thats just the way it is
dd5c636338ed83b09026fd3d2bbcdb91aa	He probably likes both of you.  I'm sure he was embarrassed when you asked him such a direct question.|`|AA10221073	I agree with Colleen, he may be  the shy type. And when u asked him if he likes u it made it more awkward for him, he may stare becuase he thinks ur pretty andhe may want to say something but because he's to shy he can't bringhimself to do so.<br>  <br>  So try to understand it's a little hard for shy people to express themself.<br>  <br>  He may like the both of u girls he and even though he maybe  shy he's still a guy who enjoys the fact that two pretty girls are giving him attention.|`|63dbed235e024e415b8718b122d4af64aa	Sounds like he likes the other girl, yes. He may like you too. He also sounds confused. And unfortunately there is no way you can get inside his head and find out (wouldn't it be great if you could?). <br>  <br>  If you want to try talking to him about something like homework or some interest you both might have (music or something) - give it a try! If he likes you he will eventually have to do some of the paying-attention/talking etc. But I would also get on with your own life as they say in the magazines, and try not to worry about him too much (I do know, it is hard not to! but at least try and act cool on the outside!)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11595705	He probably likes both of you.  It sounds like you are fairly young, which is ok,  but boys sometimes can't or don't want to choose between two girls, and really, thats ok.  Just like it is ok if there is another boy you also like.  If he does like just you, and you like just him, that would be great for you, but if he doesn't, that is still ok, if you enjoy hanging out with him, keep doing it.  If you are both feeling the same, it will become known to you both.|`|SqIKRWlTaa	he might be shy and not wanna tell ya|`|aE7EPrxBaa	try talking to him hes probably waiting to see who acts first|`|bt5oJ4ujaa	He has no idea. He won't know who he likes until he's in his 30s if ever. Boys/men are crazy. The only person crazier is a girl/woman. Junior High and High School is a lot of fun but it's also a lot of uncertainty. Don't ask youself (or us) if he likes you. Ask yourself if you like him. If so, and I hate to give this advice, start to ignore him or at least don't come across like you're his for the taking. It's hard but it's good practice. People like people who have their own **** going on and aren't just waiting around for someone to choose them.|`|rQQ1zyDpaa	wow you don't know how similar this is to something that happened to me...its like, exactly what happened to me...the dance, asking him, the other girl...<br>  but anyways, like almost everyone else has said, he might like both of you and doesn't really want to choose...but unless he suddenly confesses that he likes you, i would keep going with your life and not focus on him 24/7, cuz (again, been there, done that) he might never decide, and you don't want to be tied down to a guy that is confused about this. best o luck!|`|uyeba32saa	I think that he moved on and began liking someone else. Not because there was anything wrong with you, but guys tend to lose interest faster than girls, so they like you one day and then find someone else the next. I think you should just push the crushing to the side and become friends. If the feelings come back, than thats great. If not, at least you didn't waste your time waiting for something that didn't happen.|`|zZuvrLLxaa	I think young guys in school are so childish. Maturity in regards to men take forever. It sounds like you may have scared him by asking him that. I think if you had another friend who is male to talk to for awhile it would create him to notice the stares and conversation are no longer his and would get his attention. If nothing else just work on having fun in school and the rest will fall into place. Create within youself as a young girl a little selfishness, place yourself first, create a confidence that you deserve better and others will notice. Of course keep in mind the feelings of others and be a kind person.
566JFfOwaa	you could get him a small bottle of cologne or make him something... im sure he would appreciate that!|`|z5lfq31vaa	You could get him a cheap necklace or ring.<br>  Or ask someone if you can borrow money and pay them back.
VMURujkeaa	well wut i am going to say is that dont be around her 24/7 and + u live with her and trust me i got tired of my room mate right after he moved in lol and he wasnt around me 24/7 so u better do it fast dont be around her too much it might rul ur friendship!|`|r4oC8KkCaa	You guys should have some set time limits for along time. So say from 6-8 you can go somewhere and give her time alone, which also gives you a chance to hang out with other people (and gives her a chance to miss you!)|`|AA10520412	What do you think you should do?  Not be around her 24/7 for starters.  No one wants to be around someone every minute of the day.  Get a life and get away from her once in awhile.  You are going to ruin your friendship if you don't.
nPwW23qvaa	beauty lies :p in the eye of the beholder.<br>  <br>  any girl who looks like my mom is nice.<br>  <br>  i've always been attracted to girls who are kinda diffrent from me<br>  <br>  sweet and caring and  talkative (dosent gossip too much though)<br>  <br>  <br>  smart enough to be my equal partner in life|`|EFM5nn9daa	Wow this is so SUBJECTIVE. That means that different girls are appealing to different types of men.  It you want to know about love. You fall in love with women not only because you think they are beautiful but many other things, like personality, charisma, intelligence.<br>  But I have to stick with guys being pigs and very simple minded.  SO some of the first attractions to a woman have to be their looks and their bodies, but the other traits come into play after we know you.  So if your ugly your best chance is with a guy who's been your friend or has gotten to know you.  If you get alot of attention from alot of guys then I would have to say you are pretty or have a nice body.  If guys don't give you alot of attention then you might not be that pretty or have a nice body.  Sorry guys tend to be shallow and pigs but hey that's what makes you like us.

AhFhek9daa	Maybe it is time for you guys to have a serious conversation about what you expect from each other and the near future together. He has a great opportunity and if he feels you are the one for him, he will be satisfy with a good opportunity where you guys can be together. If he doesn't feel that way or is unsure then it means he should go. In any case you guys need the big talk about you and where this relationship is heading, if of course this is alerady serious and not a 3 months or even 6 dating realtionship...<br>  <br>  I like your mentality, you seem the very generous kind to want to let him go away from you for his best, so make sure you also protect yourself a bit in this...|`|c86b2c8948f38551c3c71b2587082c13aa	Is there any way you can go with him?

DlZJEvhFaa	Confront him on his immature behavior. Adult guys who look at young girls to get off are borderline pedophiles. And, probably unhappy in his life and wishes to be younger. If his behavior does not change, then, get out of the relationship.<br>  This guy sounds like a loser to me.|`|xFif6Qyuaa	he obviously doest love you and thinks your cheap and worthless and stupid and dumb so id dump him
eaP6U4y0aa	lt sounds like he is trying to get a reaction out of you if you believe he likes you.  he is trying to see if he can provoke any jealousy to see if you like him.  Have you told him how you feel because then once you tell him he'll be like hey she does like me and then he'll go for it.|`|abbd790861dff7f18e40d591c583f02eaa	Maybe he feels comfortable in confiding in you. Maybe he just feels like you two should be friends, even though he likes you. Either way I would be put too much time into him, it seems like he doesn't really want more than friendship.|`|AA12244330	a. he's trying to make you jealous<br>  b. he needs a friend to talk to
zIv7kCubaa	no thanks|`|gkczQH0Naa	yes i do the love of my life|`|A6MkuO5Xaa	I love a gentleman. I wish I could go back to the 1800s where courtship was not so vulgar and men were so gallant. So, yeah, I would like a nice guy... as long as he has a wild side as well.|`|OWHwYBEzaa	Of course. I wish all men were still gentlemen. They need to quit staring at my booty and giving cheesy pick-up lines.|`|SsVLGd1waa	Well, you can be NICE and hmmmmm....an animal at the same time.<br>  <br>  Nice doesn't have to equate with DULL.<br>  <br>  So yes, I'll take a nice guy any day.  Mean guys suck.
3yEIUtARaa	try switching positions a few times during sex to help you last longer. and go down on her before sex to help her climax at around the same time as you|`|AA10027023	yes that is normal.. usually the girls orgasm takes longer to get and it also last longer... and the guys *** fast cause we are HORNY!!   :D|`|AA12393776	its a little on the short side<br>  she is a little on the quick side.<br>  <br>  probably more forplay for her, to try and even timing out.<br>  <br>  you might consider a thicker condom.  there are some creams.  some think of baseball.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest just slowing down or stopping for a min or so.<br>  <br>  the books say 20min is average.|`|14338a5a4d8a75f4a145dd4902283c32aa	that sounds about average. if you stop right before you are going to finish and wait a minute then start again you should be able to go longer. or some guys will take care of themselves before hand (a few hours or so) so they can last longer. good luck|`|AA12303215	Try a thicker condom to dull more of the sensation  But if it is working for you and your girl, just go with it.
Mlwd5Bt3aa	My boyfriend is like that.  He won't ever tell me something is bothering him and says that is how he deals with things.  Yeah, it's not nice and it hurts, but you need to let him know that it hurts and you have to make it known that you are interested in his life and problems.  This is what I told my boyfriend after awhile:<br>  <br>  "I know that you don't want to bother me or dump your problems on me because you don't want me to worry, but I want to be the one that you lean on and go to when you are down.  Wouldn't you want the same from me?  I love you a lot and the fact that I'm not needed like that makes me feel unimportant and I know that is selfish, but it makes me happy to know that I can help you."<br>  <br>  My boyfriend got mad at first but then he told me the day after that I was right and he was being stubborn.  Now, I still have to pry info from him, but he doesn't keep it from me.  Just know that he isn't trying to make you sad or leave you behind, he is honestly trying to make you happy by keeping you from having to deal with it.  Also, men tend to feel un-masculated by not being able to take care of you or sharing their feelings, but if he doesn't listen to you, you just need to make it known that he is hurting you.  Communication is what it is all about.<br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question :D|`|AA10792539	he doesnt have problems to share with you,,he is cheating ,,dump him|`|28e0c0f430bed21c8a227b061b9514a1aa	wake up sister. get moving on. there is nothing for you here.|`|56iSphlGaa	This is a one sided relationship. You need to be involved with someone who can give to you all that you give. If he is blocking you out then its time to move on there is no reason why except he is not committed to you. It seems harsh and unfair but after 4 yrs you should be completely in twined in his life and If your not its time to go.|`|ced7983869f77f398e88b804e891ecfeaa	Its pretty hard for a guy not to be the money maker, offering to pay for things just hurts and attacks his pride, making him feel like less of a man.<br>  <br>  He sounds pretty screwed internally, so pressuring him will do more harm then good.  You might want to sit him down in a shadowed room, and talk quietly to him, it might help him to open up.  Do not push and do not speak of emotions, just talk and listen about his problems, and never take them to anyone else.<br>  <br>  He needs to feel he can trust you, cause right now his experience with women means they are all untrustable, money stealing, bit&*s<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps
AA10811487	of course you should tell him. You should miss the chance, he might be the love of your life and you don't want to miss it, do you?|`|YOHp2PWkaa	grow up|`|QbDzJjLWaa	You should definitely tell him if he really notices you then he would probably give you a chance.|`|XncnB15haa	you should tell him because hemight feel the same way about u but then again if he doesnt like u hell probably just want 2 ur frnd and youll feel shy when u get around him|`|dDmEow9Jaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HIM. IT MIGHT BE A POSSIBLITY THAT HIM MIGHT LIKE YOU TO. I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HIM. TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL. AND IF HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU THEN JUST FIND YOU SOMEONE ELSE. BUT YALL COULD STILL BE GOOD FRIENDS.|`|e5QDBcYRaa	well if there has been any signs that he likes you the n you should do it instead of keeping your feelings bottled up!<br>  <br>  goodluck-Veronica
ya3jM8Kyaa	wait until he breaks up with her because otherwise you'll be putting him in an uncomfortable situation where he has to choose between the two of you|`|6437ab94abc30db5ad96637380a75ea1aa	Well just wait and still be his best bud. But be warned that when you do tell him if he does not have same feeling then it will make it very awkward for you and he might act different around you. Also if you do get into more with him and it does not work then you might end up loosing your best bud guy friend. So just wait till he is single again and don't try to ruin his current relationship. Be his friend and if you want be there to help pick up the pieces if they break up lol.|`|XiX7alYjaa	how old are you?
566JFfOwaa	If she cheated on you she is not worth it anyway, find someone you can trust.|`|37R1qdWBaa	sorry gotta agree with the person who sent you advice there..get rid of her she is not worth it.
AA11323693	Doesn't matter if you are getting ahead of yourself or not. <br>  <br>  If he asked where you were, then it means that he has noticed you - does this mean romantically? maybe maybe not (probably though he is a life guard and I'm assuming you wear a swimsuit to go to the pool right?) <br>  <br>  This is what you do, go up to him, and ask him out - or for his number whichever you are more comfortable with (I suggest asking him out) why? because guys love it when a chick makes the first move (at least I would and most of the guys I know would think it was cool at the very least). <br>  <br>  There are only two possibilities, either A. he goes out with you (I think this is MUCH more likely because he has noticed you and I think he will respect you for making the first move) or B. he isn't interested for a variety of reasons. <br>  <br>  Being rejected isn't a big deal trust me you learn to go up and make the first move you will have 2 times as many yes answers than no answers.  (Guys love this trust me)<br>  <br>  Good luck my dear and I hope this helps.|`|eaP6U4y0aa	hmm...hard to tell if he ask for you again approach him girl...sounds cute though..you know whole lifeguard thing.
XSvyidDGaa	maybe because you made him realize who he really is? and he was not ready to accept who he really is?|`|VMURujkeaa	well maybe just because thathe loved u too much?
7ba02587e413f81d9e7e760489ded3e5aa	You've got yourself psyched out.  Instead of trying to get a date or a phone number, start with little steps.  Talk to a woman just for the sake of saying "hi."  Practice making eye contact and saying "hi," or "how's it going, " to women you pass on the street.  Practice with the check out girl at the grocery store.  Just keep your expectations realistic, and work on gaining confidence before gaining a date.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12041870	You are afraid of rejection.  Maybe you aren't quite ready for the dating scene yet.|`|AA12122351	stop bein a weenie....ask her out...nerd!!!!!!!!|`|GeDAv9Y6aa	I'd really like a good answer for this question because I feel the same. It is very difficult for me to approach women. I think I need more self confidence.|`|q1UwAdQ5aa	because, you are going over there with a great excitement and lot of tension wht will happens, but after going over there in that excitement you are in a thinking that you may not do properly or may fail and you are getting cold, so when you approach a woman, just be in a relax and jolly mood and dont make it as a big topic before your friends for going to a woman, ok, have a nice time|`|xlncSWP8aa	Are you afraid or rejection? Just realize that rejection happens to everyone and just because if you get rejected doesnt mean that your not a worthy person. Have confidence in yourself! Know your good qualities, and give yourself some credit. Im sure other women will take notice if you have confidence in yourself. And who knows, maybe a woman will approach you.
wUvAKOZWaa	I know it's hard...you cry when time to go away and call her to come back please but time makes the difference. It's only 3 weeks. Call her on the phone whenever u r free and make sure she's ok. To let her know how much you miss and love her is just a phone call away. Do some stuff for you...amuse yourself, focus on your books if you're still at school. Don't cry a lot. It only hurts both of you.|`|XGJ12msgaa	call her once in awhile. spend time with friends or family. do some hobbies that u have.|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	get a picture and bring it around with you
6g10aaAdaa	do something funny and needs laugh and scream. playing in the roller coaster for example. and if that's not work, try to chat with paper, she will feel silly and try to talk much than write.|`|51Ib0kxVaa	If you've been going out for only one week then frankly you cannot possibly know whether you love each other yet.  Love takes time to grow.  However, you might be very interested in each other and like each other.<br>  <br>  As you talk on msm why not ask her out for lunch.  That's less scary than an evening date.  Just say, how about Sunday lunch tomorrow and take her somewhere where they do a roast dinner.  Or take her for a picnic in the park if the weather is nice. Just take along some sandwiches and crisps.  Hold her hand. Don't fret too much about lack of talking on your part or her part.  Maybe even tell her you are a bit shy about it too.  <br>  <br>  At the moment you are just meeting when her friends are around, therefore it's no wonder that you are both hardly talking and shy.|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	start with simple greetings! like "hi"<br>  then! try a question next time "how are you" <br>  then! you can talk and not be shy anymore|`|AA12054551	you're dating for a week? you don't know each other yet...try with the most simple things like...how was your day?or...where would you wanna go (that can make the effect of: what are your favourite places)? what would you wanna do (what do you like doing)?some questions that could give you the image of her interests, so you can find something in common...start talking about something you've always wanted to do, something you've always wanted to see...maybe it would make her give her own opinion, and when she does...that's more that a good start...<br>  my point is:simple questions, get to know each other better<br>  good luck<br>  kisses
2D6C9ANdaa	i have a friend just like this.<br>  She just follows us around and shys away. I've been trying to get her to talk to others, too. Ill tell you what I tell her. Don't worry about it. Be yourself. I bet you were expecting that too.<br>  But is there a reason you're shy? Insecure maybe? whatever it is, (say you dont think you're attractive enough, smart enough, ect) just tell yourself you are.<br>  You are amazing!<br>  If you show that, other people will accept you, and if they don't, they arent worth being friends with anyways.|`|k2dPKIgeaa	just be your self  talk to who ever u feel comfortable I'm just like u but i don't really care about how many friends i have just as long has i have them|`|tej0jGXQaa	I had a really shy friend who usually only hung out with this 1 girl well the girl left the school so me and my friends "adopted her" The past few years she's been more outgoing than ever. I guess if you want to be more outgoing you have to be arround outgoing people|`|HpIF4TeAaa	A good hairstyle and few new out fits help to make people feel a bit more confident when they know they're looking good. Give it a try. Get real cute and go out. discover your interests and talk them up and try to relate to the people around you and their interests. Anybody and everybody has something interesting about themselves so whatever your thing is talk it up. Ask people lots of simple questions and stay up beat. Smile :) <br>  <br>  People love talking about them selves, so if you ask questions people will see you as out going and it leads them to asking the same questions back to you. Then you get to know people and they get to know you!|`|PfrUfwBlaa	get confidence jk<br>  <br>  stand tall and make urself standd out or just hide it...very few of my friends know how shy i really am and i hide it well, make it funny...like when meeting new ppl say hi and then run like a kid away and then come back and be like sorry, i still feel like a kid sometimes
YbY2EbDkaa	Let your gut tell you..|`|094aeb51fddd6738244640604bb4b38daa	You won't be able to tell because girls are too chicken to come tell you that they "like" you.|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	if you talk to her and she talks back, and ur conversation lasts for minutes, then there is a chance she likes you|`|0q8UhyTFaa	There is no magic that you can use to find out. As guys, we can be pretty thick about this sort of stuff. We think women are interested in us when they're not and not interested in us when they are. Assuming that there is no one else in the picture, here is an approach that might work. Find an event that you can make an open ended invitation to. What I mean by that is that it is suggested in such a way that it does not sound like a date and she would not think that a no would hurt your feelings. (If she thinks your feelings would be hurt if she said no, she is likely to say yes and then not show up.)<br>  <br>  Here is what I mean by an open ended invitation.<br>  <br>  A bunch of friends of mine are - having a party - going to the amusement park - whatever. It's going to be fun and I think you'd have a good time. If you feel like coming along, we are all meeting up at - wherever.<br>  <br>  You are not asking her out. You are not saying it is really important to you etc. If she is available and says no, she probably doesn't want to hang with you. If she says yes, you will know that at least she thinks your company might not be too bad.<br>  <br>  Of course there is always a much simpler approach, you could always just ask her if she is interested in you.|`|AdQ0tmUpaa	tell someone to ask her if she likes you

4ba26ab50f3be7d8c6d639fa3af7e9f8aa	Mushy gushy = not really likely, if it hasn't happened yet. That's the kind of thing that's either part of his personality or not. If he hasn't shown it yet, then that's probably your answer. And asking someone to change their personality is not very nice, since that's kind of like asking them to be someone else. You like him as he is, right?<br>  <br>  How do you know if he still loves you? How is he treating you? I don't mean just alone, but around others, too. If he treats you right, both alone and with others, then ask him. I don't mean just blurt out, do you still like me. I mean, when he gets that far-away look, go, are you thinking about me? Smile! Spend time! Tell him you're thinking about him. If he can't answer that, then guard your heart, and remember, he still has some growing to do.<br>  <br>  Kissing = wait for the right time. Yeah, wait. I know, it doesn't seem right, but you'll be glad if you find the right moment rather than just randomly laying one on him. What if you do it in front of the wrong people? What if either of you is really uncomfortable because of where you did it and never want to do it again? It's about building comfort between yourselves. Besides, if you're worried that he doesn't like you anymore, do you think kissing him is gonna fix that? Probably not, so better to find that out first. (Because I'm a responsible adult, I should say... kisses and hugs are just fine! :)<br>  Hope that helps!|`|8c21901f1ceff458aaee34639d61afa9aa	i know you don't want to hear this but don't force anything with him. it might be years before you find the love you want but it will come. think about your future and let the rest happen. that is how you need to look at this...|`|G7dvZtAZaa	You just posted this exact same question with a different heading.<br>  <br>  The problem is it's too many questions and they're all so obvious.

6486d805c7376b91ac13c160d1845727aa	Honestly, you're probably the better man for her, but you must maintain your friendship with her until she decides on her own to end the relationship with him.  Be there to support her and listen to her.  She needs a trusted friend now more than anything.  You must refrain from laying your feelings all out there on the table.  Things have to happen naturally and the way it was meant to be for it to be true and meaningful.  She shouldn't want to be with you only because she's having problems with her BF.  That's no way to start a new relationship.  Let her see how good of a friend you are and who you really are as a person.  There's no harm in that..........|`|IoJUAtaFaa	atleast start out by comforting her, encouraging her, and being her freind.  she'll trust and rely on you then look where you are|`|AA12303215	If you really love her, tell her.

Mlwd5Bt3aa	He has a girlfriend, you shouldn't be trying to get him, because you'll run into trouble. Also, why would you want a guy that is already taken?  If if doesn't work your way, he probably won't talk to you and his girlfriend won't be happy with you either.  If you steal him away, which many happen if you tell him, you'll be known as a skank.  Plus, you are kind of young to be looking for love.  Wait till you are at least in high school to get yourself involved in a relationship so you can mature a little bit more.  At this age in life you aren't fully aware of yourself and also aren't able to make the more appropriate decisions.|`|H51UD0vlaa	Be a kid play with barbie dolls and date when ur 16 thats 4 yrs.

vMv4fCdRaa	It sounds like you are having children before you know the female well enough to start a family. That is the larger concern. Please learn from your past experience. Perhaps put forth a lot of effort into the relationship you are in now, and do your best to make things work. If you are not going to be happy after sincere effort, then yes get out of the relationship with the women. Make your children your priority and not another female.|`|AA10324805	No you are not wrong.

Show her constant affection. When your in a group of people make sure you make her feel special. Leave her little notes in little unexpected places. She will be really happy when she finds them. Always be honest with her. It takes a long time for people to regain trust after someone has lied to them.Call her just to see what she is doing? It shows your thinking about her. For you even to post this question you must really love this girl I wish you the best.

Can he compromise. I don't know exactly how he is controlling or if he is because your not specific on how he controls, however, all these questions and more can better guide you and allow you to see if it's something you like or don't.

AA12022874	No, try not to masturbate.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to marry a man in the near future, then you would have to violate the rule for the arranged marriage. If your parents have not yet even begun planning this, it sounds like it will take some time.

ee546c6473b7158229ae377c91f8d44baa	Cómo saber si le gustas a una chica <br>  <br>  La mirada: Cuanto más te mire a los ojos y sobretodo a la boca, más probable es que le gustes. Si te mira de forma rápida y quita la mirada cuando la miras, más puntos.<br>  <br>  La inclinación de la cabeza: Si te mira inclinando la cabeza a un lado o moviendolo de un lado al otro, mostrando el cuello, buen síntoma.<br>  <br>  Orientación y distancia del cuerpo: Cuanto más próximo y de frente esté su cuerpo con respecto al tuyo, mucho mejor. Si te está dando el lado del cuerpo, es menos probable que le gustes.<br>  <br>  Caricias a uno mismo: Esto es más típico de chicas. Si se está acariciando el pelo, brazos o manos, es al menos, símbolo de que se encuentra muy agusto contigo.<br>  <br>  Los manos en las caderas: Significa actitud de valentía, coqueteo, de estar dispuesto a la acción. Es muy buena se?al si está relajada contigo, si está enfadada… protégete para un posible golpe!! jeje<br>  <br>  Preguntas sobre ti: Cuanto más preguntas te haga interesándose por ti o tu vida (tu nombre, si tienes novia, etc) más probabilidades de que le gustes.<br>  <br>  Propuesta de cita o actividad: Por supuesto, si te propone una cita a solas, o cualquier actividad a solas, las probabilidades son muy buenas de que le gustas, al menos quiere conocerte más.<br>  <br>  Justifica su conducta sin pedírselo. Por ejemplo está contigo, va al servicio con sus amigas y te avisa que no te vayas que ahora viene. Si te da razones o justificaciones sin pedírselas y a otros chicos no, son puntos para que le gustes.<br>  <br>  Caricias: Si te hace una caricia, o te toca, aunque sea levemente en tu mano, o donde sea. Si le tocas y seguidamente te toca, suben mucho las probabilidades.<br>  <br>  Conversación: ella procura mantener conversación, especialmente cuando el ritmo decae. Te pregunta tu opinión, y si ésta es sobre ella misma… más puntos.<br>  <br>  Tiempo a solas: Cuanto más tiempo esté contigo a solas, sin sus amigas/os, más posibilidades hay de que le gustes.<br>  <br>  Humor, bromas: Cuantas más sonría, más bromas gaste y juegue a meterse contigo, te llame con apodos como “chiqui”, “peque”, “malo”, “golfo” etc. más posibilidades.<br>  <br>  NO Brazos cruzados: Si tiene los brazos cruzados NO es un buen momento para intentar nada (aunque puede ser que se sienta nerviosa a tu lado y se proteja psicológicamente así).<br>  <br>  Si se sonroja: Esto es algo muy sutil, pero si es así o se pone nervioso/a contigo, es una buena se?al<br>  <br>  pero ahora tengo algo mejor, un link que contiene:<br>  <br>  Recursos de seducción <br>  Ligar por Internet.

Eres el que la conoce, sabes cuáles son sus virtudes, sus defectos.  Si ella contigo es cari?osa, comprensiba pues es porque en realidad le interesas... puede que con los demás tenga otra actitud porque es posible que no le guste mucho sociabilizar o tendrá algún problema. A lo mejor debes demostrarle que la quieres sinceramente... Habla con ella y pongan sus puntos de ver las cosas, lo que les gusta a cad uno y lo que no les gusta; muchas parejas terminan una bonita relación por la falta de comunicación.

H7XligMkaa	I too, like "Me" have similar situations.  It seems like when it rains it pours with the "life" situations. My boyfriend and I were hopeful and being strong for each other at one time.  Now it seems like I am the only one with the hope.  At times I feel that if he would just let me know that he is still hopeful and that he is still strong with me, I would feel better.  So, I have taken on being strong for both of us, because I love him.  If you love this person, stay strong for him and you.  Have faith that all the "stuff" will eventually pass.|`|9tM93X1Xaa	I'm in a similar situation, and I can't speak for others, but for me, if she would just do something out of the ordinary to let me knoe she gave a rats A$$ about me, and may have more than a friendly interest, it would brighten my world. hope that helps.
irFognpCaa	i would say no. there's probably sex involved.|`|le2BsaKnaa	There isn't a problem in a 16 year old person liking a 13 year old person, but there is no way that it would be right for the 16 year old to ask the 13 year old out. You can like anyone of any age (that is, unless you are of the same gender then that's just wrong) but you don't necessarially have to ask that person out. As long as those two don't date, there is no problem.|`|7HAhcaIuaa	I don't think its a problem because i am 13 and i used to date 16 years old girls so nothing is wrong

qzzU576baa	Have you tried talking to their parents? Cops may be overdoing it. Why don't you tell the 2 boys yourself to stop comming into the yard. They might not listen to your son as much as they listen to an adult. Seriously. Take some parental action and talk to them in a serious tone. freak em out.|`|72303caf5b2d37601bc4e3133e623530aa	the next time they attack your son call the police the can at least tell to the other parents and will have record of this and that it has been going on<br>  <br>  they can not jump the fence that is trespassing <br>  <br>  kids can be smart as8es  at that age and it must come from home<br>  <br>  you may want to call the police and see what you can do now<br>  <br>  shame people do not raise their kids to respect others|`|4a132c583855e45ae43b50ea53eb0fc1aa	First, talk to the parents. Let them know that Corbin and Kyle are not to step foot on your property without your permission. Place no tresspassing signs along that side of the property if you can (though it is not necissary). Once your fence is in you might think of planting some blackberries or roses along it. If you decide not to do the fence you can do them instead. Kids don't like to jump into thorny plants. You can also get motion sensor sprinklers. The kids will jump over and get sprayed by the sprinkler. They might like it in the summer but they'll hate it in the winter.<br>  <br>  If there has been violence between Jeremy and Corbin or Kyle, that has been initiated by Corbin or Kyle, you can try to get a RO (restraining order). That will keep Corbin and Kyle from going on your property.<br>  <br>  You should also talk to Corbin and Kyle yourself. Tell them that if they go onto your property they are tresspassing - even if there is not a sign. Explain to them that you purchased the property and that what they are doing is unlawful. Make sure they know that you will be documenting each time they come onto your property and calling the police.<br>  <br>  Keep these kids away from Jeremy.<br>  <br>  GL!|`|AA10366433	yes you can.  You can also tell the parents of the boys that you would like to have some privacy and prevent the kids from fighting.  If the parents treated you badly when you inform them, that's the time you file a complaint.|`|j7FjHvbeaa	I would try to talk to the parents and see if they can stop it. It really sounds like these kids are brats. if that dioesn't work I would definitely call the  cops.|`|oJq50mZfaa	Next time you see the boys in your yard, talk to them yourself...and tell them if this behavior continues, that you will talk to their parents. They are probably trying to get a rise out of your son. They may react differently when confronted by an adult...

a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	shy, nervous, lack of money, lack of car, bad self image|`|Fl8gAGiRaa	Not calling someone you like could be many reasons.

FUDntY8paa	There are a lot of women out there that "just want to be friends", why is it so hard for women to understand when a man wants to be friends?  Maybe he just isn't ready.  Boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but good friends are around all the time.|`|SGLGmvn3aa	Every situation is hard to judge, so you need to determine,<br>  <br>  but I was only friends with my girlfriend for 9 months before we got together, always doing nice things for her, and I loved her the whole time, I was just scared to tell her|`|ab69d57a4531d3b1223a31844c276e0eaa	Maybe it is just the term "dating" is worrying him he is equating it to something more. It sounds like you already have a really positive relationship with him. The relationship talk or the "where are we going with this" might have just hit him at the wrong time. It's if your having a good time just be patient.|`|sCOAEQgwaa	Give him time, you do not know if he has been burned before and cannot handle the heartbreak if he gets into another relationship.<br>  I would personally give him 6 months to 9 months and if things do not proceed by then, then he either has someone or he is just not interested.<br>  Sometimes guys do just need a friend you know....do not push or he will go away.|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	sounds like hes just not ready yet

HvNBemNcaa	Do something on a date that will make you both comfortable, something that you like.  A funny movie, a casual fun place to eat.  Maybe a waterpark.  Something where you may not think so much and just be able to relax.  Hopefully than one of you will take the initiative and make the first move.|`|7r9I4mNraa	if you are both shy, well, one of you has to make the other more comfortable.<br>  <br>  so just do something he likes and he'll be comfortable.|`|1IZs66UBaa	First of all, it really depends on how much you talk in person. If you talk a lot in person, start asking him questions about himself. He will eventually open up because most guys like to talk about themselves.|`|KjyNnTn6aa	just take a couple dates slowly.  don't go straight into an extreamly fancy restaurant where he'll have to watch every single thing he does.  try a laid back dinner to a casual place, then maybe a movie.  after that, just work up.  eventually you'll be able to have that perfect date
d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	I am not a deeply religious person, but I will still give you my take on the situation.  Verbal abuse can be just as damaging as physical abuse when it comes from a parent.  I just don't think you should force yourself to get along with someone, even your mom, just on the basis of God.  You should sit down with her and share your feelings with her.  State that the demands and the insults must end if she wants to continue having a relationship with you.  No one should have to go through life as a beaten dog.|`|FPJNWOE6aa	try telling her how you feel or suggest counseling so that you have a more open relationship|`|EQKRDCVuaa	I'm going through the same thing.... I've found that kindness kills. I mean that we must turn the other cheek and keep a happy face on ( even if fake). It works for me.
zIv7kCubaa	I dont know maybe she has a reason not to.<br>  not all girls are like that.|`|GJqkSs7Eaa	depends on many factors.  By "talking" do you mean really talking in person or on the phone, or online (chat, text, IM).  Depends on the age and/or maturity level.  The real trick is that some girls get scared and run away if they really like a guy while others,if they aren't interested, will disappear.  <br>  <br>  Ahhhhh - isn't it grand!  You have to do what your heart says.  I'm in a peculiar situation myself at the moment, and I have to do what I think is right.<br>  <br>  Most people are probably going to say "Talk to her about it" and while that is important, you will still be left with some emotional response - that's where the real answer lies!|`|a83AXe9taa	maybe she doesnt want to look desperate|`|ibJYImbqaa	i didnt know we do that.........i dont think i do that........|`|qNQEx4nGaa	not all girls are like that you know. but if you do decide to dump them you should do it now before feelings get hurt, that is the considerate thing to do. maybe they don't deserve to be hurt you know?|`|dDmGGHs6aa	Girls sometimes come on strong at first all excited about getting to know a guy, then when the pursuit is over (they have you hooked)  they back off. It is a real sign of immaturity.<br>  Sometimes girls(guys do this too) do it to get you to dump them so they don't have to do it. Just like guys , the girl may have just changed her mind about who they like and they are moving on hoping you get the point with no hard feelings(confrontation issues). <br>  My best advise is if you are pursuing a relationship and they are giving you the shrug, and she is important to you confront her by asking if everything is okay , or if it is new and you are feeling toyed with.. Move on(dump them with tact because other girls find out and may use it against you if you don't) and let them know you have (put on a strong front so they don't have the power thinking you are crushed).<br>  Life is difficult enough. Everyone deserves to feel wanted and  secure!
e45cfb13d782c1072ccd8197e0176696aa	firstly age is just a number yeah! so don't worry about that, secondly, just don't get too emotionally involved with him if you know what i mean ever heard the saying treat em mean keep em keen? go with that, and you'll be fine! lifes too short to worry, go with your heart and nothing else. if you both really do have feelings for each other you'll both know trust me!<br>  good luck hun! feel free to email if ya want any more advice.<br>  xxxx|`|r0tNCZoSaa	just go for it, sort the rest out if needed later, might turn out to be fantastic. if not what a memory|`|iOseIQhraa	I have to say, in terms of you getting hurt, be very careful and before you get too far with him, find out what he actually wants out of you.  A relationship, a bed buddy, or a quick snog.  Then decide if you're comfortable with the role he wants you in.  If you are, then you shouldn't have to worry about the pace.  If you aren't, tell him!  The age difference doesn't matter, and how you perceive yourself doesn't matter.  To him, you could be the most beautiful person on the planet.  Just because you don't fall under what society dictates as beautiful, doesn't mean he sees it the same.  After all, take a look back over the years at how models have changed.
AA12055307	It could be love, or something in between both. He is probably afraid to ask because he is shy, maybe lacking self confidence, thinking he'll never be with her, but to me it seems like there is definately some attraction there.|`|8ed7fc32be357df1555f1b6d2a1130b2aa	All of those signs are it.

THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT SHE ASKS YOU, SHE USUALLY WANTS TO TELL YOU HER ANSWERS. JUST DON'T BE A DICK AND ASK HOW SHE LIKES IT IN BED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT! MOST GIRLS DON'T LIKE THAT. THEN IT SEEMS THAT YOU ONLY WANT SEX.|`|tE8RmWRMaa	I like to be asked what my interests are, if I have a project I'm working on, what I don't like, my life in general. And I like to be told about what he likes, about his childhood, secrets he has. {but the trick to telling secrets -tell her something that is imprtant, but it wouldn't bother you if she told someone else. It lets her know that you trust her and she might even tell you something in return!} Anything that keeps my attention. Just don't ever talk about sports unless SHE brings it up. I hate sports and they bore me to death. Good luck! ^^

ULyIoNo5aa	Crees que el físico lo es todo?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Quizás al leer esta frase dirás: Si si.. todos los feos se excusan con eso... PUES NO. Hace falta decir que una persona tiene algo más que piel... Es más las cosas importantes son las que están detras de la piel..

Otro amigo (guapo) me dijo, yo me casè con una fea, porque si estuviera con una bonita hace rato ya sería un cachudo.<br>  Yo pienso que las mujeres tambièn tienen miedo a estar con un guapo que pueda ser un mujeriego empedernido que las haga sufrir y por eso aceptan al feìto que jamàs les serà infiel. Y luego cuando conocen màs al feìto descubren que tiene un gran corazòn y sus virtudes borran sus defectos.<br>  Yo te cuento que soy gay, y no soy fea, he estado con hombres bien guapos, pero el que me robò el corazòn es un chatito, feìto, y todos me preguntan què le has visto.

LpbrVHzSaa	i guess it makes sense, i love naps, my bf thing is me been lazy, but w/e, and i understand your girlfriend, i usually take naps before going out or hanging with friend and my night go great no fight, no problems, just smooth, so in a way it makes sense lol.|`|Y072RbS0aa	LMAO... I'm sorry but this is hilarious... is she your mommy or something? <br>  <br>  You shouldn't have to take naps if you don't want to or don't have time! If she HAS to nap before you go out, maybe there's a reason for that? Does she get bored with you... or is her energy level really that low? If this is how she is now, imagine what will happen later, later, later on... maybe her naps will get longer or maybe she will need 2 a day. <br>  <br>  I do agree though, if people napped once in a while, it is a great re-energizer. But it shouldn't be mandatory... if you listen to her and nap every single time before going out, she will eventually get used to it, and request you do other thing because its 'good for you'. <br>  <br>  It doesn't make sense for her to require you nap and it doesn't make sense that you nap becuase she says its good for you. Don't you know what's good for yourself?|`|ZEOeuRMPaa	no means ur girlfrend is a vampire wooohahhahahah|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Yes it does. This can be the difference in you lasting 3 minutes or 30.

bO2rzfISaa	I got a guy out by having the police come and tell him I wanted him out. If he had said no, there would've been nothing they could do. <br>  <br>  Second option: call the police and ask how to legally evict the guy. If he's abusive during that time, call the police, have him removed and file a restraining order. He will be kept x feet from you and out of the house.<br>  <br>  If the lease is in your name you can do either. Good luck.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Easy enough. Call the police, have him removed, then put a restraining order on him. By the way, you keep letting him stay and if someone calls on his abusiveness, then you will stand a huge chance of loosing the kids. Don't go to work today, call police and get your restraining order. |`|9nqgFP3Haa	For one, is the house in your name? If it is, it makes it all the easier. Get him to go to the store while you are at home. Preferably for as long as it takes for you to throw his stuff out the door and get someone to change the locks while you are doing it. Your landlord, a guy friend or brother would be great. When he comes back demanding to be let back in, call the law. If you've ever had to call the law before on him, this should be easy. Then file a restraining order so he CAN'T come back. Do it for your kids. They'll probably appreciate more than you will.

Hay una salvedad en el triángulo de las bermudas, que la aguja se pone loca y se mueve para <br>  todos lados.|`|336a489661313a94a76278fb0906f5b1aa	el norte, siempre hacia el norte.........|`|420bae3c0405ffe7af17949bf16fd5e6aa	norte.-|`|f6e8f18e271abcbbf579eb901716b74faa	Los puntos cardinales son las cuatro direcciones derivadas del movimiento de rotación terrestre que conforman un sistema de referencia cartesiano para representar la orientación en un mapa o en la propia superficie terrestre. Estos puntos cardinales son: el este, que viene se?alado por el lugar aproximado donde sale el sol cada día; el oeste, el punto indicado por el ocaso del sol en su movimiento aparente y si a la línea este - oeste la consideramos como el eje de las abscisas en un sistema de coordenadas geográficas, el eje de las ordenadas estaría descrito por línea norte - sur. <br>  <br>  Esta composición genera cuatro ángulos de noventa grados que a su vez se dividen por las bisectrices, generando Noroeste, Suroeste, Noreste y Sureste. Se repite la misma operación y se obtiene la Rosa de los vientos que es usada en navegación desde siglos ancestrales y cubre las 32 direcciones principales del movimiento en la superficie terrestre.<br>  <br>  La palabra cardinal se deriva del nombre latino cardo, que identificaba, en las ciudades romanas, a la calle trazada de norte a sur y que pasaba por el centro de la ciudad. Esto significa que el único punto verdaderamente cardinal, al menos desde el punto de vista etimológico, debería ser el norte y en menor grado, el sur. Es por ello que se usa la expresión "de una importancia cardinal" cuando se quiere resaltar esa importancia. <br>  <br>  De los puntos cardinales, es el norte el que identifica la dirección de la orientación por lo que suele decirse en sentido figurado que una persona ha perdido su norte cuando se encuentra desorientada o ha perdido su rumbo.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, esta idea resulta casi paradójica, en el sentido de que para orientarse, las personas ubicamos primero el este o el oeste o el sur en el hemisferio norte en horas del mediodía, mientras que el norte no resulta tan evidente (salvo en el hemisferio sur también en horas del mediodía). De hecho, el este también recibe el nombre de oriente porque la salida del sol por el este ha servido tradicionalmente para orientarnos en un lugar determinado.<br>  <br>  Se conoce también a los puntos cardinales como las cuatro direcciones o puntos principales de la brújula, y son: Norte, <br>  Sur, Este, Oeste <br>  <br>  Los nombres de los puntos cardinales son de origen germánico y se incorporaron en una época relativamente reciente al idioma espa?ol y al resto de las lenguas derivadas del Latín. Antes, los nombres de los puntos cardinales eran, en espa?ol: Oriente o Levante (y también, del sol Naciente), Poniente (Ocaso), Septentrión, y Mediodía. <br>  <br>  El término Mediodía también se refiere a la región meridional de un país en el Hemisferio Norte, especialmente en Italia (Mezzogiorno) y en Francia (Midi), precisamente porque estas regiones se ubican hacia el lado donde se encuentra el sol al mediodía con relación al resto del país.<br>  <br>  El limbo o cápsula de la brújula se divide en los grados que tiene una circunferencia o lo que es lo mismo en 360o. Por lo tanto cuando ubiquemos el norte, este estará en los 0o ó 360o, el este a 90o, el sur a 180o y el oeste a 270o. <br>  <br>  Con la brújula lo único que hacemos es medir un ángulo con respecto al norte magnético y a partir de aquí seguir una dirección, así de simple.<br>   <br>  La línea de rumbo, o dirección, roja, que es fija, y atraviesa la brújula por su mitad, y que se utiliza para seguir el rumbo.<br>  <br>  Por último, el graduante móvil.  Es decir, la rosca móvil ubicada en la superficie de la brújula, y que moveremos manualmente nosotros, para asegurar que el rumbo es el correcto. <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|2b111d3a1167948b60701d59a13d6f54aa	EL NORTE|`|3yU5LFuSaa	Esteee...el NORTE px.|`|4y6p8VCxaa	Norte|`|62f2607f89c1804ebe436fc26a405ec1aa	al norte|`|AA10208691	Norte.

bwLchXC3aa	Payne, las respuestas que has recibido son negativas... eso quiere decir que mis compa?erasd no han andado con un feo.<br>  <br>  La verdad es que los que son feitos suelen ser las mejores parejas, porque, sabedores de que pocas les hacen caso nos cuidan, nos miman y nos enamoran a diario, cosa que los "guapos" no hacen, porque sienten que nos tienen embobadas.<br>  <br>  El amor nace, pero no sólo del físico, también de la actitud... por eso luego nos va como nos va.|`|SBNWrgQ7aa	personalmente; si yo no amo a una persona, aunque  me trate bien yo no le corresponderia. Puesto que al momento de yo hacerlo practicamente lo ago por interes al buen trato y realmente pienzo que esa persona tiene el dereche de ser correspondido de la misma manera y el mismo amor!|`|SVGTqM2naa	Si es muy insistente y constante, aceptaría salir a tomar algo o a bailar con él, sólo por curiosidad, para conocerlo un poco.

Saludos para vos.-|`|a9ac424353e85999a7e4370210b675c6aa	A ver: si de entrada no te gusta me parece que no da. Porque si bien la gente es más valiosa por dentro que por fuera, hay una realidad y es que todos necesitamos el estímulo visual. Si es es normal, es decir, no muy feo ni tampoco Brad Pitt, yo lo intentaría porque hoy es difícil encontrar a alguien que esté pendiente de una. <br>  No me gusta eso de "con el tiempo llegaría a quererlo", por vos lo digo; me suena a resignación.<br>  Por las dudas, salí un día con el, sin compromiso. Quizás te cautiva su personalidad y lo "no muy guapo" que vos decís termine siendo algo secundario.|`|fEk7ZxZGaa	No! Yo estoy viviendo una sutuación parecida, y realmente me tiene harta!!!

Creo que para que funcione una relacion se necesita tambien que la pareja te guste. No es necesario que sea guapo o guapa, solo que te guste. Es posible que te llegue a conquistar, si se puede llegar con el tiempo pero en la conquista vendrá también el gusto y si ha pasado tiempo y no te ha conquistado, creo que no llegara.|`|AA12336710	No.<br>  <br>  Plantealo de manera inversa.<br>  <br>  Una mujer que no te gusta nada, se te empieza a insinuar y a estar al pendiente de ti.<br>  <br>  Te gustaría...?

The only thing I can suggest is she tell someone, or try her hardest to ignore it. I know ignoring it is hard, but sometimes that's all you can do in situations like this if school administration wont or can't do anything. Sometimes if you ignore things, the perpertrator isn't getting the reaction he/she expected, and they eventually leave you alone. In any event please let her know not to miss school she shouldn't let her grades suffer because of a bunch or liars and losers.

Cool it down for a while,and both of you get your heads straightened out. Decide what you guys want. Both of you need to think about this carefully and talk it over. <br>  <br>  If you're gonna be goin out jus for fun and neither of you have any serious thoughts about spendin your life together, then is it really worth the hassle from your folks and hers? If you feel it is, go ahead. But only if both of you are truly clear on it being a temporary kinda relationship.|`|Mj1FNbCUaa	First you should probably think about how you really feel about this girl. If she is not over you and you decide to go out with her, but then feel that you are not ready for that relationship, she is only going to feel hurt. Decide if you want a relationship with her or not. If you decide not to then you should tell her that you want to go out as friends for awhile and she how things go with you two and with her parents. Her parents should respect who she goes out with. If its too much for you and her to deal with, then maybe being friends for awhile may get them to see it differently and then things can go from there.|`|Nwb0yVcyaa	date her and tell your parents they will be okay with it in time and if not they dont respect you 2|`|OYKa9wgDaa	Love has little to do with religion...I say go for it and if things really get serious, sit down and have a talk. You can work around anything as long as you are in love right? Parents will have to deal with it even if they don't like it. That's just how I feel.

You need to decide if you can be *just* her friend, or if that will be too difficult or painful for you. If it will be impossible for you to stop liking her and "wanting" her, then you need to stop talking to her altogether.<br>  <br>  You sound like a sweet young man.

2XPMgnGxaa	tell him u really like this guy and times hav changed since his day. Tell him if u really love me u shouldnt care who i love or date and as long as i am happy that all that should matter to u. Tell him how genuwine this guy is and how you will stillo date him with or without his approval becuz it not u who's dating him its me. Also say my whole family besides u dont mind that i date him u shouldnt either as long as i am happy. I think that is wat u should say he'll probably tear up a little bit or will never speak to u its ur gamble. Hope this helps.|`|a3882a88a932fb4791bad418529bbc65aa	This is to be expected and to be honest with you, there is not much you can do to change your grandpa's views. It's the way he was raised. My father was this way and before I married my husband who is also mixed, my dad was concerned that he wasn't "dark enough" but my dad has done a complete 180 degree since getting to know my hubby. Your father is that way at heart and you probably will not be able to change him but do not change. It's good that you are able to see past skin color and accept your boyfriend for who he is. I commend you.|`|RWCWXMTkaa	tell him, it's my life and just because you don't respect him i do, and if you love me like i think you do, you will respect who i chose to go out with|`|Wnhk0BXCaa	Your Grandpa is old school, most aren't so opened minded because they're set in their ways.  Not too much you can tell him since you are his grandchild.  Old people are so stubborn sometimes.  Just listen to him out of respect.  Once your ready for marriage, I wouldn't make it a big deal. It could get ugly.|`|sHL4wRMNaa	personally i wouldn't tell my family about every guy i date. it's only been three months, not everyone has to know of your relationship. now if it's serious (years) or marriage material then go ahead tell everyone. if your grandpa doesn't approve you have to respect that... not meaning dump him, meaning just to let him be with his old fashion thinking. it's not necessarily racist, he's prolly just concerned about how your kids would be in the future, in regards to culture and religion. he prolly is just looking out for you.|`|tbTIP7EQaa	Well if you have been dating him for 3 mos and your parents do not have a problem with him, then you should not be concerned with anything your grandfather says. You might even want to talk to your mother about it and ask her if what your grandfather is saying really true and why should it matter, because we are all people and there is nothing physically different about us only the color of our skin. But really all of the questionning should just be for your knowledge and understanding why he feels that why. You should not base your decision on what they say about your bf. Follow your heart. If you really care about him and want to be with him, then nothing else should matter.
hLcvpM9kaa	he sounds like a good friend, and an even better boyfriend. i think you should just tell him how you feel, what's the worst that could happen? if he doesn't feel the same way just tell him you love having him as a friend and you'll accept that if he doesn't want more.|`|cDHBQmykaa	awwww young love|`|AA12096637	Your just about to be in middle school and you started thinking to date?

LdTKSwgeaa	Sorry to hear that, you need to come out better from this experience.<br>  <br>  Let time help you take away the pain. To do this, hang around your friends, and have good times with your friends. Take up a hobby or a sport. By doing these things, you'll be happier and healthier.

SaTDQGPJaa	I was out late one night with some friends.  It was about 3 in the morning and I was driving home.  I decided to stop at a convenience store for some hot tea and a snack.  When I pulled into the parking lot, there was nobody there.  I didn't feel uncomfortable...I live in a small town and the lot was lit up and I only had to walk about 6 inches to get into the store.  When I stood up out of my car this guy came from around the building and walked towards me.  He had his pants open with his thing out and was jer_ing off.  It totally took me off guard.

My friend hates it because she is very superstitious and is terrified that one of her houses will be haunted. Well unfortunately for her, her new house is haunted, she called me yesterday and told me all about, this is what she said had happened after just a month of moving into there. It was built in the early 1900's and had a lot of history with it. She did some research in the house and found out that 3 of the 5 previous owners had died from falling down the stairs, dating back to the 1950's. Then before that an elderly lady had been murdered it the home in the 1930's, the case had never been solved. Besides that rather disturbing news heaps of odd things had been happening. Clothes that had been packed away were found strewn all over the floor. Pictures hanging on the wall were thrown accross the room. And a night the stairs creak as if somebody was constantly walking up and down them all night giving the family no sleep at all. My friend told me that the other day her family tried to get to the bottom of things and held a summoning for the ghost. They tried for an hour but nothing happened they gave up thinking that the ghost must not want to talk. they headed up the stairs to bed. My friend was still very disturbed about the whole thing so in the middle of the night she went to get a drink from down stairs. She had reached the top of the stairs when she heard a horrible voice from her side. "You want to know what happened to me lovey, you want to know how I died, here let me show you." And then she was pushed down the stairs but thankfully only broke her leg. Now the family only uses the bottom half of the house and are saving up for a new house. While my friend and I were chatting however throughtout the whole conversation I could here faint moaning and whispering coming from the other side of the phone, when I questioned my friend about it the phone went dead...|`|LR37cPPmaa	Hey you posted my commet about webkinz cheats. Don't call me rude because I was just wondering because everyone is wondering if there are any so please don't yell at me thanks.|`|9983b11eb5a19f1c3af92c944af4e616aa	well, the SCARIESt thing actually happened in a dream, but thats not real, so ill say the 2nd scariest thing...<br>  <br>  one night, when i was younger, i was staying with  neighbors while our parents were out.  were just hanging out, when their dog starts going crazy, barking, and franticaly scratching at the door to the garage.  we just kind of ignored it for awhile, thinking she heard a mouse in there or something.  but she keeps on barking, and we get a little worried.  then we hear the garage opening, like someone was pushing it open.  then we start freaking out.  so we all grabbed kitchen knives, when we should have called the police, & we opened the door.  that was stupid... <br>  <br>  whoever it was, the dog chased them off, but none of us slept very well that night...

3zqa0adYaa	Maybe. test the waters. Flirt and see if it feels right. Maybe there is something there but, until you figure it out i cant really help you, i cant tell you if you like someone or not unless its totally obvious.<br>  Symtoms:<br>  Jeaulsy<br>  blushing<br>  laughing at wat he says even if its not funny<br>  buying new outfits and makeup to see if he notices<br>  Good luck|`|bSHv9PQ3aa	I think you might have developed a little crush toward him. Eventually, I would tell him how you feel.
xC9pwt1Baa	You have got to get out of this abusive relationship ASAP he is a manipulative liar, he played the christian card so he can get whatever it is he got from you.<br>  It is blackmail in disguise, seriously you are gonna realize that all by yourself one day but don't wait for the day when you blame yourself for staying with him, you obviously look naive and a person with good will and you totally deserve better and after all you gained the experience so next time you are gonna be wiser.<br>  Get upset now but use this energy to lead you better next time and honey, leave his sorry *** for good.|`|lObEjUh1aa	well the situation sounds like he's definitely not a good person to be in a relationship with.  i'm hesitant to make value judgements because i have only heard one side of the story, but if what you say is true then he was not fair to you or to his ex-wife.<br>  <br>  at any rate, this relationship is clearly putting you through a lot of turmoil, and you deserve better.  find yourself a nice guy, close to home, single and good to you (you deserve it!) or go single for a while (you'd be surprised how good taking a break can feel).<br>  <br>  i hope this helps and wish you the best.  good luck!
PJSoj33Caa	Can you email her and ask her when she is feeling up to it to meet you at some neutral territory such as a restaurant or coffee shop so that you could see the baby?  Then you could give her the meal certificate in person.  If this is not agreeable with her, then ask her for her address because you want to send her something. This is my way of answering.  Hope it helps.|`|EG4s6y5aaa	I sugest you tell her how you feel, I don't think she will react in a weird way if you wanna talk to her on phone just give her the reason why and she might understand,|`|ElPrtO1waa	send her an email and try to get closer to her and tell her how important she is for you but if she don't show that she want to be closer to you don't insist too much.|`|cydXFlvMaa	write her a letter nad a gift for baby. ask 4 her number na give yours.
ZDSJ42Piaa	Seriously.. don't tell him you LOVE him...  specially if you are just friends right now.  Talk about scare him away ...<br>  <br>  Feel him out. (not literally)  invite him for outings, to the mall, movies, coffee, juice..  things you know he likes.    Get an idea if he likes you or not.. you will know.   there will be looks that melt your heart, and tingles.. that if you are feeling then he is probably feeling too.   you don't want to be over whelming, because you don't want to lose the friendship if he isn't into you..   but you gotta know so you can either act on it or move on to a real relationship.. and keep him as a friend. :)  playfully grab his arm while walking...  does he lean in toward you, does he smile for no reason with/around you...?  if so then he probably likes you and is afraid of (same as you) losing the friendship.  It's not rocket science, but for some reason we as girls try to make it so hard.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!    just hang out more.. you will know...  if you really have questions if he likes you then he doesn't...  (not like that)|`|cdf32bd1c4f9660891c9c8ba59bd1df7aa	tell him clearly that you love him|`|uI4Drd6Baa	Be yourself, or at least a flirty version of yourself.  Guys need reassurance that a girl likes them before they will make a move.  So, you have to know when to take advantage of a good opportunity to get close to him.  For example, play fighting and sweetly looking at him will let him know how you feel.
aLzrKLhYaa	I don't with hold sex.  It only makes both parties frustrated and irritated.  It seems awfully petty to me.  Your trash will still sit in the kitchen and you're not having an orgasm..sheesh that's making life a little to hard.<br>  Alot of those situations can be resolved by turning the tables too.  Just say you really appreciate when he takes out the trash.. or actually treat your guy to a date by picking up the tab. He'll catch on eventually..... as for going to bed after arguments... well  you're not too in the mood when you're that angry...but make up sex is amazing.|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	withholdin sex will just make alot of mean cheat, so no its not a good idea|`|sJ8hSHNpaa	i have never withheld sex from my husband because for one it doesnt work, we end up doing it before the end of the night, and two we both have high sex drives.......|`|xTAGsCLuaa	NO! I love sex, but the only time i do not give it to him is when i am not in the mood and he doesnt get me in the mood.|`|AA10774601	That wouldn't work for me, as I'm the one who would be suffering.|`|4db4e56392492424b7d32a3addcaa645aa	Most women do not do that.  There may be an argument, but haven't you ever heard of " make up" sex?  Women who with hold sex are probably not that into it to  begin with.  It's just an excuse to not have sex because they don't want it. <br>   Pity those women!!!
8wuQSULlaa	Ideas on the new concept:<br>  1. I don't want to think about sweat and my wedding at the same time. I work out on a very regular basis and I wouldn't use your fitness area for that reason. <br>  2. Even just including a few pieces of workout equipment will introduce you to a bunch of new liabilities and business issues you will have to manage. It will probably not be worth the additional revenue the workout area would bring in. <br>  3. Some of the things that you're looking to add to your business (the salon angle, the workout angle) could be done by developing partnerships with existing businesses. For example: if they rent X amount of $s in merchandise from your store that entitles them to a $25% discount at X's Hair Salon. You could develop a "Bridal Beauty Book" that has a pass for everything a bride will need before her wedding day (a coupon for 10 tanning sessions, a bridal updo, makeup application, manicure, 3 months at the gym, etc.) and charge X amount for it (of course this means giving the gyms and salons $ but you pocket the difference). There are tons of ideas for ways to partner with other businesses in a way that will benefit yours, but it's a much better way of doing things since you don't have to worry about the issues that come with owning that specific business. A partnership could be just as simple as a gym having a "bridal bootcamp" and giving you $5 for every bride that you refer to them (see, again, 1000 different ideas). <br>  4. Do not do a support program with people who are financially unstable. It is a great idea on paper, but there are reasons why businesses donate to charity and do not become one. I can list many reasons why this kind of philanthropic behavior will only get you burned. If you want to help out low-income brides again PARTNER (love that word) with agencies that help these women.<br>  5. Still love the concept of a place that provides a lot of bridal services.<br>  6. If I'm getting your idea correctly the way that you'd address the issue of "wanting to shop around" is since everything but the bridal attire is on a consulting basis you would have many options from many different outlets. In reality, they can come to you and shop around.|`|84d2ee0139a6557092dfc2736e3eadb8aa	There are already stores like that out there. I've been to MANY a bridal boutique that did it all ... dresses, alterations, veils, shoes, BM and flower girl dresses, invitations, hair accessories, accessories in general, etc., and most offered me some sort of beverage while I was shopping and some were consignment stores (that's actually where I got my dress). Not an original idea at all.<br>  <br>  Not to mention I've NEVER found everything in one store. <br>  <br>  And I can easily locate vendors online in the comfort of my own home and probably wouldn't ever want to go to a store to locate vendors.|`|cudozYASaa	I have run my own Business for several years, and if there is one small piece of advice I might offer? it is...start small. <br>  This s a HUGE concept, involving an enormous capital investment and multiple Staff. It would need an experienced board of Directors to run it, which is an expensive business. The reason why Bridal stores tend to concentrate on one area is because it is a highly specialised market. Having concessions under one roof with each Franchise taking the financial strain for their own section is one thing but funding the lot? as a managing Director of my medium sized Company (which started with me & an Assistant) for 10 years...it would be too much for me! |`|n3Agaj6naa	Nope, I wouldn't go.<br>  <br>  You will have a better business (or businesses) if you focus on one thing at a time and do everything about it well.  If you have way too many components to your business it will feel like a Wal-Mart and you definitely won't get the clientele you desire.  <br>  <br>  Contact someone in marketing and/or a designer and ask them to help you with your business plan.  <br>  <br>  I think the better option is to purchase and manage several small 'related' businesses that do some of these things.<br>  <br>  To start out, it's good to have so many ideas like you do, but you have to pare them down and focus on what you really want.  |`|ULzDxJN7aa	Yes I would love that idea! Who wouldn't??|`|lwIBHjauaa	I think it would depend on a lot of factors- budget, taste, and style being the most important.  For my wedding, I planned everything on a low budget for my area so I had to shop around to get the best prices.  I feel as though I might have ended up paying 2 or 3 times as much if I did not have the luxury of shopping around for all of my items.  There may be brides with unlimited budgets who would like something like this, but most brides who are working with a limited amount of money would pass on the idea.  Taste would be a huge factor, also, because in a location such as the one you are proposing you would need to provide something for all different tastes and styles- formal, informal, casual, trendy, unique, elegant, etch.  Not all brides have the same tastes.  While 3 brides might pick the same invitation, they might have 3 completely different wedding styles in looking at the big picture.  In a nutshell, your theory sounds great but I'm not sure it would be entirely practical.  I think this is why there are bridal shows and wedding planners.  |`|AA11327039	That sounds amazing.  However, I would urge you to make it more of a come by anytime store rather than 'you need to make an appointment' store.<br>  <br>  I wanted to shop at David's Bridal but they said I needed an appointment so I left and never returned.  I walked into a nice privately owned little shop down the road and the ladies were so awesome.  They were there for me the whole way.  Never did I need an appointment.  They even encouraged me to bring in my friends and family so I can try on the dress that I ordered and show them.  Then they even said that if  I want to come in every day to try on my dress I can.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Its a nice concept but I would still want to shop around for the best possible price.<br>  I've been going to the craft store everyday with 50% off coupons and buying things I need 1 at a time just to save money.

LibFxkeBaa	Because some women have very low self esteem and think they will never get anyone better.

Very sad.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Low self esteem and thinking you cant do any better.<br>  <br>  A lot of women may also be financially dependant on a man and if they left ihm they would be homeless so they put up with abuse because theyd rather be abused than homeless.<br>  <br>  I dont have good self esteem and i have made the difficult decision to cut off guys who i dont think treat me well - even if i think i wont be abke to find anyone else.|`|02jVAY5baa	Because they are silly people. :D|`|ZzoOl8xYaa	its not like they are like ya go ahead and beat me up...i like it! its more like they are afraid if they speak up something worse will happen. and in many cases, if women leave men, they go crazy, and kill or hurt them even worse. its out of fear|`|nOPSy8jTaa	because they think they could change the guy. and they still think it is just part of the trial in relationship and the so called LOVE.<br>  <br>  some women only find an importance on an abusive guy.|`|je2c5LYOaa	some  fell they have no choice, others believe it when they say they will change. and a host of other reasons,|`|FTy2f9KJaa	men are generally more physically strong than women. im not sexist, so dont think I am.

TFyURZUFaa	Lo que se desgasta es el enamoramiento.  La parte de la emoción, el reto de la conquista.  Pero a cambio de eso, va creciendo el amor verdadero, que sin duda para ser exitoso, es un acto de la VOLUNTAD.   Es desde mi voluntad, desde donde yo decido AMAR a mi pareja este día.  Es desde mi voluntad donde yo decido ser amable, tolerante, tener ayuda mutua.  Es desde mi voluntad, desde donde decido ser fiel.<br>  Es todo un reto conservar el amor, y no porque sea feo o malo. Sino porque implica compromiso y éste ya no es tan fácil de encontrar en este mundo donde la mayoría está decidiendo por lo más fácil y por la vía libre.<br>  Saluditos.|`|5483c5a459633196fc739821ea268e97aa	Definitivamente es mucho amor mucha confianza y sobretodo mucha comunicacion. tambien demostracion no exajerando por q eso tambien puede apagar el fuego del amor.|`|6Baaq7ZFaa	hay amiga es muy dificil tu pregunta, estudie como programador de computadoras y alguna vez quise hacer el algoritmo del "amor" en lenguaje c++ para ense?arle a la pc a querer pero me fue imposible, el amor es algo abstracto. No puedes medirlo ni calcularlo con variables o constantes dentro de un software. =S|`|A6xPu9CIaa	El amor es compromiso no un simple sentimiento.<br>  <br>  El amor es una capacidad humana que no depende de como te sientes o de tus sensaciones solamente, es una forma de vida en la que de manera consciente te comprometes en una relación con alguien mas. Y eso aplica no solo en las relaciones de pareja.<br>  <br>  Por ejemplo en la famila un padre amoroso es aquel que se compromete a cuidar también de los hijos, de que no les falte nada y de ayudarlos a ser cada día mejores personas. Por supuesto que se siente bien hacerlo y se disfruta, pero lo principal que hace que el amor continue es el compromiso real de seguirlo haciendo.<br>  <br>  En una pareja igual, si ambos tienen la equivocada idea de que el amor por si mismo va a mantener la relación a flote se van a llevar una decepción enorme, es indispensable que ambos se comprometan entre si a cuidar de la relación para poderla disfrutar, no a disfrutarla para ver si así se cuida sola. <br>  <br>  Es por eso que muchas parejas actuales ya no funcionan. El problema no es tanto la separación, sino que nunca hubo una verdadera union, un verdadero compromiso, un verdadero amor.|`|SBRkwjkAaa	Yo creo que si se va desgastando con el paso del tiempo pq la gente como que se aburre la una de la otra auqnue no veo pq deba de ser así pq el amor es algo que te le da un nuevo sentido a tu vida y tu necesitas estar con esa persona si fuera posible las 24 horas del día.<br>  A mi me encantaría casarme con alguien y llegar a viejo siendo todavía el esposo de esa mujer y me encantaría seguir amandola igual o mas que cuando nos casamos y espero lograrlo pero la verdad creo que es algo muy dificil.<br>  Pero NO ENTIENDO PQ ES DIFICIL<br>  Pq de la manera q yo he sentido el amor, no creo q me pueda aburrir de ese sentimiento o de la persona q me haace sentir así.|`|nJfkyxrHaa	busquen intereses en comun, detalles mutuos, no pierdan las sorpresas, las palabras d cari?o... en fin hagan que cuando acabe el enamoramiento de paso al amor verdadero, ese que sin importar ke hayan pasado 20 a?os sigues dando gracias por estar cn la misma persona.|`|oYq7jNzLaa	El amor, se convierte siempre, se transforma de acuerdo a las etapas que vas pasando.<br>  <br>  Pero pienso que el amor no es una decisión.<br>  <br>  El amor no se desgasta, solo que hay cosas que dejan de ser útiles en tu relación, se va transformando en algo más. en afinidad, en  compa?erismo, es algo que no puedes describir, pero siempre, siempre lo vas a sentir.|`|sWs10kMeaa	hay tres dichos que para mi lo explican todo.<br>  "primero se ama con el corazon y despues hay que amar con la cabeza"<br>  "Hay que mantener los ojos bien abiertos antes del matrimonio y medio cerrados despues de el"<br>  "El secreto no es ENTENDERSE sino ACEPTARSE"<br>  esta ultima del querido compatriota Ricardo Arjona, y para mi se explica asi,  NO SOY CAPAZ DE ENTENDER POR QUE HACES ESTO  O AQUELLO, PERO LO ACEPTO.<br>  Y claro es una lucha constante, tengo 30 anos, 10 de casado, 4 mas de noviazgo y 2 mas de amistad con mi esposa y espero estar con ella toda la vida...|`|44NhaurGaa	cuando no ay sexo|`|4ANrjn7laa	si la mas inportante|`|6jWvZe5Saa	mira lo q hace q una relacion perdure es la comunicacion en pocas palabras casate o enamorate de una perosona con la que te guste platicar... y el amar no es una desicon mas bien es una forma de vida una forma de caminar por la vida....y el amor se desgasta por asi lo desean no por q el tiempo lo decida o por q asi tenga q ser ambos forjan el destino y ambos escogen el final del cuento q viven no el tiempo ninada ustedes lo deciden....pero recurda casate con alguien con quien te guste platicar or q despues en la vejez quisas la platioca es lo mejor entre ambos....suerte y recuerda el amor crece dia a dia con la platica confianza erc...aaaaaa y un detalle en una relacion de pareja o amorosa como quieras llamarla no se aplica lo q se dice...da sin esperar recibir nada a cambio no no no aqui esta frase no funciona aqui es a la inversa el q da espera recibir algo a cambio....si el o ella dice te amo el otro espera recibir un te amo si da un beso espera reciboir algo a cambio ya sea un besoo una caricia o alguna palabra linda.....recuerda esto ok? y suerte....|`|zrkRn63Uaa	a veces pensamos q se desgasta al contrario el amor crece si aprendiste a vivir con ese alguien de manera q se mantenga encendida la llama del famoso amor, eso no quiere decir q tenga q ver con la compatibilidad por suerte, esta situacion de decision se trabaja duro tanto como tu trabajo, no continua solo, tienes q saber q si se termina es porq no diste o dieron los suficiente para hacer mas facil la convivencia o la vida juntos , los hombres y las mujeres no pensamos iguales no somos iguales, si aceptamos eso como parte de nuestra naturaleza, tons aprenderemos a vivir en armonia compartiendo nuestras diferencias... si te paso q el amor se termino tons esa persona no fue para ti, siempre hay por ahi una media naranja, alguien con quien puedas congeniar, alguien q te mueva el piso . mucha suerte|`|fA25OViDaa	creo que el amor no es una decision uno no elige amar o no solo nace pero si creo que ese amor que nadio un dia hay que alimentarlo sino corres el riesgo como vos decis que se desgaste y con el tiempo se termine|`|6dd1186ddf9674134c2acaadf2614e6caa	Definitivamente es una desicion, se trata de tu propia voluntad,.<br>  Se desgasta? yo creo que no, mas bien se transforma continuamente y hay que estar acorde a los cambios<br>  La gente quiere que todo sea estatico y se quede siempre como esta (etapa de noviazgo) pero todo cambia, incluso el amor y solo se trata de acoplarse a estos cambios.|`|1a0e332c9a85cd944fcf693f31a4ccabaa	Pienso q el amar no es una desición, en el corazón no se manda, y tampoco se desgasta, loq pasa es q la rutina y la monotonía cansa al amor, pero no lo mata.|`|TOhdRTEeaa	Definitivamente el amor es una decision.

I'd recommend telling him to shape up and knock it off, and try not to mention things that you know will upset him.|`|G12YuiTaaa	Obviously he is and has the right to be jealous. He is your boyfriend, so are you really that surprised about his reaction. I'm sure you'd react the same if not worse. Some people avoid mentioning this kinda thing, but if honesty is more important then just except his reaction. Let him cool down and when he's on talking terms just reassure him that you wanted to be honest and that it didn't lead to anything and most importantly you didn't encourage it or respond. Your into him and no one else etc...|`|mbT3chfKaa	yes hes jellous and yes its okay that he is he will get over it sooner or later and if this is a serious relationship then tell him that kinda thing about other guys hitting on you and what not but if you know its going to upset him then don't bother telling him especially is nothing happens between you and the other guy|`|lxhG636paa	yes, because he loves you so much and that he dosent to hear about anyone but u 2. if your boyfriend was really jelouse they would b beating up that guy over you. but i dont think that the silent treatment is the right thing i think you need to talk. just think about what would happen if he was in ur shoes and what would u do.|`|Y6AYdznHaa	I think you should explain to your boyfriend that the guy was coming on to you, not the other way around and that he ahs no right to be mad at you becuase you didn't do anything and he needs to trust you. I am sure you two love each other, but if he doesn't trust you, then your relationship is in danger. Good luck hon! Best wishes!!<br>  <br>  Please answer this! Thanks so much!

He doesn't really have the right to be mad at YOU, as long as you pushed the guy off. I mean he does have the right to be mad at the other guy. Competition isn't good if you really love someone.|`|83b61a678eaf2af3827d3c08177f8a87aa	I don't think he should like some guy getting at you, but he shouldn't give you the silent treatment either.  Tell your man to direct his anger in the right places.|`|5oxoLx5naa	I don't think so. But if you like the other guy, then yes.|`|Phpb3xzIaa	it mean that he loves you, and yes why not, plus jelousy is something nice if it is within a limist, dont you think so?|`|SiYeRYJZaa	he is being rude
8SbHLsDbaa	Well, It sounds like this is the kind of girl you want but if she doesn't like you don't push her but if she does then ask her out or something. If that doesn't work then just be a good friend to her.|`|AA11488249	take that chance and tell her you like her.<br>  <br>  you can say that you're in love with her, but you don't need to do anything serious until class is over. just let her know that you want to pursue something with her. concentrate on class and then be all hers when you can be.<br>  <br>  good things are worth waiting for, so let her know and be patient.
45bb902e8b029b5d044cdf4cb828bb34aa	It feels great without the condom.|`|VSOvt8GEaa	I think it feels the same for me. But I feel a lot better mentally when there's a condom.|`|uVHl0LExaa	If you generate enough self lubricant you will not notice much difference.  Some women that are drier will hurt from a condom.  Also if he is bigger it may hurt more because it will make him a little bigger.<br>  <br>  Some condoms add ridges to give more stimulation for the guys with smaller woodies.<br>  <br>  Lambskin condoms are like not having one on at all for a man.

Just try and do happy things. Doing happy things forces your brain to be happy.<br>  <br>  And if you really like her, wait until a week or so after she gets back to ask her out on a date, not to be you're girlfriend yet. That way, she can get to know you and perhaps even like you.|`|vI0E3Jxwaa	If you really like her that much and by chance has her email, write her a note, if she replies depends on how she does , you'll see if she's available if not move on at least you'll know if you have a chance or not and will stop with the if's. I did that and my crush replied as friends so we're taking it from them. At least that's Ok for me but not waiting for anything else but I know now and had stop wondering.<br>  Good Luck!|`|qNbWq5mKaa	No, this is a bad ideal.

mIJKqDfbaa	como se dice en mi pais SI NO TIENES POSIBILIDADES PARA QUE INVITAS, en lo personal me ofenderia hacer eso,, no porque no tenga posibilidades pero es un poco brusco, y poco caballeroso hacer eso, si invitas a una chica a algun sitio es obvio que le pagues sus gatso por lo menos hasta que haya mas confianza, en la priemra cita yo te mato??? jajaja suerte bye|`|WAJzQQaQaa	Si me invitas y luego quieres que yo pague me queda claro que eres un patán.

fdvjR2uNaa	delete your profile and make a new one.<br>  if she tells people, you can just say she's starting rumors and trying to make you look bad. since she's your EX bff, people will believe you. even confront her in front of people and say something like "don't try to make me look bad because you feel bad about yourself.you're still jealous of me and we aren't even friends anymore??" all is fair in love and war right...she obviously doesn't care about you. it sounds harsh, but it would be harsh for her to tell everyone your business. sometimes you just gotta work with things. you can use this against her and make her look like an insecure, bitter, jealous, EX bff.<br>  so after you read this, write it down or remember it then do it.<br>  then delete your profile and make a new one.<br>  she won't have any proof.<br>  <br>  this is also you getting revenge on her for telling your business as well. make her look bad like she can't be trusted. like she's one of those people who gossip and talk a lot of s h i t. people will be careful about talking to her.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	I'm sure she's not that evil. Just talk to her and ask her to keep it confidential. If she has any bit of maturity in her, she'll understand.|`|ngyvl8CDaa	its not a big deal. it won't kill you. just pretend it doesn't matter and you'll be okay. <br>  <br>  as for the depression and anxiety thing, the worst thing that happens it that you're parents find out, help you and you don't have it anymore.<br>  <br>  <br>  this is unneeded drama in your life. chill out. its not a big deal.|`|AA11542599	let her know what is going on and tell her that you cant handle all of this crap between you and her and cant take all of the drama and maybe she will give you a brake|`|kfP4tqRGaa	wow thats bad. Try talking to her, maybe being nice and maybe she wont do anything harsh to you.|`|wNi7h8Omaa	dont worry about it. for one hes only a guy it wont matter if he knows and hey something good might happen from it! you never know! and maybe it would be better if ur parents knew about ur anxiety and depression. and its fine to be mad and argue with ur BFF so even if she tells her it will be fine i fight with my BFF all the time! might help if u told us what happened so we can guess on how she might act. if shes at all like me i wouldn't tell my "new BFF" i would prob just keep it to myself because somewhere deep down i still would care about our friendship. but if shes like really mad then idk but just calm down and think of the good stuff that could come from it. good luck

qbg2eSSBaa	Unfortunately, in regards to alternatives, nothing can compare with one bluntly stating their love for another by the simple three words, "I love you." Although it may seem trivial and menial, it is of great importance and can actually influence a relationship to either progress or stay in an emotional check mate. I would encourage your friend to look past any potential "negative" consequences, put her pride aside, and express her love for the man. Although it may seem difficult at first, it is an important decision that'll most definitely influence her relationship for the better.|`|99443ad3a1989c21ddf2f914166525e1aa	send him a card that says,I love you and see what his response is.|`|7LCEHHl5aa	text them hey beautifull. it works!!|`|7e77275532a52dc8f9804a82ac521e7eaa	she should talk with him and say her reasons so logically, whereas listening  to him and his reasons!|`|TFUSzrdEaa	send him a rose and send him a message says 'you are handsome"

1k7LIZVWaa	Don't talk shop to your husband if it bothers him.  He sounds like he has double standards.  He should trust you and not get jealous but if it's an issue, I would avoid the topic.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I think that your husband also have some insecurity issues and that is playing a big part in his actions.  My wife has many male friends at work and school and I enjoy hearing the interaction that happens between them, but in my younger days I'm sure I would have acted hurt and insecure also.  Give your husband a break and try not to talk so much about work, talk more about activities that you and him can do, he will grow out of most of his problems, so be patient.  Good luck.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Having guy friends at work is completely fine. I am married and have married male co-workers. The majority of them are male, and I'm not going to not speak to them because of it! Your husband is just insecure. <br>  <br>  I do not, however, think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out with a male coworker/friend for drinks or anything else outside of work. |`|2ikZxzBfaa	Of course its okay.You have to know his intentions first.Some say women & men can't be friends which in some situations is true.As long as your true to your husband and not a flusie you should be alright|`|oqX0PwQiaa	He sounds very immature. Guy friends at work would not bother me but friends with benefits would. If he told you that he couldn't resist then maybe you shouldn't either.|`|T0RQRFLWaa	If he has female friends, then he cannot tell you you can't have male ones!!<br>  <br>  I don't believe he doesn't  have female friends at work - most people make friends of BOTH genders. I also don't like the comment he made when you asked about the possibility of being alone with a woman who<br>  paid hm loads of attention - does that mean he would go as far as the woman wants? every man is capable of controlling his actions, and he has to learn to say no if this happens.<br>  <br>  He does sound incredibly immature, and needs to sort out his self esteem issues before his relationship with you can develop any further. Let him know he can trust you, but he has to learn to trust himself first and foremost. <br>  <br>  Suggest he gets counselling for his self esteem issues - if he doesn't, then you know where you stand, and it's your decision whether or not to stay with him<br>  <br>  Good luck - hope all goes well for you!!.|`|VMbMYcB0aa	well it sounds like he says its ok for a girl to be all over him but you can't even have any male friends. I think you deserve better there are plenty of guys who understand the difference between a friend and a lover. Most guys I know don't care if a girl has lots of male friends as long it's not suspicious like hanging out late all the time.|`|5ehjYRX8aa	yes, just as long as its limited to plain friendship, nothing more. as for the husband, less talk less mistake will apply. jealousy is a serious relationship problem. you could help him by making sure that there is nothing that he should worry for.|`|adetUhXiaa	Just reassure your husband that you would never act in a way with a guy that you would not do in front of your husband.|`|PPLxDKYwaa	If he wouldn't  be able to help it if some girl is all over him cos he's just a boy -  then why did u marry someone who wasn't a strong, dignified man!?|`|69e4a0516dfe2a2a32a1f5937bff7829aa	I think being nice to a co-worker is a good thing...but personal stuff...such as fights...loving...and stuff like that is best left out of the conversation....stop saying things about how "good" the new guy looks...I think you are not helping with talk like that....Guys are territorial so of course he gets upset with how good the new guy looks...so I think that you need to stop fueling the fire...I know I will get a ton of thumbs down...because people will say it is his fault and he is just insecure...maybe so but you did pick him...but honestly you can do your part...good luck|`|TaF6MS9kaa	YES!<br>  How insecure can you be to not "allow" your girl to talk with other guys? its ridiculous... The fact that he has no lady friends shouldn't affect you, it's his own choice. <br>  <br>  However,<br>  I don't get why ur telling him about other guys working out really hard if you already know he has issues with that. How would you feel if he talked you about other girls that are way hotter than you?...<br>  <br>  I don't know who's "fault" is it.. you should both talk things over cause its seems like your playing a little game of jealousy. Don't get me wrong - there is nothing wrong with playing as long as you both  secure enough in ur relationship , otherwise it will ruin ur relationship.|`|iEia6FQvaa	I lived with a jacka@# like this for 15 years and let me tell you, it never changes.  I no sooner started a job and if he got wind that any men worked there, then I must be sleeping with them.  It got to the point where I just never mentioned it if any men worked at my place of employment.  I never cheated on him, so I don't really know where it came from.  The only thing I could ever think of is that he cheated on me, because he went out to bars, talked to other women, talked to women at work, etc.  Men like this never change.  It's abusive behavior so you have to decide whether or not you want to live like that.|`|vULVL1jmaa	I think you are right about your husband's self-esteem being low. The fact that you can't so much as bring up another guy that you work with without him making accusations is crazy! I also find it very troubling that he uses his "I'm just a boy" reason to excuse the fact that he would cheat if ever alone with another woman. Thats right, he is just a BOY because a real man would never cheat on his wife. I suggest you look into marriage counseling. |`|55b55bab8a262bdb12b9c66cf2b528eeaa	yea hes feeling guilty! he knows what he would do in those situations so he thinks you will too. hes a pig and yea id say just don't talk to him about it. but beware this is something that usually doesn't stop here and his jealousy will get worse if he doesnt get a grip!! good luck with him, youll need it|`|LIT4FJvhaa	Yeah, sounds like your hubby has major issues.  How annoying.  You have to tell him to stop because if you enable him, it just gets worse.  It's a way of controlling you.|`|PHhHZMyiaa	Yea its called freedom to talk to anyone you want to as long as she is not cheating on you than why not?|`|0aYkw1Iiaa	You both sound young and dumb.|`|o91aq8wqaa	u needa not tell him about ur guy friends, and if he asks, lie, cuz men are natrually jealous.....
PcXAErL2aa	to me it seems that you've liked her from afar, and that your not close or friends. try set the situation up so you's have to talk. maybe you cant tell her straight to her face but drop subtle hints, flirt or tell her you love the way she's wearing her hair. try it that way  :) time will tell<br>  good luck|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Talk to her alot and always tell the truth because it really pays off. Don't worry about popularity, don't make yourself look low because if you do, she will treat you that way. Make your way up to a relationship over time(you can't get a girl in a day). Say what you feel like saying in conversations and get her to know how much you love her. Well than you know, you ask her out. =)

He is respecting his girlfriend and knows his boundaries. I would hope my boyfriend would do the same thing if he were ever placed in that situation.<br>  <br>  And not to be rude but I dont think your intentions are just to be his friend. As a woman I know! You are hoping that he will be your friend and someday realize that you are better than the girl he has now.|`|kBVXcQ34aa	Option 1: He likes you back - It can be awkward interacting with someone you are attracted to but can't do anything about. Coming across as 'best-buddies' would feel false (and he may worry look false). His natural tendency may be to lightly flirt with you, but he can't do that (and may not want to - guilt etc) as he is attached and surrounded by friends. He may just not know how to handle the situation and so is wary of making an idiot of himself.<br>  <br>  Option Two.<br>  He doesn't like you (even though I'm sure you're lovely). He's noticed a few unconcious indicators of interest from you and doesn't want to mislead you. He may worry that you will mistake friendliness for flirting, so has decided to steer clear.<br>  <br>  A little childish? Maybe. I would just say guarded, regardless of whether it's Option 1 or 2. <br>  <br>  If you want to be friends, you need to make the effort yourself and take the decision-making process away from him. Approach him. Let him know you're a cool person, establish a few in jokes. NO FLIRTING WHATSOEVER from you. He'll soon relax and see you as a friend. <br>  <br>  Just make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. If not, you should either respect that he doesn't want to disrespect his gf / be tempted into cheating, ........ or you should just get him drunk and give it a go. Good luck.
hl4kkvXhaa	As a woman, I can say that I like your attentiveness.  Once or twice a day, or every few days, isn't bad.  It's enough to let her know you're interested without being obsessively clingy.  It's the guys that answer within five seconds of my reply to them, when I'm saying I'm busy but glad we got a chance to say hello, that drive me up the wall.  Once or twice a day is refreshing compared to 33 or more messages a day!

Does she receive child support? Depending on your situation your mom may be able to get assistance from the state &/or county that will help her temporarily until she is "back on her feet". If you are bringing in the only income then I recommend you look into any type of assistance available for people in your area. Check with your local welfare agency, private groups(churches),etc., or any other local agencies that may be able to help you & your mom. Taking out a loan may help to get you two re-established but you will have to base your decisions on your specific situation and level of need. You are only a child and I can only imagine how streesful this is at your age. It sounds like you may need additional support from other adults (family, friends, teachers,etc.) so that you are not trying to do it by yourself. Reach out to your community.|`|o4cvNO9Aaa	may gog bless u dear after reading ur story tears started rolling in my eyes u r a very good child who want 2 support his mom i hope every thing will be ok i will always remeber u in my pray. and best of luck for ur bright future and have belive in god|`|rCl9matvaa	if you guys have a house you could take some money out of that but dont forget you have to pay back loans does your mother work and if not why/becare that guy sickle might get you a loan but it also could be 21% if you what to tell me more email me.if your mother is hurt might be able to get state aid for her and you|`|yGkd4Lszaa	If you are thinking about getting a loan, then you should know about the basics before you get started. If you understand the basic dos and don’ts of loans, then you will be better equipped to find the best loan for your needs. Whatever type of loan you are applying for, you should follow these basic rules to help you find the best deal. When searching for a loan, it pays to do your research. Look for as many suitable lenders as you can, so that you can find the very best deal. There are many online pages that<!--allow you to compare loan rates from a variety of lenders. As well as looking online, check out your high street banks and mortgage lenders for deals too. You may find the loan that you need here,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://best-loans.awardspace.com/" rel="nofollow">http://best-loans.awardspace.com/</a><br>  <br>  If possible, try and avoid taking out secured loans. If the amount you need to borrow is small or you have good enough credit to borrow without collateral, then do so. Although unsecured loans have higher rates, they are less risky because your home will not be at risk if you cannot make the payments.Try and take a loan out over the shortest period-->you can afford. Taking loans out over 10 years or more can be risky, and you cannot be sure what your financial situation will be at that time.

Depends on my attraction to them and their personality as usual I suppose.

I don't have any fetishes or anything, I had a thing for an indian girl a while back...never amounted to anything though.

But, confront them in a polite way, and in private (without your friend present). <br>  Ask them straight out if they have issues with you. If so, ask why. Be direct. If they are mature, they will appreciate your directness and honesty (if it is done right and not rude). Hopefully, they will see the error of their ways or your perception was wrong! <br>  You can then move on from there. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|AA12074299	do somthing nice to them first!<br>  <br>  it always work, and when you see them say "hi" and not "bye"<br>  <br>  be polite. they probly dont like by the way they see you or the way you act.|`|1abf50f958a3a62a419143a11a703af1aa	im like that 2 only its the other way a round.........slowly be more gentel to her parents go over 2 her house and say please,thank you,no that you,yes mam',no mam'...stuff like that they'll come around<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  thalya  xoxo
9fdaec064f164575ad314435bd230e97aa	Your sex drive is growing and especially if the sex was good you're expected to want it more and more. The thing is self control and self satisfaction. There are toys and stuff that could be used in order to help satisfy those needs. Don't be shy to walk into a sex shop and pick up a toy or two. My man is a lawyer and when I need sex as much as he is away, instead of cheating on him I had to resort to toys. I love him too much to cheat and I will be here waiting for him. You need to know what's more important, a good man or your sexual needs. <br>  <br>  Remember SEX SHOPS!|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Wait till your boyfriend gets back.

7Pc1FtSCaa	don't ever change yourself for anyone, it really is probably the age of the guys you are hanging around with, dont rush into something with someone who is going to be a jerk, its worth holding out for that special boy who'll let you know how amazing you are, for more than just how you look or how fast you jump into bed with him. believe me, although it might not seem like it, these boys do exist! <br>  wait it out, cause it'll be worth it when you find a boy who loves you for you :)<br>  x|`|oUtwWSdraa	they do but the first thing they see are looks.  that's just how we are.|`|Vfbuy6AWaa	that what i always wonder too! <br>  most guys r lik that but not all of them..its rare tho wen u meet a guy that is actually into u becuz of u nd not jus cuz ur pretty n stuff<br>  i guess itz jus that guys r jus like that haha idk <br>  im not sure either haha|`|NzZvAbnNaa	because guys are guys and they mature once you get older around mid high school and college and relize that looks aren't everything and personality counts too .

My boyfriend is always acting stupid and i would get so mad but then at the end of the day while were alone he's so sweet and i'd have no idea what i would do without him. He should NOTTT pressure u into doing something u don't want to. if he can't understand u don't wanna, and he keeps pressuring you, then you should break up with him. What kind of things does he say about your friends? Cuz for me, my friends are just as important as my bf and he should treat them with respect. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, its just what i thought of=]
SRvtcX3jaa	No not really, a date is when two people who like each other go out and get to know each other. Of course you could do double date, but when your with 6 people its hard to focuz just on your date when your joking around with your friends, telling another friends about what your doing tommorow, etc. But when your younger its fine, when I was younger we use to do that all the time as a date, so that one friennd didnt get nervous. So I guess for younger people it could be called a date. Butt oh well as long as you had fun =)

xBoBd3JAaa	Yes I think he should. At least I would let you have a second chance. Jealousy is something that is tough to get in controll of but it isn't impossible. <br>  <br>  Just talk to him that you do still love him and that you were having the best time when you were with him.<br>  <br>  See what he says and I'm pretty sure you will get a second chance.

iuLn4bNtaa	I think it's better not to date him right now. You don't need to have a guy that likes you 50% you deserve 100% so don't push yourself to settle for this.<br>  <br>  Give him time to make up his mind, if he likes you more he'll be back, if he doesn't. Next! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TPmP9UMbaa	Go for it, if the other girl he likes is your frend then she wont do anything with him to make him cheat on you.

Or, you dont have to steady date them, you could go out on a date one night with one of them and see how that goes (make sure they know that for now it is just one date, and not to run around and call you thir girlfriend) Then go out one night with the other guy and you could see which one you like better that way. Dont rush into it so fast until you know for sure :O)|`|4iOMS2jaaa	Get to know them better, and then make your descision. :) Good luck!|`|HHvbJSXHaa	I say definitely wait and see because you might choose one and end up regretting it and wanting the other guy back.

8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	It's really simple. If he likes you, he'll ask you out. If he really really likes you, he'll ask you out and stop going out with other girls. If he really really really likes you likes you, he'll ask you out, stop going out with other girls AND stop flirting with other girls.<br>  <br>  I think you might want to stop letting him hug you and save that kind of contact for guys who really really like you like you.  Sometimes flirty guys don't realize what they want until a girl turns her back on him.  Being too easy and available means you're not someone he gets  to chase or win.
LaTpaH2Faa	I would ask him what he really thinks about me.|`|5GWX6QpPaa	id ask if they liked me....ima bout 2 ask a dude this<br>  lol<br>  hmmm <br>  id ask how far have u been|`|AA10257112	i would asked them if they were happy and what would make them happy?|`|AUokrcCIaa	why the heck won't he leave me alone?

It's way too complicated. Especially if they get together and then break up because then he will be your ex's best friend and your best friend's ex. <br>  I know it's hard but you have to think of your ex and your friend.

There are only two choices open to you.  get over it and go to court, or risk upsetting your partner by not going.  I have, I'm afraid, always thought people who tear themselves up over their partners past will end up tearing up the current relationship.  Why on earth should you be angry about her behaviour to him?  That isn't your fight to have.  Basically in the modern age, people get together and people cheat and people break up... it's more the norm than the excpetion these days... yet people still get SO hung up about 'cheating'.  Just one point 'what he let happen' is inaccurate.  He did not 'let it happen', he was instrumental and active in it being done.  'Let happen' implies passivity.  However, if you want to go down that line, then if it was not actually him who put up the pictures but his mate, then surely it is his mate who is guilty of the offence of displaying obscene material..... so why doesn't your partner rely on that defence (may well get his mate into trouble, but there's gonna be some fall out from this inane and childish piece of behaviour).  Personally, given your recent questions about this bloke wanting  you to give him a golden shower, I'd have to say that he sounds a bit of a creep.....|`|Y7CH521faa	He won`t necessarily go to prison.

I know that you love him but you really must think about what kind of person he is. You must remember that at one time he loved his ex....how could he do that to her. Be careful, one day you might piss him off enough and he might to something like that to you. She was wrong to cheat on him but what he did is so much worse. She didnt deserve what he did to her.

She is his ex, they had a relationship it their own right and it's non of your concern...If she hadnt cheated he'd probably still be with her..So you should really be grateful for that...<br>  <br>  All I can suggest is support, don't make this about you, cos it's really not. Its about her, being humiliated and wanting to exact her revenge...Which is entitled to and I'd do the same!! <br>  <br>  If he's got a clean slate otherwise, he probably won't get a prison sentance as long as he's remorseful. Sounds like he'd be a fool to not admit it... He should just say I was wrong, Im an idiot and I hugely regret any distress I have caused....<br>  <br>  Its really easy to let other peoples problems get to you...I was really fraught at the beginning of this week after my mate had been having personal troubles...But I realised it wasnt my issue to get upset about....<br>  (I also personally would be very careful about any photographs he may take of you!)|`|OJj1hmPUaa	Unfortunately no matter how much you worry you are still going to court and always expect the worse so you dont get any surprises. you might not even see her there anyway cos he has already admitted the offence.Im speaking from experience.

STNqFiOfaa	... und wenn sie keine Brille tragen, dann kriegen sie halt voll was in die Fresse.<br>  <br>  Jaja, diese Sprüche! Und das Zusammenleben der Generationen verwahrlost. Nicht zu vergessen, dass es Eltern gibt, die schon lange kein Gespr?ch mehr mit ihren Kindern geführt haben. <br>  <br>  Frag doch mal telefonisch in der Praxis nach; man kann Dir dort sicherlich Auskunft geben.
daqOilaBaa	Wow, I'm not sure you could have written anything worse.<br>  <br>  Seriously, why didn't you just play it cool? <br>  <br>  No girl wants a guy who is a quivering baby. You have to treat them like dirt and show them NO RESPECT to get them to like you, or to get her back.<br>  <br>  Try it I bet it works, good luck dude.|`|AA12184732	just tell her how you still have feelings for her and see what she says.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Marry who you want. Your father wont be the one living with him, you will. If this Alex treats you good and loves you then you marry him. The world is becoming a smaller place and the old ways are over with. Its not your fathers place to pick your husband.|`|AA12198711	Being Kurdish you have you're beliefs of the Kurdish people. It is up to you to follow those beliefs or make you're own beliefs and wants and needs to become reality.<br>  <br>  You're father is from a completely different generation from you and he is stead fast on his beliefs and there is probably nothing you can do to change his ways. But respect him and honor him as much as you can.<br>  <br>  If you truly love this man and he truly loves you and the commitment is true then make the best of it and make a life together. You're father may be hurt and never accept it but that is something you have to accept when you make you're decision.<br>  <br>  And to the answer above: the father is not trying to pick her husband for her, he is letting her know that it is his belief as a Kurdish that she marry within the Kurdish beliefs. That is all.<br>  <br>  Follow you're heart dear. Just make sure you're heart is sending you in the right direction.

a69af2f7a27d946cf945135ff2fe59c3aa	Not proud, but when I was 16 or so, I took people's charity money for a fund raiser and spent it on drugs. =(|`|T1prmBZfaa	This is horrible and i cant believe i am admitting this since i never have. Once i was sleeping over my friends house and her cat just had kittens and  she had them in a box on the side of her bed, well i woke up in the middle of the night and i must have stepped on one and i killed it. The next morning she found it and was all upset and i lied and said "yeah that can happen with newborn kittens its like SIDS but with cats, sometimes they just die"<br>  <br>  <br>  I felt horrible.
agLImxKTaa	You don't.  He's already living with someone else.  He has moved on.  I know you don't want to hear it but so do you.  Stop making excuses.  Vows say for better or worse and as soon as things got worse, he bailed and found someone else.  Do you really want a man like that back?  What happens next time things get overwhelming?  If after only 2.5 years he couldn't love you enough to work on the marriage, that's a bad sign.  And you had all the time before he met her to ensure he never left you.  You're both at fault here.  Marriage is a partnership.  Neither of you seems like you know how to work together.  |`|bO2rzfISaa	OK, say this really is the best choice for you. Why not get some therapy to talk it through? If you're strapped for money, go to the minister at your church. Give yourself say, eight sessions before you make a plan of how to get him back. Good luck|`|lN5d688gaa	been there.  is he worth it?  do you miss him or are you just lonely?  he moved on to another girl so fast.  you need to take some time and think things through.  give it time.  if he really loves you he will come back.  but just make sure that he is coming back for you not just for your child together then it's not worth it<br>  <br>  good luck|`|kP8spj7Daa	Take up witchcraft and cast a love spell on him.  It won't work, but you are too hard headed to listen to reason and get on with your life.  |`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Ask him to move back home and seek counseling.|`|AA11587827	move on sweetie, really sometimes we do what we have to do|`|AkUhaMm9aa	well if you are willing to forgive that hes living with another woman and you are going to trust him...(but i think the idea of him leaving for another woman will always stay in your mind) then, you should arrange a dinner with him to talk about things and tell him that you are willing to give the relationship a chance and start over, even get couseling...if he agrees..the condition is that he leaves that other woman asap, and moves back to the house. if he loves you and his family he will make the effort, its something you both have to work on...not just you.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|XWwQWSWGaa	Start the process of moving on with your life.  Don't do things that will make him jealous as that would be playing games and you don't want to do that if you want him back.  Get a hobby, go out with friends, go out with family, just do what makes you happy.  When he sees how happy you are without him, he'll want you back.  |`|AA11958479	totally go out with your male friends and have a blast, big time fun and dont stop to think how he is doing. just go on about your day acting like nothing is bothering you. act to busy to talk to him if he ever calls. just pretend like your life is normal and he will come back wondering why you didnt feel hurt and want your love again. |`|89Zea1DVaa	i wish i could tell you what to do because i would have my ex back as well he has to want to come back did he talk to you saying he wants to try again if not did you go to him and ask to try again if not do so and see what he says don't put your hope to high then you will re live the break up all over again god bless|`|yI9uOxXVaa	Talk to him, have a serious talk where you both will not get interrupted, tell him how you feel, and then work out a plan that you both agree on how to get your marriage back together. It will be painful and a lot of work but you can do it.|`|iG61L6vxaa	Let him see you out with a male friend but let him think that he's more than a friend.  I usually KILLS them to see you with someone else.  |`|FU2a2WSiaa	I wouldn't say give up, try and talk to him just the two of you. Offer a night out just you and him and lay all the cards out on the table. Let him know exactly how you feel and what you want. If you pour your heart out to him and he's not willing to except it, then it's time to move on. But if he's in love w/ you the way your in love w/ him than everything will work out. But if his feelings just aren't there anymore you cant make him love you and take you back. There are "other fish in the sea" that will make you as happy as your husband once has. <br>  <br>  Good luck :-) |`|pOTigVYPaa	First of all, you need to ask your husband if he still loves you and if he wants to get back together with you.  If he doesn't then don't waste anymore of your time.  If he would consider reconciliation, then ask him to start attending marriage counseling sessions with you.  If money is an issue, you can try going to a public mental health center which will do counseling on a sliding scale and sometimes for free.  Money isn't a stupid reason for fighting.  It's the number one reason for divorce in this country!  Money and the way it is spent in a family does matter.  Having a new baby is a real stressor in new marriages.  It takes maturity and a lot of adjusting on the part of both husband and wife. Parenting classes are also a wonderful option.  I think there's hope for the two of you, but it will take both of you wanting to make it happen.  Good luck to you both!|`|F0rbWQL8aa	Is he still in your baby's life?  You can of course dress to impress.  Be kind.  If the opportunity presents itself, ask him if he thinks the two of you would be able to work things out.  Tell him you feel guilty that you gave up so quickly.  Tell him you feel like you owe it to your child to try it out again.  If he is telling your mom he isn't happy, then he knows it will get back to you.  Maybe he wants you back, too.|`|kWNpHjy6aa	There's a difference between crying because he's unhappy with his gf or crying because he misses you. Once you figure out which once he's crying about, you can go from there.<br>  <br>  If it's because he misses you, invite him over under the pretext of talking about the baby. When he gets there, make sure you're wearing suggestive clothing, complete with wardrobe malfunctions. That's what would work for me anyway.|`|74mG28g0aa	He is with the other woman for a reason. If he loved you,he would be with you. If giving up is not an option......it sounds o me like you both need counseling, especially with a child involved.|`|30y4zlOgaa	Respect yourself more.Be confident Act like you are happy. Act like it don't bother you he's gone. <br>  It'll drive him nuts. He's miserable and your happy. When says something about coming home. Even though you want him too. Say something like Gee , you know I am enjoying being by myself. No one to argue with ITS PEACEFUL. Peace is a precious commodity. I just have to cook  clean after me and the baby. <br>  <br>  Remember be happy and confident. String him a long teach him a lesson.Maybe he'll think before he strays again. Men want what they can't have.Don't you ask him back. You don't want him to think you are desperate. Men don't like desperation in women. Plus he'll think he can walk all over you like a door mat. |`|QGKRPlz0aa	Ga. girl- haha I have to agree only on the fact that men are simple creatures. When it comes to my friends breaking up after long term relationships its usually the man who jumps into a rebound because they fear they're own feelings and emotions (and yes I'm totally generalizing forgive me). Stop begging him to come back, stop acting desperate, men hate that. Remember the saying "If you love it, let it go" If he really loves you still he will come back, if he doesn't don't you think you're better off not being with a man who doesn't love you? It is rough I know but you will get through it. Best of luck to you!

Just ask him and if he gets furious about the question then your onto something, if he looks at you like "wtf?" and says that that's the furthest thing from his mind then maybe he just likes having sex with you more. Other ways or finding hairs, smelling strange purfume, he's taking showers at odd times, or finding other women's belongings around the house or in his car and that sex smell.

Like I said, relationships always have some degree of seriousness, but there need be fun too. Try and have a balance of both.I can see why you turned him down though. You can find someone more to your preference soon enough...
ugIYOK91aa	You're not married to your boyfriend, are you?<br>  You're not engaged just yet, right? No ring, no children, no crazy future plans?<br>  If you're just in a casual relationship with someone there's no harm in liking another man -- I can guarentee you that he's looked and fantacized about other women. And you two aren't attached to each other -- there's no long-term commitment signed -- so there's no harm in looking at other options. <br>  I'd just forewarn you that you shouldn't actually make a move on this other guy until you at least have the courtesy of breaking things off with the b/f. But fantacizing? That's 100% healthy. Everyone does it.|`|Cz4qXe4Caa	Well, which guy would you rather be with?|`|bMoWvzXdaa	if u feel ur boyfriend is not the one go for the other guy! there is someone out there for u and that guy might be him! or ur boyfriend might be him... if u have more questions about anything ask me at<br>  <br>  askme_askhailey@yahoo.com|`|wM4y5Pz3aa	i mean its not good bu its not bad either. no body is perfect, some pple are better then others, so i guess that guy that u like is better then your BF and thats why u like him. <br>  who do u want to be with?? your Bf or  that guy that u like?

paURq79Daa	"hoe i can propose a girl to whom i like?"<br>  <br>  First and foremost, when approaching an audience for romantic advice don't refer to them as a "hoe." But if you do propose I hope you two love each other very much and find the best of happiness. Try and tie your proposal into something she enjoys or even just go very romantic with traditional images of romance, or some of her own, or some of your own as a couple.|`|fnBvcAV0aa	if u like someone solve her probelems one by one and become a friend of her than see one day not u she will propose you and want to marry u.|`|9YfPTfdWaa	Hahaha... boys this is something that should come from your heart! Use your creativity! The possibilities are endless... Think about how/where you met.. her favorite places, her dreams, places she wants to see... make it romantic.. and the more creative the better! I think if you think about this yourself... because you really only know her... she will like it best.. but just for some little ideas.. i heard of private sunrise boat cruises... the place where you met, etc... just make sure its extra romantic.. with flowers, candles, etc.. women love it! Good luck and congrats!|`|9f126a5c02b5978896d29ab8ede46fdbaa	Don't propose. believe me. When you propose to a girl then she will know that you really like her and she will be your top priority in life. this will make her more "hard to get". better flirt with her instead. if she flirts back, well that means that she likes you. but still, don't propose to her. wait for her to make the first move then make for the other move, then presto! you now have a deep relationship with her. thats all there is to it..  =D|`|cd98b5607a4d0d66f5806c45d0313ba2aa	you sould follow simple way just tell her that you are beautiful girl and you lyk her and you want friendship with her. you know i am also goin to addopt this way.|`|evfrhHpBaa	definitely.. go ahead im with u...|`|oREeytpfaa	1] invite her on a dinner.<br>  2] gift her a yellow rose for friendship.<br>  3] have a nice dinner with some romantic song.<br>  4] wear what she likes.<br>  5] finally pay the bill and give a red rose for proposing.

If you do want to get closer to him without being to obvious ask him to hang out once in a while.  This way he can still make the first move but you can show him slowly that you like him. Its never a good idea for a woman to make the first moves.  To me it shows that your desperate.
XX0MRXtmaa	Do an investigation. See if he continually stares at you or someone else. And don't worry. If you're not ready, then just secretly hide your feelings for him until you're ready to express your love to him. Or, you can ask a friend (if you have one) to ask this crush of yours if he likes you. But it needs to be someone who you really trust, or else he/she might spread the whole thing to the world.

1QYgkf5Vaa	I think alot of it is age. The older I got the more self confidence I got. I also felt more comfortable with myself as I got older. It is hard at 15 because the high school life  is different world than the adult world. Just be your self and take chances sometimes. Try doing something that you may not usually do and see how it feels.|`|VNVkgPuAaa	well, i think its because you're probably extremely self-concsious. i used to be like that, even though im a girl, but after i hit eighth grade i kind of got tired of worrying about what other people think of me, so i screwed it and just kind of did what i felt like doing. next time you go out, observe what other people are doing. if you look at them and dont think what theyre doing is embarassing on their part, and just move on, chances are the people you think might think you're weird, etc. are doing the same thing. they'll give you an absent-minded look, but wont sit there and think "omg that kid was so freaking strange because he SAT there." people dont hold grudges to others that are their own person. so just try to keep it natural and dont worry so much about the other people around you.|`|YcP9HN3waa	I know how you feel.  I've had periods of my life where I have been painfully shy.  Unfortunately it has never gone away completely but it has gotten a lot better.

Just practice feeling confident in yourself and know that things will get better.

8846f0723125b971fca35939e79a874daa	Well, they're not going to stop or start looking at such things based on what you say or anyone else says.  It's going to come from within them.<br>  <br>  I think productive men quite simply don't have time for it.  I guess that's about as strict as I get on the matter.  If you've got things to do, you're probably not wasting much time with it, or on masturbation.<br>  <br>  However, there are a lot of lonely men.  Or men who have busy, stressful careers; and for reasons of ugliness or other social constraints upon them, they can't have a girlfriend.  In that case, if masturbation has become an often habit, then it's probable they might have visual stimulation to accompany it, time to time.  Should this likelihood be shocking?  It seems probable to me.  If the man is otherwise a fully productive member of society, but uses those means as a masturbation aid, and then returns to his productive life and forgets about the porn ... while not a perfect existence ... truly, what business is it of mine?<br>  <br>  I agree that it's not the best employment for women.  But if I disagree with such people, I don't have to have coffee with them.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's akin to the gun-control debate, now that I think of it.  You know how some pro-gun-rights people say, "Guns don't kill people, people kill people"?  Well, I don't entirely agree with that, but I sort of do.  I think that if you have guns around, it increases the probability that you can physically kill somebody.  But it doesn't definitely mean that you will.  In the aggregate sense, however, there might be a small correlation.  Same, perhaps, with porn and odd/violent views about women and sex: Maybe being neck-deep in porn will raise the probability of criminal activity and repulsive viewpoints, but it doesn't necessarily entail it.<br>  <br>  Regardless, the best we can all do is get our own houses together first, right?  And just live that example.<br>  <br>  So while porn exists, and erotica has always existed, it's one of those things that we personally can choose to not have as a part of our lives.  And that's about it.<br>  <br>  It's like going to the grocery store.  Pick what you want out of produce, and leave the rest there.  But I'm not going to curse out the manager for stocking rutabagas, just because I don't like rutabagas and wish rutabagas were out of my sight.  I'm just going to choose to not spend my time and money on rutabagas.  And if another person wants to sample some rutabagas, live and learn, pal.  lol.<br>  <br>  I often find that people who live rightly are often content and naturally silent about personal morals (while perhaps being a bit more vocal about social injustices).|`|ZKPLzAE6aa	well, it depends on how you look at it you see.<br>  I mean if you are a religious guy, then i guess you should look into ur heart and hear what it says.<br>  <br>  well, if u look it another way, well i guess its part of growing up. one day u'll realise its bad and maybe wat u need is a relationship with a girl.<br>  good luck|`|41qjiWDnaa	It is absolutely wrong.  It distorts the true meaning of what a sexual experience is to symbolize.  It also shows a lack of respect for women, and in some cases even men.  The seed of lust can spill over into the persons real world and may view what is seen as something that should be expected of a partner.  Most women cannot live up to that expectation, or even into a weirder type of sex, depending on what type of porn you are watching.|`|D6OdNyhRaa	There's nothing at all wrong with porn.<br>  Healthy people know it's only fantasy and not at all like real life.<br>  Men are much more visual creatures than women, so it helps them with masturbation (a healthy activity).<br>  It can also be a bit of fun for couples to watch together.

xCoFY8Yiaa	Think about why you are ex's. There is a reason. Now this guy at church, is nice, he goes to church, etc. I think you should just go up and talk to him. give him your phone number and ask him to call. I know guys are supposed to be the forward ones, but sometimes they need a little push. If he doesnt call, he doesnt call. Its not the end of the world, but at least you would know.

If she is homosexual, she is probably afraid of how society would treat her. You are her friend. Let her know that you are not into her like that. But don't be cruel. Kids are cruel. They tend to not be very understanding with things like this. They might shy away from her. How do you think that she would feel if her best friend ditched her? Stick by her and stand up for her. I have many homosexuals and bisexuals as friends, and sometimes, they are treated very cruelly. If she really is your friend, you will look past it and let her know you are there for her. If you had a guy friend who always hit on you and liked you a lot, would you ditch him? No. Just because she is of the same sex, does not mean you should do that to her.|`|CVdVwWPGaa	theres noting wrong with that im bi|`|XVvCahfqaa	Well first try to figure out for sure if she's lesbian or not.

qOfIYukwaa	If your friend is trying to apologize, then give her another chance....Just ONE chance...who knows, maybe she'll change. Instead of getting to the heart of the matter (From The Very Beginning Of The Friendship) and fixing it, you let the negative feelings build up inside and now you're not speaking to her. your friend is probably confused to why you don't want to hang out and now she's all up in your face. i know you told her "why' you didn't want to see her, but you should have gave it another try. if she is still doing the same old stuff from before, then let her go.|`|nFILcxsSaa	i think u should tell her all u feel an take da way she said sorry as a fact of forgiving her or just ingnoring her. just out of curiasity if she has been ur friend 4 a long time then u should try to help u an her not fight

If he's not talking to you and you're hurting to think about this, is that really want you want, to be hurt? Plus, I'm sure there's a lot more guys out there that are just waiting to court a girl just like you :).|`|mwewiODzaa	i am in the exact position. sort of, mine is alittle different. however, you want him to want you. hm i think by saying that you want the attention. every girl wants the attention from every cute guy around. but when you are with a group of people and he is the only make that makes you feel werid/get butterflies in your stomach then you probably like him. also, see if you flirt with him more than any other guy. those are pretty good signs that should clear it up for you =) good luck!

QVM7PhXMaa	He doesn't love you at all or respect you if he is sleeping with you while with another girl. He doesn't love or respect her either. He's a total pri*k and thinking only of his wiener if you ask me. This guy does not deserve you. He is using you as a piece of meat. If he is so willing to cheat on his current live in girlfriend then he is no good scum. You need to stand up and just end it. It's going to be hard but you have to realize he doesn't appreciate you for who you are. He's just using you. LEAVE HIM!!! STOP SLEEPING WITH HIM!!! See if he sticks around if you don't allow him to use you as a booty call.|`|ZDSJ42Piaa	wow lots of things going on there, I say cut all ties.  Telling the other girl is your choice.

17c1554d506a01f5fd4cc5a85b71b4a0aa	just what you said here that you think he is sweet. Honesty never hurts.
FO5WFDCJaa	Forgive me for being shallow, but are you attractive?|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	You are dating some serious nancy-boys there. They're trying to tell you that it's not going to work out, but they're trying to spare your feelings. Admirable I suppose, but it's only giving you false hope that it might work out someday. Try dating a real man, one that will flat out tell you it's not going to work out or one that will at least give it a shot.|`|sfDq3s97aa	There are lots of reasons that it could not of worked out. But after reading one of the things that you said, something stuck in my head. You wrote. <br>  <br>  "I txt them when they txt me, I listen to them when they call, and flirt back when they flirt with me. I haven't chased any of them, I have been sitting back and being very calm, cool and collected about them."<br>  <br>  What I took from this is that you have been putting in no more effort than just responses to things. If I went out with a girl like this I would probably not want more from her either. I think most people want someone who is willing to express themselves and take chances. In most cases when I have gone out with someone who only responds to what I am doing then I feel as though it will be my sole responsiblity to make both of us happy. I feel like it means i will be in more of a one sided giving relationship with just getting some things now and then in return. <br>  My suggestion is don't worry about being calm, cool and collected. Be who you are. Playing games and pretending to be something you may not be is not truly letting them know who you are. If you are a passionate lady show that. If you are someone with a great sense of humor show that also. If you want more than just a few communications in a day then show that also. This way they will know the real you and be able to make a judgement on whether this is what they are looking for.<br>  I hope this helps. I was not picking on you at all. I just have often seen to many people playing the game of dating instead of being who they really are and concentrating on finding the right match in return.<br>  Good luck|`|4UHQZKSkaa	hi babygirl, dont b too emotional. ur bhavior makes them feel u r desperate in need of a guy. never mine, they were not meant 4 u, bc i dont think its a crime u show sb love.but know that, nowadays, men want ladies u dont give a dam.<br>  listen, u must not attend every date u r been invited to.moreover, from evry 5 calls, made, u have 1.<br>  also dont b too generous, jus b urself til when u feel like sharing,|`|AA10081961	They sound like jerks.... What they want is to be friends. Friends with "benefits".  Cut them all out your life, you don't need immature idiots like that flirting and texting and just generally sending mixed messages.

9GKvZM6Taa	1. Someone who sees the best in you. <br>  <br>  If you were lucky enough to grow up with healthy parents, you have experienced the feeling of having someone who has always looked at your good qualities. Many of us missed that experience. You will be a lucky person if you have found a mate who is always looking at your 'silver lining'. Too often today people are more than willing to judge you by your errors, not by your potential. <br>  <br>  2. Someone who gives you the benefit of the doubt. <br>  <br>  There are so many times in your life when you need that little edge, that little opportunity to take just that extra step. It can seem as if your efforts are going nowhere and although you want to keep moving forward, there are so many negatives staring you in the face. That person who knows things could go either way for you but takes that leap to believe you will make it is the person who is more valuable to you than gold. <br>  <br>  3. Someone who watches over you. <br>  <br>  You need a guardian angel who is there, waiting to catch you if you fall, ready to help you when you stumble, ready to pave the way for you when you cannot get moving. There are people who love you who do just that. There are people who do not make a big deal out of saving your bacon. Do you know who they are? <br>  <br>  4. Someone to watch you back. <br>  <br>  You never know these days who is waiting to catch you off guard, to make sure you don't do well, to sabotage your efforts. You like to think that people will rejoice when you <br>  <br>  do well. Many don't. If someone 'has your back' and runs interference for you when you are trying to run the gauntlet through life, give that person a big 'thanks' plus lots of your attention. <br>  <br>  5. The person who tells you we all make mistakes. <br>  <br>  You hate to be around that judgemental, harsh person who reminds you, 'I told you so', when things so south. You don't need anyone else telling you what you already know. On the other hand there are people who just let you know that the only way any of us learn is through experience. When you have really ended up in the dumper and blew it, stay close to the one who knows that the person who hasn't done anything wrong hasn't done anything much. <br>  <br>  6. The person who gives you advice from the heart, not from the head. <br>  <br>  When the situation gets rough and some big decisions need to be made, it's fine to have people outline the pros and cons of a problem and give you 'head' answers. But if you need a nudge sometimes to tip the scales, you always listen to this person who knows you must do what will let you live with yourself and have self respect. <br>  <br>  7. The person who won't be the 'yes man' who agrees with you <br>  <br>  No one who loves you is going to give you the green light and tell you to let er rip if it's clearly going to be bad for you. It's sad that often you surround yourself with people who tell you what you want to hear. The one who loves you will tell you to get help for a drinking or drugging problem, to stop the extramarital affair, and to be a good and decent person. <br>  <br>  8. Someone who tells you to knock back, smell the roses, and enjoy life part of the time. <br>  <br>  If you are a person who is a real performer and doer, there are likely to be people around you who enjoy the fruits of your labor and want you to do even more. Sometimes you may even see yourself as only valuable when you are giving, doing, and performing. Listen to the person who tells you that life is short and you need breaks and some R&R. That is the person who is looking out for you and your health. <br>  <br>  9. The one who smiles at you and means it. <br>  <br>  The person who loves you looks at you with eyes that smile and mean it. Too many people give you that slick smile, that quick pat on the back, and then forget that you even exist. <br>  <br>  The eyes are the windows of our soul and you can read into a person's smile if it is saying, 'You are a fine person and I want to be with you as long as possible'. Don't fall for any phony smile that attracts you off in another direction, only to leave you stranded and alone. <br>  <br>  10. Someone who sees you as beautiful, inside and out. <br>  <br>  You know you aren't perfect. There are only too many examples of you looking around and thinking that you have flaws and aren't like the people on television. The person who loves you sees you through eyes of acceptance with no conditions. As you gain a few pounds and your hair gets thin, the person who sees you as attractive, inviting, and appealing is the person who loves you all the way, no strings or demands. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, it's really important to know who loves you. Everything in our society is throw away, and many people have carried that over into the most important relationships in their lives. Think hard and look carefully. People who love you , like comfortable clothes, are easy on the heart, mind, and soul. <br>  <br>  Hope dis will help u.......|`|hfKiY6xsaa	You can def tell when she starts to want to hangout more with you.

ePFMmGFHaa	Yes.|`|rmC8jxrTaa	Love is a CHOICE.  Lust is a feeling.  We choose how we respond to circumstances.  If two people are willing to work and compromise and CHOOSE to love the other person, then most likely any problem can be overcome.|`|AA10726325	No, love is not always enough.

lY8QLT2Vaa	lets be serious... ur missus should not be pressuring u into this position . Any guy in this predicament would feel awkward if not unwanted.You need to talk about it with her, be open and sit down and sort it out , even if it means an argument.... as for wanting another guy involved im sure this is not directly related to you or ur performance , some women fantasize about having threesomes and the fact that u agreed to it makes her think that theres nothing wrong with her wantin this.Adding another person to the mix .. especially from a guys perspective can back fire with it making u feel inadequate.... u need to talk and work out wat it is that u both want ... if u dont want to go through with it u should find out wat her other fantasies are and act them out... maybe she wants u but wants it a little dirtier. good luck|`|57phollPaa	NO.  YOU ARE THE ONLY GUY SHE SHOULD BE SLEEPING WITH.   IT IS NOT OK FOR HER TO SLEEP WITH OTHER MEN.  BUT IT IS OK FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH OTHER WOMEN.|`|gJhxdJ4haa	OMG, I am fairly open minded but I think threesomes are plain wrong. You need to tell her straight out, no mucking around, that her fantasies are soul destroying & she should stop immediatly. <br>  Tell her she is acting horribly, that her fantasies make you feel unattractive & unloved. You have a right to know if he loves you, if she finds you sexy. Demand an answer, dont be fobbed off either, get that answer.<br>  The fact you didnt object when she first raised the issue also smacks of you not being comfortable stating your dislikes. I might be reading too much into it but are you two happy with eachother? If you cant comfortably object or state with no hesitation you dont want other people in your marriage bed, then I feel you have a few problems.|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	It's quite common to feel like this when your spouse first brings up the idea of swinging (and yes, a threesome between a committed couple and anyone else is technically swinging).  You wonder why they would want more than just you, like you are not enough for them, or they are not in love with you, etc.<br>  <br>  Most of the time this is not the case whatsoever.  Some people are more sexually adventurous and can separate love from sex better than others.  Some people get to a point in their relationship where they know their spouse is "the one" for them forever and everything else is just icing on the marriage cake.<br>  <br>  In short, it's not replacement sex, it's just additional sex.<br>  <br>  My wife and I have been swinging for about four years. We started swinging not because we were bored, we were anything but that! We got to a point in our relationship where we were secure enough in ourselves, in each other, and thus in our relationship that we could express our fantasies to each other without fear of the other becoming jealous or hurt. Turned-out we both had many of the same fantasies, and they required more than two people in the bedroom to fulfill.<br>  <br>  Our already great relationship and abundant sex life has just gotten better, and tighter since. We know without a doubt that we are "it" for each other. We've had good sex with others and we not only still want each other, we crave each other. We are like two teenagers in love.<br>  <br>  But, you two need to sit down and really talk about what it is about swinging that turns you or her or both of you on. You need to listen to each other without judgment of each other and each other's feelings, which is sounds like you've already done very well. You need to tell her how you feel about it and what your fears are, your real fears, not your knee-jerk reaction fears. Usually what you think you fear and what you really do are two totally different things.<br>  <br>  Here's a great place to start with some good answers to your questions: The Swingers Board FAQ <a href="http://www.swingersboard.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=48" rel="nofollow">http://www.swingersboard.com/forums/foru...</a> and this one <a href="http://www.swingersboard.com/forums/showthread.php?p=267806#post267806" rel="nofollow">http://www.swingersboard.com/forums/show...</a> .<br>  <br>  Most of all, keep that line of communication open. I know just talking about it improved our open and honest communication 100-times over.  Doing it even more.<br>  <br>  Most of all, take advice from those that have been there successfully. I see way too many answers on Yahoo! Answers from those who have not only never experienced it, but the idea of is also terrifies them. It's like taking skydiving advice from someone that not only has never done it, but is afraid of heights to boot. You won't get advice, you'll just get opinions.
RzBjyzEzaa	I think he still likes you.  You shouldn't wait for him, ask him out yourself.  Don't go out with the other boys just because they ask.  It's hard to ask, but it will be worth it.  Good luck.
CtnGjoy7aa	Ok... dont use a cheap pick up line...   that will just make the girl run away. ( not litteraly)  anyways just kind of walk next to her and  and if she keeps looking at you in a good way then catch a glance and say hi and something like  were are you going, i'm going to...  that may lead into a great conversation.  hope that helps!!!!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah if you have any mormon friends or you are mormon... ask if you could go with them to one of their church dances..  there are plenty of girls there that are wonderful...  and ask them to dance...|`|c8XlLN6Naa	Well if you know anyone connected to her just say like, "alright, you're friends with____ right? " and she go"yeah, how do you know him?" and you go"____" say how u know em... Then say something like that ya went ta see some film recently(try and think of one with someone who looks like your mate) then say they look like so and so... then she will laugh and go"oh yeaaaah they do look alike" then you go, "I'm brilliant me" and she go yeah you are, then ask her out!!|`|0Z6rXQjgaa	first of all try to make eye contact with her let her know that your intrested then if that doesnt work try to find something wrong like   she dropped something and if that doesnt work just go up to her politley and ask her what her name is then from then go on to a polite easy conversation|`|X8NPvFQDaa	I do think it would be fine to just go up to her and say "hey, i'm ...."  <br>  It's not something most guys would do because they're too shy or too proud and would rathe rjust play it cool or whatever. Going up to her and saying that will make you seem confident and she'll definitely be intrigued and remember you if she's not a total jerk. <br>  Don't really make it seem like a rush but it's fine to say that your friends are waiting for you. Say that and also something like "see you later" or something like that.|`|rw6RK8QEaa	i think go to an underage club or go to a party<br>  at 15 you should be a freshman and sone parties should be avaliable to you<br>  it is the best place to meet people<br>  because usually everybody at the party is trying to meet somebody, so dance with them and make them laugh, you wont even have to ask for their number, chances are they'll ask you. <br>  once your like 16 or 17 , you are probably going to go to drinking parties which will make this 1000 times easier<br>  but yeah girls will ask you for your number or my space or to reach them if you know of another party and eventually they'll see you more often, you';; be their friend and if they like you , you'll know quite soon

BE VIGILANT.|`|0lgpvrJqaa	She seems to come across insecure and immature enjoys trying to have two guys on a string it makes her feel power-full and attractive. Its nice to hear a guy who doesn't easily give him self up, but has the sense to choice wisely, you will have a nice girlfriend in the long run that is also a good friend.. My mother always used to say don't sleep with anyone you are not close enough to that would not support you if a baby came into the world, nothing is 100 percent guaranteed against pregnancy and of course diseases as boring as this may sound it is a fact of life. You are a man with class dont let her touch your body like that in front of others you have confidence, she will make you look easy.|`|olOrpN6Kaa	sure she does want you 2 get in her pants 1st step ask her out 2nd step f*** her somewhere 3rd step get her pregnant 4th leave her as soon as you find out shes pregnant and finaly 5th she'll probably be so upset when she get kids you'll have our freedom then.
LwKqDmVxaa	The only things in life you regret are the chances you didn't take.  Ask her out!|`|kpUdLDQGaa	Yeah, ask her out.|`|5EeLgOP3aa	just go for it|`|BlIylicyaa	yes.<br>  <br>  but make sure you tell her that whatever happens, it shouldn't ruin the friendship.<br>  <br>  y'all started out as friends, and if things don't go well then you should end up as friends rather than enemies.|`|f8fWyN6Kaa	I think you should ask her out. There for, you'll have to think about the consequences, you know about your friendship, i guess it couldn't hurt. You never knows, ask her out before it's too late.|`|qDYSgGu5aa	u should before its too late...
RfjjVqrDaa	For the most part I think it's a hero thing, girls want to be rescued and a big tall man makes them feel feminine.  Not saying that you're not an awesome guy, but maybe her attraction to your friend is about more than just his height?  If you have feelings for her, consider asking her more about what she looks for in a guy and see if she's interested too or if she considers you an awesome friend (sux but it's a possibility)!|`|grceAVOvaa	Looks are the initial attraction, but honestly- she will probably end up with the guy who is honest and respectful and treats her the best. No matter how tall, short, fat, or built.<br>  <br>  Don't be shallow enough to think that you are so hot how could she resist!|`|6dW644Nvaa	I think that young women can have very superficial preferences when they are young. I am 5'2'' but dated many men over 6 ft. tall. My first love was 6'4''.  Maybe I was trying to make up for what I lacked. <br>  <br>  My husband is barely 5'6'' and I love him very much.|`|Iwkxrfytaa	tall guys are better to cuddle.. i'm '6''5 and not that fat but i have a drinking gut.. but i go to the gym twice a week and run like every other 2nd night like i have great leg muscles and arms but yeah i got a little gut but funny thing is i have a hot girlfriend :D and she doesnt care about the gut..

Sorry for my delay.<br>  <br>  Your second option is better but with a little change.  And, it is who is, not whoes.  Sorry it is the Mother in me.  LOL<br>  <br>  I have copied and pasted yours here:  My suggestion is below.<br>  <br>  I just thought the girl out of my dreams deserved a simple note like this. A very special person whoes always on my mind, will you be my valentine?<br>  <br>  I thought that the girl of my dreams deserves a note like this.  You are a very special person, who is always on my mind.  Will you be my Valentine?<br>  <br>  Yes, I would send this and yes, she will be surprised.  Let me know please.  Good job, Good Luck.|`|9dWp18DVaa	nice|`|T0vuy3zpaa	No its not corny, but add a little something more. Say I'm always thinking of you, a very special person in my life, so will you be my valentine?|`|Kl9nlsGNaa	thats not corny, thats cute. You should give it to the girl.
Qknj2fILaa	Talk to him about how you feel.  Who knows, maybe he feels the same as you do but is afraid to say anything?!?!  A great relationship starts with great friends.|`|FB8m2Qgraa	i would talk to him about it. explain how your feeling, that way you'll know if you should tell yourself to stop liking him or not.|`|LC85kp1saa	Sex isn't something you can just decide upon in one night. It is (or should be, atleast) a commitment towards another person. It should be out of love and trust for someone, and even then it isn't a good idea until marriage.<br>  <br>  My thoughts? First thing that came into my mind was that it was a stupid decision.<br>  <br>  My opinion? Think a bit next time.<br>  <br>  My advice? Always use protection, KNOW who you are sleeping with, try to wait until you're married (guess it's too late for that one.).<br>  <br>  If I were you... I would not let your fling with him effect your friendship, but still, don't pursue anymore sexual ANYTHING with him unless you are actual going out... and even then, it's not as precious until you are married.
OmTsqInzaa	Well, the positives outway the negatives. :-)<br>  <br>  Keep talking to him in person or e-mail. He should give more clues then.|`|raUQhLVeaa	Ya you never know till you ask =).|`|4hGa4C8kaa	I think he really likes u but gets kinda shy wen ur around. u should take a chance and ask him out. he did all those nice things 4 u..and the part where he didnt give u his phone number, maybe he fgt..and when he ignored u wen u said hi...was he with his friends? cuz if he was with his guy friends then he might have ignored u if he thinks that his friends dont like u...and u should talk to him more...u should make him feel comfortable around u so that he's not shy around u..maybe if u do that, he will ask u out himself.|`|kwDm5iL5aa	No! Wait till he shows more signs that he is interested in you. Men only treasure the women when he is the one who start to win her love. But those who woo him ones, will treated like nothing special.<br>  <br>  Be the special one in his heart!|`|KcXiM61Yaa	i think you guys should stay friends.<br>  he likes you as a friend for sure, but im not sure if he likes you as a crush.<br>  he's being a jerk because he just is.|`|i7Gqb6zzaa	He likes you.|`|to79eP2saa	he likes you<br>  since he's shy he will tend to do other things to try to avoid confrontation.<br>  just say you like him, and he might lossin up|`|Enqckjfcaa	its normal to be nervous (who isnt is my question???) tell him. all the signs point to him liking you|`|s6h6qE9Daa	NO ONE CARES YOU STUPID 14 YEAR OLD BRAT.<br>  Go listen to your Miley Cyrus songs.<br>  Go dream about your JO HOE BRO.<br>  <br>  Get a life.

bcbd792d199f7ebc897cc33f37ad366caa	Hun, I think the rumor in your past has made you self conscious and since things are going so well with you now you are fearing the worse. STOP!!!!!!   You're only making yourself crazy by having those thoughts. And if by chance someone says something, you are older and wiser now and can handle it a lot better. Have you hear the saying. "Never count your chickens before they hatch?" That's exactually what you are doing. Tenth graders are more maturer than eigth grades and play less childish games. Stop worrying. It's been two years. They've moved on, now it's your turn. Good luck hun.|`|kfP4tqRGaa	What they said about you in 8th grade was your past and now you go to a new school. Stop worrying so much and just enjoy what you have and the new friends you have made. No one needs to know what happened in 8th grade and if you dont do anything wrong it wont happen again.
juRWvc0eaa	Best advice is to stop looking. Seems to happen when you aren't looking. I know it sounds crazy, but it works.
668384f370243ce82995fb1ee72a5fb0aa	If he likes you, Lad will want to be with you, hang out, talk, etc.|`|Ig0cJtkgaa	glancing at you and looking away when you look, when you look at them they smile|`|LyR4LV0maa	well what they tend to do is like pick on you or they stare at you or sometimes they try to make a big seen out of stuff so they get reconised by you :-]|`|MdJPdyf6aa	Wow. It's different with different guys, but mostly it's when he:<br>  <br>  1. Tries to be close to you. For example, deliberately gets close to you when he has no need to, brushes past you often in hallways, tries to sit next to you,(only gutsy guys would do that) and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  2. Tries to touch you. For example, when you are talking to him, he casually touches your hand or arm, or he hugs you(big tip-off!) and all that.<br>  <br>  3. You catch him staring at you. If he blushes and looks away, this could be a sign that he likes you. Also for those over-confident guys, if you catch them staring at you and they hold the gaze for more than 2 seconds.<br>  <br>  4. They pay more attention to your friends. They might be doing this to get you jealous, or to get to know you or them better so they can ask them to ask you if you like him.<br>  <br>  5. You catch his friends staring at you or pointing at you slightly when they're with him, or teasing him and he blushes.<br>  Also if they ask you who you like or if you like him.<br>  <br>  6. He tries to impress you. If he does this, then you know you've got him. He could say, "Hey, ______! Watch this!" and he does something. If you don't talk to each other, you can tell nif he does something that would impress someone and he immediately looks at you.<br>  <br>  7. He lets you into his personal space. Or he tries to get into yours. Everyone has a personal bubble, and if you two have to be in each ithers for some reason, and neither of you attempts to move away, then he likes you.<br>  <br>  8. He copies you. I swear! Guys probably don't know that they do this, but they do. You can test it by, for example, if you are taking a test or watching a movie in class, moving or changing position every so often and seeing if they change their position too. They most likely will not do it right after you do, and they probably will vary it a bit, but they do copy you!<br>  <br>  9. He remembers little things about you that even you don't remember yourself! Like, him saying "You better study for that Math test, _____." Or, he mentions your name alot when he speaks to you.<br>  <br>  10. If he asks you out. WARNING! He may be doing it because of a dare. but then it would be public. If you are alone, or semi-alone, then he probably means it.<br>  <br>  !!!WARNING!!! Some guys are natural flirts and it may seem that he is giving you signals when he's not.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|oBnsPODXaa	once they start doing things to get your attention and its obvious lol|`|rsGwxNXCaa	If he's a tad obnoxious then he'll tease you more then he teases any other girl. If he ain't obnoxious then he'll be sweet to you and would try to hang out wih you as much as possible.
0f7fb381084577d7c9dbed88543bf19caa	Fact is guy have thick skulls, they don't like to be proven wrong, as in maybe he don't want to accept that you no long wanna be with him, as if it was a bad dream.  Also guys are for sure NO-mind readers, point out the obvious. Or else it will go on like you are talking about alot longer than what it should be.  If he gives you to much "hell" it can easily involve police, or court.  You just gotta do what need to be done, jsut its your decision, so do what you will.|`|d8t9ClAnaa	because he's probably afraid that if he lets go he wont be able to find another love...and he's probably considering the child as a reason to stay together as well....one night you need to take him, sit down, and discuss everything so he can understand what your trying to get through to him...i'm a guy and yes sometimes it can be very hard to let go of a woman you love....hope i could help & good luck|`|15073d45488fae699bfcc309901aa76eaa	Because he's the father of your child. Maybe you should reconsider. Do you really want your son growing up in a broken home?<br>  I suggest working through this for the benefit of your family.<br>  Unless there is some kind of physical abuse involved there is no need to run out on him.|`|AeBTrkxiaa	Wow does some on like u and u dont like him if you do not like him i think u should go out of his live NOW.<br>  YOU shuold tell ur family and if he dosnt leet you call the police,and when he is not in his home you should go out of the home, and if you want to take ur son take him and go to ur family!!!

Guys are almost always the same truth is sometimes after your hurt often you lose faith in finding a guy who will be honest and treat you right. You should talk to him but if his excuse is a pathetic lie (in otherwords he didnt even make the attempt to come up with a good believable lie) then let his sorry behind go. Guys like that will do it again and again untill you put your foot down and let them know your through and your not going to put up with their crap!!! believe me I know from experience.

In high school, teachers treat good looking students better and good looking students have more friends. To me, I feel people shouldnt judge others based on their looks, its very unfair to do that. Moreover, people wont realise that they have hurt average looking people by commenting on their looks. Looks are just basically a gift from God.|`|1z1Bn2T5aa	It's an instinct life is like that.......sad to say but it's true.|`|5K3RHn9Haa	well acctually i dont see it. I get alot of compliments from people i know... i know i am not ugly and because of it people tend to back away. They tend to think twice before they speak to me and tend to judge me as "conceited" before they get to know me better.

I often felt I could have anyone, anytime. Now I am 41, overweight, going bald, and wearing glasses. <br>  Now people call me "fat", "big guy", and don't give me a second look. (not that I am interested, but it would still feel good to be noticed).I have a wonderful wife, and 3 beautiful daughters. My oldest is athletic, tall, and can't keep the boys from drooling (at 14). My 12 year old is beautiful as well, but has gotten heavy in the last couple of years. They both go to the same school, and both are capable of straight a's. <br>  Everyone wants to be friends with the 14 year old; the 12 year old gets teased, picked on, insulted, and used by her "friends". Her grades are slipping, and she doesn't like school anymore. <br>  I wish I had an answer instead of empathy.|`|avrzuL8raa	Because there are so man shallow minded people that cant get to someones personality by going off looks first....that is really sad as i consider myself an ugly girl and dudes dont wanna look at me for looks then i will drop him like yesterdays garbage!!|`|lELMPtG5aa	Society has led people to believe looks are everything. Look at how sucessful the plastic-surgery industry has become. Celebs are (mostly) pretty and people flock to them. Seems to me everyone just wants to be around pretty people.|`|qp7SRGrcaa	people are shallow,and fake! they pretend for the most part just to get what they want from you! but not all people are bad! you just have to be able to tell the real people from the fakes!|`|tRQ8zUZ9aa	Because they want to use you and they know "ugly" people have more brains than "beautiful" people and know they wouldn't get away with using those people so they just treat them like crap and use people who are what you call "beautiful".|`|yBAw40hnaa	its the same way if you have money, you are than treated like your smarter, better, more liked.

You have the play the part of the good student, and really be interested in learning whatever he is teaching you .. obviously you laugh at all of his jokes and twinkle at the right times.

AyRL8nPhaa	If it is legal in your state, fine, but a relationship should be based on mutual respect and trust.Yours sounds like it is based on lust and the relationship will crash-he will never leave his wife for you.Most older guys love the bodies of younger women whether we admit it or not.Once in an office where I worked, my 15 year old sister came by to see me.I was 19 at the time.There were four guys-2 in their late 30's and 2 in their early 40s there.She was sitting in the waiting room.They did not know she was my sister.They started talking about what they wanted to do to her if they could get her naked and alone.One guy turned to me  and said "Wouldn't  you like to get her alone and get your hands all over that young thing and do (used very explicit term) her royally?". I grabbed the jerk, lifting him off the floor and growled, "She is my sister." Needless to say, their conversations ended.No, I did not hurt him, but he did get frightened.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	It's not so much the age as the "married" that makes me say you should stay away from this one.   There are older men out there who don't have wives, some of whom I'm sure would date an 18 year old.  Why even waste your time on a relationship that can only be a dirty little secret when you could have the whole enchilada with someone else?|`|bzfXbM4raa	I think there might be a slight social taboo in some places.  But I think it's quite natural for a women to be attracted to older men.  Men are genetically predisposed to find a young women to bear his children...women are predisponsed to find a man who can take care and provide for the children...and an older men is more likely to be able to provide this.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	YOU ARE IN TROUBLE SO LATE IN LIFE. Ask his wife, she signed the same CONTRACTas he.  What goes around will come around if you ever become a wife          I am guy telling you.|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Meh, I looked at women in their 30's and even 40's back when I was 18.|`|XHTTg3sZaa	No nowadays older men and younger women are a common thing. No not a creep just interested. You are young and not into most games women play  today and he was probably interested in that. I would not worry about it. <br>  Just go slow and you might find out that there are more things in common. Maybe you are smart, intelligent, have a plan for your future and he is interested in you because of that.|`|XqfH76PMaa	It isn't wrong for a younger girl to be attracted to an older man.  It happens all the time.  My sister is 28 and is with a 55 year old man.  The problem is his marriage.  You do not want to go there no matter how old he is.  You are just asking for pain and trouble if you do.  Not to mention, that would be so wrong to do to the wife.  As long as the wife is around, do not act on any of your feelings.  It is okay to have a secret crush, but nothing more.  If the marriage ends, go for it.  But not until then.|`|EFzdJ0rMaa	no i think its wrong for a gil to be attracted to a yonger man tho ! guys tend to like youngers girls n e way !|`|YfAh2qTCaa	your sick in the head!!!!!!!!!!<br>  jk age is only a number and the higher it gets the more your likely to die thats it...|`|j8bSJzSbaa	I was 16 he was 24....Its not wrong, we got married and were together for 6 yrs with 2 kids. But you messing around with a married man...I have no respect for you!!! Think of it this way ... what if that married woman was you and your husband was cheating on you with a younger woman!? Thats dirty!! Its called being a home wrecker!! Thats what happened to my marriage! Maybe you should stop and think!! As for him...he probably dont care how old you are...you are over 18 there for he cant get into trouble by law... You are probably just another young girl for him to mess around on his wife with!
anj5lQc5aa	Shaved or not is one aspect of this behavior.  I'm assuming you didn't ask about his preference in the presence of deodorant or not (assuming that deodorant is non-toxic...I've never looked).|`|DBjrKaBPaa	I'm no women but I don't know of any men who would do that, even my two co-workers said they wouldn't do that.  Its probably some fetish he has, I'd stay away unless you'd like him to do that to you.  lol|`|SYOcp4nWaa	disgusting|`|7OCrraCpaa	Yuck..<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|OfBTAX8raa	Under your arms is an errongonis zone.

Does whan them shaven or unshaven and does he like them sweaty??  Yuck, that is nasty!|`|bf86bfb2c4e8819b403411fcc6bd0da6aa	Ha ha ha ha ha - that is just the strangest thing I have ever heard of and although I am male I wanted to answer this question.  Whoever that guy was has some serious issues - however having said that I suppose it is just the same as licking your vagina .... in a way - except in most women I suppose the armpit is not an erogenous zone!|`|4L3JUzvuaa	Personally I don't find that at all attractive...but each to their own...|`|AA11449954	no i dont cuz i have a thing that i hate and i had some problems under there plus im very ticklish|`|TQOCOIH7aa	ewww|`|WuNqb0Nkaa	I'm not a woman, but, -- the armpit is a VERY WELL KNOWN erogenous zone for both men and women.  This is the reason it's so ticklish and sensitive.  Just type the phrase "armpit erogenous zone" into your search engine; you'll get thousands of hits.<br>  While the idea of licking an armpit that is sweaty may seem somewhat foul, you can always take a good shower before the pit-action.  <br>  hope this helps|`|uGA7g8Aeaa	It seems a little strange to me, but I have got to the age that nothing surprises me much anymore.  As long as everyone involved is having a great time, and enjoying the action, then more power to them.  Enjoyed your question.

The best way to tell them is by sitting down with them one on one and explaining the situation.  Be sure to let them ask questions so they can understand fully.  If they really love you, they will stand by you mo matter what.|`|d85ooaHmaa	what is your disability?
rHoNdOq6aa	Awwww! How sweet!!! I wouldn't let things be & trust him, or be wary of him. I would be both! If you have trust issues, you need to learn to trust him over time. Still love him, but keep an ear open to hear if he's been fooling around with other woman. Who knows....you might hear some good things too! :) Hope this helps!|`|8dd0f8be373b84e9702f6ba716745ffaaa	I think you should trust yourself and your instincts.  I know we all have insecurities but that is something that you have to work on.  You have to ask yourself if you like how you feel in the relationship-if the answer is no you owe it to yoruself to move on.|`|kwz9mceYaa	eh i think he should have hold on to the love word till he seriously knew it was true. ask straight up if he would cheat on you and stuff. i did and well it works. sad thing is i broke up with him jajajaja. sucks. go out with him see what happens. just dont get too too atached. you'll know the time when you can fully trust him. good luck love. <br>  peace&love|`|87CQJVa8aa	don't let your guard down. don't let him be the boss. take charge of your relationship. don't let him be friends with all of these girls. if he is hanging out with other girls thats just not acceptable. tell him you want to start hanging out more and more if he loves you so much. i'm with a guy that i thought was a player too but we've been together a year and a half and counting and thats the route i took to bettering our relationship.|`|9pCdReoyaa	Maybe you should talk to him about his past relationships and find out things like how long they lasted, why they ended and how many times has he been in real love or just said it w/ no real feelings. See were your relationship is going and what he thinks of you. For real not bullshit men say just to shut us up.and after you know all you need to know decide if your trust issues are wroth getting over or if you need to leave and find something different.|`|Wb5TTPp2aa	Just keep your guard up sweetie!!

qvEqSUANaa	28 to 50 because they generally know what they want and are much more fun to be with than young girls who have no idea who they are or what they want. Their bodies are still good if they look after themselves and you can hold good conversations, sex is so much better and lots of things really just more mature|`|Zi5JF9cNaa	35-45 because they are more mature, generally dont have small kids ( and dont want anymore) and understand that it takes a while to build a relationship unlike a young girl who wants everything right now.|`|8hFQJLOmaa	Date 18 and above.<br>  <br>  Marry, never<br>  <br>  I have too much fun being single.<br>  I answer to nobody but myself.|`|juRWvc0eaa	Well, I would think 25 to 35 for any consideration of marriage... I'd be willing to date younger than that, but only as a for fun fling. Any younger than that would need to PROVE they were mature enough to handle the relationship. Besides, after 30, guys have little or no interest in youngster drama.

iCnojcygaa	It sounds like she likes another guy. Keep the necklace and give her, her space. If she is ment to be she will come back. It is then up to you if she means this much to you. If she does this once she will do it again.|`|SxCqZMdDaa	First off, barrel racing is a very time consuming and competitive sport.  It doesn't end with the rodeo either. She has to spend hours grooming and caring for her horse, and if she has barrels set up at her house for practice, she has to maintain the grounds.  Let her do what she loves, it's good for a young girl to be passionate about her hobbies.  Tell her you want to stay friends, and you understand she doesn't have time for a Summer romance.  Offer to help her with the hard work involved in her sport, she will likely take all the help she can get.  Go watch her race, but bring along a group of friends to enjoy the show with you.  Hold off on the necklace.  If you end up back together, surprise her with it, but not right away. Wait for a holiday or her birthday.|`|d6Pv6CyKaa	Barrel racing? Hmmmm....strange...<br>  <br>  Anyway, forget about her, anyone who says they want to break up for the summer is only humouring you, in reality she is just too chicken to deal with the situation now and thinks this'll be an easy way to do it.<br>  <br>  Don't give her anything, just forget about her and move on. It takes time and it will be hard, but you'll get over it and you never know, chances are someone better could come along in the meantime.<br>  <br>  Don't waste another minute of your time on this girl, just concentrate on sorting yourself out. Some day you'll wonder why you ever cared at all.|`|0qKjXbdjaa	if she was really in love with you she would not have broken up with you. i understand how she wants to focus on other things, but why cant you be apart of it. if she has a lot on her mind she should be talking to you about it....i would keep the necklace for the time being cause if she loves you she'll come back and understand she missing out on something amazing|`|7ikz0Yd3aa	you should give it to her.. why not.. you do love her. your expressing your love to her. Dont question yourself... just follow your heart sweetie. If your heart wanted to buy that for her, then give it to her  without any doubt,  ; )<br>  if it was me i would definitely appreciate it no matter the circumstances|`|33387f0312b6f8eacc02d0ce050b7096aa	really, keep that necklace. if she dumped you, she is not worthy of your grateful gift.<br>  <br>  my opinion: get a new girlfriend, and get over it. that`s the best advice you`ll ever get. if you have difficulty with this, just browse this website <a href="http://www.informedman.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.informedman.com</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|wPcvdJEnaa	Keep it.<br>  By the way, you should ask her what the real reason for her breaking up with you was.<br>  (because obviously it wasn't barrel racing. Being with you has nothing to do with an activity)|`|osI82TXLaa	This sucks but why can't she be with you during the summer??? Has she ever broken  up with you in the summer only??  A relationship vs barrel racing...hmmmm  I say keep the necklace....How do you feel about it?|`|AkgDSb7yaa	sorry to hear this, try and keep yourself busy. sounds like she just needed little break, might not be the end for you two tho so try not to get too down. Keep hold of the necklace for now and see what happens - your still at school so you have plenty of time ahead of you. Know its hard at the moment but will get easier, just keep busy and you never know she may miss you and come back to you sooner than you think and if not someone else will one day. good luck|`|yDwmvusPaa	Since she has already stated that she needs time away from you to focus on other things I doubt giving her a necklace would change her mind. From what you said she seems to have made up her mind. You both need some time to reevaluate your relationship and the break up has provided you with just that.|`|j835RLyzaa	Keep it. Your girlfriend is obviously not serious about this relationship with you so if i were you, i would move on and start a fresh. Just take time out for yourself, you dont have to start another relationship until your ready. Or if you really really want this girl, then respect her choice and wait for her...but dont wait forever! - Follow your heart.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Sarah x<br>  P.S - Could somebody please take the time to answer the question / situation that i have posted? Its called 'A-Levels, GCSE's, Police Officer...and my aching brain!?'. Thanks x|`|TBjJt8ckaa	Let her have her space for now. As painful as it is, you should try not to have contact with her. If she really does want to get back with you next school year then let her initiate it. Keep the necklace until you find someone who loves you back.|`|QnPGkgiaaa	well it would be stupid and creepy to give it too her now. and you are the 1st person in the world to get dumped for barrel racing. she wants to date another guy, its not that hard to see|`|SSFYhhQIaa	Keep it. You need to forget about her and move on. It seems you want somthing serious and she doesnt. Let her focus on her "barrel racing?" :-/<br>  <br>  plenty of fish in the sea|`|29a107fb6ff5709555cee8637aed855baa	umm,,,so she wants to put you on "pause" for the summer...<br>  <br>  LOL tell her to get over herself...and then you get over her.<br>  <br>  GO for a walk and leave the neclace in a random persons mailbox.<br>  <br>  Move on!|`|7XlKSsW1aa	give it to her and tell her you had bought it for her before you broke up..... maybe she'll take you back|`|9TyjQpHvaa	see ..she gave barrel racing importance over you..try to find another gf or return it|`|P1H5fjDvaa	if you havent already gave it to her then keep it if she means that much to you then give it to her|`|bb2eKHtsaa	Just give it too her and try to hang out with her when she is "barrel racing".|`|RFUxGqCbaa	Give to her. Whats the point of holding on to it for the next year.|`|zHoBrYwiaa	Give it to her.<br>  <br>  It's just holding you back from moving on.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Stash it until you get back together.,that way you are prepared. As for IF you will actually get back..hmm..it can happen, I guess...but..well...this is not a new scenario my friend I am afraid.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	There's so much stuff to do during the summer, like taking a college class, or a  part time job. She has a life and so do you. <br>  I would keep the necklace, If you decide you want to date her when summer passes, then you can give it to her.|`|IQYrTfM7aa	keep it!<br>  <br>  Get over her, and cope with it.<br>  Start texting other girls, chilling with the guys for the next two months of summer.<br>  <br>  If by the time the next school year starts, you still want to go back out with her-go for it! If not, then nothing gained, nothing lost.|`|8CueBgEkaa	if she dumped you over somthing that small, then find someone else. i know you love her, but some times you have to let the one you love go.|`|tVkHQH5haa	is that a question???<br>  well i guess you have to have her happy, thats the whole point. if she isnt happy, then you shouldnt be in a relationship if its only half way.|`|6KJeBoGnaa	why would she break up with you for the summer?? thats stupid
SIo1g750aa	This is difficult, I understand that. But if you honestly let it go, you will feel better. Start worrying about other things: sports, school work, anything that will keep you away from her. You must commit yourself to it, it's the only way. Take up a new hobby. Saying it doesn't work, lets you continue to make excuses. It'll be rocky, but it doesn't mean you give up. Just think of her as the one who broke your heart, now she doesn't deserve it back.|`|hR0Bcox2aa	just tell her how you feel i bet she really loves you to just tel l her how you feel thats really the only way to get her to know that if that doesnt work e-mail me and ill help u through it it has totaly happend to me and is still happening to me and i dont know what to do eithier....|`|QSJDp6E2aa	lsn the same thing happened to me <br>  me and my ex boyfrnd broke up and he went out with my best frnd who knew how i felt about him, <br>  but ddnt care<br>  she wasnt a true frnd and ur frnd who is going out with her isnt either<br>  i went crazy and i told her and she seemed not to care<br>  but you know wut this qoute helped me gain my life back together<br>  "dont spend a tear on someone you wont spend it on you"<br>  so dont think that death is the answer. so just go out and see wut the world has to offer, cause she was a chapter in ur life and that chapter is gone.<br>  <br>  be happy the way you are and things will go great<br>  good luck <br>  hope i helped=D

If 5 years want long enough for him to see how wonderful you are, I dont think the fact that you slept with him will make him see it anymore. Bc. you gave yourself so quickly without even makign him chase you, he doesnt want it anymore. your vagina is like a  the diamond at the bottom of 40 feet of dirt. Men love the fact that they have seek the diamond (go through the chase) before they get that diamond. A diamond a man has had to search for 40 years is worth so much more than a diamond that he found just laying on his bed. You are NOT a **** by any means and I know you like him, but I advise you wear your sexist outfit tonight, hit up the town and flirt with a ton of men more attractive than this guy to get your mind off of it. He will never call you--and if he does, it will be only for sex and after a while, you will feel used. Bc. you made the realtionship all about sex fromt eh very beginnign (you did it without him being in a relationship with you) thats all it will ever be about. Unless you want to feel used and worthless, I advise letting him go now.  hun, cheer up. there is a  man willign to give you some type of committment before getting in your pants-wait for him to find you.

If him and his girlfriend breakup then go for it if not move on!
XJD1l5gJaa	From the way you describe it, it definitely sounds like you two have something--I'm not really the one to say if you should assume he likes you, but it sounds like its worth a shot. If your not comfortable asking him if he does, you can try to make it more apparent to him that you do, and maybe then he'll feel like he can be more open with you.|`|9A3rRl4Kaa	Of course he likes you!!! and you like him too!!!<br>  haha tell him that you like him and that you wanna go to a movie or something with him sometime. Trust me, he'll forget who the girl in California is. If he agrees to the date, be really flirty and stuff. If the date goes well tell him you had a good time and that you wanna do something again sometime.<br>  <br>  P.S. I live in Texas too!|`|C7yV0SXLaa	Tell him how you feel and see if he likes you to. If he tells you he loves you he must like you. Just try and talk to him.|`|56JwS7bsaa	It sounds like he is in love with you.. but a simple word can mean so much but he might not mean it. he can really like you though. If really likes you then he will ask you out. just be friends for now until he makes up his mind.  hope everything goes well!!!|`|2rUTU2csaa	You can't like him because he kind of has a girlfriend?? <br>  <br>  Welll...if you're talking that mych on the phone, then probably something is going on.|`|upd7W9ZUaa	He likes you.

jgP51MlRaa	If you want to be more hard to get, don't make him think he can get "some" easily... If he thinks that he'll just use you and move on.<br>  <br>  You have to respect yourself for him to respect you.<br>  <br>  Maj|`|kbdkOPHDaa	please take this slooow. this sounds like exactly what i was in (except i had already done some things with boys, i was still a virgin) and you start talkin to a guy and you really want him to like you....then it happens you lose your virginity to some guy you think is so cool and then you regret it because he is some loser that does this to every 15 year old girl you know.... trust me i know all about this.<br>  the best thing to do is hang out with him. if he likes you then he likes you, if he tries to get down your pants, state a obvious NO!!! say no all you want. if he still wants to hang out even though you said no, then he really must like you and will wait for you. if he never wants to see you again, then he was using you, and didnt get want he wanted anyways and you arent getting hurt. its the beauty of saying no! let him use someone else.<br>  keep your innocense as long as you can... wait for someone you truly love and are with for a while, that way you know you dont have the risk of pregnancy or stds.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|0jVPdT0caa	Aw!  Just be yourself and have fun with him.  You really don't have to act in an artificial way to get him to like you.

I wouldn't say all that. If you really love the person it's a moment thats only between you two that you won't feel for another because thats the person you love. Now thats some crap that happens in soaps. lol but I love my boyfriend and when we kiss it's just the moment that is between us I get butterflies and feel very special because I know he loves me too.|`|AA10245555	You loose all sinse of self as your body slowly floats into the air, and a white glowing light of love and trust surrounds you both.

ZWogx0k4aa	bros before hos?<br>  <br>  i don't know...that's not very nice of him|`|MXNcvwueaa	This is normal do not worry. When men and there friends are together they want to bond with each other and be equal. If he is hugging you etc it will make everyone uncomfortable. Also they will get the impression that he is displaying his ability to get the girls and make them feel small. So he ignores you to make everyone feel equal. Men are better at bonding than women i think they know how not to upset each other. What you should be pleased about is that he has introduced you to his  friends. Also although I am sure his friends like you very much on some unconscious level they are a little bit threatened by you because you influence your boyfriend more than they can now. they are also fond of your boyfriend as a friend and your boyfriend therefore does not want to show this imbalance physically through paying you attention.|`|luctZaCZaa	Because he's a jerk , screw him and move on , he doesn't deserve you ! One day you will find a guy that hold your hand infront of all his freinds  , that puts your picture in his wallet and shows it to everyone saying ; that's my girl = )|`|5nFzgcVYaa	this sounds dumb but we dont like showing our soft side in front of our friends|`|wPhAf3c9aa	he probably doesn't want to seem "whipped"<br>  or he just doesn't care for you enough.|`|LbqmPlHwaa	cuz he doesn't wanna look "soft" in front of his friends<br>  my boyfriend does it,  just not as bad<br>  and yeah it sucks.|`|egEZ4HbKaa	....Because their nuts are empty!|`|C2rPPVSYaa	He does not want to show his soft side to his friends.|`|OksQ2Rhgaa	Everyone acts differently around other people. Can you honestly say that you act the same around your parents, coworkers, teachers, friends, boy/girlfriend, and strangers?<br>  <br>  It's not just guys, honey.
YHp6o5QYaa	if you have any really good guy friends. they might secretly adore you, there is someone out in the world that loves you && you're THAT girl to them. you just have to be patient && wait for the ONE to come to you. && if you get into a relationship where you feel like your not the one and only then get out of it especially when they treat you like crap. you don't deserve that nobody does.|`|BQG15WsHaa	I sometimes wonder. I'm 18 and have never had a girlfriend. I don't think it's because of my looks but because I'm quiet. I'm to shy to make a move on a girl.
4Xkqo4q2aa	Go up to him and initiat a conversation. Ask him if he'd like to go somewhere with you. A lot of guys like it when a girl makes the first move. Not that I'm one of them.|`|84e08bd18ad63f2200ade1f52be3ca09aa	sound like innocent flirting (to me)|`|DebcHwWuaa	uhh idk thats tough..<br>  <br>  next time you see him you need to lik eask for his name and search him or something.<br>  <br>  but then again he could just be flirting i mean.if guys see a hot girl and they are driving they will point it out to them...so it could just eb that he thinks your hot and he doesn't want it to be anything more.|`|JK23ofg6aa	Do not start it may be he's just playing it happens many times.<br>  The next time he smiles at you do the same but always wait for his first step.<br>  Another thing.. don't over think, 2 or 3 smiles don't make a story.<br>  Good Luck|`|xM55i3Oeaa	u make the first move go talk 2 him!

However, I am glad to know that I am not the only one who is in this situation.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	I would not stay with a man who disrespected me.

Maybe he thinks he knows you from some place. As for being ugly, I kind of doubt he'd hold your eyes longer than the rest, then give you extra attention if he thought you was ugly. Ask him. It'll eat you up inside if you don't.

Make it a little obvious that you'd like to get to know her better. And if she says "no" or is not interested, take the hint. Women her age generally don't play with your head if they're not interested. If she's nice, it will be a polite refusal, and you don't get all in your head about it. If she says "yes," take her out like it's a date....because that's what it should be. |`|83b61a678eaf2af3827d3c08177f8a87aa	I feel your pain, I've been having milf fantasies myself.

I learnt my lesson, I hope you did too.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	when i first started reading this my sense is maybe that she broke it or really lost it<br>  <br>  but when you said you didn't know where she lived and you were considering taking something of hers...it added a new dimension to the story<br>  <br>  if this person is your 'best friend' then talk to them about it<br>  taking something of hers IF this is an accident isn't cool<br>  mistakes happen, figure out a way to solve this peacefully<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11664211	just tell her...ur going home? if she said yeah then tell her well that's nice i wanna go some where to do something around ur area so i will come along with u and get the iPod and i will do my stuff at ur area at the same time :) and give a smile ..but u gotta go along with her any ways |`|vijZ75rQaa	:/<br>  What a friend.<br>  Yup, take something from her and keep it hostage ;)|`|x0QN3LJraa	thats illegal.<br>  tell her u have the right to call the police.<br>  tell her parents. <br>  if she's ur best friend, if u no her phone number find her adress in the phone book, or search her parents on <a href="http://www.peoplelookup.com/people-search.html?searchform=name&&PHPSESSID=e0e90c3d195fa55ce828468a9739653d" rel="nofollow">http://www.peoplelookup.com/people-searc...</a><br>  <br>  good luck! :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: ______<br>  <br>  steal something from her and do the same thing she did to u.<br>  <br>  OR maybe shes saving it for ur birthday to remodel or something? doubt it but maybe<br>  <br>  or if she really is ur friend and she lost maybe shell ge a new one.<br>  <br>  NO tell her to buy a new one for you or youll tell her parents or police and make sure you go with her when she buys it so she doesnt steal someone elses|`|z6DCHxtAaa	well, you can follow her home secretly to catch her off guard. Or tell her you will report it stolen to the cops and then she will be arrested for theft, or call her home and let her parents know to remind her to bring your iPod so that you don't have to report it stolen.|`|NI2Vkm0waa	Offer her a ride home, and while you are there ask for it. Or call her in the morning before school to remind her to bring it, so she has no excuse not to bring it...|`|e45faa060bc5ff96ba594f5892747bf1aa	How can she be your best friend and you don't know where she lives? Follow the heffer home and ask her for the ipod back. If she still refuses, wait outside her home and call the cops.|`|8fcC5Dl8aa	call her house and when someone picks up as for her mom.<br>  then tell the mom.<br>  i would FLIP OUT if someone stole my ipod! ipod=life. music=life. music+ipod=life.<br>  so get it back!|`|EvWLKiTgaa	If you are a guy<br>  -she wants attention from you try being nice<br>  <br>  If you are a girl<br>  -Slap that hoe|`|FQK4jSk3aa	Call her mom.|`|y45TyWPYaa	Tell her that you'll give her a reward in $$$ but don't actually give it to her or contact her parents or yours|`|6WFIXIWfaa	Go to her house, by inviting yourself over, and make her eat a lot.  Maybe add some kind of laxative or something to make her be in the washroom for a while.  Search her house.  OR.  Do this yourself; bring a friend, and pretend that you have to go to the washroom, after eating something that upset your stomach, then search her house.  If this doesn't work, or you don't want to do this, have you considered just being honest with her and telling her that you want your iPod today?  Your idea was pretty good, as well.|`|AA10222199	you have her phone number right? well if its a house phone then you can simply google the number and you can get the address. if its a cell phone you can always call the cops and report it stolen and give them that number see if they can help you out.|`|rdXaf8lhaa	tell her that if you don't get ur ipod back u aren't going to talk to her. first ask for her number and tell her u'll call her so she'll remember to put it in her backpack and bring it to school|`|0rEco3yMaa	Don't kill her. I think you should take something of hers until you get your iPod back.|`|jdrYAewtaa	Report her thats a Fellini  |`|TRBaUoxDaa	Kill her.|`|P88369Araa	bring her to her house to get it when she says she forgot it|`|0o5L45dcaa	Order a hit out on her!|`|b4c54ca6b44dbb0a23f0ac38d1d72293aa	well you could beat her up she deserve it cause those things aren't cheap|`|Mm4S41Dsaa	Firstly realise that your friend must be struggling with some issues of her own if she has taken to petty forms of bullying such as blatantly refusing to give you back your i-pod.<br>  This friend may feel like she has no control in certain parts of her life, so she chooses to control other areas.. such as your friendship. Although she has taken a physical thing hostage (your i-pod) she may now feel that she has a hold on you too. You have to be careful when you deal with people like this and I suggest you take a different approach to the situation. <br>  Rather than taking something of hers, why not give her something more? Show her that you care about her, regardless of what insecurities she has. If you know her favorite food, eg. cookies, why not tell her you made the best batch the other day and give her some. Several hours later you could say something about the ipod such as "by the way am i ever going to see that ipod i lent you again? I just downloaded some awesome music that I want to put on, ill show you. but im starting to think its dropped off the face of this earth"<br>  Or maybe ask her over to your house for dinner or something and drop in a line like "oh and if you wouldnt mind bringing my ipod too"<br>  You know that you will get it back eventually so stay casual about the whole situation.<br>  If worse comes to worse, look her address up in a phone book and "when you are in the area - drop in to say hello" as you are leaving squeeze in the line, "i may as well get my ipod while im here ey"<br>  <br>

Maybe she should be apologising to you. As for the rest of it, don't sweat it, it'll pass. These things happen all the time at parties. As for your reputation, you aren;t a drinker, now your rep backs it up. no problem. I'd stay away from getting that smashed again, people who crash like you did will do it again next time they get as drunk. Know this about your self and don't get as drunk again.|`|RKHetTPYaa	All you can do is apologise and if they don't accept your apology then they can't have been real friends in the first place. Drink makes people do all sorts of weird out of character stuff and I'm sure that they know that and will calm down in time.|`|nOPSy8jTaa	you dont have to prove that your a nice person. as you said you were just drunk. they will understand. if they were still angry. dont worry it will pass. and besides you already apologize for what youve done. just continue on being good. and dont drink anymore.|`|shxqxr0Haa	bad choice of situations to pull a first major bender.  shouldn't have decided to get wasted for the first time in that situation.  don't know what to tell ya, i've kinda done the same thing.

Ever!|`|kbZ95TUZaa	People use drunkness as an execuse of a lot of things that they won't do. some people say that a person exposes the real truth only when they are drunk and who they really were. it was reckless stupid and iditoc for you to go on an ILLEGAL drinking binge. I want to get drunk so i am. You had no foresight or forethought to those types of behavior. 
PvvUUd5Raa	He's paying you a big compliment.<br>  <br>  If it was with someone who cares and asked the woman what she likes, I'm sure the girl would enjoy it.<br>  <br>  I think the best guide is how much vaginal juices wet the lady produces and also if her nipples are erect. That is an indication you are doing something right that can't be faked by the woman.She has to be aroused to do all of that.<br>  <br>  If a woman has had a painful previous experience, then they may carry this through to their next relationship, so yes, it is possible for a lady not to enjoy it. Sad to say some think it is still something 'dirty', which reflects the prejudices of the parents than any opinion the girls has formed by herself.|`|uvhq0MGpaa	Sure it`s a complement.<br>  I`m sure it is so much better for a guy if he knows you are being satisfied and its so much better for me if I am giving the same.<br>  There are all sorts of reasons why some girls don`t find pleasure or think that they should not.<br>  It sounds as if you are both happy with what you have found so Go for It!|`|154d5c65e8dc1963b1a27daaa55d0f83aa	some girls are fussy i dont like this or dont wantto try that, maybe your a women whos tries it for him  hopefully he does the same for you,keep the relationship strong, goodluck|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	i think what he is trying to say is he likes sex a lot and he knows you like it a lot too so its easier to say to someone who likes it, that you want it than to say he wants it if your not into sex that much. hope this helped :)|`|VygBNA0Waa	yes its true some men are very selfish and the women don't get to have a orgasm because the men don't want to put the time in they get to come and we get nothing so good on you keep him|`|OwSr2dtSaa	You both get each other aroused easily. You have climaxes & orgasm.|`|4YPeUE1Iaa	dont think you should worry,you both enjoy it so wheres the prob|`|wZtPX20Naa	I have been told this more often than not myself and there must be some unspoken body language that goes on when a man knows you are enjoying what you are doing.  I have been lucky enough to have had a few very intimate relationships that allowed for open discussion of our likes and dislikes and yes- a man can tell when you are enjoying him and not just shutting him up per say.  It is a huge turn on and if you are a person who has an imagination, you can find a lot of satisfaction in your relationship.|`|LqVycie1aa	I guess cos some women are the biggest DRAINERS on the planet, sex with them feels like rooting a mop. You might be open to things where other girls hes been with have made him feel like a fool or a failure cos he hasnt felt comfortable. Take it as a compliment, if you are being normal and he likes that, then its looking good for ya. Guys can obviously tell if a girl is bored cos they will just lie there with there eyes closed and make no movement to want more. It can be as simple as a girl holding her lover tight to squeezing his hands. |`|AA11175912	i think what he means is that its easy with you meaning you<br>  moan or get wet fast or something, therefore he doesn't have<br>  to try as hard to please you as he would another girl who does<br>  not get turned on as easily.|`|FyXy9Mobaa	If your relationship is that great then you should ask him what he means.....I think most women do enjoy sex unless its with a fat, oafish dog of a man who stinks of ale.|`|Kat0HjtIaa	he can probably tell from you expression during sex or what you say after. don't make it so complex, he said what he felt so what ever don't stress|`|Jy0l4bPgaa	its a compliment.<br>  he love you and loves having sex with you and is overjoyed that you enjoy it too! :]]|`|nOPSy8jTaa	he means its easy to have sex with you no questions ask. he he he<br>  he is not having problem on how to ask to have sex with you because he knows you enjoyed it too!|`|AupJUVIIaa	Lol! I'd have to agree with James on the fat, oafish dog of a man who stinks like ale part :P <br>  I think that he just means that it's easy for him to be a good lover with you because you enjoy sex...As in he doesn't have to try so hard to please, you already enjoy it one way or another. It would also make it easier for him to be good in bed, if he knows you're enjoying yourself. I know I'm may sound like I think you're a skank, but I don't :P I'm just being really straight forward :)|`|QZrXvWCiaa	well i think he means that if you weren't enjoying it, it would be more stressful for him, because generally i think guys really want to please a woman in bed. and yes i think there are quite alot of girls who don't enjoy sex, men have higher sex drives some woman actually really don't have much of a sex drive at all.
01b45bce27874111c843174e09bb7645aa	i liked this guy ALL summer long.  now, he's my boyfriend.<br>  i made it so i have 2 classes with him, and i'm just really confident and funny around him.  sit next to him, don't be shy.  i always paint my fingernails red.  he notices.  have long hair, guys think long hair is sexier.  blonde or brown is fine, but a lot of guys don't like red heads...  wear cool clothes, like i was at a party a couple weekends ago and this random guy was like i love your shirt, i love ed hardy.  guys like ed hardy, i don't know why, but wear ed hardy haha.  don't be TOO girly, but you have to be a girl.  like don't take too long to get ready, talk about how you basically dont have to do anything to yourself.  guys love natural girls.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|j8HmcjXfaa	Try to be active in school and stand out.  Be as popular as you can within your group of friends.  Hot guys will find you.  Guys don't like girls that try to hard to pursue them.

Guys like girls with a wel rounded personality. ( at least the well-rounded guys) You should know most of the things about yourself by now, like your hobbies and favorites, stuff like that. Girls that don't know who they are, are normally ignored.Don't be afraid to always show the real you to guys. And if they don't like it, ough. There are tons of guys out there who would like you, and not just nerds that have nothing better to do, but real true hearted guys. You just have to hunt them down. <br>   <br>  Also, remind yourself that  you have your whole life ahead of you to be kissed. Maybe you should just wait till the right moment, and be kissed by a guy you are totally in love with and he is crazy about you. Would you rather be kissed by a guy who likes you only cuase you look good? Or becasue you have a great personality?<br>  <br>  Just something to think about|`|bMo58LKeaa	Actually, being yourself DOES work in high school. Not for everyone all the time, of course, but a relationship built on you being somebody that you're not won't go anywhere and you certainly won't be happy.<br>  <br>  As you mature you'll learn that life is not about getting 'hot' boys to kiss you. You'll have a lot more fun in high school if you just focus on having fun and being yourself rather then forming superficial relationships.|`|7kWHf6kcaa	depends, are you hot?<br>  because if your not, lower your standards a little bit.<br>  <br>  why do you HAVE  to be with someone hot anyway?<br>  JEEZ! why is everyone so shallow now a days?|`|e73a599b3d16c3a69be3fdd95096c064aa	how old are you . well don't worry whether your not going to meet a guy tomorrow or not. because you might. it happens unexpectedly. i went to a club and hooked up with this guy then we were together but. he's wih someone else i really dont care 'cause there are more atractive guys out there that i knew and will know in the future. just try to make more guy friends hang out with your girlfriends be around a lot with your friends. and soon you'll be with someone. don't worry about that
Lh4zkYGkaa	u should prob be more flirtacious with him.  That way he gets a hint.  sometimes guys don't wanna do things that would make the girl uncomfortable, not that hugs do or anything (it's hard to explain lol).  once u start acting more flirty it might open him up.|`|FPnp2opzaa	talk to him.. is he uncomfortable with you? if you feel you both have nothing in common, things get way too boring then maybe he's just not the one for you.|`|YbGULYAwaa	Maybe he is just shy and doesn't really know how to act with girls.<br>  <br>  Have you tryed to make the move to give him a hug or to hold his hand it maybe worth a shot.<br>  <br>  Otherrwise talk to him and tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  What do you mean when you say boring??? As there other things to do together such as go to the movies, go out for tea, go to the beach etc<br>  <br>  I understand you would like some contact also.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If things dont get better after talking to him etc and your still feeling bored and not happy then maybe it is time to  break up.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|ELCM7TDKaa	after a month its still too son to really know the person. id say give him a little more time, but if you lose all interest, you have to tell him that and move on because you dont want to lead him on. but i'd definitely give him some time to maybe open up. maybe hes just shy|`|nOPSy8jTaa	tell him how you feel. and if you still like him and wants the relationship to go through then give time. give him time to think and for you to think. talk to him.
tXWCbPY7aa	He's bi-polar {insider} just bring up the situation and express to him how you feel. |`|vi4JlnJvaa	Sounds like he's using you if he's keeping you a semi-secret.  I think he's just not as into you as you are to him.  Find someone who is proud to have you on his arm and show you off, respect you, and walk the walk, not just talk the talk.  <br>  <br>  Your bf not introducing you to his friends is a huge red flag.  Good Luck!!|`|F4mgVTgzaa	hes a guy with a tough cover. My bf had sucha tough shield over him, took us 7 months to finally get close. . . we were both patient and agreed to take a chance, no matter how long it was and now were so happy. <br>  I think jus be patient, maybe you guys should fool around more, show him u really trust and like him.|`|nOPSy8jTaa	talk to him. tell him all your concerns.. thats the best thing you could do on my point of view. problems and worries get solved if you just know how to talk to him.  tell him what you want on your relationship and ask him what he wants on your relationship and listen!<br>  goodluck!|`|DH6GMCdfaa	Talk to him about it.

I have been with my g/f for 2 years and 1 month and I am the same way. not to say I've lost interrest but things just change. but I don't understand the parents thing. ask him maybe. or have you even tried talking to him about it? communication is they key!|`|cNQr4VKcaa	Well he doesn't have time to come around your house because I think that's when he's with his other girlfriend.

You don't have to rush into a relationship. Just give it some time. Maybe you will meet a nice girl in middle school or better yet, in high school. Don't treat dating like a trend. Too many people date just to say that they have. Being single is not a big deal. We're all just people. Some of us like to wait and find the right person. Other's treat relationships as though it were dispensable; meaningless. So my conclusion here, is just take your time and don't rush into a relationship. It's more special to wait until you're older and realize what you want in a relationship, whether long term or short term, etc. You don't have to have a girlfriend to be cool, either. Everyone will date eventually in their lives.

7zTMl2PBaa	I am sorry for your pain and hurt right now. I do understand how you feel, as I have had to suffer that kind of rejection with no explanation as well. My husband went through a time when he just did not want to give me any attention or affection, and our marriage had had its share of problems over the years long before then.<br>  <br>  If you feel there is something worth staying together for and you still have a love and desire to make it work, there is hope but it requires a change on your part, as there is nothing a woman can do to change a man from the outside. He must want to make his own changes within himself. There is way though, that we as women can help men begin to want to make these changes.<br>  <br>  Here is a really good article that might offer you some help and answers to your question, should you decided to make an attempt to keep your marriage together. I am not in any position to tell you that you should, but if this is where you want to place your efforts, I think you will find what is shared in this article, might really help you and your husband in the long run.<br>  <br>  My marriage is still far from perfect but finally over time, by me changing the only thing that could be changed within my power, my husband is becoming the most loving and tender hearted he ever has been. We work at our marriage as a real 'team' with both of us realizing our responsibilities towards one another. I wish you only the best on your search for happiness, whether it be with your husband or on your own, and your search for answers in life whatever they may be!   Peace.....River<br>  <br>  p.s. once you open the link, just scroll down to the one titled The Womans Roll in Maintaining a Good Relationship.|`|MOCBWQHhaa	He doesn't want to leave because he has the best of all worlds. He has his home, his family and all the comforts of a happy marriage. Plus he has his all the affairs he wants, even with your best friend. So his fantasies are being fulfilled. Now why would he give all that up.A divorce would mean he'd have to sell his home or move out, and he's have to pay alimony and child support. But you need to think of your own life.What are you getting out of it? What kind of example are you setting for your kids (if they are girls)?

A3UaBkzRaa	Maybe he's thinking you are fishing for compliments, since you say you have not gained weight but you mention your flabby abs. (Not that they are. I'm sure they're fine.) Hopefully he married you not just because you were prettier than his exes.|`|c8a188861f0a854648ff16ed2a2476a9aa	That reminds me of when I was young and stupid, I was at my married boyfriend's house and saw that he had bought his wife a dozen red roses. In other words, the compliments mean **NOTHING**. <br>  <br>  Do you need to be assured all the time about how great your "abs" are and how toned you are and how sexy you still are after your long, long marriage of three months? You better not pressure him to shower you with compliments, etc., because men can't stand to be told what to do or what to say.|`|90877616d47129b0c2c87f6d63b53f65aa	girl he's yours and you're his so there's no need to compliment all the time... you know how he feels already and he knows how he feels so that's all that matters.. if so happens he gives a good compliment then just be happy... it's nothing to worry about..<br>  women are always paranoid at what the hubby is thinking.. i tell ya .. you know he's hot for you if he's always all over you...|`|qL3dGTXDaa	He married you soley on appearances. Your relationship was weak and did not warrant marriage. The both of you just got caught up in the fantasy. Good intentions, but not solid enough. You guys better create something quick or so long.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	His actions speak louder than his words.|`|NqbBjS0raa	I am just conjecturing here so bare with me. It does sound like his reconsidering his opinions on you being hot. Or he is becoming complacent on his earlier assessments. Nothing a gal wants is to be taken for granted instead of being truly appreciated by a man. Then I think about his age and the answer is clearer to me that this generation is never satisfied or totally content on anything. So you are bucking another problem and it's not so easy. The male generation that is less expressive and waits thing out until you are not sure what the h*** they want or expect. It takes awhile to pull anything of formed words or ideas and it's a small wonder you got him to think about a complete thought leading to an answer for you to digest. lol Maybe you will have to extract some pain on him to obtain some emotions......|`|dHtJeqBiaa	my husband of three years we got married when we were both 19 i was getting ready to turn 20 he gets mad when i say i am fat or something bad about my self. u see your husband sees u are perfect when we dont. so now i just say how i wish i was in better shape and he will say u know if u do this it will help. i have had a kid with him of course. lost all of the weight and more but there are still parts of my body i hate but i try not to say that around him. i also drives me up the wall when he says he is hairy then a bear when he isnot and how he hates it and how could i like it. i say one he is very will groomed and two i dont mind it. he has dark skin so it is not as bad as other men i have seen at the beach with out a shirt on that needed one. i also tell him the same thing he tells me if i didnt like it that much i wouldnt ofmarried u. i could care less. at times i hate him for it cause he doesnt get bite by bugs cause of it when i go outside no matter how long or short i get covered with bites. also i would go get something to show off your body after loseing all of my weight i am slowy buying new clothes hubby loves it. and not all of them are for other people to see. he likes them alot. get u some and i am sure he will start again.|`|zHsmaWIjaa	Why do you still want to be compared to his exes when you two are married now? Did you ever think that maybe he just wants to focus on you two and forget about them? Stop fishing for compliments...what good is a compliment if you have to drag it out of someone? You know he thinks you're attractive, you're married....now it's just occasional compliments. When you keep asking for compliments, it makes people not want to compliment you.|`|ffb42367736232c58e1232280031062aaa	Thats a good question... maybe because he "has" you now he doesnt have to keep feeding you compliments or something? I have a fiance who compliments me every chance he gets.. and trust me--- I've seen his exes and OMG!!!! Im not 1 to think Im gorgeous but in all honestly---- I really am compared to the past ones..... ANyway.... I really hope he doesnt stop complimenting me after we get married.... <br>  I would ask him if he's lost interest in your looks now or something... |`|MpvD3kIgaa	ALL men do this. Its like once they win you over they do not feel the need to feed you with compliments, romance, etc anymore.<br>  <br>  No need to worry.

Listen, talk to your husband about everything, even your looks! Husband and wife should talk about themselves too and what they′re thinking and believing at this time, because we all change with time! It′s normal, and remember, you′ve fallen into a rutine, a different rutine you didn′t have before. You see each other every day, naked, with clothes, with half clothes, and your eyes get used to seeing the same person with the same good looking parts or not very good looking parts, ect. So maybe he won′t comment too much on your good looks because he′s used to seeing you, however, this is not a bad thing. But if you want more compliments, just tell him you miss that. Don′t expect him to realize this on his own, sometimes we all need a small reminder of what we used to do because it is normal to forget.<br>  |`|3nciTZ60aa	cuz he's got you and men are pigs. he don't need to work so hard now....so he thinks.

He taught me tricks, such as, get this, petting the lobster or crab, to get it to fall asleep before putting it in the water. It works, he calls it "humane," but, ummm, it still isn't that humane. I really don't like to do it. I mean, I love the results, but its like killing your pet chicken for dinner, it just rubs me the wrong way.

vaYJWYYfaa	I know how you feel man. I'm actually going through something similar but mine was 3 yrs. I think its hard getting completely over the person. Believe it or not as time goes by it gets easier not being with them. You still think about them every time but you get stronger with every passing day. It will be a colossal mistake if you get a new girl to replace the other one. That's not how love works. You have to heal yourself first before you can love another person. Take this opportunity to better yourself for the next person, hang out with your friends, talk about her, let it hurt, the pain will gradually reduce. But you cannot run away from the pain, that's what makes you stronger. Go to the gym, read about the world, do anything positive. Do not resolve to drinking or smoking cause that's the cowards way out. Chin up, smile, it hurts but it does get easier and it will.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	Another girl ought to do the trick.  |`|CMuaKItfaa	Is that you Joe?  I told you you should crap or get off the pot, but you wouldn't listen and now you are here asking how to get over me!  I hate so say it, but I TOLD YA SO!|`|qndKJUTLaa	Move on if you feel its in your best interest to not have to try and fix the relationship. Over time you will get over her. Yes, it will be very hard at first, having her in your thoughts all day, but trust me, only you know what is best for your situation. Remember the good times you had with her, and be glad you had the opportunity to have someone like that in your life. Not everyone gets that chance. Realize that there are many more girls out there and they are searching for someone who can make them feel complete. Let her go and move on. That is the best advice anyone can give you.|`|fYdLUdyjaa	well i have sort of the same problem except i date this guy for four years well what i found to help me was to just be nice to each other but give each other space. We stopped talking totally for two weeks and then came back and dicussed everything. Like how we felt and what we needed to do from then on and it helped me to talk it out with that person and tell them exactly what i needed and not feel bad about it. It sounds like you guys were serious so just give eachother romm and then when you feel like talking everything through take her aside and say everything that is on your mind.|`|601gOwNnaa	There's no easy way to do this.  You just need to try to keep you mind off her as much as possible and try to move on.  Time will heal wounds such as these.<br>  |`|ohGrLFVKaa	I'm going though the same issue right now (except my time scale was 3 years).  I started by getting rid of everything that reminded me of her, then I try to stay busy as much as possible so that I don't think of her.  Try not to contact her, even though you may want to, it will not lead to anywhere good- if she wants you back, she'll let you know herself.  I know it seems like the pain is terrible etc, it's been 2 months for me, and it is starting to get better.  Don't replay "what if" scenarios in your head, it will only drive you nuts.  Read "High Fidelity"- you don't want to act like the main character in that book ;).  Good luck man, it sucks, but it will get better!  |`|aUvhvqBfaa	you know, i had the same prob heres some choices:<br>  - get a new girl (i wouldnt though)<br>  - talk to her bout how you feel<br>  - follow your heart (best thing to do)|`|AA11175769	alcohol and find a better girl|`|YxF5I2TQaa	you dont.<br>  it just gets easier to handle my friend|`|oF2ddBImaa	consider her the 'one that got away' and move on my friend.|`|W10cK9XTaa	awe, try win her back??????? love will happen again xx
jxLWwMBXaa	You need him because you're 16 and not ready to be left with no parents. You need to realize these things happen. It may suck, but it happens to a lot of people. Many people are living without their parents and they find a way to deal with that. If you can't think of reasons you need your father, you don't really know why you need him and probably just want to save him from jail, but whatever he did that got him there, he needs to learn his lesson. It may hurt you, but he hurt someone else, too. Learn to take care of yourself. There are kids younger than you who have been forced to take care of their brothers and sisters because the parents died and no one wants them. These people will learn to live the life they have to lead. Just stay positive and things will be better in time. |`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Assuming he wasn't convicted of a voilent crime or charged with being an unfit parent he will not have to serve time so that he can take care of you.  I have also heard of arrangements where he could serve time while you were at school or something, and come home to take care of you in the evening.  There are also options where he could serve his time over weekends, but that would likely not help with your arrangement.  Maybe he could get house arrest time so he could still be there?  Just tell them that he is your father and that you need him at home, I'm sure things will turn out ok!|`|sowS7KW2aa	1st dump and forget ur ex boyfriend , he is evil, why he will wrote statement , he wants u to be alone and next time will get u whole , so be careful n take care of ur self ... i know u feel , so be strong to face life , ...  remember ... God is not sleeping ..... just pray for all of us .... and i will pray for u|`|AA12220949	One very important question.  Did your father have anything to do with the death of your mother?  If he did and that is the reason why he's going to jail, the courts will say that he's "unfit" to parent you (because of his checkered past).  <br>  What will happen is that he will be taken to jail.  First thing you want to do is find a family member (aunt, uncle, grandmother, etc.) and ask them to take you in.  Tell the judge that "Aunt so-and-so" wants to take you.  Then, Aunt so-and-so will fill out the necessary paperwork to become your legal guardian.  <br>  If you don't do this, you'll end up in a foster home.|`|qYjvuu3Zaa	Oh sweetheart..no matter what you always need your dad or your mom..if you can please explain why the police want to take your dad..maybe he hasn't made the best decisions..can you go to your grandparents or a close relative?

NWBmvICUaa	There is no time limit to things like this, you just do it when the time feels right. It could be a year or even 4 months. When you feel it inside and you think it will work. as long you are wanting to do it then you should. Even with kids as long as they both agree to it and are happy with it.<br>  <br>  I wish the best you the best of luck :) |`|LoP2CRE2aa	Well, are you planning on getting married some day? did you know that cohabitating increases the chances of divorce? Cohabitating is a huge decision, and especially when you have kids. If you bring this man into your home and into your kids' home, then hopefully you are pretty sure he is going to stick around for a good while.<br>  <br>  I live about 600 miles from my boyfriend. He will sonn be moving to my town to be close to me and pursue law school. We have talked about moving in but decided against it. Everyone is different though, and if you feel that it is the best situation for you, your boyfriend, and both of your kids, then go for it. Just make sure it is truly what you feel is best!

You will be his next victim. And it sound like he is a love them leave them guy.|`|TQuuDuhMaa	Then tell him that you don't think you guys are close enough to start kissing and stuff.  And if hes decent enough to understand that, then go ahead and keep going out with him.|`|qGTnACIHaa	ok...am 17 and my galfrnd is 13.so i know what u feel like.but i suggest if u wanna go out with such a playboy you have a desire for sex.get some guy who's more reliable.
GPWRhGyyaa	Guys tend to put up a brick wall when they get hurt.  It is the "macho" thing to do because they don't want anyone to think they arent tough.  If you explained it to him and he still acted that way, give him time.  He needs to be alone with his thoughts to reassess the situation. If he really cares about you, he will retreat and apologize for being a butthead.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you shouldn't let it bother you. Just go on like normal.  If it does turn out that he really feels this way, he wasn't worth it from the beginning and you are way better than that.|`|lObEjUh1aa	sounds like you both got burned; i would move on.<br>  <br>  if he thinks of sex as something you "owe him", how is he going to respond next time you have an argument?  even if you patch things up with him, he's still going to treat sex as a transaction, which should be a dead giveaway that a healthy, happy relationship is not coming out of this.<br>  <br>  time to move on, even though it's not easy.  good luck to you.|`|AdoY6wKZaa	I wouldn't have stood there and listened to his insults. He must be a real crazy dude. Be glad you don't have to bother with him anymore. He was nuts about you, and whatever the misunderstanding was, he chose that to go ballistics. Do not stand there and take insults from anyone! Yes, drop it, move on. Take time to be without a boyfriend and recover. Go places with girlfriends. |`|XU1fftrMaa	You do the same. Except don't say so much hate full things like he did. Try to make him jealous or mad. If that dosen't work come straight out with it. If you have to yell it in his face. Lol, I think my ex hates me to. But I will never know because of the lack of confidence that I have. I need help with that too but, anyways, just try a different approach.|`|arMJy542aa	All hes doing is trying to make you feel like ****, and its workin clearly..I mean flirtin wiv ur mates infront of you is a DEAD give away. He wants to show you hes ok without you, and i bet you anything he will eventually make a move on you r start talkin to you again, if i were you id move on, throw it RYT back in his face!ha|`|pWVbQUqtaa	He's a loser. Have a good cry, let it all out and then go hang with your friends and have some fun. Maybe you just learned a lesson about what you don't want in a relationship,now go find something better.|`|Ef4NVxH7aa	Ask him if he really means what he says ,if he does then he was lyng 2u all the time you were together ,because if you love someone ,you won't treat them bad even if they dumped you. I tried doing the same to my girl when we broke up ,but I did it coz I was hurt ,but I couldn't act like I didn't care about her for long . When she came to apologize  I accepted and apologized for treating her like crap when she dumped me. So perhaps your ex just feels hurt ,give him time ,then try going to him to apologize ,buy him something even to show that you're truly sorry. Sometimes us guys are just stubborn but love for our ladies melts our heart ,thats why we keep going back to our ladies. Gudluck!|`|AA12086491	Things like this happen, you hurt him, he doesn't like that, so he wants to move on from you.  First off, leave him alone.  Either get over him or be content to sit back and wait a few weeks until he's cooled off.  Then if you want him to really know what happened, try writing him a letter to explain what happened, be extremely honest.  Give him the letter with no expectations of you, just let him know you want him to know the truth, but your not trying to get him back.  If nothing comes of that then you really have to get over him and move on.  |`|5NKa5Y8laa	He is angry and hurting, and so he wants you to hurt too.  Give him some time and space to cool down, and then maybe try to talk to him and resolve any bad feelings so you can still be friends, if thats what you want.
hu44btbFaa	well it always seems like that when people ask these questions all the answers are what the asker wants to hear, which is "he likes you"<br>  <br>  i'm not him, so i can't know one way or another if he definitely likes you, but it seems like that he does like you.|`|W3F7xeF5aa	I think he likes you but first look how he treats other girls as well, if he treats hem the same as you then he's just a flirt and you'll just be friends. If he only whispers and puts his arm around you then he likes you|`|1LEuMJ2kaa	well if i was him, i might not be sure about my real feelings for u. a tip for u, if u wanna be with him, be more intimate in ur relationship with him. if u dont want, just leave it be. :]|`|lObEjUh1aa	sounds like he does<br>  <br>  /shrug|`|qXkywBogaa	yea|`|dGMCebY6aa	He probably does like you. Just simply tell him how you feel about him. Ask him if he does like you. If he says yes, ask him if he wants to move to the next level and start dating. Trust me, this will work. Good luck =)|`|8TSqoRDxaa	Coming from a male yes he does. I will give you the easiest hint. Next time he goes to whisper something close in your ear pull away. Look for the reaction that you get. Also if you do like play your own game with him. It doesn't matter how many other friends that he has that are girls as male if what you have said is true then he defiantly likes you. good luck to you. I had an awesome relationship with one of my Friends that lasted for 5yrs. |`|0oF6yFmPaa	Yes I think he likes you.

f6qmRicQaa	You have the reception you always wanted and tell everyone to come.  It is your day, and you can't plan this event around the needs of others.  Tell your hubby that you respect his parents beliefs but at the same time they must respect yours, if you cave in to them now you will be doing it for the rest of your married life.  |`|mvKDbb2uaa	Go and have the wedding that YOU want...not the wedding that your respective families want.  At the end of the day, it's not about them but about you and your fiance.<br>  <br>  You have to realize that you won't make everyone happy--family or friends.  Be up-front about it all and plan what you'd like.  Sit with your fiance and decide the kind of wedding that you BOTH want and plan that.  Regardless of what you plan, both families will be there.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	sweetie it is not all about his family - there has to be some compromises made here - and he needs to know that you get an equal say in everything about your lives.<br>  i think another poster mentioned this already but it is the ideal solution - have an early wedding.  either late morning or early afternoon.  then you can have champagne and orange juice set up for your toast - those who drink can have the mix those that don't can have straight orange juice!  <br>  if you have to have an evening wedding then what if you had a reception dinner for everyone.  make sure the venue has both wine and sparkling juices on hand so that everyone can have a glass of bubbly to toast the happy couple.  <br>  after the dinner and speeches you two have your first dance, then the dance with the parents etc. and the reception begins.  i would allow up to an hour without the bar being open out of respect for those who do not drink but then i would have the bar open for those that do. <br>  that gives the non-drinkers time to visit and enjoy themselves but you can not deny your family their fun and your man needs to understand that.  <br>  i wouldn't hide the liquor that makes it look as though you are doing something wrong and you aren't. <br>  i hate to say this but sweetie if he doesn't then you better take a closer look at who you are marrying - if he is controlling now what the heck will it be like as time passes?  <br>  good luck and happy wedding!|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Ive never understood why drinking is a sin. And I dont understand why alcohol is a must have at a wedding. Shame on both your families for making such ridiculous demands.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would invite them to a simple dinner afterwards, and treat yourselves to an amazing honeymoon! Why spend the money on a reception if they are going to complain about it, no matter what you do? Its your money; live it up on the honeymoon!|`|AA11380378	Have an sparkling cider toast instead. Have a dry reception with dancing. Tell you family that they can drink before the wedding. people can dance without drinking. <br>  <br>  then host an after party and have fun with those that would like to have a drink with you.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck|`|NMcFF0Iwaa	Have a sit down dinner after the wedding, then choose another place to have the drinks & dancing.  Add it to your wedding cards, then all will know what & which they want to attend.  And they can RSP you such.|`|AA11603468	I don't know whether this will work, but how about having the wedding, followed by a meal, and then a party afterwards. His family can attend the wedding and meal, then leave before the party starts, and those who wish to remain for the party can do that. <br>  <br>  His family can celebrate with you in their way, and yours can celebrate in theirs. His family doesn't need to be present for the parts they disagree with, while yorus can have the kind of fun they are accustomed to.<br>  <br>  I know that while we aren't lushes, our family wouldn't go for a wedding without any kind of alcohol. |`|mkrKHQvFaa	Ok, I have heard of this one before.  Have your champagne/apple cider toast.  I know it is hard to not offend anyone but you have to remember this is YOUR wedding.  If they are devastated over a Champagne toast then they are being too judgmental.  If you are planning on having a reception at a hotel they can go get their own alcohol at the bar....thus you are out of the loop.<br>  <br>  Good luck. |`|AA11119076	How about a morning wedding?  No drinking would be expected at that; you could toast with sparkling water or a Mimosa for you and hubby and OJ for everyone else (they look the same so nobody would ever know).  I feel your pain, these are going to be your in-laws so you don't want to start off on the wrong foot but you want everyone else to have fun too.  Have a morning wedding and small reception, take an afternoon break and invite the partiers back for dancing and drinks in the evening.  |`|JJUZFvggaa	Well this is just and idea on how to make each guest happy but you get what you want at the same time!  I personally think each guest should respect you for what you want and not say a thing but we all know that never happens!<br>  <br>  Have your ceremony around 2-3 maybe even 4 and have snacks to follow at your ceremony location for both families. Then rent a hall for having fun with friends and your family more of a reception. Then the snacks were more like your "co-tail hour" and you still have a reception which will be smaller and more Intimate which you can have a sit down meal or just a few more heavy snacks! .<br>  <br>  How you do this is on the bottom of your invite say " snacks and  apple cider toast to follow immediately at the church"<br>  <br>  Then you add a small card that says, y" We wil be have a small gathering at .......... with dancing drinks and munchies" <br>  <br>  Of course you can find a better way of wording it and only put the cards in friends and your family's invites! Then every one can join in the toast and you can still have your reception with no worries! Just make sure you have different RSVP cards for each family. One for wedding and snacks. The other for wedding, snacks and your reception hall!|`|RyjMNUKcaa	Well... you are in a tight spot. No matter what you do someone will be ticked off.  You stated above that you wanted the traditional champagne toast and you should have it but have no other liquor as a compromise.  This might be easier to pull off if you are having an afternoon wedding with the reception right after(like 2 or 3) sort of a garden party style.   |`|fC1pKlLHaa	I know this must be hard - you dont want to speak badly to your Fiancee about his FAMILY. And if this isnt handled appropriately, it could start a feud that could go on for years - over champagne. <br>  <br>  It shouldnt be : no champagne, or NO reception. That is a very extreme stance on the situation.  NO reception insults what you want, and your dreams of how you want your wedding day to go. <br>  <br>  You could do a large wedding, a quick dinner, and then run - dont walk - to your honeymoon - but is that what you want? Probably not. <br>  <br>  You and your fiancee need to really sit down, and look at whats important to BOTH of you. And where a compromise can be made. There are very religious members of my fiancee's family who will be attending the religious part - but will not be attending the reception because there will be alcohol served there. If that includes certain members of his family - then so be it. <br>  <br>  Or you could toast with non-alcoholic drinks for the non-drinkers, and let people who want to drink (yourself included :) hehe) drink what they wish. Just dont serve the alcohol openly. Have a bottle at your table, but let all the other guests go to a  designated bar/area for instance, and grab their own glass of champagne. That way there's no pressure on the guests who dont drink.<br>  <br>  I think its an extreme view, to completely forbid a reception, just because there will be alcohol served there. If they do not want to drink, they have 2 choices: show up, and show some respect without drinking or pushing thier beliefs on anyone else, or they can politely not attend, if thats how they feel.|`|fwCR1i3Kaa	Don't not have a reception just because of your in-laws. Talk to them and ask if they are okay with just a wine & champagne wedding. That way your family can still toast, and his family will have apple cider or whatever they want. If that is their beliefs then fine but they shouldn't look down their noses at your family for having a drink or two.  <br>  Have your reception and have it yours and your fiances' way.... this is your guys' day and if someone is dead set against it then they are selfish and won't come. You would go to one of their dry weddings because you are there to support the bride and groom. Not to get trashed on booze or not.<br>  Good luck and have fun!<br>  Congrats!!|`|lObEjUh1aa	Why not have a separate reception (on another day) just for your family?<br>  <br>  ps -- contrary to other posters, I recommend against viewing this issue unilaterally.  it is your day, but it will be a happier day if you find a compromise.  if you end up forced into an ultimatum (either with his family or yours), make sure that ultimatum is a decision you and your fiancee make together.  credit his needs and feelings and he will credit yours.  marriages require compromise to succeed, and if you view this issue (or any issue) as 100% non-negotiable, you'll end up frustrated and miserable.  i do wish you the best and hope this helps.  good luck!|`|nIs3Nrmfaa	How's this........run away and get married and celebrate your love for each other the way you want.  That's what I'd do<br>  <br>  Ok if you don't like that answer, how's this.  It's not your problem.  If your two families can't figure this out together and have a good time then I guess this will be the only time they'll be hangin out together won't it. <br>  <br>  Anyway, congratulations on your wedding and it sounds like its going to be fun..........have fun and don't worry about those old crusty souls that think that everything is a sin, even having some fun.  |`|xTzz7wORaa	babe...its your wedding...not theirs!!!!!!!!! they can suck it up...!<br>  <br>  let ur hubby know you want to have some wine and good time..after all..its ur day!<br>  <br>  but at the same time u and hubby are going to have to agree..so why not let ur family know there will not be alot of drinking just a lil...maybe to bring their own or something...????????????<br>  <br>  i had a similar problem with my wedding. the wife's family is very dysfunctional and my family actually like each other and are religious..((me and the wife are not)) so...it all worked out though...after 2 hours the whole thing was over!

It depends on what she likes.|`|w6r4U7duaa	tell her in detail, like ur actually doing it, you got to have a vivid imagination for this tell her shes sooo hot lol|`|0DpCPsiNaa	you know her better than us especially if she is your ex you should have a pretty good idea of what buttons to push|`|7kJB91Fmaa	Tell her that you want to get her into a jacuzzi and that you want to slowly kiss her neck and move down to her breast and slowly inserting your finger inside her vagginna!|`|vz6vZeAYaa	Your A Mound of Diseased hyienasence not fit to even LICK THE dirt from MY SPATS!|`|ZyNslK8iaa	You probably shouldn't say 'up the butt'.|`|LvsuzVyuaa	tell her u'd massage her w/rubbing oil that heats up when u blow on it...i no thats what turns me on ;-)
SnpUpZw5aa	The first step is to decide what you want and to define your purpose. When you create intent suddenly all your interactions have a lot more meaning. I suggest you have an end goal in mind, it might be inviting all the women you meet each week or each month to a party or event of some kind (it doesn't matter how big or small).<br>  <br>  Then comes the next step, that helps trigger attraction. You want to create social proof. Social proof basically means the social cues that people give each other determine the way people act. So for example if you have several attractive women around you then it is going to make a new woman think it's acceptable to be seen around you and ultimately sleep with you.<br>  <br>  Why is this so important? Because women are hit on by guys all the time so they often look for guys that other women already find attractive. They know that if other women are around the guy then they are more likely to be attractive to women and thus seem like a more attractive choice for them to partner with. This is one of the main strategies most women use to short list who they are going to partner with.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  Dave Taylor<br>  <br>  I was desperate for Gas Money and Found a Free $250 Gas Card<br>  online.

Go up to the "hottest" girl in your class, or maybe even a girl a year older, and say, "Hey, I think your gorgeous," and walk away.  All the other girls around her will pick up on what you said and how confident you are.  Gossip goes around, and then...who knows.  <br>  <br>  Also, take care of yourself--dress well (not like a schmuck), take showers everyday, wear deodorant.

Being short gives us something in common, haha.<br>  <br>  I don't think height has a lot to do with a guy's whole "protective feeling" thing, in my opinion.

I've dated a few boys (granted i was about 12) who were shorty than me. My bf now is 6ft 3in tall and that's a whole 1ft 1in taller than i am. Boys who are shorter and date short girls don't get backache.<br>  <br>  I don't really care about height, i love my bf for his personality, (his eyes and his ears, i love too). |`|EUwfmlHpaa	im 5'2" and dont care about height, to be honest - does it make a difference?

I'm 5ft so you're ideal haha ;)|`|5j5xKHMfaa	I think short boys are cute, im only 14 but i have been in love with someone shorter than me. Its not about hight, age, ect.<br>  Its about personality and love.<br>  girls love boys if they are protective. 
LXPMsKxxaa	Haha- I'm dating a shy guy. Its kinda cool getting the insider's perspective- wondering if the guy I'm dating feels that way about me. <br>  <br>  Make an effort to talk to her. She might like you to! Go for it and see what happens! You never know until you try, and if it doesn't work out, I promise you'll live to see another day. Dating is fun.<br>  <br>  Also, don't worry so much about the looks. My guy for example, is a little on the skinny side. And I happen to be chubby. I really don't care though, because nobody's body is perfect, and he has a lot going for him: he's cute, he's smart, nice, talented, etc. I do as well- good personality, good sense of humor, etc. There is no reason why you shouldn't have confidence, boy: focus on your positive attributes rather than your negative ones! The right person will like you for whatever you are- fat, skinny, ugly, pretty- what have you. If she can't see past your chub, that's her loss. |`|ooBONTgYaa	I am in the same situation but flipped around.

Because girls normally are afraid to make the first move, the guys have to.<br>  <br>  Just go for it! Because if you don't.... the girl could end up like me, waiting for him to make the first move.. totally crazy about him... but it never works out. Or maybe it will.<br>  <br>  YOU CAN DO IT!!! <br>  <br>  GO FOR IT!|`|bCpHtVxXaa	become her friend first. and since she stares at u there's a good chance she might like u, or she just notices that u are staring at her. but some girls like chubby guys. so just be urself and if she doesn't like u back then she's not worth it. ask her out once u become good friends :)|`|65Ow84SWaa	Take things slow and be cool.

Good luck.|`|PsWHj28baa	Just take a chance, get her at lunch time or something. Say "Hey, can i talk to you for a sec? Then ask if she would like to do something sometime.

7cDMRzomaa	Goodness gracias, I would never cheat on my boyfriend... ever. There is not one situation in which cheating is an any way acceptable. If you would cheat on someone, even if it's just once, then you don't deserve to be with them and they should find someone way better. I wouldnt want to be cheated on so that's why I wouldnt do that to someone else. Whether or not you get caught is not the issue, the issue is whether or not you really want to be with the person that you are with.

The fear of being left, not "really" being loved, proving ones manhood or womanhood.

1B5p1Iyeaa	It seems like it's all psychological with you.  You're with him all the time and you like him, yet the whole ordeal of  him being titled as your BF is uncomfortable for you.  I think you're giving it too much thought.  What you have with him is exactly what a BF is.  You just don't want to admit it.|`|AA12389198	I wouldn't. You've already been down that road once, and it didn't feel right. You need to tell the boy that you like him a lot as a best friend, because that's what it sounds like. I think when you two date it puts too much pressure on your relationship. |`|t4ebT9araa	well, you say you like him.<br>  so say yes.<br>  and if you don't like the way it's going,<br>  break up with him.<br>  it's that simple.|`|yH3m4NI9aa	you should go out with him, it's the obvious thing to do. you like him, he likes you. dance. see?<br>  but don't change just because he wishes you weren't as green.<br>  besides, as long as you aren't over obsessive about being "green" it probably won't matter to him.|`|tmTcZBjZaa	I thinky ou should go for it, because one day hes going to give up because he's asked you that many times. :) hoe  helps|`|bCpHtVxXaa	this poor guy has been chasing you every where! give him a break and go out w/ him! i mean if u go out w/ him it's just gonna be the same way that it is now. but i know what you mean that it felt wrong...cuz i had the same thing. but really it's just cuz i was affraid to date someone. so just go for it..after about a week you'll get used to dating him. so i really think you need to give it another shot.|`|K0VZSYO0aa	well maybe your afraid of commendment and don't care for relationships if not maybe deep down you don't like him just his company and if that's it try to build a friendship with the worse thing is to lead him on if you like him go out with him after the dance and if it still feels weird stick it out for a couple of days and get used to the relationship|`|wpEH8Tzkaa	Look, the reason it felt weird was because you didn't know what to do or what move to make.

She doesn't deserve you. My man is 6'4'' and I am 5'6'' and it's all good. I doubt you guys would look like towers together. that's a ridiculous reason to break up with someone. If she'd dump you for that, think of all the other dumbass reasons she'd dump you.|`|Iws6kykqaa	It's YOUR relationship, not other people's.<br>  Those people who are making fun of you are not going to matter 5 years down the road.. You probably won't even remember you..<br>  <br>  I think you guys would look great together.<br>  Personally, I think it'd look kind of weird for a 5'5" girl dating a 6'4" guy like you. THAT'S when it looks weird because she'll look so much smaller/younger than you. You two are around each other's height.<br>  Would it really make that big a different if you were like 5'8" and she was 5'1"? It's all the same.|`|N7UCCGDDaa	not to be rude or mean towards your girlfriend or anything because i don't know her. but she seems really insecure and REALLY shallow. and that's really sad. i mean if you ask me she doesn't really care about you that much and she doesn't deserve you. you honestly deserve better. i mean if i was dating a tall guy you i would love it and embrace it. what's so bad about being tall? seriously. but if you really care about her then i would just try to talk it out with her and try to make her feel more insecure with herself. tell her that it doesn't matter what other people say or think. tell her that you like her for who she is and that you'll always be there for her no matter what. but if she continues to act like this then i would do yourself a favor and break it off with her....... but i really do hope it works out:) good luck!!|`|zLzwaCpcaa	I think that dumping someone because of their height is ridiculous. I don't think that height should be an issue when it comes to dating. It shouldn't matter how much of a difference in height there is, as long as the relationship is strong, that's all that should matter. Other people's comments may be harsh, but you shouldn't let that get to you and your girlfriend. I suggest talking to her and just tell her your honest opinion and work this out. If she's still stuck on this whole height issue, maybe she's too insecure for you. |`|XBX2oPcoaa	That is stupid if you guys love each other or your attracted to each other your height shouldn't matter,<br>  Im sorry but i think that is stupid you shouldn't just break up with someone she obviously dosn't like you or love if se is going o break up with you over something so Dumb??<br>  It dosn't make sense? But im sorry! |`|7FCp1CMvaa	umm.....5' 10" is tall for a girl lol.......unless you mean 5' 1"...then that's short. <br>  <br>  but if she's dumping you b/c of your height...better let her dump you....do you really want to be with a person just because she/he focuses on small things like this? <br>  <br>  let her let go of you. |`|5OGBneHLaa	She would be shallow and allow other people to influence her feelings.<br>  <br>  My husband is the shortest man I have dated. He is 5'11 My bofriend before my husband was the same height as you and I am 5'5.<br>  <br>  Sounds like she isnt worth it if she does break up with you.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	then she's just immature and SHALLOW! common now..it's going to look like a freak show if you go out with a girl who is short! i think you guys (as in height wize) make a cute couple...my husbands 5"11 and i'm 5"9 and people are always saying we make a good /cute couple|`|T5LgCu5Qaa	That's so superficial! If she actually liked you, she'd stay with you! She doesn't sound worth it anyway if she'll break up because you're tall!|`|tcPLpvpXaa	You're only 6 inches taller than her.  That's like 6' and 5' 6".   l would say thats about the average difference.|`|nZhgSTtAaa	well thats crap i love tall guys she dont deserve you|`|bshEktNtaa	my husband is 6'2 and im 5'10, and who cares what you look like... all that matters is that you are together and she should see that. she should take you as you are cause that's who she fell in love with, thats being shallow...and if she cant accept you for you then maybe you should move on....why would you want to be with someone who doesnt love you for you...|`|bEhJTY8Naa	If someone is going to be this immature, you do not desirve her, she is a shallow low depth insecure person and you can OBVIOSLY do better.

Her age obviously shows.|`|s8B6kncTaa	Let her go if she has such issues about her height.. it has nothing to do with you. There are plenty of women who love tall dudes!!!! Beat her to the punch, do not sit and stress over it at all.  She needs to learn to laugh at herself and accept her height. Dont let it drag you down.|`|KIOv8U6gaa	What a stupid reason to break up with someone. I actually prefer guys who are tall. I think it's hot. But if she's willing to end the relationship with you because you're too tall then I'd say so long. She doesn't sound very mature anyway. |`|VlKGgL6Iaa	Her being insecure about her height is a red flag.  It will just lead to MORE insecurities.  Hook up with someone who loves and accepts themselves for what they are.<br>  Not only is she insecure, she is shallow.  Move on.|`|iIuBLrozaa	that makes NO sense.If she dated a guy that was less than like 6-2..SHE would look stupid.6-4 is slightly tall for a guy..but not weird by any means.She is the freak at 5-10 for a woman.|`|gtyQdCaAaa	Start hunching your back or get height reduction surgery. |`|wFzizI2faa	thats shallow. let her then. if she doesnt like you for you, then it'll never work out. 6 4 isnt even that tall.|`|TRzsmcquaa	make sure to bang her before the breakup|`|Z9MPBKrGaa	you guys should care what people say about you|`|OBX1pygSaa	buy her stilts|`|E5eZn9rcaa	That guy is a dick. You shouldn't listen a thing to what they say. Considering how I've seen a lot of couples in my town who are not hollywood perfect (in fact, it's always the big girls that get all the guys--they tell me they like their dates soft), and nobody taunts them or anything. Basically these people need to face the reality that there are tall people that exist not only in myth and they should just suck it up, obviously. <br>  However, if you think your girl is a little uneasy, just sit down with her and talk together about this. I see that you care about her by telling us about her insecurities about herself, so try to let her bring it out and discuss it with you, if necessary alone. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I'm sorry, but I am a little outraged how a little thing like height is treated by others in such an over-the-top way. When a lot of girls here in the uk are getting beer-bellies and painting themselves orange and vary from average to plump, yet are not self-concious at all and don't give a dang about what people say about their looks! I'm surprised people would beat your girl down by just being taller than others for her age.

pJEuPvYIaa	Yeah it's awkward when it happens like that. That's why I avoid hooking up with people I work with or in class with. But, cry! Cry it all out and just move on. It hurts and it sucks. But that's life. Cause if you do get him back he won't be the guy you want him to be cause he liked your friend. So I would suck it up and if you can be his freind but don't expect anything more.

Thick about it! |`|7tLDdtqGaa	he's playing games. he could be playing games Because he likes you or he could be playing games because he likes everybody.<br>  hard to tell.<br>  <br>  but i have told girls i liked someone else just to make them jealous before when they were the one i was really crazy about.|`|h8WRyU5Oaa	Be careful, You should know if he really loves you or he's just doing it for fun ,you can see it in his eyes.<br>  if he still likes you, just try to be polite with him and he will understand you for sure.<br>  But if he doesn't... it will be a waste of time.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	i think it's just playing around with your feelings, which means he doesn't really care about you! just try to forget him. and also the more you deny the feelings that you have for him, the harder it will become to get over him. admit and forget|`|PrdQZMfLaa	There are other fish in the sea don't let yourself get hurt twice even if you do like him he will do it again.|`|pYWVSrcwaa	maybe just go up to him and start talking, that's what i would do. or maybe smile at him or something to show that you forgive him. you could say sorry, but that might make it awkward to start a convorsation after. so just try to break the invisible barrier between you two. <br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  (thanks for answering my question!)|`|Ko77qkuyaa	oh my god! when i was reading that, i thought i was reading the story of my life.

If he trully likes you hed except it and want to get back into conversation just let him know how you feel and make sure u fully explain yourself . . . if he wont talk to u n gym just go up to him and start the converstation if he ignores you then just leave it alone until gym again because he cant stay madd forever and if he did think is he really the one i like<br>  <br>  BESTOFLUCK!|`|SBoyqiKraa	to be honest with you girl, don't say sorry to him. If he liked you he wouldnt have told you he liked your friend he must have said that in order to get your feelings going. If he wants to be good friends with you again, he'll come back to you. Don't force the situation, let it happen on its own. I'm sure he'll realize what a good friend he's missing.<br>  goood luck:)

If you get caught staring and the female never looks back after you make it obvious then forget about it unless you got serious game.<br>  <br>  To summarize, listen to your gut instinct. Make it obvious that you are checkin the girl out.

agPn1LyCaa	yah well you're kind of right in a way...i mean, when you first see a guy, one of the 1st things notice about him is his looks. his looks are the thing that attracts you to him. a lot of people date super hot guys and dont even notice that some are *** wholes. im not saying all hotties are *** wholes because that's not true at all. i think that being decent looking and you personality makes the perfect guy becuase he is able to treat you well and he's handsome at the same time. there's no doubt that the way a guy treats you is important but i agree with you that looks help. :)|`|084ca43a3959eb163fc61f1fc4f795dcaa	personality is more important because no one wants to live with  a horrible person. but looks are also important because physical attraction plays a big part in a relationship. its a package.|`|qsEirDDZaa	For a girl, a guy should be decent looking and be TOPS in personality.

I think people just want to believe that humans aren't animals and pick their life long mates based on something shared intellectually, spiritually, etc. And that no one really cares if someone is born ugly, because it isn't their fault and it doesn't make them a bad person. And someone being born looking gorgeous isn't God-like or worth getting to know just because they happened to get lucky and get good genes.<br>  It isn't true obviously. Only a few mature people think that way<br>  <br>  I'm not gonna lie, I have looked at guys and thought "omg he's hot" lol|`|rJuoPJ4qaa	Since like...forever for me.  I prefer to get to know someone before meeting them in person,  i have never met tater in person but we talk on the phone daily and I absolutely love him.  He is a wonderful man in spite of his current circumstance.   <br>  <br>  If we ever met and he did not look like his picture, yet he was still a man...cause I don't go the other way, I would still love his heart and his mind.  I hope to someday find a man who has his heart and mind but lives in my hometown.  If I could finally be with someone who is my best friend, confidant and  lover would be incredible!  Makes me teary just thinking about it.<br>  <br>  That would be the best Christmas gift I could ever receive!|`|iNHVaob5aa	I love having personality over looks.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend of three years is a little on the chubby side and is...well.. missing three teeth from an accident, but he treats me so lovingly and is the most caring person I know.

Once I got to know her and fell in love with who she was, there was no one else on earth that was as beautiful as her.|`|tGRedSI0aa	they are both important, but personality is more important because when u live with a person; you stop paying much attention on his/her shape as much as u pay attention to the way he/she treats you and the way he/she behaves. <br>  so, gradually personality is more important..|`|wvkM1DJ2aa	Sure, if you're superficial and care what other people think of you and your boyfriend, looks are more important.

What someone looks like should never be more important then whats on the inside. I am not saying looks are not important because they do play a very big role it every relationship. If you do not feel physically attracted to someone then things may not work out very well. No matter what though you should never be embarrassed to take the person that you are with out in public with you. If you are then you are someone that is not worth being with.

vAMlA5waaa	If he attacks you, you will have to protect yourself  but you have to talk to somebody about these threats. Was somebody else around when he threatened you? Do not be afraid at all, because if push comes to shove you will have to fight back. Make sure though, that somebody knows about these threats.<br>  <br>  He must be very frustrated about something. Perhaps his girl left with a similar guy like you. |`|3PmJrkxpaa	I think that first, you should go to your supervisor and report what he said to you. He is creating a hostile work environment by threatening to physically harm you. And second, avoid him. Ask your friend to come to your place instead of going over there. |`|lsZWgyrwaa	Don't fight back. Push him back lightly if he comes up to you and get into your friends apartment as quickly as you can. If he gets to you before that, report him to the police immediately. Easy way to get him off your back|`|ARlb3XBaaa	Well if he starts to seriously injure you, you have to fight back.  He may be all talk.  Why don't you tell the guy that you don't care if he don't like you and to mind his own business since you obviously have nothing to do with each other.<br>  <br>  If you served in the marine corp why arent you more self assured and letting this guy know you could beat him into oblivion?<br>  <br>  That kinda freaks me out the you defended our country but can't defend yourself.|`|MhpkoHnzaa	i think his problem is that he does not work as much as he did, cause you are now working there as well, and it interferes with his job. i would be wondering if the company is going to fire him and you were the future replacement. at any rate have somebody take a video of this guy if he comes at you, i would also file a complaint with the police dept. on this so they know you were not the one who started this. you are not going to take a beating. you do want to defend yourself, and now that you have a file on this character at the police dept. you should be able to deck him if he comes at you without a problem except a few bruises. people just su*k, kick his azz, and make sure he will not come back at you again. if he has a bat, do not kill him with it but he should be in a wheel chair after that. the knees will slow him down the next time he wants to go at it again. point being said, defend your country as well as your own life.|`|mX6aJSSYaa	Well to tell you the truth you should have reported this the very moment that it happened.<br>  <br>  I work in human resources and this type of problem would not be tolerated. He would have been fired that day for threatening someones life.<br>  <br>  But if he approaches you just ignore him. If he swings on you put that Marine cores skills to work and make him regret what he was thinking.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way if he gets fired, well he got fired for talking **** when he's the only one with a problem. If he wants to fight well then he's just out looking for trouble, and only  going to get more of it in life.<br>  <br>  To me it sounds like an *** hole.<br>  Does he live in Dallas Texas I will whoop him for you.Gladly too. I also am in the ARMY and don't take **** from anyone.|`|wNSpZCCoaa	You should definitely let someone know that you are threatened.  Is there anybody else at work who is having a problem with this dude? Maybe you can join forces and report this knucklehead.  If you are not willing to deal with it at work, maybe you should call your local police department and just get it on record that this guy is threatening you? You said you are meeting your buddy who lives near him - hopefully, this buddy will help you at if the guy comes at you.  I would give your buddy a "heads up" so that he's not caught off guard if the other guy starts something with you.  It may help.  If you were a Marine, you know that you do not start anything - you just finish it!  Semper Fi!|`|TJOHxhEUaa	If you don't mind facing the guy again, try talking to him one more time.  Explain that you don't want trouble and just want things to be cool between the two of you.  If he doesn't back down, tell him you're going to have to talk to whoever supervises the both of you because this situation is going to affect how you two do your jobs.  Then do it.  Seriously, this could get the company in big trouble if he starts something physical.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Awo7g1K4aa	Defend yourself. Don't hit back. Then report it. But I hope he was just kidding for all the stuff he said.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	you should buy some pepper spray.......just in case if he tries to assault you.....just to defend your self without confronting yourself. <br>  <br>  you can try to report it...but there's only so much the police can do.. they will only lock him up if he does assault you (most likely) <br>  <br>  so my suggestion is buy some pepper spray and spray it on him if he tries to hurt you.|`|dthpLcVbaa	It will probably do little to report him before he actually do anything violent. What I'd suggest is ask your buddy to hang out at somewhere else instead. There is no reason to step into the filed of mine when you know it's going to blow. <br>  <br>  Have a drink at the bar or hang out at your place. It shouldn't be that hard. <br>  <br>  Good luck ;-)|`|Fq8yzJamaa	Call the police and file a restraining order.|`|SgnHQhZQaa	I think you should report this right away before it goes any further.

It's hard, you really would have to live through it to have a specific answer.|`|scMMpPciaa	I couldn't give up my kids even if they were not mine. I am sure a custody situation would have to be worked out for the good of the children involved just as if there was a divorce.. so that the kids can know all parents involved. But you can not remove a child completly from the home they have only know even in this situation. You do not take away everything they know and upset their world.|`|nTOuhn9Caa	Be cautious, there have been people who have done this in the past, and also, I would'nt give the baby back, would knowing that this baby really is'nt yours, make you not love he/she as much?|`|wr7YY4kJaa	Hm mm, keep the one I have because he is a blessing. That is a hard one, I would probably go a little crazy and go from there, I am sure I would be forced to trade babies but I would try to get them both.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I don't know how I would handle that.

Hospitals rarely admit to making mistakes such as this one, because it opens them up to lawsuits on so many levels: from doctors, family, later even the children involved. Call the hospital yourself after looking up the number online or in the phonebook to confirm. If you've already done that, you need to call an lawyer. Even if you choose not to sue, you're going to need one. Also, contact the other family involved. Make sure to do a DNA test to confirm. If the other family refuses, have a judge subpoena them. It's more than likely that a judge will become in this situation, unless you are able to settle out of court. However, even if you and the other family wish to keep the child that you have raised thus far, sadly, this is probably not allowed. There are laws regarding things such as this: use your lawyer to find out exactly what they are and how they apply. You can also sue the hospital for negligence (and possibly fraud).<br>  <br>  Make sure you find out that this is legit, because this is very rare.|`|kIsDoNQSaa	Omg. If this happened to u, I don't know how to respond. I'm sorry that happen to u, just don't cut it!<br>  Me personally, I'd be so curious about my child that I would want to participate in their life. How could I not. I don't know if I would be able to swap out the child that I had been raising as my own.<br>  I would shoot for being a big happy family, for the kids sake and my own mental and emotional help.<br>  Then as a family take the hospital to court for all u can and live happily ever after.

JPZ45huxaa	I would be concerned if he indeed is talking about young girls.  Huge red flag.  Other than that,most fantasies are just fantasies.|`|5oUyPxuuaa	yes this is normal. if it was not then the porn industry would not be exploiting girls as they phrase it "barely legal". now if his fantasy dips into younger than the legal age it gets weird because that could mean he is a pedophile. talk to him about it, i wouldn't get too worried unless he asks for a pre-teen|`|ADP9swbMaa	If you mean children by "young girls," then no that is not normal and not healthy. <br>  Think about it: do you want to risk getting married, having a daughter together, and when she's about 8 years old you find out he's molesting her?<br>  Trust me, his thoughts are NOT normal!|`|vn739fgfaa	I'm not a man, and I don't claim to be an expert on their fantasies, but it sounds a little disturbing.. does he have an age limit that he stops at say... he wont look at girls under... 16/17 years old? I think it depends on your age.. and how young the girls are he is fantasizing about.  Judging by the information you gave.. he's a creep!|`|ab0e19f31eedc59cf4fdc0079d4a8b3baa	How young ?  If it's under 18 yrs of age, he has a serious problem.  If he's thinking of it, he may just act on it and that's jail time if he's caught.  |`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	well that's of concern because there can be apossibility he can become a child predator|`|1wQeH0hdaa	Its ok as long as he doesnt try to have sex with a minor..|`|9Jq4a47laa	That's sick, call the police|`|Oyf3ebdvaa	Well if it is like young kids. Then that is not cool. If it is teens then that is pretty normal. Considering how teens look now a days. But I would be concerned if he is likeing children. That is kinda weird and can lead to weirder things. It is good to be open about your sexuallity and such... Sometimes it will go to far. Sounds like to me, he tested you out for a while and you where cool with everything and now, he is pushing a little further cause he has that trust and maybe you would like it also. Becarful cause that could get bad really quick if he starts asking to do other things... |`|iqpiEd8Naa	Fantasies are very normal....but if he is fantasizing about girls that are way young -- that might not be healthy.... I think lots of people fantasize about things they would never do in real life, but if he is verbalizing the fact that he fantasizes about maybe underage girls I would let him know that I do not think that is acceptable.|`|mWeNo44vaa	Be really careful about this. You don't want to be in the home when the cops/FBI come knocking on ya door because he is watching kiddie porn when ur not home. Does the women that he choose to look at seem to be to young?? Are they girls or young women like 18+. Since you mentioned that you guys talk about everything openly talk to him about it. Don't come off as if u are accusing him of being a pedophile though.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	I would suggest you do some snooping, check his computer, cell phone, or blackberry for child pornography.

But if it becomes extreme like i'de say still a child then yea i'de be worried..... 17 would be my limit anything under that i'de start to question him. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope everything stays good in your relationship. Good luck|`|PmX3IqlIaa	two things -<br>  <br>  1)  How old is he?  If he's only 17-ish then girls about 15 or 16 is normal.  If he's 40 then its a lil bit weirder.<br>  <br>  2) Look on the plus side - he could be intrested in young men, and by young men i mean young boys|`|r9i4hbiIaa	I suppose some men feel that way. I'm 25, but look 17/18, and my fiance confessed that's something he really liked about me, that I look so young. So I guess he's not too far alone in that regard.|`|Yhf7oaOqaa	little niggs, little niggs, little niggssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...|`|sXwDCb8Waa	trust me, its perfectly normal. he means like 18 or 19 year olds|`|TRzsmcquaa	it's not. he'll be a DOM in a few more years|`|AA11945637	it is a problem: borderline pedophile|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	Over 18 is cool but anything under that is scary and dangerous.|`|7THgBSvfaa	It depends on how young he is talking. If he talking about girls that haven't even hit puberty..well that is just gross. I think it is normal for guys to fantasy about younger women but I think you need to make sure that it stays a fantasy and that he doesn't forget about you.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Depends on just HOW young!  If it's younger than around 16 or 17 then that's pretty disturbing. |`|QzWHMGHJaa	No he's talking about child porn, you are with a sick, sick person!|`|mPSTNmPSaa	You don't have to even ask this question to know that there is something terribly wrong. The more we do sexually, the more open, nasty, perverted, we do in our relationship, the more it's going to take to turn us on. This has gotten way out of hand. Being attracted to little girls is not normal. Maybe he had always been into little girls, and figures he can get away with it with you because of how "nasty" the two of you get. I get the whole "open" and "nasty" sex thing. Love it, but a line has been crossed. You need to tell him to immediately stop this or you are gone, and will make a complaint to the police department. I would look on him computer as well, look in his history, and if you find anything that has to do with little girls, report him immediately so he can be stopped, and his daughter won't get hurt. Good Luck!!!
eyiHpFctaa	negative boss. We generally care about the guy first, and if hes not big in the pants as you put it, that doesnt mean hes not good in bed. We ladies tend to be into sex for the emotional part of it more than physical.|`|c65yMMNRaa	Either really experienced girls or slutty girls typically...<br>  i Mean the type of pretty nice girl who is into settling down would typically fall in love with you as a person first...<br>  I didnt care about the size of my bf's --- i just knew that i loved him and wanted to spend the rest of my life with him (even after only a month dating).<br>  |`|XqfH76PMaa	No one who is looking for a serious relationship is overly concerned about a guys size.  |`|plzqxk6taa	Not really from experience, if shes into you she won't really care.

She should be finding out those things before penis size, anyway.<br>  <br>  Additionally:<br>  Average vaginal depth is 5.5 inches.<br>  Average penis length is 5.6 inches.<br>  <br>  So if you're huge, it's not actually going to get you anywhere unless your girl is also on the larger end, and may actually be uncomfortable for the girl if she is average or smaller.|`|ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	To an extent yes. Physically it is easier to try different positions if a guy is well endowed. He does not have to be huge, just well endowed. But if a girl truly loves a guy for his other qualities that would be what would matter most.  The rest of it can be worked through to a very beautiful satisfying sex life. |`|hhSgIbSHaa	not i dont at all that doesnt even matter to me at all i love people for who they are and it doesnt need to be big to work|`|HvUurCygaa	some girls really do care & some others not really<br>  <br>  <br>  so??..................

No man is going to live with a girl as a room mate unless he is not into her. I will say this if he has taken you to the apartment to meet her and you have met her and talked to her face to face to get her side then you have nothing to worry about. If you have not met her nor talked to her nor been invited ova to hang out with them then there is something fishy going on.|`|cO1BiUNzaa	I don't know but I had to answer this cause that is beat up! <br>  <br>  It is wrong for guy to be in a relationship and still live with female roommate. He can always move in with his girlfriend if he needs a room mate.<br>  <br>  I know I wouldn't be happy if my girl lived with another man. Maybe if he is castrated then it would be a little bit better but I still wouldn't like it.|`|nCc1nI2waa	It depends on whether they were living together before or after ya'll got together and if you met her.... If they lived together before you got together and you met her then you need to trust and let it go but if they lived together after you got together ad you aint met her yet then she need to go!!!|`|ACwzexe3aa	I would be mad, upset, jealous, and confused.<br>  C'mon, you have no idea what they could be doing..<br>  But I guess it depends on how well you know him.<br>  If you trust the both of them then it should be fine.<br>  But if you're having doubts and suspect something is going on between them, talk to him about it and tell him that she needs to go..|`|jjuvu0Yaaa	well it depends what their relationship was like first. & also yur relationship with yur boyfrind( like newly dating,ect...)<br>  <br>  And being a girl, yu prob have like a womans intuition.<br>   <br>  If yu feel as if yu should feel uncomfortable then talk to him.. <br>  If yu trust him, then it shouldnt really be an issue.

KnT943rjaa	...nah you cant..unfortunately you cant change people.  Im learning that lesson the hard way right now...trust me its tough when you think you know someone and then they show a side of them you have never seen, and you want to change them so much but you just cant.

4s9OvB4eaa	I have done it.  When I am working through a stressful situation, it is as if I "clean" up the mess of my problem as I go along cleaning in the house ... seems almost therapeutic in a way.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I know that I do it, my mother does it and both of my sisters do it.  As soon as we get mad we get up and start cleaning the house.  I think we do it to distract ourselves from the anger and to work out energy.  So, no, you aren't crazy!|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	When I am really upset (hurt), I start cleaning.  I don't know why, maybe its a stress eliminator.  It is creepy.|`|FrHhkAaSaa	maybe|`|Wq35a5goaa	It takes a lot of energy to clean, so yes, I have done it when angry. It's a great way to blow off steam and get something done at the same time!  But sometimes cleaning is just cleaning...|`|234OLmeYaa	i think ur right... i think mothers clean when they get angry because they are putting all their anger into cleaning stuff... so its not wierd if u get a clean house. <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this is the answer to ur problem...|`|JRQw34Mmaa	My mum does this! Another thing that annoys me is that she wakes me up by hovering my room!|`|JTzk57a5aa	No, shes talking and keep talking..|`|pKzH1cFHaa	My mom goes and hides when she is angry. I think the house would have never been messy when I was a kid if she cleaned the house every time she was angry.|`|JbJA6Gt6aa	It sounds like it might be a way for her to vent her frustration. She could be projecting her anger to you subtly, maybe you aren't helping enough. Help out around the house, or talk to her about it. It seems hard at first, but if you can be open with your mom/dad, you'll have a lot more success with relationships in the future.
3vNuc4Kjaa	here's the trick that helped me out a ton;<br>  when you get into school in the morning, and for the rest of the day, say hi to everybody you see that you feel even the least bit comfortable saying hi to.  Every day, add someone you hadn't said hi to before, until you pretty much say hi to everybody that you see.  The reason this works is because if you say hi to someone in the morning, they'll be more likely to start a random conversation with you later in the day.  It'll help you make friends and just have more fun with life.  just try it, it works, trust me.  |`|31fDBuLjaa	Don't force conversations ... needs to be comfortable and natural.<br>  <br>  Join school clubs. Doesn't matter which - just join.

Happy smiley people give off this aroma that everyone wants to be around and smile a lot, i love cheerful people no matter how shy they are.|`|90XVgs1laa	The easiest way to get people to talk to you is to ask them about themselves - nod at the right spot - listen and inject just enough about yourself for them to ask you a question or two.<br>  <br>  If there is a girl you think you want to be friends with say something like - I love your bag/sweater/phone.. where did you get it?   then talk about fashion - pop stars .. the election blah blah... you are looking for her opinon then you can add yours.<br>  <br>  next time you see her say - Hi (her name) ..friendships build they do not come in a ready made package. good luck.|`|Fw2yHgrOaa	go traveling and talk to strangers and get some practice (just be sure not to follow them on alleyways and always keep your purse close to you)...

Or have you recently moved in a totally new place?<br>  <br>  Firstly, find the most kind-looking girl and ask her for help on something easy (You don't have to need the help for real) Then let her help you and then thank her alot. This way start talking to her and offer something you think she needs and try to make company.<br>  <br>  After a while you get what you need and you can screw her if she's not cool and go after someone cooler.|`|47d4ae5d10fc179c45bb3f23a53c4b2aaa	there are no fixed problem solvers like that...if you try to use somethin like that it will look artificial...the only way is to go out there and socialize even if you feel terribly shy...people will appriciate it and will try to uncharge the situation for you to be more comfortable talking to them...people may seem scary, but everyone has issues, so just go out there and have fun...that`s the only way really...this is life and this is how we overcome our fears...|`|mDzOujJQaa	Smile hold the door for ppl and all that and then just talk about stuff that happened i guess i mean its easier said than done but all you have to do is go a little bit out of your comfort zone to get away from your shyness and then things would be easier. Good Luck ! :)|`|VDDFKfTPaa	I have learned that people love to talk about themselves... everyone! So, just comment of someones shoes or shirt or book bag and this should help get things moving.

Join something. <br>  <br>  Conversation starters may be good but may not be as effective. Join a youth club, a soccer team, a scrapbookers group, a ballet class ANYTHING! and you will definately make friends. <br>  <br>  If you want to try starter conversations here's the way to go. If you are sitting beside someone and they are talking out loud to a general group and they say something like I had amazing apple pie last night, jump in and say" I fricken love amazing apple pie!" or be honest and say, "Really?! I'm not going to lie, I actually hate apple pie"<br>  <br>  You know? I mean if its a conversation between two people don't jump in on it. And definately make eye contact, and say hello to the kids you see on a regular basis. I'm sure that you have observed some people that you would really like to be friends with. A simple smile is a great start to a friendship.<br>  <br>  You can get over the shyness. I know you can.

I hate it because I have a hard time knowing if somebody is just not into me or if they just don't like to call.  <br>  <br>  Once I got together with my ex-boyfriend, he told me that he thought for a long time that I didn't like him because I didn't call him very much.  However, he never called me either!  That is why I thought he wasn't interested, but apparently he was.  Guys just like to be confusing, and they are all different.  Some will think you are desperate if you call and others will think that you don't like them.|`|SgG2980taa	Yes, and guys hate to have to start the conversation over the phone. so we never call, we rather talk in person...
jEtdLUyVaa	Assuming that there is no awkwardness because he is your ex-boyfriend's friend, then yeah, I see no problem with asking him to a basketball game.

I find that high school girls really like that. <br>  <br>  I will get thumbs down for this, but trust me here.....<br>  <br>  Smack a girls butt, tell her she looks hot in a certain pair of jeans, than when she talks to you later, be aloof and act like you could care less about her presence. <br>  <br>  Girls like the chase and boys like the kill if that makes any sense to you.<br>  <br>  Your problem may be that these girls feel like they could have you at anytime they wanted, and that's bad, you want to be at least a little "un attainable."<br>  <br>  Just my opinion. |`|d45c5ec5ec9b57aa10b92d94f9ed3700aa	most girls have that bad boy fantasy where they want one of those on-edge relationships... but those are not lasting relationships. they don't last long and/or they're very unhealthy. <br>  nice guys are good guys. nice guys are the ones the parents love and some girls really listen to their parents' opinions. i'm sure someone has liked you and you just never saw it because you were too busy trying to just be a nice guy in general to all girls. <br>  personally, you sound like a really good guy and i would date you based off of what you said about yourself.<br>  <br>  and no, they don't finish last. |`|H92Yava5aa	Please, please, I beg you!!  DON'T change!!  There is a shortage of guys like you!  As girls grow up, they want guys like you, they want the nice guy.  However, by the time they realize that, the good guys are all but extinct.  So just be patient, because one day you'll find a girl who counts herself the luckiest girl on the planet to have found you.|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Be patient the girl for you is out there somewhere!<br>  with maturity will come the realization that the Jerk will allways be a jerk .<br>  Not the one they want as a husband or father of their children!<br>  So byde your time yours will come.|`|AA12376468	don't change to fit in.<br>  let them see you for who you are.<br>  <br>  You Sound Like a Great Person To Be In Love With.<br>  You really do.  <br>  <br>  Jerks usually get what they deserve in the end.|`|9K3kCCnaaa	Hmmm. I'm actually the same way. I guess I just like being hurt... I'm also wanting to find a right guy for me. Seems a fail because i'm so shy.. |`|53R43zLGaa	everyone loves a bad boy <br>  plus its not about good and bad<br>  theres bunches of variables <br>  attractivness, personality etc|`|aG20ruqYaa	no dont ever change. if u r a nice guy and wait a bit a girl will like u. they just need time 2 c that ur not a jerk|`|UsnLjpxKaa	You can be a nice guy, but most nice guys are really shy and many girls see this as "this guy doesn't know how to have fun". You can be a nice guy but don't be afraid to be stupid or foolish a little bit, you don't have to be a jerk just be adventurous/confident. Girls at school don't like the guy who is always serious. |`|IZj6IFEEaa	of course not! nice guys are definitely the ones who end up with the great job and family and all the good stuff in the end. girls love the nice guy, if you like someone though you just need to be extra ambitious because the girl will probably just think you are being your nice self, like you treat everyone else... don't change though! the nice guys are the best.<br>  <br>  |`|MuUZIpmdaa	oh, bull sh*t!!  if your the nice guy, you should be crouded by girls!!!<br>  i have no idea what they put in the mulk at your school, but mabye your not *cool* enought...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me out, man? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmVdu5dJDNArJTJbKauzUhTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081028204644AAygPK0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|IKrJ3gjiaa	id date you =]<br>  <br>  don't give up<br>  <br>  theyll notice you sooner or later|`|XoDANituaa	nice guys ALWAYS finish first.  just be patient... love will come <3|`|EYd6vorxaa	keep being nice dont give up, girls will realize that ur better then the jerks their just stupid|`|AA12144636	yes, nice guys do finish last.  sorry, but its true.   Girls want a guy that earns "respect."  They don't want a guy that will do everything for them and let the girl run over them.  There is no respect in that.  If a girl is with you and tells you that's what she wants, she is using you.

AA10398889	Anything can have an effect on your mental state which would alter your performance in school, however if its a bad alteration, it usually evens out after a while and you go back to normal, but you may also be more relaxed and do better because of your new environment. Than again, nothing may happen at all. The mind is a complex thing|`|W2ma71Tjaa	I don't really think that the bedroom would... does it matter on the shape or size of the bedroom at all? As long as you have your familiar furniture and things that comfort you, it will not affect your education. It really doesn't matter as long as you yourself work hard and do what you'd do to succeed!|`|c0b4ab9ebb0b2058659de74cc5aa8b63aa	I seriously doubt it. If anything, it might be good for you. Just wondering.. why would you think such a thing?|`|EYOqHja1aa	it all depends on your attitude. no|`|hsZjdk6Raa	definitely not!  it could affect your mood though!  like if you are going from a bright cheery room to a dark dreary room...it could be a little depressing...but the only thing that can effect your education is YOU!!  good luck on the room change!  why are you changin???
ygVTtSNVaa	Demand? No. Expect? Yes. But how can you be mad? Thats so sweet that he was hanging with the kids. I understand it was your anniversary but if this is how every anniversary goes what would make you think this one would be different? |`|4POGapREaa	I'm sorry about that.  I'm not big on anniversaries, birthdays, etc. so it's kind of hard for me to understand the big disappointment.  But if he knew it was important to you & didn't follow through, then you have a right to be upset.  In the future, rule #1 is to never expect him to actually make the plans.  I know that sucks but you kind of have to take over that part or it will never happen.  The type of man you're dealing with is just not big on these things & probably never will be.  You have to find a happy medium.  Get him to say yes & then you plan it.  He should have at least been considerate enough to get a card though.  |`|zL1sggpCaa	Have you always requested something to do? If that is the case... that may be what the problem is. <br>  <br>  I would say if you want more... give more. (you reap what you sow) If you want romance... do it. I say wy not this weekend, call your Mom up and see if the kids can stay for the weekend... or at least over night. Then, pack a sexy little outfit, and go over night. Get you a cabin with a fire place and a hot tub. Shower him with attention and affection. When he asks why... just state that you love him and wanted a great evening away, just the two of you.<br>  <br>  Also, leading up to this weekend, why not play... Finding love... Leave little notes for your husband or cute cards and such, where he'll find them. <br>  <br>  I put one in my husband's sock drawer... one inside his under shirts (about the third shirt down).... a poem I wrote in his truck sprayed with my perfume... etc... And what I got in return was a more loving and romantic husband on more days. Instead of a few times a year, things get better a few times a month. It just might work for you.|`|66l0BPhaaa	as a man myself, he is being selfish. he does not want to have alone time with you, what is his problem. we as married people need a break every now and then. right now i am spoiled because i am on my third weekend with no children at home, lots of alone time. so you ddo have a right to demand more.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think you do.  I'm a little like your husband.  She always made arrangements for sitters and stuff.  It has been hard for me to shift gears and start doing it even when I want to.  Let him start with some easy stuff like a dinner instead of a 24 hour getaway.|`|AA10248966	I'd stop cooking, cleaning, SHOPPING doing his laundry and make him sleep elsewhere in the house. If he balks, tell him until this is resolved to your satisfaction with a marriage counselor, he can expect more of the same. If he values you, the marriage, etc. He will cooperate. <br>  <br>  Not cooperating after one month means he does Not love you, period. This is a no <br>  brainer. I would never ever have thought of ignoring such ban important date. <br>  <br>  Husband also might need psychological testing for emotional, behavioral and  anxiety disorders as well as depression.<br>  <br>   Get HIM to agree to get complete batteries of tests at an outpatient clinic form a hospital With a psych wing for adult mental disorders. If he balks, divorce him. <br>  <br>  That type of behavior is too wierd and I think mental illness is involved.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Your husband is right. You ruined the day. A marriage is not about a romantic getaway, it is about love and respect. My guess is that your husband loves you and the kids. He brings home his paycheck and he doesn't go to bars and chase other women. If I were you, I would apologize and it will surprise him because you've likely acted like a princess for the past eleven years. Be thankful you have a nice husband. Make him his favorite dinner and make plans together for another weekend getaway. Be nice. He deserves it!|`|26uZW3Q3aa	I'm a husband and I understand both sides.  He messed up.  He probably has good intentions but didn't set aside the time to plan something.  Women want to know that the husband took time to plan something... they take that to mean that the husband holds the anniversary as an important event.  <br>  <br>  You have a right to demand more.  |`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	yes!!!! you deserve at least ONE night out of the WHOLE freaking year to have some time alone with YOUR husband. he needs to show that he cares and that he values having you by his side as a wife, companion, mother, and so much more! he should celebrate having you by his side by taking you out on a romantic getaway. girl! you need to talk to him how you feel and you feel underappreciated because he does not put a little romance into your life|`|0wdEcNk1aa	It doesn't sound like your husband is one to celebrate things too much, while you build expectations up in your mind as to how things should go. So don't demand more, make sure that you get it. YOU make the plans, and set them in motion and simply allow him to foot the bill. He will go along and enjoy and your expections will be met!|`|7736c62316b98f00434255fb65e5c3e9aa	I make all the plans for our anniversaries, I make the reservations, arrange babysitters, put money away, tell him which days to ask off for work, etc. If I relied on my husband to make all the arrangements we probably would not do anything either.|`|AA11328507	Your hubby is clearly clueless and it sounds like YOU will have to do all the planning if you expect things to work out like they should.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Nothing wrong with wanting more but demanding is wrong.<br>  He won't change for you so accept him for who he is.|`|pOTigVYPaa	My heart goes out to you.  It appears that you are investing more in the marriage than your husband.  You said that pretty much every anniversary goes this way.  My question to you is why do you enable your husband to continue being a jerk?  11 years is a long time to put up with this behavior.  You need to give your husband a message.  When his birthday comes around do not get him a birthday card, cake, gift, etc.  Don't even bring the day up in conversation.  When his birthday has come and gone without your recognizing it, he undoubtedly will ask you why?  Reminde him of Nov. 1st. and say nothing more. If he doesn't get the message then, make an appointment with a marriage counselor.  Good luck!|`|pma90Xycaa	Since we're only hearing one side of the story here, it's hard to tell if you were at fault or if he was.  Do you think you did nothing wrong in the entire situation and that he did everything wrong?  Does he think that you did everything wrong?  Maybe when you told him that you wanted the 24 hour getaway you expected him to make the arrangements and he expected you to make them.  In that case, it's no one's fault--just a simple matter of miscommunication.  I don't know why it is that he chose to work with the kids when you guys were free and clear, but again, I don't know the entire situation. <br>  <br>  My suggestion for you in the future is just to make arrangements yourself.  Sure, it's less romantic, but at least then you know you'll get exactly what you want out of him. :-)|`|cJra9Qfxaa	Yes. This is a day that meant something to you. He could have made an effort to at least find a babysitter.<br>  Nights out together are important to keep the relationship going. Try to explain to him that it hurt your feelings that he didn't put time into your date - anniversary or not. Explain that you need time with him away from the kids so rekindle the love/friendship/romance/etc.|`|FU2a2WSiaa	Yes you do have a right to demand more!! My husband is the exact same way "selfish". He went on a bike trip for my birthday for a week... So I was stuck at home w/ the kids on my bday, which dont get me wrong it was fine w/ me, but it's the whole point of it all ya know. <br>  <br>  But I think you definitely have all the right in the world to be mad!! I would be so livid... |`|lU94subOaa	Sorry to tell you but he is no longer in love with you.  There is no way a man who is Truly in love with a woman that could ignore her very existence.  Sorry.|`|601gOwNnaa	If it's the way you tell it, I'd say you're right.<br>  <br>  Be careful about demands and ultimatums though.  <br>  <br>  I'd try to have a civil conversation about it.  |`|WAYm7DNcaa	Of course you have the right to want more!  Sounds like he is not very appreciative of having you as a wife.  Maybe you should bend him over your leg and give him a good spanking~  :)|`|AA11356977	Im not into holidays or annv. I feel it is more important that I feel loved and cared about on a day to day basis. And I do!!!! Everyones expectations are different.|`|FbcFcf4oaa	Yes, why not!  he is too comfortable in the relationship.  You should read the book Men are from Mars Women are from Venus.  It truly tells you how different men and women are!  |`|TkSY2ZUfaa	Why didn't you set up a babysitter? |`|Ite8nZqVaa	He sounds passive aggressive. My guess is he is unhappy but lacks the cojones to let you know. |`|9ykAQxJxaa	Me and you sound a lot alike when it comes to the anniversary celebrations, romance, etc.  What is different about us is that I'm only engaged at this point in time and we don't have children yet.  (I'm 24, my fiancee is 26).  <br>  <br>  My fiancee sounds somewhat like your husband...kinda oblivious to the fact that it would mean so much to me for him to be creative and take the initiative to plan something such as a 24 hour getaway for us every now and again.  The way I fixed this, I had a heart to heart talk with him and told him how I "lived for the moments like those" and how one of the qualities that made me fall in love with him to begin with was his willingness to impress me and sweep me off my feet.  Luckily he listened to what I had to say and while he's not always perfect he tries to be more creative when it comes to our little romantic getaways now.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your anniversary by the way!!|`|N5v2j6hPaa	ignore him ....and more so on your anniversary....my hubby can be like a child.... the more I ***** the more he gets defensive....<br>  <br>   if I ignore him and act like everything is happy wonderful do what you want kinda thing....he comes around...for instance....every friday he went to his friends patricks house....so one friday I went out alone met some friends had a couple drinks when hubby noticed I wasnt home and Im always home...and i mean always with dinner ready etc....<br>  <br>  ...he called my cell  and honestly i didnt hear phone....when i came home he asked me where i was and I said you always go to pats so I went out for a little....since then friday nights he is here....<br>  <br>  I wouldnt demand....you deserve more but the more you demand things the less he will hear you actions speak louder than words....|`|woUh3KL7aa	Let's see, you told him in advance what you wanted, he had time to plan or ask for your help to plan it. Then the day comes and you make effort to salvage the day, but he works on HIS stuff. You still wanted something from him, and he still didn't even pony up for a card...*pathetic*....but you are supposed to raise his kids, love him, cook, clean, and be there for him the other 364 days of the year and he can't even do a card. <br>  <br>  You can demand all you want, but I suspect the only thing that will work is either ditching your expectations and hopes about him, and possibly ditching him totally....or setting up something special for yourself,such as a day-spa, with massage, pedicure, manicure etc and have him pay for it. Buy yourself some nice clothes, do your hair and then go out with friends for the anniversary. When you come home looking AMAZING, he will definately want to go out with you, and even if he doesn't, you can go with friends (main plan) and maybe meet someone, a new friend who can really appreciate YOU. If that doesn't get your husband to sit up and realize your value, and if you don't value yourself, he won't either. <br>  <br>  If he gets upset saying it's your anniversary...explain that previously he let you down, and you don't want to burden him. Watch what happens,plus you will be happier and more relaxed after taking care of yourself.

Doesn't wanna be touched, held, or intimate. When they start giving you signs about "having more time to hang around with friends" or when "they need a break".When all of a sudden their friends matter more then you do. When they just don't care anymore if you get emotional. There's alot of signs that may be possible for when a partner is cheating on you. Another good one is when he/she decides to party more, and be away from home and doesn't call you or pick up his/her phone. When they have weird numbers calling in and out at ackward timings. If you think about it, most of the times you have that strong feeling which people call the "gut-feeling" that they are spending their precious time with someone else.|`|AvhJoL5baa	Seven common warning signs someone is cheating on you:<br>  <br>  1. The most common warning is when a partner tells you something is amiss and you don't believe it. He or she may say, 'This marriage isn't working,' or 'I am not happy.'<br>  2. Sudden change -- or interest -- in appearance.<br>  3. If your partner says, 'You need to see a psychiatrist,' 'You need help,' 'Get a job,' 'Lose weight,' or 'Go to the gym,' and is constantly critical, it's all part of the same theme -- which is that there is something wrong with you.  Unconsciously, they are setting it up to say their partner was nuts and wouldn't even go for help.  Another tip-off is when he or she starts picking fights about something you are good at, so you fight back and then he or she calls you argumentative.<br>  4. Gives you guilt gifts.<br>  5. If you get the cold shoulder at your spouse's company holiday party where everyone used to be friendly, it's a sign that his colleagues either know about the affair and figure you are on the way out, so why be nice? Or your partner has been making critical comments about you so they think you are no good.<br>  6. When a partner is sneaking around a bit, it's a sign. Maybe he or she takes secret cell phone calls on the porch instead of using the phone by the bed, or maybe he is out on weeknights whereas he used to be home watching television.  If you see that a person is not around that much and is gone on different nights, something may be up.<br>  7. Sometimes people with a background of these types of things may be more likely to repeat them. There are exceptions and people can change patterns in their life, but if we are talking about red flags, history is a red flag.<br>  |`|dATEaYhlaa	there are alot of signs that you can watch that your partner has been cheating on you <br>  Here are a couple:<br>  spend less and less and less time with you<br>  doesnt pick up phone <br>  has lots of excuses to wher she's been<br>  she acts differently <br>  When together she speaks less<br>  gets mad at you more<br>  <br>  Hope this help and if he or she is cheating on you Sorry and hope you find another person better than her.|`|cdf2579820f7a9165895666cca1dc9ebaa	1 - When they no longer want sex or makes excuses to not have sex.<br>  <br>  2 - When they will not allow you access to their computer or they suddenly shut down the computer when you walk into the room. They may password protect their laptop or computer to keep out suspicious eyes. Or they stay up to "work" or "play a game" on the computer after you go to bed. Excessive internet usage, especially late at night, is a red flag. <br>  <br>  3 - When they begin to put distance between you or show a lack of interest in what has been the routine with few, if any, excuses for the change in their behavior.<br>  <br>  4 - When they suddenly have to work late and have all kinds of new obligations that take them away from home repeatedly or for long periods of time. Or. . . they tell you they are working longer hours and discontinue allowing you to view their paycheck or pay stubs.<br>  <br>  5 - If your loved one works with people, such as at a bar or restaurant especially as a waitress or bartender they might suddenly tell you not to visit them at work.  This usually means they are hiding something at their workplace whether it be with a co-worker or a regular customer such as at a bar.<br>  <br>  6 - When they suddenly need a cell phone or pager and you are discouraged from ever looking at it or using it. They also may make certain their cell phone or pager cannot be answered by you by hiding it or taking it with them wherever they go. They are secretive about their cell phone or pager bill and pay it themselves when you have always paid the bill in the past.<br>  <br>  7 - When they arrive home smelling faintly of perfume/cologne or another person's body. <br>  <br>  8 - When they arrive home and head straight into the shower or bath. <br>  <br>  9 - When they have lipstick or strange hairs on their clothing or in the car. Finding strange phone numbers, receipts or condoms can also be clues. <br>  <br>  10 - When they suddenly begin to treat you extremely nice; more so than usual. <br>  <br>  11 - When they begin to make "kinky" requests or suggest wildly erotic play during sex including things you have never done before. They may also show an increased interest in sex or sexual things, including porn. <br>  <br>  12 - When they talk to you they treat you abusively or with disdain, disrespect or excessive sarcasm. They may also demonstrate an unexplained aloofness or indifference in the relationship. Or. . . they may begin to find fault in everything you do in an attempt to justify their affair. <br>  <br>  13 - Her: When she gets spiffed up and dresses provocative to "go grocery shopping" or to "get her hair done." She may also show up with a sudden change of hair style.

Example : "Why are you so luvy duvy?  I'm just not like that."<br>  <br>  20 - When your phone bill shows an increase in unexplained toll or long distance charges. Often when a partner is acting too close or flirting with a best friend of the opposite sex, you will find their phone number listed excessively. <br>  <br>  21 - When the passenger seat in the car has been changed and is not in the usual position or the mileage on the car is more than usual. Also increased gas purchases that are inconsistent with the amount of miles on the car. <br>  <br>  22 - When they begin to keep a change of clothes hidden in the trunk of the car or an unusual amount of clothes changes at the gym. <br>  <br>  23 - When you notice credit card charges for gifts (such as florist or jewelry) that you didn't receive. <br>  <br>  24 - When they begin to make sudden and excessive purchases of clothes or an unexplained change in clothing style. Beginning to purchase sexy underwear or lingerie may be a clue. <br>  <br>  25 - When you notice an increase in ATM withdrawals. Cheating costs money! To play you must pay! <br>  <br>  26 - When you notice that your partner loses their ability and desire to show the children the attention they need or a lack of desire to do any fix-ups around the house, e.g., lawn care, painting, cleaning the garage, house repairs, etc.  They might turn this around on you at the same time and accuse you of never doing anything or treating the child/children badly.<br>  <br>  27 - When you notice an increased attention to losing weight or paying more attention to their appearance.<br>  <br>  28 - When they begin to volunteer to |`|bofv9JDbaa	the way they smell or taste helps i guess, cause it can be different after they have been with someone<br>  <br>  <br>  but there is also the fact that they'll have to work more or have plans or other stuff to do.<br>  <br>  They won't answer their phone or emails around you.<br>  <br>  <br>  THE MOST KNOWN- what ever you do wrong, will be pointed out more to put the blame on you and keep it off of them|`|t5EE6WO8aa	starts working long hours all of the sudden when you know he hates his job, is never home on the weekends anymore, never wants to make love anymore, spends too much time on his looks, starts going to the gym more often, makes lame excuses that you know aren't true, stops answering the phone for you when you call, comes home with a different scent that doesn't belong to you or him, is very private with his phone, becomes distant towards you, doesn't get mad at all, doesn't joke at all with you anymore, stops saying i love you, shows little, if any affection at all towards you, etc...|`|3F0Ai04Oaa	If you think your partner is cheating..some signs would be (if you lived together).

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	The Arya Samaj Mandir Marriage between two Hindus is absolutely legal & valid marriage for all purposes. The only problem in this case is that this Hindu Marriage has not be got registered with the Registrar of Marriages of the District where the parties reside & got married,hence a Valid Marriage Certificate issued by the Registrar of Marriages after the process of registration of the Hindu Marriage has not been obtained,which may be required for the purpose of divorce proceedings in this case. Second point here is with regard to ground of divorce on the basis of getting divorce,which as you state is is the husband is unemployed or not working,this is no ground for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act,1954. The divorce by mutual consent can be considered if both parties agree but that requires lot of deliberation through a lawyer & making both parties agree for this. The very fact the divorce proceedings can be filled only after one year of the marriage. How much time has passed in this marriage & under what circumstance this is causing exceptional hardship to the petitioner has to be seen even to get leave of the court to file divorce before one year has elapsed in exceptional cases.|`|4QevJfysaa	its not possible...|`|dNhgIMIPaa	I don't really think YOU can divorce them.

KZFRoBgJaa	OK, I can help you.<br>  <br>  Age is definatly nothing but a number. It depends on what you have in your hearts. Before you get married, think about what the requirments mean. Think of differnt scenarious. Like for example, one says, in sickness and in health. What if he's sick and the sickness causes him to be a real azzhole and you cant stand to be around him? how would you handle that situation? does his personality help the issue? think about all of that. <br>  <br>  ? then, save up money. i see that alot on here but seriously, unexpected payments arise out of NOWHERE. you could have a car accident, do you have insureance? whatabout enough money for medical bills, light bills and gas bills? Have a goal to reach at least over 1,000 dollars in the bank thats untouchable. Money makes people do strange things. No money makes people try anything to survive.<br>  <br>  ? have great communication. a little screw up in communication could mess up everything in a relationship. Like him telling you he's going to the mall, and then he changes his mind and decides to go out to eat and happends to see an old friend thats a girl and they have lunch while you go to the mall to surprise him with something. but you find he's not there and then you hear that he went to lunch with another female! That little mistake can cause a whole chain of issues. BE OPEN WITH EACH OTHER.<br>  <br>  ? You don't need a wedding planner to do things that you can do yourself if you want them done correctly. Have a budget. Find things in bulk, like at Costco and save up wedding things in a storage. shop around Black market days when everything is ridiculously cheap. Go to different websites and make notes of what all needs to be done. pick a dress that fits you correctly, sometimes what looks nice makes you feel uncomfortable. let guests know way in advance every every two weeks remind them so you don't have to stress about how many head counts thats comming. the caterer needs to know how much hes's cooking for so try and get people to RSVP as quickly as possible. Have correct phone numbers and addresses for guests and plan ahead. if you do decide to get a wedding planner you want to choose one that has good, DAM good references. ? LOVE IS THICKER THAN ANYTHING ~Stay that way forever n always~|`|xxDjV6Axaa	You would plan it just like anyone else.  Think of how you want your wedding to be and what your budget is.  Even if you have a small budget, a wedding planner can help you.

They can get the most out what money you have to spend.|`|108cbf465aba14d306cf8d0e8081f6e3aa	First, don't classify your wedding as a "teenage wedding." You don't want to emphasize how young you are at your wedding, you want to emphasize your maturity.<br>  <br>  A traditional wedding - white-and-black -  might show your mature side. However, traditional-with-a-twist might emphasize your individuality more. Wear traditional white, but also use contrasting colors that are your favorites to emphasize your personal style.<br>  <br>  Don't go over-the-top, so that your wedding appears to be a girlish fairy tale wedding. Do try being conservative (of resources) and minimalist to show your serious side.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	No criticism here- you sound like an intelligent young woman who knows what she wants.

Also, try not to start a family too soon- you want to be emotionally and financially prepared for that major step.  Just enjoy being married for a while before the babies come along.<br>  <br>  Oh, and one more thing- don't forsake your education just because you're married.  You can't rely on your "MRS" degree to keep you afloat.  I know it's unromantic to think about, but you have to plan for unforseen circumstances.  What if you get a divorce?  What if your husband dies or becomes too disabled to work?  You have to have a Plan B so you can keep your family financially stable, and the best way to ensure that is to go to college and earn your degree.  If you and your husband do all that,I'm sure you'll have a long, happy marriage.  Luck!|`|BlSwxngGaa	I got married at 18 and it was the biggest mistake of my life. If you REALLY love this man and he loves you, you guys should seriously wait!!!! Save up some money, get a house, get a car, GRADUATE, get a job, go to college. If I would have waited, I'd probably still be married. We ended up getting a divorce because we had NO money and all of our bills stressed us out and we ended up taking it out on each other. If we would have waited it would have been ten times easier. You should consider waiting. You can never be TOO prepared but if you're not prepared enough, it could ruin your relationship.|`|UUKmn4Qwaa	get a wedding planner  :)  yay|`|JRRsjByCaa	talk to your parents|`|AUmbzMFjaa	Congratulations!! First, make sure you have a good idea of what you want, for instance: inside/outside, what season, budget, time of day, etc. After you get an idea, set the date and decide the place you want to have it. Then all the rest will come. :D Good luck. I planned my wedding in 3 months, and at the last minute my venue cancelled and we had to find somewhere else to have our wedding; it was 2 days before hand. But, we were uncomfortable with the lady that owned the place we were going to have it at, so it turned out to a huge blessing because we had a blast! So, if you're not comfortable with anything, don't feel obligated to keep it. :D|`|4cNF9DPxaa	Because you are young, I would recommend having a smaller wedding and saving money to put toward building a life together. Other than that, plan it like you would any other wedding. Decide what appeals to the two of you--how big, how formal, how local--and pull it off. One cool idea would be to have a very small (like, 10 people small) wedding and then throw a bigger reception for everyone. It can be less formal, but just as celebratory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hRlPw186aa	The best tip for any bride...of any age is: Talk to everyone you know.  Figure out who knows who, and who can help with what.  If your friends or family have connections to people who can give you a discount or just help with something it will help a lot.  If you have friends that could DJ for you, or bake the cake, or take the pictures...Tell them that that can be their wedding present to you.  It will help tons!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0w5PozDuaa	i started using littleweddingguide.com as a reference for planning. its been good to me. first figure out how many people you want to invite - all else - catering, size of reception area will depend on it. the website has a nice time schedule for the newly engaged. all depends on how much you are willing to spend.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|XqfH76PMaa	Remember, communication is very important.  That is what pulled me an my husband through most things.  We talk about everything.  And, be aware of how hard it can be.  But, nothing worth having comes easy.  It does take a little time to adjust to being married and living together but you will be fine.  Just remember to talk.  Good luck!  I wish you both the best!|`|a53a89eac24066a5fcdfe4b59b5bbeedaa	usually there are companies  ,that can give you some good tips or even help you  with the planing stuff<br>  You can find some ideas in the net ,i do not know exactly what would you like to know<br>  but MAZAL TOV|`|9bbd7b20993d59a4dc5fb11f5999a873aa	Before you marry, you need to put back some cash. Create a nest egg for the both of you so that if something majer happens then you have a safty net to fall on.
itipcHnIaa	What makes you think your junk is so special that you can have 6 girlfriends?|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Uh, well why are you making them sad? It's not hard to make them happy. Just be nice, funny and a gentleman|`|tbZNMfAsaa	how about shutting up?|`|3N5WDib3aa	just try to be considerate of thier feelings and when something is wrong then try to talk thorugh it and make it better with words. try your best not to get mad at her and just put yorself in her shoes and try to make her happy. maybe give her a hug or something. hope this helps you a little :)|`|AA11181101	lol pretty hard to juggle six cut the number down a bit and then u can deal with each issue as it comes not all issues at once|`|xJlw3AB4aa	LOL ok first your going to break all of there hearts bc your cheating on them and ur a jackcrap idiot ^_^ |`|11z4SUaNaa	Well if you're a newbie in relationship you should definately start with one girl at a time and STICK to one girl at a time. Not even superman can have 6 girlfriends and make them ALL happy.|`|2vidb5ZAaa	WELL<br>  lets see here<br>  FIRST OF ALL<br>  the # 1 problem here is<br>  YOU HAVE FRIKKKIN "6 GIRLFRIENDS"<br>  <br>  kay<br>  dat is your problem<br>  <br>  You can fix this by choosing just one.<br>  <br>  yeah.<br>  <br>  good luck with that.|`|0tGXQQ1zaa	Like, six girlfriends, as in dating, at once? |`|ZQiVNQoCaa	if you cant get & juggle 6 girls like u claim 2 do you know what 2 do|`|de06282eb6c9f58c0eb313bc3dd0ff08aa	6= your  stooopid   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|oi26HZsfaa	I think that... juggling six unhappy girlfriends at the same time is not healthy.|`|t6BiGUNSaa	Wow......u never said a guy can't critecize you...wow you man ho. 6??? no wonder your asking how to make them happy. Well break up with your bottom 5.|`|XqfH76PMaa	Try having just one and then you won't have so many problems.|`|OaWvsJ6Taa	I'm sorry...Well, not really, but six girlfriends is so uncool, and will only make them cry and hate you more. You have a choice-<br>  <br>  1. Keep one girl, and let all five take their pitchforks and start a mob, then the current girl finds out and joins the mob, too.<br>  2. Let all six girls hate you, go find a new girl, let them hate you more.<br>  3. Take a break from dating. Better than tears!<br>  4. Move to Alaska.<br>  5. Become a girl with a potion, go for a guy.<br>  6. Tell all six girls the truth- Let them hate you, but in some way, they'll fight over you...No guy has the courage for that.<br>  7. One way to make all of them stop crying, give them a twinkie. YAY!<br>  <br>  ...Well, you got a problem, so I gave ya GREAT solutions...Have fun with that!|`|ybecQ8QUaa	6 girls? Like 6 friend-girls or girlfriends?But If they are all your "girlfriends" and they all know then your in Big trouble!! lol<br>  If one is your "girlfriend" and the rest are friend-girls" then just treat your girlfriend with more seriousness. Also to your girlfriend you should be caring, soft, relaxed, happy, truthfully, but also be a rock, a shoulder to cry on...for her only. <br>  <br>   As for the other girls you just need to not be so affectionate, and Do Not ignore them. Then you'll have, big girl drama! <br>  <br>  kay? Good Luck |`|941f77f3e0d2a1ac414c522bab3ce1efaa	well first, maybe you should drop some of those girlfriends. Maybe you should be interested in trying to handle one girl at a time especially if your just starting out... and that just sounds like a huge mistake waiting to happen with all those girls. For that girl that crys all the time... just being there for a shoulder to cry on and to listen to makes them happy... maybe she has some major issues she's dealing with right now...|`|o37slzW4aa	Yea, I bet you have 6 girlfriends........  you sure you aren't stalking these girls, and they are cryin cause you wont leave them alone? Jus jokin with ya ;)... You can make us happy by makin a lot of money, being very clean (remember cleanliness is next to godliness), using deodorant, brushing and flossing your teeth, takin us out and spending your money on us, not bein a cheapskate, EMPLOYMENT is just great.  I say if you do these things your GIRLS will be happy. Oh yea, if you can learn the language and speak very clearly this will make your girls very happy, too.  Nothing makes us girls happier than to be able to communicate properly with our man :)!  Good Luck Darlin!|`|UngCqDfXaa	whoa...whoa...wait...you are new at this and you have 6 girlfriends? that is probably your first problem (and you will probably get that from all the girls who reply hehe) if they know about each other, they probably don't feel special...girls like to be their man's world...but to make them happy, make a romantic gesture...like cooking a candlelight dinner...bringing them flowers/chocolate...the clique stuff is always a good choice when in doubt, but if you can be creative...that is probably a better idea...a friend asked a girl to prom through a series of cookies delivered to her...the message written with icing..it was cute...but be genuine...that is the main thing :-)|`|WPL5nDivaa	could she possibly be depressed cuz her guy thinks 5 other girls are just as important as she is????<br>  come on dumbass, be logical with this, being cheated on does not make girls happy, what makes girls happy is a guy who treats them better then any other girl and likes only them.<br>  <br>  you need some serious help<br>  how old are u!!??|`|Jq4TdGShaa	first off all only 1 gf buddy more than one thats called cheating <br>  and next pick the girl that makes u feel good when u see her or hear her voice ect. and tell her u lover and only her <br>  (only if u do dont lie to her)|`|3DHObICuaa	She is probably crying because you have 5 other girlfriends.|`|KxGe9tJHaa	Monogamy makes girls happy.|`|Gh1x5xJvaa	Well, you don't seem like a newbie at relationships.  <br>  You shouldn't have six girlfriends.|`|2nxIx6Vyaa	ur a jerk!!!!!! u player! player! player! girls despise u now!<br>  please answer mine somebody!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081114211120AAmom8t&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|LJSffjK6aa	u dont no how to handle girls?? try not datin 6 of em at 1 time. how insecure r u!|`|c46ef35a193ae73fd3fd1140349d463daa	Mormon, eh?|`|Pf0K0CWjaa	okay wow.  why r u special?<br>  <br>  1.  break up with ur least fave 5<br>  2.  be nice and act like she is SPECIAL|`|53R43zLGaa	maybe it would be easier if u had one girlfriend|`|b6G7eLiUaa	so, whats your question? I don't even know what is going on. Talk English!|`|1EjOLsnnaa	First of all retard 1 girlfriend is enough to handle. Gee I wonder why the are so upset! Girls talk ALOT. They probably realised you where cheating! Jerk! P.S Im a girl and thats how I would feel|`|7r0eAV4Gaa	Well first off.... Dump 5. 6 girls is too much. Figure out which girl you are happiest with and want to see where things go. Then focus on learning what she likes and what makes her happy.|`|kZEsCPXfaa	6 girlfriends? <br>  DUDE! Its like having a f**** baby!<br>  PLA-YA!|`|oHX8rA2Saa	WHY WOULD YOU HAVE 6 GIRLFRIENDS??<br>  maybe thats why the poor girl always crys.<br>  |`|54iJxgexaa	try not to get mad, control your temper<br>  be generous<br>  treat them nicelyy|`|vhfIEt0gaa	Jeeze i wonder why your having problems with six girlfriends...|`|3y6TpeR8aa	you have six girlfriends zt once?
1ayfDeaoaa	No, not legally. If his mom wants him back and the police can find him, he can get into HUGE trouble.|`|810gI0xeaa	give it up... theres more people out there.. no need to go threw all that at such a young age.. learn how to love and care about a person first...|`|XqfH76PMaa	Not unless he is with a parent or guardian.|`|PwrCbS0Raa	once 16, he has to legal obligation to his parents, so yes
qNMfaJ4Raa	I'd probably dump a big bucket of cold water on my husband if he laid on the couch all day.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	You are preachin to the choir sister!<br>  <br>  My husband gets laid off every winter and does jack of sh*t the whole time.<br>  <br>  As far as I'm concerned, he's home THAT is his job.  I don't do it.  I don't clean, I don't cook, I don't do crap.  I work he stays home.  Not that hard to figure out.  The best is when he actually gives in to assume his role as the house husband.  Usually by then HE is so far behind that I can really see the defeat in his eyes.....lol|`|1k7LIZVWaa	My husband works hard.  We clean the house together.  I do one room and he does another.  Sometimes we meet in the bedroom and have a little fun and then clean that room last.|`|AA11990465	My husband is laid off from work as well, but he does help me with the household chores. When the chores are all done, though, he's either on the couch watching Home Improvement reruns or playing poker online. |`|CApnEZ83aa	My husband never lays on the couch.  Even on the weekend.  He's a workaholic.  I always clean with my other half home.  He has an office out of our house.|`|taUv5iaraa	I do not think my husband knows how to sit still. For some parts of the year he is in camp and for the rest of the year he works a regular 9 to 5 type shift. When he is home or laid off he doesn't sit still he usually wakes up in the morning on his days off has a cup of coffee then runs out to his shop to do what ever. As for cleaning he usually helps me clean up the supper dishes and sweeps the floors.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I am lucky enough that my husband works 16 hours a day and is rarely here to lay on the couch!  lol<br>  <br>  When he was laid off, he went nuts running around the house.  He can not stand to not be active.<br>  <br>  And no, I can not clean when he is at home.  Either he is in the middle of everything and driving me crazy or he is complaining and driving me crazy!  <br>  |`|RHux2Fmnaa	No. My husband's almost never home, except on weekends.  Leaves home early and comes back -sometimes- late at night; either that, or he's away on business trips.  But, my ex used to stay home all day and lay on the couch asking me to get him this and that, while I cleaned house, and it did drive me crazy.  So I know what you're talking about. |`|ncWV2FwLaa	my husband works i stay home.sometimes i get tired of doing the dishes and he will,some times he cooks,and if i don't feel like cooking we eat out.he doesn't lay on the couch any more than i do.and he even helps me with the clothes when i get them out of the dryer.when my husband gets laid off he gets another job that day.he doesn't like to lay around it drives him nuts,and he drives me nuts.lol|`|0lumiEweaa	i do all the cleaning and i serve Him.  Its our relationship.  i surrendered my self to Him before we married.  i am real happy this way and i believe He is, too.  <br>  <br>  i have since discovered that there are some females that feel the same way.  This sure isn't for most people, but when two people find a way that pleases them both, it should be ok. <br>  <br>  You can call me a slavegirl and such (i actually do kneel down to Him).  i know that i feel loved and appreciated for all my hard work.  i'm never beaten or abused or deprived of what i need.  The five years we've been married have been the only happy years i've had as an adult (i'm 38).   i am very happy and i love Him with all my heart.  <br>  <br>  i can clean the house when He's there because He will order me to do it, and i will bow down and say, yes Sir, and i will do it.  With a smile. |`|qL15Bojvaa	Where do women FIND these losers?<br>  <br>  <br>  Then they marry them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Un-f*cking-bee-leeve-a-bull.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why the thumbs down?<br>  <br>  You married him. No one had a gun to your head. Bet you've popped out a few kids for Mr. Self Motivated, too, huh?<br>  <br>  Enjoy your personal hell for the next 5 decades.|`|Gqxsyh5Kaa	I don't know if you really need to promise.  I can indeed clean when he's home since he does most of it.  He's got the OCD that way. |`|e2v1H1ATaa	well my fiance never just sits on the couch he is a very active person and he is usually running around with his kid or just doing something|`|p0ciSNYGaa	My wife would do that i would be at work and she would do nothin but set there and watch TV let everything pile up then whine and cry because i wouldnt help her cleanup i would finally wind up doing it i guess some ppl are just lazy but hell all i got to say is i love divorce papers|`|fsCbVlwCaa	hmmm yup my oh so wonderful lazy *** husband does lay on the couch whenever possible.  I used to complain, now I hope for a heart attack so I can collect the insurance money and get a new couch|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Mine is currently laid off also. (He will hopefully get back to work soon too)  And yes he is either on the couch or at the computer playing games.  I am working so yeah it kinda of gets under my nerves.  I mean he could do something with his time.  <br>  <br>  I don't know why it is, but no I can't do the type of cleaning with him hanging around that I can when he is out of the house.  Don't know why, but he just gets in my way.<br>  Red.

pPgyd4xvaa	Honestly if you already know that the other guy is just a fling and you even gave it enough thought to possibly wait for the Iraq guy. I would wait but it depends on what type of relationship you’re looking for. |`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	I would wait for Iraq guy !
