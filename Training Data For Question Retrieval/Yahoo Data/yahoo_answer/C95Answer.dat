He is like Jimmy Carter (also a 1 term president) - an economic disaster!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Sorry but were you asleep during civics class and during the election?

Do not have to be in a row though.|`|1AgD0dsBaa	After FDR passed away in office in 1945 Congress and the Senate put Term limitations on the Presidency for 2 Terms in office only. This was established by our first President(GW) after his second term came to an end GW stated that this is a democracy not an Autocracy like England. Congress and the Senate used this as the standard norm to cap the Presidential Office. Also just a tid note(GW) declined to run for a third term. Every President who ran for consecutive terms only served two terms as the President. When GW was asked should they State His Excellency the President. GW replied Mr. President is fine. Hence MR. President is not his Majesty or his Excellency. Wow its amazing what the founding fathers new about the future of political corruption with the Constitution. Probably some of the greatest minds in Philosophy and Ethics to form a government that is still an Enigma in the world today.|`|3755f813b1d516d25ce2a6e43bcf7a9daa	A president can serve up to 10 years. So if he takes over as a VP with less than 2 years left in the first president's term he can get elected twice.<br>  In Obama's case he can get elected to another 4-year term. It doesn't necessarily have to be 2012. If he lost then he could run in 2016. Bottom line is you can only be elected to 2 four-year terms.|`|AA10344737	Before FDR became president, a man could run as many times as he wanted.  Then FDR was elected for four terms and deemed that it just wasn't right (goes along the idea of a monarchy where the ruling queen/king rule for their whole life, which, is too much power for any one person to hold). It then became that a person can only hold two terms (which do not have to be consecutive.  Meaning, Obama can take a break and say in 2020 run again for his second term if he Truly desired.|`|I0TOw1KSaa	No, it's in the Constitution now that you can only serve two terms as President.  It used to only be a suggestion, set by George Washington, but after Franklin Roosevelt served 4 terms, it was made a law.  <br>  <br>  This is something you should be required to know before you're allowed to vote.

But experience is no guarantee of good judgment. And Biden has been wrong on almost every key issue. <br>  <br>  * In 1979, he shared Carter's starry-eyed belief that the fall of the shah in Iran and the advent of the ayatollahs represented progress for human rights. Throughout the hostage crisis, as US diplomats were daily paraded blindfolded in front of television cameras and threatened with execution, he opposed strong action against the terrorist mullahs and preached dialogue. <br>  <br>  * Throughout the 1980s. Biden opposed President Ronald Reagan's proactive policy against the Soviet Union. Biden was all for détente - which, in practice, meant Western subsidies that would have enabled the moribund USSR to cling to life and continue doing mischief. <br>  <br>  * In 1990, Biden found it difficult to support President George Bush's decision to use force to kick Saddam Hussein's army of occupation out of Kuwait. <br>  <br>  * A decade-plus later, the senator did vote for the liberation of Iraq from Saddamite tyranny. But as soon as terrorists started challenging the new democratic system in Iraq, he switched sides and became a critic of the whole war effort. He claimed that the Iraq war was lost and suggested that the US partition the newly liberated country into three or more mini-states. <br>  <br>  Biden's misreading of the situation in Iraq shows that experience is no substitute for judgment. He judged the situation on the basis of headlines and CNN footage - not the long-term, geo-strategic interests of the United States. In short, he lacked what President Harry Truman called "strategic patience." <br>  <br>  * For more than a decade, Biden has adopted an ambivalent attitude towards the Islamic Republic in Tehran, now emerging as the chief challenger to US interests in the Middle East. Biden's links with pro-Tehran lobbies in the US and his support for "unconditional dialogue" with the mullahs echo Obama's own wrong-headed promise to circumvent the current multilateral efforts by seeking direct US-Iran talks, excluding the Europeans as well as Russia and China. <br>  <br>  Had Biden had his way, "the Evil Empire" would still be around and Saddam Hussein still in power. The US would still be begging the mullahs of Tehran for forgiveness of unspecified "past sins" - and more American hostages would be seized in the Middle East while the mullahs celebrate their first atomic bombs. <br>  <br>  By choosing Biden, Obama, the candidate of hope, has transformed his promise of change, into a back-to-the-future pirouette - back to Jimmy Carter.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Sorry, Cheney has that one covered.<br>  <br>  Biden is very eccentric, there is no doubt about that.

This overconfidence had several effects:<br>  <br>  - The previous administration believed that a laissez-faire approach to commerce would make it self-stabilizing, repeating the error of the Hoover administration.<br>  <br>  - The building problem of predatory mortgage lending could not be addressed, although most state governments tried, because the administration took court action to prevent regulation at the state level.<br>  <br>  - The ongoing Republican fantasy life, in which all tax cuts pay for themselves (whether designed properly to do so or not), dominated administration thinking to the exclusion of reality.<br>  <br>  - Life got worse for most people, and the Bush administration celebrated economic success because life got better for the few who profited from their regressive taxation and borrow-and-spend policies.<br>  <br>  It's probably true that President Obama (who has actually been in office only 37 days) is playing a "low expectations" political game. However, in the presence of unrealistic confidence in measures that don't work, that also constitutes talking sense.|`|IngripgMaa	Um, no.  He's only been in term for about 100 days.  Blame the idiot that occupied that position for the last 8 years.
gasquENMaa	Hello Jon. Basically, they are going to ask several questions dealing with general security issues just to see where your head and mind is at.  You see a fight between two inmates but 10 more are standing around and watching. What do you do? What they are looking for is NOT John Wayne. You don't go barging in by yourself with a big red "S" on your chest to break it up. The riot in Lucasville in Ohio in 1992 was started when this exact circumstance happened and the charging Officer was taken hostage by 12 inmates. You call for backup, yell for the inmates to break it up, watch the perimeter while backup is enroute and when several other Officers are there, you ALL break the fight up and secure your area.<br>  <br>  You walk into a sallyport where you have a view of two ranges. On the left range, you see an inmate lying face down with a large puddle of blood around him. You look to the right and see two inmates beating the living daylights out of each other. What do you do? You radio for other Officers and a medical team and go see about the inmate lying in a puddle of blood. You know the other two are alive, they are fighting. You don't know if the one on the ground is even breathing. Assess that situation while help is enroute and then deal with the fighters with backup.<br>  <br>  You are working at the seg desk in the hole. Two Officers bring in an inmate who was just in a fight with another Officer, causing the Officer to be taken by ambulance to a local hospital. You don't know how bad the Officer was beaten. As the inmate is being locked in a strip out cage and is still handcuffed behind his back, the two Officers escorting him decide to teach him not to attack staff and give a righteous azzwhooping with hands and sticks. You are a witness to the entire event. What do you do? <br>  <br>  The proper answer ( and only legal answer) is to attempt to stop the beating and file an incident report while you report this to the shift Captain. ( I want you to understand that these questions are from management and they are only interested in seeing how you see legal issues inside the wire). I am not saying that you went to the bathroom during this and never saw it at all. Captains and Leiutenants will be asking these questions and you need to think like they will. No one is above the law and your answers need to be thought of in this manner. <br>  <br>  The main point of these questions is to see HOW you think. Are you a team player? Are you trying to be above the law? Are you a "cowboy" who will present a clear and present danger to your other Officers by antagonizing inmates or provoking them? This is a weeding out process. Think like management, go by the book and you should do well.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I do hope this is useful to you|`|av36HJ5Vaa	No idea, but Im hoping to do that when I graduate.<br>  <br>  I'm, thinking it will probably be more or less if you have any physical disabilities, and background information like always.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, just think of it like a conversation =]
AA11209233	Two things.  First, he can get his phone records to prove the phone wasn't in use at that time.  Second, he needs to get the other cop to appear as a witness or sign an affidavit, or else his statement is heresay.  The cop who ticketed your friend didn't witness any cell phone use, so he needs to produce evidence that it happened--the other cop has to officially state that it happened.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Show a detailed billing statement from your cell phone provider, showing no calls were made during the time period in question.|`|EbsekS7yaa	refer to the call log on the billing statement<br>  <br>  <What if they say that it could have been different phone?><br>  <br>  The state has the burden of proof.|`|AA12314337	Call the phone company for a record of the calls.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Yes.  He should go to the judge and tell his side of the story.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	go to the history on the phone or get the vids from the stop lights|`|eceLQUj5aa	What's the call history show? Does it show that the phone was in use in the minutes/seconds before he was pulled over.<br>  <br>  Don't forget, just deleting it from you phone won't protect him if he's lying. The courts have access to his phone records too.|`|AA11089066	He can print the history of calls made from the phone companies website.  They log all calls so they can charge you accordingly.  You may also have the phone company send you a copy of the call log.  Since a internet print out may not be accepted in traffic court.|`|9xE1baFnaa	There should be a time listed on the ticket when the cop pulled him over. Get the phone company to send a print out of all incoming and outgoing calls. If there is no time relevant to the ticket he should be fine.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Get a copy of the cell records.  They have the times when it was in use.  If it wasn't being used when he was driving, then he'd get out of it.|`|FaB2v37Aaa	Ummm the cell phone bill shows times and duration of all calls you make.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	wow, we don't have that law in kentucky. I am sooooo incredibly grateful that i can talk and drive all i want without getting pulled over!!|`|gWlmU1KJaa	call logs, from the billing compnay<br>  <br>  will show activity|`|zKoNElg7aa	I agree with the TEEK guy or whatever. The company should be able to send you calling history free of charge.|`|fZY7VHnEaa	get proof of where the person left from (alibi) and what time they left and then get proof of what time they got to their destination. and then you can check the history on the phone (how long between each call. if your friend was on the phone between those times then they are lying and if they werent you got a dirty cop.... hope i helped!|`|B3H7HIFGaa	print out a record of his phone calls and show the judge the time frame in which the cop claims he was talking on his cell, and if theres nothing in that time range, the ticket should be taken away|`|eF8QOIddaa	Just use blootooth in the ear the popo cant see and when your bill comes how do they no tha time you were drivin
ST6uEAJQaa	Sweetie, whether you have green CAR or red car has no bearing on your immigration matter, likewise change in your marital status since coming to U.S. should not affect your immigration statuses in any way, since you were not married in U.S.|`|WPWIiTFZaa	www.uscis.gov
LGidAYDwaa	That bit about taxes above, plus subsidization of the tobacco farming industry (protected by US Senators), and people would just do what they did in prohibition, when alcohol was outlawed: make their own and hide so they can smoke them. Basically, making smoking illegal would take money away from the government and put it in the hands of the mob (most likely) or any other group that decides to make a profit by taking advantage of addicts.|`|AA11065140	Because, as we saw with the prohibition of alcohol, making it illegal would simply add to the overall crime rate.  People would still smoke, but they'd steal to get their cigarettes.  There would also be a huge black market for them, which leads straight back to organized crime.|`|ucYwexwJaa	Hello, where do you live?  It IS legal in the United States.|`|LyVjJ0ylaa	To pay for Obama's health care programs.|`|AA11346438	because it's a free country|`|zFgYaQ5Jaa	Depends on what you're smoking. Cigerattes taste horrible and are bad for you.<br>  <br>   Now, weed on the other hand has a different story. There is a reason why it isn't Legal in America, and you want to know what it is? Its because the government can't tax weed, and weed seems to be rather popular. If the government could tax it it'd be legal then. Now, Weed is used on Anorexia patients to help create an appetite, as well as that its used to help relieve stress. That is a reason why you see some intellectual people smoking it, it relieves them. <br>  <br>   Weed is good for you, believe it for not.<br>  <br>   Cigarettes on the other hand aren't. They leave your voice raspy, they taste horrible, and they have an awful smell.|`|2yOXIkNQaa	because it causes other people death when they didnt smoke. it can also make people sick because if a kid gets a hold of it and smokes one they could get very sick. people with athsma can also be effected by it, if someone is smocking around them they could have an athsma attack and be put in the hospital or die.|`|btKmCOiiaa	Though I don't think it should be allowed, if smoking cigarrettes was made illegal, a lot of people would be out of jobs. Tobacco is a huuuuge industry, and has been for a while. That's why it's still legal.|`|XqpRYh52aa	Because governments collect billions in taxes every year.<br>  Why do you think they haven't banned it completely?
HaviqgZjaa	I assume this was prosecuted as a case of "joint enterprise", which describes a situation where two or more people embark on a joint criminal plan, but one of them then goes on to commit a further offence which is either within the scope of the original plan, or a foreseeable consequence of it.  That is where the line is drawn.  So Richardson was involved in the plan for her boyfriend to commit a violent attack on the victim, a foreseeable consequence of which was that the boyfriend may kill him.  <br>  <br>  The authority for the law on joint enterpise is the case R v Powell and English (1999) 1 AC 1.  The following wikipedia entry (see section 3, "when the outcome is death") describes this law in more detail: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_purpose" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_purp...</a>|`|AA11206283	She conspired in a crime that lead to a death.<br>  <br>  Sounds about right to me.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	She looks like a meth head, and he doesn't look any better. I'd give them both life in prison.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	She called him to the store, she pointed out the victim, he hit the victim, victim died.  The fact she pointed to a DIFFERENT victim is irrelevant, she wanted somebody hit, and the hit resulted in death.  You have to realize, she didn't just turn to her boyfriend and say 'that man yelled at me!".  No, she called him and presumably told him to come into the store and 'deal with it', then pointed to a victim. <br>  <br>  Yes, that is the definition of manslaughter.  It actually borders on murder, but in the UK, manslaughter definitely applies.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	For her to become so upset over a man pointing out she had pushed in the queue illustrates her short fuse mentality and she was determined to reap her revenge by calling her thug of a boyfriend. This pair of cretins were a disaster waiting to happen. I only hope that scum like them receive a very long prison sentence. She was culpable she obviousley knew her boyfriend is a violent thug who would sort the man out. Sadly a very nice, harmless family man died as a result of scum venting their intolerance through violence. I have often said to someone who pushes to the front of a queue, "excuse me I was before you" have you not done that?? would you deserve to be killed for doing it ? would you defend the person who called their friend to sort you out ?? I DONT THINK SO !!!|`|eHUXcYZhaa	I don't understand it either. How was she supposed to know that her boyfriend was going to attack him? She didn't know it would result in death either.|`|a0YeSoBEaa	inciting someone to commit a crime is worse than the crime committed|`|THNvhp3Caa	She solicited the act that caused the man's death.  You can't go around and have others beat victims at your behest, that's criminal behavior.  And since a death occurred because of her criminal behavior, she is responsible for that death.<br>  <br>  Your additional comments go to her "intent" and that of the boyfriend.  Lacking the specific intent to cause the man's death (murder), they were found guilty of the lesser crime manslaughter.  Didn't mean to kill him, but certainly didn't care that they might.  If you care, you don't hit in the first place.|`|OIDejLJXaa	In law, someone who solicits a violent act is viewed as being equally guilty of that act, as the person who commits it.<br>  <br>  So, if you pay a hitman to kill someone, you are guilty of murder.<br>  <br>  She called her boyfriend to attack a man, who she claimed, had pushed in line. When he did as she as asked, it resulted in the man's death.<br>  <br>  He pleaded guilty to manslaughter, she is viewed as equally guilty.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Her actions resulted in the death of an innocent man ,what on earth were they thinking about walking into a shop and just hitting out at some one that is not behaviour in civilised society,I am just sorry the charge was not  murder these two need locked away for life to protect Innocent people|`|OLHiZ045aa	Her actions resulted in someone's death. That's why.<br>  <br>  Stupid cow deserves everything she gets. How pathetic do you have to be to call your boyfriend cos someone's queue jumped.|`|KsMLHzbzaa	her actions lead to his death. involuntarily.|`|YCAUEpGCaa	Dunno|`|AA11376570	cos she incited the attack on a poor Innocent guy wit kids|`|rmaotgXhaa	Her actions caused her bf to strike the man who died
5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Look up some of the things they did to their victims.  Look up the 'medical experiments', and the horrible living conditions they subjected those people to. Just because you're old doesn't mean that you're untouchable, especially when the crimes you've committed are so horrendous.  Even if you don't execute them, they need to be held publicly accountable for their actions. We complain about water boarding to get information out of terrorists, but some of us protect people who tortured and killed children. (Please note I don't agree with water boarding, but I just am amazed by some people's attitudes on this issue.)<br>  <br>  EDT: so some people think that because we can't find and prosecute all people who committed war crimes we should let those we know about go? That's what I call shallow. By that logic we shouldn't bother putting poor people who commit crimes in prison because a rich person can hire Johny Cockren (sp?) to represent them and get off. Our justice systems aren't perfect, but they're there for a reason. We need to work to fix the problems instead of being moral relativists and pardoning people who performed viva sections on children.|`|NsbGM74iaa	They should be gassed.|`|Yfjh3kBAaa	Just let them die in peace.  One man and some of his sick personal had the power to control an entire country, both morally and physically.  Some of these Nazi war criminals feel absolutely horrible for what they were forced to do, because if they didn't their families would have been terminated as well as themselves?  What would you have done if you were in their place at that time?  <br>  <br>  Let them die in peace.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	They never allowed their victims to die in peace at home in their beds after a long, full life. Why should they have the priviledge of that? They did nothing to deserve it.<br>  <br>  If you found the man that killed your family just for fun 50 years later, would you want him to get a pass? I doubt it.|`|wnWIxb9maa	Die in peace. By now most are so senile they don't know what day it is.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Yes.  Their victims are still dead, the Nazis should join them.|`|gc16g57Iaa	How about all the allied war criminals that NEVER got prosecuted? Instead of the allied officers who raped civilian women in front of their families, we worry about the petty officer who was doing paperwork in a nazi party office. Get the irony?|`|WUUXLvdnaa	youll never be able to prosecute them. they are all over the world. most are already dead. just let it go. most bad people are never convicted. thats reality. what do you think would happen if we tried to convict u.s. soldiers of murder during the viet nam war?|`|4lQ5AuUcaa	No their medals should be presented to them at the white house like everyone else.|`|Pd9hGj5Baa	No. They should die in peace and be forgiven.|`|378838a44c6cfeeb4333c3cb60112801aa	Yes
QZicQ0kuaa	The Democrats fought tooth and nail for Franklin Raines at Fannie mae and in doing so thwarted the reforms that the Democrats blamed on Republicans. Shameful how the Left manipulated that, and how the media let them. I am afraid that it's way too late for this country to rebound to it's former self because these Democrats are revealing their true selves. They honestly believe that they have all the solutions and they are going to take as much money as they can from those who don't vote for them, anyway. They do it in Upstate NY where I live. Take every discretionary cent from business owners like me so I cannot spend or hire, and hand it to public unions who elect them. The poor get nailed in that scenario. No jobs because they took the Capital out of the economy. They are wrong and arrogant enough to not see it. The poor are fine with a check because they don't know any better. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://mises.org:80/story/3353" rel="nofollow">http://mises.org:80/story/3353</a>|`|pYRZcfsJaa	Because the Republican's can do very little to stop him and (for now) the media is still mostly on his side.<br>  <br>  and the dems are wanting a one party system... like China|`|wbIEau0qaa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Lie: the USA is contributing $1 billion to Hamas.<br>  Truth: It will take almost $3 billion to rebuild Gaza, and the USA pledged $900 million to help with reconstruction.|`|4nmLPk44aa	Because the so called men who run this nation are just that, so called no one has any guts any more, they sure don't grow them like they used to, most are too coddled by mommies now a day!!!|`|0zdt6udlaa	Becuase nobody can criticise him without being called a racist.|`|oTAPazvcaa	First off Bud, I love the name.

But this is how, traditionally, our country has stemmed depressions.  When FDR took office, we saw the government expand in ways that, until then, people hadn't even thought of.  You may have heard that you have to "spend money to make money."  If that's what it takes to have a solvent future and a functioning education system, fine.  Tax me.  I'm not so selfish as to think I can take it with me.  <br>  <br>  What would you think if Obama used federal monies to pay Americans to plant pine trees in nice, straight rows all across the country?  That's one of the New Deal policies that probably seemed superfluous at the time, but you cannot deny that the nation's GDP rose significantly as a result of this spending.  <br>  <br>  There is no "Savior."  That's a lie that America (and the Western world in general) would be wise to grow up and recognise as false.  No one honestly thinks Obama is actually the 2nd coming of Christ.  However, there are certain conservative Xian factions that think he's the Anti-Christ, and that's just plain stupid.  <br>  <br>  Whether he promised to get us out of Iraq or not, Bush agreed to an 18-month withdrawal plan.  Regardless of this, however, the Iraqi government doesn't want us there, and is right now drawing up legislation to ask us to leave.  <br>  <br>  Bush is hardly the one you want to compare Obama to.  Obama may give money to Hamas, but it pales in comparison to the support Bush gave to Israel, such as vetoing any UN resolution critical of their genocide against Palestine, and $7-14 billion a year in military and financial support.  You want to talk about the causes of Hamas terrorism?  How about Israeli bulldozers destroying whole towns so that immigrant Jews from Europe and New York can move in?  That's another whole can o' worms.

Burning oil pollutes our air and warms the planet.  We should get away from oil so that this stupidity stops.

So, we should go ahead and move towards alternative sources of energy, not only to prevent further environmental damage, but so that the US leads in the hugely important future industry of alternative energy.  Energy is always going to be big.  Why shouldn't America lead that future industry?  <br>  <br>  So, why wouldn't you support the push towards alternative energy?<br>  <br>  Do you not think that burning oil damages the environment?<br>  Do you think that damaging the environment is a problem?<br>  Do you think that there can be no viable source of energy other than oil?<br>  Do you think that America shouldn't lead the world economically?|`|c3vPZfghaa	because the only time right-wingers and exxon apologists make a big deal of it, is when oil prices are real high.<br>  guess what happens to the oil.<br>  It gets bought by the US tax payer at the higher price and kept in the strategic reserves, while the oil company owned refineries buy the oil that is cheaper to acquire from their parent companies that pay foreigners only $15 a day instead of Americans $20 an hour to drill it.<br>  <br>  Then when the price of oil comes down the oil refineries owned by the oil companies that stocked the strategic reserve at the higher price buy a larger portion of the oil for that cheaper price and then refine it just to sell it back to us.<br>  <br>  Its another money funnel.<br>  <br>  Any other time, when the prices  are low, we have plenty of oil being driled in this country.<br>  Isn't that funny?<br>  There was no shortage, only speculators driving prices up by dumping 64 billion USD into oil futures at the beginning of the Iraq war.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	I oppose it because whatever it costs it is buying a finite quantity of energy. Investing the same dollars into renewable and 'green' energy will buy way more because that is where our energy future lays. The environmental risk and short sighted pay off seems like a too high of a price for too little gain. Also, if they started today, it would be at least a couple of years before we could see anything actually flow into our energy supply whereas ethanol could be provided from crops (hemp preferred) planted this spring, harvested this summer and in tanks by fall.<br>  FYI: My 2000 Ford Ranger can be converted to pure ethanol without any hardware changes, in fact, most vehicles can be. older ones will need a carburetor rebuild to make it work but it will work.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	We already drill for oil in America.

Simpson was proven innocent on two counts of 187 PC, Murder.  <br>  <br>  Then retried for the same crime by calling it something different he was then found guilty of the new charge.<br>  <br>  Call it what we will today but this would have been double jeopardy earlier on and just because the prosecution did a lousy job of convicting Simpson.  The outcome of innocent would have stood based on the prosecutions poor deliverance of the facts.  failure to convince a jury with their case against him would have then ended.<br>  <br>  We have now resorted to a second chance for the prosecution to redeem them selves for doing a lousy job the first time by letting them come up with a new name for the same crime.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Double Jeopardy is necessary. Certainly sometimes a trial jury or a judge gets it wrong and a guilty man goes free. Evidence gets found later or he cops to it or something and that sucks.<br>  <br>  But what would happen if the DA ort the cops are SURE you did it. So sure that the DA tries you 7.... 8....10 times until he gets the verdict he wants. It invites the worst kind of abuse.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	It is a good policy.  If the government has a chance to try to prove that someone committed a crime and they are not able to prove it then the person will not have to spend the rest of their life worrying that the government is going to charge them again for that crime.<br>  <br>  Even OJ.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in class.|`|ucYwexwJaa	It prevents the police from doing shoddy work, or it's supposed to I should say.  I think it makes for more efficiency in the legal system also.|`|wnWIxb9maa	Hate it.  If they had their shot at you and you walk, suck itup and move on.|`|EJ8RZF7taa	Hey, I'm by no means an expert in law but I hope my opinion helps you out someway. I believe that is mainly a negative policy because if new evidence comes out about a "suspect who has already been tried in the court of law" then sadly the case will not be allowed to be tried again. Again, I am not an expert (so please no need to "flame me :P" and I'm sure that my answer is somewhat right yet drastically wrong because if it was completely right why is double jeopardy still in effect in today's American society? :P<br>  <br>  -As I thought people have proved me wrong and rightly so, Double jeopardy is I guess (for lack of a better analogy) a "double edged sword"|`|JvY5KL22aa	i loved the movie... but i like the idea of double jeopardy only if it follows the same story lines as the movie. I can't think of any other situation where double jeopardy would be needed.|`|4lQ5AuUcaa	it was some of Tommy Lee Jone's best work|`|AA11206283	Did this earlier today. Without it, you could run afoul of a DA who thinks you committed murder, who could drag you back to court for a murder trial over and over and over every time he finds a new fingerprint, until he convinces a jury where there is smoke, there must be fire; find you guilty and you spend the next 20 years appealing.
AA11206283	Go back to the clerk of the court in the county where the action took place.<br>  <br>  None of this explains the need for a certified true copy; which will be more expensive than just a trial abstract.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	Contact the clerk of the court in the county in which this court hearing took place.<br>  <br>  Some records involving juveniles are sealed and unavailable to the public.<br>  <br>  Some states allow destruction of records ten years after the conclusion of a case.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	Those type of cases are typically not available to the public, even to you as the child who was the subject of the case.<br>  <br>  If you know the county you might be able to get some of the information, but probably cannot get transcripts or anything like the pleadings or case study.<br>  <br>  If there was an appeal maybe you can go to the appeals court and find the opinion where some of the details might be discussed.  That might be hard to find since they are typically titled "In the interest of JDC" where the child's name might be John Doe Child, and do not ever use the child's name in the document.  <br>  <br>  Maybe if you mother appealed she would know, or have access to the appeals court case number and you could look up the opinion.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

That's impressive - and confusing on father's day.<br>  <br>  You can only sue the state if you can prove they have been negligient in collecting.  Just because the low life YOU chose to procreate with won't pay doesn't mean it's the state's fault.
q9PVawNyaa	Unfortunately the UN wasn't set up with civil conflict in mind and as such they are left pretty much powerless in situations were civil conflict is causing such problems.

Essentlially they could do nothing unless Rwanda asked them to do something.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Not much at all.|`|AA10667393	I take it you do not watch news programs and channels like CNN. Do your own research. As a hint, the UN sent in a special force to protect the Rwandans, but the rich countries (US, e.g.) failed to support them and they were eventually ordered out of Rwanda. The head of the protective forces refused to obey the order and stayed to save many lives, but were too few and too hamstrung by rules to do much. He was the subject of a special TV program you must have missed also.|`|EJ8RZF7taa	A good movie to watch about the genocide in Rwanda that includes allot of scenes on exactly what the UN did while they were helping is Hotel Rwanda, pretty popular movie, mild-strong violence, and strong language, use of drugs, etc. etc.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I can't remember what exactly they did, but it was one of two things: 1. a firmly worded non-binding resolution 2. nothing.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	They passed a resolution.

Of course, the name Area 51 never came from the government but was a public and media thing from the early 1940s when nuclear testing was being conducted in Nevada.<br>  The base is believed to be under the administrative supervision of Edwards Air Force Base.  There is even contracted flights that depart from Las Vegas airport everyday to Groom (unofficial/official name) carrying contractors and DoD personnel.  They are known as Janet flights and have a destination of "Station xx (various numbers)".<br>  <br>  As far as getting orders.  It's a detachment so I don't think you get orders there.  I think most are hand picked from around the country, especially the squadrons out of Nellis, Edwards, the weapons station etc. to work there for a period of time.<br>  <br>  DoD civilians, pretty much the same thing.  Contractors I suppose is much more strict and of course you don't get a job to that base.  You have to already be working for a company like Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, etc.<br>  <br>  Hell, there are satellite photos of the base all of the internet plus the perimiter fence which has signs (but never mentions it as a military base :)) that say to NOT cross or point any kind of recording devices in its direction.

Allow me to school you.<br>  <br>  The federal reserves job is to print money (Note- There is nothing federal about the federal reserve, it is a quasi-privately owned bank) that is what they do, they print money.  America buys the money from the federal reserve with government bond and must repay dollar for dollar plus interest and other fees ( keep in mind it cost appx. 1.4 cents to mint one penny ) Where do they get the money??? From taxes; or from "Borrowing from the future" if you are a liberal. As long as money is being printed, America will be in debt.  and what happens if the Federal reserve stops printing money???Deflation, what happens with deflation??there is a fall in how much the whole economy is willing to buy, and the going price for goods. Because the price of goods is falling, consumers have an incentive to delay purchases and consumption until prices fall further, which in turn reduces overall economic activity - contributing to the deflationary spiral.<br>  Since this idles capacity, investment also falls, leading to further reductions in aggregate demand. So what does the Government have to due to reduce this trend???  Issue more money, which in turn cases more debt and the cycle continues.|`|CvFajKPUaa	Congress controls spending not the president.  However, one of the best way to increase government revenue is to actually lower capital gains tax.  BO even acknowledged this but for some reason thinks its fair to punish people who create wealth and at the same time decrease government revenue.<br>  <br>  When people are able to keep more of their hard earned money they are able to use it to produce more wealth which leads to more jobs and a stronger overall economy.<br>  <br>  The last 8 years were spent paying the bills that came do from the previous 8.  The loans that were forced upon the mortgage industry to approve in the 90's finally fell apart in the last few years taking the economy with it since the real estate market is 25% of the US economy.<br>  <br>  A good way to help the deficit is to allow people to create wealth.  As people create wealth by not being punished with high taxes they are able to put more money back into the economy which then benefits the governments revenue.  Non of this matters if the government spends $1.4 trillion dollars on 8870 pork projects that do nothing but pay back the slim balls who bought our recent politicians their office.<br>  <br>  So it is every elected official to help the nations debt and not create more debt or economic time bombs that will explode a decode down the road.|`|53qG7lfLaa	Large Debt (deficit is what happens in a year).  And I would say that it depends on the economy.  If you can pay down the debt then it's probably a good idea.  But in certain circumstances there may be more important priorities.  Obama needs to stop blaming Bush for our economic woes every chance he gets because it doesnt' help anything, especially at this point.  Did Bush blame Clinton for 9/11?  No he didn't, even though he would have been more than justified in doing so, given that Clinton did almost nothing to fight terrorism and Al Qaeda.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	Yes, but he has made it worse.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It's your job to TRY to fix it.
u33x2hqzaa	I hear you about the problems predating Bush but he did inherit a record surplus and left us with a record deficit.  IMO he outright stole the 1st election and I have my doubts about the 2nd one as well with those Diabolic machines.  He got us into an immoral war based on sketchy (being generous here) intelligence.  He hid the war spending from the budget.  He gave tax cuts to the rich.  He used executive power to undermine Congress.  He gave wings to terrorism via Iraq, Gitmo and the non-American endorsement of torture.  And yes while the problems of the bubble now bursting were set in motion before his tenure, he made things worse via a costly and fruitless war & tax cuts which reduced money from our coffers and did not strengthen the economy as predicted.  All around he was a terrible President who actually made Clinton look good by comparison.  Not to disrespect you but I do have to wonder how a self-proclaimed "liberal anarchist" can come to the defense of Dubya.  Maybe I'm not the only one breaking into the cat nip? ;)|`|qQEl7Fukaa	Well there's the obvious reason. "Mr. Clinton doesn't work here anymore." isn't gonna get the job done. A big part of taking over a job is that you inherit all the problems and now it's your turn to fix things. You wanted to be President, so here ya go! <br>  Now things aren't always gonna get fixed no matter who is in the driver's seat, so ya gotta blame someone. If you're lucky enough to follow a President with a low approval rating, you're in like Flynn!|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Sorry, Charlie but you are WAY misinformed...the "uptick rule" was eliminated one month before the market crash (coincidence?

44AkhdRnaa	The word 'humanitarian'|`|Vv465eJMaa	Miltary intervention is killing people using weapons<br>  Humanitarian intervention is peacekeeping and to protect citizens from aggression<br>  Humanitarian intervention is not allowed under the UN charter (crazy) yet military is allowed,so genocide in Zimbabwe or Sudan by internal forces still means it is a strong enough reason to intervene.Instead you can bomb the living daylights if you say your own country is threatened or own citizens killed (hence blair/bush and their religious paranoia)|`|Xwg2BotRaa	Intervention refers to military action to influence the result of a conflict.  E.g. to prevent an invasion, or protect an ethnic minority who are getting persecuted.<br>  <br>  Humanitarian intervention refers to non-military action (although possibly using military forces) to deliver aid or assistance to people who need it, whether due to a conflict of for another reason such as a natural disaster.<br>  <br>  Gulf War 1 was an intervention, the US and many others intervened militarily to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  The UN action in Bosnia was humanitarian intervention, at least at first, since we were not attempting to end the conflict, but simple to feed refugees and protect them.  <br>  <br>  Can sometimes be a grey area, for example when you have to use force to ensure that aid is delivered or to protect refugees.|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	One word...money.

AA11156037	Yep, I had emergency surgery last year. Thank God for Insurance.  Funny thing, it takes 35% of my wife's monthly salary to pay the premiums and our deductibles, but I count myself luck.  I would probably still have a hole in my butt cheek the size of Manhattan if I were dependent on Universal Health care.<br>  <br>  The Hospital program/ insurance carrier that my wife worked for in Dallas had to reduce JOBS so they could fund (over $5M PA) the ILLEGALS and INDIGENTS to whom they are required to provide services.   Hey that was JUST what the Doctor ordered. <br>  <br>  Personally with my Cigar taxes escalating from the continuance and expansion of SHIP, I fail to see the need for Universal Health care.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, when I was AD USAF, the USAF/VA Medical center had a policy: AD G.I.s up front, Veterans next and then AD/ Vet dependents.  My dependent daughter got a concussion in a car accident, we waited 7 hours behind 3 drunken VETS. <br>  Yeah, the Vets deserved care but the TRIAGE system had its hands tied.  I see that happening over and over again.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	It won't be "on demand health care" as many people think.  You can go to the hospital but chances are you will be sent home for a few months because suddenly demand has swamped supply.

I would ask Canadians if they would rather have their system or ours.|`|XxUByikJaa	Like Medical Insurance is so great .

I take responsibility for my health even though I currently have great insurance, this was not the case while raising 2 children w/o it.  <br>  <br>  The medical community doesn't give a rats *** about you, they want you to stay sick and take their drugs so that they all make money.  If you want to get well then it is in YOUR hands to demand answers and treatment.<br>  <br>  If they schedule a procedure for 3 months from now then you just show up and demand to be seen.  It actually works, try it.  Universal Health Care is taking control and income away from the drug companies, HMO's-capitalistic bastards like Rumsfeld who got Nutrasweet approved by the FDA when there was NO head of the FDA, with NO testing and who also was involved with Montsanto, the  poisoner of hundreds of thousands of people here and in India.<br>  <br>  The ignorance of the American people is just astounding and I'm sure you are the same people who rail against the word "socialism", as if it is some sort of horrific state.  If you didn't already have socialism here, which is basically what fuels every government regulatory commission, transportation division, unemployment and land use protection, I could go on and on, we would all be in deep ****.

He has not committed high crimes or misdemeanors. Doing something that some members of the public disagree with is not a high crime or misdemeanor. If it was, Bush would have been thrown out in in '05.

Even if they start up a conversation on the subject.<br>  <br>  I am reminded of the actors Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart. Fonda was a Democrat and Stewart was a Republican.

Somehow the conversation got so heated that they came to blows. They were rolling around in the snow on the sidewalk in their fight and they both had a realization: They both cherished their friendship more than they did their politics. They felt silly getting physical over politicians they hardly even knew. So they both agreed that to keep their friendship intact, to not discuss politics in each others company. They kept that pledge and their friendship for the rest of their lives.

As far as I can tell, yes, he has broken a campaign promise or three. But what the people complaining about this apparently fail to realize is that he won't be able to keep every promise that he made. I didn't vote for him, mind, but I prefer complainers to have actual ammo to back up their complaints.<br>  <br>  Also, some are saying that he isn't an American citizen. If I recall, so far it's only being called into question; it's not official. Even then, it's not an impeachable offense. It just means that his term as President would be rescinded and then Biden would take over. We would, in a way, end up being governed by Obama anyway.|`|fccwpjGaaa	The people failed at Bush, and he committed worse things that Obama. do you think that Obama will be Impeached.|`|gc16g57Iaa	I've been wondering if many liberals are masochists...they seem to enjoy being lied to and abused.

If you go to 11, you still need a majority of 6, 13 you need 7, and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  Even the Justices know this.  That's why in majority of cases, one Justice writes the controlling opinion and the rest just sign off or perhaps add a short additional opinion.  The dissenting Judges also do the same.<br>  <br>  There are the rare occasions when Judges do feel compelled to write individual decisions for or against.<br>  <br>  So, it's a combination of "stare decisis," longstanding tradition, Constitutional mandate and good old fashioned "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."<br>  <br>  Additionally, do you think the Court is slow?  Adding Judges will surely slow it down further.  On the other hand, decreasing the number will pare it down to the number of Judges of the Lower Courts.  It will be very hard to argue that the opinion of say, 5 Lower Court Judges should be reviewed by 5 Supreme Court Judges.  What then?  Reduce the Lower Courts to 3?<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Supreme Court is not final because it's always right.

So where did that money come from. It came from people like you paying more for your auto insurance. If the gov. owned the agency instead of this man we would have someone doing his job for about $80,000 a year & you would pay less on your auto insurance. So why would you want to pay more for your auto insurance? The gov. is us. We are the people who make up the gov. Stop listening to the people who are spreading this BS. They own houses they don't live in while you are losing your house or someone else doesn't even have a house.Thanks to the constant energy of republicans chanting the word socialism they have created it more & more. They have no clue about what they are creating b/c they blame the dems but it is the reps. who put us where we are now. So to ask how to cut gov. now is really asking for the impossible. The business owners you put your faith in will do whatever gives them more money. So they sent jobs overseas. I would rather have the gov. create jobs & keep them here.EDIT: I just saw HotpinkKitty's answer & it came to mind that if we cared about the bottom level of people in our country we would not have so many people needing gov. for jobs. The military is in the news everyday. Isn't that gov. I have a neighbor who hates gov. meanwhile his wife is a teacher, his kids both work for the gov.

The government must do things on a smaller scale.  Usually anything the government touches turns corrupt and stops working properly.  I'm not for government intervention unless it's needed.  Right now, the government is trying to make the less fortunate people to always rely on them for their own welfare.  Social capitalism is capitalism under the ideal that one who creates, should give to those who take and use but never give things back.  We are in reality being overran by our own government.  But, the people choose this lifestyle.  Why burn wood or coal?  When I can get energy assistance...   I mean the more some people are self reliant, the more others are sick and blind to see through it all.  They like being pets fed by the beast.  I shall not sacrifice my freedoms in the name of security or government control.  Become self reliant, leave government to run it's own course, and shift the weight differently when needed to.  The less reliant people are on government, the less the government can run.  But with this there are the people that will always neglect themselves to the government and become submissive.  Those people can enjoy socialism.  I won't let it get to me.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Getting out of Iraq, no more no bid contracts to multinational corporations.

I would suggest trying a ride along if you are considering becoming a police officer. Call and see if there is any way you could sit in and see what each profession does on a day to day basis. This would really help you in making your decision, especially before you go through years of school and putting the money into it. Do your research and good luck!|`|b8svqAMAaa	I am a Deputy Sheriff.  Have been in Law Enforcement since 1995.  Started as a CHP officer in Los Angeles, hated it.  I decided that instead of just dealing with traffic all the time that I wanted to do real cop work (sorry chippies) so I quit for a bit.  From there I went in to gaming for the casinos in Nevada and worked surveillance catching cheaters and card counters.  Did that for a while before getting hired by a Sheriff's Department here in California.  Worked in the jail for a short time before getting tired of it and moving on to patrol.  I love my job and what I do, but the politics within the Department is for the birds.  That is the only part of this career that I am not happy with.  Good luck.|`|e06NRifuaa	I am going to school for law enforcement, ie i will probably be a cop that is what i want to do.

Obama and the Democrats are so quick to generalize all Republican thought as "failed policies of the last 8 years" that I doubt any of you are even listening....<br>  <br>  Oh, and you don't really need "new" ideas when there are ideas that have been proven to work. I guess a good question for you would be, why do the Democrats keep revamping old failed ideas, and claiming that they are new?|`|07ad7f1a558394efa73cf9e95d1d6fe8aa	We have plenty of ideas and real suggestions on how to make things better for all but as usual, the Democrats won't listen or even invite us to the table. So, when this socialist plan totally fails, we will sit back and say "told you so" but by then things will probably be too far down the toilet to save.

This is one of the reasons I like him. I think I was among the first to mention his name as a potential vice presidential running mate for Senator McCain.  But there's credence to the thought, "No, save him. Don't let him go down the tubes in this election. He's 36. Let him really fix this state up and so forth."

rvwYECIpaa	What type of diplomat do you want to become? Do you want to work for your country's foreign ministry (state department in the US), or do you want to work for an international organisation such as the UN, NATO, or OSCE? <br>  <br>  Either way, the knowledge of languages is not essential. It is the ABILITY to learn languages that they look for, and the graduate schemes of foreign ministries are very good at picking up on these things. However, existing knowledge of languages will do you no harm, and in some cases will do you well - especially with seconded jobs and specific regional postings.<br>  <br>  I would say that going through your foreign ministry's recruitment scheme will be very tough. You will require excellent numerical and verbal reasoning, excellent knowledge of international affairs and the ability to not fold under pressure. These types of recruitment schemes are TOUGH. You must be well prepared.<br>  <br>  Through an international organisation, the best way to do this would be by getting onto internships. You will be required to have at least 1-2 years experience in a relevant field to get on their payrolls. Try all the internships in relevant fields that you can find, take anything that you can get, work hard and make sure you create a good relationship with your supervisor to get a good reference. <br>  <br>  These are not as tough to get onto as, say, the state department, however, these positions require experience whereas the state department will go on the abilities they are able to assess rather than experience<br>  <br>  Additionally, you could go down another route. After having gained experience through internships and junior posts within international organisations, you could try and get a secondment through the state department. These are extremely well paid as both the state department will pay you, as well as the organisation you are working (board and lodging allowance, tax free salary etc.). <br>  <br>  These are hard to find though without any experience.<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to go for internships at the same time as taking the foreign ministry exams. If you fail the exams, go for the internships. <br>  <br>  Once you get an internship, your foot will be in the door. This really worked for me. On my first internship, within weeks I had already found avenues to other internships and got recommendations and pointers from my supervisors. This lead on to others, and slowly I gained experience until I could apply for a junior position, and worked my way up from there.<br>  <br>  Languages is not what you need to focus on. Make sure you get a good Master's degree and be prepared to work for a pittance for a couple of years on internships. You will be set up for a very well paid job , a great deal of job satisfaction and a stable future if you succeed.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	IMHO, you need tact and an ability to get along with lots of different people with lots of different agendas.<br>  <br>  Plus political connections. Very important.<br>  <br>  Many embassies have staffs filled with translators, which make the need for a diplomat to really know the language as well as s/he should know the political, social and economic structure of a country, though skill in speaking their language is  a plus as well.|`|AA11565538	Sorry, but that's the answer Chinese and Japanese.<br>  You can also learn Russian and Arabic (but there are many types of arabic languages).|`|1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	I agree that language is not the primary qualification but it certainly helps. If you don't want to learn an Asian language, then you've got most of the world covered, and if you want to add, I would suggest German and Arabic as the two most useful ones you don't have. Russian wouldn't hurt either.<br>  <br>  But as the other response says, being a great diplomat is about the ability to work with people, to gain their trust. So you want to understand them, to understand their motivations (politics and issues in particular). Study intercultural relations, history, political science, literature, psychology, negotiation theory. <br>  <br>  Since much international conflict comes from economic issues and trade, study those subjects: economics and international economics, trade policy, etc.<br>  <br>  And travel, meet people.<br>  <br>  But the fundamental skills of a great diplomat are probably things you are born with and can only sharpen with study.|`|2frMKpxEaa	portugesee(brazil and normal)<br>  all european languages is a good thing to know<br>  :)

You can join to be an officer if you are already an RN.<br>  <br>  The thing about seeing the world and traveling, is that you will, but none of it will be your choice.  As active duty we are given 30 days of vacation a year, so you might be able to travel that way as well as be able to afford it more.

The best advice I can give you would be to talk with a recruiter and tell them your plans, they can advise you better. Naturally they have several job classifications in the Army that are in the medical field, so you'll get tons of experience! Just be aware that there are several thousand troops in Afghanistan and you will more than likely be deployed there in a support role! You will be witness to some pretty gruesome injuries and deaths, if you can handle that it's for you.

You said you don't want to fight. OK, fine.<br>  <br>  Why then, of all the available Services, choose the Army especially at this time?<br>  <br>  Have you not seen any episodes of M*A*S*H ?  That's Army Medicine.<br>  <br>  Now, if you look to recent disasters, you may have seen just off to the horizon a big, white, hulking mass with a big giant red cross on it.  That's either the USNS COMFORT or the USNS MERCY.  These are hospital ships ran by the U.S. Navy.<br>  <br>  As the name implies, these are actual floating hospitals with operating rooms, wards, beds, doctors, dentists, nurses, technicians and laboratories.  Of course, it has helicopter capabilities.  And, unlike M*A*S*H units, they're away from the fighting (legally, they're immune from intentional hostile fire), they're clean, and, this is important, they're air conditioned.<br>  <br>  The Air Force will have their own unique approach to their Medical Services and it's quite possible to do your whole tour stateside.  To be fair, there's ways in ALL the services to do your whole tour stateside.  Those medical evacuation airplanes (where passengers'/patients' chairs all face the tail of the aircraft) are tended by the flying nurses of the U.S. Air Force.<br>  <br>  Being stateside does not preclude world travel.  Opportunities always exist requiring volunteers for temporary duty (less than 180 days) overseas.<br>  <br>  Due to very high demand and strict competition from civilian employers, all the Services will <br>  <br>  . . . wait . . . for . . . it . . .<br>  <br>  pay for your nursing degree.<br>  <br>  You choose the university.  <br>  <br>  They pay the tuition.<br>  <br>  You get a monthly stipend (currently $1200.00).<br>  <br>  Your service payback obligation is one-for-one.  That is, if they pay for 4 years of education, you owe four years of service, if they pay for 5, you owe 5 and so on.<br>  <br>  While we're on the subject, why limit yourself to Nursing?  The deal is similar for Dental School or for Medical School.<br>  <br>  That's the overview.<br>  <br>  Make contact with several Officer recruiters of all the Services.

K8qAniReaa	The Marines have some of the slowest promotions in the military because there are fewer spots and people are less likely to leave.  The Army has the fastest promotions in all of the branches in the military because there are more spots and lots of people leave.  Another major contributor to promotions is your MOS.  If you're in a critically undermanned MOS you'll get promoted very quickly.  But if you're in an overmanned MOS you'll be promoted rather slowly and you may even be forced to cross train to a different MOS just to stay in.<br>  <br>  The highest advanced rank you can get in the Marine Corps is E-2. That would make you a private first class.   If you want to start higher join the Army or any of the other branches.  In the Army an E-3 is also called private first class but that doesn't mean anything.  They are different rank so even though they may be called the same an Army private first class gets paid more than a Marine private first class and has more responsibility.|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	I believe the Army, mainly because (if I'm not mistaken) the Army is bigger than the Marines, thus, giving more opportunities to grow in there.|`|GXilXsghaa	Army.|`|MfZU1UpFaa	haha your a friggin pogue!!! ima 0311, only a  poolee, USMC|`|nlj7sk5uaa	Their about the same, it depends how hard you work when your in your rank.

Im a 0311, or im going to be a 0351, or a 0331....Thats my wish list, in order...My eventual goal in the MARINE Corps is to be a SDI (for all you pogues or ppl who don't know what that is, its a Senior Drill Instructor)|`|cCBwK2EGaa	Captain in the USMC, god I cant wait.<br>  <br>  -oh really.  well this pogue can tell you that training is going to be alot easier for you.  Good indicator if no scuz buckets it isn't training.  oh and ask about the night classes.  Lights out pt nothing beats it.
AA10123414	If it is that old it is unlikely they will be able to force you to pay it and it will be off your credit report soon, however you will always owe the money.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	Depends what type of debt it is, I collected Council Tax for 10 years and the debt never went away until paid, there was no time limit in collecting the debt.|`|wLacJx6Oaa	Debts are removed after 6 years from your credit reference file (6 years from day of default), contact the provider of the report to have it removed and your file amended.  <br>  If you are being harassed by the lender, look at the fact sheet I have attached a link to. <br>  Also, if they have not contacted you for over 6 years, the "Limitation Act 1980" would apply and that means they could not pursue the debt in court (2nd Link is to pdf doc with the act....section 2 on the first page is for you.....).<br>  Hope this helps, and I assume you are in the UK.....|`|us8isFmiaa	You posted this Q. in Law & Ethics. So ethically, as an honest person, if you aquired the debt, why would you ever *not* be required to pay it back?|`|6CU00J1Yaa	credit reports don't show departments.
HpSGw2Fiaa	Whoa.  Do your own homework, dude.  Don't rely on the answers you might get from any of the idiots in here...|`|f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	tell your parents i told you to do your own homework
AA10123414	An answer by a judge would be an opinionated answer, no one here has your case file.<br>  <br>  That said, it is unlikely you are going to jail tomorrow. the judge wants you to pay support, not sit in jail. You are making an effort as evidenced by what you have paid so far and have secured a job. Make sure you tell all of that to the judge.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	No one who does not know this particular judge can tell you if you are going to go to jail or not.<br>  <br>  Your lawyer likely is the best person to aks this of.<br>  <br>  If the judge is at all fair you probably won't go to jail. <br>  <br>  If this is the first time you got this far behind you probably won't go to jail.<br>  <br>  If you have been in this court before for this same failure to pay you might just go to jail.<br>  <br>  Likely you paid the lawyer more than $400., and if you had just paid the support you would have been current.  <br>  <br>  Are you still behind?  If it has been a month you now owe another month in addition to that you were behind before, so you might go to jail.<br>  <br>  Based on experience with these types of cases you won't go to jail unless there is a lot of information you left out here.<br>  <br>  And don't cry to the judge about how often you keep your kid overnight, you are supposed to love the child and want to take care of him.  If you try to cry to the judge about how unfair it is because the child is with you 2 nights per week you might just end up in jail.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

IuJjYz6gaa	Nope, that's not true.  However, if they are in the same command, and one is of a higher rank, it is against the rules.<br>  <br>  Now, technically it is not allowed for officers and enlisted to date, but it's okay for them to be married.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of anyone saying anything unless they are within the same command.|`|4eIXUy4paa	I don't know if the Air Force has different rules than the Army.  I'm in the Army, and you can have a relationship with someone of equal or similar rank, so long as the two of you are not in the same chain of command.  In other words, as long as they can't do each other favors, or show favoritism to their significant other over another soldier, they can date/marry whatever.  I wouldn't think the Air Force would be different, but maybe they are.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	Absolutely not true, the only caveat is that it is not allowed within the same chain of command
2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I've gone back and forth on this most of my life, and finally decided to look at the death penalty system in action.  A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|JthubNIsaa	It was reported that in the US, they are considering doing away with the death penalty because it costs too much to have it. Appeal process, etc.<br>  <br>  I do not support the death penalty but I do support hard labor camps out in the desert. Baloney sandwiches and water. No air conditioning,  no pillows, no computers, no TV, etc. If they die, they die. If they live, if they die.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	The trouble is that the death penalty is no deterrent. When a person commits a murder they don't expect to get caught. So if the death penalty is no deterrent, is it worth the risk of the miscarriages of justice that will occur?<br>  <br>  I don't mean might occur, I mean WILL OCCUR. They happen on a regular basis. If the state kills an innocent man, are the people who support his death any better than the murderers they are trying to punish?<br>  <br>  Second point, what is the purpose of killing someone who is a murderer? Punishment, Rehabilitation or revenge? You can <br>  punish a man much more effectively by keeping him alive and making him do hard labour for the rest of his life. You can't rehabilitate a dead man and our justice system is not based on revenge. It is about a rehabilitation, turning the criminal into a useful citizen again. We may not be particularly successful at it but it is what we aim for.|`|AA11409272	While I'm a proponent of the death penalty...I'm even more an opponent of any world-wide laws that cedes a nations soverignty to a world governing body|`|YHPYg7pWaa	Yes for some crimes such as the murder of a child and terrorism!|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	go hug a tree ya pinko commie bastard|`|12VQ4ETcaa	If the death penalty actually worked as a deterrent, then it would only have taken 2-3 executions max before death penalty crimes disappeared.  Word would get out and people would be too scared.  Obviously, since the death penalty has been around for decades and people still commit murder, it doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  Having a death penalty is very expensive, because people are allowed to appeal.  It would just be cheaper to give them a life sentence in the first place.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	it depends on whether you want vengeance or justice. if it is wrong for an individual or group to kill, then it is also wrong for the state to kill. in my experience people who support the death sentence want it for their own satisfaction not justice.|`|AA10377899	I think it should for some crimes, such as murder. In my opinion, punishment should match the crime wherever possible.|`|d752626a8e04d590b5de05ddff20f574aa	Yes I  totally agree and a strong  deterrent is needed.  A life for a life.|`|YSuc7L8taa	Yes, lets not feed and water this worthless trash!<br>  Great place to start with budget cuts. Crank up Old Sparky and run it 24/7 until we clear the plate.<br>  Think of the savings!|`|uAZlvHgiaa	I'm a supporter of the death penalty. Always think What if it was my family.|`|kCUT14ggaa	No totally disagree|`|PTtKKOP2aa	I agree with you. I would bring back the death penalty in a heartbeat..
48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	A felony??? *LOL*  <br>  <br>  Speeding is an infraction; even going over 100 mph is an infraction (but a more serious one). Fines are not set by dollar per mph; there is a 3-tiered schedule. The statewide bail schedule calls for a fine of around $435 for going 26+ mph over the limit.  You may not be offered traffic school, but if you are it will cost a bit more, but keep it off your record.|`|k56mmj2eaa	Anything over 20 Miles Per Hour is a felony and you could go to jail over that one. but if you are going to try to pay the fine it could get way up there like 600 dollars or more and you could loose your license for a year.|`|b8svqAMAaa	I believe it is somewhere around $12 for each mph over the speed limit that you were doing.. and by the way.. it is not a felony.  Had you been going 100mph or more, that would be a different story.
AA10123414	Well, even if there is not currently an order, it should be a big giant clue that they don't want to talk to you. If you keep harassing them sooner or later you will end up in jail. Move on.|`|RRFbDou9aa	I smell BS here; a cop wouldn't call.  In my state they have to physically serve you the papers and read them to you.  If someone called and just told you that I'd bet good money it wasn't a cop.<br>  <br>  Additionally, violating a protective order is a misdemeanor, not a felony ($10k bail is definitely in the felony range).  I think someone is lying to you.|`|5385f2aa192bffdaaa56b3912bf7e017aa	you could go to court and contest the order, but then the "friend" is going to come to court as well and tell the judge why they want it maintained, and you might not like to hear what they say or do.  And if there is any messages you left that the court can deem threatening, they will maintain the order.  Best bet is to let it go and forget about this person.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Yes, in most cases you can seriously get a no contact order from a court with little or no "real evidence" of harassment!  It's perfectly legal!<br>  <br>  You have been "put on notice" that your former friend no longer wants any contact with you.  I'd leave it at that and stay away!|`|a634fc83e8cc678200f372815e1d735daa	there is nothing that you can do,except NOT contact this person its obvious they don't want to be friends with you or speak with you,nothing you can do but let it go.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	You said it all NO CONTACT. And forget any friendship between the two of you.|`|AA10347782	Re-contact the police and ask them, if the "person you attempted to contact" had filed a harassment complaint against you, that lead to the "no contact order"?  If so, then move on. If not, ask them what lead to the "no contact order"|`|k56mmj2eaa	Granted no contact means just that. If I were you I would forget about that person and move on. you do not need that kind of headache there is no one worth going to jail over.|`|b8svqAMAaa	If this person has a restraining order against you that states that they do not want you to contact them then you have to be legally served with a copy of the order for it to be valid.  If the police tell you that you can't talk to someone, it doesn't really hold much value.  Of course, if they tell you that person does not want you contacting them and you continue, the police will type up a report on you for annoying or harassing this person.  I would just leave this person alone and catch the clue.
1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	Someone is sure to ask do you mean "gay" or "guy". Is this a same sex marriage under Massachusetts or Connecticut law?<br>  <br>  <br>  Now if you are in a traditional two-gender marriage, you will probably want to apply to adjust your status and get a green card.<br>  <br>  www.visajourney.com would be the site to visit in that case; it is set up for people who doing just that. And the visa question will be addressed as you work on status change and a new visa. <br>  <br>  IF you are in a gay marriage, while someone is sure to disagree I don't think this is a marriage problem if all you want to do is execute a name change. While DOMA prevents the government from recognizing a gay marriage, if the state allowed you to change your name in the process of marriage then I am sure they will recognize it for your visa, if your home nation will acknowledge it in your passport. <br>  <br>  So I would say, change your passport first because if they won't change it the visa should be in your original last name. Once the passport is amended, the university should be asked to change your records to your new name, and then if you wish the visa. <br>  <br>  As long as you can show the marriage certificate though I don't think you need to actually do any of that.I think the visa is still valid and so are your other documents; when they expire or need to be changed you should then document and use the new name.
6e17209667f5095dbf74ca7bd2427f10aa	Under the law, these are under the same offence. However, the Judge may take into consideration on the amount stolen to pass the sentences.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  Usually the punishment goes up at the $1000 level.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	What if the guy he stole five dollars from is a 7ft tall maniac who stomps his face into the sidewalk and permanetly unhinges his jaw.|`|nlj7sk5uaa	Yes, why on earth would you do it to begin with?

2lFRYr8Eaa	Reagan fired the Air Traffic Controllers as they did strike and they were federal employees.  <br>  <br>  If the Electric Company is private, the government can use the Taft Hartley Act to impose a 90 day cooling off period.  <br>  <br>  If a Public Utility, there may be a no strike clause.  It would be business specific.  In most cases, management can keep things running in the short term.|`|AA11206283	Government can refer the strike to a mediator; most public utility and essential workers have no-strike contracts.<br>  <br>  Could also order a few 90 day cooling off periods.<br>  <br>  See Regan and the air traffic controllers|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Yes, the government can stop the strike from happening.<br>  <br>  President Reagan did it when the air traffic controllers threatened to go on strike.|`|AA10116706	With respect to the answers above re no strike clauses: virtually ever collective bargaining agreement has a no-strike clause.  However, once the contract has expired so to does the no-strike clause.  This is when strikes and/or lockouts typically happen.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: assuming the electric company is not owned the government, then the answer is no.  Private sector employees have a right to strike under Section 7 of the NLRA.
b7Lo5IAZaa	I do. Anytime the gov. has that much control on the money and people are wayyyy too dependent on them for self-sufficiency, it's trouble.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Why don't people get into their f******* heads that two statements are required to determine visa requirements:<br>  <br>  1. where to you want to travel to<br>  <br>  2. what citizenship/passport do you hold<br>  <br>  A visa application may just take some days in one country whether it will take several weeks in another country. Therefore your question cannot be answered in general.<br>  <br>  By the way: (you have asked the question in the U.S. section of Y!A)<br>  citizens of the United States do not need a visa for tourist purposes of up to 3 months.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.israelemb.org/consular_Visa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelemb.org/consular_Visa.h...</a>
u6ALw1gAaa	If there is a fine then I would guess you have already been convicted of this crime, probably on the day of your trial.  Your 5th Amendment Right guarantees that no penalty will be levied against you without due process (a trial).  Are you sure you weren't found guilty of this charge on the day you were ordered to spend a day in jail?  Or was the day in jail just the day you got arrested?  I really don't have enough info to tell you more.  Maybe you should call the Clerk of Court and talk to them about it.|`|uSeApMt9aa	Criminal justice is a billion dollar industry. It surprises me that this doesn't surprise you. I wouldn't doubt 10 years from now you have a fine in the mail saying you still haven't paid.|`|AA12342445	They look like different offences. Double jeopardy only relates to the same offence being again prosecuted.|`|XLSfTnISaa	Sounds like you only took care of the suspended license and tags.  There are 3 different fines.

494b3aed20cdc74da312bf5f0ada6534aa	Yes it is possible, but the chances of getting the MOS you want after you complete The Basic School really depend on what board thinks that you will do better on.

hd1reKRuaa	I recently enlisted in the Marines. First, they give you the Enlisted Screening test, which basically just tells them your not retarded. Then, you take the ASVAB which is basically an Aptitude test which shows them what jobs you are capable of learning. <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, Yes your husband may be "dumb" but if he's got enough brains to join the Marines, he's not stupid.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The ASVAB is an IQ test, and all service members have to score above a minimum to enlist.  Sadly a quarter of a century ago in the wake of the Vietnam war the services were so hard up for recruits that the Army and the Marines started enlisting people whose ASVAB scores indicated significant mental retardation.  This is not a laughing matter as it resulted in needless fatalities.  One such incident led to a major overhaul of Marine corps training policies, as well as providing a major subplot for "Full Metal Jacket".<br>  I believe that the present ASVAB scores required restrict recruitment to those who are near average and above.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Your choice of jobs does depend a lot on your ASVAB scores which, does have a minimal scoring requirement and sometimes is not a true representation of a person and their skills. No test is. Some people can take tests better than others so their scores could be higher and they would have a better chance at the better jobs. And as for "dumb" people, there may be a few that aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer but hey, they deserve the same respect you would give the rest of the military.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	"dumb" is relative.<br>  <br>  You don't have to take an IQ test, but you do have to take the ASVAB, and then you have a choice of jobs based upon what your ASVAB scores are.  <br>  <br>  Then again, some really smart people choose the jobs that you have to have lower scores to get into...  <br>  <br>  Example, my husband had high asvab scores and could have done any job in the army (pretty much), and then he chooses to be a Cav Scout.  I asked him why and he said because the video looked cool.  Yeah...  So the term "young and stupid" applies here... :)|`|z3APr11Naa	All I can tell you is this,<br>  <br>  You have a to take a test to join any branch. I'm in the ARMY and with my test score I was able to pick my job/ MOS. <br>  <br>  Yes if you have low test score your only going to be able to pick some jobs. <br>  <br>  So to be frank YES all branches will allow a few glass lickers in.|`|K8qAniReaa	Your fiancee has to take the ASVAB and score at least a 30. The ASVAB isn't an IQ test.  It is a general knowledge test.  If he's smart enough to pass the general knowledge test he's smart enough to make it in the Marines.|`|pFlvqhhjaa	Yes you do have to take an IQ test, which is why it is struggling to recruit|`|cCBwK2EGaa	if they do my boot camp platoon all called out sick.  the smart guys are often thrown in the back they look for ahole's to be guide not the smart ones.  also what is his job?  my bad didn't read.

yj3GT7jOaa	A no hire list would be company specific.  They have no control outside of their own limitations.  They just didn't want to hire you for some reason.  It is difficult to sue an employer.  I don't no what would warrant a lawsuit if you are not employed.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	You can't sue, but no company bothers to take time to maintain a "no hire" file.  If you have worked some place and get fired, companies often mark your records with the annotation "do not rehire."  And there re no multi-company "do not hire" references services.  I am not really sure what you are talking about.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	I have never heard of a "no hire list" - please give more details of the situation.

It would be like me putting my nickname instead of my real name.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
ukH1qjCeaa	First, what is your reason(s) for joining.<br>  <br>  As a Naval Reservist you will be required to attend Boot or OCS, depending on your status.  Either takes weeks to complete, then you may be required to attend  school.  Although it is only one weekend a month and two weeks annual training you may be required to complete other assignments that may take more time.<br>  <br>  If you are in a position to "take over" a business give this much thought for you, personally, as well as a future.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Just tell them if he says no it doesnt matter bc he has no control over you. You would probably be better off in the Navy anyway.|`|hAxtd5yTaa	Your boss has no say in the matter.<br>  That's like asking him if you can get married.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Do what you need to do for yourself.

9tcv3TiWaa	JAG cannot help in civil cases which this is considered, they can only advise you on lawyers to see, etc... Now that you do have a lawyer then that is the best step to take.   In the US it is very difficult for the men to get sole custody of the children no matter what happens.  So most likely that will not happen at all, 50/50 could be an option it is going to depend on the state and the judge that rules in the case if it goes to court.  <br>  <br>  Now that you are married still he should have been giving you partial BAH w/dependents if he is getting it.   If he hasn't then there is the first issue that can be brought up.  Getting him into trouble can cause problems that include reduction in rank so loss of pay. But then again it might not.  It could bring more issues up in court when ruling in your favor.   Your child's benefits will not change as long as he is AD, she will still have access to the base, medical, dental, etc.... Just like you do until the divorce is final.|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	YOU NEED TO TALK TO A LAWYER.<br>  <br>  People on Yahoo! Answers are not the right resource.  Military divorces are different than private sector divorces, and you need good advice.  Trolling for any advice is a bad idea.  Go talk to the base legal office and get some good legal advice.  It's free and they are there to fill that need.  You can also go to the family support center on base and use the resources there.  If your husband left you while you were pregnant, he may have doomed himself in the process.  You need to get good advice from someone who knows what they are talking about.|`|SmFcDx4waa	as long as you have the desire and the funds to take care of her, there is NO WAY he gets sole custody - the only way that would happen is if you agreed to it or you were a danger to the child....but as long as HE is not a danger and pays his share of the child support, then he gets some custody too... so it will probably be joint custody for both of you...if he is out of state then he will probably get a few months a year where she stays with him...or something like that.
AA12341057	Ask him to leave first, and give him a deadline to accomplish it (two weeks, a month?). Then at the deadline, when he's gone to work or wherever he goes, put his belongings out on the porch, change all the locks, and have 911 on speed dial.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he'll finally understand what the drugs have done to his relationship with you.<br>  <br>  EVOC is correct, changing the locks is technically illegal, but functional. It's a rarely stupid druggie that will call the cops because his mother locked him out for getting high. Sure, you could go through a drawn-out legal battle to have your son evicted by the police over the course of several months, but it's not that hard to do it yourself.|`|AA10546011	I had some friends with a similar problem.<br>  <br>  They sold their house, bought a RV and drove away from the house and the son.|`|FeivZKiaaa	Time for tough love. When he is out of the house, change the locks & don't let him back in the house. Be sure to put out his stuff. Either that or call the cops as he leaves the house drunk or with drugs on him & have him arrested. <br>  <br>  Do not let him back in the house. You have to be willing to let him live on the streets, he will not change if you keep supporting him & letting him leech off you.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	pack his stuff set outside and change locks.<br>  don't understand how the police can't remove him.  Is his name on the mortgage?  does he pay half the bills?|`|RRFbDou9aa	You have to do the legal eviction process for your state.<br>  <br>  If he's in a facility move his stuff into a storage locker and change the locks before he gets back.  It's not legal but it would work.  Just my 2c.|`|a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	Well, it is time for a dead beat son to move out and get off the apron strings.  First.  Get the car keys back.  It is your car not his.  Then, go to the court house and start the eviction process.  In every state there is a process for evicting tenants.  That is what your son has become, a tenant.  That is why the police cannot remove him.  Serve him with the paperwork and evict him.  If he becomes threatening (which he very well could) get a protection order as well.<br>  <br>  This is a harsh suggestion but he will not leave until you take the steps to have him removed.  I can guarantee he won't starve to death or be living in the street.|`|aTLiaEGxaa	Obviously there is much going on here. Sticking to the heart of the matter of getting him out of the house: he is a tenant and you are a landlord. Go to your local courthouse and inquire about evicting a tenant. There is an official process which has several steps and time lines. Once you have followed the process, the police can remove him if he will not leave on his own.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	He's 27, tell him to pack his stuff and get the hell out.  It is your house, if he refuses to go, he is tresspassing, have him arrested.|`|2nRjy734aa	Go to your local court house and get a restraining order.|`|r1WMBKvuaa	Why don't you just move away yourself. Don't let him know where you are.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	You need to call that show "Intervention" if you do i will watch it.|`|AA10347782	It appears the police "do not wish to remove him" as opposed to the police can't remove him. If the lease is in your name, and you pay the rent then technically, you are the owner of the apt/house.<br>  All you have to do is take your son to "eviction court" (take no money from your son. Even if he has never paid you. Take no money or gifts from your son during this process)<br>  <br>   Inform the judge, that the police told you they were not able to remove your son because he lives there and receives mail. But, you are the tenant, provide written documentation from the landlord and receipts that you have paid in rent. Tell the judge you wish to evict your son from your apt/house. As long as you have not taken any money or gifts from your son during the eviction. The judge will give him 3-10 days to move out. If the son does not move out the shreiff/balief will move him out. <br>  <br>  And if your son returns to the property you can inform the police you have an eviction order against your son and he is now tresspassing on your property. Be prepared to either sell your son the car or give it to him. As you do not wish to give him a reaosn to hang out. Technically this is the legal way to get your son off your property. Once a judge issues the writ, the polce can't over ride it. Only another judge can. <br>  You can always tell the mailman your son no longer lives here and have them return his mail. Good luck!!|`|VRSUyeqbaa	i know this may be hard, but just tell him to get out. you are the mother, he is the child, cut the apron strings. it is your house, he is not paying  rent, he doesn't live there. as long as you keep the door open, he will keep coming back....make him leave and when he cleans up his act (permanently), then maybe you'll consider it, but not until then.|`|b8svqAMAaa	Even if you get a restraining order it will not stop him from living there.  Once he has established residency he does not have to move out unless you go to the court and evict him legally.  This sucks, but it is the only way that you can MAKE him leave.  The eviction process takes a while but it is legal and eventually he will have to choice but to have to move.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey look.. someone gave me a thumbs down because they obviously don't know what the right answer is.  haha<br>  <br>  **you can not change the locks to prevent him from returning.  he lives there, its against the law to do this and throw all of his things out of the house.
GSJ9gqVWaa	I think the EU law is that to establish your right to travel as an EU citizen across internal borders that operate border controls you need to show either an official national identity card or a passport.  Neither military ID nor a proof of age card, even the garda one, count as a national identity card.  You do not need either of them to move within the schengen zone, which covers most of continental europe, or the common travel area, which covers the Isle of Man, the UK, including NI, the Republic of Ireland and the Channel Islands.  However Spain is schengen and the UK is common travel area, which means they maintain border formalities.  That means you would need official ID.  If you want to go from Germany or France you are fine with anything that establishes your identity and that you are a EU citizen.  You won't need them for the border on the continent, the borders are unmanned, but you might need to prove that you are allowed to be in Spain if you get stopped for some reason.|`|mldo1vxYaa	No you have to have a passport to fly to spain now, they have new requirements as of about a year ago. You will need a passport.|`|1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	Well yes, if you go from say Ireland to France. I am assuming at least one of those documents establishes yoru nationality.<br>  <br>  You can enter France on an identity card and there are no customs or passport checks internal as I understand it, so you can then proceed to Spain without a passport. <br>  <br>  If you go directly from the UK or Ireland they might require a passport. But not if you go to France first.|`|fox5a3ePaa	no
sq8wusnbaa	While he's in boot camp write him as much as you can it'll help get him through it and show him you care.He may get to call a few times from boot camp too. Be at the graduation if you can. After boot camp he goes to a-school. A- school isn't really hard, my husband use to call me daily while he was there ( we were just dating at the time).Then he gets his base and depending on what his on their schedule varies. But once he's based he'll be able to talk to you whenever, come home on leave, or you could possibly go visit. The distance and everything the navy put us through brought us closer together, and it sounds like you've already dealt with a lot you guys should be fine. I wish you the best of luck the life really isn't as bad as some people make it!|`|htaxf1jJaa	Well when he graduates boot camp, make sure youre there! And when he gives you his mailing address for boot camp, write him as much as possible cause they love mail call, and you can even send him a few pictures if you want but make sure they won't get him in trouble cause they're not allowed that stuff at boot. Communication is so important in a military relationship, just get in touch with him as much as you can when hes in A school, after boot.  My brother graduated Marine boot camp in August 2008 and it was tough without him cause we are so close and what not, but everytime i got a letter it made my day. And now my boyfriend is at Air Force basic and he left Jan 5th and graduates March 6th, just days away! Everytime i get a letter from him it's just so awesome to be able to hear from him and what not, and i just got a phone call from him on Monday, which the feeling is un explainable. If your boyfriend is lucky, he may ge to make a few phone calls =) Time flies soo fast when it comes down to boot camp/basic. Webcam will help a lot. it's gunna be tough but hang in there. Email me if you wanna talk! =)|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	You should expect nothing...<br>  <br>  But you should expect to be alone a lot.<br>  You should expect him to come back different (hopefully more mature)<br>  You should expect him to be tired, gone a lot, proud.<br>  <br>  Yes, most important, be proud.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Well it depends. Basic training will be pretty much letters with a phone call or two. Do not send any gifts that make it appear to be contraband, my girlfriend did that and got me in trouble and they kept it anyway. When he gets to school after boot camp he will have more freedom to write, call, and maybe even visit. Then depending on his rate (job) and what the duty he requests (or gets) will determine the rest. Most ships go out for 6 months. Very few not so much. Being away from him the whole time will pretty much make the entire relationship long distance. If you decide to move in with him then there are groups for spouses and what not to support one another while he is out on deployment.|`|1c2ff0589d655a36a936d6af96fb7116aa	Get ready<br>  <br>    he's probably going oversea's and going to meet many wonderful women|`|E8anv8Zzaa	I would get married if you are ready. Most g/f's and b/f's don't work out when a guy joins the Navy. Trust me I know.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	A lot of se-men cuming over ... *hehe*...
VRSUyeqbaa	no, they do not. it is trespassing. what you need to do is set up a video camera somewhere where they cant see it and video tape it and take it to the police|`|eulMjLtPaa	Change the locks.  Don't give them a key.|`|s30Duwdraa	They don't have the right no matter how many favors they've done for you.  It's your house and they're breaking the law.  If they have nothing to hide, then they can wait til you get home!!<br>  <br>  Change the locks and get some surveillance equipment set up, or a home alarm.  It will cost you monthly, but your house insurance will go down and it's for the better in the long run.  <br>  <br>  If you don't take the alarm route, get some nanny cams and set them up at your doors to see what's going on while you're not there.<br>  <br>  They sound very sneaky and not to be trusted.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	No, it is a crime for them to come into you home if you are not there.  Change the locks, and don't give them a key.<br>  <br>  If you think they planted bugs in your house then it is probably time to do a little house work.<br>  <br>  Get a job so that you don't have to ask them for money.<br>  <br>  Also, buy a big mean dog, and keep it in the house when you are not there.  Or just get an alarm installed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|k56mmj2eaa	If it is your house, I would change the locks and not give them a key. I would also call the police and ask about having a restraining order put against the family. so they can not come in the house. if they do they will be arrested.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	Run a bug scanner thru the house, chcnage all the locks.  Next time they illegally enter, have them arrested.|`|AA10753086	Change the locks and don't give them keys.  If they enter call the police and report a breakin.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Change the locks and tell them if they break in, you will report them to the police for breaking and entering. Keep a record of anything they take, any time they are in your home, and any threats they make. If you really believe they planted bugs in your house, which isn't very likely since most people wouldn't even know how to access such things, you can talk to a PI and ask him to sweep the house for bugs. You should also put some small cameras around the house yourself; that way, if they do break in, you will have all the evidence you need to keep them from doing it again.
esOaJoqBaa	You need to be taking 12 credits to get the full monthly amount. Anything less than that and you will still get paid, just not the full amount.

We are still waiting for Charity to get back up and running. To get New Orleans back to the way it used to be! Or what about the state Insurance Policy? All the blacks can get whatever they want for their 6 kids and getting brand new housing.  But the single white working woman cant get a dammmmmm thing! Somethings wrong. They are spending BILLIONS of OUR tax dollars to build these worthless people beautiful houses, that they are just going to run to shhhhittttt in a year or two and start slinging drugs out of.. and getting doors kicked in really soon!

Not only we will have your failed record in our favor, we will have your arrogant complacency|`|VK0brk89aa	No he didn't.<br>  <br>  He spoke in plain language so that the average Obama voter could understand him. He slammed Obama without a forceful attack.<br>  <br>  Jindal laid out his States Plan in which he got rid of corruption (Obama didn't do that in Chicago), Jindal cut taxes 6 six times (Obama only voted to raise taxes on his State), Jindal has added employment to his State in Dec 08 ect.....<br>  <br>  Jindal Made Obama look incompetent!<br>  <br>  The Republican Party has many new bright up and comings!|`|EPObVPzVaa	So what exactly did he say that you didn't like, or were you even listening?<br>  <br>  He's a Republican, so you didn't listen.<br>  He's not white so, you didn't listen.<br>  He doesn't agree with 0'Bama so, you didn't listen.<br>  <br>  I would have preferred if he had buttoned his jacket but, I listened anyway.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	He was just being himself, so if the shoe fits...<br>  eye witnesses put him 75 miles from the sheriff's office when the "call" came in so he may have been caught in his first lie.|`|Qc59JvE1aa	you are a racist,jindal is doing just fine
7ONKVbbiaa	*shakes head*<br>  Obama's website posted a short form birth certificate, which clearly states his place of birth as Honolulu. <br>  Being a Senator from Illinois, as well as US Senator REQUIRES background investigation and security clearance via the Govt. Please note carefully, these ARE required, and they are NOT PUBLIC records. Every Senator has these. It is a complete fabrication on the part of anyone to claim he "was not investigated". <br>  The state of Hawaii issued an official press release to stop months of harassment, and VERIFIED that they personally viewed his original birth records. Note again.. had that record said ANYTHING except Hawaii, they would have been violating the law to not report him for fraud. They are not that stupid. Did they release a copy or tell someone the name of the Dr.?? No. That is contrary to law in Hawaii, and in all states. No birth certificate is a public document. <br>  The claims of the "other side".. a video, in a foreign language that I assume you don't speak.. so you accept the "translation" of the website. Just a matter of rational thinking.. my grandmother, like any elderly person, can be misled. If she says my husband was born in Arkansas.. it does not make it a fact. It does not make her a liar. It makes her confused, and in Obama's case.. the confusion was probably created.  <br>  "Grandma said" against the US govt, and the state of Hawaii. And you believe that Grandma is right?? You have a problem. <br>  Why does he not address this? In simple terrms, both Obama and the entire US govt are fully aware of where he was born. Neither one has time for screwing around with ignorant internet hoaxes. <br>  No, it does not make me wonder. The thing that does make me wonder is how anyone could be so gullible to question this. <br>  What you do with your time and energy is up to you.<br>  ps<br>  screw the lawsuits, none of which comprehend the simple bottom line that any court "ordering" Obama to show you his documents, would be in violation of his rights, and thus illegal.<br>  and we won't even worry about people who are so misinformed that they do not know ALL MEDICAL RECORDS, OF ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, ARE SEALED BY LAW.|`|967aae0d16dea5cecb00409736b6dcb0aa	I heard that his father was an alien and the only reason his skin is so dark, is because he had to use a color that would cover up the green. <br>  <br>  That's what my best friend's uncle's aunt's sister-in-law said, and she should know, she was at his inauguration and saw him on the big screen.<br>  <br>  EDIT: this is sarcasm people, because I am so tired of this question being raised.

To say we should all have some of the wealth and regularly diminish the wealth our country has.  To promise to work with even those who disagree with him then surround himself with steadfast liberal backers.  To promise to control government spending only to become the most enthusiastic spender.  He no longer needs the people and he knows it.  We are no longer in control of our government.

This, however, is funded by the wealthy, who will experience severe tax hikes with this budget. How will this entice innovation for energy giants and American business as a whole?

The reason that women don't serve in the French Foreign Legion, Parachute Regiment, Royal Marines, SAS etc is because the physical entry standards are unbelievably tough.

A woman who trains equally as hard or even harder would still not achieve the level of strength that a man would achieve. <br>  <br>  There are some women who would achieve the required standard but they are still so few and far between that the level of expense to get the very few recruits through is not justified.

What they don't seem to understand is that this federal money that's supposed to create jobs is only temporary; when the money runs out, so do the jobs.  However, the taxes needed to continue these programs are going to come out of the pockets of guess who - the middle class!  Tax the rich?  Sure, the way they tried to tax the rich in England a few decades back, on which they built their cradle-to-grave "nanny government".  Then when the rich pulled out in droves, taking their money to places like Switzerland and Spain, guess who got stuck financing the gimmie lifestyle the poor were used to?

6g3Z8NwVaa	Absolutely and really, it all comes down to marketing and advertising. Our entire lives are filled with commercials, whether we're aware of it or not. We are a materialistic culture and we equate happiness with products because marketing emphasizes how a product can make you feel as opposed to its function. <br>  <br>  Most products when you break them down, are essentially the same as far as function. But the advertising makes you feel that X brand is better than Y brand and therefore will make you happier. I limit my tv watching to 3 or 4 hours a week and I've tried to debrand my life. I try to be mindful of my purchases between the essentials (like food) and the luxuries (like ipods) and I rarely spend money on the luxuries. And what I choose to buy with the essentials comes down to price and function over brand name recognition. But it's hard to deprogram yourself and I can see why people would rather live a comfortable McLife.<br>  <br>  Read No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies by Naomi Klein if you haven't.

All of the TV, magazines, movies, fashion, etc. do what they do because we keep buying.  If we all closed up the wallets or tuned off the TV and made it clear we were more than willing to read books, go outside or (god forbid) talk to each other until they start putting on more programing, covering more stories on the news, etc, that we want to see then I can tell you that's what they would produce.  The market works.  Supply will change if the demand does.

No progress will be made in this country if we are bickering at each other constantly. Face it, the democrats can't do it alone, neither can the republicans. We all have to learn to set our differences aside to become one nation. Stop blaming each other for this country's issues- four year old's act that way.

The purpose was good, but the way it was handled was bad. The loans were made, but often the people did not understand that the original interest rate was not permanent...nor would the low payment be permanent. But, by the time the rate jumped up, the loans had already been sold to the mega banks...with the smaller bankers making a lot of money on the deal. When the rates and conditions of the loan changed, many people were not able to continue making the payments...and went into foreclosure. Once this started, the housing prices started dropping...and because of the upside down nature of property values, many more people felt that it was not worth it to try to continue paying on the mortgages (even those who had been able to afford it), so they just let it go into foreclosure. Because the big megabanks were the ones left holding the bag, they suddenly became owners of bad debts. It was generally a snafu all the way around. They took the risk, and they lost.|`|bqJgdcfLaa	The credit ratings agencies are pretty terrible, but I don't think you can make an argument that the US defaults on its debt in any situation short of apocalypse.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	The American people can do anything and pay for it.

Some are ideological and some are not.  I'd like to see him run if, for no other reason, he'll be a push to other Republicans to really think about what their platform is.<br>  <br>  As for Palin, she's proven herself to be an embarrassment to her own party.  Liberals don't like her because she's a kook.  And I'm not talking about her politics.  Jindal is not, as far as I can tell, a kook.<br>  <br>  But the party needed to stand behind her and pretend that she was the best thing since sliced bread.  Right now, they aren't saying anything because they expect her to hang her repeatedly between now and the election.<br>  <br>  I say: if you're a Republican, stand behind a good candidate that you believe in.  There's no need to pretend that you like Palin.  In fact, go ahead and pan her.<br>  <br>  After all, it's the same criticism some have of Democrats: you stood behind Obama even though he wasn't particularly good.  And see what happened?<br>  <br>  So, my advice to you as a conservative is not to rah-rah for Sarah, but to return to what really matters to you and find a candidate that meets that ideal and you feel could, in fact, do a good job with it.  Not Sarah.  Bobby?  I'd like to see how he conducts himself over the next few years.|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	Bobby Jindal would be the worse decision anyone could ever make for President!

Leave America Free.|`|HkhfzbLhaa	CONSERVATIVES don't like National Health Care because it doesn't work. Countries around the world have national systems, and there isn't a single one that is successful. They cost a fortune in taxpayer dollars and provide piss poor levels of care compared to our current system. They all are failing. The only thing wrong with the current system is the abuse of emergency room, frivolous lawsuits and the fact that those of us who do pay for our healthcare already pay for those who don't. Just because we are Americans doesn't mean that we can do the impossible. We can't make national health care work, we can't make socialism work, and the only way that life works is that you reward good behavior and punish bad, aka conservatism, amen.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Nope because this "Repub" does not like nor watch Nascar....

AA10258539	Do not marry on a B-2 visa (and overstay) as it may jeopardize your chances of being petitioned. Do it the right way. If you marry now, you have to go back to your country and wait for the petition to be approved (K-3). OR Go home and let him do the petition for a fiancee visa. Both have the same time period for processing. Varies from 8-12 months depending on the load of the embassy.

I say this and people just respond with..."oh no they wouldn't be able to do that again".<br>  <br>  That's exactly why they may do the same thing....to prove that we cannot stop them. The goal of these terrorists nuts is not just to do damage, but to strike fear into everyone in the country. This would be one ultimate way of doing that.<br>  <br>  I also think they may strike a small town somewhere, because then it will eliminate this idea that most people have, which is that the targets are only major cities.<br>  <br>  It's not if they strike again, but when. We are 8 years from the attack in 2001 and that was the time gap between 9/11 and the world trade bombing in 1993. So I think it will be this year. Scary.|`|EzsnkxgVaa	Judging only from prior attacks.<br>  <br>  Al Qaeda tried to bomb the twin towers in 97 and failed to do major damage. They came back and used something we would not expect to finish it off in 2001, plus they had graduated to their signature multiple synchronized target strategy (but failed to hit the Capital building).<br>  <br>  Therefore...I predict that they will use yet another new approach on multiple synchronized targets...the main target being the Capital.<br>  <br>  Since the Capital is unapproachable, and they have done the airplane thing, and the airspace is defended by missiles...they may try another low tech approach such as smuggling mortars or small artillery/rockets in and firing from multiple positions around Washington at various targets.<br>  <br>  It will be soon...as in we are over-due for an attack.|`|882aadf45b04a15ccacc11c27555a716aa	You got part of it right.

It looks like DOMESTIC terrorism took us out before the islamic terrorists could strike back again.|`|bqJgdcfLaa	It will be in NYC or DC, on some recognizable building.  It is really predictable, especially when you have the resources of the US government.  If we have decent port security (i.e. airports, seaports, and borders), it won't happen, or at least a nuclear attack won't happen.  The problem is that the government isn't spending enough money on port security.   Why?  Because government is bad of course.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Well, hopefully it won't happen but if I had to take a stab at it...I'd say they'll leave us alone until we start looking like we're fixing our problems.

If Iran gets it's hands on a nuclear weapon, Iran will transfer that nuclear weapon to Muslim Terrorists.<br>  <br>  I can guarantee you the Muslim Terrorists will place that nuclear weapon in a contaner on a container ship and detonate it as the ship comes into port.<br>  <br>  With respect to time frame.<br>  <br>  If conventional explosives are used, within the next year.<br>  <br>  If nuclear weapons are used, I would say within 6 months of the day that Iran gets it's hands on a nuclear weapon.|`|Qc59JvE1aa	they will work that out with there main man obama,he's a friend of theres,you know|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	I would assume Miami or maybe even Boston...could be NYC again.<br>  <br>  They've been lusting over the White House for ages too.<br>  <br>  I just don't see why they would go after anything other than capitalistic symbols because it wouldn't help their cause of being anti"meddlesome" in their countries.

Neither the pregnancy instruction, nor the uniform regulations, provides guidance on the appearance of soft-soled shoes for pregnant women or personnel on light duty for any other reason.<br>  <br>  However, a valid argument is that you are only required to wear items required to be in your seabag, and the uniform regs give this guidance on athletic shoes: "Low or high-cut commercial brand athletic shoe designed to support planned exercise.

Good thing they're wealthy.... or Bristol would end up on welfare.... and then her mother's head would explode.<br>  <br>  Truth is that most girls are sexually mature by 12-13 and boys shortly thereafter.  To think that they have the willpower to ignore what their hormones are telling their body is really pretty ridiculous.

But they just don't seem to care much about the other kids who don't get any sex education at home.  About the kids who don't have a solid religious or high moral compass.  Those kids are just shyt out of luck, and I think that really sucks and is incredibly selfish.  Teenagers are notoriously hormonally wacked out.  There is no one that can get lost in a moment like a teenager.

As a person living in Texas (and have for quite sometime) it's not just about teaching abstinence only... it's the attitude girls have here (in particular Mexican girls) that it is "cool" to get pregnant from their boyfriends... Mexican girls in particular, believe it's a rite of passage to get pregnant to the point they will pressure their peers into doing so and if you do get pregnant than it's praised and if you don't you are ostracized... If you are wanting to get pregnant it is not going to matter whether or not contraceptives are taught and easily attainable...|`|yoPNXiluaa	I saw that list and it even said that states such as California, New York, New Jersey, DC, etc. had the highest number of reported pregnancies. Plus in some cases the differences is in the race.  Plus some abortion statitics are not even mentioned.<br>  <br>  I don't think that any sex-education program is realistic.  My school had sex education, and there still was teen pregnancies.  The education of it, isn't the problem.

0h9aD7Toaa	Absolutely, under sharia law, they have no rights what so ever, the family dog has more rights|`|G3KCzV3saa	Although in places like the U.K. there is the right to refuse Sharia Law, you must keep in mind that these women are often in situations that do not lend themselves to freedom of choice.  These women are often forced into accepting Sharia law rather than be disowned by their family and/or community.  In the interest in the rights of all citizens, I think a good government should make it difficult for any citizen to abandon their rights in the manner that adherence to Sharia law makes women abandon their rights.|`|AA10546011	Most definitely !!!|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Where?  Full sharia certainly infringes on personal freedoms and rights of women.<br>  <br>  If you are referring to the use of sharia in countries like the UK, however, it's a different story, because the law is only used with the full approval of all parties.  A woman cannot agree to the use of Sharia law and then complain that it infringes her rights.<br>  <br>  Simply put, she has an overriding right: the right to refuse to submit to sharia jurisdiction.

c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Whatever you do DON"T make him feel like he is being put under a spotlight. Sit him down calmly and tell him you love him and make it a safe environment for talking about things so he doesnt feel the need to lie. You need to create a feeling a of trust when you talk to him. I wouldn't sneak in his room, this will only cause distrust and push him further away from you when he finds out (and he will) you did it. This will only make him want to sell more and hang around the people who are bad influences on him instead of people who realy care about him and want to help him get on the right side, like you.<br>  He needs to feel like he can talk to you about anything. Don't get mad at him, just tell him (if he says yes) that you want him to stop (and tell him what could happen as far as the law and getting YOU in trouble as well.) and if he doesn't stop then you will be forced to relay the consequenced even though you will hate it. (BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH) If you have idol threats he will never take you seriously again. Tell him you are willing to help him, get a new phone number and get away from selling. Hope this is helpful. I wish you the best, this is a tough situation.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	You can make sure you don't offend your brother and continue to risk loosing your house or you can be a big sister and help him by having some rules and structure starting with you can't distribute illegal narcotics from my home because I don't want to go to jail or loose my house.  It's up to you though if they bust him you obviously won't be able to claim you didn't know because the prosecuter will make you look like a fool and you'll loose everything for aiding and abetting felony drug sales.  They'll ask you if knew he had ever taken drugs.  They'll ask if people come to the home briefly and leave.  Even with just these 2 statements a reasonable person would suspect their home is being used for narcotics trafficing and you will be found guilty.  I think it's great you want to help your brother and care for him though right now you are just supporting his habit.  It's hard to be tough though it's the only thing that will help him.  BTW:  It's your house, your rules.  I know you are a sister though needs needs a parent right now and if you care for him that's the role you'll need to play.  Good luck.  I don't envy you though ignoring this when you know better will hurt your brother and yourself.  Please take the difficult step of helping him.  He'll thank you someday though not when you lay down the law.  I wish you the best.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Go ahead and offend him. He's living with YOU, not the other way around. If he's smokin' it, and his 'pals' are stopping by for 5 minutes, he's selling. I'd put money on it. Ask him straight, just don't be a jerk. If he is, tell him to stop selling or leave. If he is selling drugs in your house, you are selling too.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	With little pre thought<br>  .<br>  Just walk up and say<br>  .<br>  Hey I just got and idea where can a person get some weed in this town<br>  .<br>  If you see a smile turn around and leave with out saying another word<br>  .<br>  If a kind of strange look on the face <br>  .<br>  Get the hell out of there<br>  .<br>  So in the long run not a real run only a term <br>  .<br>  Get some one else to do it for you <br>  If you can that is<br>  .<br>  But that will cost you a couple more <br>  .|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Why worry about offending him?

Me personally i wouldn't ask him anything. I would look through everything in his room. Since you would rather ask just come out with it. Don't beat around the bush. "Do you sell Green in my house".He will probably lie but just know that if he gets caught since it is your house you will go down with him. Show some tough love and tell him you dont know what he is doing but its suspicious how his friends come in and leave so soon and if he is doing something he has no business it needs to stop now or you will kick him out too.

Not all humans live the rest of their lives living off of fruits, berries and vegetables.  Plus, how do you know the plants don't feel anything when you pluck them for food?? Nobody has ever given me an answer on that one yet...<br>  <br>  I think there is a major problem with the way slaughterhouses deal with the livestock shipments.  Beating them does no good morally, and I look down upon it.  I believe that those animals are serving a good purpose and giving us a necessity, and therefore we should be treating them well up to their death.  Native Americans showed the up-most respect to the animals they killed for food.  I myself who is an avid hunter and fisherman treat the animals I kill for food with respect, I insure that it will quick and no suffering will be done.  One shot to the head and its all over.

Why is it we get so worked up and ruin someone's career because he is fighting dogs but don't care that workers in some slaughter house are torturing chickens or that animals are living in such a disgusting unnatural environment that they need to be injected with antibiotics to keep them alive. Animals that are killed by hunters at least get a chance at life and lead a normal life until they are killed, but animals in factory farms live a life of hell where they are caged, injected with hormones and antibiotics etc. Even if you care nothing about the welfare of the animal, you should at the very least be concerned about how unhealthy it is to eat an animal that has been raised in this environment.<br>  EDIT: Sorry Dan, gave you a thumbs down by mistake.

It's absolutely nothing but bribery through "legal" channels. The politicans wrote laws so that they could accept these bribes.<br>  <br>  When politicians are allowed to accept bribes, they are no longer representing the best interests of their constitutents. They are only representing the people who have given them large "campaign donations."<br>  <br>  These idiots are paid outrageous salaries (with tons of perks). They don't need to accept bribes on top of they money we're already paying them. Most of them make more from lobbiests than they do from us taxpayers, so where do you think their loyalties reside?<br>  <br>  If you don't like that one, the other thing would be to go with the Fair Tax. It would elminate the tens of thousands of pages of tax code that is written to benefit those who give the largest contributions to politicians. The Fair Tax puts a tax on items when you buy them instead of a tax on money that you've earned.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you want to save money, you get to do it tax free (not just in a retirement account). You get to earn interest on that tax until you spend it. It also forces people with illegal incomes to pay taxes. If they want to buy things, they will pay taxes.<br>  <br>  It will force people with tax shelters to pay their fair share. No more hiding their money.<br>  <br>  The poor will NOT suffer under this tax code. EVERYONE will receive a rebate on the taxes they spend on necessities like food and clothing.<br>  <br>  Read about it at www.fairtax.org. It's a really great idea.<br>  <br>  .

You should have demanded a copy of the lease, or at the very least looked at the document she was citing.  Sorry.|`|5PWEBOj0aa	if your 30 day notice was that you were going to move out at the end of your lease, then yes technically you have the right to take them to court... but if you gave your notice but the lease wasn't over yet, they have the right to charge you until your lease is up (unless someone takes over your lease) In which if you break the lease you do not get your deposit back... but you didnt mention whether you got your deposit back.... but you say they ripped up the carpets and and did major renovations... was that due to the place being old and needing it for normal "wear and tear", or were there major parties,  or pets the scratched the floors or other distruction while you were there? If that is the case they can take your deposit to cover that too... <br>  <br>  have you looked at this site, it might help you find some answers to your questions...

n2oEhdZiaa	the old 11th ACR didn't deploy, but they have deployed ISO of OIF (I was colocated with some of their elements) and i think they have been redesignated as the 11th Regimental Combat Team (Heavy) but I'm not sure.  I know they have an affiliation with the Guard out there that rounds out some of their support units when they deploy.  You may not know exactly what you'll be doing until you get there, but I would expect a lot of field time.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Bummer, Ft. Irwin is about as hot as it gets in the US and it's cold in the winter. And Barstow is 40 miles away. Ugh, what a pit.|`|jthpq6Egaa	As the OPFOR at Ft. Irwin, you're training will focus more on urban and asymmetrical warfare combat training which reflects the current operational environment that our deployed Soldiers face.  The training you conduct will be on a rotation, which you'll learn all about once you get stationed there.<br>  <br>  The area is in the middle of nowhere.  The nearest town is Barstow and there is really not much there (it's about a 30 minute trip from Irwin).  But you are somewhat centrally located to San Bernardino (about 2 hours), Los Angeles (about 3+ hours), Las Vegas (about 3 hours), Palm Springs (about 3 hours) and in the summer Lake Havasu (about 3 hours).<br>  <br>  Now, your DS probably got his patch when the 11th ACR deployed back in '03 and again in '05.  And those deployments were more to train the Afghan and Iraqi forces.  So unless that requirement comes up again, then 11th ACR isn't going anywhere any time soon.  Well, not that I'm aware of.

If you want to go over there to marry him you would have to get a passport first.  Then if you want to stay for awhile you would need a visa.  When you get there staying on post isn't an option on Camp Hovey and even after you marry him he would still have to get an apartment off-post for you to stay in.
WvAlIncZaa	In the NAvy, there is a Sea-Shore rotation.  That basically means that every rate-and its brogen down further my rank-has to serve a certain amount of time on sea duty and shore duty (some look at it as sea orders and shore orders).  With ACs, I believe their shore time, at least for AC2s (E-5s) is 5 years shore.  Conversly, a BM has about the same amount of time for sea.  So if your trying to be shore, then AC is a pretty good rate.<br>  <br>  I'm not terribly familiar with FTS so I would suggest you research that online or talk to your recruiter or the folks at meps.  We have a guy at my command and he's National Call to Serve which is similar I believe and although he's technically a reservist, he's pretty much active duty.  He's here everyday with us and gets the same pay but his contract isn't as long and bonuses for FTS and NCS isn't as high as active duty.<br>  <br>  Being assigned to a ship as an AC is sort of slim.  Most ship billets are on LHDs/LHAs and carriers and we don't have a sh*it ton of those but the chance is still there.<br>  <br>  I'm not an AC but I am at a command that is about 80% AC so if you have any questions, you can shoot me a message.

How anyone can think its a great policy to take from those who create jobs for all is beyond me. How many folks does a non productive person hire?

BO is waiting there to tax every single penny that is made.  There is no good reason to risk my money in a market that is under attack from the obama administration.<br>  <br>  Obama was a very strong supporter of the sub-prime lending practise that clinton forced on the lenders in the 90's that then led to the mortgage meltdown.  Since the real estate market is 25% of the US economy when it fell the rest followed.

Don't forget that it was the banks that made borrowing options available to millions of americans knowing they wouldn't be able to handle it if the housing market crashes or the interest rates go up, then Wall Street decided to buy shares of the peoples loans from the banks and decided to sell overseas knowing very well that housing prices and interest rates will not always go up.  <br>  <br>  If you have your money in stocks, I suggest to leave it alone, specially if you have 401k.

6bd5dc5ab362e218189d7e6247b7a2f6aa	Hi, I am a former disability examiner for DDS, the agency that makes decisions on disability claims for the social security administration (social security disability claims and SSI disability claims). <br>  <br>  From what you mentioned, it sounds as though you were denied on your initial claim (another way of saying "disability application") and it also sounds like you filed a request for reconsideration, which is the first appeal that is available to disability claimants.<br>  <br>  Reconsideration appeals tend to have a higher rate of denial than even initial claims; therefore, for this reason, you may wish to consider finding representation. The reason I say this is that, if you are denied on your reconsideration appeal, the next step will be to file your second appeal in which you can make a request for a disability hearing that will be conducted by an administrative law judge. Going to a hearing like this without the benefit of representation is never a good idea, simply because your case will not get proper preparation if you choose to represent yourself. <br>  <br>  So, to recap, it often makes sense to get a representative after you have been denied on your initial claim because the odds are strong that you will be denied on the first appeal as well and will have to request the second appeal which is a hearing. Reconsideration appeals, by the way, are denied about 85 percent of the time. And this is why most claimants end up having to go to a hearing that involves a judge. <br>  <br>  Regarding the issue of temporary disability, I can tell you from having worked as a disability examiner that the social security administration does not offer temporary disability benefits, or benefits for partial disability (as the veterans administration does). <br>  <br>  With social security disability and SSI disability, your condition must be so severe that it prevents you from being able to work and earn what is considered to be a substantial and gainful income at a job you've done in the past, or at any other form of work for which you might be qualified based on your age, education, job skills, and current limitations, based on your medical condition.<br>  <br>  In fact, to be awarded disability benefits from the social security administration, your condition must last at least one full year, in addition to precluding your ability to engage in work activity. <br>  <br>  If you feel that your case has gone on for too long (though to be honest, the time frame you're mentioning is typical), then you can speak to your attorney (when you get one) about trying to have your case expedited based on something known as "dire need". <br>  <br>  However, dire need expedites are usually only granted for cases that are pending at the hearing level, meaning that a request for a hearing has been made. And this cannot be made until your reconsideration appeal has been denied.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your case.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	you should be applying for disability anyway unless you are over 65 then you cannot be denied your ss benefits.  Talk to an attorney and see what he says do.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Hire an attorney who specializes in SS cases; that's what I did.  They can only take a small portion of your retroactive award.<br>  <br>  Yes to both your questions below.<br>  <br>  Your case is not uncommon.  Sadly, I know of a woman who died two years ago while awaiting her SS money.|`|AA10667393	You should have applied for Social Security Disability income, and you should have consulted a lawyer who does these cases before applying, definitely when you got your denial. Having an attorney usually results in a better outcome on appeal. Most doctors do not know how to write up a case for disability.<br>  <br>  If you get temporary disability (it is always temporary anyway for SSDI) and your claim is denied on appeal, you will have to pay it back.|`|wFK2vVyHaa	You must have a disabling condition that is expected to last for one year or result in death.  Social Security may be waiting to see if your condition is going to improve prior to the 12 months.|`|RMGzjECmaa	SUE them for all they have|`|cMssi4qraa	I applied too, still waiting on first answer. It sucks to have to hire a lawyer cuz they will take 25% of back earnings from date u applied but from what I understand you only get three denials then u are out of luck. there are companies out there that specialize in this. One such is called ALLSUP. they say they have a succsess rate of 98%. I wld strongly consider at this point hiring a lawyer/company that specializes in this. just make sure u ask what their succsess rate is. good luck|`|GqDmkAl3aa	Apply for disability.

As for bonuses you will have to talk to a recruiter. I recommend just doing a 2 year enlistment, if you like it then reenlist.  I also would like to add that we did two field deployments a year and a gunnery rotation. These consist of a 30-45 day rotation on your base. Then you will go to the NTC in Ft Irwin Ca for 45 days. After that you will be ready and trained as a unit to be deployed. I was in 3 years and never got deployed over seas.

He served several years in prison, had to register as a sex offender, and has spent the rest of his life being discriminated against, even though he is a God fearing Christian who did something stupid when he was  19.<br>  Point is, we need to clear up what a sex offender actually is.

AA11565538	Once you send your application forms then a file is created for you, they are referring to that kind of file.<br>  If you went to your appointment and they did not have your file then it's their mistake.

d24525de43ba28019e73bdec2b08f385aa	How about 5th Amendment takings?  Local governments routinely take land from innocent landowners who seek only to build on their property.  Or they have "redevelopment agencies" who decide for entire neighborhoods how the land is going to be used, who will have to move out of their homes to accommodate their grand plans, and what value, if any, is due those who are displaced.<br>  <br>  The takings clause of the 5th amendment reads as follows:  "Private property shall not be taken for a public use, without just compensation."  That means your property is yours, and the government can't take it from you without good cause and without paying a fair price for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  See Kelo v. City of New London, one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in a generation, which held that the City could use its eminent domain powers to force an entire neighborhood out of their homes.  Why?  Because the City had plans to turn the land over to private developers to make it more "profitable" and generate more tax revenue.  <br>  <br>  The law currently gives local City Councils a license to steal.

4VOTwqgPaa	Hey hey hey I live in Mexico. Monterrey to be exact, and I attend the Tecnológico de Monterrey.<br>  <br>  While it's true that violence has escalated lately, usually if you have nothing to do with the drug cartels (or keep a low profile in general) you won't get targeted. It's also true that killings have multiplied, but the media has also blown it out of proportion like it tends to do all the time.<br>  <br>  What you have to do if you want to be safe is always being in well-lit crowded areas, don't be out after 3 am, and stay away from suspicious looking people/cars. The city is so big and so full of people that you'll hardly be noticed, so don't freak out so much. You're one in like 5 million people xD I should probably be more afraid than you hehe I mean, I live here!<br>  <br>  Most people here speak good english, better than in other parts of Mexico, actually, so you should hardly have a problem with language. There's a US family living in my block, actually, and while their spanish isn't very good they've never had a problem.<br>  <br>  There's several exchange students from the US in my university, and they all seem to be having a blast. There's no denying that nightlife here is fantastic (not to be a show off, but we do have a certain... spark). There's paseo santa lucia, fundidora, museo marco, cola de caballo, barrio antiguo, la macroplaza, all of our mountains, malls, cinemas, "discos" (we call them antros), restaurants of everything.... and if you're feeling like exploring then you have Villa de Santiago or Saltillo just 45 minutes away. Villa de Santiago has just been labeled a magical town heehee we also have several things you have back home: burger king, mcdonald's, carl's jr, wendy's, HEB, waltmart, cinemark.... should you feel homesick =P<br>  <br>  The weather though... you haven't been here if you haven't felt our high temperatures and random rainy days. If ever the weather channel tells you there's going to be rain..... never believe them. We're probably going to hit 100 F.<br>  <br>  Welcome to Monterrey!|`|4TT8lSgwaa	Mexico is not safe to go as a student. Unlike tourists, a student has  to access more local unprotected areas and people. It will be far much safer and more to learn if you choose Hong Kong.

It affects you psycologically and may be weepy and very upset afterwards as your hormones will be all over the place.  I suggest you speak to your doctor and make sure you don't end up in this predicament again.  By the way 16 is the legal age in UK so your boyfriend could get prosecuted for having sex with a minor|`|CVVl4U4caa	You are kid, so no, you won't be able to without the consent of your parents.

Here in the U.S. they are legally required to sell contraception to anyone, any age.|`|7utsLRfyaa	yes<br>  well the abortion, it can be done without your parents although they are supposed to know if you are under 16 but sometimes they dont tell ur parents|`|vDC8TXJraa	hey.....<br>  <br>  yea you can do both. You will have to go to the doctors for both anyway, and everything that happens at the doctors is private and confidential. I never told my parents when i was 15, and i went to the doctors to get the pill. Its illegal for the doctors to tell anyone about your personal issues, including your parents. The doctor may try and persuade you to tell your parents but if you dont want them to know, the doctor does not have the right to do so without your permission. I know what its like not wanting to tell your parents things like that, its hard, but its always better in the long run if you tell them, just wait until you are ready. But just do whats right for yourself, and dont let anyone tell you and different. Its your life, just do what makes you happy :) some decisions that you will make may be the hardest choices you'll ever had to make, but be true with yourself about what you want. You will get the odd person telling you things you dont want to hear, but just block their voice out of your head and listen to your heart :) good luck x|`|6Vaaqle0aa	I think you can have abortions below 16 without consent nowadays.<br>  Providing that you tell teh Doctors they are not allowed to contact your parents.<br>  <br>  Obviouskly, you should think strongly about making this decision and make sure it's the right thing.<br>  Whatever people say, it's your choice. So many people are against abortions it doesn't matter what the majority say, whatever is best for you and no-one else.<br>  Keep that in mind, if you can't cope and know it's the wrong time, have the termination. But if you feel you cannot do it, keep the child and tell your parents.<br>  <br>  In the end, it's compeltely your decision.|`|1a87f22d5f2d39d5a173be77e43a2a99aa	Yes,<br>  <br>  Abortion: ending the pregnancy<br>  <br>  What happens if I decide to have an abortion?<br>  <br>  Firstly, see your GP, Brook Clinic or local family planning clinic for information about the type of abortion available to you.<br>  <br>  They will help you cope with what you are going through and help you make the right decision. A doctor or counsellor will discuss if you want your parents to know about your abortion.<br>  <br>  While you can give consent (agree to an abortion) under 16, if you do not want to tell your parents, a doctor will only give the go ahead if she/he believes you understand what's involved.<br>  <br>  Even if a doctor agrees, they may still encourage you to involve a parent (although they will not involve your parents without your permission).|`|n7noPV7Aaa	I doubt it seeing as you are not above the age of consent. You were/are not supposed to be having sex. I think the age limit might be 16 in the UK but I'm not sure because I don't live there. By the way, if you were ready for sex you would have checked this out already. If you are pregnant talk to your parents. Don't go it alone, thats just stupid. And another thing, if you are pregnant then the father has a right to know before you kill his baby.|`|vJ6GI7oIaa	Yes. It's perfectly legal, despite being under the age of consent (16). If she wants the morning after pill, it's best to go to the doctor - without prescription costs ￡25. But yes, she can get an abortion/contraception without consent.|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	Yes, it is legal as long as she is 'gillick competent', that is she knows and understands what she is doing and it's repercussions.

PERSONAL APPEARANCE.  Because it is impossible to provide examples of every appropriate or unacceptable hairstyle or of “conservative” or “eccentric” grooming and personal appearance, the good judgment of leaders at all levels is key to enforcement of Navy grooming policy.  Therefore, hair/grooming/personal appearance while in uniform shall present a neat, professional appearance.<br>  <br>  1.  HAIR<br>  b.  Women.  Hairstyles shall not be outrageously multicolored or faddish, to include shaved portions of the scalp (other than the neckline), or have designs cut or braided into the hair.  Hair coloring must look natural and complement the individual.  Haircuts and styles shall present a balanced appearance.  Lopsided and extremely asymmetrical styles are not authorized.  Ponytails, pigtails, widely spaced individual hanging locks, and braids which protrude from the head, are not authorized.  Multiple braids are authorized.  Braided hairstyles shall be conservative and conform to the guidelines listed herein.  When a hairstyle of multiple braids is worn, braids shall be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approx. 1/4 inch), and tightly interwoven to present a neat, professional, well groomed appearance.  Foreign material (i.e., beads, decorative items) shall not be braided into the hair.  Short hair may be braided in symmetrical fore and aft rows (corn rowing) which minimize scalp exposure.  Corn row ends shall not protrude from the head, and shall be secured only with inconspicuous rubber bands that match the color of the hair.  Appropriateness of a hairstyle shall also be judged by its appearance when headgear is worn.  All headgear shall fit snugly and comfortably around the largest part of the head without distortion or excessive gaps.  Hair shall not show from under the front of the brim of the combination hat, garrison, or command ball caps.  Hairstyles which do not allow headgear to be worn in this manner, or which interfere with the proper wear of protective masks or equipment are prohibited.  When in uniform, the hair may touch, but not fall below a horizontal line level with the lower edge of the back of the collar.  With jumper uniforms, hair may extend a maximum of 1-1/2 inches below the top of the jumper collar.  Long hair, including braids, which fall below the lower edge of the collar shall be neatly and inconspicuously fastened, pinned, or secured to the head.  No portion of the bulk of the hair as measured from the scalp will exceed approximately 2 inches.  <Figure 2-2-2> refers.  A maximum of two small barrettes/combs/  clips, similar to hair color, may be used in the hair. Additional bobby pins or rubber bands matching hair color may be used to hold hair in place, if necessary.  Fabric elastics and colored rubber bands/pins are not authorized.  Hair ornaments shall not present a safety or FOD (Foreign Object Damage) hazard.  Hair nets shall not be worn unless authorized for a specific type of duty.|`|0h9aD7Toaa	They have a special beauty shop there very well equipped, they will cut it to just the right length, they won't wash it though, you have to do that later.|`|PneJExFxaa	Hi, I am in the Army.  For us, haircuts were not required or given in basic training.  I imagine the standards are similar.  If your hair is cut short, it must be above the collar of your uniform.  If it is long, it must be secured back (typically in a bun) and pinned or held down with elastic bands that match your hair color.  No extreme hair colors, of course.  It is all listed in an Army regulation.  You may want to look it up online and see if the Navy lists its regulations for uniform appearance, I would guess you could find it.|`|yOfYa6Nmaa	You will get a free one at boot camp, save your money.<br>  <br>  When in uniform, the hair may touch, but not fall below a horizontal line level with the lower edge of the back of the collar.

No portion of the bulk of the hair as measured from the scalp will exceed approximately 2 inches.|`|fSrmGhOfaa	Hmmm.... somebody looks up the Navy Regulations that govern the very topick of the question... and he gets a "Thumbs Down"?

qEp9fxU9aa	From a local standpoint some counties post this information though some do not.  Some require you to go to the court house in person.  Some have offsite locations where you can access this information and some have this information posted on the internet.  It depends on where the crime was committed.  It's very diffilcult to search for this information because even if you know the person's name, etc. this type of info usually doesn't show up in a basic search.  Go to the counties in and around where the person lived or where you think a crime or crimes may have been committed and search their .gov database.  Call them and they may look it up for you as well though this will take some additional work above and beyond just putting someone's name in google.|`|z4FZlLxyaa	you better off going to the local court building.<br>  those websites are a waste of time and most of them are scams <br>  telling you to pay for unliminted access to public records.|`|AA11376640	county clerk, take your credit card, I think it is 6 dollars a page here in Kentucky!

The lawyer who was hired by the estate should be willing to help, seeing that he was supposed to execute the estate, which includes the debts.|`|yaaNbLeyaa	Typically all debts have to be settled before distribution of assets.  If there's debt and no cash in the estate to pay them, any assets will be sold and the money generated will be used to pay debts first.  Anything left over after that will go to heirs.  You're not responsible for her outstanding debts - her estate is - so you won't be paying anything to settle them.  You may not actually inherit anything, though, depending on how much she owes and what the mobile home, van and stocks are worth.  I'm afraid the estate lawyer is correct - and he ought to be.

It depends what branch though. If it's Marines its 13 weeks [my brother graduated boot camp for the Marines in Parris Island in August 2008], for the Air Force its 8.5 weeks [my bf is there now, and graduates March 6th! Left Jan 5th] and for the Army I believe it's 9 weeks and for the Navy I think it's 8 or 9 weeks. But after boot camp/basic, they go to "school" for their specified job in the military and can be stationed as close or as far away from home.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	It depends on what branch and what job he chooses. I'm an Army Infantryman so I did 16 weeks in Fort Benning, Georgia. I also did One Station Unit Training which is Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training combined.|`|214621b9e16728aa03fa904b0f6c597daa	If he is joining the army then about ten weeks, Marines are around 12 weeks and i am not sure about the other branches.|`|AA12305234	6, 8 or 12 wks|`|nRAB0tl8aa	I think his MOS will also be a factor, because from what i have read MP's dont get leave after bootcamp they go straight into their MOS training

jh9iPYvXaa	You should start by asking the judge for an extension, since any new lawyer will need time to review the facts.<br>  <br>  But more importantly - why wouldn't your last lawyer represent you? This may be a subtle hint that what you're asking for isn't reasonable or right. I encourage you to try to work things out with your children's father - I believe it's usually best when both parents stay involved in their children's lives.<br>  <br>  Additional:<br>  Based on your update, it's very unusual for a mom who's been involved throughout the children's lives, with no drug or alcohol problems, to get so little custody. One thing to be sure of - DONT move out of the house! If you walk away from your kids, you give up a lot. Make sure there's an agreement before you move out.

RkfIPD7Iaa	What do you mean 'buy a copyright'?  You mean buy it off someone who currently owns it? Or do you just mean register a trademark name?  If you do that, you have to specify in what area the name is to be trademarked.  It's very unlikely you'd be able to trademark it as a universal trademark (usable in all fields) unless you could also show you were USING it in all fields.<br>  <br>  If you have a legally registered name, you could possibly try to stop a website from using the name, but if they existed before your registration, in all likelihood it would be THEM suing you for using their name.<br>  <br>  You can't gain rights to already existing products, trademarks, or copyrights this way, no.

Zm8sQpKLaa	No you can't. I don't wear a helmet either, but I carry one on long interstate truips JUST for this very reason.<br>  <br>  If you are planning a long trip, then familiarize yourself with the helmet laws in each state you are traveling to<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ama-cycle.org/legisltn/laws.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ama-cycle.org/legisltn/laws.a...</a><br>  <br>  Try that site for info,<br>  <br>  For all those who are ignorant enough to do nothing more than make stupid comments about riding withoput a helmet, I have been riding without one since the ridiculous law was repealedm got a lot of years under my belt and a lot of years to go.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	No you cannot.  You are expected to know the driving laws in the state you are in.<br>  <br>  If there is a variation from state to state, they usually post signs quite prominently at the border.<br>  <br>  BTW, your state did AWAY with helmet laws?

Most states with helmet laws seem to have a sign as you're on your way over the border.  But no matter what, if you're going cross country, you need to have a helmet.  Your best bet is to stop at gas stations prior to crossing the border and ask the attendant there if you're not sure.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You are responsible for obeying the laws wherever you are.

yQ0OzEbZaa	School choice took a hit this week, as the "omnibus" spending bill stipulates that any future funding for the D.C.

nwMBfgcdaa	The first female police officer was in the Canada, was Rose Fortune.  <br>  <a href="http://www.famouscanadians.net/name/f/fortunerose.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.famouscanadians.net/name/f/fo...</a><br>  <br>  In the 1970s, I believe, the first females went through RCMP depot.  They actually work skirts on duty and were assigned a purse that was designed to carry a gun (i saw one at an auction). <br>  Women were not welcome with open arms.  Its alot easier now, but I would still hestitate to say its equal.  I frequently get asked where my partner is and if I am scared to be alone.  <br>  There are women in ERT (emergency response team, Canada's version of SWAT).  I don't know what the numbers are but I do know one personally in New Brunswick.  I know female K9 officers, Criminal Profiles, Inspectors, Chiefs of Police.

abJFBd7daa	There are over 200 million firearms owned by private citizens in the United States meaning that if they were distributed evenly between every man woman and child, six and one half people out of 10 could be armed. Winchester is responsible for producing over 7,500,000 models of 1894 variant 30/30’. (That’s one model!)<br>  <br>  If you consider that the life time production of the AK series of rifles that has been in production, with licenses to build the weapon in 19 different countries, there have been 30-50 million AK 47 rifles including their civilian variants (permanently set to semi-automatic) that have been produced and have become a marketable rifle in this country.<br>  <br>  Any foreign power seriously considering an invasion of the US mainland is forced to consider the potential resistance of a population that is armed the way that we are. With an estimated 4-5 million modern military arms plus the additional 200 million arms of our citizens, occupation by conventional warfare isn’t a viable option. <br>  <br>  The ability to possess arms in this country has been a long standing tradition that has been complicated by those who have an ulterior motive to fit their dark agenda. While not every unfortunate victim of violence is anti-gun, it is hoped by certain individuals that the population will perceive the subject in this manner. Inundating the population with headlines about senseless murders and robberies may have had an impact on some but I still believe the majority of the people are smart enough to figure out that laws do not protect anyone from someone willing to break the law. The events of the Blacksburg college campus shooting in Virginia come to mind of just such a case. How does the creation of a law addressing that shooting prevent another’s death? What kind of person who would kill another be stopped by a restrictive firearm policy on campus? We never hear about shootings at rifle ranges or gun shops, police stations or gun shows. Why? Isn’t it possible that as deranged as the people are who are bent on violence understand that they will be gunned down by those who will defend themselves and other innocent victims? <br>  <br>  If restrictions of firearm ownership make the population safer why has Washington DC been the murder capitol of this country for so many years? If laws were effective at preventing crime why are kids being shot at schools where possession of a fire arm is illegal on school property? <br>  <br>  You asked, “What can other occupied countries learn from the USA?” There are bad people all over the world who will take advantage of others just as they do in DC where the people are disarmed like in so many other countries in the world. People here in the United States are given choices that could potentially be misused but generally speaking, the area’s of the country who have large numbers of arms are defiantly safer than those without. Imagine the government of any nation whose leadership conducted the business of the people knowing that the people had the ability to fight back? Would there have been a Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy or communist Russia?  People all over the world only want to wake up and earn a decent living, see that there kids get a proper education, live in safe communities and maybe at some point retire and enjoy the few years they have left. How many human beings dream about that in the Gaza Strip? Could we credit this basic idea of life and family, jobs and security to what we have seen in Iraq from the grand majority of the population who only want to get on with the business of living? With this knowledge, giving armed people choices to fabricate their own governments as they see fit would go along way in creating stability. Those who abuse the privilege of such authority would suffer the consequences either by passive removal or armed ejection  while those who don’t would busy themselves with the before mentioned desires shared by the rest of us. Violence is not a pleasant subject to think about and even less appealing to be a part of but it does exist and we have to deal with it. I believe there is a misnomer about guns in this country and it will be our undoing if it is allowed to continue. Firearms don’t make our society savage, they make us responsible. Firearms don’t make us murderers but defenders of life and ourselves and they don’t tear a society apart but instead make it more cohesive.|`|zWU2skZTaa	The British/Canadians briefly occupied Washington DC and burned the White House during the War of 1812.|`|zze8XmjLaa	Yes, count on it.

Q4NFFBizaa	obviously not if we have to keep putting money into it. Its kinda like your beater car you drive it into the ground and then you pay a lot of money to fix it but no matter what gets fixed it never stays that way long and you just keep throwing money to the mechanic without any longterm results. I think its sad the government is giving away free money like this. Billions and billions of our dollars down the drain, for nothing. It has in no way helped our economy in any way. Obviously the management teams at these companies are not doing a good job if they are asking the government for money. Yet they still remain on as CEO's and Board of Directors and such with their lavish wages and yet they are running their company into the ground. I say let them fail, and spend that 750 billion dollars on education!|`|J1I8sSkpaa	They really are just trying to stop the financial engine from crashing so its really hard to say if they work or not without knowing a bunch of stuff that we do not.<br>  <br>  Basically if they work they work in the way that they prevented even worse things from happening rather than actually making it better from what everyone is used to.<br>  <br>  It really is the kind of decisions that's probably necessary but definitely not popular with the general population (who can't really grasp or see the effects of what all this money did).|`|oTAPazvcaa	If you do the same thing over, and over, and expect a different result that my friend is insanity.|`|iYjA51rjaa	The sensible thing to do would be to tell the Banks to negotiate with the homeowners.

Keep it vague, keep it lofty, but never give any details of how the problems will be fixed.|`|k1W70RHFaa	Because most people think the automobile was invented in america.<br>  Obama did not say "the modern automobile" he said automobile.<br>  <br>  And he was clearly wrong.<br>  <br>  Read the wikipedia article on it, many, many designs were made in Europe, the earliest ones from the 1700s.|`|WiFQbtgIaa	I think Obama believes that George Washington Carver (who was a great inventor) invented one out of peanuts long before German Karl Benz did.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	He flunked history, he actually thought Henry Ford who introduced mass production of the auto was the the Man, he was feeling for Detroit.

cR1M8ALyaa	Well, the republicans think it's okay to say crap like that on democrats, but if we say a republican was hitler, we're WRONG!<br>  <br>  In short : Republicans are hypocrites.<br>  <br>  I guess anyone who is a good speaker is Hitler himself.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	People compared Bush to Hitler too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ecosyn.us/Bush-Hitler/" rel="nofollow">http://ecosyn.us/Bush-Hitler/</a>|`|RVdAXPDRaa	Stop & think about how Hitler was respected & loved by the German people , AT FIRST. They did not love him shortly after he took over completely. I think the comparison was made due to the fact that Obama has been able to cast a spell over so many of the American people just as Hitler did the German people. Let's wait a while & see what comes of this country under Mr. Obama. I hope it becomes what we all hope it will become. There is no hate for Mr. Obama in this answer, only hope.|`|TQYQUNYHaa	When a great speaker is a great speaker he can become anything he wants to become.

That is about as far as I would go with it though.  I suppose if you were writing a paper about powerful speakers, their influences on people, their affects then you would compare/contrast the two.  Still, you would have to make it clear that it was in speaking only.  No one can deny that Hitler was a great and charasmatic speaker for Nazi Germany but you cannot say that Obama was a piece of scum like him.  I have to wonder,not that I am defending the person, that that was their intent...to say that Hitler and Obama were inspiring and assuring speakers.<br>  <br>  DRAGON 2012<br>  "Great fortune for U.S."|`|mbvE0zTcaa	Probably for the same reasons you democrats did it. The same name  was used against Bush but for different reasons. Does it sting? Does it hurt, well welcome to the world of politics. Of all the names I can think to call our new president, that one would be mild. When O.B.A.M.A. was elected I asked the same question, how do these morons get elected? Your last statement is to moronic to even comment on.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	The fact that people do not bury the name of a long dead failure it the reason we keep hate alive.

Like your new pic better. LOL|`|jtDChHNwaa	that just shows you how far people can carry their hatred|`|3caq6SFxaa	I think you are mistaken things said with comparison-JFK, FDR, Reagan were great speakers and actually said things and stated their beliefs.  Too many supporters of the President were constantly remarking on his abilities as a speaker but really did not know what he stood for besides "hope and change"; he is a great speaker who says very little when you look at what he intends to do.  The comparison is a person can be a great speaker but that does not mean he is a great person-you listen to a Ronald Regan speech or FDR and, agree with them or not, you know where they stood on issues.  The same was true of JFK and, to a lesser degree, Clinton but it is not true of President Obama.  The answer to President Obama is a great speaker is some times so was Hitler because I don't see what he stands for besides campaign words that are meaningless.  Champion of bringing people and bipartisanship were some of his great promises but the Democrats have been anything but-President Obama having Republicans in the White House for tea is not partisanship but photo opportunity; now if he had the Congressional leadership both involved in writing bills that would be bipartetanship but Rep Pelosi has not allowed that and no pressure has been put on her to do that by the President.  Yes he could say I want the members of both parties involved in writing the bill and then if she doesn't do it he tried but he hasn't but has just taken cheap shots because the Republicans point out they have been left totally out of the process and no that has not happened often in the past and never for the spending or health of the nation involved as the bills in this Congress have done.  The Democrats have had a majority since 2006 but not the Presidency which means President Bush had to operate in a bipartisan way to a degree and so did they.  Now they have it all and do not want any input or any discussion just my way or you are hurting the system, hurting Americans, being obstructionist and so forth.  The last time this happened it lasted two years and the Democrats lost control of both chambers of Congress for exactly that reason-they should learn from history because most Americans do believe in fair play and if President Obama is not to blame for the lack of bipartisanship then it is the Democratic leadership in Congress..|`|eR8uVnQcaa	you can compare anyone with anyone.  For example, Hitler and Obama both have two legs.  Hitler was the leader of a country which murdered ten million people and killed tens of millions more in a war.  Obama is the leader of a country which murders hundreds of thousands of persons (if you include fetuses) each year and is involved in low level wars with a few thousand deaths each year and has thousands of nuclear missiles and might possibly use them in big atomic war which kills hundreds of millions of person sometime during his presidency.|`|AA11156037	Easily when we are comparing oratory skills, it is CERTAINLY within free speech (has the 1st Amendment been suspended YET?) to put HITLER and OBAMA together.<br>  <br>  Remember the absolute adoration for Comrade Obama during the election.  People were throwing the RACE card around and demanding that 'Republicans just get with the program' and vote Obama because it was the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  I have watched the old tapes of Hitler campaigning, his bombastic rhetoric and I admire his ability to "say nothing of substance in volumes". Obama has that same charisma and enchanting value in his speeches.<br>  <br>  If you go to The Obama Forum. org (delete spaces) you will find that his VERY own Internet-based Gestapo rat database is WELL under development.   Actually more like the old People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB) (predecessor of the KGB) than the Gestapo. <br>  <br>  But yes, babe, I do dislike him INTENSELY BUT I do not HATE BHO.  I see a lot of HATE out here and most of if I see as coming from the Left.  Too much from the Right for sure but GOD help you when you fail to idolize Comrade Obama. <br>  <br>  I could come to love the man, if he JUST resigned and went back to being a local politician in Chicago with a part-time gig as a dog-catcher for Cook County. That fits so much better for Obama.|`|MCloUy2Faa	The crazy right wingers have no conscience.|`|Pp51J2WTaa	Obama should not be president and will f<>k this country up. Pelosi is his main backer.

I hate it when people cannot see that my idea of the american dream is slipping away for my children and they cannot make a connection to things like both legal and illegal immigration being a major affect to that. <br>  Immigrants both legal and illegal kill the American dream for the rest of us...They may be happy working for 7.00 an hour with no benefits  the rest of us aren't! That may be their idea of the american dream but its not to the rest of us!<br>  With the shape our economy is in right now we don't need them here!<br>  They drive wages down and demand to many social services from our government!<br>  We need to start taking care of our own poor before we take care of  the poor of other nations. That's not hate its just self preservation.|`|25DwuEYlaa	I find it interesting that the same old argument about "Lazy Americans" on welfare always comes up during these discussions. The really ironic part iis that the same people who complain about it as a means of justifying illegal immigration are ALSO the same people who constantly vote for those people who support and increase these entitlement programs. Obviously, they have no problem with these programs or the people who avail themselves of them. They're just showing their hypocrisy.|`|eYpE4bp2aa	I agree with you totally. <br>  <br>  People are so stupid in this country and as soon as they hear the word "immigrant" they automatically think "illegal immigrant" and begin spewing their hate.

The hispanics are taking the jobs that we don't want like construction, restaurant,milking cows,chopping cutting housing and stripping tobacco. If some of these people actually sat down and talked to a hispanic then maby they would have a different look on them. Compare the work, and crime rate with hispanics and blacks and see what u get. in some states it might be different my in my state blacks are ranked #1 in crime, unemployment,robbery,murders,jails,priso... everything else under the fu**ing sun.
K2ecmzInaa	No, they will begin in fighting to figure who to point the finger at. And yes, this stimulus plan will fail since it is going to bring Inflation that hasn't been seen since the Depression.|`|ITF52tu9aa	I would blame both. Obama at least takes responsibility for his actions. <br>  <br>  Obama is obviously delving into uncharted waters. Today and the time of FDR are very different. I would not want to be in his shoes. Yet the Republican's suggestions of alternative plans have been awful. The Democratic solution- while not terrible (very bad), I'm not inspired with confidence. <br>  <br>  We'll just have to wait and see. But not doing anything is even worse. <br>  <br>  As far as George who retires to wealth and multimillion dollar speaking tours? Bush's laxity and playing ostrich led to much of this, and he also exhausted the treasury by committing to a war on two fronts- a strategic no no which was only a win for his contractor friends. Perhaps they should ante up for their portion of the stimulus package.|`|zb2EwgKVaa	i was under the impression thats all they knew.

And GWB is a very good reason as to why that family should cease breeding immediately.  That is a gene pool that needs to come to a complete halt.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	First off the fault is the international banking system and most especially the American banking system that lobbied for sub-prime mortgages.  The bankers put on a hard sell an Clinton allowed the sub-prime mortgage game to begin.<br>  <br>  People were pushed by banker's sales people to get inti the sub-prime mortgages and they sold a lot.  These loans then worked through the banks and into the International banking system during the Bush years.  Though there were hints of a coming crises Bush didn't bother with it because, of course, banks are republican for the most part.  So the crises grew.<br>  <br>  Bush then made a bail out of billions for the rich bankers and this was supposed to stimulate the economy.  That was pure BS because the economy can't be stimulated from the top.  Sure the bankers have more money to lend but by this time their is b no one safe to lend to because the people near the bottom that spend the money have become broke and/or careful.<br>  <br>  At the same time Bush spent more and more money increasing the country's debt by a great margin.  He ran the country out of money five times in his eight years in office.  He went and begged congress for a higher borrowing limit five times while he continued to increase expenditures.  Not only financing two foolish wars but building a $750 million dollar embassy complex in Iraq and other daft spending.<br>  <br>  He created the biggest and most costly government bureaucracy ever when he created the mind-boggling Homeland Security department.<br>  <br>  Now, Americans, please remember there's a big world out there other than the US and Iraq.  The rest of the world also is in bad shape and Europe failed by giving banks bailouts too.  Thought they were smarter than that!<br>  <br>  So, though Obama's plan is not perfect because like most government endeavors, it is a plan by committee.  This is a difficulty with democracy we must live with as no system is better yet.<br>  <br>  But, Obama's plan tries to go to the root of the system where all economies must begin - the working class people.  Once the working class people have the freedom to spend again the money will percolate through all of society and the mend will be started.  Obama has done right for the people of the US.  If one wishes a good crop one must stimulate the roots.<br>  <br>  The other problem is that our world is all tied together in a near globalization.  For Obama's stimulus to work fully so mush the stimulus packages in other countries.  If not then we could slide again.|`|ybLErb9caa	Actually no because Obama said that he would accept responsibility unlike Bush.Obama came out and said that he screwed up with some of his cabinet picks.Bush wouldn't admit that he screwed up if he wore mismatched socks.

Two wrongs make a right to them I guess.|`|jTUyBO6baa	"How can Republicans criticize his spending w/ a straight face after the amount of cash Bushie burned through?"<br>  <br>  Because most Republicans criticized bush's extravagant spending too. <br>  <br>  Instead of criticizing the Republicans for criticizing Obama's spending, shouldnt you be criticizing Obama's spending too? Or if you're all for Obama's spending, then shouldn't you keep quiet about Bush's spending? <br>  <br>  "Shouldn't we at least wait until he doubles the debt too?"<br>  <br>  No. By then it will be too late.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	What I want to know is how you can even post this with a straight face given the fact that Obama has proposed 2 trillion in spending only having been in office a little over 30 days ? Bush nor any president in all of history comes even close to the money this schmuck is blowing, And he says in his own words, That this is only the beginning. God bless.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Most Republicans I know heavily criticized GWB's stimulus spending, both times.  They're a bit divided on the war spending.  Some support the idea of the Afghanistan front but not Iraq and some support both.  I'm sure there are a handful that don't support either.  Many are slowly coming around to believing it's gone on for entirely too long.|`|bZy74U06aa	Real Conservatives like me were very critical of President Bush's liberal spending habits.  We criticize Obama because he's doing the same thing except on a MUCH larger scale.<br>  <br>  My question to you is if liberals bashed Bush for his spending why don't they hold Obama to the same standards?|`|A2kAfEyRaa	Doug... doug... doug....<br>  <br>  The exact reason you used "Our debt is 11 Trillon. Obama adding another trillion doesn't double our debt." has me VERY VERY scared.<br>  <br>  Take a look at this graph (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123564748462081261.html#project%3DOBAMABUDGET09%26articleTabs%3Dinteractive)" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12356474...</a> and go to the "Deficits/Surpluses" tab. Just take a few seconds to fimilarize yourself with the HUGE difference between the Bush administation and what Obama has just accomplished.<br>  <br>  Now... the issue is not that we are adding over 1 trillion to our overall deficit... its just that what took 8 years to accomplish with Bush's "out of control spending" of this kind of debt.. Obama just spent more than Bush's accumilated total debt in less than 30 days in office.<br>  <br>  He has more than tripled the deficit of Bush administration's WORST deficit year. Bush was not spending out of control. He was spending a lot... but at the end of the day he was only spending about 500 billion over the government's tax revenue... where is Obama just spent 3x that amount. <br>  <br>  I think we should all be very scared right now! Unemployment is rising with no immediate stop in sight AND the government is spending money with absolutely no care about who is going to pay for it. Because I promise you... you try to squeeze it out of the top 2% of the richest people you will find they relocate to another country and our country fails period.<br>  <br>  If you were that 2%... how would you react to having to pay back 1.5 trillion dollars through taxes? Because he promised everyone else that their taxes won't increase...I'm sure you would pack up your stuff and move to a nice warm island live out the rest of your days in luxury. Point is... Obama thinks they are just going to take this.... it won't happen and I won't blame them if they just give the finger and walk away.<br>  <br>  THANKS OBAMA!|`|EJVKqFiHaa	He added 20% in a month. He still has 47 months to go.

8ZUs3qxxaa	Right. Bush had eight years. Obama's barely gotten started. We don't know how the stimulus package will turn out (probably not the best option, but at least something like a try is happening) or anything.<br>  <br>  As for bigger deficits, Obama inherited that from Bush. And bigger governments...at least it looks more competent and promising than Bush's did. And what do people want? A tiny little weak government that watches the country collapse while sipping tea? You have to have some regulation. That's the point of a government anyway. And how is our current government a dictatorship? Seriously.<br>  <br>  And are you one of those people who think that all government is the devil who's trying to take away the innocent people's money and joy? Or are you just kind of really cynical?|`|k8n05Wk5aa	i dont think that comparison is at all accurate. bush was for smaller government, didnt like the idea of a stimulus plan that much and gave us tax cuts as soon as he got into office. <br>  obama let those tax cuts lapse, initiated another stimulus package in order to keep campaign promises and expand the size of government programs under the name of saving the economy. <br>  <br>  my opinion: bush wasnt definately not perfect but for the most part made the hard decisions and did what needed to be done according to the information at hand at the time. <br>  dont forget 9/11 when he had one of the highest presidential approval ratings in history. problem was a few months later people realized that wars cost money and lives and changed their minds. the dems opposed him and the liberally biased media crucified him.<br>  <br>  as for obama, he should have learned how to deal with a bad economy from reagan, which would be doing the exact opposite of everything he has been doing. <br>  reagan shrunk the gov't and cut taxes and it worked. obamas doing the opposite and i hope to hell im wrong about it being a bad idea!|`|FKDv6ycbaa	largest ear's ever on a human being, related to dumbo.|`|535812a50f219760f8422e72a97882abaa	obama is nothing but bush squared. more of the same bad government.|`|YgRfcx1oaa	idk, the girl above me is drunk, ignore her comments.|`|IUw5Z395aa	The difference between the 2:<br>  <br>  Bush spent like there was no tomorrow<br>  <br>  Obama INVESTS (through spending) because if he doesn't [A LOT ], there is no tomorrow|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	I was just thinking the same thing!|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	1.

We'll see if he's able to follow through on it.  Still, I don't approve of the amount of money he's spending, or the degree of socialism he's attempting.<br>  <br>  Foreign Policy:  This is where I think Obama is FAR better than Bush.  Bush had a "shoot now, ask questions later" policy, invaded the wrong COUNTRY, and thought that diplomacy was a waste of time.  There are now MORE people in the world who want to harm the US because of Bush's policies.<br>  <br>  Social Rights:  Obama SLIGHTLY edges out Bush here.  While Bush was the one who introduced the Patriot Act, Guananimo, tapping our own citizens, & opposing gay marraige...Obama went along with some of it.  I DO think he's going in the right direction now with closing Guantanimo, but we'll see how straigt a course he takes.

i5FP4Vbraa	Most Americans fear Socialism and think that it somehow has something to do with Communism, well it plainly does not.<br>  <br>  I cannot speak of other nations, but in the EU in all countries thereof, they all have their own form of social medicare.<br>  <br>  How is it paid for?<br>  <br>  Every citizen here in UK and their employer [in the case of employees] pay a monthly fee which we call National Insurance.  This is deducted from the salary at source monthly.<br>  <br>  How much is this National Insurance?<br>  <br>  It depends upon how much salary a person is paid.  But on average it is usually about ￡40 to ￡60 a month for the average worker.  The employer pays a similar sum per employee.<br>  <br>  What does this National Insurance pay for?<br>  <br>  It pays for all of a person's hospital bills and general care.  A citizen can choose their own doctor, they can even have private medical insurance if they wish, but they must have National Insurance - it's the law.<br>  <br>  I'm now 68 years old, born 1941.  I no longer pay National Insurance nor do I pay for any prescriptions.<br>  <br>  What does my National Insurance get me, now that I'm retired?<br>  <br>  In addition to free at point of need medicare - no fees ever, I also receive the United Kingdom State Pension - which every woman receives from age 60 and every man from age 65.  <br>  <br>  Most of my generation also have private and/or company pensions, plus savings from which they earn interest to back up their incomes.<br>  I'm actually now better off than when I was working - strange but true.  Mainly this is due to the fact that upon retirement the amount of tax a pensioner pays is negligible - I pay no income tax worth mentioning.<br>  <br>  Americans can choose for themselves.<br>  <br>  One thing which many Americans seem entirely unaware of is that Corporate America is very much in favour of social medicare.  Why?  At the present time Coporate America is paying the full cost in terms of insurance for it's workers.  Under a social medicare system such as the British National Health Service [National Insurance], the cost is shared between the employee and the employer.  Thus, were there to be a National Insurance scheme in the USA, the cost of it would be halved for Corporate America.<br>  <br>  Americans are free to choose their own destiny, but they should think and not just react to something about which they really know very little.<br>  <br>  Americans might care to check out the Nordic Model of social care - it works.  Is Sweden a Communist country?  No.  Yet it has possibly the world's best social welfare system.<br>  <br>  NHS DIRECT - free medical advice for all.<br>  <a href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/</a><br>  <br>  History of the National Health Service - Care for all the people from the cradle to the grave.<br>  <a href="http://www.nhshistory.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhshistory.net/</a><br>  <br>  I was in hospital four weeks ago having a bladder operation.  I was in a ward once managed by Florence Nightingale - I knew she was there.  The service I got was brilliant.

When you have state funding from UK Government, there is no shortage of anything and nothing is ever too much bother either.<br>  <br>  An old man in a bed opposite me was fed and nursed every day by three nurses.

He died in his sleep with his nurses fussing over him.<br>  <br>  Goodbye old soldier. . .|`|GbiFRG5eaa	Without appearing "sceptical"or "egotistical" here is my view as one who worked in a major UK hospital for seven years.<br>  Social healthcare is a great concept, as stated it is not free, we are taxed at source on income to support the service. Only those who do not work are exempt.<br>  We now live in what is known as as a "postcode" lottery aka in the US a "zip" code.<br>  The level of care available and the standard you achieve is determined by where you live.<br>  The reasons for this? Our social healthcare (NHS) has been continuously sold off behind closed doors to private companies..<br>  They now build all new facilities with the proviso that "they" will provide the cleaners, the porters, the catering, the sterile (so called) instruments, the admin etc, to their specifications. The NHS has their hands tied in contract profit making.<br>  Add to this that we have a political duty to treat the rest of our European neighbours "free gratis" and a "duty of care" to treat the world and his uncle, and you just might get an idea of why our health services are at breaking point. <br>  BTW, were I, as a "euro" to need medical treatment in a fellow member state, I would have to jump through hoops to get it, but not here lol.  <br>  More and more cash is pumped in yet delivery deteriorates.<br>  Our GPs have nearly all switched to "premium" telephone numbers which cost a fortune before you even speak to a human being, TVs in every surgery espousing rubbish that no one looks at yet pays for. <br>  In my surgery you can wait for an appointment in a weeks time if you are lucky, <br>  So called "drop in" centres are funded by business not those with an interest in healthcare, set up purely to meet government "targets". <br>  Top managers are paid a fortune to " teach" those who are trained how to do the job whilst having nothing more than a qualification in management! <br>  All the ancillary work is done by immigrants who are "bussed" in on a daily basis, most do not speak English and have the rudiments of hygiene explained to them, but hey they work for peanuts. <br>  Visit any A & E (emergency) dept and you will see more interpreters than you will Drs, I kid you not, I worked in one lol.<br>  My local newspaper ran a headline only today, "Woman dies as she waits two weeks for broken hip op" <br>  We Brits used to have a saying, "What America does today, we shall be doing in ten years".<br>  Today I say, what Britain has f****d up  America should not follow, BEWARE, we had the greatest pride in our,"universal and free for all at the point of need" NHS, successive government intervention has sold us off whilst still screwing our taxes, and "free for all" has become just that.<br>  Unless of course you are an indigenous taxpayer.<br>  My view is not racist or xenophobic, simply one of wisdom and experience.<br>  When a government can dictate/decide who takes precedence, be afraid unless you have private healthcare to save you from their lunacy.|`|OIDejLJXaa	The NHS in the UK is far from perfect, but has much to recommend it. <br>  <br>  You choose your own GP (General Practitioner) who would normally be your first point of contact. When you require an appointment, you would normally be seen within 48 hours.<br>  <br>  In most towns there is some sort of 'drop-in' minor injuries clinic - here you would generally see a nurse who can treat, call a doctor (you settle for whoever is on duty), refer you to a larger hospital and if necessary arrange transport. You are likely to have to wait a up to a couple of hours in these clinics.<br>  <br>  In major hospitals there are accident and emergency units. Few people live more than 30 minutes drive from one of these. Here you will be treated by real doctors, with up to date equipment, without charge, but can expect to wait about 4 hours if you aren't at death's door. If there is a need to admit you to hospital, you might wait several more hours for a bed.<br>  <br>  Life threatening work is generally done quickly and skilfully. There are many complaints about waiting lists for non-emergency work, which will routinely be over a year, depending on the type of treatment needed.<br>  <br>  We have a private medical system. It is no better clinically than the NHS. It has superior food and comfort facilities, and if you decide to pay, there are no waiting lists. The private sector does no accident and emergency work - people routinely are 'patched up' by the NHS after accidents, and move to their private scheme to recuperate.<br>  <br>  We have to pay for it in taxes. Income tax of 20% on all you earn from about ￡7000 - ￡35000, then 40% on everything above that. In addition, there is 'National Insurance' - which is typically about another 5% of income. And then there's VAT (sales tax) of 15% on many goods.<br>  <br>  It's a balancing act - no one is denied any treatment because they can't pay, and the poorest have the same access to modern diagnostic techniques and treatments as the very rich (although standards vary across the country). But it's very expensive and labour intensive. And you may have choice of GP, and to some extent choice of which hospital you are subsequently treated at - but you don't have any choice of hospital consultant treating you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to live under any other system, but then again, I know no other. I could afford private medical insurance, but feel that the NHS provides for my healthcare more than adequately.<br>  <br>  If I had to pay more, I'd probably expect and receive a better service - but probably not clinically better, just more comfort, better food and less waiting.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Taxation is socialised money distribution.The police.firemen,are a socialised form of welfare,so why some americans have a problem with socialised healthcare is beyond me.<br>  <br>  If the fire brigade turn up at a fire,they put the fire out regardless.They do not charge per fire,type and size of fire or duration<br>  <br>  If the police turn up at scene of crime,they do not charge a large fee for a murder investigation and a small fee for a robbery,they just investigate.<br>  <br>  Yet in healthcare you are charged more if you use one/two or three pillows etc etc|`|5gKg5S0vaa	Yes your country needs a national health service desperately.  People being crippled by hospital bills because they don't qualify for medical insurance doesn't exist, everyone has the right to receive medical treatment in my country no matter what their circumstances are.  Our health care system is far from perfect but it is so much more advanced than yours.  It is astounding how Americans have been duped into thinking that a national health service is so much worst than the system they have now - seriously how much worst could it get!!  It's astonishing what the medical insurance companies get away with.  It's about time American citizens educated themselves on the benefits of a NHS and realised that the horrors mentioned above are lies created by despicable insurance companies who put profit before patients.<br>  <br>  Willow I would research American health care before warning them off an NHS.  The NHS isn't perfect as stated but it's better than whats provided in the the US at the moment.  The health insurance companies are not like we have in the U.K.  Here private health insurance guarantee's 1st rate attention and care but in the U.S because there is no alternative provided the companies turn down applicants with minor ailments aand those that are fortunate enough to be granted insurance will usually have to fight for treatment because the companies would rather let patients die and turn a bigger profit than have to pay for life saving treatment.  It is shocking.  As I said I would research a bit more and maybe you will appreciate our NHS even with the imperfections you have mentioned.|`|98fdbd5cd1b814cad2a0336c5272ae4faa	I can tell you about France:<br>  The government does not ‘assign’ a doctor or meddle in diagnosis or treatment, right?<br>   - right they do not. You pick your doctor, and it is not restricted.There is a dr-patient relationship, the gov does not interfere or advise dr's on treatments to use for their patients. Drs there are also not pushing the latest (sometimes untested or dangerous ex Vioxx) pharmaceutical creations like they do here. They seem to care more about getting to the cause of the problem as opposed to here in the US where they seem to treat (band aid) the symptoms - unless it is something obvious like a broken bone.<br>  <br>  You don’t lie on a gurney for two weeks waiting for emergency heart surgery, right?<br>  -no! not in France anyway. I have heard this from friends/coworkers from the UK though.<br>  <br>  You have actual hospitals with people in white lab coats, sophisticated modern equipment, electricity and running water indoors, right?<br>  -Yes! And some of the best doctors in the world.|`|J1I8sSkpaa	It works perfectly (you can choose a private hospital instead would you like so but even high income families like mine (parents are lawyers) use the public ones since well you basically just trust them).<br>  <br>  It really just comes down to if your willing to give up a larger part of your income to help other people or not (we pay alot more in taxes than in the U.S) however I don't have an issue with this as I simply consider things like healthcare and education (also free) to be something everyone has the right to regardless of income.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  It really just boils down to if you can trust the government with your money or not, we've had it like this since well forever and I really can't see how the government in any way limits me but can think of a lot of ways they do help, americans seem to view it diffrently.<br>  <br>  We're both democracies though so it's really comes down to how people want it to be, I prefer it this way other countries might prefer it another way and then they should go with that.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	I personally think we should have nationalized health care and base it off the UK model. Over there, the doctors make good money, the sick people get treated and patients don't die. i think we need to abbolish all HMO'S and healthcare companies and let us choose what doctor we want to see without referals and such. I know all you bastards that make a ton of money will disagree with my thoughts and I am ok with that. But I know our society will be much better off without Blue cross and blue shield playing the executioner, becuase they don't want to pay for a surgery that will save a persons life! Shame on them!|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	you shouldn't blanket all americans into one lump...I personally have long admired what Canada and Germany has done with health care. <br>  I am very fortunate to have had good insurance my whole life; first my dad was in the service and now I've had a jobs with excellent benefits since ..geez, 83. I had a stint of about 6 months where I was contracting and had no benefits.<br>  <br>  But , one thing that I have observed and that I believe strongly. Good medical and dental care should NOT be a privilege. It's something , in my opinion, every American (being American) deserves. Any every person in the world deserves, too. Obviously those are 2 different issues. <br>  <br>  I personally think, here is America, with as far as things have gone (insurance conglomorates,etc) that we will need to phase this in. Preventative care , vaccines, exams, birth control, preventative dental care is a very good start. And it will save money in the long run. Again, that's just a start.<br>  <br>  Besides, we need to throw away the box. You get great ideas of pros and cons from countries that have this. And then you apply some innovation and maybe come up with something different...that wouldn't be possible without the base experience of how it's implemented elsewhere today.|`|aIakDSstaa	Socialised health care has many problems I'll agree but to be honest being safe in the knowledge that if Im sick no matter what my circumstances of employment or finance happen to be I will receive treatment is priceless.<br>  <br>  Ive never been out of work, never required health insurance and always paid my taxes. But you never now right?? Its a safety net that Im glad of.

He is a natural American citizen.

In other words, President Obama knows the law.  He would not have run for president if he wasn't an American citizen. <br>  <br>  President Obama has no respect or sympathy for terrorists.

He want's change in the Environment, global warming isn't a government conspiracy, it's happening right now, you can prove it. He want's everyone to be able to have the same opportunities to have a great education. in the past, i dont think we've ever had a president that actually wanted to HELP the United States because they were scared of what the citizens would say, there are some people who judge badly even on Great decisions. Barack is wanting to stop the war, and not look like an idiot.<br>  <br>  Honestly, i wish people would just stop judging him because he's black. Race doesn't make a difference, His ideas do, what he wants for us matters and how we go about treating him will affect all of that.<br>  He's going to be great, give him a chance... you'll see. he's not going to make the United States look stupid, and he's deffinitely on a better page with rulers of other countries, and that's great for us. but like i said, CHANGE we need is here, give him a chance.|`|f4K08k0Raa	there is no other reason then that hes black...i dont see him fixing this mess like he promised he is only making it worse<br>  <br>  or maybe his plans all along were to make it better for only certain people?|`|s5C861QLaa	he won the election cuz hes black!!!!!!!!!!!

Americans aren't allowed to discuss the fact this country can't support an infinite of people.

When you say Democrats "emphasize" something, it is merely a cover word for "they seek entitlements". As for thinking the family should promote values, wrong again. There is a bill floating around there Dem sponsored that seeks to take most parental decisions from the parents by way of regulation of how they raise them. Also, many Dems favor public boarding schools from an early age on. Not all Dems ascribe to all of this, but unfortunately, A LOT of them in Congress do feel this way--and they are the ones shaping our future right now.<br>  <br>  On Republicans...the minute you started plugging in the "villian" phrases, I quit reading. Your bias is a little on the glaring side. Maybe you should relabel them as "Saints" and "Sinners" as that appears to be your portrayal. They do NOT believe the government should decide things for you. Most of us are not rich, we just believe that it is counterproductive and a losing bet to confiscate one person's money to hand to another who will never work for it as long as they have someone handing it to them. Redistribution of wealth is an economy murderer. If you doubt that, go back to FDR and especially Carter. Wonder why companies move off shore? Regulating and taxing the hell out of them benefits NO ONE. The cost is always passed on to the employee (less hours, benefits, pay) and the consumer (higher prices). Class warfare is NOT the way to go...as eventually you run out of "combatants" to pilfer from. Then where do you get the money? Next tier down. Repeat cycle, rinse and go to the next bracket down until we are equally poor.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	The sad truth is that both parties are extremely close in their views, but Americans are taught that the differences are vast.<br>  Some idiots think republicans stand for unfettered free market capitalism, but that is completely untrue. if any nation is practicing unfettered free market economies it's China in certain economies of scale by the way they use dissenters to harvest their organs to sell on their own free markets. In fact, much of their military is funded and paid for that way, but few will ever admit to that.<br>  We have a system that attempt to fool us into believing we hate each other which is also untrue because the vast majority get along just fine and it's only petty matters that separate us.<br>  Republicans love to preach the talking snake nonsense while Democrats are more along the lines of a secular bunch.<br>  If Republicans don't have an answer then it's: let's ask the talking snake or the flying spaghetti monster for divine providence.<br>  Democrats usually see it as: Well, we might believe in the talking snake somewhat or the spaghetti monster, but since there isn't really one here now we have to decide on our own.<br>  Republicans want all geological events to happen tomorrow or it doesn't really exist while democrats realize geological matters happen over eons and not the next afternoon.<br>  Just like global warming...It got cold this winter therefore it doesn't exist. But we know that global warming IS happening, but it's not going to all show up as fire falling out of the sky tomorrow.<br>  California hasn't dropped into the pacific ocean yet so there really isn't a fault there at all, just to much traffic. But in reality the faults DO exist, but geology doesn't happen in a day.

Democrats favor a government that supports no income families through higher taxes for everyone. They strongly support government entitlement programs such as social security and healthcare. In social matters, Democrats value those who don't want to live off of others hard work or wish to take that which is not theirs, and they also feel that people should not have to learn their lessons and should be bailed out of their bad decisions (this is usually labeled as socially liberal).<br>  <br>  Republicans - a short summary<br>  Republicans generally support government policies that benefit everyone and less government influence over the individual. Republicans favor a government that supports America by reducing corporate, investment and income taxes. Republicans believe that reducing corporate taxes and regulations will translate into lower unemployment rates, that reduced investment taxes will translate into economic growth, and that reduced income taxes will create consumer prosperity. They would prefer not to have government entitlement programs such as social security and nationalized healthcare because they reward laziness and irresponsibility. In social matters, Republicans believe that the government should make certain moral decisions for us because we are incapable of making them ourselves and believe that if you violate the rights of someone else you forfeit your own. They believe that the government should reward hard work and responsibility and not laziness and bad decision making. (this is usually labeled as socially conservative).|`|hSZDVKF3aa	Are you on crack?    The dems never believe in personal responsibility, that's why there's welfare and abortion.

I just heard a military man say he expects a riot this summer over the policies set down now. He went on to say he wanted to get orders to fight in the middle east. He said he would feel safer.<br>  <br>  It is too bad this country can not be unified. We have become our own worse enemy.|`|6EB2JDFmaa	No, but it is more unamerican to put forth bills that will intentionally make all citizens dependent on the government. It is patriotic to defend what is left of our freedoms before that time is too late.|`|XuLVfj1caa	I think a better question is this:  What does it mean to us all if the President succeeds.  I mean what is it that he is working to do?  He's hoping to stem the recession, repair the banks, repair our international image and standing, clean up banking policy, solve the crisis at our borders, close the gap on our trade deficit, ensure that the Auto Companies don't go out of business, fix Iraq and Afghanistan, and get Osama Bin Laden, plus fix the healthcare system and build a domestic energy policy that decreases our dependence on oil.  <br>  <br>  So, is there really anyone out there that wants him to fail at any of this stuff?  I don't and if John McCain had been elected I wouldn't want him to fail either.  The problems effect us all.  What we're squabbling about is the process of how these problems get solved...not whether or not the actual problems need to be solved.|`|hSZDVKF3aa	Not at all.... We want to educate him before  it's too late.   All the dems said Bush lied about things. HOW can they even have a straight face now that Obama doesn't even know what an earmark is.... This is only after a month, and already the lies and deceit.|`|Ga3lCQTNaa	We do not want Obama to fail per say., WE just want him to go away,<br>  Quietly without ruining the country completely. His policies and programs<br>  show ultra left toward Socialistic behavior, No good for a republic,|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	Only about as much as Democrats wanted Bush to fail.<br>    :-p|`|B1VxBl2paa	No, I just want him to die a violent death at the hands of one of his own voters.|`|AA11117089	oh, but it was fine for everybody do dish on bush??  double-standard %$&^$!|`|bZy74U06aa	We want his National Socialist agenda to fail.|`|Spixxn8Gaa	I do.<br>  <br>  Do you REALLY want liberal socialism in America?|`|H9zCmv81aa	I am a Republican and a proud American.  Yes i want Obama too fail. If he fails, his policies fail... and his policies are bad for this country. I love my country and I want what is best for it, his policies are not best for the country I love. Don't give me this "lay off the guy" passive attitutude.  He is proposing and pushing legislation that will rob myself, my children and my grandchildren, as well as yours, of their rights. I will not sit idly by and "give the poor guy a chance" to step on myself or my family.|`|LWtz8cGsaa	We want America to sauced,  but with Barq Obama in charge it won't happened.|`|Fa2X600iaa	yes|`|peEHzKGDaa	Yes, and in the process they are rooting for America to fail.  And they claim to love their country!?|`|L592wjsjaa	Not Henrietta. My man Barack givin me a free house.|`|qTCo9QW2aa	His stimulus plan is full of wasteful spending and he lied about it in his speech...so...no I don't trust him.

Nothing but get a lot of Americans of all ethnicities KILLED in a war WITHOUT meaning.  The reason I don't trust any Caucasians now is because at least 99% of them are RACIST (esp. these uneducated rednecks where I reside), and I'd say 95% of whites in America probably wish Hilary Clinton or even Joe Biden had run for Prez. <br>  <br>  None of you like having a Black man in that White House, is the prob.<br>  <br>  Screw Rush Limbaugh, why doesn't he lose weight or just croak?!?|`|U2bJVUfzaa	from the asker: "lot people don't even know what the stimulus bill is and hate it. Because Obamas a democrat. I mean come on lay off the poor guy. That is unamerican to continually hate the president."<br>  <br>  First, Thomas Jefferson said 'Dissent is the greatest form of patriotism.'<br>  <br>  It is absolutely not "unamerican" to question the president or any government official.  In fact, is your and my patriotic duties to constantly question the president and congress, and to push for policies that Just and in accord with the Constitution.  You will hear from the President and Congress that Republicans are playing "politics as usual", and you will hear it from Republicans about Democrats.  They say this because people will not bend on their principles and buckle to what the Democrats want to do, and vice versa.  When a bill is absolutely against your fundamental belief system but you sign on to it anyway, THAT is unAmerican.  <br>  <br>  <br>  No, we do not want America to fail.  We want Obama's policies to not happen, because we believe that Federal Government is already too big, already reaches past its bounds.  We believe that the rich shouldn't be penalized for being wealthy.  We believe that the poor is absolutely equal to the rich and they should all be treated exactly the same.  We believe that people have the right to own private property, and that people should have the right to the pursuit of happiness.  We believe that it is the American spirit to want to help those who need help, but we believe it is wrong to have the Government mandate that help.  Americans help the most when they are not forced to do so.  We also believe that the Government is neither efficient or knows how to run a business, case in point is that the Senate Cafe went bankrupt only after Congress took over management.<br>  <br>   You heard talk of Socialism in the campaign, and it was played down.  Now, you see that the Fed has majority ownership in Citibank and others, 100's of billions of dollars have been appropriated for National Health care Coverage, agencies are being created to force electronic medical records and to oversee the treatments of patients.  I must not fully understand the definition of Socialism, because all of this happened in 3-4 months, I am truly scared about the future of our country.<br>  <br>  The rhetoric you hear is not hate.  It is the loud and concerned cries of dissent because we believe that we are heading down a path of doom and destruction, and the steps our Government is taking to get us out is only digging us deeper into the hole, and the markets obviously agree with us.  Instead of giving us a helping hand up, we are getting shoved down into that hole.  The intentions are all good, but the means do not lead us to the end that we need.|`|JWDfOTX2aa	Most republicans want Obama to fail because a lot of black people like him just because he has some black in him. They want to prove to America that color isn't everything.|`|d7570355e6c141f9b4bc359d2fb03aa1aa	Republicans depend on trust, no one even knows who Obama is. <br>  <br>  We could've grabbed the next Mexican to cross the line and made him El Presidenta, it wouldn't have been any different.|`|a4XA69uGaa	Of course they want Obama to fail because they would rather be right than righteous.|`|MgMsMExPaa	The Republicans are sore losers.|`|bXl12I4Baa	yes all Republicans love to see Obama fol. but this will not happened|`|AA12316366	i don't think they want him to fail in the sense that it would harm the people or country but, all political parties want to be in power. i don't think anyone is stupid enough to  want  the country go down the tubes.<br>  <br>  oldmarin, you sure did your homework. iwish  i had your patience. thanks for the education. i learned much.
fSlZQzS4aa	Make sure that the previous wife is properly divorced under local law for where she is.  If not, your fiance will be guilty of bigamy even if it is not intentional and it will cause problems at the worst possible time.  If he doesn't know or can't locate her, he should consult a divorce attorney where he is and take care of it himself.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Bwarney Fwranks should be in prison -  corrupt congress members like Barney Frank, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, pressured banks to make more loans to minorities and borrowers with weak credit histories and were relentless. Congress passed Bill Clintons Community Reinvestment Act, empowering regulators to punish banks that failed to "meet the credit needs" of "low-income, minority, and distressed neighborhoods." Lenders responded by loosening their underwriting standards and making increasingly shoddy loans. The two government-chartered mortgage finance firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, encouraged this "subprime" lending by authorizing ever more "flexible" criteria by which high-risk borrowers could be qualified for home loans, and then buying up the questionable mortgages that ensued.<br>  All this was justified as a means of increasing homeownership among minorities and the poor. Affirmative-action policies trumped sound business practices. A manual issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston advised mortgage lenders to disregard financial common sense. "Lack of credit history should not be seen as a negative factor," the Fed's guidelines instructed. Lenders were directed to accept welfare payments and unemployment benefits as "valid income sources" to qualify for a mortgage. Failure to comply could mean a lawsuit.<br>  <br>  Barney’s Frank has his fingerprints are all over this fiasco. Time and time again, Frank insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in good shape. Frank was adamant that "these two entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not facing any kind of financial crisis." When the White House warned of "systemic risk for our financial system" unless the mortgage giants were curbed, Frank complained that the administration was more concerned about financial safety than about housing. <br>  <br>  Now that the bubble has burst and the "systemic risk" is apparent to all, Frank blithely declares: "The private sector got us into this mess." Well, give the congressman points for gall. Wall Street and private lenders have plenty to answer for, but it was Washington and the political class that derailed this train.<br>  <br>  Lets drag him through the streets like you said - I'll bring the rope!!|`|CNSGz12zaa	I believe you have him confused with the Republicans...they deny they made the mess, they wont help to fix it and their solution is to do nothing...just like NERO.|`|37Q4QMF1aa	I would think that Bobby Jindal is more like Nero.|`|EbsekS7yaa	THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH FREDDIE MAC!!!|`|otncH1phaa	You probably wouldnt be able to ask this type of question if a Nero type person was in power.

M3maZgdyaa	I have and will again. BUT not in this way. The way we are doing it we CAN'T pay it off.<br>  <br>  When you go into debt to get out of debt, you do this with a debt that PAYS something. The debt that America is getting into is to large for us. Our grandchildren will inherit this debt. <br>  <br>  We haven't stopped yet. They are adding more astronomical sums every day! If we in debt our selves to this extent this month what about every year from now on? <br>  <br>  Do you think this will sustain us for years? No they will be back every year for the National Budget and every other project that they can think of. This will drive the debt up to sums that are past astounding.<br>  <br>  Do you know who REALLY pays this?<br>  <br>  Look at your paycheck. At the boxes that says Federal Tax, State Tax. Even Social Security. (this to will go up).This amount will double with our tax hike. The amount you are paid will be reduced.<br>  <br>  Our tax hike will be within this year. BO said "he" wants to cut the debt by 1/2. We get to pay it. The rich will pay some but we will pay more.<br>  <br>  This is where the Government gets their money. From OUR paychecks. All the debt the Government owes is ours. We The People are the Government.<br>  <br>   We will be Nationalized. They will make all pay equal at the new min. wage. Enjoy your new prosperity.|`|m5J36D28aa	I see you skipped your economics classes.|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	I once saw an advertisement that said<br>  <br>  "Now you can borrow enough to be completely out of debt"<br>  <br>  May I also quote a poem from the recently deceased British poet - Adrian Mitchell<br>  <br>  "There are Fascists<br>  Pretending to be Humanitarians<br>  Like cannibals on a health-kick<br>  Eating only vegetarians"<br>  <br>  It is the same, blinkered thinking. and our Governments are doing it.|`|oTAPazvcaa	That would be the government of The United States of America. (The only change I see is in my pocket.... for now).<br>  The best way to get out of debt is to cut back you spending (eating out going to movies ect..) and spend more on paying off the debt. People can make it with no debt, my wife and I don't have or want a credit card, the only debt we have is our house. Banks will lend without a high FICO score,they call it manual underwriting.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	when Clinton left office the budget would have been balanced in 2010, that was until GW came along and had to go pick a fight with some poor people in mud huts in distant countries. Nearly all of our debt in the last 8 years is a direct result of being at war. Remember in Econ the whole butter and guns Speech?|`|f36a70ysaa	Playing by the rules is not paying off it seems. It will be only pride that keeps people working and paying their own way from now on, the rest will take without regret.|`|I9rRDZpbaa	I agree.  You don't have a basic understanding of economics.  Ever heard the phrase "you have to spend money to make money"?  <br>  <br>  I suppose you'd rather just let everything fail.  The problem is that the warning signs were IGNORED and now the possible solutions are going to be VERY painful.  It's time the young generations learn two important lessions:  1. life is not fair (we will also have to bail out folks that don't deserve it), and 2. you can't cry to mommy and daddy to fix this problem, you're on your own.|`|sZ0McynSaa	That's the American way: If you are in debt—spend, spend, spend your way out and make the next generations and wealthy pay for it.|`|BwrGcTosaa	Not I, I cut up my credit cards years ago and have never regretted doing so.  <br>  <br>  Too bad we can't get that message across to "our elected representatives."
45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	Wow, Isaac, I am frankly stunned by the comments you have gotten on this.  Thank you for posting the link to the video, I thought it was beautiful.<br>  <br>  It is a matter of timing here on Y/A and apparently this is the time of day when most Liberals are working.  As a white woman, nearly 60, who worked for civil rights in the 60's,  I am deeply ashamed that color is still even an issue.  Obviously it is.<br>  <br>  Someone here yesterday asked about God creating humans to be equals.  There is nothing about color, eye shape, hair, etc. in the bible and supposedly those people who believe in God should take that as their lesson book.  They do not, and religion continues to be the divider, it is all such a bunch of BS. According to the Bible we are all descendants of Adam & Eve, there is nobody else in that mix, so we are all related. If we were all blind, what would we base our prejudices on then?|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	That's a beautiful video; thanks for sharing it.

GJJw2wszaa	Mostly republicans, what can you expect from them? They are like rabbit dogs.|`|AA10287176	Ignorance and stupidity usually goes hand in hand with cruelty. Most people have very strong feelings about politics, but at the same time very few people know enough to have intelligent opinions about political, economic, or social issues. <br>  <br>  When you combine a lack of education with strong feelings, you get something much like the political sections of yahoo answers, or, for that matter, like America during an election season. There is a reason why politicians have to dumb down their rhetoric and campaign with what is little more than childish name-calling.|`|4uike3ARaa	If you go to a room where questions are asked that have concrete answers, such as Home and Garden and others like it, the questions and the answers are much more civil.<br>  Coming to a room where everyone has strong opinions, it is not surprising that some - okay, many - people resort to juvenile and bullying behavior rather than make any attempt at civil discourse.<br>  Not surprising, but still saddening.<br>  I can disagree with someone without resorting to insulting them or what they believe in.<br>  Most of the time, anyway.|`|7EkeIcw4aa	Do you remember George Bush?

It's one of those things many people take very very personally (like religion), and are easily offended by if others don't agree with them. So when Yahoo gives this entire section to debating and talking politics, there's bound to be a lot of anger, clashing, and discord.<br>  <br>  Whatever. They could just be mean because they were drunk lol. :)|`|nfLd3ngraa	People are party bias. It goes both ways. However i do see republicans do it more often. Basically america is an ignornat society. Everyones different and everybody thinks they're right. American has a very high homcidal rate alot bigger than most other countries in the world. And its not the violent videogames of the violent movies. People just can't get along so they shoot each other. Think about it.

AA10709853	no.|`|m5J36D28aa	Being in the military doesn't give you special rights for your private firearms.|`|xXt7Rw74aa	No, HOWEVER, one does not need to be 21 to "own" a handgun in any state that im aware of. Even california that i live in. You simply can not be sold a hand gun my a FFL (liscensed gun shop). I believe in most states you can buy a hand gun from a normal person and just do a transfer (which probably cost 20-100 bucks depending on state fees and paperwork costs). Or if your states play real hardball like in california you can have the gun transfered to you ONLY by your mom/dad grandma/grandpa. So they purchase it for you, then transfer it....<br>  <br>  A very good site for information regarding this kind of stuff is calguns.net<br>  They have everything you need to know from swindling handgun laws to building a ar15 in an assault weapon banned state. Theres ways to do everything, you just gotta research harder than the average joe to find it :)|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Bill's right.  Getting in the military will connect you with lots of people who are very excited about guns who will be extremely happy to buy a gun and then sell it to you at 18.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	keith is right. you cant buy a handgun in most states if you are under 21. military doesnt override the law|`|BRyRtQSvaa	no|`|8ygYvN1Caa	No When My Uncle who's 25 now was in the navy he was not allowed to buy a hand gun he was allowed to use one if given as equipment

Again, if you were a Palin supporter, she actively participates in a socialistic profit sharing program in her state.  <br>  <br>  If you haven't figured out the stock market yet you're still, not paying attention.  The traders there only care about themselves.  They don't care about long term issues, they don't care about tomorrow, they care about today.  The market is adjusting because they are not hearing that more bank bailouts are coming free of strings.  In other words, with the last bailout, the banks were given money and not told or even asked how they should or would or could spend it.  So, they paid bonuses, bought sponsorships on stadiums, and took executive trips using some of that money (in some cases.)  <br>  <br>  The new administration isn't going to put up with that kind of behavior and that frightens the banks.  The banks are in trouble, and the only institution that can save them from bankruptcy (which I think they should probably be forced to) is the government.  But the government wants to control how their money is spent...that is the current drag on the market....along with the profit declines for the Big 3 announced this week, and the continuing losses by other market indicators, here and abroad.  There is no one thing that affects the market, least of all, comments by any president.|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	Don't talk about socialism. It's apparently a concept you don't understand.<br>  <br>  Investors simply understand times are changing and making money will not be as easy as before. Don't forget, they are the main reason for our collapse. They work with only one goal ... making money as fast as possible. Of course, with Obama's new policies, they see it as a threat.<br>  <br>  They never see the big picture. They don't understand that with the way it is today, they will fail anyway.

WvAlIncZaa	I'm not 100% sure on weather it's "legal" or not, but then again, taht would be up to the classifier.  If he/she doesn't want your parents in their office then that's their choice.  Then again, they actually have nothing to hide so I don't see why they won't allow them.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you recruiter explained to you how the whole process at MEPS works.  But there's nothing that you or your parents can do or say, or as you put it, pick up and find things you may overlook.  Everything is computerized and everything is by regulation.  If you don't meet the cut for something then you just don't.  There are certain jobs that pin point certain parts of your ASVAB, not just the overall score.  A lot of people complain about that but that's just how it is.  If you did poorly on mechanics and math but aced everything else and your score is high, you might still not get that Nuke, etc.<br>  <br>  The classifier will ask you what you want, let you look through the book then punch everything in the computer and tell you what's available.  If it's not there, they can't make it up for you and assign you a rate.  It must be available and you must qualify.  Classifiers are NOT like recruiters.  They are very matter of fact and get to the point pretty quick because they don't have the i need you attitude like recruiters.  If you dont like whats available, they send you away.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	You go to MEPS alone.  <br>  Talk to your recruiter more and ask more questions in this forum to get answers to make better decisions.<br>  You're trying to join the military, you have to cut the apron stings from the parents.|`|AA10709853	no.   only recruits are allowed  to sit down with the Classifier.  your parents will not be pemritted to accompany you while you are getting everything done at MEPS.  in fact they discourage them even going as they will be spending all day waiting outside.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	When I used to write contracts at MEPS we occasionally had parents who wanted to sit in and be involved.  Just know when you and your parents leave the room, everyone is going to be making fun of you.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	you make "signing away 5-6 years of your life" sound like a bad thing. if you view it by signing away your life maye you shouldnt join. you dont sound very confident|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	It needs to be arranged in advance and can be done. I did it several times while I was on Recruiting duty. I took the parents down to the cafeteria and hung out with them there until it was near time for the applicant to go into classification. I was usualy only one parent , but 2 is doable. Your recruiter is being lazy and doesn't want the extra hassle of bringing your parents. Just keep in mind that the classifcation session is designed to last 20 minutes or so and there will be others waiting. If you need more time to figure out your job choice they will have you wait in the hallway or cafeteria. They are only going to dig so far. The top six or so jobs the navy needs, not everthing in the book. So keep that in mind and that's the main reason recruiters try to discurage parents comming to meps.|`|tz2qxNPYaa	If you need your parents with you to make a decision... you probably shouldn't be joining the military. You are obviously of age to join, so the answer is no... they aren't allowed to hold your hand.

Jwk7Ib2vaa	As much as I want to shoot every person who criticizes America, I feel that you are mildly correct. For the average person, they have about $800 in credit card debt alone, they have their lives to worry about, their kids future to consider as well as the daily grinds of living a life. We (as citizens) want to help this great country of ours in any possible way, but we do have to worry about self preservation first. Survival of the fitest isn't just something conservatives and evangelists can brush off of their shoulders, it's real and every living breathing thing does it. We work as hard as we can to get the most out of life during our short time here; in that process, we fck up a little, it's a give in. We buy things we shouldn't buy & eat things we shouldn't eat, but it's our own personal decision, is it not?<br>  I have to nod my head to you, you have hit the proverbial nail on the head. Where do governmental protection and personal responsibility intertwine? Should we be held, as private citizens, to the same standard and scrutiny as the elected officials making decisions for us?<br>  I think so. <br>  Consumers who can't stop consuming really are a terrible thing, they consume not only goods, but any services that seem beneficial at the time. Loans, credit cards, equity lines; these things are luxeries yet the average person goes through each as if it will magically pay itself off one day.<br>  10 years ago, actions like these were semi-excusable, these days, I think people need to check their morals and priorities before they write another check at all.|`|0LlRUBWlaa	there will always be debt, taxes never end, even if everything you own is paid off. government has spent so much money on frivolous and ignorant research, other countries who hate us, exorbiant parties, black budgets, and anyway  they can  to keep their hands in your pockets -and that goes for the state too.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Most people seem to be serious about paying down debt - their own as well as the country's.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	No. -And for the SAME Reason why so many of Us find it Hard to pay down our own Credit Cards...-It's Somebody "Else's" money, -so why should We worry about it !!! :o|`|HCrDeJycaa	not if you are in congress or on the presidents staff or work 4 the feds.|`|otncH1phaa	Really, whats the difference? It would be nice if it was paid off, but do you think its going to happen?|`|AA11313983	A very small percentage of us do.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Yes, I do believe you are right. When I was younger I saved for a house bought it paid it off, etc. I got to a point where I saw that it didn't really matter how hard I worked. I saw sports stars & Paris Hilton & horrible people like the McCains who could just get someone to write the story of their life instead of them having to tell the truth. It is discouraging for most people. The Obama's are very inspiring & so are many other people who have had rags to richs stories like Oprah. ...I have one son that died & my other one doesn't even care if he gets my house when I die so the motivation I had is gone. So I needed to destress & stopped caring about living on a budget. The country is such a mirror for me. I do now have faith though that we are going to prosper. While I have been doing whatever I want I have read many books & have learned that prosperity is not what most people think it is. Obama is doing what the people who came from rags & went to richs have done so he really is on track.

You need to quit living in the past there DUDE!|`|WTHTVJN6aa	No, Mayor Ray Nagen and former Governor Kathleen Blanco were asleep at the wheel.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Bush and McCain were Anti Americans that destroyed this country.  Obama is trying to save this country and the conservative born again deficit haters are saying "hold it".  They don't realize that money has to be spent in order to correct their mistakes.  Jindal approved hurricane help because he is on the Gulf Coast, but disapproves help in volcano detection.  Typical conservative hypocrytical illogic.  There is also an idiot out there who is a stock market illiterate that claims Obama is the cause of the Dow going down.

Other than that it goes through the channels which handles these things and Louisiana just didn't get their part done right.A tragedy all around.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	The Federal Government can not just step into a local situation like that, there is protocol. Mayor Nagin was delinquent in asking the then Governor for state aide and the Governor was delinquent in requesting Federal government assistance for almost 10 days after that fact.

The helicopter could hardly navigate, and I saw some national guard guys trying to navigate a boat in that wind and they just could not humanly make it happen, So what would you expect could have taken place to rescue people. that hurricane was a natural disaster, and the one who didn't leave, shame on them, no one to blame but themselves!! sorry, but if we had a storm like that I would leave!!! and get to higher grounds, its the common sense thing to do, so now these people will blame the USA for them not listening!! doesn't make much sense at all!!!!|`|9q3PSPIgaa	Why is it that all liberals put the tragedy in New Orleans on Bush's doorstep?  Now McCain as well?<br>  <br>  What was Obama doing?  What was Hillary doing?

RkfIPD7Iaa	The government cannot just randomly lower mortgages, that is a private sector function.  The mortgages are owned by banks and lending institutions, forcing them to lower the value of the mortgages would be considered unconstitutional seizure of assets.<br>  <br>  The government can lower taxes, but taxes are what pay for all the goods and services the government provides.  Lowering them further at this point will drive the government deeper into debt.<br>  <br>  However, the government has not been 'raising' either mortgage rates or tax rates, both have in fact gone down greatly in the last couple of years.|`|j0k04HDxaa	Hi andrew,<br>  <br>  You'll have to be a bit careful with the answers you'll get on here as lets just say there are some more genuine than others!<br>  <br>  There's one online business that has been amazing for me and has helped me to start my own part-time business and earn some well needed extra cash.

Bankers have proven themselves to be utterly incompetent, but it is us geezers who will pay the price, in the short term through job losses and in the long term, through increased taxation.<br>  <br>  The hallowed halls of the banks should be sonorous with the sound of rolling heads.
pi5WKPNwaa	Look at it like this: Bush doubled the national debt in 8 years of being president. That was about $5,000,000,000.  By the end of Obama's 1st hundred days, he will have "almost" done the same, spending somewhere around $4,000,000,000.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Well, whatever the number is, it's waaayyyyy more than anyone else ever dreamed of spending (or planning to spend) in such a short time:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090226/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_budget">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090226/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  Obama refers to it as "a new era of responsibility"; that would be funny if I could stop crying.

SI8NXzNSaa	Do you think this is new?<br>  <br>  It's been this way since Gutenberg invented the printing press. In America the media has had a lot of control since day one...most of the anti/pro revolution writings were in the form of pamphlets to be handed out. Hearst in his day decided on presidents, and created the Spanish/American war just because he could.<br>  <br>  This isn't anything new, and it isn't going to be changing in the near future.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Nowhere in the first amendment is it written that lying is protected.  Nor is cherry picking, sophistry, or logical fallacy.  Until we decide that these things are not protected, you will continue to be lied to, given cherry picked facts, sophistry and fallacious logic.  And you will continue to see manufactured information from bribed authorities like doctors, engineers, scientists, government officials and even universities.  And you will be given these things deliberately to lead you and any other reasoning person to a set of predetermined conclusions.  This is done because of the most reasonable expectation that you will go on to speak, act  and vote according to those predetermined conclusions.<br>  <br>  Thirty five billion dollars was spent on feeding us this false information in America last year, (not including campaign money).  Another 35 billion dollars will be spent this year.  And the people who do it are no dummies.  They have over 100 years of research in their craft and they know precisely the statistical results of their craft.<br>  <br>  Democracy can only function properly when its participants vote according to their own best interests.  But feeding so much propaganda to so many participants results in a large number thinking, and acting upon conclusions that are not in their own best interests - but rather in the interests of those who can afford to disseminate such propaganda in such large quantities.  It is in this manner that the first amendment is being abused to preempt the very democratic process that underpins our entire society.<br>  <br>  For the sake of democracy, we must limit the freedom of expression.  We must ban the professional propagandist.<br>  <br>  Allow me to conclude this with the words of Edward Bernays - the very founder of this propaganda industry.  Written in his book "propaganda" back in 1928.<br>  <br>  "Those who manipulate the unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. In almost every act of our lives whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind."|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Ya think.  Reporters practically wet them selves over Obama.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	SORRY, but I don't agree with you. <br>  The "media" not reporting things as you believe them to be.. does not equate with the media lying. <br>  Just like Palin who whines that the media was "bashing her".. and is too freaking self centered to even grasp that SHE IS THAT DUMB, and that IS WHAT the majority of the nation saw. <br>  The media reporting Obama being popular.. is because it was factual. How simple is that?|`|9qKAy0dlaa	Are you sure it wasn't the pissed poor job the republicans did? <br>  <br>  <br>  That's ok blame the media in denial you are republican.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	They only have influence over those that blindly follow like sheep!|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	Well, I guess you have to ask yourself why you feel the media has too much influence.  I certainly don't take everything I see from TV and newspapers as the almighty truth, why do you assume that the rest of america does?  You may be better off trying to educate yourself on how to construct a sentence, instead of regurgitating some right wing garbage on how public schools, mainstream media, and everything else that you don't agree with is biased.

Many states even if you are a resident & earn money from another try to tax you on it.

By the way if you have an IRA or 401K from California they will extort taxes from you even if you no longer live in California.

Its all upto them.|`|ShTHhy3eaa	normally you should not deploy again due to your dwell time being low after your return. the policy is to "try" to give soldiers their 12 Months from deploying again. your worst scenario is to join this other unit and you get stop-lossed. you could stay on rear detachment until you've reached 12 months at "home" and deploy for the remainder of your unit's deployment. normally the army is trying to match soldiers after returning from deployment to a unit that's about to return so you can get the down time. makes no sense to take everybody that's returned from deployments in the last 3 months to send them to another post so they can deploy in 2 months. otherwise they would be going awfully shorthanded|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Duded you're in the Military haven't you got it yet?

Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|shtP63traa	There are a few different ways to look at it.<br>  <br>  * If you're religious, you could take the "thou shalt not kill" angle.  That's a pretty clear statement.<br>  <br>  * You could argue that even though the death penalty has been around for thousands of years, we still have murderers and rapists.  That could be proof that it doesn't deter anyone who is going to commit such crimes.<br>  <br>  * You could argue efficiency of the judicial system.  Because the penalty is irreversible, it takes many years to go through the full appeals process to make sure no one is unfairly executed.  For all of those years, the government is paying prosecutors, other lawyers, judges, court clerks, etc.  If you just put them in jail and eliminate or at least reduce the appeals process, then you'd save both time and money (and those prosecutors could work towards getting additional criminals off the streets instead of focusing on criminals already captured).<br>  <br>  * You could argue that it's just not necessary.  Life imprisonment keeps such criminals from hurting any more innocent people.  The fact that death is beyond what is necessary for protecting society, the death penalty could be construed as cruel and unusual punishment.|`|AvAkwdGKaa	Capital punishment, or the death penalty, was first used in the United States in colonial times. Since there were no prisons then, death was the punishment for a wide range of offenses. As the nation grew, laws regarding the administration of criminal justice were changed and refined and the death penalty was reserved for the most violent crimes. Public opinion about the death penalty has fluctuated over the years and there are concerns that innocent people have been executed or are waiting on death row. The death penalty began facing legal challenges in the 1960s, and was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court ruling in Furman v. Georgia in 1972 which held that it violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Four years later, the Court reversed its decision in Gregg v. Georgia. In recent years, the issue of capital punishment has again been taken up by the Supreme Court as justices consider the constitutionality of executing the mentally ill and juvenile offenders. In 2008, the Supreme Court mandated a national moratorium on executions while the court examined a lethal injection protocol used by 36 states. The European Union and the United Nations have backed international campaigns against capital punishment and more than half of all countries have abolished the death penalty. China, Iran, and the United States rank among the highest for the number of executions per year.<br>  <br>  Those who oppose capital punishment argue that it is as much a murder as the crime committed by the offender, that a life sentence is a greater punishment, that capital punishment does not deter crime, and that there is a risk that innocent people could be executed. The authors of 35 Years After Furman, Death Penalty Still Cruel, Unusual argue against the “disturbing use of capital punishment in America.” Resistance to Death Penalty Building Across U.S. acknowledges the growing “skepticism toward and resistance to the death penalty” after a number of wrongful convictions were uncovered in the late 1990s. The author of Time for a Moratorium Against the Death Penalty calls capital punishment “the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights” and supports a global moratorium on executions.

Currently the entry requirements are not available to the general public. At this time you'll need to talk to a recruiter to see what's required. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Well warhawk, I dont know where you are getting your info but you no longer need a source rate!! As I said before Special Operator (SO aka SEAL) is now its own rate. Recruits go straight from boot camp to BUDs now. But hey, what do i know, I'm only a chief that has worked at boot camp for the last three years and deals with Seal wannabe's on a first hand basis.

A SEAL is not a rate it is a complete seperate section of the USN. Your Recruiter can't grant you a SEAL contract. You will have to chose a rate that is eligible for SEAL then complete boot camp, then your 'A' School, then go to BUDS and then... maybe, just maybe you can be one of the 3% that pass and become SEALs.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Actually Raider: You need to have a "source rate" prior to becoming a SEAL that did not change. So the asker will still need to qualify for a source rate 'A' school that is relevant to the SEAL rating prior to testing for SEAL.

There is no waiver for such case like this, it was unwise for you to switch to active before knowing this.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	So you're saying that in the six months you were in the Reserves you did not recieve your first bonus payment?  It is likely you were released from the Reserves too early and are having your bonus recouped.  You need to write out what happened and your unit needs to submit a pay inquiry.  Things of this nature do not get "waived".  You either owe the money or you do not.  If you can go back through your old LES and prove that you did or did not recieve the first half of the bonus, that will be helpful.  They will also need your original reserve DD4's bonus annex.  Good luck.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I thought switching from reserves to active was considered career progression and you didn't have to pay back your bonus?  <br>  <br>  Hmm, going to have check that one out.<br>  <br>  Did you switch MOS's when you went active?

AA12349988	I like you am adopted in the UK, my adopted parents are / where (my mum died) fantastic and irreplaceable.  However just before Christmas tracked down my birth mother - one of the reason being that I wanted to know as much medical history as possible not just for me but for any biological children that I may have.  My wife and I are thinking about extending our family<br>  <br>  <br>  I also like you think that the adoption laws need changing but there are a couple of things that concern me about the infringements that your changes would take both legally and also emotionally.<br>  <br>  Legally - you have no rights to anyone medical history but your own, I dont have to share my history with anyone should I chose not to, and that includes my wife and children.  Assume I had been born with a hole in my heat and it was treated as a baby and I only had a small scar.  Unless I told anyone they wouldn't need to know but the knowledge could have wider implications on my family.<br>  <br>  Emotionally - When I contacted my biological mother I was 35 and emotionally ready, I did not know if she was alive or dead, in fact a few years earlier she had been rushed to hospital for emergency care - fortunately not hereditary but had it have been and I had a letter through telling me that my biological mother had terminal cancer and I needed to watch myself it may have opened up a whole place I didn't want to go.   Whilst at 35 I was a grounded, sensible mature person I was very different at 18.  I was an angry rebel and I am not sure how I would have managed such emotions.<br>  <br>  Your idea also opens up wider issues and whilst you focus on adoption their are many other people who dont know their family medical history - the results of one night stands, fathers that have moved on etc<br>  <br>  I am not suggesting that your not wrong in wanting to change the laws surrounding adoption, and they have been changed in the UK to a more open structure, however I do think you need to think about exactly what you want changing and how it impacts people of all ages.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you start with the following people<br>  <br>  1. Your local MP<br>  2. Jacqui Smith - Home Secretary <br>  3. Ed Balls Minister for Children.<br>  4. I would look at contacting charities and agancies to see what they have done/are doing.<br>  <br>  On a side note - have you contacted the agancy that placed you for adoption, when I went to trace my biological parents they had more information about the family background that I dont think my adopted parents had.  It didn't go into detail but it did say which of my biological grandparents where alive etc, you dont need to do anything with the information, but it may set your mind at rest.  - anyway best wishes to you and your brother.  I understand that everyone is different but if you want more information about my experience you are more than welcome to drop me an email.|`|M7GnRpd0aa	You can contact your MP but as most of them are pretty useless I would write to Jacqui Smith MP, Home Secretary, Cabinet Office, 70, Whitehall, London SW1A 2AS and then it will be passed to the correct department.|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	I agree with you, l have the same problem.|`|Fhjc0xbAaa	I think when a child is adopted there should be a record kept of the birth mother and if known the father and their parents and grandparents, just to record any cancers, glaucoma, diabetes, and any other ailment that could be in the child's genes.  <br>  Or course that may make it harder to find a placement for a child if there is some nasty illness looming in the past.<br>  It is not practical to keep records after the adoption unless the birth mothers consented, that would be difficult to keep track when peoples lives move on.<br>  <br>  To proceed I think the best way is to contact you MP or senator.|`|ho2hEqo8aa	sometimes the birth parents dont even know if their family is really screwed up|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	Contact your US Congressman or Senator or state Rep or Senator.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Since adoption is a state issue, you need to lobby your state legislature for changes.<br>  <br>  I have to tell you, though, that your desires may not match reality.  Do you suggest that a complete family medical history be kept for every adopted child?  Potentially that could be done for mothers, but you have to remember that most adoptions don't come from happily married parents.  In some cases the father is not known, or not known well enough for the mother to provide medical history.  In other cases, the father is known, but no longer around.  Does the adoption agency have to hunt him down and then somehow obtain a complete history of his family?<br>  <br>  Even mothers, when faced with the prospect of asking medical question of her whole family, will often balk, rather than publicize what may be a private matter for her.<br>  <br>  Trying to obtain some sort of medical document in advance is almost impossible, even in current 'open' adoptions.<br>  <br>  It's a great idea, I just don't think it is at all practical.

They sell it on the world market to the highest bidder, so...while drilling for oil here at home, might help keep costs lower if we keep quantities up...there is nothing to prevent these companies from selling all their oil overseas.<br>  <br>       We need research/development into alternative fuels.<br>  <br>       Then and only then can we tell the royal house of Saud to stick it where the Sun don''t shine.<br>  <br>       The U.S. cannot stay prosperous and stay a major power unless we break the oil addiction.|`|AA11086243	ideally we should move away from oil... <br>  <br>  we will run out... probably sometime in the next 100 years, you can either ignore that fact, or try and prepare for it...<br>  <br>  and electric cars burn more fossil fuels? really?

Becoming dependent on oil is bad regardless of where it comes from.|`|kX4JPvwwaa	I wouldn't "block" domestic drilling (as though I have that power anyway) so long as it was not in an area of land protected by law from human industry.  I don't appreciate our reliance on any type of oil, foreign or domestic.  But that doesn't matter.  Eventually, prices will change our habits more than my opinions ever will.<br>  <br>  This is how it works:  if we keep oil and gas really cheap by drilling and refining as much as we can (not to mention through enormous government subsidies), it inherently encourages us to USE as much as we can.  Our energy use is subject to constraints in the longer-term.  Oil and gas will not remain cheap throughout our lifetimes, no matter what we do, because of the rise of other nations.  <br>  <br>  Liberal democrats aren't creating our long-term energy problems.  The economic expansion of more populous countries is.

eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Your question doesn't make sense.  I'm sorry.  If things have already been invented why would they need to be researched?  Nothing is on the backburner and being brought forth by the stimulus.  It would eventually make money the private sector would have invested just as much as the government.  What's in the stimulus is money for green energy projects that already exist such as the clean cole plant that was shut down for being ineffective several years ago.  <br>  There is money for other green research.  Much of the scientific spending is for global warming, so it really depends on how you feel about it.  The medical money  is for electronic charting that big cities already use.<br>  <br>  Oooh K, you're talking about R&D funds.  Here's an article that'll help you.  There are research funds in the bill, but it's mostly construction and equipment:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/obamas-2009-stimulus-package-grant-16-billion-r-d-funding" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowpublic.com/world/obamas-20...</a>|`|HkhfzbLhaa	You are so naive that it is ridiculous.
3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	I researched your question extensively.  The U.S. achieved unprecedented economic growth as it was struggling to recover from the Great Depression, but it was not sustainable and fell as quickly as it rose.  The economy continued to be volatile until it finally stabilized and recovered in about 1938.  Since 1970, GDP growth has averaged 3.16 percent per year, after inflation.  If our economy grows as high as Obama is predicting, it will be because our economy is unstable and teetering on the edge of collapse, not stabilizing and growing.  However, by 2011 Mr. Obama will be in full campaign mode for his second term, and the sheeple will be fooled into thinking he successfully saved us from Bush and the Republicans and will re-elect him by an overwhelming majority.<br>  <br>  Thank you for encouraging me to do so much research.  I had the time to do it, and I learned a lot.  Now I have to throw up.|`|cIHBpcREaa	Yes.  $4 trillion spending in off the back ($1 trillion stimulus bill + 3 more in the budget).|`|hJ284RPaaa	spend spend spend<br>  <br>  then obama will sell us to the chinese as slaves|`|QkfGYIcxaa	yes they have|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	At least the money will be spent here

Confidence is what we really need. Confidence will bring the investors back but they have to know thing can get no worse off than they are when they dump the money back. I feel there is still a way to make things worse and so I hold on. The thing here is what if the dollar crashes and the values goes to crap then we all loose. I got this feeling the time is not far off for investment to start a real rally. We have a choice weak dollar or slow growth in the market. A new floor must be built on sound and solid investing and the people that took me for a ride need to see what jail is like.|`|diZoW49Zaa	With no investors, you have no growth, just stagnation.

bXJp3r0baa	Quite honestly, fewer guns on the streets sounds fine to me. It's tough to feel safe when citizens can own high-powered weaponry, and our weak gun control causes serious issues in our neighbors as well, particularly Mexico. But I guess you could be in favor of higher crime rates and Mexican drug cartels. It's a free country.|`|VVCpJFxtaa	Which laws are they trying to weaken? The ones the Supreme Court has already said were unconstitutional. Good I hope they do decide to stand up for the constitution. It is the oath they took when they became Senators.

Didn't think so.|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	The right to bear arms it's in the Constitution check it out!! Ask the victims of Tienamen square China or any other country where people can't  own guns how things are working out for them... P.S.  since they legalized concealed handguns in Texas the gun homicide rate has dropped consistently,  a criminal will always get guns legal or not! Gun control just creates a bigger black market for illegal guns.|`|yprHJNHAaa	Guns in DC?  Do you know what you are saying?  NO ONE should have guns in DC!  Except the police and law enforcement.

I don't want to comment on what the gun laws should be, but I don't support federal intervention in local affairs.  Which other state has to pass gun laws specified by Congress in order to have a vote?  What if Congress told the state of Texas "you can't seat your representatives until you pass such-and-such  a law"?

I mean it IS D.C. they should be exempt from what happens every where else in the country, right?|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	You mean those gun laws that keep the law abiding citizens defenseless so the criminals can commit their crimes unmolested?

The day that Obama took office, it was at 89.<br>  <br>  In reality, the deficit should make the dollar stronger.  In fact, a strong dollar at this juncture isn't necessarily good.  A weak dollar makes American made products cheaper than products made overseas, which means we import less and export more, helping the manufacturing sector.<br>  <br>  But if the dollar gets stronger, it will hamper efforts for the recovery of the economy.  The federal deficit can cause the value of the dollar to go up.  To finance the deficit, the Government will offer T-Bills which will be bought by investors.  Many of the investors will be overseas.  They will need to use dollars to buy the T-Bills, and to get dollars, they will have to buy them.  This will raise the vaule of the dollar.<br>  <br>  Nice try with the scare tactics.  You might want to try checking your facts next time.  And speaking of facts, the dollar is up today.|`|cIHBpcREaa	The paper and art work on the bill cost more than the value of the bill alone.

Having sampled their wares, it is not to my liking.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Stewart is one of the worst comedians I have ever seen, and I feel bad even using the word "comedian" to describe him because I think it does a disservice to comedians across the globe.  Making funny faces and strange catchphrases in a funny voice is not humourous, it is childish.  And he is obviously being a partisan shill because every other guest he invites to the show makes fun of George W Bush or sharply criticizes him, both of which stopped being funny 5 years ago when it become an old routine for people who don't have any creativity.<br>  <br>  Stephen Colbert, on the other hand, is HILARIOUS.  I am conservative, and find his deadpan delivery and his sardonic sense of humor as well as the feigned arrogance a delightful parody of political commentators.  I probably would have voted for him if he ended up getting his campaign off the ground too. :D<br>  <br>  Strange that this is the case, since both of these guys are supposed to have the same writers.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I'm fiscally conservative, but pretty liberal elsewise, but yes, I love my boys Colbert and Stewart!|`|cZypvAK8aa	Sometimes I watch Colbert.

If we don't children will lose their access to it and more families will stay intact. We can't have that. Sarcasm, of course.<br>  <br>  Btw, the stoned drivers are already on the road. Keeping it illegal hasn't done a thing to stop consumption and driving under the influence. Neither has the lies that are supposed to pass for drug education. Legalization, regulation, and the truth might achieve better results.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Marijuana would never become legal due to the government not being able to control it and tax it like they do with cigarettes and alcohol. i used to be a marijuana smoker and found that it made my health condition (generalized anxiety) worse for me to deal with. It would make no difference to me whether it was or wasn't legal. It is still the same drug that has the same benefits and the same disadvantages to my mental and physical health. <br>  <br>  There are people that are ignorant and hate it because it is illegal and know nothing about it but these people are probally all smokers or drinkers, these substances are just as harmful if not more than smoking marijuana. I read somewhere that Ecstasy is less harmful than alcohol. Wonder what these folks thing about that?? haha|`|mTwn8p79aa	There's no logical reason to make marijuana illegal that can't also be applied to alcohol.  Your proof is right here in your answers, in an argument about whether marijuana should be legalized someone made an argument that applies to alcohol and then felt compelled to put a comment about our president . . . see what I mean when I said there's no logical argument?  That's the type of person that's making sure it's still illegal.  She'd probably like to mandate we all have to go to her church on Sunday too.  What?  It'd just make us all better people, right?<br>  <br>  I've read a little information that marijuana was made illegal due to racist law makers.  Apparently it was all hispanic and black famers that were smoking marijuana when it was first catching on so it was made illegal so they would have a reason to harass them.|`|RhDPB70Baa	When people don't like something they think that it's evil.  They don't realize that people have different opinions and making something legal does not mean that they have to do it.  It's a holdover from the puritan mindset of "we have to protect everyone from sin" that outlawed everything in America's formative years.|`|44rorVVmaa	You can get legal weed, just go to<br>  http:// www.

You should go on tvshack.net and watch "in pot we trust" (2007). It was very enlightening.|`|a7Lmyxmkaa	Well I just asked the same question, and it looks like we have some of the same haters on your page that was on mine, but anyway...aside from the haters of the sport of smoking I think that people who dont like it dont look at all the positives of it. Claifornia spends (Illegally) around 2 billion a year on bud...got that off CNN.com in case anyone was wondering, but yes thats a lot of non-taxed money that the stae could use to idk...rebuild all those homes that burned, or whatever. Another thing...my tax dollars are paying for a 12 month sentence becasue a guy got picked up for having a 20 sack on him...what kind of bull is that. It would dramatically lower our prisions inmate count. Imagine if all the nick, and dime baggers could roam free and smoke as they please....what a wonderful world this would be. Pot heads are calm ppl. They dont like to go anywhere once the smoking has started...the only thing america will have to worry about if they legalize BUD would be the obesity rate shooting sky high...b/c we all know it gives you the munchies...hhahahahahahahaha

The Civil War was won by the Republican Goverment under Lincoln.  A Civil War will not happen. Most military bases are located in the South. Conservatives will fight for this Country, Most liberals would rally in a peace demonstration and would let themselves be shot because they do not believe in having the right to bare arms as most Americans value.

159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	These are the children of the Third Communist International.<br>  <br>  When the Communist and Socialist movements first came to the United States, they faced a huge problem: the United States didn't have a strict Rich vs Peasant class structure. They borrowed clever ideas from "The Trust," and got to work. In the 20's and 30's, they determined that they should split the U.S. body politic into multiple factions, encouraging a black class, a women class, and---as all socialists have done, a student class. In other words, take over the universities. Now that their students have attained political power, they needed a device that would destroy Free-Enterprise market systems, thus installing State Capitalism. This little bomb was called The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. It was slow burning, but it appears it has been very good at slowly destroying free markets.<br>  The Cloward-Piven Strategy is an not independent or new revolutionary concept. The people who have implemented it are operatives, not simply dupes or useful idiots, of the Ghost of the Third ComIntern. They are now elected officials.<br>  <br>  Thanks for bringing this to Y!A's attention.

HkhfzbLhaa	Liberals created the problem through the Community Reinvestment Act, aka forcing banks to give loans to people who can't afford them. Demand went up, prices went up, and the bubble popped. If you bought a house you couldn't afford without understanding the CONTRACT THAT YOU SIGNED then it is your own fault and you should lose your house. Myself and my children should not have to pay for your mistakes. Besides, how are you going to learn from them if the government bails you out? The market will turn around, but you have to let it find the bottom, which is what it is trying to do. But every time you prop up the losers who made bad decisions it delays the inevitable and costs us all more.

Infact his political machine follows more of a socialist perspective rather than a Facist view. One thing that has kept my eyes open is the hope he brings to most Americans. I just don't agree with socilaist ideas as stated before, however, he has an ability to inspire most Americans that have had little faith in our goverment.  <br>  <br>  Most extreme liberals have a rather uncanny disposition for their views. They would rather protest than incorporate their practice. Yet at the same time. Most socilaist have no clue about the history of Socialism. I am a Historian with a deep understaning of socilist reform history. I would not consider socilaist programs to be as successful in this country and the way our democracy is set up. <br>  <br>  My brother in law is an ifatic soiclaist- with out the true knowledge of Sociliast views. After I gave him a comprehnsive history lesson on the failures and policies of Socilist history he has kept his lipps tighten on extremist views of socialism. <br>  <br>  Just remember folks- for more than 60 years we have fought to prevent Socialist views created by Marks and Engels. Socilist views always lead to commnism and a dictatorship that creates political genocide of others who express a differnt opinion. <br>  <br>  The formula for Socilaist movements begin with a Political Purging of its opponent. Our nation was not created to have a one sided goverment. The form of democracy is to debate and argue the points to bring balance to the extremes of both conservative and liberal views. Thats what makes our nation such a great nation and differnt from European and Other nations that lack the oppertunity to have a say. This past election was about the needs of the people. So let them have their run. It flips both ways. <br>  <br>  Obama is running our goverment-lets see if we conservatives can make a direct application to help solve the problems rather than fuss over the issues. There is always a time to debate and find solutions. <br>  <br>  For all of you un-Educated Socilaist-study your history and wake up. Socailism is a bad entity. Planned and fixed economies fail.

I think they just use them and they'll never accept gays|`|AA11993638	And you know this is fact how? because this is what the media tells you? Since there has seldom been votes which define these things, and why should they be protected from job discrimination as a special class? they are covered under most things in one way or another. States can add this classification at anytime to their constitution, as they can add to the federal laws but cannot do less than the federal law. How do you know it is only the republicans that would vote against such things? Many democrats do not agree with these things either. Did you know many republicans accept gays, but in the context which does not view them as being an actual class of individuals requiring special rights under the law. Do I as a single woman deserve rights that a man does not have, or that an individual who is black does not have if I am white? Maybe if the far left would stop making a big deal about how everyone is the same but yet they are so different and that some people deserve special rights while other deserve to be held back, this would not be any kind of issue. I do not have a problem with gays have the same rights, as already written in the law, as any other person, I do not have a problem with civil unions, but do believe that "marriage" is defined as one man and one woman, otherwise what will it be defined as next, one man and one animal? or two men and three women? In many states gays are allowed to adopt. They can be hired for the same job as anyone else.|`|8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	Wow wow wow! Gays and Lesbians are protected like anybody else against sexual discrimination on the job under the federal Equal Employment Opportunity, You know where that law lead by the way? many "good" employee have been sued for saying things like "it must be her PMS" .... how does that contradict with the "freedom of speech and expression?"<br>  However gay and lesbians can easily act anyway they want, dress anyway they want and publicly express their sexual orientation all that based on???? " freedom of speech and expression"<br>  I see that the law applies to one category but not the other one.<br>  That is, i assume what you call equality????????<br>  Civil union has been one of the objective of all parties to solve the problem however gays and lesbians refuse it because THEY WANT marriage. <br>  Adoption is a very dangerous issue. You want to go through centuries of research that emphasize on the necessity of a family cell for the safeguard and well being of a child that includes a father and a mother, one of each respective sex. <br>  In a time where families are already hurting and having an identity crisis you want to bring in another aspect of it?<br>  Well good luck. As long as there will be an once of morality in this nation ... it won't happen.<br>  PS: Blacks and Women have been around the Republican party for a long time ... could i be that you have no idea who was your secretary of state for 4 years?

NOTc1b9saa	Yes, the universe is TEEMING with life!<br>  <br>  What people dont realize is that there are many different dimensions of *reality*, most higher than our own..3D is just one *note on the piano keyboard*, and many species have evolved way beyond our own, although we originally came from 5D and above but chose to manifest as human, KNOWING that when we took on our physical *jacket* to exist here our brain would not let us recall our true past, power and purpose, for the human DNA was genetically engineered from our original 12 strand down to the present twin strand 13,000 yrs ago by the Annunaki, negative ET*s who came to Earth and decided they wished to own us and our Planet, and people in limited 3D consciousness are much easier to control than 5D ones!.><br>  <br>  The system of society they set up STILL operates today, *authorities* set up over us all telling us what we can and cant do, and they include govts, police, medical, education, and even religions, all *slanted* so as to keep us under control and separated by uncertainty, fear, lack and limitation, but THAT is about the change!!<br>  <br>  ET*s have ALWAYS been in contact with Earth..Many indigenous peoples have met them and there are many cave drawings of Starships and Beings with strange headgear on..<br>  <br>  Although the U.S. govt denies there are ET*s (a growing number of countries have begun to release their UFO files now), nevertheless, it has been approached many times by both negative and positive ET*s offering assistance and, while the positive ones set a proviso that our governments set a course towards peace and harmony on Earth AND WERE TURNED DOWN EVERY TIME, the negative ET*s offered advanced weaponry and technology in exchange for the abduction of numbers of humans, AND CONTRACTS WERE DULY SIGNED!..That*s how the *Starwars* space technology and even solid state electronics arrived on Earth!..GOVERNMENTS LIE!..Negative ET*s still work alongside the military in Area 51 etc!<br>  <br>  In higher states of consciousness, one can travel by thought..Many ET*s travel between dimensions, and they are the ones whose ships generally appear as Lights rather than solid and metallic..<br>  <br>  I asked for and received a physical teleported visit from three non human Pleiadeans in 1992 and they *spoke* to us by writing via my trance medium partner (now ex) and talked about the changes to our world now beginning as the approach to 2012, when NOT the *End of the World* is predicted but *The End of the World AS WE KNOW IT*, for we have already begun to experience many changes that will be completed then due to the date 21 Dec 2012 bringing about an amazing astronomical and astrological alignment in the Heavens signalling the end of a 26,000 cycle or age, and the begining of the next, and between *ages*, the *rules* always change..<br>  <br>  Even this current financial and banking implosion is MEANT to be happening to make way for something MUCH better for us, the masses, unlike now when only the elite, the Illuminati, who control govts and all big business, profit greatly at OUR expense..Big changes coming after this current period when this old negative and fearful societal pattern collapses in on itself, as it must..People will be fearful, but help will arrive at the right moment to transform our reality for the better!|`|oojO4WAraa	There is no doubt in my mind that there is other life out there.  <br>  <br>  I think religious teachings are the reason most people have a hard time believing in life on other planets.

Now you can argue that there might be extraordinary means which we do not understand, but no one has come close to proving that such travel is anything more than science fiction.

CvFajKPUaa	Tells me that the farther we get away from the conservative based ideas that the US was founded the more problems we face.  Even obama uses the 50's and early 60's of an example of when this country was at its finest.  Thing is at that time the country was made up of almost all white people who were all pulling in the same direction and didn't expect a hand out.  In fact white people in those days would rather starve than take hand outs.<br>  <br>  New York city is a perfect example of what your talking about.  Rudy went in facing huge crime problems and a other wise disastrous mess.  In just a few months he was able to turn the city around.  Crime rates dropped faster than obama's pants do when he walks into Barney Franks apartment.<br>  <br>  Chicago on the other hand is a waste land.  Crime and poverty are rampant and they had to deal with moronic leaders like barack obama who pushed things like sub-prime loans in the 90's.

The dollar is in danger of not being the World Standard. If you have any understanding of economics you should realize that the HUGE debt we are quickly accumulating will ultimately devalue the dollar. I would bet that if China ( and others) didn't already hold such a huge IOU of US dollars they would not be even considering loaning more to us. However, they have to much to lose by not supporting us. However, at some point they will decide to stop chasing a bad risk. When this lack of confidence unfolds then the US dollar will take a back seat to another, to be determined, currency. When that occurs who (Nation) will assume the driver's seat of international finance. Unfortunately, we all know the dollar ( or some other currency) influences every nation.

If one were to be created today... the U.S. would have the most prominate influence in it.<br>  <br>  The right wing reference is due to the fact of conservatives... we believe that change within government should be slow and difficult to accomplish because too much change or change that happens too quickly will lead to destablization of the government. Liberal views tend to be all about change and try to use that change to promote equality on a social level. But with that being said.. both conservatives and liberals fear a NWO. Cons fear it because of the huge change and disassembly of current government structures. Liberals fear it because it loses control of special interest groups.<br>  <br>  One day it will probably happen... but it will first start out like the EU... several countries adopting and sharing common institutions which later turn to sharing and adopting of government institutions and laws (the Euro is a government controlled currency) which will create power blocs around the world.<br>  <br>  Eventually these power blocs will merge (violently and peacefully) until finally only one exists in which there will be multiple parties.

I suspect Liberals are very much engaged with charities, both donating money as well as time.  The redistribution of wealth in America has been going on for over 100 years years in the form of Federal, state and local taxes.  A small amount goes to actual poor, while society as whole benefits from infrastructure, schools, research, military, etc.  This redistribution adds immensely to our standard of living as well keeping us from being like,say, Albania.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Yes, many people assume that welfare = charity.  They refuse to recognize that forced taxation for the supposed purpose of helping others ultimately leads to resentment... especially when the people have no say in where their money goes, or even if it really helps someone in need.

Regular people are losing their jobs and homes everywhere for reasons pretty much out of their control and I don't see any of your "hard worker" giving out any charity so in the end I don't really care if it's called "giving back", "redistribution of wealth", or just plain "Socialism." The people that are responsible for this should have to make some amends. We are by no means putting them in the poor house. Hopefully we have learned that you can't deregulate the economy too much and expect greedy people to keep it running smoothly.|`|RVABrMeSaa	You are right that capitalism and charity are 100% compatible, however when the average citizen's charity dollars are not enough to cover the essentials: fire dept, police dept., bridges, libraries, schools, hurricane relief, tornado relief, etc. It then becomes necessary to have a larger pot to work with, hence taxes. For many years my family has contributed to the Catholic church and there are many great catholic charities, however I never got a vote on where the money I gave went. Don't remember it going towards firemen or policemen or town hall; went to church buildings, church schools.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Amen to that!  They're not confused, they know exactly what they're doing!  But, they're trying to convince us that it's right thing to do!  I give to charities, and food banks all the time, but now I'm not going to be able to, because I'm going to have to put that towards taxes for the gov. to distribute, and the things they want to give the money to, for the most part, I don't agree with!  It's bullsh*t!|`|RcCJSSMPaa	No, but you obviously do.<br>  <br>  I have a small problem with my hard earned tax dollars funding a war with a country who did nothing to us, for the profit of a very few.|`|AA11151307	Why do you always confuse our failed capitalist-based system with charity?<br>  <br>  Neither one is truly compatible.<br>  <br>  You just think it is.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Yes.

Then, Bush took it to 4% and people were screaming for his head!<br>  <br>  Now, with one fell swoop of a pen, Barack Obama has taken the deficit to 13.5% of GDP.  Talk about a double standard hard at work.  Oh yeah, it's for government spending, so that makes it okay.

All they had to say during the elections was that the Democrats would spend a lot less then McCain and the republicans. In fact if you remember Obama during one of the debates on economy made a point that McCain budget plan was more costly than his. Today he has passed by McCain's and he is looking in the rear view mirror.<br>  The secret is that once you have brain washed ignorant voters with empty rhetoric you can pretty much justify anything since they have really no clue as to what you are talking about.<br>  Many keep saying how Obama "inherited" the huge deficit. LOL ... weren't Democrats present during Bush term? and weren't they actually a majority for the last two years of his second term? Wow! now you see ... they have no recollection of that very important fact. As if the president can just do whatever he wants without congress. Yeah right! lol.<br>  Democrats or should i say liberals cater to ignorants because they are easy target and can easily be swayed. This is actually one of the reasons why Republicans don't do well anymore. They are so clear in what they stand for that many just don't agree with them ... but they do understand the principles as oppose to voting blindly for the big unknown.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	I'm not a liberal but I sense that the reason the Obama deficits are OK with them is that the money is being spent on them, not some war, or some hurricane, or national security.  Anyway, if Bush could do it then Obama can do it too and the Republicans have no business being hypocrites about it. You know the old story.  Of course, what is being done to our future and that of our children and grand children is beyond their vision.

AA12068233	How’s the old saying go? He who represents himself has a fool for a client?<br>  <br>  Despite what some MADD cultists above may have told you, it’s ALWAYS best to hire a skilled, experienced attorney to represent you when charged with any serious crime. The prosecutor is not on your side. The judge is not on your side. You NEED an advocate who is.|`|AA10604086	He can do one of the two things..<br>  1. get an attorney, or<br>  2. be prepared for the court to ram it up his ***. <br>   California DUI second offense is 4-30 days in jail.Does he want the 4, or does he prefer the 30???<br>  What can a lawyer do that you can';t do on your own?? Stop you from  making a complete fool out of yourself.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Well, here's what you're looking at: A remote possibility of challenging the accuracy of the method used to determine that this man was legally intoxicated at the time of the second DUI; trying to exclude the admission of the previous DUI from his driving abstract.<br>  <br>  Judges don't take too kindly to drunk driving defendants, especially those who don't have a lawyer. Think "throw the book at them" and you'll have the idea.<br>  <br>  You need a lawyer who may or may not advise a not guilty plea. I would not advise that. Instead, I would advise a nolo contendere plea along with voluntary admission into an alcohol treatment program. This may mitigate the license suspension time, since a court respects honesty a lot more than it does an attempt to evade responsibility.<br>  <br>  Your friend needs to accept responsibility for his actions and straighten his act out. The next time he's behind the wheel after drinking could cost someone their life!!|`|mTwn8p79aa	Yes.  The attorneys have a relationship with the prosecutor that you don't.  They've also, hopefully, got a better handle on the laws so they might be able to find you a loophole.  And finally, with an attorney, they know you'll take it to trial if you have to, so your bargaining will have more leverage.|`|AA10118655	He should not waste his money on a lawyer. If he didn't learn the first time not to drink and drive, he deserves to be found guilty and, hopefully, spend some time in jail.

The only thing 'revolutionary' about the Obama administration is that the public is being informed about everything done by the White House and by the congress in general.  No more secret deals and secret expenditures.  This is making all of us more active in government affairs and more hopeful about America's future.  But it will not be enough to silence the hate-mongers.  The best thing for us to do is just ignore them and do what we feel is right for ourselves, for our communities and for our country.<br>  <br>  One big reason why President Obama is still so well-loved is that he is pursuing the promises he made during the campaign and he is listening to the American people - and this is a revolutionary First for us, that's for sure.

Not the Supreme Court who has turned down twelve times the opportunity to either confirm or deny he is legally entitled to be enthroned. These cases were all rejected without consideration. Also Nobam held meetings individually with eight for the nine justices in an ex parte manner which is suspicious by itself.<br>  <br>  He has spent approximately one million dollars of his personal wealth on legal fees to keep his official birth records concealed from the public eye. Why would a legally qualified candidate do that?<br>  <br>  This is another assault on our Constitution.

Otherwise check with your DHS, explain the situation and see if there are any benefits they can offer, such as food banks and such to at least keep your family fed.

u6ALw1gAaa	That would depend on the individual.  Usually after a shooting the Officer has to be cleared by a psychologist in order to return to duty.  We are all individuals and react to stressful things differently.  The killing of another person, no matter how justified the Officer may be, can have an impact on them mentally.|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	I asked this question on a different site, and the answer I got was that it might be traumatic, but at least those officers could go home at night to their families.  Also, there's a lot of second-guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking done by the public and police administration, and there's a lot of paperwork to be done.  I got the impression that the officers on that site really don't care if criminal scumbags got shot and killed.|`|9VRwBeATaa	Real life isn't like the movies where you have police officers participating in shoot outs every day. Regulations are set in place to reduce the amount of shootings as much as possible. Every police officer who participates in a shooting gets mandatory therapy and has to write up paper work of the event leading up to the shooting. If a police officer shows no remorse of having killed someone, then their ability to be fit as a police officer is questioned.|`|PddGC0lYaa	It depends who the cop is. Some do, some do not.<br>  <br>  I would feel guilty, because I'm taking someone's life, and I'm not God. I can't make that kind of a decision. But on the other hand, I am saving mine or someone else in trade. A lot of people recognize that last part, which is why they don't feel guilty.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of stress and depression in the job, you just gotta know what kind of person you are.|`|b8svqAMAaa	I agree with ghoulie.  If I had to shoot and kill someone to save my own life, I would have no regrets.  Of course, you will always know that you took a life and no one feels good about that.

a66nvk0taa	If you want to live in Switzerland permanently you need a Swiss residence permit. Getting such a permit and obtaining Swiss residency is the same thing. Unless you are Swiss, you will need such a document to live in Switzerland. This applies to citizens of a EU country too.<br>  <br>  A Swiss residence permit is a similar document to the US "green card" or French "carte de séjour". It is an official document, granted by federal and cantonal authorities but issued by the Swiss city where you will live. It specifies the conditions for your stay in Switzerland, such as duration, if you can bring your family with you, wether or not you can work, etc|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	switzerland is a very difficult country to get into. <br>  <br>  you will be required to be a resident for 12 years before you are eligible to become a citizen.
kZeu2Dyzaa	Ok, there is some misinformation going on here which I will clean up:<br>  <br>  1. Obama's economic packages consist of more than just the "Stimulus". There is also the bank bailout, automaker bailout, mortgage bailout, and a second "stimulus" in the works. The total will be in the area of $2-3 Trillion.<br>  <br>  2. The National Deficit and the National Debt are two different things. The National Deficit is the amount that we are in the red this year and the National Debt is the amount total amount that the government is currently behind. The current National Deficit pre-stimulus was about $1.2 Trillion and the National Debt was about $9.5 Trillion.<br>  <br>  3. The Bush Administration inherited a National Debt of $6.5 Trillion and increased it to $9.5 Trillion over 8 years (including two wars). That comes to $375 Billion in deficit spending each year (on average).|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Yeah. . .  Tell that to all of the families that have lost a family member to that war how money is so much more valuable than their family members' life.|`|IasHMWM2aa	No, the Stimulus bill is still less than the cost of the War on Iraq. We have spent well over a trillion wasted in Iraq for nothing but death and misery, no victory.<br>  <br>  Bush left us with a national deficit of more than 10 trillion dollars. You need to ask the person who claims that it triples the national debt why the debt is not over 30 trillion dollars. When they hem and haw, you can point out that they are lying!<br>  Call them a LIAR right to their FACE.<br>  <br>  Do not listen to the liars. Here is the current national deficit.

Sure, going into Iraq wasn't a popular move, but same with going into Korea and Vietnam. And let me tell you, as a Korean-American, I'm very glad that the US helped South Korea.<br>  <br>  Bush wasn't afraid of making the unpopular choices. Love him or hate him, if he wanted something done, he certainly wasn't passive about it.<br>  <br>  Another person who had a very low approval rating while in office: Abraham Lincoln, who was, like Bush, also made fun of for his appearance I might add.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* For the person who said least intelligent apparently doesn't know his history.

QX2xnrhWaa	I can't come up with a specific plan but I do believe in small governments.  the very idea of coming up with a plan to aid those workers sound familiar, though.  Being French American, I can see how France - which is largely a socialist country - has way too many civil servants ("fonctionnaires").  It's been a drain on the economy for a long time - things escalated in the 1980ies when the country had its first socialist president, and it's been getting worse since.<br>  I don't want that for America.  I'm a Ron Paul supporter and believe in a small government, not a big government.|`|oBviF550aa	Maybe if more Government workers were fired, it would motivate them.

ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Because that is racist.  You are comparing him to a monkey which has been a racial slur for many many years.  In certain soccer stadiums in Europe, for example, they make monkey chants at the black players and throw bananas on the field.  Why don't you critique his policies etc. instead of calling him names...that is if you don't want your friends and family to think you are racist.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	So you don't like people that eat banana's? All kinds of people eat those things every day. As far as I know they come from So. America.I have never seen one single photo of Obama any where near a banana.<br>  Call him a commie instead. More accurate.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	I think it's way less about racism and more about maturity level. They should be concerned that you are calling someone a stupid name like that! Dude, that's like calling someone stupid head or poopy face! LOL Come on, are you 12?

If you didn't like Bush, would you call him a banana eater?  Plenty of people eat bananas.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Maybe because you're referring to him as a monkey? I don't really care, but I'm just saying. You could think that way about all black people.|`|D5tIByciaa	maybe you could call him some nasty name that doesn't imply he is a monkey|`|kakNiAVOaa	because you show you don't like him by pointing out he is black and think he has a closer relation to monkeys.  You don't call somebody fat if they're not, you would say it because you think they/re fat.  So it seems as if your calling him this because you relate him to monkeys and that's the only reason you don't like him.  If you going to name call, at least pick a name that is true, not that i promote name calling haha.|`|dyAMG21Laa	Maybe you could find a different way to refer to Pres. Obama than what you're using.  Especially something with less racial overtones than the one you're using.  If you dislike someone, you really don't have to label him/her anything.|`|pkHiGVYEaa	Probably because you are making racist comments toward the guy.

He is trying to do the right thing for this country.  He is doing a lot more that some of the other president have done.

Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.<br>  It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any<br>  manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed<br>  weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment<br>  or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast<br>  doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by<br>  felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms<br>  in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or<br>  laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of<br>  arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those<br>  “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition<br>  of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	Of course we have the right to own a gun. We are the only civilized country to do so.

It was fast and cheap.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Sorry but I can't believe that the judge would not inform you that your license was being suspended. They handle too many cases such as this on a daily basis to overlook telling you you cannot drive for a specified amount of time.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Ignorance of the law is not a defense. It doesn't matter that you obtained insurance before you went to court. The matter that brought you before the court was the fact that you did not have insurance when you were pulled over for speeding. Getting it after the fact doesn't count.<br>  <br>  If you were at the same address that appears on your driver's license, lots of luck trying to claim that you never received notification from the DMV that your license was suspended. If you moved and didn't notify the DMV, that will also be on you as well. Same thing if you didn't have a forwarding address when you moved.<br>  <br>  Call the Legal Aid society and see if you qualify for Pro Bono assistance. You may qualify for some sort of hardship consideration, but that will be up to an attorney in your area to advise. You should accept responsibility for your actions instead of trying to point fingers at everybody else.

Time will determine which one he should be classified under.
bxBi1Z8Eaa	I am afraid the ASVAB doesn't quite work like that... let's say you score a 108 but show a great apptitude in the mechanical or mathematics sections while scoring low in the English section. Well, if you go in "Open Contract" the Marines would lean towards giving you a MOS in Engineering or Motor T. What I would suggest doing is asking for a "Guaraunteed Contract" for the MP MOS. Most likely you will have to enlist for a year longer, and the MOS is only guaraunteed if you pass all the MP schooling and requirements. Find out what those requirements are by talking to your recruiter. Good luck to you!|`|BRyRtQSvaa	5|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Please don't join the Marines!

AA11593583	Only two years. <br>  <br>  But they came in under the pretext of impeaching Bush and being more fiscally responsible. Neither of which they have done.<br>  <br>  Now in my opinion the only thing I dislike more than the way Obama says, "I inherited a trillion dollar deficit". It the way the Democrats applaud when he says it.<br>  <br>  Unless Harold Tucker was completely wrong. Here's how the budget goes. 1. The President presents a proposed budget to Congress. That like a kids list to Santa. 2. Congress goes over the proposed budget and changes it as they see fit, line by line. When the House and Senate have made all the changes they mutually desire they forward the approved budget to the President. 3. The President can either sign or veto the budget in mass. The President cannot change a thing in the budget approved by Congress. If he should veto the budget the whole thing goes back to the House and Senate for veto override. If the veto is not over ridden, it's rewritten. And it goes back to the President to sign or veto.<br>  <br>  So to insinuate the reason Obama inherited a trillion dollar deficit is totally Bush and the Republicans fault is 100% incorrect.|`|AA11424005	Nothing and nowhere.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Correction:  two years, not four.

Family<br>  <br>  Generally, to immigrate by employment you need to be a college educated professional with at least 2 years of experience.  Right now degrees in the health care field and information technology are good.  Also, a degree in primary or secondary education, with an emphasis on mathematics, would make you very attractive to American school districts.<br>  <br>  The other option is to be petitioned by a family member.  If you don't have any family in the USA you could do it by marriage.  Now, I'm not telling you to get married to an American just to immigrate.  That's immoral and illegal.

However, if you want to come here legally, you will first need a passport. You can live here for 3 months with a passport before you have to return home. While you are here, if you find an employer to sponsor you, you can apply for a work visa and stay here to work. If you are a student, you can apply and be accepted into a university and get a student visa, which will allow you to stay here throughout school.

If there were no Republican administrations, we wouldn't have such poor economies in the first place.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	Depression may bust that baloon|`|AA10079277	That's a strange way of thinking.<br>  <br>  The republicans as of late have strayed far from where they should be.  People who generally support the republcians in office have been dissastified with them, so much so they did not vote to keep many of them in office in 2006.<br>  <br>  The problem is they've been spending too much money.  They've been acting like liberal democrats.  Perhaps not quite as bad, but bad enough.  Just look at how the economy was sluggish in from 2000 to 2006.  <br>  <br>  However, once the democrats got control in 2006, the economy really started to tank, and tank fast.  So when we act a little liberal, things don't seem to go well with the economy.  When we act very liberal, the economy tanks.  I cannot see a reason why anyone would ever want the democrats in control, other than to piss off the republicans to punish them to force them to start being fiscal conservatives again.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	I don't think republicans are really good in any economy in my lifetime, but Democrats do excel during recessions when there is free labor and no capital to invest.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Democrats have also done good in boom time, see Clinton administration where he balanced the budget for a good example.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Figures don't lie, but liars figure.

LVZdzPmpaa	A community (city, village, county) will post a notice when they need applicants for the Police Academy. There are certain requirements, like a high school education, good health, physical fitness, etc. Some departments vary in their requirements, but generally those three things would be required.<br>  <br>  You apply, get several screenings and interviews, take a battery of psychological tests, have a background check, references, etc. This process can take up to a year. If you qualify on all counts, you would enter the Police Academy and take your training, which is rigorous and demanding. Not everyone completes it.<br>  <br>  A lot of police candidates have a military background but this is not required. Being a police officer requires a lot of discipline and training, which military personnel know about. I think that's why it is a good fit.<br>  <br>  Many of today's police officers have some college. To advance through the ranks, I think college is beneficial, though I do not know if it is required.<br>  <br>  In the outlying areas, like in the counties and townships, they often have small police forces and rely on the county sheriff.<br>  <br>  Each state also has a State Police Force, the qualifications for which are far more rigorous.<br>  <br>  You can read online at a number of sites about police training, degrees in law enforcement, etc. I don't know about citizenship requirements, but I would imagine that most candidates are U.S. citizens and residents of the areas in which they want to work. <br>  <br>  There are issues of immigration, which is a nightmare these days, unless of course you are a terrorist and/or a Palestinian refugee. Getting a work permit then is another matter entirely.<br>  <br>  Being a law enforcement official here is an honorable, essential career. We would be in one hell of a mess were it not for our cops. People who badmouth the police are very often those who have not been able to talk themselves out of the messes they've created for themselves. <br>  <br>  The police do not harass people who don't need harassing. It's up to each of us to behave. When we don't, that's where the police come in. Most folks who have run in with the police have brought it all on themselves.<br>  <br>  Good luck pursuing your dream!|`|6Gfz125Paa	You would need a degree from a college and then enroll in police academy.  <br>  <br>  You need to be a US citizen or permanent resident.  Becoming a resident requires a sponsor, which can be an employer.

AA11993638	If a school leases a lot why the heck would they allow anyone to build on it? If the lot is within the locality of the school, the county district or the school themselves would have say as to what is built there. If the school has the lease contract to the property, how would anyone else gain authority to build anything? only the owner or the current leaser would be able to build on the land.

7Rk5aUcvaa	I agree with what you're saying here. The problem with the welfare system is that there aren't set regulations to stop things like this from happening. I understand and support giving people aid and help when they're in a tough spot, but there have got to be rules and more monitoring of people who apply for or recieve welfare benefits. <br>  <br>  Too many people abuse the system because it's easy and they can. As it stands, welfare ENABLES people, it doesn't EMPOWER them. There needs to be certain guidelines to qualify for it, such as being laid-off, fired, falling ill, etc. and they also need to help people get into GED programs and with job placement, not just hand them checks every month.  I know of someone who doesn't work simply because he doesn't feel like it. He has a wife and 4 young children. His wife is disabled and is unable to work, but he is more than able to, he just doesn't. Yet, welfare keeps handing him money every month and NOTHING changes. It's insane and I don't know why people haven't made the system more efficient.|`|Ulff1hcDaa	Do you seriously believe that everyone on any human services program is the same?<br>  <br>  "They" are individuals with individual barriers and individual battles "they" are fighting.<br>  <br>  But I guess it is just easier for you to lump "them" all together and judge "them" as a group?  Right?<br>  <br>  I got food stamps for 3 years.  Why?  Because my young son had cancer and I had to choose between keeping my job and leaving him to die alone in the hospital or being there with him.  No contest.<br>  <br>  Now, many years later, I work in the "welfare" office and I help others fight the battles that life throws at them.  Over 70% of the people on my caseload have jobs.  They simply don't make enough to survive.  In fact, the programs I administer have time limits and work requirements.  There are also those who had jobs until mass lay offs hit my area and then there are those who are elderly and/or disable and simply can not work.<br>  <br>  Apparently you have never needed help.  You should count your blessings instead of judging a group of people and a system that you don't understand.<br>  <br>  But hey, don't let me ruin your fun....you keep on bashing those uppity poor folk.  After all, they do nothing but sit at home eating cheetos and watching tv, right?  Don't let reality burst your bubble!|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	We definitely need GOOD welfare reform. People on welfare should be make to take any job available. You sit on your *** and you get nothing. And it definitely should not be given to pregnant females. You want the baby, you pay for labor/deliver and provide financial support.<br>  One of the biggest mistakes the Feds made was giving welfare to unwed mothers especially when they are on their 3rd, 4 th, or 5th child.<br>  These females are making a career out of having babies.<br>  Others started out with good intentions getting benefits when needed, but became couch potatoes and refused to go back to work (the Gov never forces the issue).<br>  We now, unfortunately, have WAY to many people depending on welfare to support them and their families.

There's bigger fish to fry. Besides, those on welfare need programs to help them get into the workforce again, as their skills maybe lacking, eg apprenticeships/traineeships, basic computer skills classes, etc - you'll find once they're encouraged to learn new things, their motivation will take hold, which is a big part of the issue.

l74RoxUDaa	About 350 years ago, Worcester was in the thick of a pretty nasty siege, making a stand for King Charles when the Parliamentary forces were camped outside.<br>  <br>  These days it's a quiet little place sliding gently into obscurity.  Royal Worcester went bust last year and the pottery has been sold for designer apartments. Elgar's music shop was knocked down in the 1960s and replaced by the Giffard Hotel and Lychgate Shopping Centre, a monument to 1960s brutalism to make a dynamic designer statement to the cathedral opposite.  They prettied it up recently by putting some rather tasty blue LED fairy lights.<br>  <br>  At least Sir Edward has his statue outside where his dad's music shop once was. One day some wags put a traffic cone on his head - the worst thing was that it suited him rather well - made him look like a wizard.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the cricket ground was a sea of mud in the summer of 2007, and fish were flapping around the racecourse.<br>  <br>  So you see, Worcester has its fair share of suffering and can stand proud alongside Gaza!|`|Nkwv2hygaa	I went to school in Worcester, MA. Why not just say they support Hamas?|`|WT7Gub0Xaa	Will the people of worcester now start firing rockets into wales?<br>  Is it any wonder that people are turning to the BNP with idiots like that running local government.<br>  Perhaps there aim is get money from charitable organisations  for bomb making factories in worcester.<br>  Just hope no one gets kidnapped when they visit Worcester|`|X0vqgxohaa	I think that twinning is usually done to give Councillors free junkets abroad and that the majority of residents ignore the subject.<br>  Are the Councillors of Worcester intending to go to Gaza and give their support (at their own expense) or is this just a bit of window dressing.|`|AA12349988	No - but after saying in an earlier question I didn't know who was twinned with my city I looked it up.  <br>  <br>  And I can assure you Nottingham does not look like Harare (Zimbabwe) or Ningbo (China)  I have no idea where Karlsruhe in Germany is nor Timi?oara Ljubljana<br>  <br>  <br>  So maybe its not such a bad idea after all.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	i think it's a good idea. maybe it's the contrast that they are trying to highlight. what criteria would you use.
7CKZpfRiaa	Adam B is obviously confused, and doesn't have reliable sources to back up his answer, nor does he even have the common sense of a conservative.<br>  <br>  On that note, heck, they're borrowing from everybody, burying the country in a massive debt, and still manage to win the vote of the people. Screw this I'm moving to Canada. haha just kidding.|`|k6hicodfaa	No, from ourselves.  After all, we do subsidize red states with our tax money.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Blue states have higher per capita economic output than red states, and pay more in federal taxes than red states.  So there goes the entirety of your argument.|`|vN2PUynoaa	Well I would say yes, when you think about Obama's stimulus is going to take over forty years to pass off. <br>  <br>  Where else is he going to get the money and why would he care... he will be long gone by then.
sMNEooBVaa	I scored a 37 on my practice test. If you are like me (work better in testing enviorment), then you will be fine. I took the real test and scored a 75 (more than double my practice). The real test is easier than the practice in my opinion. Good Luck!|`|tz2qxNPYaa	I beg to differ on your statement that you are good in English... but that withstanding, the test is a lot more than 50 or so questions. All you can do is continue to study and hope for the best. Remember that if you fail to do well, you can always retest 2 more time (after 3 times you are required to wait 6 months). Good luck.|`|FGbAGa1Taa	I know that a lot of people say you will do better on the real test than on the practice one, but that is not how it was for me. <br>  <br>  I got a 58 on my practice test in the recruiter's office about an hour before my real test, and I ended up getting a 47 on the real test.<br>  <br>  I would suggest doing as much studying as you can in the next week!|`|3xTNOevjaa	Passing the score is the easiest thing, but getting it high is the problem. You'll do fine unless your completely bad on tests.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Congrats, you passed.<br>  Evan if you scored 10 points higher on your afqt score it really won't make a difference. The afqt is just a pass/fail overall score. Your other line scores are what comes into play when looking at a job. Besides if you want to retest it's a 30 day wait. Keep in mind too you could also get a lower score and that's the one you keep until the restest 6 months later. Keep what you have and it's been my experience that very few people improve 10-20 points on the afqt score which is not as important as line scores. <br>  <br>  Make sure you take the day test locally and not the night test at the meps hotel. People do better in the mornings. Believe it or not getting a good nights sleep the night before and eating a good breakfast will make a big difference in your score.<br>  Good luck.
