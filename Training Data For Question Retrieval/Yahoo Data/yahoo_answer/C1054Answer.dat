PPnkCUJOaa	al di là di tutto, bisognerebbe essere grati alla famiglia Sensi che ha portato la roma nelle posizioni del calcio che contano...anche se forse è ora che vi sia un ricambio societario!|`|96eblPKMaa	Penso che i Sensi abbiano fatto tanto per la Roma. Hanno portato una squadra che praticamente non vinceva niente ad alti livelli e fra le grandi non solo d'Italia ma di tutta Europa. Hanno operato con pochi soldi (a differenza di altre squadre di cui tutti sanno già),portando nella capitale gicatori che sono partiti da zero e hanno raggiunto altissimi livelli e sono diventati dei campioni. Questa è la filosofia dei Sensi e quindo dell'intera società giallorossa,partire dal piccolo per poi arrivare al grande. Sull'arrivo di Soros? Bè... pensare ad una Roma in formato Chelsea non era un'idea male,anzi. Però da una parte sono felice che i Sensi siano rimasti,per affetto e perchè dentro di me sono convinto che ci sono ancora grandi traguardi da raggiungere insieme. Speriamo bene. Sempre e cmq forza ROMA.|`|t3cQiZEdaa	nn moltissimo, era meglio soros<br>  <br>  <a href="http://albythebest95.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://albythebest95.spaces.live.com/</a>|`|YcGBIyB5aa	io neanche un po, non hanno ancora comprato un sostituto di Mancini e  Giuly.|`|lz6W34C9aa	Per le scarse disponibilità economiche che possono mettere in campo,stanno facendo molto bene,,,e sono molto attaccatti alla squadra,ma così la Roma resterà sempre in questa dimensione,senza fare il salto di qualità verso le grandi di Europa.<br>  <br>  Una cosa che non tollero e mi fa imbestialire .è il fatto che continuino  a cedere giocatori all'Inter,che poi per tutto ringraziamento gli frega pure gli scudetti.|`|xt7qsbLiaa	CERTO...dobbiamo ringraziare a vita sia Franco Sensi k Rossella...x qlk hnn ftt,x qll k stnn facendo e x qll k faranno...e ki dice k nn vinciamo nnt..io dico solo... 2 coppa italia x 2 anni...1 supercoppa aspettando il 24 agosto..3 secondi posti...anke abbastanza rubati,specie l ultimo...e mi sembra k in europa siamo la squadra italiana k è andata + avanti...quindi interisti e laziali dovete solo k tacere...A.S.Roma 1927 smpr e cmq|`|iiSOXTeXaa	non molto...anche se la roma ha avuto sempre buoni piazzamenti in campionato non ha mai fatto una grande campagna acquisti a causa della disponiblità economica dei Sensi...|`|LhRBaGRyaa	dovete essere grati a quel vecchio di sensi xkè vi ha fatto vincere uno scudetto ke x una squadra ke nn vince mai un cazzo è molto<br>   FORZA LAZIO|`|BXXsOpLiaa	di quella di franco sensi si di quella della figlia x niente, tutti gli anni dobbiamo fare i salti mortali x fare il mercato e persino la fiorentina ha + soldi di noi da spendere.|`|Ngi4KPZqaa	la roma e una buona SOCIETA.... ma non vuole mai spendere tanti soldi per i giocatori e cosi non andra da nessuna parte..................|`|9kfY927Haa	non tanto e spero che entro 2 anni ci sia un cambio societario credo che ormai sia arrivata l'ora.|`|qXjKRZWPaa	beh Franco si ma Rosella non capisce un caxxo di calcio<br>  |`|7xw6Ssjdaa	si...hanno ftt tnt x la roma e spero ke continueranno così...!!!!|`|MEkgtNGraa	hanno fatto tutto il possibile per la Roma.

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Ah, as you know, gators aren't out to "get us", not sure of the stats there in Texas, but here in FL, we've had about 25 human fatalities from gators in the past 50 years... dogs kill more people here every year than that... if they were as dangerous as some people think, there would be no people in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, and coastal North and South Carolina. If they were all that dangerous, they'd be breaking into people's houses and stealing babies.<br>  <br>  Other than seeing one come up for air, or seeing it slip into the water, there's really no way to tell unless the water's clear enough to see them. The bubbles and bubble trails you're seeing could be turtles as easily as they could be gators, or, as you mentioned, it could be "swamp gas", or even clams.<br>  <br>  I know your dillemma, but don't get TOO comfortable about paddling with the lizards... every now and then a big male will see a 'yak and all he thinks is "Dammit, there's something long and low on the water... I know it's a funny color, but it MIGHT be a threat to my territory, so I'll go kill it just in case." This happened recently at a local wildlife refuge near where I'm at... luckily the 'yakker wasn't hurt... the yak however... that's a different story.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of reports of gators "attacking" kayaks and canoes, but I think what it really is is that gators feel safer in deeper water... you pass by one on shore, it makes a run for deep water, goes under your 'yak, gives it a bump, scares the bejeebers out of you and both of you go about your business.<br>  <br>  Just keep your eyes peeled, stay away from any areas that people may have been feeding alligators (95% of our attacks here in FL are linked back to feeding), don't feed them, don't tease them, and if one's watching you fish, find somewhere else to fish.|`|6ae2f072d1aa4c5ad3b45f388352d5fbaa	The best way to find gators is to stick you legs in the water and wiggle your toes.  If nothing happens after 15 minutes you should be good.<br>  Just kidding unless you're into that kinda thing.  Watching Steve Irwin look for gators in a swamp, he got up as high as he could and he could see all the creatures.  If this is not practical for you then I would probably go to a safer area, without alligators.  |`|SOFR1dEDaa	If you're seeing bubbles in a steady line dont worry it's not an alligator, theres a lot of things that could be causing it but not an alligator, they dont breath under water they hold their breath. If you're worried about alligators the only ones you have to worry about are the ones on the surface. But alligators and crocodiles are atracted to vibrations so don't be thrashing around a ton because they might come up to see whats going on.|`|CFtNn3yBaa	Steve Irwin is a good example of 'hanging around the food chain'.  There is a reason humans generally stay away from 'croc' infested waters.  We have evolved as a species and survived to this point by having a healthy fear of places that want to eat us.  <br>  <br>  To a gator, your leg is no different than a leg of lamb, wrapped up in cloth.  Your arms are like chicken wings.  Bagging you  =  7 days of not worrying about where food comes from. (Kind of like a Holiday Bonus from his boss; ie: stomach).  <br>  <br>  If it was okay to hang around where gators were, they'd be in our homes as pets and running errands around the office.<br>  <br>  Make peace with your "inner extreme chance taker", undertake more projects that result in contributing to the community and find more harmonious places to paddle.<br>  <br>  T

Mike Vick is dangerously close to not playing another game in his life, plus he never got it done either and has just made the Falcons a mediocre team.

The simple fact of the matter is, black QB's historically have NOT got it done. The only one to ever win a Super Bowl was Doug Williams and he wasn't even a starter. Yes, I think that having 3 black QB's on a team is a disaster, I am not a racist by any means, I am, however, a realist|`|QskEfMb4aa	You are gonna get eaten alive on this question bro. You might want to look into seeing if there is some way you can retract it...<br>  <br>  I was just waiting to see an "N" bomb in your question! Don't pick on minorities at the QB position, and don't ask questions with racial implications...<br>  <br>  I honestly think that African-Americans are superior athletes, especially in Football. They tend to play the skill positions (Receiver, Running Back, etc.) and excel at them. I don't think it necessarily takes a great athlete to play Quarterback. Most African-Americans are not built like a prototypical QB as far as body type. Guys like McNabb, Leftwich, Russell, McNair, Culpepper, and Jason Campbell are exceptions and a very small percentage at their position. Look at QB's like Michael Vick, Vince Young, they are great athletes, but not really that great of QB's as far as throwing the ball and being consistant. Those two could probably play any of the other skill positions and do a lot better. I hope I didn't offend anyone by what I said. I just wanted to state some things that seem pretty obvious to me. I don't know for sure, but maybe their aren't alot of African-Americans that try out for the QB position when they are younger and coming up in the football ranks. Just like anything else in life, when you have a small percentage of something and it doesn't do very well for whatever reason, people will talk about it negatively and I think the topic of "black quarterback" unfortunetly falls into that category.|`|4PLPzFdNaa	Racist Bi**ch black qb's rock...maybe not as good as other ones...but if they made the nfl they are incredible and better than you so shut your mouth.<br>  What about jemarcus russel<br>  Vince Young <br>  Steve McNair<br>  Michael vick<br>  Aaron brooks<br>  Byron Leftwich<br>  Tarvaris jackson<br>  Jay Cambell<br>  dont talk if you dont know anything about football|`|8563088a69341bce6df5638febd883f6aa	C'mon now man.|`|GGZ3SAblaa	I'm with you on this one.

Actually I am not a fan of The Patriots, I am a Steeler fan, so I should really NOT like the pats.  Having said that, they played one hell of a game of football last night.  That game came down to whoever possessed the football last and that's it.  Brady has his superbowl rings, and he played a good game last night.  Peyton manning and the Colts just played the game a little bit better, especially in the second half.<br>  Last nights football game was probably one of the best I have watched all season.

Be careful, you could be hooked for life. lol later rockstar|`|9zPvXhVbaa	It's $39.99 if you choose to watch it at www.wwe.com. If you do watch it there, make sure that you start watching the broadcast before the show actually starts. Otherwise you won't be able to watch it until about 1 1/2 hours or so after it finishes|`|Hg7yVYsmaa	39.99 on payper view, but there are some Taxes about 3 to 5 dollars depends on your service|`|RxXTSkH2aa	34.99 dlls more or less|`|AA10306402	Contact your cable company.  Usually they run about 39.95 plus tax.  wwe.com also has a web broadcast you can order to view on your computer for 39.95  <br>  <br>  Also, bars all over the country including BWW broadcast the pay per views for free. Its called BLAST areas.  A great way to advertise their establishment.

RxXTSkH2aa	An extreme sport (also called action sport, adventure sport, and adventurous sport) is any sport or physical activity with a very high level of danger and often involve speed, height, high level of physical exertion, highly specialized gear or spectacular stunts. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce a adrenaline rush in participants (a misnomer, since often the rush or high obtained is a product of increased levels of dopamine endorphins and serotonin)<br>  <br>  Snowboarding,Skateboarding,Diving ,Surfing|`|bhTPTzMcaa	kayaking|`|f9a62c794700e1f19ccd7f0649c6e421aa	I'm thinking motocross.

920ee10177d2995cd2489558892c2a00aa	I Would Agree With Your Assessment Of "Attitude Era" Wrestling, But I For One, As Well As Yourself I Assume, Prefer To Be Entertained! The Attitude Era Was Undoubtedly The Best Years Of The WWE And Will Most Likely Never Be Duplicated! Did It Have The Best Technical Wrestling, No, But As Eric Bischoff Described It In His Book, "Everybody Wants To Be That Guy Who Can Walk Around His Job And Flip Off Their Boss And On Occasion Beat The Hell Out Of Him" Speaking Of SC Steve Austin Of Course! The WWE Had That Special Connection To Its Fans, The 80's Had A "Larger Than Life" Image, There Was A Certain Amount A Of Disconnect Between The Wrestlers And The Fans, They Couldn't Associate With Them. But The Attitude Era Changed That, Suddenly People Felt Like They Were Family, Like The Superstars Were Just One Of Them! Their Is No Doubt, Like You Said, That The In Ring Action Has Reached An All Time High, It Is Better Now Then It Ever Was! That's Fully Attributable To The Fitness And Athleticism Of Todays Superstars, It Is No Longer Out Of Shape Guys Who Have Nothing But Broad Shoulders, It Has Become An Athletic Display Of Preciseness, A True Art Form! Anyway, I Couldn't Agree With You More, People Here Are Hypocrites, But The Truth Is Entertainment-wise The Attitude Era Is The Best, Wrestling-wise Today is The Best!|`|4oMK7G6Qaa	The attitude era had wrestlers that were very good on the mic such as the rock. I mean, listening to the rock talk, diss up other wrestlers, and use his common catch phrases was better then the actual matches itself. So today the matches are better but there is no one that can really speak good on the mic.|`|AA10396846	During the Attitude Era (1990's) the WWF turned real and was more destructive. It also marked the formation of DX between HBK and HHH. But the WWE practice all the moves they are going to do before they gon on Raw and in WWF they just do the moves they want to do and make it more realistic.|`|RxXTSkH2aa	For me , the Attitude Era was  when RAW is War was happening , meaning that the WWE(WWF) in that time were looking to create more ratings by doing some dangerous stipulations, and creating first ever Hell In A Cell , Buried Alive , Inferno Match , Hardcore Match......<br>  Superstars putting their bodies on the line to create more ratings...........I am sure anyone else will find Attitude era different that what i have said... Just My view<br>  Now in this recent years is only about good role models, gimmicks and one or two dangerous matches..|`|WtZhceDOaa	omg where have you been..i've been trying to tell people this for years...all the back to when i was seven..i'm turning 15 in 8 days ....lol..|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	You think todays wrestling is better then the Attitude Era?  You're obviously smoking crack.|`|2fcfad55502ac06d4c0b54db7447b18aaa	uhhh yea....professional wrestling has mainly been about storylines.....even though I will agree with you in that the 80's and very early 90's had more memorable wrestlers that the Attitude era. Still it is more about storylines.<br>  <br>  BANG! BANG! HAVE A NICE DAY!|`|6fOzihOuaa	i wouldn't say the attitude era sucked, but late 80-early 90s was a thousand times better. many hours of my childhood were spent a foot away from the television. ultimate warrior scared the crap out of me. favorite: randy savage. <br>  <br>  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|`|9zPvXhVbaa	OHH YEEEAAAAA -Randy Savage<br>  <br>  Do not forget one of the greatest to never be put in the position to meet his potential, Arn Anderson. Best Spinebuster ever. Period.|`|AA11282879	the era sucked it's true, but there was more talent there, be it mic or actual wrestling talent, that the entire roster does today. if u ask me early wrestling was the best, back when everything was kayfab and the wwe was not a monopoly|`|AA12260791	okay
MGzKR8otaa	I like MVP, he is one of the best new characters that the WWE has brought in the last few years. Finley and Mr Kennedy being the other two good new guys. Yet they bring in a guy had months of build up on how he was a free agent and going to go to one of the three brands then when he does come to Smackdown! They squash him against Kane and have not used him all that well in any story lines.|`|2mjJzDHkaa	MVP's a punk carlito john cena and Dx are cool|`|35e05891dcc2b81d730923a4a3cd8210aa	I like his music.

After the Inferno match MVP has been very cool.<br>  He is someone I cheer for when I go to a event, everyone else just looks at me|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	I like MVP a lot. He's is very good in the ring, has a great look, is great on the mic and can sell superbly. If they can let him have some more airtime I'm sure he can take it all the way. His promo when he returned to Smackdown after the Inferno Match with Kane was first rate.|`|21ae604731b9eb8ea264cc40f292a9ccaa	no...i don't like him|`|50e6a7c39766b0ff3842a6e0d1128996aa	He looks weird. <br>  He talks weird.<br>  He wrestles weird.<br>  <br>  MVP is weird.|`|6d814f97a77a2521f0cb59a2a778df04aa	yeah hes pretty cool I think|`|AA12225358	i like him.

He wrestled in South Africa as Big John Strongbo and in eastern Canada as Sailor White.<br>  Late in his life Sailor was still active with various St. John's-based wrestling troops: he started "All-Star Wrestling".

XKbJmTdDaa	I would either tack him in on another trade or hold onto him for a little bit.  The Chargers play 2 of the toughest defenses in the first 2 games and Rivers and Jackson may not get off to a great start.  It will therefore make it hard for you to trade him off for someone decent very early.  Look for big things to come from the #1 receiver in one of the leagues top offenses though.  He will start putting up big numbers and then you will be able to trade him for a slumping Tory Holt or Larry Fitzgerald.  But you have to wait.|`|LsjZJVByaa	Terry Glenn.

He's the number two in Dallas now and they're playing a week MIami secondary and Darrell Jackson and the Forty Niner passing offense looked very pittiful week 1 and Branch is overrated with all the WR options in Seattle.  At RB, I would go with Steven Jackson of course playing the mediocre forty-niner defense and 2nd Rb would be WIllis McGahee.  Baltimore loves to pound the ball and they will run all over the terrible Jet Defense. QB has to be Carson Palmer.  He's a starter every week regardless of matchup, look at what he did last week against Baltimore, best D-Fense in football arguably.|`|tEvnq40Jaa	QB Carson Palmer (better match-up this week)<br>  WR C.J. (no-brainer), Holmes(spread offense increases his value), Branch (he is the #1 receiver, look for a nice bounce back week)<br>  RB Jackson (no-brainer, regardless of week 1), Lynch (had a strong opening week, don't like McGahee with all the injuries on the Ravens)|`|XKbJmTdDaa	Play Palmer over Romo.  Did you see what Roelthisbooger did to the Browns?  Carson will eat them alive.<br>  <br>  Play Jackson and Lynch.  Baltimore wouldn't even give Mcgahee any touches at the goalline.  Never start anyone from the Brown's offense.  <br>  <br>  Start Chad for sure.  Branch will be much more involved in the game next week and you shouldn't worry...start him.  Jackson should be your next starter with Crayton close behind.
XS5fR26jaa	Unsure if Leonard is the best without knowing which RBs are available in Free Agency but given that all 3 of your RBs are hurting, I would use Leonard in a pinch.  If Jason Wright is available it wouldn't be a bad pick up since Lewis is hurting and might not play this week.  Also, since Henry could be suspended, check on replacing him with Selvin Young (if available) or the returning Dominic Rhodes.|`|XKbJmTdDaa	Pick up Leonard for sure.  All 3 of your backs have been hurting some and Henry could be lost for the rest of the season at any time.  You may even wan to look into adding Selvin Young to handcuff Henry.|`|f546d68c95b5d742c71891e2bf32425daa	Without knowing who else is available, Leonard is a good RB to pick up.  Henry's going to be out eventually, so you will need a good backup.  <br>  <br>  I don't think Jackson will come back strong.  A groin tear is serious business.

VLS16mVraa	It sucks...yes it does.<br>  <br>  Half of them if not all of them will play through those injuries to be honest. Lewis, McNair, Rolle, Reed, Williams, Clayton, Heap, and possibly Ngata will play through them.<br>  <br>  Its hard to have a beat up team in the NFL when you are considered the best DEF. Every team has injuries throughout the season, I would just be happy that they are all in the beginning of the season and not when its "completely" on the line. They will do fine though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|AA11899537	They should get a good pick in the draft next year. I think their season is shot|`|Kjr9TG3aaa	Yeh, that's a lot of injuries, but only one is doubtful.<br>  <br>  The Bears lost their defensive team leader, Mike Brown, for the season as well as a starting defensive lineman after the first game, so count your blessings i guess.<br>  <br>  Pro Football players have one of the highest pain tolerances in all of sports. Factor in the fact that they have good trainers, and they get shot up with many things, depending on the injury, and bingo they play.
db31437d04de02c61463c1fd0d6601f2aa	Who are your other guards?  If your pretty solid in guards, I suggest that you keep Boozer as there are not a lot of centers in the league outside of Yao, Duncan, Okafor, and Jermaine O'Neal who can give you that kind of production (points) and rebounds at center.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7946413b5c517335c5d46059a0118b10aa	if your lacking at the guard position it is a definite go and if you need more points a definite go if your weak at center without him keep him but I'd take that trade|`|9a448c82f7d9fb8a27fd3ed44a8e46c3aa	Yea take him if you arent in good shape with centers and forwards but if are lacking in a guard position then do it.|`|AA10002246	Well, it's hard to say without knowing the rest of your team.  You can go to basketballmonster.com (below) to analyze the trade and see how much you'll be gaining and losing in each category.<br>  <br>  Giving up Boozer will lose you rebounds and field goal percentage, but getting AI will gain you points, assists, steals and free throw percentage.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Your best bet would be to play either forward position. Because you dont skate well defense will be a tough position as they need to be a bit more mobile and make quicker decisions. Plus if you are learning the finer points of skating you probably arent real good skating backwards, a requirement to be a good D-man. Forwards in rec. hockey arent always the best skaters and given your size and lack of speed you could be a force in front of the net. Learn how to position yourself and practice keeping your stick on the ice as much as possible in front of the net and soon enough you will net an occasional goal. Since you played other sports at the high school and college level you should be able to handle the occasional beating and banging in front of the net (personally that is my favorite part). Work on your skating and practice anywhere you can with someone flipping pucks toward you to get off quick shots and try having someone flip pucks into your feet and learn to use your feet and stick to get the puck towards the net quickly. Good luck....and keep your head up!!!|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	Instead of trying to pick a position you need to just concentrate on learning all the basics first. I think its great that you want to learn hockey because it is a great sport. You need to realize though that it is way more complicated than baseball or football. Practice and try to get good at skating, stopping, shooting, passing, etc. and then worry about picking a position. Goodluck.|`|3eb0a461e420e22db19a78efc306e87caa	BEFORE you start playing any position..become as good as u can at skating..puck handling..etc. Then maybe u will see a difference and be able to play forward..either one requires just as much athleticity..each one has its own purposes|`|BtiidQy5aa	I think the answers that recommend learning the game first are right.  Learn how to skate forward and then backward.  Whether you are a defenseman or not you need to be able to go backwards.  Then learn how to handle the puck.  Learn how to pass the puck and finally how to shoot it.  Don't worry about the slap shot right away either, the wrist shot is more accurate anyway.  If you really want to beat goalies, practice your backhand.  Play a lot of pick up, usually you can play all the positions in pick-up hockey and get a feel for where you are comfortable.<br>  <br>  Most of all, make sure you are having fun.  Too many guys for get they are paying to play instead of the other way around.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you do settle on "D", don't think you can't score, check out the NHL stats and you'll see some great Defensemen who are also tops in scoring.|`|aGbX7hdoaa	I organize a rec hockey team in BC and all new players I usually put at either left or right wing to start.  These positions are the easiest to start out at and the easiest to play positionally.  The centreman usually has to do more skating and has to be strong on skates for the faceoffs.  Defense is tough because the backwards skating is essential and positioning is really important.  The main thing I suggest is to work on skating as much as possible, work on proper positioning, and ask teammates questions to help with your hockey development.  The main thing though is to have fun and try to score.

XKbJmTdDaa	Both Jackson and Cotchery have bad matchups week 1, Bears and Pats respectively.

TE6Ba7Spaa	That actually happened to me but in a different setting.<br>  <br>  I was trying to add/drop players for my fantasy baseball team yesterday and I got that message. What I did was clear my cookies and then restart the computer. I tried again and it worked.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, contact Yahoo! Customer Care. Hope ya can fix it and buy stat tracker!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|XKbJmTdDaa	Contact Yahoo! customer care.
B91r2qkLaa	Start Julius Jones, he is facing a good Miami D but Warrick Dunn is also facing a good D in Jacksonville. I'd say your best bet is Jones comsidering Atlanta's running game sucks! Good luck though!|`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	J. Jones
vMiuvkwdaa	K. Curtis.<br>  <br>  R. Brown is listed as Philly's #1 WR but watching the game last week it seems to be Curtis. Philly/McNabb will light it up in the home opener coming off a B.S. loss|`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	K. Curtis|`|b44f42e86833b7eed016c290e03c1254aa	Def Kevin curtis|`|UXZAJauyaa	K Curtis
YXbuCShvaa	There is absolutely no question that you should start Maurice Jones-Drew. He scored 16 TDs last year on only 244 carries. He is a quick, tough, and explosive back, and Dunn is older, will not carry the ball as much as Drew, and is overall not as great a back as Drew. Dunn has a bad back and just wont rack up nearly as many points as Drew.|`|ff01ac172751cf1def6abbd73a69174daa	jones drew<br>  dunn went thru that back surgery was a non factor last year and is splitting carries with norwood and norwood is gettin the majority of the carries<br>  good luck|`|XKbJmTdDaa	Jones-Drew.  Stay away from Atlanta for now.|`|AA11672822	jones drew ofcourse he is an explosive back... fast and strong...dunn is good but back problems and just doesent seem to be the same anymore
ibhsu1iraa	I'd put in Laurence Maroney, just because Fantasy LOVES running backs and doesn't give the WRs the love that running backs get.<br>  <br>  This week, I'd use Holt or Driver, as Holt is a great WR, but Driver may have a big week.  As for Brown, I don't think he'll have a week like Holt or Driver.  <br>  <br>  Between Driver or Holt, I'd probably say Holt, just because Brett Favre isn't as hot as he gets older.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|XKbJmTdDaa	I would go with Driver over Holt.  Did you see what the Cowboys did to the Giants pass defense on Sunday?  Expect Favre to take advantage of what he learned about their weaknesses watching the film.  <br>  <br>  I would also go with Brown over Maroney.  The Chargers D is much better than the Colts and the Pats won't be able to take advantage of knowing the other team's signals this week.|`|8de61d65e76a7437b56189540e2cca6daa	i have laurence but im sitting him because hes playing the chargers, i would play holt and brown.
XKbJmTdDaa	Go with Petersen because his time is now, while Chester Taylor is out.  The Lions defnse let Lamont Jordan play like he was Barry Sanders last week.|`|AA12138593	peterson- use him as much as you can til he goes down with an injury
peJMG09Baa	I would go with Stallworth cause of Tom Brady's ability to get the ball to all of his recievers.  Branch is good but he let a lot of people down last week, and I don't always trust Hasselback.|`|XKbJmTdDaa	Start Branch.  Holmgren made it a point to say that Branch will get thrown to much more...stating that it was his (holmgren's) fault that he didn't get the ball in week 1.
0XBVbGRKaa	you should make the trade. <br>  i am sorry to say this but your friend does not sound to knowledgeable about fantasy football. portis is a top 5 running back when healthy, Jennings is a solid receiver and your friend wants to trade them away so he can have a better 3rd receiver.........wtf?<br>  <br>  if i were you i would make this trade and then try to steal some more good players from him. if he has a good quarterback try to make a deal. kitna is not consistent and better as a backup as for delhomme he is no fantasy stud.|`|168ef4e6b2fd36b30f594fa9b65c7164aa	do the trade|`|XKbJmTdDaa	It's a good trade.  It is nice that you won't be taking away a starting receiver but you will be adding a starting RB.  (Yes, Portis should start on your team.)
XKbJmTdDaa	I would go with Curtis and Stallworth unless your league rewards points for kick return yards, then I would choose Randel El over Stallworth.  Curtis is playing against a weak Redskin secondary.  The Chargers will pay extra attention to Randy Moss next week and Stallworth will get more catches.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Curtis and Randle El would be my choices.|`|AA11208121	Randle El because Moss is being covered too much therefore leaving R.E. open. Randle El is really hot right now too.
HvyPnKIuaa	You have to start Brees.  You invested a lot into getting him, you have to hope that he does well.  If he doesn't, trade him away.|`|S1jHTjXBaa	start ben he doing so much better|`|XKbJmTdDaa	Go with Brees.  He is a good QB with a good team.  He is now playing his first home game of the season and will do big things in the big easy.  Speaking of big things, big ben is a big poophead and should rot on the waiver wires.  Biases aside, Brees is still the better pick this week and for the rest of the season.|`|7ee90e37ed8e1e5a99baec3f6b19f43aaa	Go with Drew Brees.  Ben will have a tougher week this week and Brees has to get out of the slump at some point.  Potential goes to Brees.|`|JCmYIob4aa	Go with Big Ben. 60 points in the first two weeks and they are home in Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  Frisco can Score points, but they don't necessarily stop them either.|`|p5o3LchTaa	Big Ben is going against and SF D without the MLB should be huge this week.
XKbJmTdDaa	Go with Crayton.  Gonzo has a beat up quarterback throwing to him and his name is Huard...two bad omens.|`|f546d68c95b5d742c71891e2bf32425daa	Gonazales is a TE, right?  Crayton is a WR.<br>  <br>  Why are we even having this question?

5ZkGgZWSaa	I guess it depends on who turns up on the night, are Manly over their poorly tummies :-) can Leeds up their game after a couple of average performances in SL?<br>  IF Manly bring their 'A' game I think they will win & win easily, however Leeds can do a lot of damage in a short space of time & they have more game time under their belts.<br>  My prediction Leeds 12 Manly 26 though this could easily be the other way round.|`|8YBiVlcTaa	leeds 18 manly 10|`|476GFCDZaa	leeds 6 manly 10|`|KRFaLpR3aa	leeds 16 -10 manly<br>  <br>  i think it will be a damn good game.|`|hriNq1q7aa	leeds 13 - manley 12<br>  <br>  drop goal in the last minute - would be great to watch
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	WWE should just release The Boogeyman from his contract as they have done recently with other talent releases.I've never been a fan of his as he's a very limited wrestler with a gimmick that quickly became boring and predictable.WWE should hire a talented technical style wrestler instead like former TNA stars Petey Williams or Sonjay Dutt and activate the Cruiserweights title again.|`|Nmjjqoybaa	You should be a wwe writer<br>  <br>  New name for One Night Stand - Extreme Rules|`|oAjbBLDpaa	The new name is Extreme Rules from what I've heard..<br>  <br>  Good idea and is very much possible seeing as Undertaker's feud with Shawn Michaels is very likely to end at Wrestlemania so he would have no one to feud with espescially since all main eventers are taken in their own feuds (Big Show with Edge by that time, Matt with Jeff) so the draft would be the only way to get a new opponent unless he feuds with a returning Mr. Kennedy, MVP, or Shelton Benjamin.|`|f3AdydqAaa	Night of Extreme is the new PPV.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	releasing him soon as possible|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	The sooner the better, I agree.|`|pH1Qz6lAaa	Good thinking!

J/k<br>  <br>  I prefer the new name of the PPV, It is a lot more easier for kids to understand the concept of the night .. might be a little tricky explaining something like 'One night stand' in it's actual meaning.|`|ZbShx4lLaa	the new ppv night of revenge i agree but instead of a casket match how bout a buried alive match|`|uqIhD61caa	He'll probably get destroyed a by mega monster heel/face. The departure of Boogeyman will probably be the only good thing that happens during thie PG rating era.|`|VlvektSJaa	Thats really cool.

He is one of the best mic worker in wwe alongside HHH and Cena, but y2j's old charactor mixes comedy in his promos which made him outstanding. He is entertaining in his new charactor too because he knows how to get reaction from public. He changed his charactor brilliantly and everyone forgets about the old jericho, this is the sign of a great wrestler that whatever charactor u do , u do it as ur best.|`|LYZMK8tXaa	Chris Jeroicho is the most entertaining superstar right now. He is cutting the best promos and still have the best matches of anyone in wwe.|`|bc5EELGhaa	There is 3 in those people you have said and they are Edge Randy Orton and Christian <br>  But if i had to pick 1 it would be Randy Orton because he is probably the best superstar wwe has ever signed|`|pH1Qz6lAaa	The Undertaker, and Chris Jericho are the best at what they do.<br>  <br>  Taker: Performs his gimmick better than any other wrestler.<br>  <br>  Jericho: Best heel in the business today.|`|UDqMdvESaa	None because the WWE itself isn't that entertaining|`|VS9BECVAaa	Im gonna make  this short and sweet, but mostly right.<br>  as a face-Jeff Hardy.<br>  as a heel-Edge|`|EzazmdpZaa	Jeff Hardy|`|nm16oIc9aa	orton and edge no doubt about it if they left i wouldn't evan watch WWE any more|`|VlvektSJaa	BACK IN EARLY 2000<br>  <br>  Triple H, Y2J & Taker.<br>  <br>  RIGHT NOW<br>  <br>  Randy Orton, Y2J, Edge and sometimes on a full moon the Undertaker.|`|ZbShx4lLaa	1 rey mysterio he is always in good promos and has exicting matches 2tie between edge randy orton and chris jericho                                 3 mr mchmann|`|lSAybMRraa	I like randy orton and he is the best heel.<br>  i hate edge, but he is also an amazing heel|`|OJ7GJ73vaa	you forgot one name and that is Santino Marella!!!!|`|lJ3icYSKaa	Mike Knox|`|h6JiTNJ7aa	rey or y2j|`|BAurzDXtaa	Randy Orton|`|E7TkNO00aa	I think Jeff Hardy is entertaining.

UCPY4AtUaa	I hate FIFA's unwillingness to change the rules to improve the quality of the games.  With so much defensive play, teams play not to lose more than they try to win.  I would like to see:<br>  -relaxation of the off-side rule<br>  -a couple of lbs. of air pressure taken out of the ball to improve accuracy of the strikers and set piece opportunities<br>  <br>  Just doing those 2 things would help the flow of the game and increase goal output considerably.  The numerous offsides b/c of the trap and strikers sailing balls yards off target are my 2 biggest turnoffs about soccer.  <br>  <br>  The third would be players going down like they were shot after receiving a clean check.  When he lays there and they put him on the stretcher, just once I'd like to see someone flip the stretcher and pound the crap out of the little weasel:)|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Love: Seeing a cracking end-to-end game with a few goals, competitive aggression and fair refereeing (quite rare nowadays)<br>  Hate: Fans who can't admit when they're wrong|`|bqvOOUwDaa	Love : my team, my fellow fans, the excitement, the goals, the pace<br>  <br>  Hate : loses, fans with no respect, boring defensive games, Spurs!<br>  <br>  People are giving non-football answers, because when your question comes up on the main board they just read the first part and not the full question, they enjoy just getting the 2 points i think!|`|fpbLkbJzaa	I reserve love and hate for other other things but like the roar of the crowd, the ebb and flow of the match, the speed and artistry - and even the inevitable flops, misses and broken dreams.<br>  Dislikes - cheating, feigned injuries and over-paid prima donnas who sulk and don't pull their weight, betraying both team and supporters.  Also, the yobbish element of some fans for whom football is merely an excuse for creating trouble and ill-feeling - and as you comment, speaking a lot of twaddle.<br>  <br>  And a nice weekend to you too.|`|AA12299134	HATE:  Luton Town.  Like you, fans who know nothing but think they know everything.  Fans abusing players.  Hooligans who smash up people and places for no better reason than their team losing.  Dirty players (ie Michael Essien).  Top 4 clubs getting the benefit of refereeing 'mistakes' (because they pay off the referees).  Sterile and negative tactics (like Watford last season!)<br>  <br>  Matches being postponed.  Teams wasting positive momentum.  Teams going a couple of goals up, then taking their foot off the pedal.  Lazy, overrated players getting lots of praise.  All English fans being branded as hooligans.  Hooliganism being branded as the 'English disease' when other countries (ie Italy, Germany, Greece) are just as bad if not worse than us.  Clubs not bothering with and not respecting competitions (ie weakened teams in the FA and League Cups)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LOVE:  Watford FC, England and Barcelona.  Players with pace who get the ball and RUN at opponents.  Teams going on particular sequences of results (ie Man Utd's run of clean sheets, Watford getting 5 straight wins).  Fans who really know their football, to a nerdish and 'statistical' level (like me).  Players with telepathic skill (Zidane and Bergkamp are particular favourites).  Football trivia questions which get me thinking.<br>  <br>  Teams having eventful and successful seasons (ie Watford getting promoted unexpectedly, Liverpool winning 3 trophies in one season).  Redemptions (Stuart Pearce penalty against Spain, Liverpool clawing back three goals against AC Milan).  English clubs doing well in Europe.  Evergreen players doing well (ie Giggs and Scholes).  Freak goals.  Cohesive passing moves resulting in goals (ie Cambiasso for Argentina against Serbia in 2006 World Cup).  World Cup and European Championship.  Strange results over Christmas and New Year.  Teams transcending and surprising people.  Cup shocks.  Quality football anthems.  Witty chants on the terraces.  Inventive goal celebrations.  Goalmouth scrambles (ie Everton v Blackburn on 1/4/1995).  End-to-end games with many goals (ie Burnley v Watford on 5/4/2003).  Mythology building in football.  Unlikely players becoming unlinkely heroes (ie Andreas Brehme, a defender, scored the match-winning goal in the 1990 World Cup Final).  Goalkeepers scoring goals (who could ever forget Jimmy Glass?)<br>  <br>  <br>  Questions such as this which make me think........|`|OYYYNCyCaa	love being able to watch man utd playing entertaining and attractive football<br>  <br>  <br>  hate being reported for mentioning anything about Liverpool|`|svt6B0I3aa	I love goals and hate referees.|`|AA12147036	Love puppies <br>  Hate standing in line<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restricted-Act.463583" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restr...</a>|`|gnj5Wublaa	Love Everton & hate playacting, as this gives the egg chasing lovers the excuse to call footy a jessies game.|`|rfCGWFNcaa	supporting the Spurs....well,<br>  <br>  love............the help its gives me with me constipation<br>  <br>  <br>  hate............summertime..no footie and everything backs up.....|`|GbyHQQLiaa	I love: the atmosphere, tension and excitement that a great game can create.<br>  <br>  I hate: players diving and cheating e.g. C Ronaldo|`|mP6ox5f3aa	Show me a sportsman and I'll show you a child!|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	Hmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  How tongue in cheek is your Q!!!!

KdcansIyaa	The first guy is a moron that answered this question<br>  <br>  and yes they do. For running a 4-3 they do.<br>  <br>  Lofa Tatupu is a monster. Only better player is Jon Beason and Patrick Willis<br>  <br>  Julian Peterson is a straight demon on the field. Fast and knows where the ball is<br>  <br>  Leroy Hill- Sneaky player who flys under the radar. But a force to be noticed. <br>  <br>  These 3 are more solid than any other group.<br>  <br>  Screw all the steelers fans who are so pressed on James Harrisons nut sack. What these morons dont understand is that all he does is blitz. He is going to be the sack leader if all he does is blitz. Just like Demarcus Ware. Oh and look at harrisons Career.Yeah he had one good year. Lamar Woodley is okay but no where near Tatupu. Foote is no where close to Peterson and whoever else they have is not as good as hill. <br>  <br>  Now the ravens are close. Ray lewis is good, Suggs is a monster, so is scott.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yep Yep- Yeah He had one pick where he stayed in for once. Wow. Oh yeah over his 5 year career he has 28.5 sacks. That comes out to 5.7 sacks a year. Real good if you ask me. Oh and Farrior is better than Tatupu? How many pro bowls does he have? How old is he? What has he done. Dude ur a joke. Tatupu would straight murder Farrior. he plays with such more passion. Oh and Foote sucks and so does Woodley. Peterson and Hill are ten times better. Send julian peterson to blitz everytime and see how many sacks he would have. Oh wait he doesnt and still ends up with sick amounts of sacks. Since coming to Seattle in 2006 he has averaged 8.16 sacks a season and does not blitz nearly as much as Harrison. Oh and he averages 83 tackles a season which is much higher than harrison. Oh and tatupu. Yeah since he started the league he averages 107.25 tackles a season, 6.25 pass def. a season, and 2.25 interceptions. James is such a bum he didnt even start for 4 nfl seasons. And oh yeah he is 34. Tatupu is 26. The steelers are a joke. I would like to see how the steelers would do without their starting qb for 8 games, lose 7 starting wr's for 5 weeks in the start of the season, lose all starting OL, and lose starting DE. Let alone have their corner play with a broken hand, and the other with a broken rib. And yeah seattles starting running back was out for 6 games. We had the most injuries in the nfl. But wait who has the 2 most playoff wins since 2005 behind the patriots?. Oh yeah SEATTLE. SUCK IT STEELERS. Im surprised they didnt call a "blocking foul" on Kurt warner in the superbowl like they did to hasselback. Then they realized how dumb it was and called it back. Oh and that holmes td celebration? No Penality? Kurt warner pass no review? You guys are a dirty team and all u say is that we are haters. No quite the opposite. Your team is full of ignorant fans who run their mouths. You all are such idiots. You say "oh yeah we love joey porter, Plexico burress, antwaan randle el". Then u release them and hate them. You and all the fans are a joke.|`|CrYzalpyaa	Pittsburgh Steelers all the way....<br>  <br>  Come on now... James Harrison and Lamaar Woodley on the outside. James Farrior and Larry Foote in the middle w/ up and coming Lawrence Timmons eventually taking over Footes spot. Best linebackers in the business.<br>  <br>  Harrison & Woodley.... best OLB duo in the league.<br>  <br>  To Mavro....Yea all James Harrison does is blitz.... I mean he was obviously blitzing when he intercepted that pass in the endzone and took it to the house, right?! .... lol<br>  Harrison's been a starter for 2 years now and has had 2 great years. Woodley for a 2nd year man is great and is going to continue to grow, besides I'd take Farrior over Tatupu anyday when it comes to the MLB.<br>  <br>  Wow Mavro... dude your ignorance makes me laugh. Good job spitting out some stats. I like how you point out their stats when they started for Seattle. <br>  So... when Harrison "started" for Pittsburgh he has avg. about 100 tackles, a little over 12 sacks and almost 3 pass def. and almost 7 forced fumbles. Screw Peterson. Farrior since starting for Pitt has 114 tackles and about 6 pass def. and roughly 1 int. For being 34, I'd say that's pretty good, I would take either at the position. How the hell does Woodley suck when for a first year starter in his 2nd year he had 11.5 sacks? He's up and coming man, come on. I'm not high on Foote, I think Timmons will become the starter shortly and I have high hopes for him so I'll give you that on Foote.  It's not the Steelers fault that Seattle can't equip their team with adequate backups to fill the role when needed. Didn't the Steelers supposedly have the worst OL this year? Plus what does a lot of Offensive injuries have to do with the linebackers? Seattle's defense spent more time on the field then any other team in the league and not a single player could come up with 100 tackles or over 6 sacks this season. Oh and let's do some math here.... playoffs wins since 2005... 05' Pitt 3 Sea 2.... 06' Pitt 0 Sea 1.... 07' Pitt 0 Sea 1.... 08' Pitt 2 Sea 0.... What's the total there? Pitt 5 Sea 4... if my math serves me right. Good one there! <br>  That holding call on Hasselback in 05' SB is what totally blew the game for Seattle. *obvious sarcasm* It's ignorant fans like you why we call you haters. Oh and yea I did like Joey Porter... still like him now. Never liked Burress and Randle El tho. But hey to each his own.... stay on your Steeler hating high horse, Seattle's a joke.|`|ProDw5xAaa	Ravens if everybody comes back.

ebWuyizqaa	I like Liriano, Harden, Maine and Smoltz but they are injury risks.  If they are all or mostly healthy your pitching should be very good.  Not thrilled about your 2nd and 3rd OF's listed- not crazy about Konerko either.  Gordon could be a good value if he starts to come around.  Obviously you got some great talent with HRam, Utley, etc.  I'd check around the waivers and free agents for an OF that might have slipped through, or consider making a trade for one.  Good luck this season.|`|iKv3biPHaa	For a 12 team league, you have a REALLY good team.  I don't know what categories you use in your league, but providing that you have the usual, I think you have a great shot at placing in the top 3.   I really cant find many weakness in your lineup.

Freeze  your credit cards in the freezer(in water) so you cannot access. Go to an additiction meeting, get counseling, see a doctor.|`|Sca69Krvaa	Get yourself an account which it is difficult to withdraw from - or at least not instant like a interent only account with no card.<br>  <br>  Then set up a direct deposit from your normal spending account, for a set amount of money to save every pay day.  Have it come out into your  'hard to spend' account on the day you get paid.<br>  <br>  Then make sure your password to the internet 'saving' account is a word that will trigger you to think about if you really want to spend that money.  Like the name of the car you want or the place you want to visit.<br>  <br>  It is also really key to not limit your spending account to such a little amount of money that you are likely to fall off  the wagon. Make it an amount where you can treat yourself a little.<br>  <br>  Other things to do are<br>  1. To not buy intstantly.  Set yourself a rule that if you go shopping and you see something you are dieing to have don't buy it right then. If you need to ask the assistant to put it aside for an hour. Then go have a nice latte then if you're still desperate for it go back.  Time will often fix a craving to buy.<br>  <br>  2. Take up a time consuming hobby.  Shopping is something we often do when bored. If you don't have time to be bored you are less likely to shop.<br>  <br>  3. If you're particularly suscetible to a time of shopping - like Thursday night or Saturday's plan other activities for that day.

Starts off from his beginning point of his career, all the way to seconds before his debut against the Rock's promo at MSG.|`|3I6YUfg0aa	Foley, I read it and it all comes straight from the heart.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	the amy dumas lita books good i know shes a girl but it goes through amazing chapters in her life
FPgygA6Oaa	derby to win 3 1|`|1PFqMZ6Qaa	1-0 Derby, even though Doncaster are good side, they lost at the weekend, so Derby should win 1-0
BRTa5h7iaa	Nadal hasn't been on the scene that long. Older players like Sampras, Forget, and Wilanders watched and even played Federer. They know what he's like in his most dominant stage. Federer has dominated for 3 years. Nadal hasn't been in the spotlight as long. In addition to that, none of the older players have played him. Murray has played both Federer and Nadal but when Murray entered the world's top few, Federer was sliding down and Nadal was climbing up.|`|6KOEbjjJaa	well it is the first time to know that Murray say that i was thinking that no one was believing that Rafa will win hard court grand slam and win Federer in the Final the older players have more experience and they say what every body was thinking i think maybe be Murray or any other player said that because they are actully played against both Nadal and Federer maybe Nadal giving more hard time to beat him than Federer|`|06GX2Bkmaa	I play tennis and am a national ranked junior player. Just like you every older person I know like Matts and sampras want Federer to win. Or sugest that he is going to win.  They probably are going by experience.  Federer is older( just like them! Just kidding) and has more experience to handle bigger matches than Nadal. <br>   <br>   I think the younger guys like Murray, Hewwit and Haas find that Nadal is in better shape and that he will win because of his physical being. But..... all these guys on the tour might say that they want Nadal to win because they dont want to see federer win. Federer would dominate the tour if it wasnt for Nadal.  <br>  <br>    When I compete there is this girl named Brooke Austin. She kicks butt! And I dont want to see her win again!  So maybe that is kinda similar to your question.  Deep Down Sampras and Matts know that Nadal has a good chance to win the auzzie.  That is my opinion.<br>   Thanks for listening.|`|qnbImhmbaa	Because the older players are smarter and wiser.  They know that Nadal will never have the genius of Federer.  He is truly the better player.  Hail King Federer.  Long live the king.
Ar5VHDiBaa	i ask questions on here to get their fans fired up...... and i collect hate mail|`|RJghPceKaa	my avatar|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, I usually just say the Yankees suck, root against them, and watch every pitch when they face each other hoping for a Red Sox HR or for a Yankee to strike out...and leave it at that...<br>  <br>  ...unless someone trashes the Red Sox to no end (like a certain *cough* Boston area football team *cough* that people love to hate...*L*...)<br>  <br>  For the record, though, I do have respect for the Yankees...Hard to disrespect the team with the most WS titles...Obviously saying they suck is just showing Red Sox pride and spirit...No real harm done...Not gonna get physical with a Yankee fan, unless they start it...*L*|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	On May 21, 2001, I put a curse on the Reds that has yet to be broken (although, with Walt Jocketty as their GM, that curse could be lifted or broken within the next couple seasons, but unless I transfer that curse to the team I'm about to mention in the next paragraph, don't expect this to be that season).<br>  <br>  As of June 5, 2008, I began to hate the Rays almost as much as the Reds.  As of December 9, 2008, because of one of Jocketty's genius moves for the Reds, I now hate the Rays even more than the Reds, but even if you include me verbally bashing Bartlett, Crawford, and Shields every chance I get (the three of them are gutless thugs, by the way), I haven't really done much to the Rays... yet.|`|AA10349169	I think saying i'm a "Giants fan" will do it's Justice.<br>  <br>  Or sometimes I hit up some stats<br>  Like when somebody said that the whole Giants team are 'roid users, I did the research, and the Dodgers had more players on the Mitchel report then then Giants.<br>  It is fun using your brain!<br>  <br>  Greta...check out this blog im "working" for, I think you would like it: <a href="http://www.majorleagueblogging.com/author/beatla/" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorleagueblogging.com/autho...</a><br>  Ya, I write for the A's, lol|`|u1T5TQP7aa	i have a hat with a cubs fan peeing on the white sox, i have it in my profile on AIM lol, and whenever i see a white sox fan at school expressing there "love" for them i scream EW!!!|`|c3tADklmaa	Mostly I blame the umps, and pitches where they don't belong. But when it does occur, I usually say, "What the ****, that is a bull**** play!!! I can play better than you crappy ones!!!|`|qivUrJ3Naa	I always say Yankees suck, especially when talking to Yankee fans.  GO SOX.|`|wmYnJd2jaa	I usually try to wrap the negative in a positive. <br>  <br>  For example, I would say "while I have the utmost respect for their history and success, I don't like the Yankees". Or point out players from the team that I respect like Gehrig, Mattingly or Jeter. If I get into a discussion (as opposed to an argument) with a Yankee fan, I might try to needle them with facts like "0 championships THIS millennium", or point out that the Boston Celtics are actually the more successful franchise based on % of seasons ending in a championship, and winning percentage in championships. (Although...I have also been known to simply say "Yankees suck" once in a while)<br>  <br>  I know this sounds sappy, but I always try to remember that as baseball fans we all have a lot more in common than we have differences, regardless of which team we cheer for. I always find that that attitude helps to meet and get to know fans in other cities if I'm visiting.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Well I will admit that sometimes when people tell me they like the Red Sox, I make a face. But that is just if I feel like being annoying lol.<br>  <br>  But seriously, I just express my dislike for Boston by cheering against them. Anytime they play the Yankees I really want to see them lose. Or basically any team that they are playing, I hope they beat Boston. I don’t say they “suck’ or any of that stuff because a) it wouldn’t be true and b) that is just immature and annoying.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I just spout off random words...suck, bites, crybabies, lucky, darn you...a lot of use of the phrase "Are you kidding me???" Followed by my reasoning, "That was a strike!!!" No way!" "They paid off the umps"<br>  <br>  It's unreasonable good times.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	I speak truths, against which there is no defense, merely delusional denials.<br>  <br>  Hardly worth bothering, though.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  My basic rejoinder to declarations of Yankee fandom, however, is "Don't give up hope -- therapy is available!"|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Usually with the word "Suck"<br>  Usually contains swear words<br>  Usually involves a finger (guess which one)<br>  ALWAYS involves the Yankees|`|JTSNljLhaa	by rooting for every team that plays against them<br>  im not the type to say booo they suck just to say they suck<br>  and besides the Yankees and there fans are very cocky thats add the fuel to the fire also|`|l88pj0NUaa	I don't say Yankees suck, their players aren't that bad but I really don't like A-Rod (A-Roid) lol, when I see Yankees fans I don't say anything but I make a face.|`|0b9cf3568acf2a76265a0b5b41ead92faa	Oh yes ... Whenever I see someone wearing a Yankee cap, I give them a cold stare. I stare them down. The reason? It seems like most Yankee fans are just bandwagon.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	As much as I dislike the Red Sox I never say the suck but I bring up that they did go 86 years without a championship & that's it|`|NP6ytPfxaa	I yell and cuss at them and punch them in the face and murder their families sometimes..|`|TCehI17kaa	I just sit back & just & curse when they do something against the yanks.

Their right to an opinion.|`|LilQ6yf8aa	Not only do I root against the Yankees every chance I get, but I also like to research their player stats and history so I can compare them to my team, The Boston Red Sox.<br>  <br>  It always helps to be a knowledgeable fan when you're shitting on someone else's team!|`|HbTC1BBIaa	It usually goes like this.<br>  <br>  Me: So what team do you like?<br>  <br>  Offending Fan: Oh, I like the _____. <br>  <br>  Me: The ____? SERIOUS? Dude, you gotta be kidding me...|`|acaAycEXaa	In Oklahoma, we take Texas Longhorn (Bevo)stickers and hang them upside down on our cars.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	White Sux, i know its not original but it works!!!!|`|AA11565799	It's situational.  As to the Yankees, it's Yankees suck.  There are numerous Yankee players who warrant special attention, such as Damon, "Hey Benedict Arnold, you work for King George now." or "Hey Judas, you get your 52 million pieces of silver."  As to the Colts, it's I hate Indy or I hate Manning if I were at a Colts game, I would yell out "Hey Manning, Is there a commercial you're not in?" or "You were great in that feminine protection commercial Peyton."  As to the Lakers, it's Beat LA or I hate Kobe.  The name "Kobe" chanted derisively can be fun if the Lakers are trailing by a large amount, which has not occurred this year.  <br>  I pity the fans from places like San Diego or Washington where they just don't have someone to hate.|`|JSryPP8faa	They are all my least favorite's when they play my team. It's best to share my disdain and spread the expletive's around. I also vent at my own team's player's on occasion as you all have. You know, taking a called third strike with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth in a tied game, then losing in extra inning's.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	I use lower case letters only when writing their name.  los angeles dodgers.  Refer to them in conversation as the filthy dodgers.  Bag on them in front of their fans any chance I get - especially when in front of the displaced thug raider fans that have become dodger fans.|`|xIfvXy4waa	Omg, a voodoo doll of Jason Varitek, great idea! Jk, I know he's your favorite (and my best friend's)<br>  <br>  I use examples from history, because of that I think I may know more about the Red Sox's past than the Dbacks lol.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I do two things:<br>  1. Cubs suck<br>  2. They haven't won a World Series since 1908.<br>  <br>  Those are the most common.
wrhqkEiMaa	haha yes they do need Crespo or someone like him.  They have many players of his style but they just don't use them.  Messi, Aguerro, and Tevez are too similar in their styles (and shortness :P) and they're just not that efficient and dangerous, they need a target man.  Crespo and Cruz still have a good couple years left in them, then there are the like of Milito, Denis, and Higuain and many many others that have the built, strength and abilities of a poacher.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	oh sorry Adriano ate him:/|`|VpiYSQVnaa	or some extra crespo croutons!!......ok now we're both lame lol
nJ5kceMBaa	I don't think there's a single valid answer to that. The Premier League's elite are the strongest in Europe, by quite a distance it would seem.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	You're talking too early...<br>  <br>  But it doesn't mean it's not true that the EPL is right up there|`|wrhqkEiMaa	Just because three of them won the first leg by scorelines of 1-0 (two of them at home with one winning thanks to a dive and a PK and one with luck away) doesn't mean they're gonna advance.  The games are only half over, all this arrogant talk is gonna come back and bite you EPL fans in the a*s.  It happens all the time :D<br>  <br>  By the way there was absolutely nothing dominating about the performance of any of the English teams, three of them were totally outplayed and one matched.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Because their strongest teams out of big4 are crap... Aston Villa, Tottenham, Everton and Man C now are below average..... right now they maybe have the strongest top4 clubs and even that not by much and that's proven in recent CL matches, but their league is still below La Liga and even Serie A!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: If Liverpool and Man U couldn't what makes you think that Man C would... hehehe... Man C has Robinho and that's IT!!!!|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	My theory (thanks to MJ)<br>  <br>  Man U 1-0 Barca<br>  Derby1-0 Man u<br>  <br>  Derby2-0 Barca<br>  <br>  Even Championship teams would destroy Barca|`|WS8MvKQAaa	I still think the top three leagues are on par and anyone of them can take the trophy home....hell even Bayern Munich might win this after their show of force.|`|9kfmdYXyaa	epl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oNR7il8baa	I probably eat more than him =\ lol ok not really but he's 20 years old let him enjoy food... It's not my fault us hispanics have amazing food|`|p1kmZziVaa	Maybe he was the one that gave birth.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	haha I have a feeling that Stefy is at this moment preparing the untimely demise of Aguirre
OfdupsTlaa	I'm glad the Cubs have finally moved on and are no longer waiting for him and Prior.    Since Wood and Prior have been so injury prone and the Cubs have kept waiting for them we have done little or nothing to bolster our starting rotation   Now with them gone we have acquired Rich Harden, and  were in talks about getting Jake Peavy.   I think it's a good thing he's gone.   I wish him luck with Cleveland and hope it can be a new start for him.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I'm not a Cubs fan (far from it), but for the person that wishes he was still on the team, fear not, you have his clone to take his place. Rich Harden will be your brilliant, but always injured starting pitcher.|`|io3hggzZaa	i like him but he is getting really old and idk how much longer he will be playing.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I'm gonna miss him but i understand them letting him go, he was paid alot of money, alot of years to be hurt...... i wish him the best
mCTmari9aa	1)There was talk about Carpenter closing but it looks like the given up on that idea. Kyle Mcclellan or Chris Perez could be in line. Perez was a closer in the minors and probably is the future closer but cardinals managment think he is still green for the job. Ryan Franklin could be in the mix as well but I take a gamble with Perez.<br>  <br>  2)Difficult to say because if Helton goes down then Atkins moves back from 3rd back to 1st. Right now I see Stewart needing a break. If there is no injuries he will end up with 13 HR's or so with no more than 30 or 40 RBIs. If he gets a break then he might get to the 20 HR mark and he will have a 60 to 80 RBI season.<br>  <br>  3)I honestly think he is next but Kenji could have just had a bad season and could rebound. Remember that the manager of the mariners comes from Japan... so he might give kenji johjima more chances than he deserves. If Clemet doesnt get the gig then he will get almost the same numbers as Stewart but if he starts then he will probably have 15+ HRs and around 50 to 70 RBI's since he is in the mariners.<br>  <br>  4)I like Kevin Frandsen to win it. Burress will probably end up as a backup for the MI spots and Eugenio Velez will probably not make the cut. Thats just my opinion though
aRy2ZvT9aa	IDK about wearing a Waltrip Avatar for a week.. but its Tequila with Lime and Salt. I just wish Mikey wasn't in a Toyota, but I would like to see him win a race.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Until Mikey won his first race, he was the most charming guy in the sport..<br>  Then he got a good ride, he became the most grateful guy in the sport..<br>  Then he won a couple of races, and became the most ungrateful guy in the sport..<br>  I don't think I would do that for him, because he would never do it for me..<br>  Or anyone else, for that matter...|`|zii6IWHoaa	Sure, I would love to see Mikey get a few wins. i still remember him after winning his first race sitting on the tires all by himself because that was also the race were his good friend and owner Earnhardt Sr. died.  Couldn't imagine the emotions going though his head that evening|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	That might happen.  He is running a pretty good engine package this year and doing well with it.

I have no problem in using his number in my avatar<|`|n55igpCUaa	I'm not betting for or against it. If he does, he does. I wanna keep my puppy avatar for now anyway ^^|`|OFFjKX72aa	If Mikey can pull one off then I will.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Nope, sorry.  I have said for quite awhile now that he needs to get out of the car and concentrate on being an owner if that's what he really wants to do.  I am wondering if he did that so he could insure that he had a ride?  He is likable enough but there are far better drivers that do not have a full time ride in the Sprint Cup Series.  If I did some sort of a bet with a Mikey fan (though I don't know any) I would definitely honor it but I just don't see that happening.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I don't like him very much and thats a story for another day.  But I guess I would still be happy to see him win.  It's hard not to pull for the underdogs.  I can't use his number for an avatar.  I would have no clue how to change my avatar!|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Sure why not I'll sport #55, I adore Mikey.

5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Anyone can say whatever they want about this drug or this non drug or he took this or he took that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The bottom line is that A-Rod is probably the best player in the game. With 103 names still out there, all we can do is speculate who took and who didn't but my belief is that a very high percentage of players in the game right now did at some point in thier careers. There are 2 types of people right now: those who will still watch baseball and those who will not. If you still watch baseball (like I will) there is no way that you can discount his skills. Do you have to like himheck no, but regardless of how you feel about him personally; that man can hit a baseball. <br>  <br>  I say he hits over 300, around 50 HR's and about 120-130 RBI's. He is out to prove something to everybody. Does he ever get into the HOF?? Maybe, maybe not but he owned up to his garbage; unlike the current home run king!!|`|9ca8b7d729f1dd36f9ae8ae25a34b9ccaa	Why don't you call Ed McMahon (of Johnny Carson fame) and get him to dig up the mason jar from Hunkel Wagonner's front porch and see if it might have the answer to this "impossible to answer" question....hear now! let me hold the envelope to my forehead and the "Great Swami" says....."a great year"...will you settle for that for the "best answer"???|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	The best in baseball, exactly what, can't say!

As you get better at it, move down to a one hand cartwheel.  As you get good at that, remove the last hand.  The platform will give you a little bit of extra time to rotate, and you always have the option of putting a hand down when it feels off.   Once you've got that down, remove the platform - but try to limit yourself to no more than one hand on level ground as you build up your confidence for the aerial.<br>  <br>  From there it's just practice.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Follow the link.<br>  Good Luck God Bless.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=aerial+tutorial&aq=0&oq=Aerial+tutor" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...</a>|`|JMEGmao1aa	These will help you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wcpbJCweqo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wcpbJCwe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljnHEDqsr9g&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljnHEDqsr...</a>
IEjc4R3Raa	Porta pottis are a great solution to camping with small kids. They are compact, convenient, and easy to use.<br>  <br>  Emptying is simple. There's a screw-cap fitting over an opening. You simply pour the contents out through that opening. Yes, you can use the main waste pipe at your site, or any dump station. Or, if necessary, just empty at home into your toilet.|`|AA11764538	My parents used one when I was little only for middle of the night emergencies.  My dad had the job of emptying it in the parks sewer depot, its a little stinky.  You just unscrew a cap, you should use the chemical toilet stuff to put in it ahead of time. Maybe with little kids use a potty chair and dump it yourself in the toilets.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Ohhh C`mon let them go in the woods, its never to early to learn. Especially if you have a young son, he`ll get a kick out of peeing in the woods.  Obviously if they are extremely young that's one thing but if they are "potti trained" and they can understand when you tell them to walk that way and go behind that tree. Get them their own shovel and have them dig their own cathole.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	we did have one however we normally go camping in areas where there are no campsite. We found lugging it along more of a hindrance. We now just take a sheet put it up between two trees and who ever wants to go goes behind it and takes a shovel if it is more than a pee.<br>  We used to empty ours when we got home and trust me after a week it does smell.<br>  My advise is go outside.
uEMyWOHnaa	Rex, you were drafted at pick 22 of the 2003 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears. I'm not surprised you didn't realize that though since you haven't played like a pro yet.<br>  <br>  The only worrying you have to do about the draft is concerns your replacement. But, if the Bears are smart, they sign a vet and then you get cut.

Don't think for a second that he didn't pay through the nose for it though (not that he can't afford it).  <br>  <br>  The sad reality is that if you are a regular working stiff, you have to settle for the best that your insurance will pay for.  When you make $100 million a year, you have more options.  <br>  <br>  I'd say that if you have knee problems though, you should go see a specialist.  You might find that there are some things they can do to offer you relief.|`|p1zO5bBxaa	He bought new knees|`|Gt8NoO2waa	Good question, maybe because he can afford the best of the best.

r5AMG8g7aa	Many reasons for this. One thing they forget is that street fights/ bar fights are not about killing. They forget that. They are taught to kill. When anyone goes from training to being in a non-lethal fight, they don't realize that what they were taught is not for that. They don't do what they were trained to do. They try to modify it. That is one reason they get stomped. <br>  <br>  As I said there are many reasons. This is only one of them|`|nRBC4E5saa	Man, after you get out of boot camp, you think you can do anything.  Add to that the mental conditioning that the USMC gets and it just makes it worse.  I love these guys, they're my brothers and sisters, but you have to realize that people in the military are still just people.  Take a hothead who was on the football or wrestling team in high school, make him do five-mile runs at 4am for three months while all the time instilling him with an esprit des corps that borders on the fanatic, and you've got a recipe for trouble.  After some tempering at their first duty station, things seem to calm down quite a bit.  You have to realize that booters are still pretty much just high school kids.  It takes them a little while to finish growing up.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	There is military kill or be killed training then there is civilian self defense training.While civilian arts like judo karate and kung fu  can be adapted to the military it is almost impossible to adapt the needs of military to civilian defense without getting your head handed to you or ending up in jail for murder/manslaughter .<br>  <br>  The term martial arts didn't exist in the dictionary until 1972 and was used to described those ancient arts of JAPANESE origin used by the samurai class the bujin or men whose only occupation was war.<br>  Later it was expanded to mean all asian martial arts which is incorrect.None of the masters of the self defense arts were military men but rather were monks and civilians who devised ways of defending against or escaping from an oppressive military with their bare hands or civilian weapons.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	they only really learn battlefield combatives in basic- how to take someone down and stomp their nose, how to gouge someone's eyes and crush their skull, how to remove a sentry with a bayonet etc- and they are told not to use the moves unless they are in battle..it's later on at quantico that they learn MCMAP and start winning barfights.|`|cFMFNVj8aa	Its probably too much testosterone and they probably ****** with the wrong ones, but i've seen guys with absolutely no martial arts training kick some serious @$$|`|F0LgeWs5aa	They spend 12 wks being told "you are a killing machine"|`|SwIOyL0laa	It's Marine training.  They make them think they're a bunch of badasses.  Even the women.  I was in the Army and was in AIT with Navy and Marine types, and they put a woman Marine in our room.  They didn't even give female Marines ANY combat training at the time, only classes in how to iron their uniforms and put on makeup, yet she was always trying to start fights with us WACs.  She tried so hard to live up the hardass Marine stereotype-- put Playgirl centerfolds up on the wall, got falling down drunk every night at the club, etc.  She couldn't even see what an @$$ she made of herself.|`|KUUfGugFaa	well likely hood is they have been given a new found confidence and a little hand to hand training which coupled with alcohol will likely lead to them starting ****. however when they go into battle as i were, they would be alongside veterans and therefore will exercise more discipline.<br>  <br>  I thought the us marines like our royal marines were taught pretty good hand to hand. mcmap n all that?|`|a1dd2358375c2fcd7d415e82ad779f7daa	Martha has it about right. It's not really the training but the mentality that they instill in you during boot camp. They break you down and build you back up mentally and physically. 99.999% of the time we come out thinking we can kick superman's a**. We are made to believe we are the elite and all others are inferior to us. Understand they are molding kids fresh out of HS or young adults. Give it time and they will mature or just get one good butt whooping and realize their fantasyland isn't reality.

AA11369268	NO that would be a joke of a team, star players like T.O. especially are the worst because of all the drama they bring to a team.  Neither of them have won the big game, and if they were on the same team they would play terribly whining about who gets the ball more.  T.O. cant even play on the same team as Jason Witten, who is good, but not randy moss.  Everyone talks about how talented these two recievers are, but until they are able to become teammates and not just players, they will never make a team better.|`|Z0sTB8Maaa	That would be horrible, I think there would be way to much ego on the field.

mwxKnUleaa	I think he will be missed a lot. I mean Marquette has great players that include guys like Matthews, Mcneal, and Hayward, but losing a point guard and a leader in him being a mature senior is going to be tough. I really hope they still play well without him though because they are a very fun team to watch
alDXc0tWaa	It is difficult to put aside the emotion at this time of the year. The fans feel it. The team does, too, but between the joy of signing free agent Stacy Andrews and the sorrow of seeing the beloved Brian Dawkins join Denver, there is a reality check. Where are the Eagles after a flurry of moves on the first weekend of free agency, and what is forthcoming? Let's take a look ...<br>  <br>  Andrews is a player on whom the Eagles are counting on in a big way. The young man is a monster, a physical specimen who has his best football in front of him. Andrews didn't start playing football until he was in college, at Mississippi, so he is a work in progress. That's a good thing for line coach Juan Castillo, who is salivating at the thought of working with a player as nimble, as athletic and as untapped as Andrews. The tests on Andrews' injured right knee proved to be positive, and he will continue to work to get ready for training camp and the regular season.<br>  What we don't know about Andrews is when he will be ready to play. Head coach Andy Reid didn't commit to a timetable, saying only that Andrews is making good progress and that the Eagles' athletic training staff will continue to monitor Andrews. We also don't know where the Eagles plan to play Andrews, although right tackle is a good guess. The Eagles loved what they saw from Andrews at that position when he was a Bengal. In a game against the Giants last year, Andrews limited Justin Tuck to two tackles and zero sacks. Andrews has the width and the quick feet as a former basketball player to get out against the speed rush, and he has the long arms and the strength to beat the bull rush.<br>  <br>  His presence gives the Eagles more options along the offensive line. They still have a question about who plays where, but they have more bodies and more talent to compete. With Stacy Andrews in town, Shawn Andrews sounded in great spirits and said he was ready physically when he spoke via conference call to the Philadelphia media on Saturday. Could Shawn Andrews play next to his brother and line up at right guard? Or could Shawn play left tackle? He said Saturday it is more natural for him to line up on the left side.<br>  <br>  We will see. In the mix is Nick Cole, who is expected to compete for a starting job at the guard spots or at center, and the question with Tra Thomas remains. He is an unrestricted free agent, and there have been no published reports indicating that Thomas is receiving interest on the open market.<br>  <br>  Maybe he comes back to the Eagles, solidifying the left tackle spot. Maybe the Eagles consider Shawn Andrews or left guard Todd Herermans, who played well at left tackle in his rookie season, as candidates to protect Donovan McNabb's blind side this season.<br>  <br>  Stacy Andrews is not here to be a "solid" offensive lineman. He is here to dominate. That is why the Eagles reached out and made him their first target in free agency. Andrews was heavily courted in free agency. He was a top, top pick for many teams. The Eagles won out and now they are looking for big things up front from a big, big young man.<br>  <br>  Cornerback Lito Sheppard was traded to the Jets on Saturday, a deal that on the surface helps everybody. The Jets get a player who they are penciling in as a starter. Sheppard gets a chance to play and prove again that he is an elite cornerback. And the Eagles get two draft picks, reportedly a fifth-round selection this year and a conditional pick next year that starts as a fourth-round pick but one that could escalate to a second-round pick. Sheppard would have to meet certain playing-time requirements, I'm sure, to provide maximum benefit for the Eagles.<br>  Sheppard's 2008 season was a washout, really. He never held out, to his credit, after the Eagles signed Asante Samuel in free agency, but Sheppard didn't do a whole lot on the field, either. He had a big interception in the end zone against Atlanta, but otherwise Sheppard faded from the rotation at cornerback. He was passed by Joselio Hanson on the depth chart, and Hanson was rewarded with a nice pre-free agency contract two weeks ago.<br>  <br>  The extra fifth-round draft pick from the Jets gives the Eagles a whopping 11 draft picks on April 25-26, including two picks in the first round, three picks in the fifth round and two more in the sixth round. What the Eagles will do with those picks is anyone's guess. Expect them to be very active moving up, down, all around for those two days.<br>  <br>  Without Sheppard, the Eagles still have a good situation at cornerback, but they could add more. Samuel and Sheldon Brown are the starters, with Hanson at the third cornerback spot. Second-year man Jack Ikegwuonu is going to get his shot to show what he can do after sitting out his rookie season rehabbing from his pre-draft knee injury, but the Eagles will have to consider some insurance.<br>  <br>  The tough part of the day was finding out, officially, that Dawkins had signed a five-year contract to join the Broncos. There is nothing but love|`|wxXguyK3aa	Is this it?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bountybowl.com/category/spadaro/" rel="nofollow">http://bountybowl.com/category/spadaro/</a>|`|HNE7dJQiaa	maybe later

Its a big one for the Knicks. We have to excite the fans after 7 years of sucking.

If this can be done a possible playoff spot this year can be reserved for the Knicks. And if all of this can be done in just one season a growing process can be accomplished as well as winning over Superstars in this summer's fa class. That would make us perennial contenders for years to come.<br>  <br>  Go! Knicks! Prove everyone wrong cause its due time for the Big Apple to enjoy basketball once more.|`|DNkavhfBaa	GO KNICKS!!!!!

x9UgZbyVaa	There is no comparison. Ramon is captain of chivas and has been in the team for a while. Why not have both. When Morales retires we can have Jimmy Lozano sub him. That would be great.

But that opens up another question. Do I think he will win? He'll definitely try to win. But I think he'll learn from last year at Brazil and play it safe if he has to.

To be pedantic I note the question is phrased in the present tense, who IS the best cricket player in the world, not who WAS the best player?<br>  <br>  It brings to mind a conversation between two umpires, one elderly who umpired in the 1930s and one who had just stood in a West Indies game in the early 80s. Umpires are in a unique position to rate players. They were discussing how the West Indian batsmen such as Viv Richards, Greenidge and Haynes would have fared facing Larwood and Voce bowling short-leg theory, i.e. Bodyline. The younger umpire said he would have asked the bowler to desist because he would have developed repetitive strain injuries is his arms from signalling the 6s!<br>  <br>  If Adam Gilchrist played in the 1950s he would not have placed a squash ball inside his batting gloves as it would have been regarded as "not being in the spirit of the game" if not as perhaps even been called "cheating".<br>  <br>  Sometimes the best player in the game (at present time) is not even playing in Tests -- in the Australian domestic competition this season there are a few batsman who appear that they just need to turn up to score big hundreds but will not be considered for Test honours as it would mean giving someone like Ricky Ponting or Michael Clarke the flick which wouldn't happen because they are a protected species. These State players are not batsmen facing second-string bowling attacks, they are playing against bowlers who would be walk-up starts in any other Test team other than Australia (and maybe South Africa AT PRESENT). How many great players are stuck playing domestic competitions all over the world because the present Test encumbents are loath to be dropped by national selectors who would be shown the door if they made a decision that turned around and bit them on the ****? Don Bradman was dropped after his first Test!!|`|g5ugbabAaa	Imran zazir, <br>  <br>  go look here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nahmantv.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nahmantv.blogspot.com</a>|`|fb8803755ce47cb985229a932daef544aa	Batsman - Brian Lara <br>  Bowler - Shane Warne<br>  AllRounder - Jacques Kallis<br>  Captain - Imran Khan|`|9EmR4cWBaa	FOR ME THAT IS MYSELF ONLY|`|2xlCj4utaa	evryone in the south african team|`|evEJxv06aa	sachin tendulkar he is the best.|`|AA11088802	sachin|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	The world's current best...<br>  <br>  Batsmen are G.Smith, Ponting and Sachin<br>  <br>  Pace bowler is Steyn<br>  <br>  Spin bowlers are Murali and Vettori (Mendis hasn't been around long enough yet to be considered better tahn these two)<br>  <br>  <br>  But the best ever is undoubtedly Sir Donald Bradman.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	All cricket commentators.|`|nwZD5mzRaa	For me, it's Sachin Tendulkar.|`|yeb7fyHsaa	In my opinion..MY FAVORITE...is Gautam Gambhir. but thats just MY opinion|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	There are different categories to judge a good player. <br>  Best test batsman- Chanderpaul<br>  <br>  Best test bowler- steyn<br>  <br>  best test allrounder- daniel vettori<br>  =======<br>  best ODI batsman- pointing<br>  <br>  best ODI bowler- mitchell johnson<br>  <br>  best ODI allrounder- shakib ul hasan|`|SbbpfaG7aa	Stephen Fleming， great captain，never cheated like Ponting and never brags about small matters like Gavaskar。 Great sportsman and a respectable cricketer。|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Muthiah Muralitaran................................<br>  <br>  cheers~|`|mJOTOGuwaa	Karkin Kaneenan|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	me me me ..........|`|QJlPNgZBaa	kumar sangakkara|`|hVCiSk4Raa	Younis Khan|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	On current form, Graeme Smith.

Get yourself a hardtail mountain bike or a hybrid. The hybrid may be more comfortable for mixed urban. Try both out and then decided. Price should be under $350 with tax.<br>  <br>  If that's too much, just go with the box store bike. Won't have much invested, so when it falls apart, not much lost. You can probably fix most problems yourself during the first few months. After that, the bike shop might be willing to work on it.<br>  <br>  My son has a Schwinn hybrid from WM that's held up fine considering what he paid for it.|`|p2uNE0FSaa	Since you have internet access, I recommend going on craigslist (type the word into your favorite search engine), then going into the bikes, then typing in 'Schwinn.'  Then find the Schwinn that most likely fits your needs, most likely an old 3 speed or 5 speed.  Don't get a Schwinn made after 1982, when the manufacturing was sent overseas.  The name badge should say 'Chicago' underneath the Schwinn.  The Chicago made Schwinns are pretty much bombproof, especially the Varsity.  Although for commuting, you should probably get a 3-speed or 5-speed Collegiate. Schwinns have indestructable frames and nearly indestructable rims. For $100 or less, you can have a fine riding bike, one that is not exotic, but reliable.  Do a lot of comparisons, the are millions of good old Schwinns out there. One thing: Don't buy a low-end department store bike, they are junk and the rims and cranks will not survive your local roads.|`|jvHUsl3uaa	I think you should get a mountain bike. They're very good with those conditions that you wrote. It depends how much your will to pay. I got mine that's about $75 and it is a beauty! I only need small repairs over the last 2 1/2 years. I think you can still get a good one around $50 if you can find one (knowing th economy).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|81d1878d304b3dc1a8e455b4341b7a24aa	Get a mongoose bike. I bought mine from walmart. If you need parts they are in usa, so don't worry about parts from china.<br>  Its runs pretty smooth for a cheap bike.<br>  <br>  It cost me $108|`|mJFgCvYlaa	I agree with McG's answer, if you have Performance shop where you live, then those bikes are decent while not breaking down or breaking your bank. Bike shops also guarantees the bike fits you, and can give you pointers how to ride, where to ride, etc.<br>  <br>  Once you're back on driving, if you want to sell your bike, you'll get to resell the decent bike shop bikes a lot easier, and be able to sell on craigslist instead of getting a few dollars at the pawn shop with a wal-mart bike.<br>  <br>  BTW, almost all of the parts of all bikes are either from China, Taiwan, or Japan. Only the brands of some are American, but any case you won't have any issue finding parts here.<br>  <br>  But, I do hope the cycling sticks with you. I've lost a lot of weight commuting to work and saved some cash when the gas price was sky high, not to mention I really enjoy it.

8eaNfLEOaa	Holt is not a good play this year.  He is the only productive WR on the St. Louis roster, and because of that, he gets double teamed all day long.  He has only put up about 6 pts. each game.  And those stats are padded because of one fluke touchdown he caught against NYG in Week 2.<br>  <br>  With the bye weeks coming up, I understand you need WR depth, but your best option would be to grab it off of waivers.  I am so confident you can get a better WR off of waivers because that is how bad I expect Holt to be this year.  He is a great WR, but opposing teams are smart enough to shut down the Rams best player.<br>  <br>    You have a solid starting line up.  I love Housh & Cotchery and Royal has been a pleasant surprise thus far.  They should be fine to pull you from Week 10-17.  Now what I suggest you do is take the hit and find a less dazzling guy on waivers to fill the void in upcoming weeks.<br>  <br>  You have great depth and RB, but I am very low on Jon Stewart.  He is still in a timeshare with DeAngelo Williams, and for the most part he is only getting goalline carries.  Although this adds up to the ocassional explosion, I prefer consistency.  In upcoming weeks, McGahee will give you that as he recovers from arthoscopic knee surgery.  <br>  <br>  Le Ron M'Clain (idk how to spell it, this guy needs a new name) will not be the starter come years end.  The only reason he got carries last week was b/c they were playing with a solid lead and they didn't want to risk losing their prime RB - Willis McGahee.<br>  <br>  Is this enough to convince you to stick with McGahee?<br>  |`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	yes. get rid of mcgahee.|`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	McGahee had only one less touch than McClain last week.  Ray Rice was the one who lost out when McGahee returned & there's no reason to think that McGahee won't get at least 10-15 touches a week from now on, IMHO.<br>  <br>  Don't trade for Holt.  Having the #1 WR on a team that can't score won't help you.  See if there's some WR depth on the waiver wire.|`|V35ScJzmaa	holt is a great Receiver, but he's the only good Receiver in saint louis, so he always double teamed, plus marc bulger, the quarterback that holt been playing with for years now, is being benched for Trent Green, so my answer is, "NO!", Holt wont help u much...anyway u got the Housh man!|`|2ZCrmQXjaa	Yes I would do that. You would never play McGahee anyhow. Hint: if McClain is available in your league pick him up now cause he will end up being the starter before the year is over. He is already taking 50-60% of the carries away from him including all goaline.
AA11467629	work your turns. drop low & synch your hips. slow turns will fail your test. also - run straight. don't round your turns when you hit the line, it takes too many steps. prep tips - don't stress. run until you puke. good luck, you're gonna need it.
mJFgCvYlaa	If you raise your budget to $300, you can start finding decent bike shop bikes. Go to your local stores and find out what you like, not department stores.<br>  <br>  You can either get mountain bikes, or even some cruiser bikes if you're not going to some rough trails. Gravel trails are ok for cruiser bikes. <br>  <br>  Here are some bikes just to give you an idea.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Never buy a bike from Walmart or any department store and you wont get anything decent for $200 unless it's used.  You really need to go to a bike shop and get something that will last and wont give you problems.

uUDHEFrSaa	Hello,<br>  This is Chairman Jack Riot, i understand that you are new to Y!A and you have a small independant E-fed, of course you would like to skyrocket to the top; But things just don't happen like that.<br>  <br>  Six months ago, GPWF began as a small, weak and unpopular promotion and slowly in about two months it started getting much better, so it decided to enlist help with two other small promotions: KWE (Defunct) and EWE (Betrayal) but its all not that easy, most young E-Feds die before they can even get their name recognised; so GPWF has decided to start helping those who want it badly! if you want it then now is the time to grasp it! GPWF will promote you, train you and even feud with you! I want nothing in return, just another promotion to help! Remember Grand Prix Wrestling Federation will help!<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  <br>  The match starts with Undertaker in control, but Randy finds a way to weave thru 'Taker and nail a Last Ride! so Undertaker starts punishing Randy Brutally, and Randy starts bleeding from the side of his head! Undertaker then picks Randy up for a second Last Ride to outside the ring. but Sneaky Randy turns it into an RKO, then Randy whips 'Taker to near the coffin, and Randy Seems to have Undertaker out, but Randy wants Undertaker to suffer, so he drags Taker out of the coffin and tries to slice Taker with another RKO, but Crafty taker moves and twists..... OMG HELLS GATE!!!!!! Randy is brutally choked until he has passed out, the Taker gets out of the hold, picks andy up and finishes him with a Tombstone into the coffin!!!!!|`|nm16oIc9aa	undertaker chokeslams orton into the casket he goes to close it then from out of no where dibiase whacks undertaker on the back of the head with a steel chair undertaker gets knocked out rhodes pulls orton out of the casket orton regains consciousness then orton lines undertaker up and runs and punts him in the face then orton orders dibiase and rhodes to chuck taker in the casket they throw him in it orton pulls the fingers at him and closes the casket WOOOT
LIKkt8djaa	Honestly I'd avoid those big retail stores. They only sell crap, Sure it'll be cheap and I guess if the person you're buying it for doesn't ride very much then it's fine. But if you're looking for quality then look for a board shop, They'll sell the quality gear, and usually around the end of the season they'll have their 50% off sale on the gear they couldn't sell that year.|`|jTaW3goeaa	In terms of the board, bindings, and boots local snowboard stores or the stores at your local resort are good places.  For clothing, I generally buy mine online because the selection is the best, but I have seen SOME good stuff at D I C K S Sporting Goods however it sometimes takes them a while to get the newest products in.  I was in the Under Armour Outlet Store a few weeks ago and their selection was crap so I'd just buy clothing right off Underarmour.com and buy all the equipment at a local store or off dogfunk.com, there's some good deals on there and they process orders fast|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Go here and compare prices<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.atticskateshop.com/boards.h..." rel="nofollow">http://store.atticskateshop.com/boards.h...</a><br>  <br>  Email them and let them know what your intentions are.

LIKkt8djaa	Nah you should be fine with a 25.8 waist width, As long as you don't ride with youre binding angles at 0... Which pretty much nobody does.

EjClkCfiaa	Loosen your goggle strap!|`|ug0TFgD7aa	after every training..or probably in a break time...go to the pool and let your leave your face in the sun for like 5 mns.every time you swim so your skin color would be equal....|`|W4LGDVsIaa	I don't know how to get the lines to go away, other than maybe using some make-up.  But you might want to loosen your goggles or get some new goggles that don't bruise.  That shouldn't happen!  <br>  Check out the speedo vanquisher goggles.  They are my favorite and hold up even when you swim that much!  They aren't too pricey either, you can get them online for about $15 or in stores for $20 or so.

4HXRmTVvaa	if you have a marathon sports in your neighborhood, definitely go there. they watch you run and walk to personally fit you for the perfect shoe. it's important to get the right shoe, definitely worth the money. without the right shoes, you could injure yourself. your shoes support your feet, and without the right support your legs could be aligned incorrectly, injuring your back and bottom. <br>  I love asics, they are great. go to <a href="http://www.marathonsports.com/products/13/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marathonsports.com/products/1...</a> and browse some running shoes. I believe they give you a brief description of the shoe. <br>  enjoy running!! :)|`|QPmrzqXCaa	Just simply vist www,eastbay.com.  At the top click the Track & Field Tab then select the distance you run and thier are shoes for all prices.|`|03cd2cabce09b78f770b77ffed4d9269aa	Kohl's has some pretty good asics from $49.99 to $59.99<br>  asics are really good running shoes,i totally recommend them for anyone that's running. They also have track spikes at Dick's Sporting Goods and Finish Line.

j62rw4SCaa	i would.  hes on two out of the four of my teams and has done me good
mvu0yrF8aa	nope sorry|`|FEQMb7wIaa	Consider this. Both Parker and Fargas are out with injuries. Fargas has a decent chance of returning for Week 6, but he suffered a groin injury; a fairly serious injury for a RB. With Run DMC still fighting a turf toe and Michael Bush being inconsistent, look for Fargas to get the bulk of the carries vs NO.<br>  <br>  Parker is a top RB, but will be out for at least another 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Right now, Slaton is the #1 back in Houston. He put up great numbers against a stingy TEN defense, and bowled over IND for 90+ yds and 2 scores. I'd keep Slaton for now.|`|f1ZExcKeaa	I don't like it. Slaton is becoming a fantasy beast. Fargas is coming off injury and will probably split carries with McFadden. Parker is hurt. <br>  <br>  Who are your other RBs? Do you have the ammo at RB to wait for Parker to get back?
1aa2a11a44e4315bc16465f054b8f6b2aa	Mcgahee against INY D because w/o Bob Sanders the Colts get run over.<br>  <br>  MJD because DEN gives up big yardage to quick backs (Sproles Bush and Larry Johnson so far this year)<br>  <br>  Don't pick Grant because "he is due".  How many weeks would you wait for him to "be due"?<br>  <br>  Young is getting anything with 10 carries a game and a huge pass offense.|`|6rFWxMFoaa	Definitely Maurice Jones-Drew. He is a must starter every week. Lately, Fred Taylor has been taking the majority of the carries, however this week against the weak Denver Broncos defense, there ought to be plenty of carries to share.<br>  <br>  Ryan Grant is your other starter. He has had a slow start, but against the Falcons last week he showed a fraction of his fantasy value. This week, he's playing the 24th ranked rush defense in the NFL, the Seattle Seahawks. he ought to really break out of that bubble this week. Give him a shot for sure.<br>  <br>  Willis McGahee is not your starter. Here's why: He is not getting all the carries for one thing. He is sharing with Le'Ron McClain who has taken over the goal line carries. McGahee will not get in the end zone very often, but will get some yards. He never does terrible, but never very well either. Don't play him this week.<br>  <br>  Selvin Young is definitely not your starter. Here's why: For one thing, he may not even play this week due to a screwed up groin. Somehow it started acting up last week. Honestly, I don't even think you should keep him. He has sucked this year fantasy wise, and he is sharing carries with both Michael Pittman and Andre Hall. He is beginning to get a few more carries than those two, however Pittman still gets all the goal line carries and scores, and Andre Hall getting a few carries every now and then as well.<br>  <br>  Go with Jones-Drew and Grant|`|HRB7ahSDaa	Short Answer: McGahee & Young<br>  <br>  Jones-Drew will split carry's once again.<br>  Grant and the packers will continue to pass.<br>  McGahee will have the game of the century.<br>  Young and the broncos will run all over Jags.   |`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Young is injured  I would start Grant(he is due for a breakout game) and Jones-Drew( I think they will run alot in this weeks game) 
dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	With broken ribs, I'm more than confident that Westbrook will be out.<br>  <br>  So go with Turner and Jones.<br>  <br>  But...You might want to check the waiver wire for Buckhalter, Westbrook's backup because he might have a good game.  Better than Jones anyways...|`|3c7aaf392fc982a3cb1da7177ed9fd80aa	My philosophy is to choose quality over matchups. What I mean is that a good player is going to do well regardless of who he plays.<br>  <br>  If you have a QB like Manning and he's going up against the worst DEF in the league, is he better than McNabb vs the Cowboys? If Manning gets way ahead, why would the Colts keep passing? But in McNabb's earlier matchup with the Cowboys it was a close game, so they kept throwing.<br>  <br>  Turner is the better RB and Jones has the better matchup. I would go with Turner because he is quality. That's the safer bet.<br>  <br>  I only play matchups when the players are of equal talent. It's a pretty good philosophy because I never have those weeks where I leave a ton of points on the bench or kick myself afterward. Believe me, if your crappy RB has a huge game, you're not going to feel bad because you'd have to be a mind-reader to know.<br>  <br>  If Favre is throwing the ball all over the place, will Jones even play? Maybe Chatman will get more work. The quality of the back is less and the matchup is worse.|`|1aa2a11a44e4315bc16465f054b8f6b2aa	Bench him regardless this week (last week he started, got a 1st qtr TD and then nothing rest of the way cuz of the ribs)  6-9 points isn't Westbrook production in Fantasy and his Ribs will really bother him after taking a shot or two from Willis of SF.<br>  <br>  I think the NYJ will hit the air in Cincy and Jones will get about the same production as Westbrook...Jones is the safe pick with the matchup.<br>  <br>  If you look good at WR and QB with matchups then go with Turner cuz he can get you that big game if he breaks a 60 yarder.  He is a threat every time he touches it and ATL will be in this game all day so he will get 20+ carries no matter what and that will guarantee decent numbers.|`|Dl88v1Tvaa	Micheal Turner he has the most points of them 2 and is likely to score more points.|`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Jones and Turner.  Westbrook is out.|`|4aErvgVVaa	Thomas Jones has a great match up against Cinci, so I'd go there. He'll run all over them.
3c7aaf392fc982a3cb1da7177ed9fd80aa	Well, it depends who your backups are, but I would also point out that MJD goes as the Jags go. Currently, they're pretty bad and they have a lot of injuries. If you think the Jags will get healthy and their O-line can gel, do it.<br>  <br>  I took MJD in every league and I would not trade him, nor would I have dropped him for Slaton. RBs on bad teams have incredible weeks. Incredibly good or incredibly bad.<br>  <br>  Cooley is enigmatic to me because Washington is much better this year, and they're better because they're not using him as much for big plays. I think he's a bit of a crutch for the offense and funneling it through him is probably not good as he is not a huge playmaker due to his physical limitations.<br>  <br>  The Chargers are relying more on the pass and less on the run. Gates is in there in the red zone. Even LT is not in there on every play. Teams are covering Gates fairly well, but I think Rivers is out of the bottle and he ain't going back in. Chambers is a bit like Gates, so he's that tall, physical guy downfield or at the corner of the end zone, but it doesn't mean Gates is done.<br>  <br>  I think that using Cooley is like the Lions getting 150 yards receiving to Shaun McDonald. If it's gotten to the point where the offense goes through that dude, you're in trouble. Not that he's a bad WR - he isn't. But he's not the guy to break plays, he's like the 3rd read at best. Cooley is the same way. He isn't going to get deep. He isn't going to break yards after the catch. If he is getting used enough for you to be getting points off of him the Redskins are going to be losing, and right now they aren't. <br>  <br>  They're running better with Portis. Cooley is still a big part of what they do, but Moss is now more of a part and Randle El is finally doing something. I think Cooley is going to be key for those 3rd and 6 situations where they throw a quick out or a screen and he gets a first down. You'll never get HUGE points from him, but 5 points a game is ok. Gates could get you twice that, easily.|`|hVjxNhJWaa	NO, not a good trade|`|HRB7ahSDaa	Short Answer: No.<br>  <br>  Cooley is having a hell of a year. Gates not so hot. Slayton is doing decent, while Maurice is doing decent also. In my opinion, No it its not a good trade for you.|`|1aa2a11a44e4315bc16465f054b8f6b2aa	Not this year...Slaton will get better and better and MJD will continue to split carries.  Cooley is big-time favorite target in WASH and Gates is hurting....begininng of year I would say jump all over it but I don't see anything changing to go back to that.|`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Gates is gimpy this year, Cooley is starting to get hot, so no to this trade. |`|ozPluaskaa	Ya i would jones-drew and gates are way better!!
rcgr8oJdaa	i would go with Warner, they love to pass and pass a lot in Arizona.  Terrance Newman is out for the Cowboys.  Plus they are playing in Arizona so you wont have to worry about any weather issues, 75 degrees and sunny+down 14 plus points=nice fantasy day for Warner.  And Warner did almost retire but that doesnt mean anything, he will finish the year out and the Cards will win the NFC west|`|6rFWxMFoaa	Go with Warner. The Jets will be running a lot.|`|1d11ce6aa19819be182bac6a298da6a3aa	Tough Call. Both have good pass d's. I think you go with Favre at home. Warner almost retired last week because he couldnt get over Boldin|`|grmb5YuQaa	Favre because the bengals are some trash and dallas might get some picks on warner |`|hPkZreqXaa	Warner. I'm a Cowboy fan, but we give up a lot of passing yards and Arizona likes to pass. |`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Warner, this will be a shoot out.
TB5I4Wa5aa	I would much rater have Clinton Portis, Brian Westbrook, and Earnest Graham then Brian Westbrook, Chris Johnson, and Steve Slaton. Brian Westbrook it fighting the injury bug right now, so it really comes down to, Would your rather have Portis and Graham, or Slation and Johnson. Slaton and Johnson are two great athletes the are more speed oriented. But I like the power running game so that's why I would take Portis and Graham.|`|0QWfdxrfaa	Portis, Westbrook, and Graham<br>  <br>  C. Johnson is going against arguably the best rush defence in teh league(vikings) so he is out of the question.<br>  Westbrook will be good no matter who he plays.<br>  Portis is the workhorse of the redskins and is a guarentee for good points.<br>  |`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Portis, Westbrook and Graham.  Portis is having a great year and once Westbrook heals after his bye week, he should be good to go for the rest of the year.|`|0ffSW934aa	So you're pretty much comparing Portis and Graham to Johnson and Slaton. Portis is one of the best backs in the league. He gets almost all the carries, and is a lock for at least one TD a game. Slaton is an up and coming star, but you never know with him. The other two, Graham and Johnson split carries. The proble with Johnson though is he may get more carries than Lendal White, but White  gets all the Touchdowns. I think Portis and Graham are much better RB's
UdtzY5ciaa	Palmer.  Jets defense has been horribly passive this year.  Thank god we're scoring a lot because our defense ain't stopping anyone.|`|Yhj82wl4aa	I'm gonna go against the grain here and say Orton.  His production has been, although surprising, rather consistent lately.  And Carson's production has been consistently unimpressive.  Guys like Orton and Ferotte are putting up good numbers cause teams have to focus so much on the likes of Peterson and Forte.  Cin has no run game and defenses around the league know it.  Until Benson emerges as real threat, which I think he will, and Palmer stops missing practices I don't think he's as a solid of a play as Orton.  Best of luck.|`|4H3zT1dsaa	Palmer.|`|qDBeG26Saa	I guess Orton but to be on the safe side palmer because he is more consistent.|`|7JEWBeEjaa	Palmer, i believe he'll give you more production than Orton this week|`|YS4B1Stlaa	orton|`|0ffSW934aa	START PALMER. Orton has been doing good the past few weeks, but it is still Kyle Orton. Palmer looks baack to form. If Palmer doesn't get more points the Orton this week I will kill my cat. You here that Fluffles! That's right.|`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Palmer|`|2OQz9NLWaa	Palmer.  Jets pass defense isn't all that great.|`|Rq43axYGaa	PALMER FOR SURE!!!|`|PcY1ZgRhaa	orton atl has no defense<br>  
15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	I'd do it! You have good RB depth already. So trading away a bit of that for a position that your team really needs (WR3) is a no brainer. DO IT!!|`|teSCVfRoaa	What are you waiting for, just do it!|`|pSQVstWKaa	I am iffy on that trade because Marques Colston has other wide outs with him and drew brees share the ball with all. Kance moore gets a good amount of the ball as well does devery henderson and robert meachem. I think for the three players you giving up you can get a better wideout
FiLchdiSaa	Honestly I like Dominic Rhodes going into GB. He'll be getting all the carries this game, and should do better in breaking through GB than Baltimore. Your whole team is gonna have an awesome week. Andre Johnson is back, baby!|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	Berrian all the way. He's coming off back to back games where he's been targeted often and has got great stats. He and Ferrote are clicking, use him now! <br>  <br>  Pittman is getting good carries now, but NE rush defense is still pretty good, look for Cutler to beat them through the air this week.<br>  <br>  Rhodes is an alright option, I just question if he's ready to handle the full load after being an after thought for so many years.|`|teSCVfRoaa	I like Rhodes, Berrian, then Pittman|`|K26unMoqaa	Well to me that's simple, it comes down to Pittman and Berrian. Chicago has given up the most passing yards to wide receievers this season in the NFL. And they may be without their best cover guy Charles Tillman this weekend. To me, it's like this, either Berrian will light them up if Tillman does not play, but if he does Chicago may blanket Berrian with someone over the top in a way just to say hey Bernard you're not gonns come back here and try to prove to us that we should have re-signed you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now provideing the fact that Pittman starts again, I love his matchup. Denver will move the ball on the Patriots and Pittman gets all the red zone work on that team at the RB position regardless if he starts or not.  Just my take|`|edWSQSW9aa	Michael Pittman (Getting more carries vs weakening NE DEF
15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	Your WR's are fine at this point. I would pick up Rhodes and use him while he's getting touches, then just dump him when Addai comes back.|`|teSCVfRoaa	by the time you read this Rhodes is gone, next! Why drop anyone?

Not heavy enough to be a prop realistically if you have serious ambitions.|`|H5Jrd0siaa	Also look at Flanker. Similar to No8 to a point. You need to be quick over short areas and strong upper body.|`|rOv1wowLaa	most people would say prop, flanker, 8 man or lock but another good position would be inside center|`|rUD8EM67aa	Front row, prop.
r5AMG8g7aa	You can do most any martial arts you choose, I am nearly 55 and have more than normal problems due to my age and injuries. I still train.  I have had many students begin their training with me that were in the 50's. not a problem. Just know your limitations, You may progress a little slower than the younger guys, but that is normal. If you have medical limitations discuss them with your instructor before you begin.<br>  <br>   Be sure that you find a good instructor. Stay away from any schools that tries to sell you a black belt contract. If they talk about becoming a black belt, run. A good instructor will never tell anyone how long it takes to become a black belt. That is because everyone is not black belt material. It is also not based on time or attendance. <br>  <br>  Styles are not important. The instructor is the most important factor.

An instructor can make modifications to the martial art to accommodate a student's capabilities/handicaps (if necessary.)<br>  <br>  If you can find a Tai Chi Chuan (taiji as a martial art) I would suggest that... <br>  Mainly due to the fact that it does not use the belt ranking system...<br>  That means that you don't get instructors push you for testing fees.<br>  <br>  There are also the other internal martial arts.<br>  <br>  Judo might be a bit intimidating at first.<br>  Jujitsu.<br>  Aikido (a Japanese internal martial art.)<br>  <br>  Since I have a reconstructed ankle (lost a bout with the floor doing TKD,) I am zeroing in on the walking stick as a weapon. <br>  You can do this through just about any martial art that teaches weapons.

LIKkt8djaa	No it's the board's length. Your too big for that. That 139 is for somebody of like 70pounds and 4feet something, if you get to short a board it'll feel very loose and wobbly at high speeds, like you already mentioned.. As a beginner you would be better fit for a board around a 146-148 to learn on.|`|WTw9BSOYaa	Your board is fine, at 106 pounds you should be riding anything from around 138 to 144 area, you are at the base of what you should be riding, but the only thing that effects is the stiffness of the board.<br>  <br>  If you are on the high end of a boards weight range, it will be less-stiff, more flexible. Lower end of the weight range it will be stiffer. <br>  <br>  Over all this is fine for you as boards for beginners should be a bit more on the flexible side, its more forgiving when you ride and easier to learn on than a stiff board.<br>  <br>  The only differences in snowboards really are based on sex, a female board has different flex patterns because woman carry weight differently than males, so if you are a guy riding a woman's deck, that might be a problem, but even this would be so minor you wouldn't notice it.<br>  <br>  Over all learning to carve is more a confidence thing, the stage you are at what you ride isnt as important as you just getting out there and riding.<br>  <br>  If you haven't taken any lessons, id suggest signing up for them, they can help a lot.|`|T2UZXarLaa	Heh yeah sorry but 4 times is usually a bit soon to be carving it up. practice a bit youll get it. you may also want to get someone experienced to look at your set up.  preferably someone who works with them.<br>  <br>  first time i set up my board i put the bindings facing backwards so i was riding down the tail of my board which made it a bit harder as its slightly shorter and skinner than the nose. ive had my bindings modified 2 other times by different ski instructors each time its origionally thrown me off but after a few times it gets alot easier<br>  <br>  the board could be too short or too flexible but usually those are preference choices so you should be able to work it with these options|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Go here and compare prices<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.atticskateshop.com/boards.h..." rel="nofollow">http://store.atticskateshop.com/boards.h...</a><br>  <br>  Email them and let them know what your intentions are.

nu2SXdgYaa	I am a 300# rider that faced this question about 4 years ago.<br>  <br>  First things first....In this price range don't even think of getting a dual suspension bike. Finding a good hard tail bike (only suspension of the front fork) will be a better use of your $$$.<br>  <br>  The Hoss is a good choice, but pretty much any mountain bike that you can buy at specialty bike store (e.g. not Wal Mart) in your price range will have frames that are stronger (and heavier) than their high end counterparts.<br>  <br>  Such manufacturers are:<br>  <br>  Gary Fisher<br>  Specialized<br>  Trek<br>  Giant<br>  Kona<br>  <br>  In my opinion you get more bang for your buck with Gary Fisher brand bikes. I bought a Fisher Tassahara and never broke anything, even with on aggressive trails like Porcupine Rim in Moab.<br>  <br>  In summary, pick one of these manufacturers and spend as much as your budget allows.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Take a look at the Kona Hoss.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.konaworld.com/shopping_cart/frontend/products/product_detail.aspx?productid=101&parentid=182" rel="nofollow">http://www.konaworld.com/shopping_cart/f...</a>|`|APnVzUUFaa	The most important thing will be getting a durable set of wheels. As long as you get the bike at a bike shop and not at a department store, the frame should be able to handle the weight. Ideally it should be a steel frame, and in that price range almost all the frames will be steel anyway.<br>  <br>  If you can get 36-hole wheels, that would be ideal, but you will probably have trouble finding 36's stock on lower end bikes.<br>  <br>  Avoid any parts that are designed to be light weight, especially handlebars, saddle and fork. Again, this is usually not the case on low-end bikes anyway, but don't let anyone sell you on making the bike lighter to make it easier- in fact you might ask if there are heavier-duty parts they could switch out for you. Your main purpose is obviously the calories burned, so it doesn't matter how fast you go.<br>  <br>  Once you get the bike, keep a very close eye on the wheels. The heavier you are, the faster the wheels will go out of true, due to the spokes getting unloaded. Even a quality wheel hand-built by a professional is going to need constant maintenance under that much weight. If you ride every day, I would make a visual inspection for wobbles before every ride and a tension check about once a week ( especially the rear wheel ). That may seem like a lot, but you'll avoid a lot of hassle from broken spokes by doing this. Consider learning how to true wheels yourself, it is not particularly difficult to learn.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some, good luck.

Fp2smf6Yaa	To get rid of a stitch, change your breathing pattern. A side stitch is your body's way of telling you to make more room for breathing. To stop it, slow down and steady your breathing. If you get a stitch on the right side, exhale forcefully as your left foot hits the ground. Do the opposite if you get a stitch on the left side.<br>  Stitches are caused by not having enough room in your body to breathe.<br>  Dehydration can cause a stitch; it can also be triggered by fruit juice and squash emptying slowly from the stomach.<br>  Doing regular exercise keeps the stitches away and strengthens your abdominal muscles. During exercise our internal organs bounce up and down, pulling on the diaphragm muscles. If this tugging occurs when the diaphragm moves upwards - or when we breathe out - the strain is so great that it causes a stitch.<br>  My PE teacher says when you have a stitch while running you should slow down a bit and keep reaching to the floor every 10 seconds, it works so try it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

uclpkiQzaa	Ok everybody is going to think i am nuts but to be quite honest many quarterbacks in this years draft are suspect.  If lions are smart they will draft two bruising offensive lineman to add to there squad helping there run game with a decent runner that they already have. To take off pressure from the quarterback.  Lions your smartest choice this year is to stick it out one more year with the qbs you have strengthen your dl and o-line thats been there problem all along cant get pressure and always are pressured|`|AA10611307	stafford has never been impressive|`|H7AcXAyaaa	no|`|E1nWrW61aa	Stafford without a doubt.  Aaron Curry is an extremely talented athlete but Detroit needs to draft a young QB to start building their offense around.  He'll have an amazing receiving corps with Johnson, Taylor, etc...  But the Lions definitely have to draft a linebacker in the second round.  One draft is not going to solve all their problems, it will take time.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	mcshay is a moron not just cus he said that stafford is plenty mature enough he has started 3 years in the SEC curry is a beast but i think he goes to the chiefs|`|fiaFQAWWaa	The Lions should take Curry or Jason Smith and wait for Sam Bradford next year. This years QB's all suck.|`|37964990822e94f29802880a94facc8daa	i say take a tackle at number 1.|`|BwhMgmxFaa	I think the lions will draft shortstop Barry blonds

Or maybe its just because he had his worst year as a pro last yearf and wanted 2 get past it, by making some changes.|`|b4mDpU4faa	maybe because he had a bad year in 2008 he wanted to let dat go so he went from 28 to 53 plus he wanted to play like bobby abreu|`|YwEFJWR7aa	Michael Kay [Yankees broadcaster] asked him and he said that he always liked number 53|`|i9eAnKsBaa	because when the yankees signed brett tomko, brett pick #28 and melky change to #53|`|6AiZdcq2aa	cuz he wanted to start hitting like abreu|`|nRIREXjRaa	maybe he misses abreu and this way he can still be close to him
k0eGQjf9aa	he's obviously not talking about drinking right before he runs.  there are plenty of girls/guys on my team who will go out on the weekends and still run fine in meets and in practice.  i think as long as you aren't drinking on the weekends that you have meets you should be fine.  of course it's not the best thing for you, but if you drink every once in awhile you'll be alright.  i normally only drink in the off season though.|`|pwRh9MNlaa	it does affect you because it affects your reaction time to different things. so make sure you don't drink it or it'll mess up your whole running fun!|`|YjhlhUzVaa	Alcohol attacks your central nervous system and is tough on your digestive system.  It can cut into your endurance and wreak havoc on your recuperation time.|`|HaOtQogfaa	Alcohol might not make you run slower, but it does decrease reaction time a great amount. Alcohol also causes you to loss balance, which will keep you from running in a straight line and we all know the shortest distance between 2 points is a straight line. If you can't run straight, you will have to take several more steps to get where you are going, which slows you down.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Alcohol is performance enhancing.  You should drink a 40 oz before every competition.|`|mCPJhlNWaa	yes- it dehydrates yours muscles
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	No AC/DC won't be playing live at WM 25.They will just be providing two songs for the 25th anniversary of Wrestlemania instead.|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	Here's the bad news I just discovered:<br>  <br>  AC/DC will not be performing at WrestleMania XXV, due to European tour commitments. Linda McMahon commented late last year, at a cable conference, that the group would be performing the theme for the event. Apparently these comments were misunderstood, leading people to think the group would be performing live, when in actuality, WWE will just be using the group's music.|`|VlvektSJaa	Linda McMahon — Chief Executive Officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. — announced that rock and roll icons AC/DC will be performing the theme to Wrestlemania XXV, which is scheduled to take place on April 5, 2009 at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.<br>  <br>  <br>  It was announced on January 30, 2009 that "War Machine" and the live version of "Shoot to Thrill", both by AC/DC, would serve as the theme songs for WrestleMania.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	they were supposed to play their songs live at WM 25, but they canceled due to scheduling issues. their songs will still be played throughout the stadium.|`|bc5EELGhaa	unfortunately they canceled because of some unfortunate reasons and it will now be some rubbish band which i have no idea the name
Wz9tSKTaaa	You'd probably have got more answers if you'd put this in a different category.<br>  <br>  Neither A nor O is possible from this cross. The AB parent passes on either an A or a B allele, and the BB parent can only pass on a B allele, so the possible offspring can only be AB or BB (like their parents in this case - which isn't always the case). The genotypes AB and BB unsurprisingly result in the phenotypes AB and B. It's a 50:50 chance.<br>  <br>  If you were told it was a cross between an AB type and a B type that would be more complicated as you'd have to allow for the possibility of the B type being genetically BO rather than BB.
7B9KEqCnaa	The chargers arent going to release LT.  They may try and trade him, but Im sure the chargers would want some control on where they send LT.  The reason is simple, if LT is released, He is gonna go to the Broncos and then the chargers are going to have to face LT twice a year.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Green Bay is just right for him.Ryan Grant could use some competition at the postion.LT may be in the latter part of his carrer but still is better then most.If healthy these 2 could be an awsome duo.With Jennings and Driver for recivers this offense could be as good as any in the NFL.|`|9KEBtsNTaa	I think any team that utilizes their RB in the passing game would be a good fit for Tomlinson.  Teams like the Eagles, 49ers, Saints, or perhaps even the Dolphins.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	The Steelers could use a running back like him to play half the season before going down due to injury.  Mendenhall, Willie Parker, and Tomlinson almost add up to 1 whole running back.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Rams.

I see him being picked up by a contender, quite scarily possibly New England. I'd love to see him share carries with Brian Westbrook in Philadelphia. You'd have two of the greatest all-purpose backs in the NFL's history putting defenses on edge every play. However, I'm still not sold as of yet, San Diego is parting with him. If they cant get Sproles signed, they won't for sure.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	The Patriots hahahahahahaha......|`|cdQryr7paa	LT is still capable of being a very good RB for any team.<br>  Last I had heard he was being asked to restructure his contract to take a pay cut because the Chargers are determined to keep Sproles.<br>  There are a number of teams that need a decent RB right now.<br>  His problem is he can't stay healthy anymore, especially when the playoffs come around.<br>  I don't know if any of them are necessarily where LT wants to go, but we will see.<br>  I doubt they will release him myself, but I have been wrong before.|`|5xIroQjMaa	He needs to find a team that rotates backs.

7205d25da3a12d6568b00d8e6de5b56baa	You don't now... but did you find it?
mJFgCvYlaa	For less than $1000, you should be able to find some decent aluminum or steel road bike for road cycling and commuting, this price range you can even find ones with the frame partially in carbon as well when they're on sale.<br>  <br>  Since this is your first road bike, I would suggest you go to your local bike shop, take your time and ask a lot of questions. When you talk to the shop salespeople or the mechanics, you will gain a lot more knowledge than hanging out here in Y!A all day. Only once you feel knowledgeable enough, then you can look into craigslist postings and be able to tell which bikes are good, and which ones are not worthwhile to get. A lot of the craigslist postings are over priced, you'll definitely have to haggle, but you need enough knowledge firsthand.<br>  <br>  Or, take the easy way, and buy a new one at a local shop. Not only they will guarantee the bike fits you, usually basic maintenance is included and will take care of any warranty issues.<br>  <br>  Right now, since sales overall is slow this year due to the economy, expect some really good tent sales in springtime as they are clearing out last year's models.|`|p2uNE0FSaa	I recommend going on craigslist (type the word into your favorite search engine), finding your nearest city, then going into the bikes, then typing in 'Schwinn.' Then find the Schwinn that most likely fits your needs, most likely an old 3 speed or a 10 speed. Don't get a Schwinn made after 1982, when the manufacturing was sent overseas. The name badge should say 'Chicago' underneath the Schwinn. The Chicago-made Schwinns are pretty much bombproof, especially the Varsity. For commuting and general use, you should probably get a 3-speed or 5-speed Collegiate. Schwinns have indestructable frames and nearly indestructable rims. For $100 or less, you can have a fine riding bike, one that is not exotic, but reliable. Do a lot of comparisons, the are millions of good old Schwinns out there. One thing: Don't buy a low-end department store bike, they are junk and the rims and cranks will not survive real usage.  Few years back I bought a dept. store bike and the crank and rear wheel where ruined in less than a year of in-town general purpose usage.  I now ride a 1981 Schwinn Collegiate 3-speed 11 miles 2 times per day, commuting to/from work, and it is a dream.  Schwinn tires are a little peculiar, but I am able to find them at my local bike shop.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	go to local bike shop see what they have in stock.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Any of the local bike shops will have a model that is under $1000 for a road bike and less for a hybrid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jimlangley.net/crank/howtobuyabike1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimlangley.net/crank/howtobuy...</a>

And their best team and EPL proclaimed best team in the world was matched blow for blow and couldn't even score when they had an open goal gaping at them, their star diva Ronaldo was diving all over the place looking for a cheap goal, but thank goodness for Julio Cesar.  Now I understand how ManU beats all those other EPL teams.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	It doesn't matter who is in the semifinal or even final, only thing that matters is who will WIN it, so it means nothing if EPL will have 7 teams in next stage because Barca will win it anyway :D|`|JCRdicqXaa	These semi-finals of English dominance are becoming boring as we see it every week in England.<br>  <br>  Though we do understand it keeps the rest of Europe enthralled.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	oh the EPL  is most definitely the best league in the world!<br>  just look at last years CL final if you dont believe me|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I agree, at the moment it can only be considered as speculation.

UYMROk5Iaa	Yes, they are horrible.  That's cause recruiting is the key.  Teams like Duke, Connecticut, North Carolina always seem to do well in the recruiting department.  Who wouldn't want to go play there?  TV exposure, and if your called, you must be among the most sought out basketball players.  <br>  <br>  I compare Indiana to what Notre Dame is now.  Reputation will help recruiting; however, in order to draw the best players year after year, you do have to win.  If not, eventually top recruits will stop paying attention.  <br>  <br>  Good luck in in the tourney if they make it (I don't follow Indiana).  Go Longhorns.|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Nope|`|7QMRiROQaa	Well I think elite would mean you're a top team for a few consistent years. I don't see that happening anytime soon. I'm sure they will have another good year...but to put it together for multiple runs, eh probably not then. But what do I know really, I live in New York so I don't keep up with Indiana basketball as much as other places. As for them being in a small town...I don't think that will make much of a difference. I mean are you a Cards fans? I've been to Louisville and I thought it was a very small city...but that doesn't keep players from going there. Isn't like 13 of 15 players there from other states...like NY and NJ.

Are you saying that the Clippers are a winning team? LOL!<br>  <br>  Add KG and the Celtics don't lose.<br>  <br>  edit: dawg pound or whatever it is. First. I didn't say anything rude. Second. I never wrote "never lose". Third. I wrote, "Add KG and the Celtics don't lose.", because Zach went off for 30 points. The Clippers won by TWO points. Add Garnett and Zach doesn't score 30. Forth. I am not a Celtics fan. Fifth. Get off my bumper, unless you know what your talking about.<br>  <br>  Oh and one more thing  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKcFZvqEXjM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKcFZvqEX...</a><br>  <br>  Lucky teams don't win? Really? I think the 76ers would argue your point.|`|PjFLDSmdaa	She wants Revenge - You don't have to be so rude. The Clippers were the winning team, and they obviously outplayed the Celtics otherwise we'd have a different result. Am I right?  And if the Celtics and KG "never lose" How come they don't have the best record in the NBA?<br>  <br>  Be nice to Cavs in 09...she gives respect to anyone who deserves it, including when it isn't her team.<br>  <br>  Anyways to answer the question...I had an early night, so I didn't even realize the Celtics lost. That's a pretty big upset, but I guess every team has there bad games. I don't think the loss means too much...but if Pierce is still injured then that could really screw them up.|`|4gJTpitraa	Paul Pierce dislocated a finger in the third, and again in the fourth.<br>  <br>  They lost. Ray Allen shot 4-10 (he's an amazing shooter), and without K.G., it will be tough to defend down low.|`|e2zEchaYaa	well its a boston garnett hngover. without kg that team will not be able to beat the cavaliers and may be not even orlando

nxymxSUFaa	The Yes channel is devoted to all Yankees game past and present.  The new MLB network has been showing a good number of classic games.<br>  <br>  The one game I'd love to see again was a game during the 2004 season.  I was there sitting 12 rows back behind the Red Sox dugout.  The Yankees won this incredible game.  It was the same game Derek Jeter sailed into the first few rows to make a sensational catch.  I was maybe 20 feet away.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Nesn has loads of classic Red Sox games during the season.<br>  <br>  BQ:When Pedroia hit his first grand slam against the Yankees. He had an AMAZING game.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	On SNY(Mets station) <br>  They show them often. The last won I saw was game 5 of the 1969 W.S when the mets beat the Orioles. It was a great game it was funny because jerry koosman pitched the whole game. We never see that anymore. The best part was watching the fans run onto the Field and fight over the bases especially home ! <br>  <br>  BQ- YES ! I really want to see mets vs marlins game last year when we were losing by about 3 runs with two outs we came back to load the bases and beltran hit a grand slam. Man id love to see that again :)|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Yes the yankees show all the old games all winter long,now here's the best part they only show the games that the yankees won they "NEVER' air a game the yankees lost.<br>  Yes i love watching all the WS games we won and the 2003 game when Arron Boone hit the homerun deep into the night.<br>  They show these repeats alot.|`|aUyopOWiaa	Yes they do! I've watched a few Twins classics on FSN North before. <br>  <br>  BQ: Yes. One from last year that was exciting was when we came from behind to beat Boston. Mike Lamb got a walk-off single. That game really stands out to me from the 2008 season.|`|xIfvXy4waa	FSN has been playing the 50 greatest moments in our decade in the desert nonstop. I think I can recite the whole thing by memory :)<br>  <br>  BQ- Webb's ninth consecutive win or Davis's win after surgery for cancer|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Yes. The Reds play a game from the previous season every monday starting like 3 weeks ago. I would like to see the Reds game from last season when Jay Bruce made his debut. Great game.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	occasionly they do show some of the classic games<br>  one of most popular one is from 1978 the 23-22 game against the Phillies <br>  or the 9 run come back in 8th and 9th inning against the Astros<br>  and the (one i would love to watch) they showed a few time this year was the away game against well again against the Astros.. when Z threw a no hitter  First one since Milt Pappas No hitter back in 1972|`|mml9J88caa	Every Monday night starting a couple weeks ago we have "Mariners Mondays." And they show an old game. Recently since we got Griffey back they have shown us the ones like his last game as a mariner, last game at the kingdome, and when he came back in 07. They show it on FSN northwest. channel 30.<br>  <br>  BQ: yea, i didn't get to see any of the games when it  was interleague play since i was on vaction.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	I live in Baltimore, so we have a whole network just for our sports teams. We get all the Orioles and Nationals game. We get tons of re-runs.

It was very bitter sweet.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	Yes they do and i love to watch them on a boring Sunday!|`|TCehI17kaa	Yes they do. The Yes Network shows alot of Classic Yankee Games.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	I live in MN so the Twins do show old "Classic" games on FSN. <br>  <br>  BQ: I would love to watch few regular season games again. A few that come to mind are last year REdsox vs. Orioles Manny high-fives a fan on the fly and doubles up the runner on first.<br>  <br>  Playoff games: Redsox vs. Yankees game 7 ALCS 2004<br>                        Redsox vs TB game 6 ALCS 2007|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Yep.<br>  <br>  Couldn't tell you how many times I've seen the Pedro 8-0 1 hitter vs the Rays, when there was a huge brawl.<br>  <br>  Also for some reason they like to show the 86' Clemens 20K game alot too.<br>  <br>  I'm not to much into watching old games. Maybe every once in awhile I'll pop in the 2004 NESN DVD, but that's kind of special, don't ya think?|`|zTuc5eDIaa	Yeah, FSN Florida plays a lot of old Devil Rays games (from the Wade Boggs era) as well as games from their magical 2008 season. The one game I'd really like to see again? The first game in the team's history, March 31, 1998, when we ALMOST beat the Tigers. It's probably the only game that has ever sold out at the Trop.|`|t0v739asaa	Yes, I love watching Brewers classics on FSNWI.  <br>  <br>  I remember watching Ben Sheets getting 18 strikeouts from a few years ago not too long ago. It's great getting to see what the team looked like then compared to now.<br>  <br>  Besides, seeing Geoff Jenkins belt a homer never gets old.|`|sGrrbz1aaa	fsn cincinnati ...on monday nights....last year they showed tom brownings pergect game against thd dodgers in 88 and tom seavers no hitter vs cardinals ....and the indians len barkers no hitter against the bluejays in 81 on sports time ohio...all games were fun to relive...if your a fan of that team...|`|V6Fxf3Dbaa	Every so often,mostly its the "Before the Bigs".

zj4HeXEvaa	It has the same advantages as it would in any sport. Whether its football or rugby, or even something like snooker and darts balance is very important. Imagine trying to shoot at goal or throw a dart at a board when your off balance, it would be much less accurate.|`|GbyHQQLiaa	Well you can dribble better and faster and be more comfortable with the ball, therefore improving control of it. It also helps when you jump up to head the ball.
AA12129792	Assuming you don't mean American football...<br>  <br>  Acceleration means you speed up faster and get to the ball quicker.<br>  Aerial ability-jumping means you're more likely to win headers<br>  Agility means you're more likely to control a difficult ball<br>  Balance is important to avoid being tackled when dribbling<br>  Handling would be good for goalies<br>  Stamina means you can keep going at full pace longer - not tire easily<br>  Strength means you're more likely to win tackles or loose balls<br>  Throwing is useful in throw-ins or for goalies<br>  Shot Power - the harder a shot the less likely it is to be stopped<br>  Headers are useful to score goals from corners or defend corners.<br>  Tapping ?? No idea on that one.

JiCfYfLraa	yes he is boring and im tired of him and his lame deadman gimmick. he needs to go. his gimmick is just so lame and stupid all that thunder and smoke........like wtf thats CORNY. he is a little more decent as the american badass. i respect the undertaker but he is lame to me that damn gimmick is just......UGH. i like him more as the american badass. but still to me i think he is overrated in a way. the only way he losses id by a ko or a interference thats boring. i want him to get a clean lose.|`|CJzbIhWuaa	the people answering yes, u guys must be young and idiotic too say taker is boring, gosh u guys are dumb, and there is no speculation (other than internet fans, no backstage sources) that he will retire this year, 2 more at least|`|KIOR56r6aa	I think this kind of question should retire|`|UDqMdvESaa	He needs to go back to the American Badass gimmick|`|IkXU06wpaa	i think he should either join up with kane again or be the american badazz on the motorcycle|`|3k4tPNTGaa	He will be retire soon. There were speculation of him retiring him at wrestlemania 25 but i know he may have dropped that idea now coz he wants to wrestle for 2-3 years now. He has problems in his knees and he also getting old now. He has  a big fan base so wwe would be happy to see him around here for 2-3 more years. And most importantly he made wrestlemania special and something worth watching. He save all of his years energy for his one match in wrestlemania. Without him wrestlemania will get half of the importance its getting now.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	i kinda agree w/ u on this one, but he still has a huge fan base. and he's got the wrestlemania streak. but don't worry, i guarantee u in the next 3-5 years he will be retired.|`|xuNVegrGaa	im thinking he will retire after his match with HBK because he wont be able to top tht so after tht he should just retire.  I was hoping for him to have 1 more title reign but guess tht wont happen|`|VlvektSJaa	I think he has a good year or two left in the WWE.<br>  But I do agree that he is old and stale.|`|VHybyedbaa	i think he will retire in a buried alive match on his 20th year with the wwe which would be a survivor series.|`|WIiKPQZTaa	it wont be for a few years still, but his retirement will be a fake death.|`|qwdh7N6saa	NO! one more year.|`|KdcansIyaa	hahaha this is so true. hahaha<br>  <br>  Kick that man from the WWE|`|q5meh2YCaa	he should retire <br>  but not that he boring id say cena and batista are boring to much of a puch in such short time i takes real talent to win the wwe title and that is why i say cena suks with pride behind it|`|Pvg6djVSaa	he may be old but he can kick most wrestlers @ss these days anyway
xfJuyHoeaa	You have to be kidding me about him playing WR/KR did you guys forget about his cannons I mean arms.<br>  <br>  He could easily go to any team being's he will be very cheap for a struggling ball club to pick up.<br>  <br>  And it depends on how much he kept in shape while he was in the slammer if he let himself go for awhile he will never be as fast but if he did do a good job with rough workouts he should be in descent shape.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he has learned his lesson and had a change of heart about his crimes and will go to inner-city kids to try and change there way of thinking about dog fighting.|`|acaAycEXaa	He will never play in the NFL again. He wasn't a QB anyways. He certainly isn't worth the headaches he will cause.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I think he still face suspension after his prison release.  I don't think he can come back as a QB but maybe WR.|`|NshtVgsoaa	he is, but i doubt an NFL team will sign him<br>  cuz of  PETA following him|`|4rKBcybJaa	Vick will be back and i think he'll be better than he ever was. i know he wasnt just sitting around while in prison, and he has at least 6 months to a year to get back into football shape. i don't know if he'll be a QB but maybe a WR or a return guy. but we'll see soon|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	He ought to be made to play with about 6 or 8 Pit bulls that haven't eaten for about a week.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	He is still young enough to be an impact player.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <a href="http://americanfootballpredictions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...</a>

4L8h8Rp9aa	There is a good chance that they will be relocated or even disestablished. Keep in mind that this franchise used to be the Winnipeg Jets, so there may be a remote chance that they return there if they can get an upgrade to the arena they had been playing in. They had strong support in Winnipeg, and just have not been able to translate that down to fan support in Arizona. But they haven't made a payment on the lease for their current arena in months, and have reportedly lost 200 million dollars over the last few years. There is no way that the NHL can afford for them to keep failing at that rate.|`|AA11674745	Oh, how I wish I had a dollar for every sun-belt-team-to-Canada rumor I see. I haven't heard or read anything substantial - much less official - about ANY team moving anywhere since I read that the Oilers are nearly a lock to move to Kansas City.<br>  <br>  I don't want to see teams moving anywhere, but something inside me would be geeked if Canada loses another team because I'm sick of hearing how teams MUST be established there because the weather is always cold or because Canada invented the game.<br>  <br>  Get real.|`|WjsJowXLaa	yes there is. They just found out that the state is bailing the coyotes out by providing free rental of the arena. there team is doing bad as usual, havent been to the playoffs since who knows! and no one goes to thier games|`|jRRTdT4uaa	very high chance|`|ZRk15H9Caa	yes and its very high|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	No.  The team will either be sold to a new owner, or, at worst, relocated.  The league's commissioner has articulated that the league will, to every extent possible, do whatever it can to keep existing franchises in their markets.  So if new ownership can be found (and, ideally for the club, a new lease agreement can be worked out with the city), that would be the way forward.<br>  <br>  The franchise will not be disbanded.  If that happens (and it won't), it means the other 29 owners are now on the hook for that franchise.  Assuming a ballpark value of $230mm, that means each owner would have to pay 1/29th of that amount.  That's around $8mm in cash.  Each.  Not exactly sure each owner is willing to write that checque.  Dealing with someone like Jim Balsillie may be cheaper.|`|URO3gDXcaa	very big chance.  the talk is hartford getting them, but i don't believe that.  it would be winnipeg before them.

jwm0kQvNaa	Your guess is as good as mine.  I was going to say to clear up cap space, which is a normal business practice in the NFL, but he's only due $3 million in base salary next year and the Bucs are $43 mil under the cap.  He's 36, though, and hurt some of last year.  Doesn't sound like too many of the 35 and older crowds going to be back, though.  <br>  <br>  That's the best I can come up with- they're just gonna start cleaning house- starting with the old guys.|`|SMX228Olaa	I guess the only reason i can think of is because they want to go younger and in a new direction with there young coach. I don't see why you would ever release Derrick Brooks (a 11 time pro-bowler and a future hall of famer). But i think releasing all those guys is just going to hurt them because they all played well and were seasoned veterans.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	He's washed up.

I don't think he's washed up. He had an off season but what player doesn't.  Also he is 35 so he is declining but he isn't washed up.  I think it was a money issue.  Many teams have to make tough decisions each season to keep up with the salary cap.  Brooks was probably worth too much to keep.  Also you have to look at in a new head coaches point of view.  Gruden wanted him there, and their new coach didn't.  He had to evaluate things from his own perspective.  So there's a difference in coaching style as well.  But I believe it had to do with salary cap.  Its tough but things have to happen to meet the teams needs first.  But Brooks has given his all since he's been with the Bucs and he will be remembered.

Note that this is NOT the same as the 32 Long Colt. Also, those old shooters aren't exactly known for their extraordinary strength, so you need to be especially careful.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	As he said, you can fire .32 S&W long and .32 S&W short out of it.  That's it.  .32 ACP MIGHT fit.  But since it is basically a rimless cartridge, there would be nothing holding the case up against the breech face.  And while the firing pin might actually reach the primer, and set the cartridge off, you could still end up wrecking the gun that way.  Also beware of the .32 H&R Magnum, or the new .327 Magnum rounds.  In some older guns, these rounds may also chamber, but they are at much higher pressures.  That is a bad thing.<br>  <br>  If you want to get more bang from your .32, get into reloading.  I have 2 just like yours, and both of them are very accurate with 85-95 grain JHPs.  With hand loads (and real loading data from a REAL reloading manual), you can easily get better than .32 ACP performance out of these little guns.  And with a decent wadcutter load, you can thump Br'er Rabbit out to about 20 yards without wrecking the meat.  They make dandy little trail guns.|`|dpSr0icwaa	The 32 SW long can also fire 32 SW sometimes called 32 SW 'short' to differentiate it from 32 SW Long<br>  <br>  watch out for 32 Short colt, your gun can only fire 32 SW Long and 32 SW short, but not 32 short colt.  32 short colt is different.  I have never seen any Smith and Wesson designed to shoot 32 short colt, but as the 32 SW long was so popular, there are some Colt revovlers that shoot 32 SW short and long ammo, so you just can't judge what kind of 32 it is by the gun maker.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  32 auto and 32 acp are two different 'shortening' of the same name.  The full name is 32 automatic colt pistol.<br>  <br>  32 auto/32 acp shouldn't be fired in your gun.  It doesn't have a rim.  It will actually fire okay in an emergency, but the case will get stuck in the gun, and you may need a stick to poke it out, or maybe just give the gun a real good shaking.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you cannot find 32 SW or 32 SW Long, you can buy it online<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?productNumber=785351" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct/?pr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/33459-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/33459-5.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/43065-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/43065-5.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/65241-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/65241-5.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/67359-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/67359-5.h...</a>|`|hoZnJVXXaa	32 long was only meant to shot 32 long, acp and auto are two totally different rounds.<br>  <br>  As far as your 357 goes....you can shoot 38 spl in it.

This is sometimes abbreviated to .32 Auto. .32 ACP and .32 Auto are synonyms.<br>  <br>  When it comes to ammo interchangeability you have to take pressure and size into account, not just size. .32 ACP is loaded to higher pressure than .32 S&W Long. Your gun was not built to take the higher pressure.<br>  <br>  As for the .357 magnums, they are designed to take .38 specials as well as .357 mag. Just don't try to put .357 mag into a .38 special and expect the barrel not to bulge.

33830adac8471178d652a04c4a347442aa	Well seeing as he came over to the Indians from my Cubs and I've had the pleasure of watching him not play for 4 of the 10 years he was with us. I'll be the first to tell you, you should be a little concerned. Whenever he's had nagging injuries from the get go, it's never went well for him. And stiff backs, and shoulders are his most prominent injuries that has landed him on the D.L so often, besides that blister he had last season. I'm sure you'll see him pitch, because at least he's not a starter anymore, so you can limit him, but you better have a manager than knows how to manage and limit him, and a pitching coach that can manage him, or else he'll be injured a few times this season, I'm sorry to say. He has a fragile body, and unfortunately he's the Indians problem now. I'll miss Kid K as a Cub, but I won't miss all those injuries.|`|khbLZQHIaa	A little.<br>  <br>  I mean, he's an injury prone dude.  Usually injury prone people have a tendency to get injured(Lol, that wasn't obvious at all /sarcasm)<br>  <br>  However, I feel that Eric Wedge and Carl Willis can handle him.  Especailly since they have to deal with so many pitching injuries every year. (I mean, this is the Indians we're talking about...)<br>  <br>  So, expect a minor injury but also expect a big year from Kerry.|`|b4mDpU4faa	yes they really should because yankees r gonna win anyways
f6JWEBdDaa	Well...since we just franchised him, I expect he'll stay a Panther for one more year. The only way he can leave now is if another team offers huge money, and 2 first round draft picks! Don't get me wrong...I think Peppers is a fantastic athlete, maybe not Hall of Fame great, but top notch...it just bugs me that after all the good years he's had with Carolina, that he suddenly wants to go elsewhere! I mean...he just had his best sack year ever, and Carolina is still a Superbowl contender! So what gives? He's certainly lost a lot of fan support in the Carolina's recently!|`|goe3y4FPaa	I THINK HE SHOULD PICK FROM THESE ''3 OPTIONS''<br>  <br>  THE OAKLAND RAIDERS<br>  THE JAGUARS<br>  THE 49RS<br>  <br>  2 CALI TEAMS.. CAUSE IM FROM CALI.. THE JAGUARS.. CAUSE THEY REALLY SUCK..|`|8f264df90f04c294a122ee3032ed2541aa	Nowhere, staying in Carolina, panthers put franchise tag on him, so no team will touch him because he'd be way over priced.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	no where.|`|gUgzg81oaa	he will stay with the panthers if they offer him a good amount of $$$$ and if they don't i think the raiders might go after him to help out Burgess on the line. Tennessee might go after him to if they don,t resign Albert and maybe Dallas or Washington. and he is great|`|nlKg1g4Jaa	Dallas ,Raiders maybe Redskins . Anyone who pays alot of money for players on the backside of their playing days.|`|JhrdIVBgaa	He is going to stay here in my home-state, North Carolina. The Panthers would never let him go he is a hall of famer, why would they let him go?|`|SMX228Olaa	I think he is a above average DE but he is very overated, i hope that the Patriots sign him but that probably wont happen because they don't sign anyone under 35 anymore...............
qhEYwNYFaa	I was a cheerleader for 5 years. I was on 2 all star teams and have been to nationals.<br>  <br>  It depends on how good your high school team is. stunting and tumbling are extremley hard work, and its hard to start learning it that late. most girls who were on my all star team have either been doing gymnastics their whole life or cheered as kids. cheerleading is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports.

c6IbfP4Gaa	Almost any bowling alley that has a pro-shop and can drill the holes in a ball can also engrave your name. Mine has my name on it and my daughters' have their names. My husband went no-name on his. <br>  As for price.....Most shops will do one name for free when you buy the ball from them and get it drilled at the same time. Other than that it's about $5-10 for the name engraving. <br>  <br>  The cost of the bowling ball itself ranges. The cheaper ones by Columbia (which I use) are between $70 and $100. My husband has spent over $200 on one ball and there are balls out that cost over $300. <br>  There are tons of colors and also clear balls with embedded objects in them. For a sample go to your local bowling alley and look there. You might also ask if they have any used balls for sale.

l4WEwTWwaa	Nobody expected Jennings to win. It was simply to show the world that Cotto is not shaken after his loss and is still a force to be dealt with. Look at Naseem Hamed. He retired after his first loss, what did that prove? That he wasn't a real champ and had no heart. Cotto stepped up and showed the world that he is not shaken or done after his loss. Next for Norman Bates, dude it was for the WBO belt, not the WBA, it was mentioned only thirty times, if you're going to criticize Cotto at least bother to do research and find out more than his name. Last but not least as what everyone else said yes the WBO rankings are a joke and always have been.|`|xDaesbudaa	It was an exercise in getting over the Margarito fight, nothing more.  The next fight will be far more significant.|`|kBScgrVMaa	Miguel Cotto beating Michael Jennings proved only one thing.<br>  <br>  This fight proved what everyone has known for years...That the WBO ratings SUCK!! Jennings was ranked highly, yet Cotto was out of his league, by miles.<br>  <br>  The WBO can be blamed for some serious head injurie's suffered by fighters, being matched by over-whelmingly better fighters. <br>  <br>  Since the invention of the WBO and even lesser titles, boxing injuries have got worse. <br>  <br>  We may aswell legalise underground maulings, after all, that's all this spectacle was! <br>  <br>  WBO stands for...We Beat Ordinaries. <br>  <br>  Remember the days (1970s '80s) of the likes of Roy Shaw? The likes of him had to go underground to get anywhere, it's guaranteed, if all these titles were around in Shaw's day, he'd have been undisputed champion for years!<br>  <br>  Even Calzaghe has proved the WBO means nothing, his record is full of bums, and he has retired, after 11 years as champ with a ring earning of ￡20m, after 11 years and 21 defences, I'd want a bit more than that crap money!! <br>  <br>  Cotto beating Jennings proved NOTHING, but, it gave Cotto a title to bargain with, to get back into the big time.<br>  <br>  Miguel will go on to unify against Mosley, then hopefully, tempt the pretty boy out of "retirement".|`|R0J1W3BCaa	This fight proved absolutely nothing most boxing insiders believed that  Jennings had no chance and he didn't. Personally I believe that it was a cheap and easy way to kill three birds with 1 stone they got Miguel Cotto back into the mix for 1. and 2. They did it with a relatively safe opponent. 3. He captures the  WBA title it couldn't have been an easy-er cake walk.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	It proved that there are a bunch of knuckleheaded Cotto fans stupid enough to cough up the cash for a pay-per-view fight that was too crappy for espn friday night fights.|`|jHqV6yUxaa	He proved that he was back, and that his last fight didn't affect him. At least that's what they are trying to make it seem.|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	This fight was to see what stage Cotto was at after the severe beating he took from Margarito.  Everyone wants to talk about how Jennings was overmatched and so on, which on fight night proved to be true.  But I can bet that not one guy on this forum ever seen more than one fight of Jennings, and they immediately deemed him to be unworthy of fighting Cotto, just because THEY never heard of him  And now that Cotto beat Jennings soundly they are quick to  to point out that they knew it was going to happen when they had no real hard evidence to back up their predictions.  Plus the fight was for the WBO belt and if I'm not mistaken isn't the number 1 contender supposed to fight the #2 or 3 in that organization to get the belt?  As much as I love boxing, I know that its a business and sometimes fights are gonna have to be on PPV.  HBO and Showtime turned these fights down.  Where is Top Rank supposed to turn?  Network televsion aint havin boxing on their networks.  $hit I just noticed I went into a totally different question.  Sorry about that. LOL.  To Norman Bates, Cotto actually won the WBO belt Shane Mosley has the WBA belt|`|dP1BwV6baa	Unfortunately I wasn't able to see the fight, but didn't prove much in challenging his skills. If he still looked good it proved that we still have the hungry powerful boxer-puncher in the game at 100 percent after he suffered his first career loss and not just a loss but a beating(hopefully without plaster but we will never know), and that is Very important. There are many great fighters that cannot digest the taste of defeat and are never the same after. A true champion should be able to get back up and look great again, or even better from learning from his loss. And I heard that after the fight he said he would like to fight anyone from Clottey, Mosley again, Hatton-Pacquiao, so that shows that he is confident again. That's what I like about him, he doesn't duck anyone when asked.|`|WuByn7ulaa	<a href="http://sportzone.do.am/blog/2009-02-22-17" rel="nofollow">http://sportzone.do.am/blog/2009-02-22-1...</a>
l4WEwTWwaa	Cotto-Mosley would not only generate the most money, but it is also a very likely scenario. People were talking about Margo but he has been banned for a year and won't be available for a while. Next after his huge win over Margo there are so many bandwagon fans and loyal fans that would shell out big bucks for a PPV rematch. Not to mention that the first fight left a lot of questions and Mosley now holds Cotto's old belt which can really add fuel to the promotion for the fight. Last but not least we all know about Cotto's screaming fans that would also add more money to the gate and PPV. It would make the most on that list and is more likely the next step for Cotto.|`|xDaesbudaa	I would say Cotto-Mosley II, but the sales it would generate wouldn't hold a candle to a Cotto-Pacquiao I.|`|R5G9h2ygaa	I would say Cotto v Mosley II and Cotto v Pacquiao could both potentially be the biggest grossing fights of the year, in each the opponent would be the biggest drawcard rather than Cotto, I dont think anything will be lost on the fact that Cotto has already beat Mosley either because Mosley's defeat of Margarito has everyone seeing him differently.<br>  Cintron and Berto would be the next two biggest money earners, Berto is developing a following though the Collazo fight has me thinking he is overrated, Cintron has been around for a while and has fought Margarito so he would also attract buys. Unfortunately Clottey's inability to knockout Judah and his workmanlike style makes him an underrated and little known fighter even though he has as good a chance as Cintron or Berto of beating Cotto|`|R0J1W3BCaa	Shane Mosley 2 would probably generate the most money because Shane is coming off his biggest win in years and this fight would sell like hot cakes epically in LA. However fighting Shane right now would be dangerous for Cotto considering that the Jennings fight didn't really answer any questions that we still had about him after his loss to Margarito. Jennings didnt test him at all everyone knew he would easly beat Jennings. Right now thier is too much of a question mark behind Cotto's name and a Mosley fight is too dangrous.|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	Without a doubt Cotto-Mosley II.  Cotto beat Mosley, Margarito beat Cotto, Mosley beat Margarito, what a great storyline.|`|xgBNImTHaa	ima go with cotto vs cintron think about two purto rican boxers fightin in las vegas or ny thats like a sellout crowd|`|dP1BwV6baa	I agree with the others that Cotto/Mosley would generate the most out of these as they are both bigger known names. Their first fight was pretty close and Mosley is feeling better now than before after destroying Margarito and showing that he still has speed and power to outbox or terminate any opponent. Shane Mosley is where Cotto was and Miguel Cotto is where Mosley was( people are asking if he is still the same after his loss against Margarito). I think the second fight will be even better that the first, I thought they had a little respect in their first fight. In their rematch they will both have more pressure to prove is the the top name right now.<br>       But if I can add a match, Miguel Cotto vs. Manny Pacquiao hands down in my opinion wouuld generate the most money which is still possible at 147.|`|WuByn7ulaa	Miguel Cotto vs. Michael Jennings Replay is at<br>  <a href="http://sportzone.do.am/blog/2009-02-22-16" rel="nofollow">http://sportzone.do.am/blog/2009-02-22-1...</a>

TBu2iaPaaa	alt of awesomeness happend|`|Voa3zqGFaa	PORTLAND, Ore. – In the stunning wake of No Way Out, an Ultimate Opportunist brings the World Heavyweight Championship back to SmackDown, a brother’s hatred fuels another vicious insurgence and a restored king makes a furious decree.<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy def. Edge (DQ) (Non-Title Match) (WATCH | PHOTOS) <br>  After making history by competing in two Elimination Chamber matches in one night at No Way Out, new World Heavyweight Champion Edge made his gleeful return to Friday Night SmackDown. When the Rated-R Superstar denied the emerging Jeff Hardy his challenge, Hardy ridiculed the champion’s relationship with his wife before hitting him with a Twist of Fate. (PHOTOS)  An embarrassed Edge then told General Manager Vickie Guerrero that he would be facing Hardy later that night.<br>  <br>  At the climax of their whirlwind match, Hardy hit Edge with the Swanton Bomb. Victory seemed imminent for the high-flying Superstar, when from out of nowhere, Matt Hardy attacked, hitting his brother with a Twist of Fate of his own. As the smoke cleared, Matt challenged an unconscious Jeff to a match next week.<br>  <br>  J.R.’s Exclusive Interview with WWE Champion Triple H about the events on this week’s Monday Night Raw(WATCH)<br>  In an exclusive interview, Triple H told J.R. that when Randy Orton put his hands on his wife, Stephanie McMahon – following weeks of attacks on the McMahon family - he "crossed the line" that he can never come back from. The Game was too upset to finish the interview, ripping the microphone from his shirt and leaving without a word. However, with word that The King of Kings will be at Raw to confront Orton this Monday night, one can only speculate on the horrific ramifications that will follow.<br>  <br>  Divas Champion Maryse & Michelle McCool def. Maria & Eve Torres (Divas Tag Team Match) (PHOTOS) <br>  Maryse made her return to action, entering into a seemingly bittersweet tag team partnership with the foe she defeated for the Divas Championship, Michelle McCool. While Eve was mounting an offense on Maryse in the corner and the referee was distracted by getting Maria out of the ring, Michelle delivered a powerful kick to Eve’s head, paving the way for Maryse to pick up the win.<br>  <br>  World Tag Team Champions The Miz & John Morrison have their Valentine's Day date with the Bella Twins (WATCH)<br>  WWE Tag Team Champions Carlito & Primo disguised themselves as waiters to disturb the Valentine’s Day date that Miz & Morrison won with Nikki & Brie Bella one week ago. But their plan ended in disaster when The Colons accidentally threw two pies into the Bella Twins’ faces. Next week, Carlito and Primo will defend their Tag Team Championships against the “Dirt Sheet” duo. If Miz & Morrison can prove victorious, they will become the Undisputed Tag Team Champions.<br>  <br>  Montel Vontavious Porter vs. United States Champion Shelton Benjamin & Chavo Guerrero (Handicap Match) (PHOTOS) <br>  Following the sneak attack by the Gold Standard last week and post-match Frog Splash by Chavo Guerrero, MVP attempted to recruit tag team partner R-Truth to extract his revenge. However, Benjamin & Guerrero took out R-Truth as he was making his entrance, prompting the Ballin’ Superstar to take both on in a Handicap Match.<br>  <br>  When Benjamin tagged himself in just as Guerrero was closing in on the win, Chavo turned his outrage on his partner. He hit the Gold Standard with the Frog Splash before taking off, leaving MVP to execute the Drive-By on the dazed United States Champion. As a result, MVP added another victory to his winning streak as the race for the United States Championship continues to heat up.<br>  <br>  Umaga def. Scotty Goldman (PHOTOS) <br>  Umaga decimated Scotty Goldman as he has every Superstar that has crossed his path since his return to WWE. Despite some comical words by Goldman about his opponent Umaga prior to the match,  he wasn’t laughing for long. Umaga laid waste to Goldman, hitting a combination chokeslam, Samoan Spike for another impressive victory.<br>  <br>  SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero disputes Undertaker’s opponent at the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania (WATCH what she had to say on SmackDown).|`|CaqdDzQZaa	The normal pyro and Smackdown opening.<br>  <br>  the 2/27 edition of SmackDown opens with Vladimir Kozlov vs Undertaker and Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy being announced for later in the night.<br>  <br>  John Cena opens to mostly cheers and says it great to be back at smackdown. he says its been 2 years since he last was on smackdown, but not much has changed. says smackdown moved to mynetwork tv and he didnt know he owned a tv network. cena says 'micheal cole' looks the same except he is wearing a coboy hat. (referring to j.r.). he says that smackdown still has the same great fans to a pop. he then talks about promising that he would find edge and give him a fight. so thats what he is here to do. he calls out edge. edge makes his entrance. He asks for a World Heavyweight Championship re-match. Edge accepts, but Vickie comes out and says Edge won’t be competing tonight. Cena charges but Vickie says something. I can’t hear because there is so much heat on Vickie. i think she says cena will be facing someone tonight, but not edge and introduces Big Show as his opponent for later on in the show. big show's music plays as he walks on the stage to end<br>  the segment. (it will be interesting to see if jr or tazz announce that cena was traded to smackdown for triple h during this segment.)<br>  <br>  Carlito & Primo vs. The Miz & John Morrison for the WWE Tag Titles.<br>  A good match with a couple of missed spots. during the match the Bella Twins came to ringside to watch the action. primo was isolated in the heel corner as miz and morrison controlled the matchup for a while. primo finally got in some offense and baught enough time to tag in carlito. carlito came in and hit some offense. at the end of a back forth match carlito hit the Backstabber on Morrison for the win. the colons retain the WWE Tag Titles. after the match The bellas left with Primo and Carlito. one of the twins looked back at Miz and Morrison like she wanted to stay with them and wasn't necessarily happy to leave with the colons.<br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Kozlov<br>  A very long match that was boring in spots but the crowd was firmly behind Undertaker throughout the contest. Kozlov botches snake eyes twice. taker finally goes for old school, but kozlov reversed it into a powerslam and gets the 3 count. Surprisingly clean pinfall victory for Kozlov, (judging by vickie's comments on the 2/20 taping and kozlov's win over the undertaker, it looks like kozlov may be at least temporarly in the picture to face taker at wrestlemania.)<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy<br>  Matt out first. then Jeff comes out in street clothes, which surprised everyone. Jeff on the mic says they’ve always been together and that they will always be brothers. Matt says he is not his brother. He goes on a long semi-shoot about how the fans love Jeff more and how it is about Matt this time. He says the fans wouldn’t forgive Matt if he committed Jeff’s sins. Matt blames the fans and Jeff for his mediocre career. He says Jeff is all hype. Matt says fight me but Jeff refuses. Matt slaps Jeff twice but Jeff exits the ring and walks away up the ramp to a mixed reaction. There is no match.<br>  <br>  Shelton Benjamin vs. Chavo.<br>  mvp made his entrance in business suit sans the jacket and sat with j.r. and tazz at the announce table to be was a guest on commentary.<br>  Benjamin threw Chavo into MVP at one point. <br>  Benjamin Taunts MVP then gets cradled for the roll up 3 count. and Chavo Guererro defeated Shelton Benjamin. as Shelton looked stunned by his defeat, MVP hit the Drive By Kick on Benjamin.<br>  <br>  John Cena vs. Big Show<br>  Huge pops for both athletes. long match with offense back and forth. match was so long the crowd was dead for awhile. looked like cena and show were improvising alot. Cena finally hit the Attitude Adjustment on his 2nd attempt and then Edge ran out and slid in and out of the ring without even touching Cena. weird spot. Cena was distracted by Edge at ringside and gets the KO from Big Show. High elevation Showstopper for the pinfall victory. Edge gets in the ring and poses over Cena to end the tv show. <br>  (triple h did not appear on the 2/27 episode of smackdown. im sure raw on 2/23 will reveal why.)<br>  <br>  bonus dark match:<br>  casket match: undertaker vs big show.<br>  during big shows entrance he acted paranoid, even turning quickly towards the fans at the corner where the ring steps are.<br>  taker Kicks and punches Big Show. show falls and taker rolled show in the casket with his foot and slammed the lid shut. the match was around a minute. my friend looked at a text and the match was over. no one around me expected that short of match given the advertising it had locally. after taker left up the ramp rather quickly. the ring crew opened the casket and show freaked like he ants on him and flopped around a little before exiting up the ramp.<br>  <br>  Biggest Pops:<br>  1) John Cena<br>  2) Jeff Hardy<br>  3)Undertaker<br>  <br>  Biggest Heat:<br>  1) Vickie Guerrero (seriously, this woman has tremendous heat.

High elevation Showstopper for the pinfall victory. Edge gets in the ring and poses over Cena. Edge is limping noticeably. <br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Vladamir Kozlov <br>  <br>  A very long match that was boring in spots but the crowd firmly behind Undertaker. Kozlov botches snake eyes twice.

3m9DQuDRaa	Cena isn't that great, but mainly because the WWE overpushed him to the point where we hate him on principal, not because he's talentless (which he isn't...  he's a great talent).  Most people liked him when he was a heel, and his moveset was fresh.<br>  <br>  To answer your questions, though...  Sadly, Cena will be more remembered than Edge, solely because Cena is geared for the kids.  Kids will remember hi as the Hulk Hogan of their era...  just like Stone Cold was the Hogan of yours (probably).  Cena will end up being in the hall of fame 15 years from now, and we'll have a new Cena by then.<br>  <br>  In terms of casual fans, Orton has more haters...  the casual fan seems to like whomever the WWE is telling them to like (perfect example are girls who like Jeff Hardy and hate Matt because he hit him...) while the REAL hardcore wrestling smark probably hates Cena with the passion of the Christ.<br>  <br>  I know for certain that I hate John Cena for the time being, solely because I'm tired of seeing his face.  Don't get me wrong, Edge and Orton will have their place in the HOF in their time...  But only time will tell how everyone will be remembered.|`|NWtgYyF6aa	I think Edge will be remembered for his TLC Matches and his Accomplishments as he is the only one who has held all major title on Raw and Smackdown.<br>  <br>  John Cena has more haters because he has been champion for too long and is overrated.However Randy Orton has more haters when he says things like he will file an injunction so there is no wrestlemania however he is athletic but he uses lots of headlocks.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both men have nice bodies so women like them for that.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Both will be remembered.<br>  <br>  Cena doesn't suck, he happens to be a great worker who is happy to do what the WWE wants and loves the fans.<br>  <br>  Cena does have more haters than Orton, though Orton would possibly rather have due to his heel status. What a blow to the ego it must be for the big heels in the business to be out booed by the Cena haters! LOL|`|AA11118482	Edge will never be forgotten.

But, when you compete and represent something more than just yourself or team, it puts that identity under the microscope. It's OK to win for your group, but when you don't win, there will be people who call your whole group on it. Now, you have all this to win for, run hard and win one for God.|`|pATAONudaa	Idk, I can honestly say I've never seen that. I don't think you will be able to wear it in a track meet, even though I'm sure you could get away with the "it's against my religion" card. I would probably laugh because it would be ironc, most girls wear sports bras.|`|70AGy17eaa	were something else|`|PSVhBTlgaa	No, there are 'sports' hijab, seen it at bejing olympics. <br>  <br>  Why are you asking the question?  Decide what you think is right, hijab or no hijab. <br>  <br>  Why do you wear the hijab? Don't be afraid to challenge other people's ideas. Some think that not wearing the hijab means you are not serious about morality. An eyptian girl told me that religious leaders in egypt explain that the burqa etc is a form of vanity, not found in the qoran but in pre-muslim traditions, and a good muslim woman wears a headscarf, and isn't obliged to wear it in non-muslim countries. There are some very respectable muslims who are worried that women choose to wear hijab because they consider it to promote an unfair and injust society. How would you explain your decision to them?<br>  <br>  So think untill you find what seems right to YOU or just do as someone else tells you, although different muslims will give different answers.<br>  <br>  EDIT FOR NOKIAMAN<br>  <br>  and death can come at any time...........<br>  <br>  Plants are amazing.  A tree that draws up water from a dirty, muddy stream will produce plentiful, beautiful and pure fruit which nourish life. How come? All life needs light. Some call it Allah, some god, some reason. Fed by light, a tree has many natural functions that will make itself pure. A tree that doesn't draw up water, or only draws up a little 'pure' water will produce a few hard, dry fruit which nourish no-one.<br>  <br>  and death can come at any time...........<br>  <br>  Fruit that is small, bitter and tasting of ignorance and fear.<br>  <br>  or perhaps religion doesn't really matter Nokiaman says you will look more beautiful. Social pressure from parents, iman, friends is not religious ideal. Maybe social pressure is more important to you and really you are scared that maybe no 'good muslim' will marry you but I would have thought a girl who wants to run is a strong person.|`|CvahPOtNaa	umm..<br>  <br>  no i dont see why not? if you can run track then run! that boy is prolly jealouzzzz<br>  <br>  <br>  haha hope this helped<br>  Good Luckk|`|2cywkJ5Uaa	In the track meets they won't let you wear anything like that.<br>  but i doubt anyone would laugh because it's your religion.|`|IhGdhL3maa	get something to hold the hijab|`|7a4be0ccfeaad7f23fda8c4df26efe8daa	i've seen people in XC races wear them

GCUGHjgxaa	different places have different certification requirements, so the tests will vary depending on what certification you're going after. generally, there's swimming laps involved, learning rescue skills, learning cpr, and then being tested on what you've learned. as long as you're in decent shape and can swim, you should be fine. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|O22gnXtWaa	For Canada the LSSC (Life saving society Canada) requires you to:<br>  able to 15m headup approach dive to max of 3.2m to retrieve 20lbs and eggbeater 5m to edge. Pita carry is also required, then spinal board. These are the most common failure to problems.<br>  <br>  It is not that hard, but remember certification means little in most high pay places as they have higher standards. FYI LSSC Lifeguard Cert is higher standard than Red Cross. I consider LSSC cert nothing compare to the pool requirements.|`|e6194ade1f407494b6f0be00450abb7caa	You need to be CPR certified, certified to use an AED as well as first aid. The lifeguard certification test requires you to perform several types of rescues for several types of situations, such as when you need to use a backboard, rescue tube, when a person is unconcsious and so forth. The class is incredibly easy if you can swim. No prior knowledge is needed. You dont have to study in advance. My advice is just show up, give it 100%, and study for the test you have to take, i believe it is 40 questions but i could be wrong(u need a b to pass), and you wil be fine. The test is meant to weed out the kids who dont belong. Dont worry, if it is meant for you, you will pass.|`|t3b3YBmiaa	As a certified lifeguard, i'm about to retake the test myself to become re-certified.  it's a fairly easy test. i've been on the swim team since i was 4, but there were several people in my class who weren't great swimmers.  for the pre-class test, we had to swim a 500, part free, part back, and part whatever, and then we had to swim to the deep-end, dive to the bottom, pick up a 10 pound brick and swim back to the other end of the pool with it, then you take the class, and the next test only has to do with stuff from the class, nothing too difficult

They might have a year or two where they win the Big XII North and play for the conference championship, but they'll never win it and will probably have to settle for 8-4 or maybe once or twice a decade, 9-3.  OU and texas will always be the conference champs until either Bob Stoops or mack brown leave their current jobs.|`|RS3fjNboaa	LOL! OU has lost 3 of the last 4 to Texas and the only reason they even get into Big 12 championship games is because they back into them. OU is an embarassment to the Big 12 in bowl games.

OrvTG44laa	You do need a license.  For most states, you have to take a course.  In NY, you had to attend two five hour classes and then pass a test.  Look online and find out what your state's laws are.  Many hunting stores offer classes and you can get your license there.  That is where I got mine.  <br>  At the hunting store, you will find a ton of experts.  Both the people who work there and the customers can answer any questions you need.<br>  The next step, after getting a license, is to find what gun you should get.  This all depends on what you are hunting.  If you are mostly hunting rabbit, turkey or birds, a shotgun would be a better choice than a rifle.  This is because a shotgun shoots out many small pellets.  All these little pellets shoot out and spread out.  They go in a 'V' direction from the barrel.  Shotgun is good for fleeing prey.  Try hitting a bird while it's flying or a rabbit while it's running with a rifle.  For animals that aren't going to be running, like coyote, deer, fox, bobcat, etc, a rifle will do.  I recommend a 12 gauge.  <br>  So after you decide on a type of gun, you need to select the gauge or caliber.  For shotguns, I'd go with a 12 gauge all the way.  If you're only hunting small game with a shotgun though, like rabbit, a 20 gauge might be better.  But a 12 gauge will be good enough.<br>  For small game, like squirrels, jackrabbits, raccoons, groundhog and rabbits a 22 long rifle will be perfect.  The 22 long rifle is a great gun.  They're very low priced, the ammo is the cheapest out there and most are semi auto.  You can find a brand new, good semi auto 22 long rifle with a scope for 150 to 170 bucks.  But for bigger game, like fox or bobcat, you'll need a 22 magnum.  Coyote is a 223, and whitetail deer is a 243 or 270.  Elk and black bear are a 308.  As you can see, you need to pick the right caliber.  Not any caliber will do.  <br>  Finally, when you've decided on a gun and have your license, you need to learn how to shoot.  Some people are naturally good at it.  Others can't shoot a target 10 feet in front of them.  Make sure your rifle is sighted in correctly, and practice.  This is where a 22 long rifle comes in handy, because the ammo is so cheap( 500 rounds for 20 bucks).  When you trust that you are a good shot, it's time to go hunting.  <br>  Remember, any hunting store will be filled with experts who can answer any questions you have.  Most are more than willing to share thier knowledge with you.  Good luck!|`|TPZwmQK9aa	First, go to your state's wildlife department web site and get the schedule for hunter safety classes.  You will have to take one in order to get a license.  When you take it, you will learn a lot more than just safety.<br>  While there, introduce yourself to people and tell them that you are new to hunting, and just listen to what they have to say.<br>  Try to find someone you can trust who is a hunter, and get them to take you.  Read magazines like Outdoor life, and articles online, but don't ever take anything as being 100% true.  Only experience in the field, and learning from someone in person, can teach you what you need to know.|`|4TLlrJnuaa	I agree with OkieRoad in that you should take a hunter safety course. <br>  Also, talk to the people in your area at gun stores, gun shows, anything. If they are willing to take you out with them and you trust them, go. You can only really learn in the field.<br>  Then I would consider reading about the different game animals in your area and after you find one that you would like to hunt (start with smaller animals usually, especially not dangerous game until you have experience) buy yourself a decent gun suitable for that game and target practice, a lot. Shot placement is extremely key in taking an animal humanely.|`|8oY6C3yBaa	Here is my advice.<br>  *Visit a local outdoors shop. Get their professional opinions on what rifle you may need.<br>  *You will need to take a hunters ed class. They take about 12 hours over the course of 2 days.<br>  *Go hunting with a friend. Hunting isnt for everyone. You will need to get comfortable with the fact that you are killing an animal, and all the steps involved in preparing the animal to be eaten.<br>  <br>  Good luck if you need more help, drop me a line.<br>  Matt|`|bgxYKsGiaa	you have to learn it on your on and you just cont "simply take hunting up as a hobby " you have to have it in your blood

They told him his gun was dumb.  About 10 years later, Eugene redesigned his gun to fire a much smaller bullet and named it the AR-15, and tried to sell it to sportsmen.  About this same time the Air Force wanted a nice light little gun, so they bought this AR-15.  They even asked for some models to be fully auto.   yadda yadda, army saw it yadda yadda army bought some to experiment with, yadda yadda, army bought a whole bunch in one specific configuraiton.<br>  <br>  The AR-15 is a TYPE of gun.  The M-16 is a subtype of AR-15.  The M-16 is the government designation for an AR-15 that has a 20 inch barrel, low profile barrel, triangular handguard, forward, asssist, and has a safe-semi-full switch setting.<br>  <br>  Some people try and say that the M-16 is 'full auto' and the AR-15 is a 'semi-auto civilian version'<br>  <br>  This is not true.  While MOST AR-15s are semiauto, this is simply because there are a ton of restrictions on owning a fully auto AR-15.<br>  <br>  it is also untrue that if it is full auto it must be an M-16.  M-16 is just a US military designation.  The very same gun is used in Canada and called the C-7, in the Phillipinese the gun is called the MSSR|`|0NSax0u9aa	An AR fires only in semi and the M16 fires both semi and full auto or 3 round burst other than that they are the same rifle.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	M16 == Full Auto, Semi Auto, or 3 round burst (depending on model)<br>  <br>  AR15 = Semi-automatic only.......|`|m5FyTeYgaa	M16 is the military version assault rifle, and fires full-auto.

AA11539218	If you have access to  a trampoline, that is a very good tool to help out with learning tricks.  Also on the 360 you can attempt it only over one wake first...then when you get use to the handle pass you can take it wake to wake.  If you search around youtube there are several "how to videos" from pro coaches all around the world that will help you with the fundamentals of most basic tricks (tanturm, front roll, scarecrow, back roll, toe side backroll, front flip, 360's, BS 360's, etc...)<br>  <br>  If you are nervous about trying it, the hardest thing to do is get past that first attempt....after you try any trick once it isn't as scary.  Plus if you take a few good falls, you eventually just don't think they hurt anymore ;) lol.|`|IqtCwl8taa	Having the confidence to try more tricks is partly down to getting used to the falls (get used to the worse case scenario, i.e. a fall, and the thought of trying a new trick isn't so daunting anymore) and partly down to knowing what to do. If you understand the trick you want to try, have seen it done and know the technique involved then you will be much more confident when it comes to trying it out yourself. There are loads of instructional DVDs that can help loads with this and they are definitely not just for beginners - have a look around.

syzMIfLLaa	That is a hell of a team, you must be in a smaller league.  Your looking at the trade the right way, trading for a category, steals.  That is what this trade gives you.  Also, it gives you security if Manny doesn't sign. You will be pretty solid in saves so even if you loose a few in the trade, you'll be ok.  the only question I have is about your keepers.

82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Seen as you've only used a treadmill for running training so far its no surprise what happened actually happened, it appears you just ran too fast. Treadmill running allows you to keep a perfect pace and you can easily alter this to suit your needs, however when you run outside you have to judge your pace and since you have not been running outside yet you have not developed this ability yet.<br>  <br>  As other people have mentioned outside running places more strain on your body which requires it work harder, the advantage however is you'll become a better runner and the training is more specific to the race.<br>  <br>  Try to run more often outside to develop your pacing, simply if your breathing very heavily you are going to fast regardless of whether your feet are ok. Slowly build up the intensity throughout the session and also over the training weeks/months. In a very short period of time you will be able to automatically running at manageable steady pace.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	Running on the road is significantly different than running on a treadmill.  If I train inside, I'll bike, row, ski, or use an elliptical, but pretty much never use a treadmill because it screws up my stride and my breathing.<br>  <br>  And hopefully you mean February 2010.  It's probably a little late to start training for a marathon on Saturday.|`|jvHUsl3uaa	Treadmill is worse for you in running wise. You run better a lot betters outdoors. You experience running uphill and downhill and in different temperatures. You also run in different paces. Treadmills don't really do that. This isn't freaking weird and this is normal for those who practiced on treadmills all winter long and try to run outdoors in the spring. Running on the Treadmill is a bad habit to take in. Like I said, you will get a lot more better outside. Hope this helps!|`|NK6AtTWBaa	i hate running on treadmills.  they make me run worse and find that they make me slower and not faster.  however i think that the reason for your problem is that the air is thin right now and that made your lungs depleted for more air where the air in your house is much thicker.  for future refences, i recomend not running on a treadmill.

Crocop is not any bigger than Chuck, so he should be able to make 205.|`|nRBC4E5saa	He was already exposed.  He has no takedown defense and only mediocre ground control.  The reason he looked so bad in the Cote fight wasn't because of Cote, it's because Silva wasn't motivated.

I think it was probably the best they could do given what's out there.  <br>  Cassell looks like a bust, to me.  Garcia is showing his age.  Warner looks good in ARI but would get exposed in MN.  <br>  At least Rosenfels doesn't cost them too much.  <br>  Unless McNabb actually becomes available, I think they did the best they could.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	Rosenfels isn't a bad QB, I thought he actually played better than Matt Schaub. I think he'll be a good fit in Minnesota.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	They really don't care about the quarterback position, do they?|`|F2OQVXRtaa	This isn't perhaps the most brilliant move but it certainly seems an upgrade. The west-coast offense benefits with a high completion percentage QB. Sage has averaged 62% in his career with 64-69% in the last three seasons. He's done that with most defenses playing pass coverage (because, really, did Houston have a run game?). Compare that with T-Jacks 58% (at best) and you get part of the picture. Add to this the fact that Sage has been sacked only 16 times in 32 games over the past three years (compared with T-Jack's 41 times in 25 games) and you get another part of the picture. To be completely honest, I don't know if Sage is a better game-manager than Gus but he seems a better option than T-Jack in most areas. And Sage is 7 years younger than Gus. So, he's younger and more mobile than Gus (who was sacked 40 times in the last 19 games) with the same completion percentage (aka: good game management). Definitely better completion percentage than T-Jack. The Vikings will not get Cassell (bad blood with Belichick), McNabb (Eagles aren't that dumb), nor do they want Garcia (older than Gus, questions of durability, etc). If you know a better QB out there that the Vikings can get please let me know...but considering they just need someone to NOT screw up--Sage is a decent choice. Let's not forget, people, Trent Dilfer has a Superbowl ring (and we all know why)!|`|sCOg8O1maa	Sage isn't a bad QB... not a great one, but not a bad one.<br>  <br>  It's sometime better to get a veteran that is less than great as a backup as opposed to on old overpaid has-been or a young unproven fixer-upper.<br>  <br>  I don't consider it a bad deal, considering the Vikings unstable QB situation.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	they traded for him n will get rid of gus frerrotte he has performed decent in houston look for him to do better in a west coast offense|`|AA10611307	what does it matter who you put back there if hes just gonna hand off|`|ENBhz7Asaa	Hey, he's better than what you had last year isn't he?|`|XnbcCgboaa	Jackson will probably start, with Sage being the backup I would imagine since Frerotte is kinda old, even though Gus played pretty good this year.
GpzvrlHdaa	Pushing less mass results in less recoil.  Pushing it faster results in more recoil, but the lighter bullet will kick less because its speed won't make up for that much mass.  Recoil will be only slightly sharper if you match speed with 243 100 grain bullets using 100 grain bullets in the .270.  This is a great load for varmints, and with the heavier bullets the 270 is also a very good choice for most big game.   J|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, besides a 270 has a moderate rather than a violent recoil anyway.* The Recoil Energy of a 270 is only 17.0.*.. The recoil energy of a 7mm Ultra-Magnum is 29.4.*..The recoil energy of a 243 is only 8.8.*..|`|H4dswqRlaa	The 100 grain 243 bullet is a controlled expansion big game hunting bullet. The 100 grain 270 bullet is a highly explosive varmint bullet. One must not use a varmint bullet in the 270 for big game hunting. <br>  <br>  Back in the mid-20th Century, worship of the 30-06 was in it's heyday! Having won two world wars by itself, or so it seemed from hearing good-ole-boys bluster about it, the honor of blowing half the meat away from deer was ceremoniously cast upon the anointed 30-06 shooters. The 30-30 shooters sat quietly by, lest they be accused of lack of patriotism. Then one gunwriter got knocked on his butt once too often by a 30-06, from shooting in typically loose footing exactly where it will complicate things the most. Jack O'Connor set about publicizing the 130 grain big game hunting bullet load in the 270 Winchester (a necked-down to .277" bore 30-06 case), as being fine for elk and at significantly less recoil than typical 30-06 loads. Bottom line on that was if you needed to shoot an escaping elk in the butt, a 150 grain bullet would more likely penetrate up to the vitals, but otherwise the 130 grainer was fine. Just as many hunters praised my old friend Jack O'Connor, as hung him in effigy on the pages of gun magazines, most notably my other old friend, Elmer Keith. I liked my 243 and my bolt-action 45-70 equally, so I had no friction with either of them. My decision which to use depended upon range, size of game, and any need for brush busting. <br>  <br>  One popular 270 load for ordinary deer at close woods ranges for people who still thought the 130 grain 270 load was still a bit much, used to be 43 grains of IMR-4064 and a cartridge overall length of 3.180", for about 2700 fps, and 2100 ft-lb of muzzle energy. This duplicated a Swedish Mauser load, certainly proven in the deer woods on the European version of elk, and therefore plenty for deer! And a lot easier on the shoulder than a full-power 270 load, which frankly, a lot of folks still think is more than one needs to put up with, particularly 30-30 shooters! Regards, Larry.|`|YdOfpXkoaa	there is not that much recoil in a 270 its just the way you put it positioned i started with the 270 at 10 years i will recommend you a weatherby

It will help to increase bone density which can be lost in the pool since you are not using all of your body weight, and to strengthen your muscles even more.

blSlwcIiaa	Better Toe Touch: <br>  <br>  There are 3 things to remember when practicing your toe touch - flexibility, height, and technique! All are important and I will give you some exercises and things to practice to improve your toe touch: <br>  <br>  A.) flexibility - 1st start stretching in a straddle sit. Then have someone push on your back to assist with your stretching. <br>  Exercise 1.) For some exercises, lay flat on your back with your hands underneath your buttocks. Keep your back on the ground and legs together, pull your legs up off the ground. Start separating your legs as you come up and eventually snap a toe touch. If you can touch your toes to the ground then you flexibility is excellent. Then on the way down bring your legs together and lay your heels back on the ground. Do this 10 times for 3 sets. <br>  Exercise 2.) Lay flat on your back with your arms straight above your head and your legs together. Start by using your abs and pull your arms down through your legs. At the same time snap a straddle snap (toe touch). Do this 10 times for 3 sets. <br>  <br>  B.) Height - Now start working on your jump and improve your height. It will give you enough time to snap your legs up and bring them back down without bending them and loosing your balance. <br>  Exercise 1.) Find some bleachers and/or a chair. Stand in front with both feet together on the ground. Now jump straight up on the chair/bleachers, and then back off. Do this for 30 seconds non stop for 2-3sets. This will increase your jumping ability. <br>  Exercise 2.) Have a spotter stand behind you and grab your waist. On count execute you jump. Have the spotter help lift you off the ground (just a little). This will give you the idea of what it's supposed to feel like to hit the correct height on the toe touch. <br>  <br>  C.) Technique - Know how to throw the toe touch. <br>  1.) Keep your chest up. Too many girls drop their chest and it actually makes the jump look lower than it should. <br>  2.) Do not touch your toes...kick your legs behind your arms. If you touch you toes, then it reduces the height of your jump. <br>  3.) Straight legs up and on the way down for the landing. Make sure you do not bend your legs on the way up or down. You will loose points for tryouts. <br>  4.) Land with your feet together. <br>  5.) Keep your toes pointed <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Better backhandspring: <br>  <br>  Exercise 1.)Let's start with the snap down. Start in a handstand (it does not have to be perfect) and snap your feet to the ground by pushing off with your shoulders and using your abs. Your hands should leave the ground before your feet hit. Land with your feet together and lift your chest in order to bring your arms straight up. After you have snapped your feet down, finish by jumping up. Do this about 10 times in a row. It will make your shoulders and your abs stronger. It will also make it easier to finsh your backhandspring.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Exercise 2.)Get a GOOD spotter. Start with your feet together and hands to your side. Have your spotter place their hands in a spotting position (if on your left side - spotter place right hand on mid back and left hand on back of thigh). NOw throw a backhandspring and when you finish step forward and throw another. Do 5 in a row and the spotter will help you out if you get tired. This Exercise will not only make you feel more comfortable about the backhandspring, but will improve your strength in your legs. You will start throwing your backhandsprings a lot easier the next day or 2 after.|`|LeJ6Uu3raa	ya i agree with these people. im not in cheer but i take a tumbling class and ive been doing it for about 3 weeks once a week and im gonna start working on my front flip  on the ground. believe me it helps a lot|`|vrgsenkNaa	to make tumbling much better and easier for you. try going to a gymnastics gym near you. take a tumbling class. that should help|`|B4HtgUnKaa	go to a tumbling class at a competitive league cheerleading place!

I understand securing the weapon under certain circumstances, but why are you unloading it when you secure it? I ran into the problem a few times of having to secure my weapon before I entered the jail to deliver a prisoner etc, but I invested in a small handgun safe that secures in the trunk with bolts. just remove the loaded firearm, place in the safe, close it, close the trunk and go. Return to the car, open the trunk, remove and secure firearm and go.

I also keep some emergency cash in there as well.<br>  shoot safe.|`|AEzJHIz7aa	Putting a wooden dowel (or anything else) in the cavity is a bad idea.  HPs depend on fluid pressure to expand.  If the cavity is plugged, that can't happen.  The same thing can happen if you shoot thru drywall.  The drywall fills the cavity, then the bullet becomes a non-expanding round.<br>  <br>    I've been part of experiments with this, where we placed a stack of wet phone books behind various barriers to see what effect there was on expansion and penetration.  And, universally, if there bullet went thru something else first (paneling, drywall, a dry phone book, cardboard) the round failed to expand and would penetrate deeper than when fired directly into the wet phine book.  It was a real eye-opener.<br>  <br>  If you intend to plug that cavity as a way to prevent damage, you'd do just as well to put a round of ball ammo first on the magazine.

vYAgIMLdaa	I believe the fourth paragraph answers your question:<br>  <br>  Intentional grounding is a penalty in football in which the quarterback throws the ball away to avoid being hit by a defensive player. In the NFL, the penalty for intentional grounding is generally a 10-yard loss and a loss of down, but it can change depending on where the quarterback is positioned when he throws the ball.<br>  <br>  If the quarterback is more than 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage when he commits an intentional grounding penalty, the ball is placed at the yard line from which he threw the ball. This still results in a loss of down. If the quarterback is in his own end zone when he commits an intentional grounding penalty, the result is a safety, which awards two points to the defensive team. The offensive team then must kick the ball back to the defensive team.<br>  <br>  A quarterback can avoid an intentional grounding penalty in a number of ways. If there is an eligible receiver in the area where the ball is thrown, there is no intentional grounding. An eligible receiver must typically be a wide receiver, running back or tight end, and he must have at least a reasonable chance to catch the pass in order to negate the penalty.<br>  <br>  The quarterback is also allowed to throw the ball away, depending on where he is on the field. There is an imaginary area that extends between the offensive tackles -- the two outermost members of the offensive line, excluding the tight end -- and backward infinitely from the line of scrimmage in which intentional grounding is not allowed. This area is commonly referred to as the "pocket." If the quarterback scrambles laterally beyond the left or right tackle, or outside of the pocket, he can then throw the ball away without being penalized for intentional grounding. The throw must at least reach the line of scrimmage, regardless of whether an eligible receiver is nearby.<br>  <br>  The logic behind the penalty applied to intentional grounding is this: What would have happened if the quarterback had not thrown the ball? Most penalties result in the negation of the play, meaning that if a penalty happens on first down, the team loses yards but the down remains first.<br>  <br>  Intentional grounding, though, is done to avoid a sack, and if a sack had occurred, the team would have lost both the yards and the down. A sack on third down leads to fourth. Hence the penalty for intentional grounding includes a loss of down. Also, if a sack had occurred in the end zone, the result would be a safety. Such is the penalty for intentional grounding in the end zone.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Draw a line backwards from the tackles at the start of the play. Inside of those lines is the "pocket". As long as the QB is outside those lines when he throws the ball away, he is outside the pocket.<br>  <br>  Note: Those lines don't shift with the line during the play.|`|gUgzg81oaa	it is when the QB is inside tackles also knows as the tackle box.|`|goe3y4FPaa	JAMARCUS RUSELL AND BRADY QUINN  ITS LIKE THE HULK AND SUPERMAN

mJFgCvYlaa	Yes, like all others, asking your local shop if there are any clubs. There are also some clubs on yahoo, and meetup.com<br>  <br>  See the link below, I'm member of the Denver Road Cycling club and there are plenty of different group rides, and its all free! <br>  <br>  There are also different levels of riding clubs, so be sure to ask them before joining. They might even have easy, "smell the roses" rides. I'm trying to lead some of the beginners in our group, so every ride we do will have some details on the difficulty, pace, and surroundings. Everyone has a really good time and expect riders of all ages.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Well, the way I did it was to show up on group rides.  As others have stated, check with your local bike shop.  They know about rides, some have weekend rides, and they have free publications advertising rides.<br>  <br>  It's great to get to know fellow riders and have cycling friends.  Socializing while riding helps melt the miles away.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	You can try yahoo groups and see if there's anything in your area. Or try craigslist and click on where it says bikes.At the top right of the page there are listings for local groups. I wouldn't just join a group on the street.Some of these aren't open to new people.There's cliques that want to stay that way.Just like kids at school who move off into there own little group outside of class.|`|lCPQNlWoaa	You could get some of your current friends to ride. Depending on what kind of bike you ride you could make friends that way too. If you BMX you could go to a park and find someone. If you like riding for exercise you could google and look for a marathon in your area. It just depends on what kind of bike you ride, the reasonyou ride it, and the area your in. A BMXer isn't going to ride 5 miles just for fun usually. Post another question with more detail.|`|pMtMsbBnaa	Are there any bike shops in your city?  Stop in or call them to find out if they organize some kind of club/group.  The one in my city gets people together to ride like once a week.  Or google "bikeathon" in your area to find out if there are any bikeathons coming up this summer.  You can spend a day or two riding with other bike-loving people  :)|`|jAChLnalaa	Join a club, or ask at a bike shop if there are organized weekly rides anywhere in your vicinity.
wbIEau0qaa	LA will get the Vikigns in 2 years after the Vikings lose AD to a season ending injury, and the vikings follow the lions in going 0-16|`|wxXguyK3aa	Yeah, LA should get one.  But I think it would be easier to move a team there, like the Jets.  Why have two teams playing in the same stadium.  <br>  All the division are even right now (4 in each) so a new team would mess that up.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	If there is an NFL expansion Los Angeles would be the city to get a team, but I dont think there should be an expansion, 32 teams is enough and its good the way it is now|`|MPDgKgIxaa	The NFL is looking to get a team playing in Canada.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <a href="http://americanfootballpredictions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...</a>|`|JTSNljLhaa	California have to many teams already,so i hope not LA<br>  its possible that the Bills will move up to Toronto|`|ProDw5xAaa	No time soon. If LA gets a team, it will most likely be the Vikings or Chargers or Raiders.|`|AA11369268	I don't think there will be any expansion teams for a few years just because of the economy.  Governor Schwarzenegger is pushing to get a team in L.A. and he wants a new stadium there as well, but it's not clear whether or not he will put that on the top of his list of things to do because of the economy.<br>  <br>  Also, it's not clear whether the new team would be an expansion team or a team that moved because it was in a smaller market.  If it were an expansion team, they might add a few more in order to even out the divisions, but it would more likely be a team from a different city.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :-)|`|0MJRD9sYaa	For the other people answering....the Jets are not going to move from New York to California. That's all the way across the country. Also, has anyone heard about the recession. In this economy, there can't be anymore expansion teams.|`|oNLM1TNjaa	It'd be nice to get a team up here in Canada, eh?  The CFL isnt worth watching and the Bills coming here twice a year isn't much better.  Just give us a team in Toronto and stick 'em in the NFC North.
95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	Do it at home in the UK. There are many reasons for this.<br>   You're going to be learning in a relatively difficult environment. This is actually good. It will make you a better, safer diver and able to dive just about anywhere in just about any conditions. You'll be comfortable everywhere. Your local Instructors will make sure you're fine with everything. You'll learn more too.<br>    If you do the resort course, you'll be comfortable only diving is nice cozy environments and if anything that challenges that pops up, you'll be a little unprepared. Learning cold and low vis makes diving warm seem like a walk in the park and you're still good to go at home.<br>   Then there's that little thing called vacation time. Do you want to be spending as much as half your vacation in a classroom or in water class or would you rather be spending it diving? Learn at home and you could be getting wet on a charter boat mere hours after getting to Cyprus .<br>   Then there's the Instruction itself. Resort courses aren't famed for being comprehensive. They're after the tourist money. Get them certified quickly and out the door because they don't have to see you again is usually what it's about. Learning at home, on the other hand, and if you're not happy about something, you're right on their doorstep. They have to take care of you since they'll be seeing you often. They like having students alive, healthy, happy and bringing their wallets into the dive shop. It's good business.<br>   Speaking of business, you're keeping that money you spend on the course in the local economy and not in another country.<br>   Lastly, if you ask around locally, you'll find that divers trained in the UK or any cold water environment, tend to avoid warm water certified divers like the plague, given a choice. There's nothing worse than paying a dive charter, being saddled with a warm water cert and have them abort the dive because they don't know how to put on a mask when wearing a hood or they freak out and bolt to the surface because they just found out what a thermocline feels and looks like. Little things, not major ones that you'll learn at home as part of a normal dive course, yet are not taught at warm water destinations even though it may be the same agency doing the certifying.|`|2xpzhN5faa	Wait till you get there.<br>  I went diving there and its beautiful :)<br>  Always brilliant to do diving abroad than here <br>  UK is awful for diving to be fair, terrible visibility.<br>  So do it in cyprus. <br>  :)
B46t8gkLaa	fantasy sports withitn yahoo doesn't generally have a budget. you have to get more in depth for all of that...
r5AMG8g7aa	$75.00 a month is cheap. Assuming that the training is good go for it. As for your comment about the instructor being in the hall of fame, anyone can be in the hall of fame. There are a many of them. They are mostly con games. They contact martial artists and tell them that they have been nominated for an award. Then if you are willing to pay the high fees, you get inducted into the Hall of fame. I get 3-5 offers every years to be in one of these. They always want me to pay a large fee to be inducted. Some Award.  Do your own research on the instructor. If he is legit, you should be able to verify his background with the Kyokushinkai-Kan.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	yes we pay 79.00 mo for three days a week, but you can come three hours a day if you want.<br>  if you sign for a two or three yr contract it goes down.|`|AA10976536	I'd say a qualified "yes" - $75 a month is on the lower edge of low. 100-120 a month is probably average, with 120-150 being "high". (Personally, I pay $150 a month for my Escrima lessons, and I think it's worth it, but that's the outer limit for me.)<br>  <br>  HOWEVER - check to see what the hidden fees are, including:<br>  <br>  1. Belt tests - a lot of schools require that you pay for these: anything from 50-200 each. If you just think if this averaged out over every 6 months or so it's not a real big deal, but you should be aware of it. Check to see how often belt tests occur: again, if you do one in the first six months, then one a year after that, it's probably OK. Any more and it sounds like you're being milked. <br>  <br>  2. Seminar costs - a lot of schools give these out as well. If they're optional training it's fine, but if you find yourself "needing" to go to the seminar to learn the system, watch out. Usually if seminars are once a quarter, you should be OK. Again, look for a cost between 80-150 a piece.<br>  <br>  3. Equipment fees - Most places require that you buy workout clothes there: the gi, basically. That's probably OK. If they require that you spend $200 on all the official gear from the offical dojo store, that's a warning sign.<br>  <br>  4. Long-term contracts: I'm guessing this place probably doesn't have them, but if they do, look out. Go for the monthly rate to start, and if you like it enough then shift to the quarterly one. Year-long contracts are probably not in your best interest, as inevitably there will be a month or so that you can't go for whatever reason (vacation, illness, schoolwork, etc.) <br>  <br>  With all those in mind, the TCO (Total cost of ownership) for being in a dojo can probably tack on an addition $100 a month. So make sure you understand their pricing scheme before you commit to anything.
GJLjNk5Waa	Usually, yes|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  I didn't.  I took the training class and jumped with a static line.|`|u9Cn9n6baa	yes|`|klOP21xTaa	PJ is right, you can do a static line jump course, this involves jumping like a paratrooper from 800m, this involves the chute deploying virtually immediately, then you float to the deck, happens very quickly, you can then do your skydiving qualification, all the way upto doing HALO/ HAHO jumps that you see the navy seals doing, this involves jumping on O2 from around 20/ 30 thousand feet, this is the longest freefall you will ever be able to do, 30,000 feet involves a freefall of 2 minutes and hypoxia is not uncommon at these altitudes, meaning that if you do not do the pre 02 breathing you can black out and not pull the cord, but all that is a while away even if you want to do it, good luck.|`|U9cLxjUjaa	Depends on where you jump.<br>  <br>  Most places do require it, but some places will let you do a solo with a training class that usually takes a few hours, or some places are just plane (get it, plane haha, nevermind) crazy and will let you do anything.|`|FPsR2xi7aa	Usually, yes.<br>  <br>  Unless you buy all your own equipment, including the plane.<br>  <br>  The rules vary from state to state and from country to country.  And I'm pretty sure if you're trained in the armed forces, they don't bother with a tandem jump.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	the first time i went was in france. they made me do a tandem jump. here in NC, they also made me do a tandem jump. i guess maybe it depends on where you go (?)|`|AA11452335	You can actually take an accelerated course before you jump so that you can go alone but with two instructors jumping with you.  That is what I found out when I went my first time.  All you have to do is call the place you want to jump at and ask about their accelerated course.
hEpL5MsWaa	Squat jumps 3 sets of 25 reps : Squat down at 90 degrees explode up as quickly and highly as possible, repeat<br>  <br>  side to side jumps - as fast and how many you can do<br>  <br>  depth jumps: Start ontop of a box about 2 feet high, step down and explode up as high as possible as soon as you hit the ground. 3 sets of 6<br>  <br>  jumping rope<br>  <br>  calf raises- stand against a wall and lift your toes up as high as possible, go down and repeat<br>  <br>  box jumps, keep jumping ontop and off of a box as many times as possible<br>  <br>  good luck!

geih5vR8aa	Year round, but the best is generally from April to October. The fishing is best in the spring, when the fish move into the bay to spawn, and early summer.<br>  <br>  The fish spawn in relatively shallow water from April through July.
gUMucKOkaa	You would have the top players at those two positions. Obviously as you realize, you would be limited in filling the remainder of your roster. Frankly, this is not my favorite type of league. I don't know about next year, but I think that I would keep them both this year.<br>  <br>  Votto for 1 is a steal. I would also keep Soria, Bruce, Hamels, maybe Fuentes.<br>  <br>  For 2B look at Felipe Lopez, he should be cheap. Perhaps Chris Ianetta is also. <br>  <br>  Two new guys that I would price (well, maybe Price also) would be Chris Davis and Pablo Sandoval.<br>  <br>  Ubaldo Jimenez, Kershaw, and Liriano might be cheap SPs to grab.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Who would go after taker if they did do it, Hacksaw Jim Duggan Lol.<br>  <br>  And also IMO I think they shouldn't have anyone beat him at Wrestlemania. Because I just don't like the Idea of Takers near 2 decades building up his streak then ending it and making the records say 16-1.|`|U3KAgO0baa	Taker will NOT retire thais year IMO, and I'm going 2 get A LOT of thumbs down for this, BUT I Truly think that Takers Streak(and Career) will end at WM26 against Ted DiBiase Jr.<br>  Which IMO makes a TON of Sense seeing how Ted Sr. was the man who brought Taker in to the WWE. (storyline wise at least)|`|zNajmAYFaa	Why do you could talking about him and Shawn Michaels retiring? Look at Sting he's about to be 50. Why cant they retire at 50? They have a long time before they'll retire. Notice how the last 4 matchess of the year have included Michaels? He has a long time. He's still in his prime!|`|BCyTD7nIaa	Undertaker actually has a no loss at mania stipulation in his contract so keep dreaming
BEgSXcZaaa	That's not a bad 40 yd time for JUCO.  It really depends on what position your trying out for, with your size and speed I would move you to Fullback or Outside linebacker.  Also remember you can be as fast as lighting, but heart and skill is what determines how good you will be on the field.  Other things like Leadership, Learning Ability, and Reaction time are just as important.  Really work on Explosive lifts and Plyometrics drills to help your time.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	For your height and weight I'd say below average.

Compare that to Iginla...wait, there's no comparison.<br>  <br>  Iginla is the epitome of what captain is and should be.  A leader of men.

Iginla is a/thee premiere power forward.<br>  <br>   Comparing face-offs is laughable.<br>  <br>   Put Iginla on the Wings......better PP numbers........100 points every season......+40 every season!<br>  <br>   Put Datsyuk on the Flames.......70 points....less PP points.......probably +10 if that......<br>  <br>   Heart is another quality.......intangibles. Size. Strength. <br>  <br>  <br>   Sometimes you just need to look at it with common sense.<br>  <br>   A good example...........<br>  <br>   Rod BrindAmour is better on face-offs than Alex Ovechkin<br>   Rod BrindAmour is a better leader than Ovechkin<br>   Rod BrindAmour is better defensively than Ovechkin<br>   Ovechkin leads the NHL in giveaways<br>   Rod BrindAmour is a better passer than Ovechkin<br>   Rod BrindAmour is a better fighter than Ovechkin<br>   Rod BrindAmour is a better penalty killer than Ovechkin<br>  <br>   ^^^^ All of this is true (especially if you flash back 2 years) so is BrindAmour better than Ovechkin? No. Sometimes you just need common sense.<br>  <br>   Edit- You seem to be picking and choosing your arguments......you reply to the fact that Iginla gets more ice time than Datsyuk yet neglect to comment on the example (BrindAmour) I provided.<br>  <br>   Datsyuk has become a very good player (bit of a late blossomer) but he is no Iginla.....the biggest proof is in just watching the game......throw all the numbers/what teams they play for and whatnot out the window...what you are left with is that Iginla is better........as is Lecavalier....as is Crosby.....as is Ovechkin.......as is Thornton.<br>  <br>   Datsyuk is very good both offensively and defensively.......if you want to know what kind of player he is comparably speaking......he is somewhere  between a Rod BrindAmour (but he's craftier) and a Sergei Fedorov (whom he he is not quite as good as...talking in his prime).<br>  <br>   Actually..........Fedorov is another prime example........as I said he I think he was better than Datsyuk BUT perhaps seeing he was a Wing will help you see the light.<br>  <br>   Let's say Peter Forsberg was the best player of the 90's (as central scouting probably had him there more than anyone else....guessing)......OK Although it may have been Jagr!<br>  <br>  <br>   Fedorov was faster, better defensively, better on the PK, better on face-offs yada yada yada.........<br>  <br>   BUT.........who was the better player in the 90's? Fedorov or Forsberg?<br>  <br>   Perhaps I should not use this example because you probably think Fedorov was (when in fact.......he was not top 5 IMO).......another perfect example!<br>  <br>   Datsyuk isn't the games best all around player. It's easy to tell by watching the game. Take off the blinders!|`|1a18a7a889b915031fe2a7c2d1631d62aa	Something you failed to mention, Datsyuk plays on a better team(the Red Wings) than Iginla (Flames) and is surrounded by better players. Iginla is able to create these statistics with a weaker talent base. I am not trying to take anything away from Datsyuk, being a Blackhawks fan I know first hand how talented he is. But an argument can be made against Datsyuk just because of who he plays with.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	Honestly, you cant go wrong with either player. The problem I have with Iginla is the lack of discipline and restraint. He takes dumb penalties, out of frustration, in turn hurting his team. I have never really been a fan of Iginla, but I don't really care for the Flames either.|`|jRRTdT4uaa	iginla is arround better players|`|lYnkvRASaa	You are comparing apples to oranges. One datsyuk is a center the other is a RW.  The center better be the better face-off guy.<br>  <br>  They are both great players, Iginla has been around longer playing at a high level so that counts in their rankings.<br>  <br>  Iginla is a goal scorer, datsyuk is a playmaker, generally we put more value on goals.<br>  <br>  Both are great players but Iginla brings a bit more to the table.  Datsyuk has been an elite player for 3 seasons, Iginla has been around a bit longer.<br>  <br>  Right now if I had to chose one I might pick Datsyuk because he is younger.<br>  <br>  Edit : well said leafsfan!!!|`|8qH5q7TGaa	Iginla is just a great leader and does all the things you need him to do. Hitting doesn't matter for a scorer like Datsyuk or Iginlia and neither does fighting. Iginla just has a proven track record and he is very solid year in and year out and has been doing it for a while, he just plays on a team that nobody pays attention to so most fans don't think he's that good.

You certainly made this a tough one. I was just looking at LW's and I saw that this one was going to take some serious thought.<br>  <br>  LW- You made this one very hard. You got Nash, Semin, and Parise not to mention both Versteeg and Vanek are both very talented players. Personally, I would take Rick Nash. He isn't that old of a guy yet he has already made a name for himself. He has done wonders in Columbus and nearly every season he has arguably the goal of the year. Anyways, he is a consistent player who is still youthful and is an asset to Columbus and he would be to any other team.<br>  <br>  C- Mike Richards. It's short and simple. This guy is the captain in Philly after only a few years ago, Philly was the Bottom Dweller in the Eastern Conference. He is 16th in the league for points and he may not be one of the league leaders in goals, but him being on the line with Jeff Carter has made Carter blossom in his scoring. Only Ovie has more goals then Carter. Richards is a 100% team leader AND team player.<br>  <br>  RW- Ales Hemsky. Again, it's simple. This young guy is doing wonders for Edmonton right now. Another team that hasn't been doing the greatest over the years.<br>  <br>  D- Green: An offensive defenseman is always a must have when you are looking at a solid defensive pairing.<br>  Phaneuf: Very physical player, who is a solid blue-liner and he can set up Green for the goals.<br>  <br>  G- Chris Mason: First of all, Price has been flimsy and Rask is just a rookie.<br>  Chris Mason is doing amazing for Columbus and would be an incredible have for any team.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	LW - Parise<br>  C - Richards<br>  RW - Kane<br>  D - Green<br>  D - Phanuef<br>  G - Mason|`|F934e4HQaa	LW)Zach Parise<br>  <br>  C)Jeff Carter<br>  <br>  RW)Patrick Kane<br>  <br>  D)Mike Geen  Dion Phanuef<br>  <br>  G)Steve Mason<br>  <br>  mostly because their all young but talented

At least for now.<br>  <br>  Even though I've only been watching football for about four years now, I do know that Joe Montana and Unitas were better than he was.

It's only a temporary thing, not permanent.|`|8mH9j825aa	who said we all agreed? i definetly dont.  if brady had not gone down i think thered be more support but cassell shown what he can do in the patriots system and that takes loads of credibility away from him.

After he beats Thales and Okami, he may fight but two more contenders before retiring, thank god one of them maybe Maia, because otherwise Henderson might have the only good chance so far for dethroning Silva.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	UFC is a competition, MMA is a fighting discipline.<br>  <br>  This is like asking who is the better soldier, an American or a US Marine.|`|nRBC4E5saa	UFC fighters are MMA fighters.<br>  <br>  MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) is the sport.  The UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championships) is a promotional company.<br>  <br>  That's like asking who's better, NBA players or basketball players.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	MMA.<br>  <br>  E
6JiUrQOHaa	Johnny Bench|`|sOTlV8Scaa	First off Pujols probably takes roids too so thats a stupid answer.  if you want to go by stats the Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio were both great players|`|YbztFmITaa	Babe Ruth.|`|27fCHzeZaa	kirby puckett|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Don't make me choose between George Brett and Dan Quisenberry.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Paul Molitor - First Brewer I admired and followed as a kid.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Carl Yastrzemski.|`|AA11588942	Ted Williams|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Ted Williams|`|AA10095350	Peter Edward Rose!|`|5lIEEAUkaa	Jeff DaVanon. <br>  I was a bat boy for the Angels in Spring Training and he was the nicest out of all. He gave me a helmet and we talked video games. Haha|`|X9fo1IkKaa	Derek Jeter but Donnie Baseball is a close second.|`|0BRnovJYaa	Mike Piazza!|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Carl Yastrzemski|`|B46t8gkLaa	Albert Pujols. when they take away bonds mvp's pujols will have the most.|`|gaOSUthbaa	Lou Gehrig|`|vuh0i3Axaa	ken griffey jr...|`|rv7rzYMlaa	A - ROD F.U. all haters to him
TBu2iaPaaa	rey|`|wMh38OzVaa	Your kidding right?aww Ray Mysterio|`|8t1Osybyaa	that would be boring,t rey would win|`|yEsw7UkWaa	It would be a classic that Vinnie Mac could re sell years later. (I jest!)<br>  Rey would win, Hornswaggle doesn't seem to be that great a talent in the ring...|`|JmK3Bgdyaa	that seems interesting.LOL.if that happens I bet u Finlay will come out.<br>  Rey Mysterio,DUH!!:P|`|HnOIAdTYaa	well unless your stupid,<br>  you would know that<br>  REY WOULD WIN.|`|qwdh7N6saa	HORNswoggle|`|SogDSfygaa	uh rey obiously
2wgEsVmsaa	Oh, heck yes. Any team should want him. I'd gamble on 3 or even 4 years. What the hey. Did he slow down any last year? Nyet!|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Yes.  And I think the Dodgers are an inch away from signning him.<br>  <br>  Go Dodgers!!!!!|`|KTp27Fokaa	Manny, Dye, and Quentin would be the slowest outfield of all time.|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Absolutely not.  He's a quitter.  He only tries when he feels like it.|`|u33v3FE9aa	i would only sign him for only 1 year..thats it|`|tA5DrAPpaa	No, the Yankees need some youth.|`|rv7rzYMlaa	no yankees dont need him he wants a long contract so its hard to get rid of him until his contract is up so he can slack off and disrespect his teamates|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Nope.  I liked this guy until he quit last year on the Sox.  I wouldn't welcome anybody who behaves that way on my team.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Been there done that.|`|B46t8gkLaa	YES. put him in a cardinals uniform.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	No, because he slacks off a lot. He wants a long term deal so he could put it in cruise, again.|`|sBrYcT5daa	Absolutely not, I am glad the Red Sox got rid of him!|`|l88pj0NUaa	No. We got rid of him last season. We don't need him back. Jason Bay is way better.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Yep. Coletti really needs to get that deal done.|`|AA10263761	Yes i dont really understand why people are so afraid of him.<br>  Are you afraid the guy is going to hit 40 Hr with a .335 ba<br>  I Would love for the yankees to sign him|`|gaOSUthbaa	No. The Nats already have a crowded outfield. Manny might contribute homers, but fielding is a huge concern.|`|6JiUrQOHaa	Oh hell yes.<br>  <br>  The Mets are a lock for the NL pennant with Manny in the lineup.  But it's not gonna happen and it makes me sad.|`|nRIREXjRaa	I would love for my team to have manny but not for the amount of years he wants.  I say 2 years then see about more after|`|goxJtV3aaa	No...id rather have Bay, between fielding and locker room presence Bay is a better fit for the Sox
LdJFFvSVaa	If you can make sh!t decisions your halfway there mate|`|nJ5kceMBaa	If you're fit and fully able, weight shouldn't be an issue unless you're illegally discriminated against (which is obviously very common). If you feel as though you would want to take refereeing seriously, losing weight is pretty much a must - players aren't going to take you seriously if you're overweight.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't worry about it during the course. It really shouldn't be an issue =)
xRPjgGs1aa	Try looking in local areas|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Certainly living next to Carl Erskine means you get an automatic pass to the Majors.<br>  <br>  Amazing. Just amazing.|`|YbztFmITaa	Contact the St. Paul Saints in Minnesota.
zjpB2GARaa	Of course he will should be a 1st round pick (if he was still at Oklahoma, Sam Bradford would be a first year starter), but he was victimized by the hypocritical NCAA.  The NCAA's unAmerican rulebook prohibits athletes from making money off of their abilities and actually pretends that athletes are attending college to learn (even though every intelligent person knows that most blue-chip athletes are attending college merely because the pro leagues are too cheap to develop their own talent and because the colleges want to make alot of money by exploiting these athletes).  Thanks to the National Communist Athletic Association, somebody is going to get a steal.|`|RS3fjNboaa	OU came out of that with barely a slap on the wrist. Bomar is the one that got the shaft. I think he'll do fine in the NFL. Don't listen to the OU whiners.<br>  <br>  BS! They conveniently "caught" it when the heat was coming down on them. Bob Stoops is just another Pete Carroll. he pays his players well.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	yea he is probably the 6th best qb he has done well this off season although the emergence of pat white isn't good for him he is helped by nate davis' terrible off season|`|acaAycEXaa	That azzhole caused too many problems at OU. Probably cost us a couple of National Championships. Screw him!<br>  <br>  Bevo-<br>  Oklahoma did NOTHING wrong! It was them who caught Bomar's violation, not the NCAA!|`|bc7HMUSUaa	He did a lot to ruin Bob Stoops and the Sooners credibility. I don't have any respect for him.
obPSaYf3aa	In the Midwest, the best program is Wichita State University (Sean Rash, Chris Barnes, notable alumni), in the West, I'd have to say San Jose State University (Kim Terrell Canady, Tony Reyes, notable alumni).  Back East, I'm not sure, but you can check bowl.com for information on collegiate bowling teams there.  Good luck!|`|TD9Ew3MZaa	Wichita State University <br>  University of Nebraska <br>  New Jersey City University <br>  Vanderbilt University
Wz2lTWJ3aa	This is the football section. Your question should be worded, “How would Brett Favre keep a paper parallel in word?”<br>  <br>  And the answer is Format->Paragraph->Alignment->Justified|`|s9Pwnb87aa	?, you making a playbook?
ZAh8CEoGaa	Chris Paul.|`|KTp27Fokaa	ur mom is a MILF|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Wow you're cool.<br>  <br>  Kb24 4 life - Ignore the haters. They suck. Most of them are probably the same person anyways.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	wow..ur still at it, huh? LMFAO<br>  <br>  lame assssss<br>  <br>  <br>  i like mugsy!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: i know..this person has been doing this to me for 3 days now. i have had an on going migraine lol<br>  <br>  thanks =)|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	well if ur talkin about height?????Mugsy Bouges wins. But as a skilled player,CP3 wins. 20+points,10+ast,5+rbs.<br>  come on........................
95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	What you're probably referring to is what's called a full face communicator set. A full face mask with an integrated reg and a transceiver. Yes, you can talk with either other divers or to the surface with most of the rigs on the market these days.<br>   As for talking with another diver using a normal, run of the mill, reg set, yes. You actually can. You're muffled and some of the consonants don't sound right, but it's understandable. Try saying the letter "P" with a straw in your mouth. Then you'll understand it takes a little listening and figuring out, what the other diver is saying. Some things like " Slow down" can easily be said and understood on the other hand. It's rare that a diver will resort to this though, as we tend to use hand signals for the most part, but verbal comms is handy if the other diver is out of sight but nearby.|`|2xpzhN5faa	It's not a regulator.<br>  It's a mask, with a regulator in it that you don't have to put your mouth around so that you can talk at the same time as breathing.<br>  Very expensive which is why normal divers won't use them, but on tele they do.
