Because:<br>  <br>  "A rotating reference frame can have advantages over an inertial reference frame.[15][4] Sometimes the calculations are simpler (an example is inertial circles), and sometimes the intuitive picture coincides more closely with the rotational frame (an example is sedimentation in a centrifuge). By treating the extra acceleration terms due to the rotation of the frame as if they were forces, subtracting them from the physical forces, it's possible to treat the second time derivative of position (relative to the rotating frame) as if it was the absolute acceleration. Thus the analysis using Newton's law can proceed as if the reference frame was inertial, provided the fictitious force terms are included in the sum of forces. For example, centrifugal force is used in the FAA pilot's manual in describing turns.[16] Other examples are such systems as planets, centrifuges, carousels, turning cars, spinning buckets, and rotating space stations."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal...</a><br>  <br>  A.  cercumference = pi * D = 3.14 * 100 m = 314.16 meters<br>  <br>  v = d/t = 314.16/60 = 5.24 m/s<br>  <br>  B.

goKfNeeOaa	In order to understand the diurnal temperature fluctuation of Mercury, you've got to understand one of the many properties of water.   Water has a very high capacity for holding heat, also called the specific heat capacity.  The specific heat of a substance is basically a description of how much heat the substance (water) must adsorb to increase in temperature.  In the case of water, it takes 4.18 joules of energy to increase the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree C.  For comparison, the specific heat of quartz (the most common soil mineral) is 0.83 joules per gram quartz per degree C.  You don't need to totally understand the units, just know that it takes much more heat to increase the temperature of water than it does to increase the temperature of most all other soil components.<br>  <br>  So, we know water holds a lot of heat.  When we put that water into the soil, it will greatly increase the soil's heat capacity.  Consider a place without a lot of water in the soil, like a desert.  During the day the sun's energy is hitting the soil surface (heat input) and the temperature rapidly increases because of quartz's low heat capacity.  At night, the temperature drops rapidly because, again, the heat capacity of quartz is low.  This is why we see drastic diurnal temperature changes in areas with very low soil moisture content (like Mercury) and minimal temperature changes in temperate regions.  The high specific heat of water allows it to adsorb large amounts of heat and attenuate day-night temperature differences.|`|AA12199454	mercury is the very close to the sun. in addition to the the heat radiation there also exists the tidal effects of the suns gravity pulling on the planit.  it's like bending a paperclip back and forth-it gets very hot due to the friction.  at night this heat disapates rapidly because there is no atmosphere to trap it.
b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	Rube Goldberg machines don’t have to actually work, although when drawn it should seem at least plausible that they could work.<br>  <br>  The first thing to keep in mind is the end result should be a simple task, something that anyone not in possession of the Rube Goldberg machine would or could do rather easily in a non-complicated way: push a button, tip a hat, light a cigar, turn on a fan, etc.<br>  <br>  The second thing to keep in mind is the initiator of the Rube Goldberg machine should also be just as simple, but not necessarily obvious. An overheated man, for example, might desire cooling with a fan and this might be manifested by his profuse perspiration.<br>  <br>  From there you just make up plausible, if unlikely, sequences such as this one: his dog sees the perspiration and attempts to lick it off with his tongue. The dog, however, is restrained by a leash and can only wag its tail in the face of a cat perched on a teeter-totter. The annoyed cat jumps off the teeter-totter, which is counterweighted with a bucket full of water, spilling the bucket of water on a paper towel securing a weight by means of a string and pulley. The wet paper towel breaks, causing the weight to fall on a bellows which blows a puff of cooling air on the man.<br>  <br>  Also note that, once set in operation, most Rube Goldberg machines are one-shot affairs, unless electricity is involved to operate a motor at the end or an animal is provided for motive power.<br>  <br>  If you actually have to build a Rube Goldberg machine, it is not advisable to rely on live animals to participate in any part of its operation. Substitute something mechanical such as a mousetrap triggered by, say, a ball rolling down a ramp. Or perhaps triggering the mousetrap releases a ball that then rolls down a ramp and drops on a teeter-totter that spills a bucket of water. Whatever you build should be easy to reset for the next demonstration of the machine. It’s okay to use electricity in some form or other, such as lighting a lamp or ringing a bell, but it is not in the spirit of Rube Goldberg to actually accomplish anything useful with electricity.<br>  <br>  Have fun. Hope this helped!

DLrrbk8iaa	Good for you!  It 's very hard to step up to the plate and admit you need help.  Not many teens are willing to do that.  It says a lot about a person when they want to do better for themselves.  I found this helpful information online for you.  I hope it helps. :0)  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Break the world down by continents. Though it's very difficult to tackle the memorization of almost 200 names at once, it's much easier to memorize 45 (the current number of countries in Europe). <br>  Step2<br>  Write the names down. Because of the large number of countries to memorize, some mnemonic devices, such as acronyms, will be hard to use. Old-fashioned pencil and paper is your best bet for a good start. Again, list the countries by continent. Writing them down will provide good introduction, allow you to begin visual recognition and assist with proper spelling. <br>  Step3<br>  Use peg words. Peg words are like acronyms, but they form sentences and use real words instead of "made up" words that result from acronyms. Basically, pegs are created from the first letters of the places you are trying to memorize. Utilize a peg sentence to memorize continents with fewer countries. South America, with only 13 countries, is a good continent for this type of memorization. <br>  Step4<br>  Make up a song or story. The most creative way to memorize is to become a storyteller. For example, writing a song with a catchy chorus and different verses naming the countries might be a good way to memorize the 53 countries in Africa. <br>  Step5<br>  Color maps. It seems kind of silly, but associating countries with color is a great way to memorize them. For example, labeling Bolivia on a map and coloring it green every time will not only help you remember the country, but it will also help you remember its location.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	You probably know more than you think that you do.  <br>  You know at least one.

Yes the surface area is bigger in a larger cell, but so is its volume, which means things have to travel farther to get to opposite sides of the cell.

It's the ratio that's important, not just size.<br>  <br>  So instead, my answer would be that nutrients, signals etc that go from cell to cell wouldn't have to travel between as many cells to get to where they need to go.

SvmZlLdaaa	Right on, brother! I agree with you 100%. Rats are wonderful animals that, like so many other species, have been demonised and now have a largely undeserved bad reputation. It is a common belief, for example, that they are 'dirty' - in fact, rats are one of the cleanest animals around, as I'm sure you know if you keep them as pets. They groom themselves more often even than cats - it's been calculated that they spend around a third of their lives cleaning themselves. They are also reviled as carriers of disease - of course wild ones can carry diseases, but that's true of any wild animal. A fluffy little bunny or cuddly little badger cub is just as likely to be carrying something nasty as a rat is, and in most cases, you not only have to encounter an infected individual, but must have close contact with it in order to catch anything. To catch leptospirosis, for example, you must get the animal's urine into an open cut. You are far more likely to catch a disease from another human than you are from any animal - no creature spreads as many diseases as we do ourselves.<br>  <br>  Rats are highly intelligent and very adaptable, able to live almost anywhere and eat almost anything. They have been introduced all over the world by stowing away on ships, and make a good living off the food we humans throw away. Like all rodents, their incisor teeth grow constantly and must be worn down by gnawing or eating hard foods. These teeth are very strong - there are accounts of rats gnawing through concrete! They are excellent climbers and swimmers (they are able to stay afloat for three days in floods!), and breed fast, enabling them to quickly take advantage of new environments or sources of food. They have survived in spite of our best efforts to wipe them out, rapidly learning to avoid traps and becoming immune to poisons. And, as you know, they also make lovely pets - they are much friendlier and more intelligent than hamsters or gerbils, and can be taught all sorts of tricks. I taught a couple of mine to do a tight-rope walk, for example, and every rat I ever had (and that's a lot, believe me!) learned to come when I called its name.<br>  <br>  Pet rats are descended from the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), which is also called the common rat or Norway rat. Wherever there are humans, you are likely to find them - we waste so much food that there's plenty to feed them and other species. Some people seem to have the idea that rats live exclusively in sewers, which of course is nonsense. There are hundreds of thousands of rats living in natural environments like woods and fields, where they feed mainly on seeds, nuts, berries, fruits and invertebrates. Here's a cute image:<br>  <a href="http://science.kukuchew.com/wp-content/u..." rel="nofollow">http://science.kukuchew.com/wp-content/u...</a><br>  <br>  Another well-known species is the black rat (Rattus rattus), also called the ship rat or roof rat. This is the species often associated with the Black Death, though it was not actually spread by rats at all. Though once widespread, this species has been out-competed by the larger and stronger brown rat in many areas.

2lQ8DJAcaa	The sky around the setting sun may take on many colors. The most spectacular shows occur when the air contains many small particles of dust or water. These particles reflect light in all directions. Then, as some of the light heads towards you, different amounts of the shorter wavelength colors are scattered out. You see the longer wavelengths, and the sky appears red, pink or orange.<br>  <br>  The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. <br>  <br>  However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. <br>  <br>  As the sun begins to set, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blu..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blu...</a>|`|nd1f6tBTaa	the sky is blue because it is a reflection, of the ocean i believe.|`|6e6226ae3e5b277df3979c6f88f0fccaaa	the sky is blue because the atmosphere disperses the blue in the visible light Spectrum. the blue has one of the longer wave lengths to its the one reflected. and the color reflected is the color you see. pink has a shorter wave length and is only seen when the light is going though more of the atmosphere(at sunrise and sunset) so that's when it's seen along with the other colors|`|AA11326214	Because it reflects the color of the atmosphere|`|HFsRHZS6aa	Dunno.

As such, they are more prone to hitting molecules of gas in our atmosphere and, therefore, being reflected back to our eyes from areas in the sky not directly between us and the sun.  The blue light bounces around our atmosphere a lot more.  <br>  <br>  This also explains why the sun goes from looking yellow at midday, to looking more orange or red at dusk and dawn: the more atmosphere the light has to travel through, the more that light from the blue end of the spectrum is deflected, and the more we perceive only the light from the red end of the spectrum.
BoUeBvYQaa	> Do different types of light travel at different speeds?<br>  <br>  Not in a vacuum.  In a vacuum, all frequencies of light travel at the same speed.<br>  <br>  In a medium like glass or water, different frequencies may travel at slightly different speeds.  For example, in glass, blue light travels slightly slower than red light (in general, the higher the frequency the slower the speed; so ultraviolet would travel slower than infrared through glass).  This dependence of speed on frequency (or wavelength) is called "dispersion"; and it's what's responsible for spreading out the colors in a rainbow.<br>  <br>  > "If you were in a car traveling at the speed of light, what would happen when you turned on the headlights?"<br>  <br>  Yeah, that question pops up at least once a week around here.  Relativity says that no matter how fast you go, the light will leave your headlights at the speed of light relative to you.  But relativity also says that your car can't reach the speed of light, because time slows down to a crawl--and eventually to zero--as you approach the speed of light.  So all attempts to accelerate your car are increasingly hampered the faster you go.|`|AA11446374	The speed of light only depends on the medium. Frequency times wavelength is a constant - the speed of light. However, the speed of light depends on the substance it is traveling in. Glass, water, vacuum, etc. These all have different speeds of light.|`|Gmvldblraa	In a vacuum all electromagnetic  radiations have been measured as having the same speed, to high degrees of accuracy. And distant stellar events, where we have good reason to thing that wide ranges of frequencies are generated at the same time, show simultaneous arrival here of all frequencies.<br>  However, some frequencies do change speed when they travel through some transparent mediums, in which case the frequencies can separate in the phenomenon we call dispersion, the common example of which is the formation of rainbows.<br>  <br>  No material object can reach the speed of light. What will be seen with the headlights of a very fast car will depend on the position and speed of  the observer.<br>  Have to go.|`|468c5dee5c181b1798b24ccd745a3804aa	the speed of light is 3x10^8 m/s divided by "n".<br>  where "n" is the index of refraction of the medium in which the light is travelling.<br>  <br>  in vacuum, n=1.00000000000<br>  in air, it is 1.0003<br>  in other media, the index of refraction is larger, hence the local speed of light is less than 3x10^8 m/s.<br>  <br>  if you were in a car travelling close to the speed of light, and you turned the lights on, the light would leave your car at v=c in exactly the same way it does when your car is at rest or you are driving to work.<br>  <br>  the photons leaving your headlights would reflect off of objects at rest (which are moving at v~c w.r.t. your car) and hence would be doppler shifted out of the visible, so your eyes would not be able to see these objects passing by your car. a special camera could see them though.<br>  <br>  cheers

Muy probablemente esto también pueda generar ligeros campos magnéticos. Estos campos magnéticos también probablemente generen cambios a nivel morfológico en estas células. Algunos investigadores como el grupo de René Druker Colín en la UNAM, han descubierto que los campos magnéticos, pueden generar crecimiento axonal y probablemente regeneración neuronal. Este principio se está aplicando en pacientes con enfermedades neurodegenerativas como el mal de Parkinson.

Aunque no hay indicios claros de que los andrógenos realmente originen carcinomas prostáticos, sí pueden favorecer el crecimiento de un carcinoma de próstata ya existente. <br>  Digestivo: diarrea. Sistema musculoesquelético: dolor en las piernas, artralgias. Sistema nervioso: mareos, aumento de sudoración, cefalea. Sistema respiratorio: trastorno respiratorio. Piel y anexos: acné, dolor mamario, ginecomastia, prurito, trastorno cutáneo. Sistema urogenital: dolor testicular (trastorno prostático**). Trastornos generales y alteraciones en el sitio de inyección: dolor, hematoma subcutáneo en el sitio de inyección. *Debido al peque?o tama?o de la muestra de estos estudios, la frecuencia de cada evento adverso con una posible relación causal encaja al menos en la categoría frecuente ( 3 1/100). ** Un caso con próstata de tama?o peque?o y una induración en la parte media. En la literatura se han comunicado las siguientes reacciones adversas medicamentosas con los preparados que contienen testosterona: Trastornos de la sangre y del sistema linfático: casos raros de policitemia. Trastornos del metabolismo y de la nutrición: aumento de peso. Sistema musculoesquelético: calambres musculares. Sistema nervioso: nerviosismo, hostilidad, depresión. Sistema respiratorio: apnea del sue?o. Trastornos hepatobiliares: en casos muy raros, ictericia y anomalías de las pruebas de función hepática. Piel y anexos: pueden presentarse diversas reacciones cutáneas, tales como acné, seborrea y calvicie. Sistema reproductor y trastornos mamarios: cambios de la libido, mayor frecuencia de erecciones. El tratamiento con preparados de testosterona a dosis altas comúnmente interrumpe o reduce de manera reversible la espermatogénesis, lo que también reduce el tama?o de los testículos. La terapia de reemplazo del hipogonadismo con testosterona puede, en casos raros, ocasionar erecciones persistentes y dolorosas (priapismo).

SDHvDNGJaa	Todo depende de la técnica que uses. Si empleas una técnica como la de Hematoxilina y Eosina, lo que buscas es constratar el citoplasma marcándolo con eosina que tiene afinidad por las sustancias básicas y lo colorea de rosa. La hematoxilina tiene afinidad por las sustancias ácidas (como los ácidos nucléicos -ADN y ARN-) coloreándolos de morado. Pero existen otros tipos de tinciones. Si empleas tinción tricrómica de Masson, ti?es las fibras de colágeno de azul y los núcleos y las células de rojo.  Si empleas un colorante neutro como el azul de metileno, coloreas de azul la célula completa, si quieres te?ir lípidos entonces no aplicas la técnica histológica convencional, sino que fijas por congelación y ti?es con Sudán III los lípidos.

There are case reports of patients having cardiac arrest under anesthesia linked to use of anti-obesity drugs.<br>  <br>  Phentermine has a long half-life, meaning that it stays in the body for a long time.

I think we need more information before anyone can give you the answer you're looking for.

It made me laugh.<br>  <br>  It's amazing how some species can adapt and survive in an urban environment, like pigeons, foxes, kestrels and magpies.<br>  <br>  It's nice to hear that some species can do well despite man's continued pressure on the environment. Most reports on wildlife are a lot more gloomy than this.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	They are very resourceful creatures.<br>  <br>  Magpies that have become habituated to humans find themselves coming into contact with many unfamiliar objects- they are said to like shiny things, but this is possibly a myth.

mfksOog0aa	No, reason being is that if you look at the population studies done a few decades ago v.s. the population studies now, the growth in the number of animals being bred as captive animals, in a zoo or not, have doubled, tripled, or even more for some species. Take for example the Cheetah. It would have completely died out due to poaching and territorial disputes with the locals in the area. However, despite the dwindling numbers, the population has been brought back to a stable level, though there had to be inbreeding in order to produce offspring. That's the unfortunate part about conservation, that when so little of a species remains, there will be and inevitable amount of interbreeding related genes. <br>  <br>  Now, with a zoo who's met or exceeded the requirements of the AZA and State programs for housing, have gained a lot of experience working and learning about the various species, and are working with the Conservation efforts to offer new genes to the Pool, Zoos are highly beneficial. <br>  <br>  Also, handlers do a lot of research on the care of such animals that they are put in charge of. Some zoos require a few years of zoology/biology/environmental classes, then hands on experience, while others only require the hands on experience with the willingness to learn about the animals. And usually the first several months, you don't even get to work with the animals, just study up and learn from handlers who's been at the zoo for years.<br>  <br>  The animals get fed every day, meeting the nutritional requirements for each individual species, as no diet is alike for every animal. They have shelter, warmth and shade, and are not always subjected to visitors every day. The open hours are far less than the hours that allow them private time to relax and eat, so the visitors rarely ever stress the animals out, unless a particular person is being cruel and taunting the animal. But that's a downside of human nature, not the facility providing a home for these animals.<br>  <br>  I will say that some sanctuaries who are understaffed and under funded should not have the animals, or at least be willing to adopt certain ones out to owners who are trained in caring for the animals, instead of leaving them in an unsatisfactory condition. And I will say that exotics are not for everyone... in factt there's very few people out there who are qualified to own and work with an Exotic, between experience and money.<br>  <br>  I have a great respect for zoos, especially since the standard for the animal upkeep has raised very very high.|`|a64e450ba07c8847d95f73cf740e6a92aa	i think that zoos are kind of inhumane because imagine what it would be like spending your life in a cage with people that keep watching you.<br>  But on the other hand they are safe and they have food.But it would of been nicer if they were protected and in a place where they can find food without any help and live a comfortable life in a natural environment.|`|XoTH3zIwaa	I don't think so, not anymore anyways.  I think now that they are humane, and there are many laws protecting animals, especially at the zoo.  I think there are much more inhumane places for animals to be, like waiting to be killed for food, or waiting to be skinned in China.|`|Ub8arVLpaa	I guess in a certain perspective.  I can imagine that the animal does not have their freedom.  But on the other hand.  They live longer, are safe, fed, and have it easier than in the wild where their are no predators.|`|PvSGrtzJaa	I totally agree with Jim!  Just imagine being a hungry lion in Africa!  Your not sure when you will eat again.  In a zoo, you get 3 hots and a cot!  Life is good for zoo animals!|`|LJkPRqN0aa	i think it can go both ways, sometimes zoos are there to help rehabilitate wounded animals back into the wild. while on the other hand they keep those that are perfectly healthy in cages. so i guess you can see it both ways.|`|7SvSazrfaa	I live in a zoo!!!!!!!!!!<br>  i like it just fine<br>  your face is inhumane!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|YZqDpBGUaa	Definately.  Unless the animal has never been wild and free.  If they were born in captivity [or if the animal was injured outside of captivitiy and had no chance of survival otherwise] then I believe it's ok.  Otherwise it's the saddest thing ever.  Those animals must get so sick of being in one place their whole lives.  I saw a seal once, swimming in a circle around his tank.  I felt like crying.|`|pRCLV8Xcaa	yes and no<br>  yes cuz they r kept in cages and prob r lonely and dont get the proper diet most of the time<br>  no cuz they get a good home|`|btCc2CRNaa	No, its like giving a person a free mansion with free meals and services.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	yes
9Xur3g9Paa	Cells starved for glucose (simple sugar) need energy.  Whether blood sugar is high or low, if insulin is not enabling the glucose to get into cells there is no energy for the cell to function.  One response the body uses is to begin breaking down other tissues for energy.  In the process ketones are formed and the resulting chemical changes in blood can result in a state called ketoacidosis.
4hsl2toNaa	When someone becomes ill and the Dr. feels they need nourishment, they get an IV.  An IV is temporary, a way of putting medication, nourishment for the cells and fluids into the body.  This is why transfusions are put in thru IV's.  Blood is not a natural thing to put into the body.  We have an adequate supply of our own and the ability to produce more, which we do regularly.  <br>  If some one has an NPO (nothing by mouth) order, then IV is the only solution.  IV is a form of feeding.|`|9Xur3g9Paa	Infusing alcohol is a dangerous endeavor for many reasons not the least of which is that it will probably be painful at the site of injection.  Second, the advice to abstain is based on a medical condition caused by alcohol coming in contact with various organs including the brain.  While it is possible that alcohol induced gastric erosions and other gastric problems motivated the recommendation to stop drinking, listen up.  Shooting alcohol will avoid making the stomach or intestinal lesions and bleeding worse, but if your need to have alcohol is so strong that you will shoot it, you have a more serious problem that your stomach.  Have you considered taking alcohol enemas?|`|0l1ZairMaa	Yes ma'am!<br>  When a person is too ill to take nourishment by mouth, it's usually given intraveously...so I feel that blood transfused through an I.V. is the same as eating it or drinking it.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Actually I would have to say no because unlike being fed intravenously, your body would not recognize transfused blood as being nourishment and blood that is eaten would not enter your bloodstream as blood like alcohol which would still be alcohol in the blood. It would have to be broken down in your digestive track to be recognized as food in the bloodstream. So from that standpoint it is not the same as eating blood.  Blood transfused into the veins is more like an organ transplant and unlike food, if it was not compatible it would activate the body's immune system to reject it and thus cause real problems. Again unlike food.<br>  <br>  Suppose some blood was taken from a person who had been fasting for 30 days and was transfused into another person. How much nourishment would there be in that blood?  The point is that transfused blood is not food. It is a transport system to carry nutrients and oxygen to the cells but it is not of itself, food.<br>  <br>  However Adam and Eve were told not to eat the forbidden fruit, and Eve believed that God said of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, "Do not touch it for fear you may die". Would it not be most presumptuous for us to think that a blood transfusion was OK when the Bible says not to eat blood and to abstain from blood? For that reason Jehovah's Witnesses whose priority is to please Jehovah above everything else will endeavor not to come anywhere near receiving a transfusion of whole blood or of using whole blood for another purpose for personal gain.<br>  <br>  Eating blood is not the same as transfusing it but likewise eating of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not the same as touching it and Eve knew that. She also knew it was wrong just to touch the fruit from that tree. Similarly we stay away from using whole blood. Some consciences do permit the use of minor blood fractions and for good reason. Why? Because the Bible does not condemn eating meat and the meat we eat does have trace amounts of whole blood. So then blood fractions could be viewed in the same way as those trace amounts of whole blood are. But again that is a matter of personal conscience.<br>  <br>  btw  I am a vegetarian by choice. It has nothing to do with my religion or with trying to avoid all blood.|`|HItbioaMaa	It's a proven fact that intravenous taking of nourishment is eating. In Biblical times, there was obviously no concept of intravenous feeding, but that doesn't mean that this principle of not eating blood shouldn't apply today.<br>  As for Pangolin; We don't 'force' doctors to do or not do anything. We accept various other forms of treatments. Cancer, for example, can be and is treated using several different methods. We are merely exercising our right to refuse one treatment for another.<br>   If this still offends you, request of your employer that you would like to exercise YOUR right not to treat Jehovah's Witnesses. I'm certain the patient will appreciate your efforts.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	I don't understand why people cannot see that Doctors Lie to them and at a very critical time when they need help, Many people work at a place that shows what is called the Blood Video and in this video they tell you how to carefully approach someone who has been injured in the work place, in fact they tell you to treat a person as if the blood was toxic or contaminated with stuff such as AIDS HIV, HEPATITIS and any of 98 other blood bord infections, Now the Red Cross says there is nothing wrong with peoples blood and it is Safe to put in your body(at about $500-$2000 a liter), Now lets think about it, Free Blood at $500 plus a liter, sounds like a Doctor will keep his mouth shut when it comes to making money, some think they test for infections, OK! 100 known blood infections for each liter, Can you imagine how much time and money that would be, Sorry people, Doctors of modern medicine have a No Blood approach now days and all you have to do is ask for it, unless you like playing russian roulette with your family. You can even bank your blood and if they have no choice but to use blood for an operation, then they can dilute your blood 5 times and let you bleed that out and then put your whole blood back in you after the operation and you will heal many times faster and with almost no side effects, So Yes Transfusions is eating Blood!|`|b0d1be009491a87c770b3458819fb122aa	Transfusion is, spiritually speaking, EVEN MUCH WORSE than "just" eating blood.<br>  <br>  Ask Jesus himself:<br>  (Matthew 15:16-17) At this he said: “Are YOU also yet without understanding? 17?Are YOU not aware that everything entering into the mouth passes along into the intestines and is discharged into the sewer?"<br>  <br>  And moreover:<br>  <br>  There are three reasons that the best medical treatment is a treatment WITHOUT blood! <br>  <br>  For Jehovah′s Witnesses is the most important one  the fact that blood is holy and might be shed only for the purpose of a sacrifice.<br>  <br>  Every other use, whether one makes wall color from it, black pudding for dinner or even directly squirt it into your veins is an open infringement on God′s  competence, actually one even robs God with doing so.<br>  <br>  God is the provider of all good gifts, he is the source of life. Our health depends on him anyway, don′t you believe he could save us easily without blood?  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the past he permitted first Noah to kill animals and to eat meat. He ordered  already at that time to let the meat to bleeding out. <br>  <br>  For us Christians he just  renewed this order!  <br>  The Bible says in  (Acts 15:28-29): For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to YOU, except these necessary things, 29 to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If YOU carefully keep yourselves from these things, YOU will prosper. Good health to YOU!”<br>  <br>  Do you really believe God orders to us to do things that harm us? And should we really die, because we keep to his orders, don′t you believe  he′ll re-surrect us  with pleasure?<br>  <br>  But I spoke about THREE reasons. The second reason is that the benefit which a blood transfusion indisputably has can be achieved with alternative procedures not only also, but  BETTER , SAFER and CHEAPER. <br>  <br>  The medical use of a blood transfusion ONLY consists in supplementing the volume that the blood circulation does not collapse!  Why? The red blood cells which normally transport the oxygen get practically entirely INACTIVATED BY THE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED DAY-LONG STORAGE of blood conserves! However, the own body increases its production by a manyfold.. So plasma-expanders are the means of choice.<br>  <br>  The third reason is that blood transfusions are inherently dangerous: <br>  IIIa)  the blood group incompatibilities which can lead even to the coagulation inside the veins, <br>  IIIb)  immunologic reactions, the blood of the patient can resist against the donor-blood as well as <br>  IIIc)  the transferred immune cells of the donor's blood can attack the organism of the host.<br>  <br>  IIId) Finally one must always consider the danger of infections.<br>  <br>  Hepatitis, AIDS and many others are to this day incurable and partly fatal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Let′s  summarize: 1st God prohibits it, 2nd  It′s useless, 3rd  It can even kill us.<br>  <br>  Why on earth should we do such a thing?|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Drinking alcohol or having it put directly into his veins is essentially the same thing, you are still receiving the effects of alcohol, you are just having it put into your system in different ways.|`|py39L7Wraa	:) yes it's the same, as you pointed out in the illustration. the doctor said to abstain from it. so by injecting it in the veins it comes as taking it in.|`|4q66CvgLaa	its the same . when a person needs a drip to feed them the nutrients go straight into the blood stream and gets absorbed as food . having a blood transfusion is no different ,|`|m4yMJ55daa	"I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.." - The Hippocratic Oath<br>  <br>  It took doctors 50 yrs to figger out that the same idea works with  blood transfusions|`|GfG6wupTaa	Putting it in your veins is not abstaining!!!! That means not at all.|`|ad66303e43f746ff778f292b10d3a8fcaa	This is a very important subject in the bible.<br>  This command was repeated in both the old testament and the new testament.<br>  <br>  In Gen 9:4 Noah was told that blood was sacred. <br>  9:5 God went on to explain that "besides that, your blood of your souls shall I ask back. From the hand of every living creature shall I ask it back; and from the hand of man, from the hand of each one who is his brother, shall I ask back the soul of man,"<br>  <br>  It is important that we do not ignore the value of our own personal blood.  Do not mix it with the blood of others.  <br>  <br>  In the new testament in Acts 15:28 & 29 the prohibition was repeated to Christians. This was so important, I love how in verse 28 it brings out that they were simplifying things so there would not be any confusion.  At this time the religious leaders and people had created so many traditions and laws that things had become overwhelming and burdensome to the people.<br>  The apostles wrote in  verse 28 "For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these things are necessary things, (29) to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.  If you carefully keep yourselves from these things you will prosper, Good healthy to you!<br>  <br>  So what was important was not how many times you washed your hands or what color clothing you wore, and all the many rules and procedures that had been added to the people, these four things were the MOST important.<br>  1) Keep away from things sacrificed to idols.<br>  2) Keep away from blood.<br>  3) Keep away from things strangled. <br>  4) Keep away from fornication.<br>  <br>  Today people freely have sex outside of marriage and live together thinking God doesn't care.  They also think that it is honorable and are proud that they donate and receive others blood into their bodies.<br>  It is not.  Blood is sacred.  Jesus shed blood for us, his blood.  The soul is in our blood.|`|AA11432707	We do not take transfusion lightly.  Like many things in medicine, it carries risk.  We carefully weigh that risk against the benefits of the treatment.  Many, many lives have been saved by transfusions, my own grandmother, for one, just last year at the age of 92.  She had a major GI bleed, and is now going strong at 93, bless her heart.<br>  <br>  If you choose not to accept blood products, that's your right as a patient.  You cannot, however, force a physician to go against what he or she believes is right.  You may kill yourself, but you cannot compel someone else to be an agent of that death or disability.  Some of us care for JW pts and some of us don't.  I usually do, btw.  It's a pain the butt for big surgeries, but I haven't had the situation of having to deal with a case where transfusion is almost certain.  I'd probably decline in that instance.  Your unnecessary death (heart attack, stroke, renal failure) would haunt me.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses have a different translation of the Bible than many other denominations, and blood transfusion is not the only area of difference.  (When JW's come to our house, my husband invites them in for study with his Bible in the original Hebrew and Greek.  After awhile, the church stops them from coming over, LOL)<br>  <br>  (Even the word "Jehovah" is a bastardization of the tetragrammaton with the vowel markings for "Adonai" put in so that Jews wouldn't say the name of God aloud.)<br>  <br>  Believe what you want.  I don't think you know much about medicine, transfusion medicine in particular.

If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper, Good heath to you!" (There the eating of blood is equated with idolatry and fornication, things that we should not want to engage in.)
AA11103371	Well... It's complicated.  It's completely different depending on what organism you're talking about.  Different critters have different metabolisms.

Also, the heart functions independently, meaning that the cardiac muscles work themselves.  Furthermore, your heart has a much better supply of oxygen then your arm.|`|rvRimbVYaa	Your heart is full of energy because oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood pass from it. It is a powerful organ and works on itself. It gets like electric currents to work that is why in hospitals they use those electrical things to reanimate a person. And your heart when it pumps has two positions: diastolic position when the heart relaxes for a short period of time and systolic when it contracts and is not relaxing, so your heart is continuously working and relaxing and in your life it will pomp whole gallons of blood. For your hand gets energy from oxygen which comes from deoxygenated blood and the muscles are used too so it will have limits and it dies not relax and work like the heart and there is the fact that you are increasing the rate of contractions and relaxation of heart which is another strain.

J3TGyOnDaa	In the Mesozoic era, and they didn't dominate until the Cretaceous period.<br>  <br>  "...Flowering plants, in terms of the history of life on earth, are fairly "new inventions." Life on earth is reckoned as having dawned a little over four billion years ago. Microscopic blue-green algae appeared in the oceans around 3.5 billion years ago. Other forms of algae, as well as ferns, fungi, mosses and other non-flowering plants gradually evolved and ultimately, during the Silurian Period between 443 and 417 million years ago, plants arose with adaptations enabling them to live on dry land. Many millions of years passed, and then only about 375 million years ago did the first forests appear. <br>  <br>  And even then, there were no flowering plants. The first forests consisted of ferns and fern-like plants. Conifer trees, non-flowering ancestors of pines and spruces, developed approximately 285 million years ago. Finally, it was only long after the first mammals and the first birds began gracing the landscape that the first flowering plants came into existence -- only about 135 million years ago. Even then it wasn't until 80-90 million years ago that flowering plants began dominating the landscape. ..."<br>  <br>  From:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.backyardnature.net/fpdefine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.backyardnature.net/fpdefine.h...</a>|`|HABoqbYOaa	<a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/cntdrift.htm" rel="nofollow">http://waynesword.palomar.edu/cntdrift.h...</a><br>  165 million years ago..<br>  Check on the link, it's pretty good..Made sense to me..<br>  GL with your project..|`|7gcA24cSaa	um excuse me smartpants but God created that stuff n that was about 6-10 thousand years ago n if u have a problem with that then too bad for u. its what i believe|`|hg8ExtsNaa	you talkin wacky tobaccy or what?

AA10335036	The reflected rays of light appear to be coming from a distance behind the mirror equal to your nose's distance in front of the mirror.<br>  Flat-mirror reflection has the interesting property that it produces an image that is reversed along what is usually called the z axis, that is, the axis perpendicular to the mirror and, when the mirror is on the wall and you are standing, running back-to-front on your body. So in the reflection all points appear to be behind the mirror the same distance they are in front.<br>  Incidentally this z-axis reversal also accounts for why we don't appear upside-down and why our right hand is still on the right in the image. Only z-axis, not x- and y-axis distances are changed. So in a mirror a person doesn't appear as he does when you look at him, because when you look at him from the front, both his y- and z-axis points are reversed relative to your own body. (When he turns his back to you his rotation unreverses these points.)

The perception of color is determined by the presence of cone photoreceptors within the retina. These cone cells function in bright light conditions and comprise approximately 20% of the photoreceptors in the central retina of the dog. In humans, the central retina (macula) is 100% cones.

If you can't see in color, then you'll see in grayscale and it would be very hard to see the colored ball against the gray background.  The lack of response indicates that the cat does not have color vision.<br>  <br>  To test motion detection:  put a human and a cat in a dark room, and move something at a decent distance away.  Change the object's distance and you can tell when the cat/human will respond.<br>  <br>  It's not terribly hard to test these kinds of things.

z7BiMSWmaa	Nucleosome: Subunit of chromatin composed of a short length of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins.<br>  <br>  The human genome contains about 3 billion nucleotide pairs organized as 23 chromosomes pairs. If uncoiled, the DNA contained by each of those chromosomes would measure between 1.7 and 8.5 cm (0.67 to 3.35 inches) long. This is too long to fit into a cell. Moreover, if chromosomes were composed of extended DNA, it is difficult to imagine how the DNA could be replicated and segregated into two daughter cells without breaking down.<br>  <br>  In fact chromosomal DNA is packaged into a compact structure with the help of specialized proteins called histones. The complex DNA plus histones in eucaryotic cells is called chromatin.<br>  <br>  The fundamental packing unit is known as a nucleosome. Each nucleosome is about 11nm in diameter. The DNA double helix wraps around a central core of eight histone protein molecules (an octamer) to form a single nucleosome. A second histone (H1) fastens the DNA to the nucleosome core. The total mass of this complex is about 100,000 daltons.<br>  <br>  Nucleosomes are usually packed together, with the aid of a histone (H1,) to form a 30nm large fiber. As a 30nm fiber, the typical human chromosome would be about 0.1cm in length and would span the nucleus 100 times. This suggests higher orders of packaging, to give a chromosome the compact structure seen in a typical karyotype (metaphase) cell.
mmWeBRRtaa	quick answer: somewhere between 10,000 and 170,000 years<br>  <br>  This question is more difficult to answer than you might expect.  The best discussion I've seen is here:<br>  <a href="http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php" rel="nofollow">http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2007/lo...</a><br>  <br>  To summarize the above link:  Textbooks and web pages often give *incorrect* numbers in the range from 100,000 to 50 million years, but few people have done the detailed calculations.  Even with good calculations, the answer is highly uncertain, but the best estimate is that it lies in the range from 10,000 years to 170,000 years.<br>  <br>  The reason the calculation is tricky is that the mean free path is much smaller in the sun's core (about 0.01 cm) than in the outer sun (about 0.3 cm).  To do this calculation correctly, you need to work with a model of the mean free path as a function of distance from the center of the sun.<br>  <br>  The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before it interacts with a particle.  Because of these interactions, a photon in the center takes an incredibly long and complex path before it finally emerges from the surface.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  In case you're interested in how to do this calculation, here's a simplified version.  We'll assume that the mean free path is a constant value of 0.1 cm everywhere in the sun.  We have the following:<br>  <br>  radius of sun R = 7e8 m<br>  speed of light c = 3e8 m/sec<br>  mean free path (assumed) P = 0.1 cm = 1e-3 m<br>  <br>  If a photon traveled in a direct line from center to edge, the number of interactions would be<br>  N_straight = R/P = 7e11<br>  <br>  In reality, however, it travels not in a straight line but like a random walk.  The mathematics of a random walk specifies that the actual number of interactions to travel this distance is the square of the number needed if it traveled in a straight line:<br>  N_actual = N_straight^2 = 4.9e23<br>  <br>  The distance traveled is<br>  D = N_actual * P = 4.9e23 * 1e-3 = 4.9e20 m<br>  <br>  The time to travel this distance is<br>  T = D/c = 4.9e20 / 3e8 = 1.63e12 s = 52,000 years<br>  <br>  As noted above, this is an approximation.  To do the calculation correctly, you need to take into account the fact that the mean free path varies as a function of distance from the center.|`|E1DOJj67aa	The interior of the Sun is a remarkable place.<br>  <br>  At the core, the densities approach 150 times that of water - and under such conditions a photon has a *very* short mean-free path (the average distance it travels before scattering from something).<br>  <br>  I recall from my 20 year old Stellar Physics 101 class, calculating the mean-free path, it turned out to be microns or so, and gave rise to a diffusion time of a 10^4 years (ten thousand years) or so.<br>  <br>  Antttt! is perfectly correct.|`|v15npNiUaa	The speed of light is 299,792,458 miles per second.<br>  The sun's diameter is 864,327,328 miles.<br>  If the core is in the centre of the sun, we have to get the radius (formula would be 'diameter divided by two') and multiply it by the speed of light.<br>  <br>  Therefore 864,327,328 divided by 2 is 432,163,664 miles.<br>  <br>  Now we have to divide the speed of light by 60 because we want to determine the minutes and not the seconds.<br>  <br>  Therefore 299,792,458 divided by 60 is 4,996,540 (miles per minute)<br>  <br>  Now we have to multiply the speed of light by the radius of the sun.<br>  <br>  Therefore 4,996,540 multiplied by 432,163,664 divided by 60 would be your answer.<br>  <br>  However I think what you were trying to say is that how long it takes for the sun's light (from the surface) to reach the Earth. If that is your question, then it is 8 minutes.|`|ppPX2c3Vaa	I believe that the process of Nuclear Fusion and then the long trek of the energy to reach the surface of the sun takes around 10 million years (maybe a couple million years less) and after the energy has gotten to the surface of the sun, it takes another 8.3 minutes to reach Earth.|`|mBsL0azYaa	Approximately 10,000 years.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	About 8 minutes. <br>  <br>  Also light from the sun doesn't come from its core.
luYtFLSUaa	A simple answer that purists might not approve of, but<br>  <br>  When a star dies and collapses, gravity forces it into a very dense state like dwarf star - degenerate matter. In such matter, atoms are crushed and may consist of nuclei surrounded by a kind of electronic fog - not unlike plasma.<br>  A teaspoonful of such matter might weigh tons.  Some stars are heavier than others, however, and the  collapse will not stop at the dwarf star stage ( heavier means stronger gravity). The fog will collapse forcing electrons against protons in a nucleus and thus transforming them into neutrons.  Thus we end up with a sphere of neutrons packed "skin to skin" and we have a giant atomic nucleus.  Protons and electrons have reacted away and only neutrons remain behind, The density of such a star is phenomenal !  No denser matter is possible in this universe. This material is called neutronium|`|CfTQQkKfaa	When a star collapses, the core gets compressed.  Usually, with smaller stars, the core is small enough so that it simply collapses into a white dwarf.  The star is being held up against its own gravity by something called the electron degeneracy pressure.  But, if the gravity is too strong, the star can overcome the power of the electron pressure and collapse even further.  The gravity depends on the mass of the core.  The lower limit for the required mass of the core is 1.44 solar masses (the CORE of the collapsed star has to be 1.44 times the mass of our ENTIRE sun), and it known as the Chandrasekhar limit.  If the core is more massive than approx 4 solar masses, the core will instead collapse into a black hole.  This limit is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.<br>  <br>  At this point, the protons and electrons fuse, negating each others elementary charge (proton +, electron -) and finally ending up as a neutron.  Neutron stars are extremely dense (roughly 4.1 x 10^14 times the density of the sun), and can be packed into an area with a diameter of only 20 kilometers.<br>  <br>  They are so dense that a teaspoon of a neutrons stars material would weigh 10 million tons.|`|TYlS5Wh9aa	A  neutron star is a remnant of an exploded star -supernova - and has a mass of about1.5 - 2 solar masses, and about 10-15 km across with a density in excess of one billion kg/m3. It contains mainly, err, neutrons. Like an ice-skater pullling their arms in, the collapse of the star causes the star remnant to spin very quickly. Larger stars of greater than 5 solar masses may create a black hole.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	A star that has collapsed under its own gravity; it is composed of neutrons.|`|Ctq3pcIsaa	A star that has collapsed under its own gravity; it is composed of neutrons.(the other girl copied my answer)|`|ky3B42f6aa	An incredibly dense star left over from the collapse of an very large star.  <br>  <br>  Look up    <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-neutron-star.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-neutro...</a>

CYtMRC4eaa	Depending on the phenotypes, the recessive homozygotes are relatively easy to spot in a population.  If R=red flowers, then the recessive homozygotes have the white flowers, rr.  If T=tall, then the recessive homozygotes are the short plants, tt, etc.<br>  <br>  Count the number of recessive homozygotes in the population, and divide this number by the population size to determine the frequency of the recessive homozygotes.  The square root  of this is the frequency of the recessive allele.  Subtract this from 1 to get the frequency of the dominant allele.<br>  <br>  An example:  Assume B=black fur and b=white fur in a population of 1000 hamsters.  You count 40 white hamsters.  40/1000 = 0.04, which is the frequency of the recessive homozygote, bb; thus, the frequency of the recessive allele, b, is sqrt(0.04) or 0.2.<br>  <br>  The frequency of the dominant allele, B, is 1-0.2 or 0.8.<br>  <br>  (In that population, there are 1000-40=960 black ones, 640 are homozygous dominant, BB, and 320 are heterozygous black, Bb).
kYFtoVpXaa	(if only I could get more points for this)<br>     City expansion is expecting to multiply in the world's cities within this century. Traffic is going to run over our highways and many train station will be deemed obsolete. With the ground crowded and all roads jammed, the only quick way to go would be by air.<br>     Helicopters will be used in transporting goods across close distances while airplanes will be used to transport goods across longer distances. On the ground, cars, mostly hybrids, will still be in good use, while subway systems will increase in large clusters. Small stations will turn into plazas and plazas will turn into larger plazas. Of course though, walking will still be a good method of movement and perhaps walking will also be a better method of saving gas and getting to places uncrowded.

2lQ8DJAcaa	The fury of the Mount St. Helen blast was attributed to the complex interactions between the Pacific Plate, North American Plate, and tiny Juan de Fuca plate, an area known as a triple plate junction.<br>  On May 18, 1980, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake triggered the collapse of the volcano’s bulging north flank and summit in a landslide of historic proportions. Magma trapped within the volcano, suddenly relieved of pressure, exploded outward in a lateral blast that blew down 230 square miles of forest in less than five minutes. Heat from a rising plume of volcanic ash melted glacial ice creating cement-like slurries of rock and ash called mud flows. Superheated avalanches of hot gas, ash, and pumice called pyroclastic flows flowed into the valley north of the crater. The resulting landscape was a seemingly gray wasteland.<br>  <br>  Plates pushing against each other or are colliding produce a convergent plate boundary. This type of boundary results in one plate is being pulled beneath another (subduction) forming a deep trench. The long, narrow zone where the two plates meet is called the subduction zone. Here, a more dense oceanic crust is being subducted under the less dense continental crust. Subduction zones tend to create large, cone-shaped volcanos called stratovolcanos, such as Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Baker in Washington State.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Convergence along a convergent boundary.

NbfPOG9eaa	Yes, that is the origin of all feral hogs in the U. S. Even recently some have bought domestic hogs and turned them loose with the feral ones to improve the local strain. I see many red and spotted feral hogs here. Feral populations that have been feral for many years are coal black and razor thin.

g3Uogm7Haa	Hi Nik,<br>    <br>       My family has experienced contact with beings throughout my entire life.  As a child I was terrified.  I have tried many techniques over the years, some of which have worked better than others.  When I was younger I used to resist and fight throughout the experience.  I would force myself "awake" and free myself from the experience.  It didn't always work because I was forced asleep many times.  <br>  <br>  I was raised Catholic (no longer the case).  But when an experience would begin I recited the Our Father over and over again, believing the prayer would protect me.  It worked.  I prayed so hard when things would happen and it pushed them away.<br>  <br>  At one point in my life I was told that they were here to help us and that being taken was a positive thing, regardless of how scary it was.  I went into a period of submission.  I would allow myself to be taken.  When things would start happening, I'd allow myself to go to sleep and basically tell them "take me, just don't let me know what's going on."  My fear went away, but so did my free will and ability to fight back.  <br>  <br>  I later came to the conclusion that nobody has the right to violate me and take me without my permission.  I no longer believe this is a "positive" experience, especially if such fear is being invoked.  <br>  <br>  I believe there are several different types of "abductions."  Some are physical and some are spiritual.  Some are also positive where others are negative.  Most of my experience is in the spiritual realm.  I believe these beings feed on our fear.  They instill it in us because it weakens our awareness and gives them power and maybe some sort of spiritual nourishment.  If you can be confident and strong, you can realize that if you don't fear them, they have no power.  (Easier said than done).  Meditation can greatly improve your strength and awareness.  I also set up protection every night before I go to bed.  I picture myself surrounded by a white light that protects me from harm.  If I am faced with a negative presence I picture this light pushing everything away.  I concentrate intently on waking myself up and resisting their control.  I no longer use prayer, but would still hightly recommend it if you are religious.  It truly helped because it allowed me to FOCUS my attention away from my fear, putting the power and control back in my control.  Find something that makes you feel confident and in control.  This will help you better cope and deal with your situation, whether you are embracing the experience or pushing it away.  I wish you the best of luck in your journey.  <br>  <br>  I am the moderator of a group, TruthSeikers, designed to offer support to people like us in search of answers, support, or discussion.

A psychiatrist should be able to help you with such a problem and there are meds that help anxiety.  <br>  <br>  But I caution you that you need to be sure that your abductions are real, and are not, for example ,dreams or daydreaming - a psychiatrist can aid you in this area as well.  <br>  <br>  Doc|`|qKvnpwL6aa	Learn to love the aliens.

JDl0z6TGaa	1. Air is made up of many gases. Gases have molecules that move about freely. The smell which created by the perfume is moved around by the moving molecules in air. It takes time for the molecules to bring that scent across the room. On colder days it would take longer than hotter days because molecules move slower when the temperature is lower than normal. Sorry if this is a little hard to understand, its hard for me to describe.<br>  <br>  2. The He balloon will deflate first because the density of the molecules is less than the density of N2 molecules. In other words N2 molecules are bigger than He molecules, thus less N2 molecules are allowed to escape.<br>  <br>  3. when H2O is frozen the molecule structure forms a crystal like structure which spreads the molecules farther apart than in liquid water.<br>  <br>  Ice stucture<br>  <a href="http://www.benbest.com/cryonics/icecryst.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.benbest.com/cryonics/icecryst...</a><br>  Liquid water<br>  <a href="http://cms.mcc.uiuc.edu/pimcpp/images/thumb/6/6d/LiquidWater.png/450px-LiquidWater.png" rel="nofollow">http://cms.mcc.uiuc.edu/pimcpp/images/th...</a><br>  <br>  5. A gas acts has ideal behavior when it has a full electron shell. Why? An ideal gas is one that has a full electron shell and is non reactant most of the time. Ideal behavior is basically the same except its not an element but a compound.<br>  <br>  6. 1 gram of gas H2O would occupy the most volume because it is a gas. Gases are able to spread and take the same volume of the container. 1 Gram of H2O(L) will take the shape of part of the container however it will not take up the entire volume because the molecules are more densly pact in a liquid than a gas. <br>  <br>  9. The hot air is pressurized in a pressure cooker. The more molecules able to obtain a certain heat will be able to heat a food placed in the preesure cooker faster. It heats faster because more molecules are giving off heat to the food.<br>  <br>  11. I would probably have a burn from gass at 100C because lets assume you spilled 100C water on your hand. The water will stay on your hand and coninue to burn you over a longer period of time. Also there are more molecules that obtain a temperature of 100C to give off in water than in gas.

CD1T7gaXaa	Auras are most apparent when seen through Kirlian photography, so it would be possible in theory to see auras on film, tape, DVD or transmitted broadcasts. People who are sensitive to auras in people around them may not have the vision or technical expertise to see faint auras in video displays, and of course not all video will lend itself well to aura revelation.<br>  <br>   I found a link about celebrity auras, but I wouldn't consider the source rock solid. You might find it interesting anyway.|`|kH8R2ByLaa	I was skeptical when my sensei first brought up the eventual result of my training with him, seeing auras. It took six months of dietary scrupulance and meditative states for me to finally have the," wont believe it until you see it with your own eyes", realization. The majority of people will never get the chance to have such training as I did, so most will never believe, which is understandable since I was once one of them. So to all the other posts, I believe you share no grounds with which to answer this question upon as I. I had the same revelation as you several years ago, and drew upon my own conclusion. On television or film, all one is able to pick up, is the refractory light which normal people see, photons. The aura is an energy field resonating from the smallest particals that hold together all forms of matter. Their energy pattern is not the same as the mass which binds them. Personally, ATM I can no longer see auras, I believe this is because I have not kept up the high vibrational energy diet that I used to, and also cause I smoke and drink now. But in my experience, I recall, try as i might, back when it was second nature for me to detect the intermitent auras, from humans to sidewalk concrete, I could not sense any differentiary aura patterns from people I saw on tv, besides the television itself, which only ever held 1 particular aura pattern.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Courtland|`|TL2XoF5baa	Auras don't exist, but happy enjoyable people do.. look for the happy smiling people and you will see more than any aura can offer..|`|zPPJ9zUKaa	mostly around people when you take their pictures|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	When I had a TV set, I only saw an aura on one person, and not on anybody else, but that was 8 years ago.

While in deep relaxation and meditation I have seen auras - the first time really startled me. I had never even thought about being able to see auras when it happened to me the first time. In fact I thought the idea was a load of rubbish. I'm still skeptical about the claims others make on the subject, but there's no doubt in my mind some people do experience this.  <br>  <br>  The auras I've seen were electric and alive. Neon glowing, very bright, distinctly deep *living* colors. And moving, like waves of electric energy, all around the body. How auras are seen, I don't know, but in my opinion they represent the living energy emanating from the body, and couldn't be visible in any way but up close and personal.<br>  <br>  Migraines and visual disturbances are altogether different things. If you've ever seen an aura for real, you would certainly know the difference.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	An aura, according to New Age metaphysics, is a colored outline or set of contiguous outlines, allegedly emanating from the surface of an object. Auras are not to be confused with the aureoles or halos of saints, which are devices of Christian iconography used to depict the radiance of light associated with divine infusion. In the New Age, even the lowly amoeba has an aura, as does the mosquito and every lump of goat dung.  The aura supposedly reflects a supernatural energy field or life force that permeates all things. Human auras allegedly emerge from the   chakras. Under ordinary circumstances, auras are only visible to certain people with  special psychic power. However, with a little bit of training, or with a special set of Aura Goggles with "pinacyanole bromide" filters (available at your local New Age Head Shop), anyone can see auras. You may also use   Kirlian photography to capture auras on film. At least that is what New Age spiritualists believe.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you may also see auras if you have a migraine, a certain form of epilepsy, a visual system disorder or a brain disorder. These auras, however, are somewhat different from the kind encouraged by most aura training exercises. These involve staring at an object placed against a white background in a dimly lit room. What one sees is due to retinal fatigue and other natural perceptual processes, not the unleashing of hidden psychic powers. Something similar happens when you stare at certain colored or black and white patterns. Vision is not the verbatim recording of the outside world. When looking at a colored object, for example, the eye does not transmit to the brain a continuous series of duplicate impressions. The brain itself supplies much of the visual perception. In short, even if auras are perceived, that is not good evidence that there is an energy field in the physical or supernatural world corresponding to the perceptions.<br>  <br>  If you see auras, you may not be psychic; you may have a brain or vision disorder. See your physician ASAP.|`|SAceGS46aa	People cant actually see auras, unless there high.|`|ss3QPHKIaa	I can see auras, and I can see it in person.|`|2s7V2wSPaa	when pigs fly outta my butt.

That assumes that every neuron is firing at few Hertz, and that each neuron performs a simple calculation.<br>  <br>  We currently have built computers that are about 1/100 of that power - and can simulate in hardware (if anyone were bothered to do it) something as complex as the brain of a mouse.<br>  <br>  The rate of increase in computer power means that by about 2020 or 2025 we will have systems capable of the same power as a human brain.<br>  <br>  So, have a little patience, and you'll see such systems (and more powerful ones) in a little while.

luYtFLSUaa	The earth is tilted to the ecliptic by around 23 degrees.  In the northern hemisphere the angle between celestial equator and the sun at its highest point in the sky (jun21) is therefore 23 degrees. The sun is "above", or north of, the equator. In late December, the sun at its lowest point is 23 degrees "below", or south of,  the equator. The spread over one year then from "lo sun" to "High sun" is 46 degrees which a reasonable large angle.<br>  <br>  Another way to put this is that the sun rides high in summer and low in winter unless you are in the southern hemisphere<br>  <br>  Doc|`|xuCY36yWaa	TOO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN,LOOK IT UP!

Existe mucha evidencia consistente con esta edad basada Bíblicamente. Por ejemplo:<br>  <br>  1. Los continentes se están erosionando demasiado rápido. Si los continentes en verdad tuvieran miles de millones de a?os, ya se habrían erosionado por el viento y agua. La elevación de las monta?as al igual que los otros procesos geológicos de ‘reciclaje’ no son capaces de explicar el nivel de erosión.<br>  <br>  2. Los océanos no son lo suficientemente salados. Cada a?o se depositan millones de toneladas de sal en el océano a través de los ríos, incluyendo los subterráneos. Sólo una fracción de ésta regresa a tierra firme. Utilizando las presuposiciones más favorables para los que creen en edades grandes, la edad máxima absoluta del océano es tan sólo una fracción de los supuestos ‘miles de<br>  millones de a?os.<br>  <br>  3. La atmósfera no tiene el Helio pronosticado. El helio es un gas ligero formado durante la descomposición radioactiva alfa en los minerales en las rocas. Rápidamente escapa y entra a la atmósfera mucho más rápido de lo que puede escapar de la gravedad Terrestre. Aún si Dios hubiera creado la Tierra sin helio, la cantidad diminuta que existe hubiera tomado cerca de dos millones de a?os para acumularse. Esta observación indica que la edad máxima es mucho menor a los supuestos 3,000 millones.|`|8ff0b197a40ba640451aecaa8f6f2554aa	Ni caso a la respuesta pseudocientífica de josep7.<br>  <br>  Hay evidencia suficiente de que la Tierra tiene aproximadamente unos 4600 mill. de a?os.<br>  <br>  Para conocer esta edad se ha empleado la técnica de datación radiométrica isócrona Plomo/Plomo en rocas terrestres así como en meteoritos.

HTmj2BXDaa	Depends on how well they are tied.  Since the legs are long, when the leg is moving relative to the body, the speed is faster the farther down the leg you go, fastest at the foot.  At the moment of impact on the body, the leg is still moving in the direction and at the speed it was moving.  If the body was moving fast and came to an abrupt stop (say because it hit a light pole), the leg gets whipped because it is (hopefully) still connected to the body.|`|T3AYLMg3aa	Maybe the shoes are trying to run away. lol|`|yQGpVGu5aa	because dane cook said so.|`|Id1ypViXaa	they were loose|`|Q8fcepcZaa	because they aren't tied tight enough?

This is where a craft travels above the atmosphere for a few minutes before gliding down and landing.  e.g. Virgin Galactic.  Doubtless there will be many more such ventures.  The initial costs of this are predicted to be in the order of ￡100,000.<br>  <br>  However, getting into orbit or beyond is enormously more expensive as it requires much more fuel and sophisticated life-support systems.  While there have been a few space tourists, they have all been extremely rich and paid their way.<br>  <br>  It will be some time before this type of travel becomes affordable to the masses, but I don't doubt it wil come eventually.

bqOvdGXxaa	Thevenin resistance (RTh) is that calculated resistance value that when placed in series with a single calculated Voltage source(VTh) forms a simple equivalent circuit that replaces all the resistors, current sources and Voltage sources in a particular circuit.<br>  <br>  An equivalent resistance is simply the value a single resistor would have to be in order to allow the same amount of current flow between two points in a circuit if it were used alone to replace all the different valued resistors presently existing between the two points.|`|uENe9lZfaa	depending on what you are doing they are nearly exactly the same. \<br>  <br>  the idea of thevinin resistance is to Blackbox a circuit, to make things simple.<br>  <br>  for example if I wanted to take a whole complicated circuit and see what kind of voltage and current I could get out of it by connecting it to another circuit, for example i wanted to connect one circuit to another by placing it in parallel with a random component in the circuit, I would use the thevinin equivalent to simplify the calculations. <br>  <br>  <br>  equivelent resistance of a circuit, is if you have a resistor network that you want to look as one resistor, thevenin resistance means you have a voltage or current source in the circuit.

AA10335036	Yes, if your definition of activity is the number of events per unit time or Becquerels, divided by the number of atoms or moles of the decaying element. This is distinguished from specific activity, which is the number of events per unit time divided by the mass of the decaying element. A lower halflife does generally equate to higher specific activity, but doesn't necessarily since the atomic weight is a factor in the calculation of specific activity.

bMzPXSwWaa	It's hard to answer this question since there are many "names" for a certain spaceship (callsigns, mission names...) .  But basically you have Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.  Then you could consider SkyLab and the International Space Station as "spaceships" even though they are stations more than ships.  Then of course you have the Space Shuttle and the new spacecraft, Orion.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	I assume that you are actually asking "what are some important spacships names in American history" - I guess spelling isn't taught in schools anymore (and its probably too much work to use Spell Check).<br>  <br>  Important spaceship names depends on what you mean by spaceship - do you mean a specific ship, or programs?<br>  Spacecraft programs were groups of spacecraft under a single "team" name such as:<br>  Mercury<br>  Gemini<br>  Apollo (it was Apollo 11 that first landed men on the moon)<br>  Space Shuttle (STS)<br>  <br>  Individual spaceships that have left Earth to orbit the Earth or travel to the moon have all been within one of these programs.<br>  <br>  To the person that answered "Sputnik" - that was a Russian program, not American.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	IMHO<br>  1) Friendship 7 piloted by Sen John Glenn was one of the most important Spaceship names. You need to remember that having the ability to put a man in orbit around the earth sent two messages to the world during the Cold War era. a) We have the technology for space flight b) we can deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere on hearth.  The Friendship 7 demonstrated America's capability to do so for the first time.  However, my understanding is that the name was chosen to extend the hand of friendship to the world verses one of militaristic domination.<br>  <br>  2) Apollo 11 - The Eagle was the most significant as it was the first time that man had landed on any heavenly body.  Again it was no mistake that they went to the Sea of Tranquility (the peaceful sea). Once they landed they renamed the Eagle to Tranquility Base to indicate again the need for peace during the cold war.  It not only signified their position on the moon but represented the colorless, race-less feeble plea for peace on earth and good will toward all humanity. That moment in time had a profound affect on the world.  For one brief second all of mankind simultaneously felt a great sense of accomplishment, unity as beings, and understanding that there was hope for humanity on the earth. <br>  <br>  Call it propaganda if you want.  I won't deny some of it was in the naming of those craft but the names did have a positive and profound effect on our world.|`|ToGslGb3aa	well some of the American shuttles are:<br>  <br>  Enterprise - never actually flown in space<br>  Endeavour<br>  Discovery<br>  Atlantis<br>  Columbia - broke apart during reentry of Earth's atmosphere, all crew lost<br>  Challenger - exploded during first 2 minutes of liftoff, all crew lost<br>  <br>  Then of course there is the MISSION Apollo 13 where they had the Odyssey/Aquarius <br>  <br>  Sputnik was not an American project, it was a Soviet spacecraft.|`|LM51jhEUaa	sputnik

Your glove, you note, is probably due to be swapped out, the wrist joint feels a bit rough as you rotate your hand - and you look down at the meters for oxygen and power - they seem fine. You tweak the thermostat down a bit as you've got some work to do shortly, unloading some cable from the tractor behind you. <br>  <br>  You turn in a bouncing 'bunny-hop', short puffs of regolith kicking up with each footfall - and you walk back to the tractor, reminding yourself to change the glove and also to replace the filter in the life-support - the background whiff of suit-polymer is overlaid with a hint of sweat - you're looking forward to a shower after this shift.<br>  <br>  You reach the tractor, reach for the release arm, fighting the pressure of the suit, and haul down on it with all your weight - which isn;t quite enough - so you brace your other arm against the platform and pull - soundlessly the cable spool clamp comes loose, and you start hauling cable out to the drill site.<br>  <br>  Without a suit:<br>  <br>  Your breath explosively rushes from your lungs in a sharp pulse of pain - you barely notice the sensation of your skin being tugged in all directions - the intense agony in your ears fills your mind as the last oxygen is dragged from your bloodstream by the vacuum of space.

Without proper protection, your skin would get burnt from the Sun and you would go blind if instantly if you try to stare at it (on the sunlit side of the moon).

ycbkzprjaa	Assuming the solar panel is fixed in place, the sun's intensity is max when it is overhead. Then as it sets, the intensity goes down for two reasons. First is when the sun is low in the sky, it must go through more atmosphere to get to that panel. That decreases the intensity. Second is when the sun gets low toward the horizon, each square foot of sunlight gets spread out over a larger area, thus the panel (with a fixed area) will get an effective less amount of energy from that square foot of sunlight.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	The amount of energy is dependent on the surface area *perpedicular* to the incoming light angle.<br>  <br>  Think of a line on the ground 1 meter long. It absorbs all the light that strikes it because it's at 90° already. Now turn it 60° upwards. The x-coordinate of the line is now 1/2.<br>  <br>  From a top-down view, the sun only sees a line that is 1/2m long (from the side it is still 1meter, see?). So only half as much light strikes the line as it did when it was perpendicular.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd explain more in detail but I'm afraid it'd be confusing as it's college level Mechanical Engineering course (Heat Transfer, 3rd year course).|`|eFMrzJOAaa	Take a torch light and card board sheet.Hold the sheet vertically and hold light few inches away from the board.Now switch on,u will get a circular light pattern and this gives maximum inetsity.Again hold the board at an angle and switch on light.U will get an elliptical pattern of light which has more area.So the same light is distributed to a large area, intensity is reduced.<br>  Same wAY, sUN LIGHT IN VERTICAL ANGLE GIVES MORE HEAT AND LIGHT, INCLINED ANGLE GIVES LESS HEAT.

k5Ece8BTaa	There are billions of stars in our universe. The life of a star is quite fascinating. Stars first start out as nebula, prostar, main sequence star, and either it turns into a super giant or a red giant, depending on the mass. Then it's fate depends on rather it's a high mass star or low mass star. So, high mass stars supernova which means they explode. Low mass stars collapse from being a red giant into a white dwarf. And so after the high mass star supernovas it turns into a black hole and remains of nebula are left behind. Low the mass stars that turned into a white dwarf it just continues dying of and dims out and it turns into a black dwarf. <br>  <br>  I also know that really hot stars are blue and stars that are cooler are red. Stars are made out of plasma which is held together by it's own gravity. Stars are classified differently like for example:<br>  <br>  Class O Star's have a temperature of 33,000 K or more. Class B stars are 10,500–30,000 K. Class A stars are 7,500–10,000 K. Class F stars are 6,000–7,200 K. Class G stars are 5,500–6,000 K, and our sun is a class G. Class K are 4,000–5,250 K and Class M stars are 2,600–3,850 K. The K's that are in here represent the temperature of a star. So, stars are also classified using the HR diagram which helps people when they are studying stars.<br>  <br>  I also know that a star's brightness is represented by Luminosity.|`|mBsL0azYaa	I could, but there is so much on the internet already you can research.

5H7Wgaknaa	Galactic alignment is an invention by a bunch of crackpots in order to conjure up some sort of 'event' for 2012. Since they seem unable to provide a concise definition, we'll have to try and guess what they mean.<br>  Could it be the Sun aligning with the centre of the Milky Way galaxy? Well, no because the centre of the Milky Way is not in the plane of the Earth's orbit, so the Sun can never line up with it.<br>  Could they mean the Sun crossing the equator of the Milky Way? The Sun does a complete circuit of the sky every year and therefore appears in line with the Milky Way in June and December every year. So that can't be right.<br>  What about the once in 26,000 year alignment of the solstice point with the galactic equator? Nope, that took place in 1998.<br>  All the preceding are merely line-of-sight effects as seen from the earth's perspective. An observer on Mars would see something completely different. Some of the cranks have become confused and decided that galactic alignment must be something to do with the revolution of the whole solar system around the galaxy, taking 225 million years. During this orbit, the solar system bobs up and down a few times and measurements taken from the Hipparcos satellite reveal that the solar system is currently moving away from the central plane of the galaxy and won't pass through it for another 30 million years or so. That can't be what they mean then.<br>  So we have: 1) Can't ever happen 2) Happens every year 3) Happened in 1998 or 4) Won't happen for 30 million years.<br>  Take your pick.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	There is no galactic alignment.  One of the claims of the 2012 hoaxers is that the Sun will align with the center of the galaxy in 2012.  This is not true.<br>  Another claim is that the planets will align at that time.  It is also untrue.  The only planetary alignments we have are what appear to be alignment in our view of the sky.  This is not an alignment in space and has no effect on us.<br>  <br>  "First of all, it is impossible for all the planets to form a straight line out from the Sun (or viewed superimposed on each other in the sky) because each planetary orbit is tilted slightly (and sometimes not slight at all in the case of Pluto) (no longer a planet, but still in the Solar System) with respect to the Earth's orbit (whose plane we trace out on the night sky as a line completely around the sky and is called the ecliptic). These zealots confuse the term planetary alignment with the more accurate words that should be used, planetary configuration or a loose grouping of the planets in the sky. Actually the event that occurred in 1983 was that the planets (all eight of them -- we are on the ninth, Earth) would be within 96° of each other in the sky -- not in a straight line as most people would misinterpret with the term alignment.<br>  <br>  The last series of planetary configurations or perhaps more accurately called multiple planetary conjunctions occurred in the year 2000. Did the Earth tilt over? No. Did tidal forces trigger earthquakes? No. Did the polar ice caps melt? No. Were you even be able to see the conjunctions? Not really."|`|W2suykEtaa	they lied.<br>  <br>  it should make you upset that someone pretended to be explaining something and lied to you instead.<br>  <br>  there is no particular alignment, no more so than any Dec 21, but even if every planet lined up perfectly in a row with the line pointing right at the center of the Milky Way... just WTF do you expect to happen?<br>  <br>  sheeesh.

hIzQyflqaa	i think they are cousins!|`|X0e6p9Ilaa	Ayeyo, have you got a drawing board?   Because you need to go back to it.<br>  <br>  "Oxidation" and "reduction" are about the gain or loss of electrons, not just hydrogen and oxygen.  Lots of elements can be either oxidized or reduced.   Together, oxidation and reduction reactions (which always come in pairs) are known as redox reactions.  You need to read up on redox reactions.<br>  <br>  You also need to be more specific about what kind of system you're dealing with.  "Anaerobic refers to a lack of oxygen, but there can still be redox reactions without oxygen being involved.<br>  <br>  From your second statement it looks like you may have CO2 dissolved  in water.  Carbon dioxide and water react like this:<br>  <br>  CO2(aq) + H2O(l) <==> H+ + HCO3^- ... Ka = 4.4 x 10^-7<br>  <br>  As we can see from the value of the equilibrium constant, at equilibrium the reaction lies far to the left, meaning that the CO2 exists as CO2 in solution.  According to Le Chatelier's princople, adding CO2 in solution will shift the equilibrium to the right, increasing the concentration of H+.  Increasing the hydrogen ion concentration will make the solution more acidic.<br>  <br>  But this is a simple weak acid / weak base reaction, it's not a redox reaction.  There is no oxidation or reduction.<br>  <br>  Now.  Where's that drawing board?

The digits are independent of each other.  That is, the choice of one doesn't affect the choices of the others, so to get the total number of sevenless 3-digits numbers, you multiply.<br>  <br>  8x9x9 = 648 sevenless three-digit numbers<br>  <br>  so the number of numbers with at least one seven is 900-648=252<br>  <br>  The latter question is much the same.  The total number of numbers from 5000 to 6999 is 6999-4999=2000.<br>  <br>  The number of 3-less such numbers can be constructed this way ... the first digit can be 5 or 6, 2 choices.  The other digits can be any of 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 or 9 choices.  The total of 3-less numbers is 2x9x9x9 = 1458 so the total of threeish numbers is 2000-1458= 542.<br>  <br>  Any questions?

(Son los hongos que aparecen comunmente en los alimentos, sobre todo limones o naranjas). El micelio posee estructuras llamadas "hifas" las cuales pueden o no ser septadas (divididas). Ejemplos de hongos filamentosos: Penicillium sp., Aspergillus flavus, etc.<br>  Las levaduras son menos complejas y no poseen micelios, sus colonias típicas son como las de las bacterias y se usan mucho en la fermentación de bebidas alcohólicas, por ejemplo, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <br>  Ambos crecen en ambientes ácidos y son organismos psicrótrofos, es decir, crecen a temperaturas bajas (-5 a 5 oC), aun cuando su temperatura óptima de crecimiento sea alrededor de los 18 oC.<br>  Si te refieres a hongos macroscópicos, la diferencia principal radica en que éstos son precisamente grandes, (setas por ejemplo), además de que son heterótrofos (su energía la obtienen a partir de otros organismos porque no son capaces de sintetizar sus propios alimentos), existen algunos comestibles, el principal componente de su pared celular es quitina y son organismos eucariotes (con célula y núcleos definidos) a diferencia de las levaduras.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	La levadura es un hongo unicelular, la diferencia con los hongos pluricelulares es precisamente que mientras la levadura está formada por una sola célula y se divide mediante gemación, los hongos pluricelulares se forman por hileras de células y pueden formar la fase vegetativa o micelio o cuerpos fructíferos, cosa que no sucede con las levaduras.|`|bcb2b0d206f683e024c087f4f0fff401aa	me contestas esta porfavor <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhMglGhoGSnptEULgB8wAthD9At.?qid=20070201125707AAEeps8">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|5fd96727cd5d061f04c837113b6f149faa	Mira todo es parte del reino Fungi  lo que pasa es que hay una ambigüedad en la palabra hongo<br>   El reino fungi estaría formado por  los" fungi microscópicos y los fungi macroscópicos " Los microscópicos  esta formado por levaduras y mohos en la que la diferencia es es que las levaduras  son esféricas mientras que los mohos  producen un micelio, además de estructura de la colonia etc. es decir morfología.<br>  <br>  Mientras que los "macroscópicos"  lo forman cetas  y lo que cotidianamente se le llama hongo.|`|770a120fa278b20b4b3fb9b754f035bbaa	la verdad no se , pero en mi heladera tenes varios espécimenes si los queres......|`|xgypvJ5Daa	Las levaduras son hongos, microscópicos, pertenecientes al grupo de los hongos ascomicetes.

Y no, no surge en las etapas primarias una célula de la nada, según Oparin los seres vivos se originaron a partir de la evolución química de moléculas que se encontraban en la superficie terrestre, en una especie de sopa primitiva, que con ayuda de la energía y cuya duración fue de aproximadamente mil millones de a?os, permitió la síntesis de compuestos como los carbohidratos, los lípidos, las proteínas y los ácidos nucléicos, que a través de una serie de ensayos químicos, permiten el aislamiento del medio de sistemas autorreplicativos y así se origina la primera célula, que era muy parecida a las bacterias heterótrofas actuales, y entonces si, a partir de una evolución de mas o menos otros mil millones de a?os, surgen los primeros organismos procariotes (sin núcleo) fotosintéticos, parecidos a las cianobacterias actuales. Ellos permitieron así el desarrollo de una atmósfera con oxígeno que a su vez permitió la evolución no solamente en el mar, sino la conquista de la Tierra.<br>  Surgimiento del Planeta Tierra hace 4600 millones de a?os aproximadamente<br>  Surgimiento de las primeras células en el planeta, procariotes y heterótrofas hace 3500 millones de a?os aproximadamente<br>  Surgimiento de las primeras bacterias fotosintéticas hace 2500 millones de a?os. <br>  ?Pruebas científicas? Los registros fósiles de Warraona, Australia  edad 3500 millones de a?os antes de Cristo, los estromatolitos marinos de Guerrero *****, en Baja California Sur, que son comunidades bacterianas parecidas a las que debieron existir en las primeras épocas del desarrollo de la vida sobre la Tierra, edad 3400 millones de a?os. Los experimentos de Miller, han sido dise?ados exclusivamente para reproducir la atmósfera y la sopa primitiva terrestre, logrando producir moléculas como carbohidratos, lípidos, algunos polipéptidos y peque?os ácidos nucleícos.

There are minimum and maximum falls for any given diameter of sewer / drain pipe.<br>  <br>  In simple terms - the manhole is there for a reason - building over it (unless you do maintain access) is not a good idea. Moving it could cost quite a bit - I doubt you'd see much change out of ￡5,000<br>  Depending on how far you have to relay the pipes either side - it could easily be more....

RgSCstkAaa	Take the timer apart and identify the sounder, which will not look like a regular loudspeaker, but is a small round disc fed by two wires. There may be solder tags on this item (it is actually a piezoelectric transducer) or at the other ends of the wires. Solder wires to these two points and bring them out of the casing. These are to go to the input of a powered speaker, such as any computer loudspeaker, or any other amplifier/speaker combination you have. You will need an amplifier, because the original timer will not have sufficient power for a proper loudspeaker. If you use a computer loudspeaker, you will need either a socket to match the little jack plug or to cut the plug off and solder directly. I recommend getting a line socket to match the plug, which has 3 contacts. The tip is one channel input, the next is the other channel input and the last is the common earth. Solder one of your wires to the 2 socket tags corresponding to channel inputs, and the other one to the common earth tag.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	there are all sorts of kitchen timers.

5X5PrWR6aa	Drainage basins have been important historically in determining boundaries, particularly in regions where trade by water has been important.<br>  Drainage basins are important elements to consider also in ecology. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and pollutants. Like the water, they get transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.<br>   Basins are economically important because most fossil fuels formed in basins. Coal forms from the remains of swamp plants that accumulated in shallow basins. These remains were subsequently buried and subjected to pressure from overlying deposits, eventually forming coal. Petroleum deposits formed similarly from countless small marine organisms that accumulated on the seabed. Subsequent burial by sediments, and heating, converted these organic remains into oil and gas.<br>  <br>  Drainage basins have become important for economic and land use planning. An entire drainage basin must be considered in planning dams and irrigation works. <br>  hope that helps.<br>   can i have best answer|`|AA11157530	If you pollute, where does it shoot?

Autostar is quite intuitive in use and makes life easy for you.  Figure out how to use it and let it do the work for you.  It won't take long and will repay the effort very quickly.<br>  <br>  If on the other hand you have bought a model without the Autostar controller you need to know where Saturn is in the sky.

2lQ8DJAcaa	What has changed over the past century is the burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal, wood) to generate electricity, run cars and factories, and heat or cool homes.  These fossil fuels are responsible for about 98% of the U.S. carbon dioxide, 24% of the methane and 18% of the nitrous oxide emissions.  In addition to the burning of fossil fuels, increasing agriculture, deforestation, landfills, industrial production and mining contributes to these emissions|`|J3TGyOnDaa	It started with the Industrial Revolution in England. Coal was burned in prodigious quantities in textile mills, in other kinds of factories and blacksmiths, and in residences.

Tiph3lQcaa	Well, as I said before - I'm afraid it's not a very good scope. But you should be able to see better than what you are describing. Try this: Take it out during daylight hours. Use the lowest power eyepiece (I would always use low power on this scope). Of course, avoid pointing it at the sun, but look at an object on the horizon with it. You should be able to focus it pretty clearly. It may be inverted - that's OK - it's normal. But if you can get it to focus so it's clearly visible, then keep the focus at that setting and keep the eyepiece installed. Wait until darkness falls, then find the Moon, Venus, or Saturn. A slight focus readjustment might be required, but nothing major. What you should see is things like Venus looking small, but sharp and clear. Venus will look like a crescent now. You can probably see Saturn's rings for another month or two before they turn edge on so much that they are invisible. The Moon should look very nice. Best of luck.|`|luYtFLSUaa	If everything looks like a round white globe, either you got a bum deal or you have not properly focused the image. Turn the focus knob until the images are the smallest possible, and adjust slightly for clarity and resolution. Venus , at this time, should look like a little half moon (first quarter moon), stars should just be a point of light with no real apparent size. Start out with your lowest power eyepiece - don't use your highest power until you learn how to focus and use lower power.<br>  <br>  I can only give you pointers; I am not familiar with the name magnicon<br>  <br>  Doc|`|vvqSxBLGaa	Sadly, this is a familiar story.  It sounds like a poor telescope.  There a few things that suggest this. First of all your description of what you can see but also the description of the telescope.  <br>  <br>  Most toy telescopes are 60mm refactors.  That is not to say that there are not serious 60mm scopes out there, but it starts alarm bells ringign straight away.  Additionally, astronomical telescopes are never quoted by their magnification since it is entirely dependent on the eyepiece used.  Finally, it is a brand I have never heard of - you get to know the quality makes after a while, not so cheap Chinese brands.<br>  <br>  How much did you pay for this scope?  Good scopes cost hundreds of dollars - there are no real bargains out there - quality optics cost money, plain and simple.  If you spent under $100, or even under $50, then unfortunately you won't get a lot from this scope since essentially it is nothing more than a toy.

dmRiRUyyaa	Theoretically, there are at least two natural mechanisms to produce polyploidy in plants:<br>  1). The formation of unreduced (2n) gametes during meiosis I through the first division restitution (FDR)  or during meiosis II (second division restitution/SDR). This process may occur in both male or female gametes. When unreduced egg (2n) is fertilized by unreduced pollen (2n) it will produce tetraploid (4n). Unreduced pollens and eggs have been found in potato and other plants.<br>  2). Through chromosome doubling. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a allohexaploid plant (2n=6x). It has been believed to be formed from the cross involving three different species followed by chromosome doubling.

6qsTmMQaaa	I did some research over the Internet, and the best answer I can come up with as to why light is faster than sound is that the speed that sounds travels at depends on the density of the air, and the density of air depends on the temperatureof the air. Thus, sound travels at a lower rate of speed than light, depending on the temperature, unless it is extremely hot outside. The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters-per-second (m/s), which is approximately 186,000 miles per second. This speed is usually the same, no matter the temperature or density of the air when light is traveling through it. The speed is sometimes reduced when traveling through media that have particles containing mass, as it will bounce off of the particles. The speed reduction, as far as I know, is not significant. Sound waves travel at a lower rate of speed due to the fact that the speed sound travels at depends on the density of air, and the density of air depends on the temperature. I found a website that allows you to calculate the speed of sound. The "speed of sound calculator" allows you to enter a certain temperature in Fahrenheit, Celcius, Kelvin or Rankine, and it will convert the temperature degree into five measurements of speed. According to the website, which is in the Sources box, the hotter the temperature, the faster the speed of sound.|`|NmzWCCdLaa	Im sorry to say but i dont think that anyone knows, this is a bit like asking why 1 plus 1 is 2.

The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information. DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints or a recipe, or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.<br>  <br>  Chemically, DNA consists of two long polymers of simple units called nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called bases. It is the sequence of these four bases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA, in a process called transcription.<br>  <br>  Within cells, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. These chromosomes are duplicated before cells divide, in a process called DNA replication. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store their DNA inside the cell nucleus, while in prokaryotes (bacteria and archae) it is found in the cell's cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

Since heat loss is proportional to surface area the small surface area (about 1fm2 I think) will make heat dissipation very challenging|`|M9JcanLKaa	To talk of a computer chip infers similar technology to that currently in use and that cannot get down to the size of an atom. The key to computer chips is that they can exist for a sustained time in a number (most cases just 2) different states and there are millions of these switches on a chip. Although an atom can exist in different energy states they always revert to their lowest states without external intervention and their alternative states are not stable enough. And when you have cracked that one you still only have one switch.<br>  <br>  It is far more likely that computers will evolve in a different direction (quantum computing perhaps) that will make today's computer look like an abacus.<br>  <br>  When all is said and done computers are a means to an end, they do not solve humanities challenges. Unless something else changes fast computers will just make for bigger wars and make the rich richer and the poor poorer.

It involves sending a large (probably unmanned) spacecraft to the asteroid and have it just sit out there in space right next to it. The mass of the spacecraft has enough gravity of its own, tiny as it is, to alter the course of the asteroid just enough to do the job. <br>  <br>  This of course requires a lot of advance warning that the asteroid is coming, if we only have a short time then the only choices left are more drastic. The gravitational tractor idea can only deflect by a fraction of degree angle, the closer an asteroid is to Earth the more angle it has to get pushed. The less time there is the more likely that a nuclear solution becomes necessary. Nuclear would mean exploding a series of large warheads close to the object, but not physically touching it, to push it away.

Above this temperature, the rate of photosynthesis decreases and eventually becomes zero. (because it is past optimum, much like how enzymes work)<br>  <br>  Light intensity - at low light intensities, the rate of photosynthesis increases when light intensity is increased because more light energy can be converted into chemical energy. But at high light intensities, further increases in light intensity have no affect. There is always a maximum that a plant can photosynthesize. <br>  <br>  CO2 concentration - increases in concentration of CO2 cause the rate of photosynthesis to rise. At high carbon dioxide concentrations, further increases in concentration do not affect the rate of photosynthesis. Again, there is a maximum at which the plant can photosynthesize due to the movement of molecules inside the chloroplast cells.

AA11048920	Hi Peanut, I have had MS for 20 years and the myelin in my body is not destroyed and will never be.  If multiple sclerosis destroyed all the myelin in the body, people would be dieing of this disease every day. The truth is that while MS involves an attack of the immune system on the myelin sheath, it rarely destroys it. MS will also not attack the myelin of any of the nerves that are involved in the functioning of any of major organs including the heart and lungs. Consequently it is not fatal. Medical researchers now know that to some degree the body does repair some of the damage done to the myelin by MS in between atacks. MS can interfere to some degree  with just about every function of the body since the attacks on the myelin and resultant temporary or permanant damage interrupt the accurate delivery of messages in between the the brain and the rest of the body.  The truth is however that everyone who has MS has a different experience with the disease so no two cases are the same. The symptoms a person gets all depends upon what nerves the immune system decides to attack and to what degree it attacks them.   Also, most  of us have a form of the disease which is relapsing remitting.  In other words it comes and goes. So while a person with MS could be blind in one eye and have difficulty walking and talking, the next month they could very well be fine. As a consequence there is not and never will be any set, standard   treatment for  patients with MS. The only thing that a caretaker of a person with MS can do is to interveiw the patient and talk to their doctor to see what symptoms the patient is havng at that particular time. The nervous system is involved in cognition, short term memory, and the emotions as well as the physical. So pyhsical problems are only a part of what you need to find out when doing an intervew with someone with MS. In general and ususlly (but not always) multiiple sclerosis causes severe disabilities if a patient has had a progressive form of the disease for decades.  There are no less than 50 symptoms of MS including but not limited to visual distortion, blindness, difficulty or inability  to walk , talk ,  swallow, grasp, bend or squat; fatigue, depression, imbalance, headaches, pain, hearing problems, perceptual difficulties, loss of short term memory, inability to problem solve, lowered IQ, extreme mood swngs and hearing problems.|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	You need to be doing your own homework.

rCXF3zIxaa	I will take it that you mean the phospholipid bilayer?<br>  <br>  In which case, the bilayer's main function (obvious though it may seem) is to separate cell contents from its surroundings. It can do this because of the hydophobic lipase 'tails' and the hydrophilic phosphate 'heads'.<br>  <br>  It also controls movement of substances in/out of the cell. Some very small molecules can diffuse straight through, but others require facilitated diffusion. So the bilayer contains channel and carrier proteins which allow facilitated diffusion and active transport to occur.

b8yhcxmRaa	In animals, adipose, or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. Depending on current physiological conditions, adipocytes store fat derived from the diet and liver metabolism or degrade stored fat to supply fatty acids and glycerol to the circulation. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (i.e., insulin, glucagon and epinephrine). The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: "Visceral fat" is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas "subcutaneous fat" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but above the abdominal muscle wall). Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (ie, hormones), among which are several which are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is resistin which has been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.<br>  <br>  Adipose Tissue is a loose fibrous connective tissue packed with many cells (called "adipocytes") that are specialized for storage of triglycerides more commonly referred to as "fats".<br>  <br>  Each adipocyte cell is filled with a single large droplet of triglyceride (fat). As this occupies most of the volume of the cell, its cytoplasm, nucleus, and other components are pushed towards the edges of the cell - which is bounded by the plasma membrane (also known as the <br>  <br>  The Functions of adipose tissue<br>  - Adipose tissue acts as an insulating layer, helping to reduce heat loss through the skin. <br>  - It also has a protective function, providing mechanical protection ("padding") and support around some of the major organs, e.g. kidneys.<br>  - Adipose tissue is also a means of energy storage. Food that is excess to requirements is converted into fat and stored within adipose tissue in the body. <br>   <br>  White adipose tissue (WAT) occurs in virtually all vertebrates.  WAT had been considered to occur almost universally in the animal body and is fully recognized as an anatomically organized tissue with site-specific properties. <br>  <br>  Unilocular white adipocytes are simple by their structure, store large amounts of excess energy and deliver fatty acids to other tissues as required. Despite of its simple structure, WAT performs numerous functions in the body that are related but not necessarily restricted with its anatomical locations, such as the provision for lactation. <br>  <br>  The recently discovered secretory product of white adipocytes, leptin, has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of body weight and the total amount of adipose tissue in the body. Leptin is expressed by the ob gene, which has extensive homology among vertebrates. Fasting and weight loss decrease the level of leptin in circulation, and weight gain and overfeeding increase it.  The exact mechanism of the effect of leptin is not known. The sympathetic nervous system is proposed to play a key role in the regulation of leptin levels, possibly by downregulating leptin production via β3-adrenoceptors.  Reduced blood leptin and insulin levels presumably increase the activity of anabolic neural pathways in the brain to boost appetite and feed intake, and thereby aim to restore energy homeostasis.<br>  <br>  Besides leptin, WAT also secretes a large number of other signals that affect energy homeostasis. These include pro-inflammatory cytokines, regulators of lipoprotein metabolism and growth factors, among others. Catecholamines, insulin and the sympathetic nervous system that modulate the adipocyte function also influence efferent signalling of adipose tissue. WAT is thus increasingly being recognised as an active endocrine and paracrine organ, that closely interacts with other organs and tissues, and enables the organism to adapt to a wide range of metabolic challenges.

The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same.

acbqsZZbaa	Mitochondria certainly divide, and they do contain a circular strand of DNA which encodes many (but not all) of the proteins necessary to make the mitochondrion. There is no debate about the fact that mitochondria divide, so all you will find on the web is the statement that mitochondria divide. If you want to go to the original source of the evidence you are going to have to go to a science library and look at research papers, or order some online. There are thousands of papers on the subject.<br>  The most glaring piece of evidence to support it is that our mitochondrial DNA comes entirely from our mothers. This is because the mitochondria of the sperm do not enter the egg during fertilisation.<br>  <br>  The links are quite detailed. The second shows electron micrographs of mitochondria dividing.

As far as what they breath, this is the most interesting part; they breath oxygen and let of Co2 as we do. Fungi are more closely related to animals than they are related to plants, that is pretty neat since they were originally thought to be in the plant family.

We tend to get this input around farming areas due to runoff which carries these nutrients.
xTioPxaVaa	Are we talking electric or acoustic?  There are different principles at work in each one.<br>  <br>  With an acoustic guitar, the greater the picking force on the string, the more energy that's put into the string.  After picking the string, that energy is transferred to the top of the guitar, which resonates with the pitch.  How the rest of the guitar interacts acoustically is dependent on the physical construction, but that's the general idea.  Pick harder, play louder.<br>  <br>  With electric guitars, the more energy that put into the string the louder the signal is from the guitar, but for different reasons.<br>  <br>  An electric guitar's pickup places a magnetic field around the string.  From basic AC we know that when lines of magnetic force are cut, a voltage is induced.  The more lines that are cut, the greater the magnitude.  And the faster they are cut, the higher the frequency of the output signal.  So again, pick harder and you get a louder signal.  This time though, it's not as much about acoustic energy in the guitar as much as electrical energy you're sending to an amplifier.<br>  <br>  Of course, with the electric, you have the luxury of a volume control on the amp as well!<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken|`|4OnlAEQuaa	their is a tunner, and the tighter u pull the string the sharper the sound.

Ftkr9jqYaa	In ecology and Earth science, a biogeochemical cycle or nutrient cycle is a pathway by which a chemical element or molecule moves through both biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. In effect, the element is recycled, although in some cycles there may be places (called reservoirs) where the element is accumulated or held for a long period of time. Elements, chemical compounds, and other forms of matter are passed from one organism to another and from one part of the biosphere to another through the biogeochemical cycles.<br>  <br>  Whether discussing harmful elements (such as uranium, arsenic, or mercury) or common elements (such as carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen), biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, and the study of these cycles is inherently multidiciplinary. Hydrology, Geology, Pedology (soil study), Atmospheric Sciences, Ecology, and many other disciplines need to be addressed in a full description of a particular cycle.<br>  <br>  Harmful elements follow or undergo biogeochemical cycles as well as other elements.  However, because of their relative toxicity, the may remain in reservoirs for much longer periods of time than benign chemicals.  Such reservoir stagnation occurs because of the mortality of organisms exposed to harmful chemicals.  If few or no biota survive when exposed to a harmful element, then the element can only be transported from the reservoir abiotically (e.g., via erosion or wind movement), so the element is likely to remain in the reservoir.<br>  <br>  The primary difference between the cycling of a harmful element and a more benign element is that accumulation can increase when moving between each trophic level.  Consequently, the concentration of a harmful element, such as mercury, can increase by as much as tenfold between the producer (i.e., a plant species) level and a primary consumer.  Tissue concentrations of harmful chemicals, typically measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb), can increase by as much as 1000% between primary and secondary consumers, and can be further magnified when secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers.  As a result, top predators, who often are regarded as keystone species, may have such large accumulations of harmful elements that they are dangerous for human consumption.  One example of a keystone species with high mecury levels is the tuna fish, which people are advised to eat in moderation or infrequently, because of the danger of mercury toxicity.

ZN5iGL4waa	Whether or not the math is right, this means of solving the problem doesn't have any real meaning. The apollo spacecraft didn't travel to the moon at a constant speed. They used a transfer orbit which starts out fast and slows down as you go. If we were sending a spacecraft to Uranus, it would have to use a much larger transfer orbit which would start out much faster. Really, we would likely do slingshots around Jupiter and probably Saturn to save on fuel.

I8b66BvSaa	Because they may out-compete another existing species and therefore the original species may die or not be as populous.<br>  <br>  And this could affect alot of other species of plants and animals.<br>  <br>  For instance, introducing beavers into an area may be bad for trees because beavers gnaw on the trees to cut them down for their dams. This would have an effect on birds living in the trees. Also, predators which may be able to kill a beaver would increase in number because there would be more food to eat, and therefore its original prey would decrease in numbers because the amount of predators would increase, with more sources of prey. So, introducing a new species could potentially kill off a whole species who were originally there or force them to move on to a different area.|`|SUs4rN49aa	The new species can be invasive - eating the same type of food that another species already does, causing this species to become extinct, or more directly it could prey on a species causing it's population to extinct. <br>  <br>  With a new species, you just never know the effects it could have since it isn't naturally from that area.|`|BLXwZAfqaa	because there are no natural checks and balances for the new species.

They are invasive, they disrupt the balance of nature. <br>  <br>  Take Zebra Muscles for example. These purify the water in rivers. Removing oxgen from the water as well.THey were introduced a while ago, now they overpopulate the great lakes. Other fish die because they eat algea in the water. And they suffocate. Now those animals die, and Zebra Muscles over populate.<br>  <br>  Plants can do it as well like the tree of Heaven. <br>  <br>  It is quite simple. If those not native to the environment adapt, they will cause the native to die, and they will disrupt the balance. THey should be kept in places they have a predetor, and an environment surrounding them that can cope with their natrual way of life. <br>  <br>  Jope this helped!|`|369Plo3paa	Often, certain species can be invasive. A early example is rats and mice. They mostly come from Asia, but have learned to be close to humans. As a result, they have spread all over the world and can be found anywhere humans are. These rat and mouse populations can often interfere with crops, spread diseases, and force other small native animals out of their homes. In Australia there is a massive feral cat population that threatens wildlife that is unique to that part of the world. Kudzu was once used as filler vegetation but it quickly takes over whole areas, destroying much of the natural plant life. History has shown, its best to just let things be.|`|LKWLuMtCaa	Its bad for the environment because once that species is introduced it may have no natural predators therefore it thrives and may grow to be at the top of the food chain and that causes competition for the animals that were already at the top so the new species may completely take over that ecosystem and other naturally occurring species may even become extinct because they stave to death or are frequently eaten by the new predator.|`|NmzWCCdLaa	This entirely disrupts the balence that has evolved over thousands of years. Suppose there were 3 living species on one island;wolf's , sheep and grass. If we introduced a plant that takes energy from grass like a large tree population then the grass die's. no grass means no food for the sheep, no sheep means no food for the wolves.<br>  <br>  There we go the island is dead apart from some trees.<br>  This hapens a lot of times with animals when they compete for food and space, when grey squirells came to britan they terarised red ones and pushed them to near extintion.<br>  <br>  We should just leave nature alone|`|NdkYyscYaa	because it can eat the food another species eats and then that animal will become endangered or extinct then the animal that eats that animal will become extinct etc.....

pBZLTc6kaa	No.  As you increase in elevation there is less overlying air mass.  Less overlying air mass equates to less pressure.  As pressure decreases it takes it takes colder temperatures to keep things solid.  So if the temperature is the same at 2000 ft and at sea level, the ice at sea level is "harder" because it has more pressure on it keeping the molecules tighter and more solid.

rCXF3zIxaa	Homeostasis is keeping the body's conditions at a regular desired level.<br>  <br>  So when it gets cold, for example, blood vessels near the surface will contract which reduces blood flow through them, thus reducing the amount of heat energy lost from your body. Your breathing rate will also increase to allow for more respiration which produces energy, as you will need more energy as you will lose more to the colder surroundings.<br>  <br>  The opposite is true aswell... when it gets hot your blood vessels dilate to release more heat energy from your body. Breathing rate will also slow down as you have less need for energy from respiration.
NIyyDwNVaa	I'm not 100% sure.<br>  <br>  However in my opinion if you think about a nerve and you increase the size (diameter of axon) you create a less resistant space for the ions to travel and depolarize neighboring channels along an axon.<br>  <br>  Action potential is transmitted across an axon by propagation of the action potential meaning that there are a bunch of voltage gated channels along an axon (each responds to changes in membrane potential) some Sodium ions will move to nearby channels and depolarize.<br>  <br>  Okay with the segueway increasing diameter of an axon will allow ions to travel across neuron without much resistance and thus it increases conduction velocity.<br>  <br>  Myelination creates areas of insulation on axons in neurons. So essentially it will prevent ions from leaking through membrane and it will increase conduction velocity because insulated areas don't have voltage gated channels so the gaps (nodes of Ranvier) between the myelinated (insulated) areas will allow saltatory conduction (action potential jumps from node to node)<br>  <br>  It really helps if you look at a picture|`|0a59616d0e7f84a6e411f50c3cf9f584aa	lol

KHSOVxViaa	Higher temperatures signifies more energetic particles.  Lighter particles would have the highest velocities, and the highest pressure.<br>  <br>  In the early solar system, even before fusion, the hotter part would be towards the nucleus that would become the sun.  This would also be the most dense.  The thermal energy led to a form of pressure (still miniscule), but over time tended to move the lighter particles further out.<br>  <br>  After fusion began, the solar wind added to this effect, adding thermal energy to the particles close to the sun and effectively 'blowing away' the lighter particles.<br>  <br>  This is one of the reasons that the inner planets predominantly consist of heavier particles, while the outer planets got to gorge off the lighter elements during formation.<br>  <br>  The detailed picture is doubtless more complex than this.  If you were to run computer simulations based on a range of initial conditions, there would probably be many variations in the statistical distributions of elements, and the likelihood of what planets forming where.|`|f18e617fe0754473c97b4f67d099bfcdaa	In the outer regions of the Solar Nebula, temperatures dropped enough for everything to freeze or condense out, except for hydrogen and helium. That is why the outer planets and comets have large amounts of ices and hydrogen and helium in the case of Jupiter and Saturn. In the inner core of the Solar Nebula, the growing proto-Sun kept temperatures very high and prevented everything that condensed at a low temperature from condensing out, keep materials such as water, ammonia and methane in a gaseous state. Only rock and metal was able to condense out in the inner Solar Nebula. The effect of temperature was simply that near the Sun only materials that condense at very high temperatures condenses, but far out in the outer reaches of the Solar Nebula, everything condensed except for hydrogen and helium.

At a given velocity and turbulence, the lightest particles are actually suspended in the water. The next group is comprised of smaller rocks that bounce along the bottom, and the largest moving rocks roll along the bottom. Note that the water velocity is usually seasonal, so in one season coarse sand may be suspended, and in another it may merely roll along the bottom. <br>  <br>  I am not actually sure all this is correct, but a geologist specializing in river structures once told me, and he seemed knowledgeable. <br>  <br>  One would think impacts by the larger rolling rocks might take off fairly large pieces or at least crush to small bits and powder, significant areas of the bottom rock, while the smaller rocks bouncing along or the suspended grit would only take off small to tiny dings. <br>  <br>  Since the sizes of the moving rocks would depend heavily on the velocity of the water and the geometry of the bottom these would be important. <br>  <br>  Equally, some rock is more easily broken than other, tougher, rock; and some rock is hard and some soft (not the same exactly as toughness). Large, dense (heavy, more or less), hard, tough, sharply angular, rocks coming downstream impacting on friable (crumbly) soft rocks on the bottom would make for fast abrasion, while the reverse would lead to slow abrasion of the bottom rocks. <br>  <br>  Where I used to live in the Himalayas there was a highwater season and a low water season on the rivers. In the latter flow was pretty slow; the river only had a small channel in the centre of the bed, and there was a large dry area of the riverbed covered with football to larger sized boulders. I don't think very much larger rock was moving down the river. During the season when the winter snows melted and/or the monsoom poured rain on the hills, the rivers were huge roaring torrents covering the whole bed, and I imagine a great deal of large material was being transported along the bottom, so abrasion would have been rapid.<br>  <br>   This said, at least in the low water season, the bedrock at the bottom of the river seemed to be covered with a boulder layer so the bedrock was probably not being much abraded much at all. I don't know whether in peak water the whole boulder field became unstable and rolled downriver, or if it remained locked in place, protecting the bedrock for the most part. I suspect the latter, or erosion would have been very rapid from the impact of the large boulders visible in the low season against the relatively soft bedrock, particularly any projecting parts thereof.<br>  <br>  I am not touching on water chemistry, but in some cases I could see it playing a role.

Like a bicycle pump it forces air out, and a one way valve, or check valve, prevents the pressure leaking back.<br>  As long as it isn't feeding anything the pressure will build up until it reaches a 'safety' pressure. There is a pressure relief valve on the compressor that blows out if the pressure exceeds this safety limit.<br>  Besides the relief valve there is usually an electrical sensor that stops the motor running when a certain limit is reached.

Normally the compressor does not supply the device directly but through a reservoir or a Receiver. This is a tank that stores the air. The tank ensures that there is always supply of air when the compressor is not running or is unavailable. It also evens the flow of air.<br>  There are basically two types of compressors. The first one is a positive displacement compressor. The second type uses fans and can be single stage or multi-staged depending on what the pressure requirements are.<br>  Compressing a gas is hard work compared to pumping a fluid and many compressors are not very efficient. The lower the temperature of the compressed gas the less energy required to pressurize the air. Some compressor incorporate a cooler that increases the efficiency of the compressor.<br>  The pneumatic tool usually has some type of turbine that converts the air pressure into rotary motion. At times a reciprocating motion can be the result as in a jack hammer.<br>  The compressor is normally powered by an electric motor.

pOWk3h2vaa	CH2OH is a primary alcohol so the OH group is on the first or last carbon atom. If you were to draw it, it would look like HO-C-H3... carbon has 4 available bonds, Oxygen takes up one with C and one with H. So the C atom has to have 3 Hydrogens.  <br>  <br>  The OH group is what makes the molecule soluble in water. The electronegativity of O and H differs so much that O is always slightly negative and H is slightly positive. Oxygen is greedy and wants the electrons, so it will have a stronger pull on the hydrogen's electron.<br>  Water is polar, so O is slightly negative and H is slightly positive. The OH group on the alcohol has a slight difference in charge. So the OH group will form a 'hydrogen bond' with the water, O of the OH forms a hydrogen bond to H of the water. H of the OH forms a hydrogen bond to the O of the water. This hydrogen bonding makes the molecule able to be soluble in water.<br>  <br>  Polar just means that there is a pole where it has a slightly positive charge and the other pole has a slightly negative charge. <br>  <br>  Hydrogen bonding occurs between O - H, N - H, or H - F bonds. Molecules that can form hydrogen bonds with water or can accept hydrogen bonds from water, are usually soluble in water because they can form hydrogen bonds with water.<br>  <br>  In the case of CH3CH2, well, first of all, if you drew it, it would look like<br>  3H-C-C-H3 (ethane) or 2H-C = (double bond) C-H2, so C has 4 bonds to 4 elements. (ethene)<br>  <br>  The electronegativity difference between C and H is not so great as the difference between O and H. So the C and H does not have a slight negative or positive charge. Thus the molecule does not have any slight negative or positive charges so it is called a non-polar molecule. <br>  <br>  It will repel the polar water molecule, since the rule is like dissolves like. Non-polar cannot dissolve in polar and vice-versa. Only polar dissovles in polar and non-polar dissolves in non-polar.|`|7zqiwRojaa	(I'm not completely sure... but...)<br>  I think it's because CH3CH2 is non-polar and CH2OH is polar. And water is a polar molecule, so it can attract the CH2OH molecule and cause it to dissolve. In contrast, CH3CH2 doesn't have partial charges associated with it, so it doesn't break up in water.

The reflected ray is then equal in intensity due to conservation of energy. The best mirror (pure silver) is about 98% efficient.<br>  <br>  OK, maybe you mean the reflected and incident *angles* are equal. The first step in learning physics is learning what questions are meaningful to ask. "Equality" in physics is a concept confined to quantities (like angles and intensities), not objects (like light rays). You need to start thinking more clearly about such things if you're going to succeed in physics. Isn't it interesting, though, that the more common an observation is, the more likely you are to get a circular answer in this forum (like the others)? As for the other responders, the second thing to learn is what constitutes a meaningful answer. I group "It is 'cause it is" type answers right along with "God done it". <br>  <br>  The angles are equal for reflection from a mirror because a mirror has an electrically conducting surface which results in zero electric field intensity at the surface, ideally.

That's about as simple as it gets.

eMXIQaQlaa	The base pairs are different shapes, they only fit together a certain way. If you have just a random assortment of base pairs the strand will be nonsense and wont hold the right information and would yield useless or mutated DNA. The DNA strand also would probably not hold together because I believe the base pairs have to be attracted to each other to stay together.<br>  <br>  Also, the bases come in a certain order.

UFteXlqwaa	You can't answer the question using a table, so here it is for you:<br>  <br>  At 20 C, a cubic meter of air can't contain more than 17.3 grams water. It is then saturated. If the relative humidity is then 50%, the air at 6 PM contains half of that, or 8.6 gr/m3.<br>  <br>  At 6 AM, the temperature sank 6 degrees and is now 14 C. My table shows only saturation point for degrees Celsius in steps of 5 degrees so I don't have it for 14 C but for 15 C, it is 12.9 and for 10 C, it is 9.4<br>  <br>  If the absolute humidity is 8.6 gr/m3, then fog won't appear before the temperature is under ten degrees. So the answer is; no, fog won't appear at 6 AM with a temperature of 14 degrees.<br>  <br>  Note that all this is for Standard Atmosphere (SA) which means a pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the average at sea level.

That is why every month we have a few new pharmaceuticals.  Also, the reason they spend so much money researching these drugs is because that is simply how much it costs them.  It would cost just as much to research plants or foods.<br>  <br>  Also, when money is donated to research for a disease, it is not often given to the drug companies.  That money usually goes to teaching hospitals to fund trials and things.<br>  <br>  As for follow-up question about medications coming as tablets so how can they be plants: that's like saying a hamburger is a patty so how can it be from a cow.  If part of a plant is effective, there's no reason a manufacturer can't grind it into a powder and compress it into a tablet.  Which is essentially how herbal supplements are made.  Additionally, if reserachers discover which specific chemical in a plant is effective (isoflavones in soy for example), they would need to figure out how to isolate it and then deliver it to the body.  because your body degrades and metabolizes products they would most likely have to alter the isoflavones (from my previous example) to resist degradation.

WkWedRnoaa	25 words?  Sounds like someone has a small essay to write for a take home quiz or test.  What you're studying is not just about learning details and individual facts, it's about learning to think.  Taking someone's 25 word answer here and using it as your own won't help you to do anything but learn to expect others to do your work for you.  But the US government and most of the states are looking for people like you, people who "need" the government to "give" them houses, food, clothing, utilities, and a line to stand in once or twice a month.  That'll work until people like me get tired of doing all the work and stop doing anything.  Then, when there is no one left for the government to steal from. everyone can starve together and we'll all be just one big happy family.

J3TGyOnDaa	All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same.

F6IOLf3Aaa	Since the cloning of Dolly the sheep, techniques have been significantly improved. As a result, animals are cloned far more successfully today than in the past.<br>  <br>  The key breakthrough came with the discovery that the cell nuclei to be cloned worked better if it was first "forced" out of the normal cell reproductive cycle and into what is known as the G0 phase -- a quiescent phase.  Somatic cell nuclei in this phase dedifferentiate (reprogram their DNA in order to support embryonic development) better when injected into the enucleated egg, than say a somatic cell nuclei in one of the other normal cell cycle phases.<br>  So, that was a big push forward for animal cloning.  However, the technique is still lacking in some fashion. The success rate should be higher than currently.  I believe that the answer to the cloning problem of effective dediffereniation lies within cancer cell cytoplasm. This is especially true for the more aggressive forms of the disease.  Cancer cell cytoplasm almost naturally increases the telemores (segments of DNA at the ends of the chromosomes that influence cellular aging) length, and cancer cytoplasm effectively promotes embryonic gene expression in somatic genomic DNA.  I firmly believe that microinjection or fusion of small amounts of cancer cytoplasm into the enucleated egg along with the presence of the somatic nuclei to be cloned will result in more healthier and longer lived cloned offspring.<br>  <br>  See: List of successfully cloned animals<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_that_have_been_cloned" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ani...</a><br>  <br>  Mice Frozen 16 Years Ago "Resurrected" by Cloning<br>  <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081103-frozen-cloning.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...</a><br>  <br>  ANIMAL CLONING: The Science of Nuclear Transfer<br>  by Joseph Panno, PhD<br>  ISBN: 0-8160-6882-8<br>  <br>  CLONING: Nuclear Transplantation in Amphibia<br>  by Robert Gilmore McKinnell<br>  ISBN: 0-8166-0831-8<br>  <br>  CLONING: The Road To Dolly, And The Path Ahead<br>  by Gina Kolata<br>  ISBN: 0-688-15692-4
