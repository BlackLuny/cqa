You measure the total distance of 10such tape-bare-piece pairs, D. You measure this distance with a ruler to be 27.6cm. You estimate, that you make an error of +- 0.843mm on either end of the ruler. Since you measure actually the difference of two positions, end minus begin, you must calculate the error of this difference D from the equation (delta s = sqrt ((deltaA^2)+(deltaB^2)) , from your error estimates. Then you divide D by the number of tape-bare-piece pairs, in order to get the distance between successive tape-bare-piece pairs, d. What is the relative error of d ?

You can see such a big difference on Google Earth, in border line cities such as El Paso/Juarez, Del Rio/Acuna, San Diego/Tijuana, Brownsville/Matamoros, and many others.      You can see that the US houses are colorful and nice looking, while the Mexican houses are all roofless and made with concrete, with no personality.      Why wouldn't the Mexicans take the example of the US way of building houses just by looking at what they build on the other side of the border?      There is not really such a big architectural difference between Quebec and the US, for example.

Each response must be at least 4 sentences. =/      1. Your teacher walks into the always hot chemistry room, you are sitting in the back of the room, after a few minutes you can smell the perfume your teacher is wearing, explain why.      2. If you have a balloon filled with helium and a second balloon filled with the same amount of nitrogen; a small identical leak occurs in both balloons - which will deflate first and why?      3. Why does ice float on water?      4. Why are there special directions on some baked goods for high altitudes? Would it be easier to make macaroni and cheese in Denver or Wilmington? Explain.      5. What conditions cause a gas to deviate from ideal behavior? Why does this happen?      6. Which would you expect to occupy the most space, 1 gram of liquid water or 1 gram of water vapor? Why?      7. Imagine you have been shrunk down so that you can ride on an ideal gas particle. Please describe the five basic assumptions of the KMT (Kinetic Molecular Theory) from your new perspective.      8. Ethanol and water have different normal boiling points and vapor pressures at the same temperatures. How can you explain that ethanol has a higher vapor pressure while water has a lower vapor pressure at the same temperature? Which substance would have a higher normal boiling point?      9. Please explain why if you cook rice in a pressure cooker you can have finished rice in about 1/3 of the time of cooking it at atmospheric pressure?      10. Your chemistry teacher has just made the statement that when you ice skate you are really ice skating on liquid water, Assume he is correct. Using the phase diagram of water, please explain this phenomenon.      11. Which would you rather have a burn from, water at 100° C or a burn from steam at 100° C? Why?            You dont have to answer all if them, but as many as you can answer would be great! The person who answers most an is thorough (more than 4 sentences) gets the 10 points!  :)      Thanks!

20090222155556AALTMpH	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How apart is the sunrise in the sky on Dec.21 from the sunrise on Mar 21?	noticed that it rises and sets at an angle in winter and not a straight east to west direction.      i am imagining that it does this on Mar 21 and Sept. 21 rougly in the northern hemisphere. (though would like another confirmation on this)   and slowly rises and sets further north after Mar21 and rises at its furthest north on Jun21 and then slowly comes back south again and rises it in the furthest south on Dec.21 . and the angle that it rises and sets is diagonal meaning that it appears to travel over the sky in an angle.         so my question is this:  how much of an angle differance is it roughly does it rise on Dec 21 than it does on Mar  21 and then again on Jun 21 ?and does this depend on how far latitude you are in northern hemisphere?  i am imagining it wont be too much.         please describe and explain.

20090222152836AARdaJk	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	How are pH and oxygen related?	How are pH and oxygen related?      My hypothesis first is: In the process of reduction, a substance gains hydrogen and loses oxygen. Therefore, in an anaerobic environment, there is more hydrogen and oxygen. Since there is more hydrogen, the pH is more acidic.      My second hypothesis is: The concentration of H+ ions in a solution increases as the CO2 level increases. The less oxygen, the less CO2, since oxygen is an element in the CO2 compound. The less CO2, the less H+, which means a higher pH.      Which one is correct?      Or are they both wrong?

20090222100245AAusWTv	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Can you build over a large deep manhole?	I am needing a little advice. I am seriously thinking of building an extension the full width at the side of my house. My toilet waste pipe comes out of the side and goes directly in a straight line to the public sewer in the road (this distance is approx 12ft) before the boundary of my fence. I then have a 2/3ft pavement then road.  I have two manhole covers.  The first one is an inspection shoot which Building regs said I could seal over. The main problem is I have a very large manhole at the very end of my property where the wall of the extension would go. The man hole is 7ft deep from the top beside the cover to the bottom and maybe about 5ft long heading directly back towards the house (towards the littler manhole inspection shoot) . It is my own private sewer, the other houses have their own. I don't like the idea of having a manhole in the extension so think I would need to move it or build around it, like a chimley breast. It is such a big cellar type square with metal rod ladders I wonder whether I could actually build over it or if it would need to be moved. It is basically at the boundary of my property just before it joins the road. The public footpath is only 2/3ft wide so it is very near the road. Any advice would be very welcome and also an idea of how expensive this thing would be to move.  Are we talking a few thousand pounds (more or less). If I did need to move it, the problem would be there is nowhere else to put it on my existing sewer pipe as no more land left the only alterantive I see would be to create another manhole further away say approx 15ft using a "Y" section method, is this costly? Help!!!!

20090222123020AAiL7F0	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Is it paranormal that a full blown atheist make it to heaven or transcend to higher dimensions in time?	Perhaps in time, lots of time.   These are most of the spirits-ghost that are trapped in the earths lower dimensions.....if you don't believe your dead you don't transcend, so basically if you don't believe you go anywhere, why would you transcend somewhere like heaven. These are the ghost on earth, they are mostly atheist type people stuck because they don't believe they have a spirit or go anywhere.   In time some spirits do learn, and can move on, but it takes many of them a very long time, some can be guided, if they only listen.      What do you think, be nice now!

20090222142023AAWiPQn	Science & Mathematics;Biology	PLEASE HELP Genetics!! =)?	In a population of rats there is a condition known as terminal haemorraghic syndrome (TMS) which producers profuse bleeding in the spleen and mesentery. It is caused by a recessive gene and is invariably fatal. In a breeding colony of 400 animals, records show that 48 have died due to TMS.   Calculate how many animals are carriers of the gene and how many are true breeding for the dominant allele?   Comment on the likely effectiveness of a breeding programme to eradicate TMS from the colony? THANKYOU =)

20090222142835AAlQWFf	Science & Mathematics;Physics	-----Wind Turbine Data-----?	Im doing Physics AS Level Coursework and for part of my write up i need to comment on wind turbines, and talk about data taken from a mini investigation regarding them.      We conducted a investigation as such in college, but the data returned was not very useful, so i am wondering if anyone has or can point me to some useful data about windturbines.      I am looking for data about the enerygy output depending on how many blades are used, what angle the blades are placed at and what shape the blades are.   There does not need to be much data just enough for me to write a couple of paragraphs about.      Many Thanks.
