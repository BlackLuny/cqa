20090224231733AAzxQ5J	Local Businesses;United States;Other - US Local Businesses	My international package is in the wrong city about an hour away. Is there anything I can do? (USPS)?	Delivery was attempted at (My address) but in a different city/zip combo (the same street and house number is in a different city about an hour away). However, the house rejected the package today (logically). Is there anything I can do to tell the post office they are delivering it to the wrong place before they ship it back to the other side of the world (hong kong) and then let the person ship it back to me yet again (and wait 3 weeks for a part that I am desperately needing)???      Thanks!

20090224223028AAvbWxP	Local Businesses;United States;Sacramento	So I got caught stealing a muffin at winco....?	and yeah I do feel like a loser and I feel pretty emabarassed but this is what happened.         I shopped at this Winco for over a year now. I never stole anything over there intill recently actually. well it started when I was getting donuts in the morning for breakfasts over there. after I have grabbed a few donuts I went to the cashier to pay for it. but the cashier said "oh just take those" so basically this guy wanted me to have it for free for some reason so I assumed the donuts and the muffins they sold didn't really matter to them. I walked out. nobody cared and nothing went off. I felt lucky getting the donuts for free.      So about a few weeks later I grabbed another donut, but the line was really really big and I didn't want to wait in line. so I decided to go through the line and walk out with the unpaid donut. but nobody cared and nobody noticed. Yeah I know, its very wrong for me to steal in the first place.      and I done this a few more times and nobody ever confronted me about it or seem to care and I know they throw the unsold donuts away at the end of the day. and the donuts and muffins are only like 50 cents to a dollar so I figured why the hell would they even care and bother confronting me over a donut? the winco I go to its always so packed and crowded and they probably make so much money.      So I probably stole like 6 muffins total in the past few months. but I didn't just steal from there, I bought things but when it came to donuts I just simply take it and sneak out with those but I only done it a few times.      So today for some stupid reason i decided that I wanted a muffin. My intention was to actually pay for it this time but yet again the lines were so huge so I decided that I wanted to walk out, but...when I was walking out, I felt that somebody was watching me from behind, like maybe somebody was on to me, at this point I should have either taken the Muffin back or paid for it, but like an idiot I didn't even think much of it. I went to go wait in line so I didn't seem suspicious. then all a sudden I decided to head to the door. I thought yet again I gotten away with it. so I decided to get a soda out of the soda machine which was right by the entrance. then.......      A co-worker was right beside me and said "ok, where is muffin" I was like "what?" then the guy said "I am not dumb. empty your pockets" it wasn't in my pocket I had it in my hand he just didn't see it. then he said "did you pay for that?" "I told him no I didn't, I'm sorry" then I gave him a dollar. The muffin was 80 cent" so I paid him and said "ok I paid for it" then he said " Don't come back" I said "look, I'm really sorry, I'll pay for next time, I won't steal it ever again" but it didn't work. he just said "no. get lost. don't come back" I explained to him that I did it because the line was so big and that I I didn't think it was a huge deal, he told that doesn't justified what I did and he was right.a few people shook there heads at me. I felt so ashamed and felt like such a loser...      I know what I did is wrong and I am not making any excuses. I know stealing is wrong and I felt like such a loser. well, I know I will never be doing that ever again. I didn't get in trouble but I would really like to continue shopping at the store....      but why do you think he reacted that way? why did he bother confronting a person that is only stealing a 80 cent muffin?      but yeah, I hope I can go back there someday and he doesn't remember, but what would happen if go back there? surely they won't go through the trouble to bring me to court over a few muffins I stole....      Do you think the guy noticed I stole them the last few times? what was going through his mind the whole time??      and yeah I feel bad. I will never do that again. ever. but I just didn't think it was a huge deal

Looking back, for 6 months before that my bills were 0 !   What does the Maharashtra State Electricity Board rule book say? Would there be a difference if I inform them and they replace the meter? Or their computer system finds out that the meter is faulty? Can they charge a penalty for their faulty meter? If yes, for how many months?
