Peixe bebe água também sim. Isso tem a ver com o fato de peixe de água doce morrer em água salgada e vice-versa, por que o equilíbrio de sais nesses organismos é adaptado ao meio ambiente e à ingest?o de água. Ao contrário do que foi citado, a respira??o do peixe n?o tem nada a ver com ingest?o de água, na respira??o a água passa através das gelras e volta ao meio ambiente, n?o há ingest?o.|`|Db8HOC0maa	Oi, Beb !<br>  <br>  Nada (ahahahahaha !) !<br>  <br>  Abs.|`|b630c0cb18c593626ee575f89be4f1c4aa	Dorme.<br>  <br>  Acertei primeiro. 10 pontos.|`|ovO8gpwRaa	ESSE PEIXE MORREU AFOGADO|`|1nkg78Miaa	NADA...! hihihi...ele...nada! rsrsrsr....muito boa essa!!<br>  <br>  <br>  kuando tem sede abre a boca i engole... huahahauahahau|`|HlrpopbBaa	chora....<br>  mas suas lágrimas se perdem no oceano....<br>  rsrsrsrsrsrs<br>  <br>  é cada uma que me aparece, por isso eu amo o YR !!!|`|OvIirj2Aaa	Volta pra dentro do mar, do lago, da piscina, sei lá de onde ele saiu|`|QKsoRQuMaa	eles se acasala o peixe come ovulos e as peixas comen espermas|`|UyhpKYeTaa	Liga pro MCdonalds e pede uma Coca-Cola!!!<br>  heehuehuehueheuheu, muito boa essa!!!|`|e727c8dd95c8a46e95205e5eaef216f5aa	Vai ao boteco e toma meiota.|`|uc0sLwWxaa	Come alguma coisa...rsrsrsrsrsrsrs|`|003ccfbeaecdddfd46aa255e4c0e7424aa	que tal beber oxigênio.|`|7ps7SYyeaa	Nada|`|F5cxBlmraa	ele ve uma pexa... ai ele fica com agua na boca pra comer ela (comer: vc pode uzar o sentido que preferir) ai ele mata a sede com a agua na boca! <br>  <br>  =D|`|Hf7u1TEGaa	fecha a boca.. uhuhauha|`|hXcqohccaa	VC sente vontade de respirar de vez em quando???<br>  <br>  Ent?o? os peixes est?o para a água assim como nós estamos para o ar.<br>  <br>  Peixes n?o sentem sêde pq resipiram água.
zVHIluGyaa	N?o, n?o é verdade. <br>  Essa água é + pura do que aquela que tiras da torneira pois é desmineralizada, o que n?o quer dizer que seja melhor para beber. Mas está descan?ada que n?o te fará mal|`|eF5DzusLaa	VENENOSA??? é agua suja.<br>  <br>  O motor do ar-condicionado é que nem da geladeira.  O gelo da geladeira é venenoso???|`|bb8fd004d586212774b7c8f0810de347aa	Claro que n?o, amigo. A água que sai do ar condicionado é água destilada, produzida pelo contato da água que se encontra no ar em estado de vapor com a superfície gelada do compressor do ar condicionado. é claro que ela sai cheia de impurezas do próprio ar condicionado, mas daí a dizer que é venenosa, há uma grande diferen?a. Boa sorte.|`|TQGYk0Weaa	NADA SE FOSSE TODOS Já TERIA MORRIDO.|`|5f413a06bdb884773821fce7761c1441aa	SIM E VERDADE|`|D5MSrWVvaa	N?o. A água que pinga do ar condicionado é causada pela condensa??o em torno da tubula??o de resfriamento do ar.<br>  é a mesma coisa na geladeira. Aquela tubula??o de cobre por onde corre o gás que resfria, faz condensar a umidade do ar em torno do cano. Quando a temperatura é muito baixa esta umidade se torna gelo, sen?o, como no ar-condicionado, fica pingando.<br>  Ou seja, é agua vinda do próprio ar que respiramos, ent?o n?o é venenosa.|`|gHvLa2Thaa	venenosa n?o, mais impropria para o consumo|`|kxLRgMmtaa	claro q n?o!!!!
75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	yes and no.<br>  when there is sprawl, then someone has to pay for police, fire, schools, etc. <br>  bedroom communities typically find it hard to do that.<br>  on the other hand, if they don't incorporate, then it's the county that has the responsibility. <br>  more taxes are collected for a house than farmland. <br>  but more services are also required. |`|AA11980483	Yes, <br>  Cities annex land and increase property value assessments<br>  in an effort to increase taxes & bring in more money for<br>  city spending without actually having to ask the taxpayers<br>  to vote on higher taxes. Which of course the taxpayers would<br>  vote down...
KfCJDp0Laa	i sort of get what you mean but i think the energy penalty would be prohibitive. also, there are several nasties in coal, mercury and sulphur in particular, which might make the char unsuitable for agricultural use. its certainly not advised to use coal ash on the garden in the way we use wood ash.|`|9R0wRAxbaa	If you produce carbon back from CO2 it could be used again to feed the power-station and you would have a "motu perpetuo" what obviously is impossible.<br>  <br>  The reality is that doing so the energetic balance of the power station would be negative.

NjIuPz4waa	Catch them without hurting them, you can get sticky traps and their feet get stuck on them and then you can let them go. or build a ramp up to a jar / bucket with some food in and they fall in and cant get back out...<br>  Theres probably quite a few ways to catch them without hurting / killing them!|`|pAgzk7MKaa	by taping up the whole, the mouse will probably just die of starvation and then rot in the wall.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd rather die in an instant of my neck being broken, then to be trapped in a room, and die of dehydration.|`|aGM9keDEaa	Get a cat, and all your problems with the mice will be gone.|`|rnQ5LD2haa	no save the mouse with a cage trap please don't hurt him/her! :)|`|wMkX5foPaa	if that would cause sickness or trouble to you then kill it if not dont|`|5RWpno3Taa	Mouse or person. Just kill the animal!|`|R1E7Bn0raa	Think about this. If you feed the mouse he will bring all his brothers in for the feist and in a short time you will have 25 in your room looking for food. yes, they breed very quickly. Plugging the hole will not cure the problem. They will make another somewhere else. They are also cannibals and will eat each other. Extermination is the best way,there are other ways besides the trap,decon etc. As cute and fuzzy as they seem, they are not.
d7c510c65962a00dc9f574a023db035aaa	Yes <br>  All DNA on earth will come out with some similarity's. May not be just a like but will be close.|`|AA11462299	Absolutely, evolution is a continous process and there will always be new microorganism forming as well as dissolving. In the animal world this is evidenced by the appearance of new viruses and bacteria for example AIDS. In the plant world it is much more apparent due to the overwhelming amont of organism present and the the presence of factors that affect such an outcome.
sSvPEf97aa	"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." [H. L. Mencken] <br>  <br>  Sounds a lot like "Global Warming" doesn't it?<br>  <br>  "Global Warming" is a lot like the Y2K fear, except there is no end date.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	YES - just like global cooling was in the 1970s.|`|12984593ea7093cf70b5e4ea31b4bb24aa	People will only be afraid if they want to be afraid of something.   I paid no attention to the "terrorist threat" since I know I'm in much more danger walking across a street than I am in being attacked by terrorists.    I believe we are screwing up the delicate balance in the atmosphere, but it isn't something that is going to kill us all.   Life will just be a little more difficult and a bunch of species will disappear.   Humans have only been on the planet a million years or so.   It did perfectly well before we came along, and will continue to do perfectly well after we're gone.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	You are correct.  They are using a natural phenomenon to scare people.  Also, it has been proven that the air leaving the United States is cleaner then the air coming from Asia so how will having the US clean up their air more help when the air just keeps on getting dirtier in Asia?|`|12035198c8e9d24c6206ed225138c87caa	Yeah. Can be a chilled out one, if everyone is concern about what happened in their surrounding.
ZcJgYpE6aa	I'll probably get a lot of abuse,but I go along with the"Media Pressure" theory. While I'm willing to take unwanted clothing and books to the local charity chop (as I often do ) I'm not happy to walk/drive miles to take bottles/newspapers/tins/batteries to some improbable collection bank. I have no idea what happens to that,nor,to be honest am I that interested. If there was a collection on my doorstep,i would be happy to comply. But why should we spend time and energy doing it ourselves?|`|pnCOR1UVaa	I can't imagine any reason why we don't all do it. It makes no sense at all to bury resources in the ground. I also don't know why people feel compelled to spread misinformation about it causing more pollution and costing more etc.|`|5TKEtXERaa	It is the LEAST important of the 3 R's, having said that it is still very important but pales in comparison to Reduce and Reuse if either of these got the hype recycling gets we would be making dramatic gains for the environment. <br>  <br>    Having said that here are some great sites for recycling:|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	In some ways I agree, in others I don't.  For instance, the council have us sorting rubbish into all sorts of bins and boxes, then they collect them and tip everything into one (when they can be bothered to collect).  I have spoken to my council 3 times about this but nothing has been done.   Also, we have to separate our cans, paper and plastics and put them into one bin so I need the carrier bags to use to separate them.   If I don't have the carrier bags I have to go and buy plastic bin liners to separate the items which is defeating the object. As far as carrier bags are concerned - why can't the shops go back to paper bags like they used to do?  Bottles - I have to take to the nearest bottle bank some 5 miles away so that means I have to polute the air by using my car to get there.   The streets are littered with rubbish and people throw stuff everywhere and fly-tip in the countryside.  Clothes etc I'm happy to recycle by sending to charity.  The UK has gone all out crazy on recycling and the environment but what good is our little island going to make when huge countries like China just do as they like puffing unbelievable amounts of toxic fumes into the atmosphere so that we can buy things cheaper here whilst our manufacturing industries have to comply with stringent regulations and more often closing down because they can't afford to compete?|`|olMVfnljaa	I feel really strongly about it. I think some people are being really selfish, if they lived 600 years later, they wouldn't want to live in a horrible, stinking, landfill site, with pollution and disease, would they? If we don't recycle, where is it all going?<br>  Imagine this:<br>  An average glass bottle takes approx. one million years to decay. -Recycle. Use it again, and we won't have to dump it in the ground and wait for it to ruin our world. <br>  A tin can (fizzy drinks can) takes 500 years to decay. That's ridiculous when you can melt it down and use it for countless numbers of things.<br>  <br>  Don't you agree?|`|n7uoE9wmaa	I do as much as possible.  I would urge people to consider freecycling too, it is a scheme which works on the basis that what is rubbish to one person is useful to another.  Basically giving stuff away.  Check the website; I use this a lot|`|CCLLnSrGaa	ive started doing now,it was a pain at first.only thing is i dont know about recycling rabbit bedding|`|SxI6y9GWaa	I feel very strongly about it.  During WW2 because of shortages of just about everything, people had to do a lot of recycling so I was brought up with the ethic to hoard string, re-use Xmas paper and waste nothing.  In the long run it saves you money.  If you can barter things you don't want for things you do want which other people are willing to barter, that's all to the good too.  By just recycling your own waste - either by composting paper, veg peelings, eggshells, used tea bags etc into a compost heap and using the result on your garden, you save having to buy mass-produced composts.  By giving cardboard, plastic bags, cans & bottles etc to the local recycling system, you find you end up with very little waste yourself and you help the environment in the long run.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Like anything, if there is not a market for the recycled goods, then what good is it.  Currently with the world economy going down the toilet, most recycling companies cannot get rid of what they have so prices drop and less recycling actually takes place.  As the World economy starts to recover, these markets will return.  I for one with my girlfriend recycle and let the city take care of finding a buyer.|`|eV8kcAHaaa	Recycling becomes a good way of life for those who are not too busy.  It is what people have done throughout history.  There is a saying "waste not want not".  It was only recently that wealthy people in developed countries thought they could live without recycling.  What we throw away is naturally recycled, but plastics take far too long to rot so we should not be leaving nature to recycle them.  The more we have the more we need to recycle.  Our shops are full of stuff that needs to be recycled soon after it is bought.|`|8Wbf4BpCaa	Well last night I discovered that my Great Grandfather was a war hero. Im so proud that his generation and their sons thought it was worth fighting to give us a life today. They witnessed things I never have and hope I never will and risked their lives.<br>  All our governments are asking us today is to separate our rubbish and re use materials in order to give our future Children and Grandchildren a life.<br>  In comparison to my Grandfather and Great Grandfathers generation, we are been asked so little and think we all have a responsibility for the future of mankind.<br>  I am aware from news programmes on the Television that some councils have taken recycled rubbish and shipped it to India to be buried. I think they should hang their heads in shame. However, I also think it would be unfair to judge all councils or local authority by those values.|`|QIwhMrBraa	i think in this country its gone way over the top. a neighbour who works for the council actually tried to bully me over recyling last year, noticed i handt been putting out my boxes. i told him i never got any, which is true. but i also thought to myself, f**k off, not ur business mate. did he ever get me boxes? nah. guess it werent that important to him were it.<br>  <br>  enough people recycle and there is too much rubbish now that even the recyling companies cannot handle it. ive read news stories saying its deluded to think ur recyling is being recycled much of the time it isnt. and trust the people who are religious about recyling probably do other things that arent so perfect for the world.<br>  <br>  people just use this as another excuse to bully other people. what if i went up to a fat person and bullied them on the basis they take up too much space and waste NHS resources that could be far better used (eg to treat patients who suffer from no fault of their own).<br>  <br>  just a thought.|`|TJ6hKDAiaa	im all for it and emmissions and using alternatives for power. anything that preserves earth, being that im a virgo and earth is my element|`|YBoShTIOaa	I think it should be done and it's a great way of doing less damage to the environment and wasting less. I just wish everyone could buy as many recycled things as they can!|`|0b04c7a0c2d6347def6134f6598d75d4aa	Not so bad if I knew exactly what happened to the stuff I recycled. Nobody ever thinks to tell. I hope it is worth my while.|`|FOgyHNM5aa	There is no excuse for doing no recycling, if you are in the UK all you have to do is put the stuff in a black box and put it outside every other week, even the box is given for free. I enjoy recycling, its not really about saving energy because it does not. I always joke 'the energy you save recycling you use in water washing out the cans'. It's 100% true. But its about using things again and again so they don't need to be dumped into a landfill and more trees are not chopped down than necessary. Governments also do need to make it easier to recycle a whole load more materials, manufacturers need to work along side this too by using recycled materials or using materials that can be recycled.  I hope that gave you a little insight into my view on the whole recycling thing.|`|zMz7yVksaa	I agree with it. Firstly, if we was all taxed slightly when we buy any product, this money could be used to refund anybody that recycles their rubbish.<br>   If I was able to take lets say all my cardboard to a waste recycling centre and they refunded me per kilo of cardboard.<br>  Another positive way forward is for more supermarkets to have a system where you could take your reusable plastic tub from home and weigh your corflakes for instance and pay for them per kilo. There would be no wasted paskaging as you would clean your tub and use it again for next weeks shop.|`|P6o2mc8haa	I feel like the government is cowardly and should be investing millions more into recycling. I mean for instance, they say they can only recycle 2 different types of plastic, but that is rubbiosh as I know that all 25 types can be recycled. I love it in Holland and Germany where they have 4 bins everywhere you go, one for paper, plastic, glass and metal. Is very cool!|`|da59b44452c599e7a03e6a7a72f23754aa	I'm supposed to sort all my rubbish so that the council can go and dump it in a landfill site somewhere in India.<br>  I'm supposed to take all glass down to the bottle bank – even though I don't drive.<br>  They tell me to recycle all paper and card. They tell me to shred all documents to avoid identity theft from the wheely bins that I didn't ask them for. Then they tell me that they can't recycle shredded paper.  <br>  So the answer is that I'm really quite annoyed about it.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  There is nothing free here. The council charge yearly for the wheely bins, of which you need three if you have a garden.|`|BiZp6pDCaa	Making money from recycling seems to be a major incentive for people to practice environmental responsibility.  Recycled products not only result in less waste and enviromental damage it can help REDUCE your COUNCIL TAX BILLS.  Recycling is a PROFITABLE business and COUNCILS should be using it to save money and not tell us we need to pay more because we need to recycle.  Remember your now giving your council money and not rubbish.  Have you never heard the saying "One man's rubbish is another man's treasure"?|`|N1IQuM1jaa	it is important, and there are good reasons for doing it.  Its not just something councils dreamt up to make our lives more difficult!  Our natural resources like oil, which we rely on to make plastic are depleted fast, and once its gone, its gone.  We must therefore make an effort to turn old products into new ones to avoid overusing natural resources.  Reducing the amount of rubbish we produce in the first place is more important though...if the rubbish isnt there in the first place, we wont have to recycle it!  Also reusing things, instead of dumping them.  Regardless of whether or not you agree with recycling, it is in our interest to do it...if the UK does not meet its recycling targets, it will face massive fines from the EU...which not doubt will fall on the shoulders of the taxpayer!|`|BXOjLVkCaa	I completely agree with it. I think society wastes too much at the moment in our disposable society.<br>  I think we should recycle more for our descendants so that there will be enough resources for them.<br>  Also we live in a must have society which I am also as guilty of. For instance I own about 700+ DVDs. I rarely watch any of them. They take up unnecessary space in my house and the materials from which they are made could of been used for something else. If the majority of people are like myself then think just how much resources we are consuming that we don't really need.|`|8089f09c29368afeb07f9ba89595f610aa	I think it is something that we all SHOULD do! We all have a responsibility to look after our planet and quite frankly it doesn't take must effort!<br>  <br>  Anyone who feels it is a waste of time IS a waste of time!!!|`|c77b996327401a827d6f388748da1db8aa	I gave it up years ago.
