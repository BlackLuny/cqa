20090203104735AAxOqne	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Are Portuguese darker than Northern Europeans? If so, Why?	I was looking at a study of various European haplogroups and it seems to me that the Portuguese share much in common, genetically, with Northern Europeans such as Brits and the Dutch. Both have high frequencies of the R1b y chromosome haplogroups.    Yet, my impression has always been taht the Portuguese are significantly darker than Northern Europeans, and perhaps evend arker than Greeks or Italians.      So, how dark are the portuguese compared to other Europeans? How could one explain this in light of genetic similarities with Northern Europeans?

20090203104852AAdXUQO	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Girls' Lesbian hints...?	Just so you know, I'm a guy asking this question to put it in the right frame of mind. And I think I'm going to post it in the Singles forum and the Lesbians/Gay forum just to get a clearer perspective. Ah, it'll make sense once you read on.      Ah, a while back my friend introduced me to this really attractive girl, April at an outing of his, and before the outing he was telling me that he was attempting to get myself and this girl together.       But then during the outing 1. all she can talk about is her job and how she's being treated weirdly because she's a woman. 2. how she's pissed off that it is customary for a guy to ask a girl out and not the other way around. 3. talking about her idiot long distance boyfriend. 4. and finally to seal the coffin, talking about how she hung at some lesbian bar and really liked the atmosphere there.      I've had another girl, who I considered a prospect at the time, tell me she liked hanging at a certain lesbian bar as well.       I've been told by others that this is just a test to see if you really are into them, but inwardly I was thinking, especially with the April girl, I barely know you and you're dumping all this lesbian stuff on me? It didn't make sense. It was almost like more of a warning rather than a test, both these girls reaked of damaged goods! I mean think about it, that's something you would tell another person once you were in the relationship but not before. Or maybe you would tell them before. And then by the end of our little party she was all drunk and hugging up on me. Needless to say I was a bit confused, the hug was good, but everything else was crap.       But anyway, they were both hot, and both very intellectual, and that got me really wondering which idiot boyfriend of theirs was stupid off to mess up that deal?       I don't know. I heard a commedian one time say to the effect that if you find the most perfect girl, attractive, smart, just beautiful, welp odds are that she's got bigger balls than you do. And lately I'm starting to agree with that, hot girls, even just girls above a seven outa 10, around these here parts are fudged up. But why?      Oh and I was wondering if these girls actually are lesbians too? On a social website I saw one girl in her photos indeed hanging out at a lesbian bar. Looked like she was having a blast. But I mean, come on, if that's a test then it's the most effed up one in history. I mean, why test someone with parameters that shred your own morals if, in fact, what you say is not true? But then if it is true, but she was still trying to get with me, then is she Bi or something? And if I can remember, a few of my friends, years ago when they talked about their girlfriends, they would bring up how their girl was sorta into other girls too. But these all seemed like normal people, not the stereotypical combat boot lesbians you think of. But then if they're Bi that might change their appearance. Dahhh, I'm just confused!      Anyway, thoughts, opinions?

Doch der junge Dresdner h?ngt noch ein Jahr dran, bleibt weiterhin bei den 70 geistig und k?rperlich behinderten Kindern in der Bonnewitzer Heilp?dagogischen F?rderschule. Ich will noch mehr dazulernen, sagt er. Nach der Schule wollte ich Geographie studieren. Aber jetzt will ich Rehabilitations-Sportlehrer werden.

There are a lot of guys in my life (5 or 6) but I don't know who to trust, who to pursue, or who to ignore!         Guy #1..We'll call him G. Well G and I used to have a thing last semester (Mid Oct 08 to Mid Dec 08) I really liked before but he did not want commitment and basically wanted friends with benefits even though he did like me too. he said it was because he's leaving in june to go back to his country but I think that's only part of it. well over the past month and a half I stopped talking to him because I figured it was time to move on. BUT A few days ago he called me and asked to hang out (we both live in the dorms) and we did. He finally decided to take some initiative with me and I like that. Slender/fit He has a hot athletic body and a hot face. he's tall and dark brown. .         guy #2. we'll call him C. he's new to the college and dorms. I am starting to like. I know he finds me attractive and he knows i'm interested. but I don't know if he prefers me or another girl A in the dorms as well..because they are both the same country (in south america) and she is beautiful. i don't know what i should do..like pursue him, or stay back up and let him make moves at the risk of the other girl taking him...I'm not even sure if he likes me like that. hot face, good body, he's tan skinned. Has boxbraids, is shorter than me. has a nice style/fashion. V            guy #3 he'll be N. i thought he was cute, so i told a mutual friend this. So she gave him my number and he called. Now I don't know if I should pursue it. I don't know him but he seems nice. I was supposed to call him yesterday to set up plans but i never did. He's attractive. has a mature style, and has a normal/okay body      Guy #4 is J. He calls me ALL the time at every time imaginable, but something about him turns me off. The way he talks. I heard some negative things about him but he claims he turned his life around. Something about him is a little off??? i don't know.

Is it the grief of leaving someone or those you love behind? Is it the fact if they are (not) saved you may not see them again.       Is it leaving behind all that is dear to you like people you love or pets or things you did not get to accomplish.?      Is it the grief of leaving those behind?      Yet the Christian looks forward to heaven when we do die.      I am a bible beleiveing Spirit filled Christian

I cant seem to find it in my bible. & on the internet, i've found different versions. Whats the true one?Btw, I want the King James version   These are two of a few different versions i've found:   Love is patient, love is kind.   It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.   It is not rude, it is not self-seeking.   It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.   Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.   It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.   Love never fails.   2:   Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous, love is never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offense, and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people‚Äôs sins but delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes. Love does not come to an end.‚Äù      There are so many others that i found too!

20090222203249AACBqJi	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Worried that someone may try to hurt me....... advice please?	For the past year, i've been sort of talking to this guy i met online. He's a celebrity...a famous musician. He really seemed to like me and i liked him a lot at first too. B/c i like his music and from interviews and stuff, he seemed really cool and compatible with me. So i started sending him messages and stuff on a website and he never replied to the messages. Then i started sending him videos of myself and we started to sort of communicate through that. It's been like 5 months of this though and this guy still refuses to reply to me. He has yet to make any real verbal communication with me. I knew that waiting this long for him to talk to me would be a real challenge for me and probably something impossible for me altogether. I just needed to know where he stands and what exactly is going on in his mind. I started getting paranoid and freaking out about stuff that i've never had to worry about. I started worrying that he has somehow bugged my computer and can see everything i do. I have good reason to have thoughts like this b/c i know he has access to a lot of technology that most of us have never even heard of.       Back when i was making videos for him, my computer started acting up as a result. And he didn't lift a finger to help me. Infact, he was acting like he didn't wanna communicate w/ me at all anymore. B/c of things like this, i started worrying that he could also try infecting my computer with a virus. I'm really poor...and he knows i don't have a lot of money for security. If something was to happen to my computer or to me, I wouldn't have the money to get out of it. And please don't go thinking that i wanted him for his money or whatever b/c i don't. I'm not a gold digger and i always made that clear. The funny thing is that i feel like HE was the one making a big issue about his fame and supposed riches. He's the one making me feel like i need to hang on to him b/c i've got no money. But i've decided to drop him. I've tried to do this months ago.. when i saw that he wasn't communicating with me normally, it freaked me out. It makes me think that there's something else going on that i don't know about. Everytime i try to drop him, i've gone back and it's always back to the same mess... sometimes even worse b/c he is now angry that i tried to get away.       This time, i've decided not to go back under any circumstances but i'm so worried about all types of stuff. I don't feel like he's my friend... i feel like he's my enemy and could try to hurt me somehow. Has anyone ever felt like this?! And what do i do?

O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.        7 How priceless is your unfailing love!           Both high and low among men           find [b] refuge in the shadow of your wings.        8 They feast on the abundance of your house;           you give them drink from your river of delights.        9 For with you is the fountain of life;           in your light we see light.        10 Continue your love to those who know you,           your righteousness to the upright in heart.        11 May the foot of the proud not come against me,           nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.        12 See how the evildoers lie fallen‚Äî           thrown down, not able to rise!

Any thoughts?	**** I'VE POSTED A SIMILAR QUESTION BEFORE . IN THIS QUESTION, I HAVE SEVERAL FOCUS ABOUT MY FUTURE CAREER.       THANKS FOR SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TO READ MY QUESTION. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE **********      I am 23, male. I have been studied science in an Australian university for 1 year. My parents want me to be a biological scientist but I am not interested in science at all. I didn't do well and finaIly I droped out from the course :( . My university counsellor suggest me to go back to Hong Kong (my hometown) and discover my own interest before I go back to study in Australia. Back in Hong Kong, I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.However, she doen't pay anything.      Recently all my family members suspect I am gay. They ask , " I'm sure that you drop out from your science course because you are homosexual. Ewww! Everyday they say unplesant things to me ( e.g. I hate you so much, I'll never forgive you, You should turn back to heterosexual, I wanna beat you up because you are gay, All gay men are worse than sh*t, including you ) I face their bad words everyday in addition to having an academic failure, I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?You know what? I have been tolerated your gayness for a while!" My parents are always on her side. They say" Listen to *your sister, you f*ggot" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you loosen up yourself and date women?   " I replied "I have tried to date a girl for 3 months. But finally I've found that it doesn't work. I don't want to cheat the girl and say "I am straight" anymore. I don't want to hurt the girl. We broke up. " I added " I am proud of being gay". My sister replied , " You're so defensive about your homosexuality therefore no counsellor on Earth can help you. "       I also said , " I dropped out from science course because I have no interest in it at all. Mum, My dream is to be an successful accountant, not a scientist ."      Question 1) Which one do you think is better? Get my accounting degree in Australia or worjk in Hong Kong ? You are 23 year old laready. My mum said " If you study full-time in Australia for 3 more years , it mean you will lose 3 years of work experience. When you graduate with an accounting degree at the age of 26, no one will hire you again because you are too old at that time. And you don't have much full-time job experience . You will not able to find a good job because employers tend to employ younger people. However, I really wanna go to Australia , do my favourite course and stay away my parents.

20090222204157AAxtbHp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah's Witnesses please...could another angel have accomplished what Jesus did?	Today's WT study prompted a conversation.  An angel being born of woman in the line of David etc....would have been a corresponding ransom for what Adam lost (perfect human), still could have been a seed of the woman (God's organization), however, with Jehovah's only begotten son also being "the word" or spokesman, it made him the BEST one to relay Jehovah's purpose to mankind.        We know Jesus' character and humility means he would not delegate this opportunity to make his father's name known to mankind whom he loved, but COULD he have done so and from our perspective everything would be the same?      I figured I'd put this question to my brothers and sisters worldwide on YA before beginning my own research :)  please include references.  Thank you.

Had  a virgin birth, Baptized in a river By Arup who was later beheaded, was tempted while alone in the desert, he healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, casted out Demons, walked on water, Raised a man from the dead (Asar) (Asar translates to Lazerus), was crucified, arose after three days and met by two women, OH and he had twelve disciples..

20090222201151AAQNWyO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you believe in Jesus and only traditional marriage, you should answer.?	Spiritually speaking, to those who supported Prop 8?   This guy Brian asked these questions, and I found them to be very perplexing. Please, answer these questions.      I've heard numerous times here when asking questions about homosexual rights that because the majority of the people voted it, it should be enforced.      Ok, now working under that assumption I have a few questions:      1. Do you believe that just because a lot of people believe something, it is right/moral?      For example, the majority of the US used to think it was ok to own slaves. Later, the majority of the US didn't think that African Americans (and women) should have the right to vote.      2. Do you believe that the government has the responsibility to protect the minority from the whims of the majority in this case? If not, do you think that it was good that the government stepped in in the past (i.e. ending slavery, segregation, the black vote, women's sufferage, etc)?      3. What makes this situation different from the civil rights issues mentioned in question 2? What secularly measurable ill effects does homosexuality have upon society that makes it different from other civil rights cases, and worthy of being banned?      and finally      4. A hypothetical situation. Let's say that we lived in a country where there was a muslim majority. Do you, as a Christian, think it would be right if the majority of people in the country voted that all women would have to wear a hijab?      Basically, if the majority was not christianity, would it be ok for whatever religion was in control to use their numbers to legislate their religion upon people who do not share their beliefs?

20090222202932AAf4Uke	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do people of different religions show unique patterns in describing "objective" near-death experiences?	My parents are fundamentalist Christians. As evidence for their beliefs, they say that they knew many Christians who started calling to their deceased relatives as they approached death, as if the relative was coming to guide them in to the afterlife. They also talk about the experiences of people who are "dead" for periods of time, and who claim to have been in heaven or spoken with angels while dead. I‚Äôm familiar with many attempts at scientific explanations for the ‚Äútunnel‚Äù phenomenon and out-of-body experiences, but I‚Äôm not aware of any specific tradition or reason, beyond happenstance, that this could be happening to a significant number of their religious friends.      It doesn‚Äôt seem implausible that people would call out to dead relatives in their final moments if they‚Äôre expecting to see them, but it still seems like a rather strange pattern. It also seems that, if some Christians have this tradition, other religions might have the same or similar traditions.      Does anyone know about the way different religions describe these near-death or "temporary death" experiences? Any similarities and differences between the experiences people of various religions talk about?

According to the idea, called the ekpyrotic universe theory, the universe was born not just once, but multiple times in endless cycles of fiery death and rebirth. Enormous sheet-like "branes," representing different parts of our universe, collide about once every trillion years, triggering Big Bang-like explosions that re-inject matter and energy into the universe.       claims that the ekpyrotic, or "cyclic," theory would explain not only inflation, but other cosmic mysteries as well, including dark matter, dark energy and why the universe appears to be expanding at an ever-accelerating clip

I often hear the famous phrase " Our Lord is perfect"      Christians ( I am also a believer) say God is perfect, but I failed to see how such a perfect God would make so many errors.

Many folks are born with 2 feet, yet can't use them to walk.   Born with eyes, yet can't see from them.  Wisdom teeth become troublesome and require to be taken out by dentists.  The spine curves so bad that it requires major surgery to get it fixed, which can also paralyzes the patient.   And many more errors.       I don't understand when Christians say God is perfect when I am seeing so many errors.   Could you please explain what is considered "Perfect" to you?       Thanks, and please be courteous.       Dad

Can someone with good Spanish grammar skills translate the following for me to help me. I truly, greatly appreciate it and owe you my life if you do. MUCHOS GRACIAS:)   and PLEASE DONT USE ANY TRANSLATION WEBSITES... they don't work very well. plez      PLEASE TRANSLATE THE FOLLOWING:      For several decades drugs have been one of the major problems of society. There have been escalating costs spent on the war against drugs and countless dollars spent on rehabilitation, but the problem still exists. Not only has the drug problem increased but drug related problems are on the rise. Drug abuse is a killer in our country. Some are born addicts, while others become users.      Many believe that legalizing drugs would lessen crime. They point out that the legalization of drugs would deter future criminal acts. They also emphasize and contrast Prohibition. When the public realized that Prohibition could not be enforced the law was repealed. From this, one may infer the same of legalizing drugs. Legalizing alcohol didn't increase alcoholism, so why would drugs increase drug abuse?              However, drugs should not be legalized because there would be an increase in drug abuse due to its availability. Once legalized, drugs would become cheaper and more accessible to people who previously had not tried drugs, because of the high price or the legal risk. Drug abuse would skyrocket! Addicts who tend to stop, not by choice, but because the drugs aren't accessible would now feed the addiction if drugs were made legal.      Although people feel that legalizing drugs would lessen crime, drugs should remain illegal in the U.S because there would be an increase of drug abuse and a rapid increase of diseases such as AIDS. The United States can not afford this problem. It has become a world power by strengthening its people not by killing them. Drug abuse has gotten worse, with its effects on crack babies, drug addicts, and the I.V user. There must be education for the survival of this nation, not legalization.

20090222214141AAEO6yU	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How long does it take to find a place to live?	Okay, everyone knows the economy is in terrible shape right now but.....I have a "squatter" staying at my place right now. It's been FIVE weeks now and she still hasn't found a place to live.      Before you say I'm mean for wanting to get her out, first let me explain about her situation. I did NOT ask her to stay here, she is one of my roommate's sister. Did I forget to mention that the squatter DOES have a job? Yes a job, she got hired in San Francisco, but has been staying with us until she finds her own place.      First, my roommate told me that his sister was only going to stay only 1 week and that she has the money for a deposit/rent to find a new place.      Second, she was also willing to help pay for house supplies and utilities (utilities she pays to the landlady directly); totally fine with me (cause she's a very wasteful person).      So my question is, how long is too long?      Do you think the reason she hasn't found a place yet is because all of the places she's looked at they didn't like her? Or is she just too picky?      At my place, I told my roommate that I didn't want her to be a new roommate (because she is not mindful and not aware of her actions/surroundings in regards to others). I picked someone else over her (and I love my new roommate, so I'm glad I did not choose his squatter sister).      I also don't consider his sister as a "guest">>>a guest doesn't stay for an extended period of time and she knows all of the rules/expectations of the place she is currently staying temporarily...but she NEVER complies with them unless me or the other roommate tells her otherwise (like pulling her fair share of throwing out trash if it looks full, not using other peoples' stuff, and not wearing outdoor shoes in the apartment all of the time, plus not to occupy one of the bathrooms especially since she knows me and the other roommate needs it during certain hours of the day for work/school).      She is driving me and the other roommate crazy! It is NOT OUR JOB to constantly remind her or babysit her stupid actions!      At the same time I'm also angry with her brother (even though he's a great housemate and I've never argued with him ever) for constantly trying to "fix" his stupid sister's mistakes or justify her actions>>>>>>sooner or later EVERYONE needs to grow up!      Plus, I don't "care" about the whole damn excuse that she's a cancer survivor (heck I've survived death too and I was in a two week coma, but I don't use past health issues to cripple me and what needs to be done).         Every-time I ask her about current updates about places, she's always saying stuff about places having too many "rules" to abide by, location being too far from work, etc...I asked her if she thought about "expanding" more options, like living at near by towns...she commented that she wanted to be closer to work (excuses, excuses.....), it's not like she doesn't have a CAR! Which she DOES! From my experience with her, I don't buy her story that "she's always looking really hard" to find a place. She works Monday-Friday and on weekends she wakes up at 12 noon (and stays home most of the time).      San Francisco is very expensive to live, but it's not like she doesn't have the money, plus rent is cheaper now. She's not even looking to "rent" on her own, but is looking for a place with housemates to share. I remember that back in 06' when I was looking for an apartment to share with roommates, it took me less than a month (2 1/2 weeks the most) to find a place, a good place & good location. At the time I was working Full time & going to school Full time as well (his sister only works but doesn't have work on weekends or school). Plus, with my new housemate who just moved in in this January, she told me it took her 2 weeks to look around until she found me & she works 40+hours a week, including weekends!      So what the hell is the real reason why my other roommate's sister is not finding her own damn place by now? What can I do about her?      She's been here for 5+weeks now.      Please help with suggestions.

We'd like to reward you for your faithful service on Earth. Is there anything we can do for you?" The Pope says, "Well," he says, "you know, I've never seen the original form of the Bible." Saint Peter says, "Okay, fine." He ushers him into a little room. There on the table is the original version of the Bible, and he leaves him alone in there to browse through it. After a few minutes, he hears the Pope exclaim. "Oh," he says, "Oh, my goodness," he says. "The word is *celebrate*!"      -Alan Dundes from The God Who Wasn't There

I can do that my own way on my own time and not have to go through the motions because it's expected. I don't want one for myself, and don't want to attend anyone else's funeral. I am worried that when one of my family member dies I will be expected to attend.      Is there a way to tell my family I don't want to go? How would you feel if your own family member refused to attend a loved one's funeral?

But here is the strange thing about me: I don't get boners to girls/straight/lesbian porn (even if I think she/they are hot), but I do get them to guys, even if they are not in porn. i even have sex with my guy cousin (who is the same exact as me, and yes, I know this is nasty). I'm so messed up, I truly need help. I never want to tell my parents about this, and I am afraid to go to confession or tell a therapist (i am afraid that the priest or therapist will tell my parents). I need major help! Please help me!

So many people seem to allude to something wise and transcendent to the ways of the Buddha, yet they really only dabble in Buddhism.  Even atheists will call themselves Buddhists, ignoring the Buddha's own discussions about the reincarnation of the soul (the afterlife), nirvana, and even his references to various deities.  So many people nowadays seem to think that Buddhism is like a salad bar - take what you want, and leave the rest.  It's a hippie meets philosopher meets limousine liberal meets the Jedi sort of mentality.

I've seen several claims made here  that seem to be picked up and distributed by sincere Xtians who haven't done even basic research to see if they are true. Recently, these include:      *That Canada has banned portions of the Bible and imprisoned people for publicly preaching them.      " That Catholic Hospitals will be forced to either provide abortions or close if the Freedom of Choice Act is passed      " That if Prop 8 was not passed, Churches would be forced by the government to perform same-sex marriages, even if it contradicts their doctrines.      And numerous others.      5 minutes on Google would have shown all of the above to be blatant lies, but people don't seem to take those 5 minutes before passing on a falsehood that a) makes their faith look bad, and b) can have serious repercussions for society as a whole.

20090222222005AAICDtI	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	People smell nice??!?	Ok well lately I've noticed people smell really nice. I'm not talking about artificial smells like perfume, cologne or deodorant, I'm talking about their natural smell. It's so weird, are people even supposed to smell? (Apart from sweaty smell) Everyone used to just smell odourless to me. (Except for artificial odours and sweaty people)    Sometimes I want to just go and smell certain people because it's so lovely. (I don't of course...people would think I'm a freak (which I most likely am)) Because some smell even nicer than others. My best friend, for example, smells fantastic.    Peoples' breath is also nice. (natural breath, not mint or anything) Which comes as a shock to me -- I've always thought smelling other people's breath is absolutely repulsive. It even smells nice if it seems they haven't brushed their teeth that morning.      Why do people smell so wonderful suddenly??       Serious answers please!

20090222221953AAVU9bI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I'm losing my faith in God?	I think my faith has reached its tipping point. I go to church twice a week.

The girl who sleeps with every one, the party girl, the guy who's there just to get some, the wealthy guy my age who always says life is great and God is doing miracles in his life (no, your parents just were able to pay your way through college and you have a killer job),  the list goes on. I am tired of this. Why does it seem like the closer I try to get to God the more of this I see? I already lost my job and have a poor social life. I volunteered to work at church and was rejected. It seems like every church is not about what you know or where your heart is but who you know. I realize I am not perfect either but I am trying to change.  Others dont seem to want too. Why is this?
20070525094846AAA5D3c	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does God make Canadian borders bigger?	I just read this answer: "All atheists should move to Canada, it's right across the border anyway".      I don't know much about geography, but as a Dutch atheist, currently living in Romania this struck me as kinda odd. I always assumed Hungary was right across the border, but I might be wrong.      Or should I assume that God makes people believe that all atheists live in the USA? You know, 1 billion atheists living in a country of 300 million people.      Can the Canadian immigration laws handle 1 billion atheists entering the country?      Ok, ok, I'll stop ranting now. It just seems so silly to have to remind people on a World Wide Web that the world has more than one continent.

As people continue to eat healthier (more naturally), time spent on shopping for and preparing food has gone considerably up.  Frequently, people are keeping less in their refrigerators and spending the extra hour to fix a home-cooked meal from all natural ingredients.

What effect do you think this current economic downturn will have on this phenomenon?

He loves me to death. We have this great thing going. We have waited so long patiently to do what we're doing b/c my parents have been married for almost 30 years (unhappily) and have been together since age 20, and his have all been divorced multiple times.      After 6 months of our relationship, I broke up with him b/c I thought I wanted more out of my first love and could find that elsewhere. I dated another guy for 6 months, then broke up with him, and got back with the other. Realizing after all that time together each man/vs eachother, how much I really did love guy #1. So he took me back and we have taken it slow. Been living together for years, and it is great.      Dont tell me about the whole "milkin the cow ordeal" because we dont have sex. For "whatever" reasons, ill just leave it at that. It is pure love, but after all this time and no ring? PUHLEEZE...! We have talked about it...etc etc...it just hasnt happened. He's a smart guy, laid back, and doesnt like to rush things. He has great common sense, and I would trust him with any situation. He is my life saver. But at this point. I just feel stupid living together, (its our place together) and I am considering staying with my parents for at least a few days (or until I cant stand them any longer).      SLIGHT PROBLEM: is that I know his money has been tied up, and will be getting paid in full this year. I am just SO IMPATIENT! It kiiiiiiiiills me...Im just really sad...I told him I wanted him to propose to me in December (back in july 2008), then I said no dont do it because I will know that "it" is coming...and there will be no surprise. But at this point I am just burnt out...please help... me...*frawns*

We live together and we r trying 2 work it or even b friends. (we're gay) She said she needed space, her definition of space is that we go do things contact each other and hang out. Mine is let's not talk 4 a while. Feelins are there... but she is so mad @ me.  She wanted me 2 come out.. didn't b/c of work, but after broke up, i did and she can't get over it.  Dunno what to do.  I want 2 stay away n its hard... but we will see.  What should I do.. says she needs a while 2 get over n is far from it.  Should I keep in contact like she wants or should I stay away.  Its really hard 4 me cuz everytime we see each other we bring up us.. and it sucks to hear that she is not ready, its easier 4 me not 2 c her.  But if i don't contact her, then I feel she will be upset, what to do?

20090203124639AAlbMnU	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think it would be cool to see more relationships portrayed on screen with Asian men and black ladies?	In E.R. there were two relationships of such type between Dr. Pratt and Dr. Chen which ended with a split, then the more successful relationship between Gallant and Neesa which resulted in engagement and marriage, but was sadly short lived due to the producers killing off Gallant in a trip to care for refugees and wounded soldiers in Iraq. To me that was a stupid move because I think their relationship was successful and could have really transcended the series in a way especially if one of them ended up in the hospital and the other had to be the caretaker. Sort of like what happened when Dr. Benton's nephew died on the operating table after being shot and later when he quit at County General to care for his deaf son. That was some tragic, deep stuff that went down that I think the audience could relate to. Anyway I never seen any relationships portrayed between Asian men and African-American women on screen yet and I think that would be awesome! I suspect maybe the portrayal of the relationships between the Asian ladies and African-American men on screen might be partly portrayed more common for the lust aspect far more than for the committment emotional support aspect in popular media which is kind of sad because human communication between opposite genders is so much more than just satisfying sexual passion. So it gives a skewed impression. I also heard and read online that Asian men are often suspected of being reluctant to enter romantic relationships with African-American women because they are afraid of the criticism and constant complaining that might arise or something like that. That doesn't mean nothing to me though. I just think it would be cool to see that kind of relationship in film. In my novel I am writing called Grape Street the main character is a Korean boy whose parents are immigrant Americans and after they are murdered during the 1992 riots the Korean boy must adjust his fearful ideas about blacks (since he saw two blacks rush in, loot, and kill his mother and father at gunpoint) when a loving family of African-Americans adopt him from the orphanage and he must come to grips with coexisting with their son and then with romantic feelings he has for a black girl whom lives across the street from them in their South L.A. neighborhood.

20090203124827AAKicXE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Isn't the term "pro-life" an inaccurate title for the position?	To me, the term pro-life would indicate that this side is for life while the other side is for death.      The term pro-choice seems more relative to its position. People who are pro-choice support choice verses having that freedom of choice taken away.      In a literal sense, I would think that a person could be both pro-life and pro-choice at the same time. I believe that the right answer is to not have an abortion. I also believe that the person in question should make this choice herself. Though she should choose what I think is right, she should still be able to make the choice that I think is wrong. I am still supporting life but without intruding upon her freedom to make that choice.      I guess the terms anti-choice or pro-fascism sound too negative even though they both describe the opposition to pro-choice. It seems to me like the term pro-life is used because it sounds positive and makes the opposite "pro-death" seem quite negative.      What are your thoughts?

20090203123909AAMJ4Xv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of my opinion that abortion shouldn‚Äôt be a matter of public debate?	It‚Äôs something that should just go on behind closed doors. It‚Äôs one of those necessary evils (for want of better word) that society needs to have in order to avoid a worse evil. Society is not going to regress and outlaw abortion; all anti-abortion proponents are going to achieve with their emotional manipulations and religious gibberish is to increase the level of negative feelings in society. You know, I‚Äôm talking about feelings like guilt, shame, remorse, fear etc, these are the type of emotions that abortion triggers in people; anti-abortionists are just increasing the guilt, shame, remorse and fear in society and achieving nothing in return, except a feeling of smugness and false-piety in the rotten heart of the anti-abortionist.

A mi no me importa, pero me da la sensacion que todas las religiones tienen algo en contra de la mujer provocativa, especialmente el Islam y es curioso que el tema de la lujuria siempre se enfoque a la figura de la mujer, ?Es que los hombres no tenemos erotismo? ?Los hombres no son deseados?      Es bastante indignante ver opiniones tan estupidas como que el uso de las minifaldas o el erotismo es culpable de las violaciones. Tanto una mujer como un hombre, tienen perfecto derecho a incluso interrumpir un coito, porque les duela la cabeza, se aburran, o el motivo que sea, y el compa?er@ de cama no tiene otra que aguantarse.

I am one of the lucky few who no longer need anyones help but I feel so bad for those who do. Based on what I see exists in the lines of helpful people out there.  I assure you that I will be probably one of the first and one of the only to prove there are people out there to help others.   Because indeed people fall into situations they cant control. Hopefully    then all of you who got voted top responders who called me a scammer ect will be proved wrong now wont you..... asking me if Im Nigerian?  And questoning why I would borrow money if I cant pay it back.  Its nobodys business.  I think its time someone starts showing some brotherly love and compassion and I will show you hows its done in the coming year my friend. I do notice though that those who post to be lenders here are allowed to do so and  they are seldom replied to or shot down the way my post asking a simple queston is there anyone willing to give a loan was.  Makes me wonder really does.  ITs like ebay they are all out to suck up all the business for themselves and the honest guys just trying to sell some stufff cant do that because its just not a trustworthy environment. Please stop responding to people to become the top voted responders try answering to be helpful.  Of course your gonna get votes and Im sure you return that favor with votes and on and on and on. Im here to get help or  answers when I need them or to supply help to others who may need to know something.  My goal is not to become somone who gets top votes in hopes maybe yahoo will hire me one dayl   Just remember this my friends everything you do in life comes back to you in the end..I dont feel that others treated my queston with respect.

20090222124457AAmkN8Z	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What is the new politcally-correct term for calling "african-americans"?	Sorry if I offended anyone but i've posted several cultural questions and ive gotten a few rotten responses for calling african americans/ blacks an african american.    are we going back to afro-american? or are we just saying black now? i remember when i was in the 5th grade my teacher didnt allow me to say black because it was rude and she was an african american so thats what ive been saying.    i know these names change as they have over the years but i need to know what is the most up to date we are using now.    what are we calling the term now in the year 2009? specifically february/early march.

Yo teniendo miedo de que √©l lo viera de nuevo, decidi llamarle por telefono al dichoso Oscar para vernos y platicar con el (Mas que nada para tenerlo como supesto "amigo" y saber como es), y porteriormente decirle a mi novio que me vi con Oscar y platicamos y que creo que es una buena persona, y asi no sentiria tanto miedo si se llegan a encontrar.

After watching videos of that Bill Weise guy who went to hell and some videos other Christian pastors I have been very curious, and a little paranoid, about afterlife.    Are people in heaven and/or hell yet?   Do people not go to heaven or hell until the Rapture?   Is the fire and brimstone really physical?    I mean for communion when you drink Jesus' "blood" and eat his "flesh", the wine (or grapejuice) represents his blood and the bread represents his flesh, so why can't the lake of fire also be symbolical?   When you die do you just go straight to heaven or hell or do you go to some judgement place where the book of life is first?   Is hell really inside the earth, how can a spiritual realm be inside a physical planet, it makes no sense?!   Also god plans on destroying earth,so if he destroys it wouldn't hell also be destroyed if it is inside Earth.   Is hell in a seperate realm or in a distant place in the universe?   I have more questions but not enough space! Thanks in advance!

20081113162324AAS6ZP8	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	In your opinion, is there equality between genders?	Consider:   - Men, on average, make more money than women - not from working harder, but because of sexism.   - Women have the babies and are often the ones taking care of them.      On the other hand:      - Women can get laid any night of the week easily.   - Men have to open doors, pull back chairs, get out of the way, etc. for women.   - Men can't hit women, but women hit men with abandon.   - Women have the latitude to become bitchy, rude, self-centered, or difficult at will and are always excused.   - Men aren't able to marry a rich woman and never work again and get nice things, except John McCain. (I don't mean to suggest that all or even many or even more than 10% of women do this, but it happens and makes me upset.)      Don't shoot me down for this. I just want a public opinion.

20080925065110AAAQ3H9	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do Japanese  love Americans???	Now I don't want to step on any toes but...      I live in Japan and I really can't understand why the Japanese love Americans so much. I mean America bombed the **** out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the second world war and afterwards decided to brain wash Japan into thinking they were their friends.      After the war America gave the Japanese flour to make bread but America has too much flour so they have to sell it somewhere, so they found a good place to sell it (Japan) but Japan still has to buy it from America to this day. Also they checked Japanese txt books for schools and deleted the bad things that they did in the war to Japan.      So it really bugs me as to why Japanese love America and America continues to take advantage of a country that was held to near devistation in the second world war.      As I said, I don't want to step on any toes. I just want to get a better understanding

My friend is an Ahmadi and very proud of the fact that they are celebrating 100 years of khilafah. Whether folks call them Muslims or not, the fact remains that there is no other signs of khilafah anywhere in the world. This raises a question mark in my head as to what if he is right? Why is the Ummah so divided? How come they are united behind one man and claim to be 'true Muslims?

En Mateo 16:18 dice "Y yo digo que tu eres Pedro y sobre esta Roca edificar√© mi iglesia". Los cat√≥licos interpretan que Pedro es esa roca y el fundamento donde se edific√≥ la iglesia, pero el mismo Pedro dijo En hechos 4:11 "Este Jesus es la piedra reprobada por los edificadores, la cual ha venido hacer cabeza del √°ngulo". y otra vez Pedro habla de Jesus como la Piedra en 1Pedro 2:4-8 (Ver). El apostol Pablo dijo en 1Corintio 3:10-11 "porque yo como perito arquitecto puse el fundamento, y otro edificar√° encima; pero cada uno mire c√≥mo sobreedifica. Porque nadie puede poner otro fundamento que el que est√° puesto, el cual es Cristo". Ahora yo pregunto ?Qui√©n es la roca, la pidra sobre la que la iglesia esta edificada??Pedro el primer papa o Jesus?

20090203130005AAkC9nE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, what does God guide us to do in regards to fellow congregation members who have committed adultery?	So, there was a man at our church who wound up having an affair with a married woman (she and her husband also attend) some months ago.  The news came out and the first man no longer attends the church.  I met with all three of them, merely to listen to their stories and offer what I can.  I continue to know and be a friend to all of them.      A week ago, this man who left has invited a number of his old friends from church to his home for a "man night" of sorts - basically BBQ, beer and some action movie that our wives would never be caught dead watching.  Next thing I hear is that this has gotten back to the woman and her husband at church, who seem bothered by the fact that the first man is being involved with anyone at the church (yes, you read that - it gets better).      Now, I get an email from the man asking me "are we cool?" because he got an email from another one of the men from church saying that his "continuing to talk to people from church has put a strain on [the husband at church]. As well as putting those people in the middle."  He finishes his email by saying that if I want him to "just go away" he will do so.      Ok, it's obvious to most people that what is going on here is unacceptable.  I get that, I'm ahead of you.      What I'm really interested in is any references to scripture that guide us on how to address this.  By us, I mean all the players involved here.  I have a very good idea of "what would Jesus do" but I'm interested to hear more studied opinions if there are any out there at this moment and reading this, because I am less familiar with actual references and am looking for them so I may pass them on to some people.      God bless you, and thanks in advance.

It‚Äôs quite obvious that teaching teenagers how to avoid getting pregnant and STD‚Äôs whilst still experiencing sex is going to cut down on unwanted pregnancies and abortions in society, is it not? But isn‚Äôt there a general opposition from religious people to teaching sex-ed to teenagers? So, religious people are generally opposed to abortion yet their actions increase the number of abortions in society; what the hell is going on here? It‚Äôs as though they want there to be what they oppose in society in order for there to be something for them to oppose and get riled up over.

I don't really care what the girls thought because they didn't know anything about me, (and i've never even thought of girls in that way before eww!) but it still kinda made me feel a little bad that they would make fun of me just because i wasn't a **** like all of them were and i can't help that i'm real picky about guys and that my parents are super strict on me about guys (they even thought it was more important for me to get an education than a boyfriend, and they were real judgmental of people so i just avoided making any guy friends or trying to get a boyfriend) but now that i'm in college im like a freaking guy magnet, and i love being able to have friends that are guys but some girls still think that i'm a lesbian, has anyone ever had this kind of problem before? Also someone told me that's it's normal to experiment with someone of the same sex, what's normal about it!? I've never thought of girls in that way before, does this mean i have to experiment? And some girls say they just do it as a joke with their friends, but i'm not comfortable kissing another girl (i think it's disgusting and i was taught growing up that it's wrong to mess with someone of the same sex, no offense if your bi/lez) so...can someone answer my questions please?

SERIOUSLY..... as if I am 5 years old and will believe it... Now I have been taught A level/GCSE science and know more about the body, to me its a complete joke....      how do I get them to be quiet about it? I have openly told them numerous times face to face because I am not ashamed about it and because I believe its wrong to tell a child its bad to masturbate, that is a sure fire way that results in unwanted children...

Should the people in each of the 50 states be allowed to decide whether to fund abortions with tax dollars. Seeing how people are so divided on the issue, shouldn't we vote on it state by state?      Based on these economic hard times is it just a religious issue anymore?

20090203130630AAdwJWD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, do you think your appreciation?	and love for human life is stronger than MOST (not all) Christians and other monotheists?        Do you feel you value your own life on this planet more than most Christians and other monotheists value their time here?      I say yes, I appreciate people and life more, while my monotheist friends spend so much of their time worshiping and investing in God. I am investing in them, I often tell my friends and family my relationship with them means the world to me and then I devote my time to loving them.  My relationship with God means nothing to me, since I don't believe God exists or and if a loving God did exist, he would not accept worship. Anyone feel like I do?    I really like this feeling, it makes me feel like I have a much better understanding of how to live and who to love.

20090203130955AAZoRb1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I still don't understand the concept....?	As a Christian, I have been accused of thinking irrationally in a God Who is the Master of our universe.  As an "illogical" person, I guess I need help in understanding the concept of NO GOD, NO CREATOR, and NO ONE in control of things.   In general, MOST atheists will deny the existence of any form of a god outside themselves, but recognize that science is an organized and rational process.  I dare say that in order for science to be so methodical, it cannot be assumed that it got that way on its own, and that organization came from a random explosion or merging of cells, atoms, or particles.  If I toss sticks in the air and let the elements take over, after a thousand years I still won't get trees or a house.  I need seeds or grafts to make a tree.  Where do these seeds originate but from other trees?  So where did the first tree come from?  Certainly not from random atoms that came together and said, "gee,  I think we'll be a tree."  Who organized it?  And if you say "those atoms did it on their own", then those atoms are truly brilliant, and I should be recognizing their thinking as superior to my own.  In fact, maybe I should be worshipping those atoms?    Multiply that thinking by millions of plants, animals, and organisms, and try to convince yourself that every one of these things just "happened" by atoms and cells crashing together and "deciding" to make something.   Your body is a truly amazing collection of innovations, the basis for many inventions created by man, and yet NO man has been able to remotely excel in duplicating any part of the human body to perfection.   How can all these things be considered evolution of cells that began as random particles?

20090203131045AAvXmRb	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Would you LIE to get a job if unemployed?	My money is running out and my unemployment insurance will end soon. My unemployment only pays about 60% of my fixed expenses so I have had to pull money out of my retirement account and savings.      It is getting desperate and homelessness is a real possibilityy. There seems to be no jobs available similar to what I am trained for and am told I am over qualified for jobs that are lower paid and traditionally easier to get because I have a college degree and am 51 years old.      Would you lie and downplay your education and experience to get anyjob or would that be wrong?
20090222161816AAssZDv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are demons from Christian demonology real?	I'm just curious. I'm a Christian and I'm not 100% sure if demons exist. I believe in angels because my aunt told me she seen one by her son when he was in the hospital after a car accident. If demons are real do they have a specific look or are they just like voices in your head.      Do not insult me or my question. I know it's kind of dumb, but like I said, I'm just curious.      Thanks. ^_^
20090203125458AA9sJx8	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Are Black people more Racist than White people?	This question is so taboo and I hope no one takes offense to it because that is not my intention. I really want to know if you think that Black people are more racist toward white people than Whites are toward blacks? Personally, I feel like Black people are more often than not, racist towards white people. Whether they are making jokes about white people or even just giving me a dirty look for no reason               ( because i'm white??) Try riding the train in Dallas and being the only white girl..... everyone looks at me like I was some sort of an alien, and no... i'm not even being paranoid. This is just one example of racism i have experienced. please let me know what you think!

Ok, so I'm starting to make my halloween costume for this year, and I want to be a "witch" but I hate the over sexualized and stupid costumes that are put out there.  So I'm working on my own and I want it to be more accurate to what a "witch" would have worn back in the 1700's or so.  Anyways, my question is, what colors would have been worn?  I don't think they would wear all black like the commercialized costumes, so I was thinking more along the lines of greens, and browns..... any input to make it totally non offensive to Wiccan's and Pagan's,  and historically accurate, would be helpful.  Thanks
