Batter is safe at first.  NOTE  Batter might have been safe had the ss thrown to first.

The trucks I want are 7.75 (click at this link:       http://shop.ccs.com/item.do?categoryID=4...       Yeah they're tensor lows and I just want to know if I should get them even if I don't ride the same width? I never do rails or primo's so are there any other side effects of a different width than board width? Oh, and one last thing---I bought a pair of Destructo Low's and the kingpin dropped below the base of the truck, and because of that I was unable to do 50-50 grinds (which are like my main trick...) so are the Tensor Lows anything like that? THNKS      Oh, and I'll choose B.A. to whoever answers both parts.

But im not really sure which way i should choose. I already have 2 bikes, one BMX and another really nice mountain bike. I want to use my bikes as a way of getting around. But im also attracted by skateboards, and how much easier they are (smaller frame, can be carried around). But i do know that i might have to take a few falls.      I like both, but with bikes, they would be more likely to be stolen, they cant be carried around. But i like the fact that they go faster, easier to control and you can ride them come rain or shine.      I understand that with skateboards, you cant ride them in the rain or it will ruin the board and the plywood, trucks and griptape.      I would ride my bike pretty much anywhere and i want to see what you guys might think.

He has been in the league 13 years, all as a Laker in the West, never played the Knicks in the finals, so the most is 13 times.      Just pointing out that James and MJ are Eastern players, who play(played) the Knicks at MSG at least 2 times a year, if they are playing those days, and more if they played them in the Playoffs (2-6 times each year).       Bernard King was a Knick and had 60, but played at MSG 41+ games a year.       I just want to figure out his Percentage at MSG (not point percentage, but how many times it took him to get 61 points at MSG over MJ's and James' 55/50)!        It's kinda a big deal cuz MSG is the oldest Arena with the same team playing there in the NBA! The history there is incredible and Kobe did it again!!!

Lebron is a good player, but hes just not GREAT..I've seen about 20 lebron games this year, and i must say..he honestly can't shot a jumper or a 3 pointer worth a dam!..like 80% of the shots he makes are dunks/lay-ups, i mean do you really call that talent? Michael Jordan considered to be the greatest of all time to many, was able to do dunk/lay-ups, shot 3s, jumpers, and make free throws! Michael Jordan Was a cluth player, Lebron just isn't. To me in my eyes Lebron is the second best player in the NBA right now, but far from the best player in the NBA.      The best player in the NBA has alot of similaritys to Michael Jordan, they Both are cluth players, both are probably the best 2 closers to ever play in the NBA, but Lebron just doesn't have a all around talent like MJ. He has amazing dunks! but thats about it, he honestly needs to become an all around shooter for me to consider him as good as MJ, and other players like Kobe who have that all around shooting talent that LeBron doesn't. Im a MJ fan and a bulls fan, but i must admit, Kobes as close as it gets to MJ, Lebrons is overrated when it comes to comparing him to players like MJ and Kobe. I dont mean to be harsh Lebron fans, but its the truth. Lebrons already been in the league 5 years, by now he should be showing that hes cluth and is a all around shooter/player.

20070604001010AA1HuBH	Sports;Basketball	I hate to say it, I really hate to say it, but without Kobe the NBA wouldn't be the same?	I really hate Kobe, I really do. But without Kobe the NBA would pretty much be dead. The NBA is pretty much dying, and the few superstars in the NBA are the only people who are keeping the NBA alive. And if you don't believe the NBA is dying, the ratings went from 20m to 2m viewers. Go to google.com and put in nba ratings, theirs your source. So no matter how much I hate Kobe, he's actually keeping the NBA alive...

This one league I'm in had their draft last weekend and I didn't get a chance to draft for myself because of strep throat.. Anyways I was drafted a half decent team with the exception of these idiots..    I understand that Valverde and Weathers will open as the teams Closers. But how much stock can you actually put into that?    Benitez is being shopped by teams to become a setup man.    Clemens is Clemens but do I actually want to wait until June to reep the rewards?   As for Jeremy Sowers, I don't know much about him except that he's a decent young starter for Cleveland.    As for now, I'll probably keep the two closers and Sowers but I'm not sure about Clemens and Benitez. What do you guys think?    There is not much out there in FA's, but Pelfrey is still available (pending he makes the team as a starter) and a few others..
