I know lots of people are gonna say that it sucks cuz its no an FPS but that is not the case. If you think about it, Halo Wars isn't a sequal to any Halos, it is a prequal to show the beginnings to the Covenant-Human wars. Its way more fun than reading the books (I read most of them, I know). People only hate Halo Wars cuz its got Halo in the name and it is a totally different game. I think it is awesome cuz they used some creatures that never made it to the Halo series but were planned to (Engineers). And there is already another Halo FPS going to be released this year (Halo ODST), what do these people want! Lol. So yeah. Halo Wars is an awesome game.|`|ad2faoKcaa	Halo Wars is a good game !|`|FDLXEEDnaa	It's a good game, but it suffers from the same things that any console-bound RTS suffers from, the bogged-down, inefficient selection and command process.

Merlina, A wizard princess summons Sonic into the world of King Aurthur. Sonic falls down into there world, (much like Sonic Unleashed if you have that). He then meets Merlina, and goes through some tutorials on how to do things in the game. You then go to a cut scene where Sonic can be seen pulling the sword Caliburn out of a rock like thing. Caliburn is a special sword as it picks it bearer. This sword will then be his guide for the rest of the game, talking to him mostly to make smart comments about Sonic's *********, and to give him hints and help.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped....<br>  Jess

The DSi also has software that allows you to make songs sound weird and make pictures look wierd. If you have a DS and like playing pokemon or guitar hero then stick with the DS lite.t would proabably be better in the long run to get the DSi because eventually they will come out with exclusives gor it and may even only make games for the DSi.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|M2AFI8ZDaa	I know nothing about the psp 3000 but I consider the dsi, worse than the DS or about equal.

nfb6VTK5aa	Here are the diffrences<br>  <br>  DSi: HARDWARE <br>  The Nintendo DSi is about 12% thinner (2.6 mm) than the Nintendo DS Lite. The new handheld has two VGA (0.3 megapixel)[24] digital cameras; one on the internal hinge pointed towards the user and the second one in the outer shell.[25][26] It also has larger screens (3.25 inches, instead of the previous 3 inches) and improved speakers.[8] Yui Ehara, the designer of DSi's outer shell, wanted to keep the unit "neat" and "simple" with its new features. The power switch has been replaced with a power button, as the original DS had, now located next to the bottom left side of the touchscreen. For DS software its power button also serves as a soft reset to return to the main menu. While for DSi software, Kentaro Mita who is responsible for relaying ideas from the company to the team commented "you can move around, return to the menu, or play a different game, without shutting down the power every time".[13] Once at the main menu, DS cards can be hotswapped.[27] The DSi has a matte surface to prevent fingerprints from showing up, as opposed to the glossier finish the DS Lite has. The speaker apertures were altered due to the redundancy of circular perforations on its shell and since the change can be noticeable while keeping the unit neat. Ehara pushed for this alteration to also make consumers see more of a distinction between the DSi and its predecessors.[13] Excluding North America, Nintendo will release the handheld in both matte black and matte white. Japan will receive pink, lime green and metallic blue colors on March 20, 2009.[28]<br>  The DSi has five brightness settings compared to the DS Lite's four; however, battery life is reduced to 9–14 hours on the lowest brightness setting compared to the 15–19 hours of its predecessor.[29]<br>  Nintendo stated that, to improve portability without sacrificing durability, the front slot for Game Boy Advance (GBA) cartridges has been removed.[8] Thus removing the unit's backward compatibility with GBA Game Paks[30] and its compatibility with accessories that require the GBA slot, such as the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak; as well as the Guitar Hero: On Tour and Guitar Hero: On Tour Decades grip, which is required for those games.[31]<br>  Technical specifications<br>  Nintendo has released few technical details regarding the DSi system. Nintendo has also improved some of the DSi's hardware (compared to the DS Lite), such as the main CPU and the RAM.[32][33]<br>  CPUs: The main CPU is an ARM processor clocked at 133 MHz.[34][35]<br>  RAM: 16 MB of RAM (four times more than previous models)[33]<br>  Storage: 256 MB of internal Flash memory[36]<br>  Wireless: 802.11 internal wireless connectivity[37]<br>  <br>  <br>  FEATURES:<br>  An SD card slot hides behind the cover on the right-side of the handheld. The SD card can be used for external storage of pictures, downloaded software and to play AAC audio.[38] The built-in audio player feature serves as a voice recorder and music player of AAC audio, but does not support MP3s. This media player can also adjust pitch, playback and add filters to the aforementioned audio. Using the handhelds' internal microphone, the audio player can save and modify up to eighteen ten-second sound clips from voice recordings then apply them to songs.[39][40] Photos taken using the DSi can be synced to the Wii's Photo Channel.[8]<br>  Similar to its competitor, the PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo's own Wii console, the DSi has upgradable firmware; a first for a Nintendo handheld system. All existing homebrew flash cards for the Nintendo DS and DS Lite are incompatible with the DSi,[41] but cards that can run DS software on a DSi are now being produced – the first one was created by Acekard.[42]<br>  Nintendo has reported that the DSi uses region locking for DSi-specific software, since the handheld provides Internet services tailored individually for each region and it uses rating-based parental controls, which differ by country. However, certain elements are region-free: Internet browsing, photo sharing and Nintendo DS software.[43] The WPA and WPA2 support is not backward compatible with original DS games. Only DSi services can use WPA.[44]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PSP:<br>  <br>  HARDWARE<br>  The PSP Slim & Lite offers a 19% slimmer (reduced to 18.6 mm from 23 mm) and 33% lighter (reduced to 189 grams [6.66 ounces] from 280 grams [9.87 ounces]) system than the original PSP system.[3][5] Internal changes to achieve this include the removal of a metal chassis (used to reduce damage in the event of sudden trauma to the system resulting from the user dropping the system on a hard surface). However, users have complained from generally poor hardware assembly like misaligned faceplates[6] and loose/creaky battery covers,[7] unlike the highly praised original PSP hardware.[8]<br>  Other changes include improved WLAN modules and Micro-controller, and a thinner and much brighter LCD.[9] To target the original PSP generation's poor load times for UMD games,[10] the internal memory (RAM and Flash ROM|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	I think the DS is better than the PSP when it comes to games.  The PSP have very few really good games, while the DS has a lot of really good games.  <br>  <br>  It should be interesting what kind of games are available for download.  Some people are really good at making games, and others just suck at it, so it should be interesting to see how Nintendo is going to handle this.  Is Nintendo going to treat it like the Wii where anyone can make a game without Nintendo's approval, or will Nintendo go back to NES/SNES days where every game has to meet Nintendo's standards.<br>  <br>  The PSP picture is what the PSP might look like if Sony removes the UMD drive.|`|nhUmHE7Zaa	idk if that psp is real or fake but i do know this<br>  <br>  IF modding is important to you, i'd say get the psp but if u don't mod than possibly the dsi but i'd still get the psp cuz u can go on the internet and a bunch of other stuff|`|eoh8Ad6laa	i dont think that is a real psp . it looks like one i saw on the news a man was trying to sell it but it was not real he just took peoples money and never sent them one because it is just a cool pic that he made up<br>  <br>  <br>  vote me as best answer please|`|yHaGnT4gaa	the psp is fake<br>  <br>  you should get a psp not a dsi<br>  it has way better games and graphics.|`|TmWTesu1aa	dont get either just get the ds lite because i think nintendo are just trying to rip people off with that dsi gimmik and i dont like the psp because i think it's games sucks|`|YZowEwCoaa	DSI. Totally. First, a PSP will break easily. Secondly, DSI graphics are okay, but you have to take in consideration of the DSI's features.<br>  <br>  A camera (which I here will allow unlimited picture storage, but I wouldn't count on Nintendo to do something like that )<br>  <br>  A music Player built in! Plug in some headphones, And jam to your tunes while playing a DSI game!<br>  <br>  And if you can get it hooked up to the internet, there is an online shop!<br>  The DSI is 169.99 and comes out in April. So you'd have to wait for a DSI compared to having a PSP now. I'd go with The DSI. Although I like Nintendo and Sony, I just like the DSI more. It sounds really good. Hopefully Nintendo won't let me (and possibly you if you decide to get one) down!<br>  PS: That PSP in the picture looks suspicous... But with a DSI you don't have to worry about fakes! ; )
0DDlABTraa	I like time crisis for ps2. It's pretty old (though I think there's like 2 and 3) but it's really fun. I think you're out of luck for the psp, though. There aren't that many games for it and no FPSs that I have found.|`|ylpKqa4raa	Only On PlayStation - Resistance : Retribution（Resistance : Houfuku no Koku) For PSP game.<br>  <br>  U can look here:<a href="http://www.bendgamestudio.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bendgamestudio.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Games/Resistance_Retribution" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Games/...</a><br>  <br>  Jacky|`|s2fKvOJNaa	Both consoles are horribly minimal on FPS'. You won't find much, or basically anything for that matter. Play Square Enix games. They're MUCH cooler. (That is, unless you wanna play 007: nightfire)
LbHVgEwOaa	Let me list a few strong points to help you decide.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  <br>  Has more exclusive games<br>  Has a larger amount of players<br>  NEW systems rarely get RROD<br>  Has several games (like Halo) that are very popular<br>  Less expensive<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  <br>  Free online play<br>  No RROD<br>  Games are in higher detail<br>  <br>  Now both of them have more key elements but I thought I'd just list a few. I've been through 3 Xbox 360s myself, I finally got a hold of one that hasn't RROD'd. In the end I'd say it's up to your budget, which exclusives you like, and which Controller feels the best to you. Do you have enough money to buy a souped up ps3? Do you plan to play online? Do you have enough to continuously pay for online play? Do you have enough patience to wait for your RROD to get fixed if you buy a used 360?|`|0kJ4apHraa	Oh My God, if I see this question again I might slap my brother. I swear it. DO NOT get a 360. A ps3 will definitely be the right choice. PlayStation Network is free unlike live and MAG is coming out this year Research it. MAG|`|g5T8nrKLaa	From your picks of games 100% sure an xbox 360 but get xbox live!|`|KflJYExvaa	If you can, get both because both consoles have their pluses and minuses. Since you want multiplayer games though, I would suggest getting the 360 because, overall, it has the better multiplayer games, though the ps3 does have Resistance 2 and now Killzone 2. Plus, the 360 seems to be getting all the RPGs this time around (it's even getting FFXIII) and has most of the good racing games out there as well.|`|h0p3O1dPaa	xbox and ps3 are great online. but when you want it to have good graphics than ps3 completes it. its hi def picture is amazing. that sound is great too. plus, everything is blutooh so you have extremly good wireless. i could bring my blutooth into another and still be able to talk to my friend in great quality when the ps3 is in another room. i can even mess around with the game by controlling it from another room<br>  <br>  edit: also, the ps3 is free online too :)|`|3OH6rbmGaa	Get the 360 because you can play online it has more games out than the ps3 and alot more people have the 360 than the ps3|`|LzUglOhhaa	Hey your choice to choose my man/woman. So far what you've stated above all I can say is: Look into it.<br>  <br>  PS3 has some games that X360 don't, and Vice Versa<br>  <br>  PS3-Metal Gear Solid 4, Resistance 1 & 2, etc.<br>  (Ps3 also is blu-ray, so the games are more high-def and more expensive, even in a worn condition)<br>  <br>  X360-Halo Trilogy, others to come, and the upcoming Ninja Blade<br>  (X360's Live is needed for most multiplayer games, and can be a drag to pay $20 a month, and the peeps online are generally more rude)<br>  <br>  So you now, depending on what you love and what company you want to support is up to you.|`|86c457b83e82f65546759f220394e207aa	honestly ive had a ps3 and an xbox 360, what i can tell, you is yes the xbox live on the xbox is better than the ps3's online. But i had many, many problems with my xbox, and so did my friends, online many people can hack the xbox because it's not as high tech as the ps3, as for game choice the xbox has a bigger variety, but ps3 has alot of the games xbox has. And when it come to price the xbox is indeed cheaper, but the better deal for you money i would say is the ps3, the graphics are better on the ps3, online is free and the blu ray player is it , onceyou see a movie on it, the movie theaters quility looks bad!.  But it all depends what you are looking for in it, if you want to get the xbox for halo and gears of war then thats really the only main games that are xbox 360 exclusives. <br>  <br>  <br>  So my point is after having both systems  i play my playstation 3 more, i like it more, and i think its a better value for your money!|`|jTn89LYTaa	I would get a ps3 because they have waaaayyyyy better features and sound effects but thats what I think hope this helps|`|cYHxERCSaa	ps3, great graphics and xbox has the crappy red ring of death|`|ODuFWG4Caa	the ps3 we have more to do but i think you should get an xbox 360 because it has better games

iZsz1nhoaa	F/P - FAIL IN GENERAL!!<br>  I/L - If you want to pack some damage and stuffs, then this is certainly the job for you. This job does a lot more damage then the other mage jobs. This job is a bit better than F/P during 4th job, so that is why F/P really sucks. This job really sucks up your money though, and so does F/P. Leveling up should be normal for every level.<br>  <br>  Cleric - This job is a bit difficult at first but REALLY pays off. The reason for this is because Clerics have no attacks (besides holy arrow, but its weak) until 3rd job. So leveling up is pretty difficult from lvl 30-70 but don't be discouraged YET! :D<br>  <br>  At 3rd job, the Priest learns one of the MOST USEFULL supportive skills in MS. It is called Holy Symbol. All high level warriors will give you leach and easy training if you have high Holy Symbol. This makes training FAR EASIER during lvl 70-120 then I/L and F/P. Plus This job takes little money to fund. <br>  <br>  At 4th job, Bishops become REAL money makers! You can sell leech for 8mil/hr at harps or anywhere you want. Its essentially money for training which is AWESOME!<br>  <br>  <br>  Soooo, to conclude everything, If you want to be poor but strong, be an Ice/Lightning. If you want to become weak but rich and level up fast, then become a cleric.<br>  <br>  Its as easy as that! Good luck with your choice!|`|mTmonRD8aa	Neither, quit, its boring or hack and become a cleric|`|AvnG6t4baa	cleric=heal, they are very good party people, and after your 3rd job, you will have holy symbol. Bless is a good move, as when maxed, it gives +20to wdef, +20 mdef, +20 avoid and acc. They are known to party with DK (dragon knight, 3rd job for spearman) due to the fact that they have Hyper body, Increase HP and Mp, then clerics can heal that. Clerics heal can mob undead monsters<br>  <br>  Ice/lightning: Great class, they are the first 2nd mage class to get mob attacking (lightning) other than the clerics heal, but it works only on undead monster. Ice beam freezes monster, very useful for noob sins that have 1 in drain punch. Meditate boosted m att, it is like bless, but only increase m att. the only class that can freeze other than white knight (3 rd job for page)<br>  <br>  Fire/poison: They have absolutely no mob attack, However, they have the highest base damage with fire arrow. The can poison like no other class. has meditate too

miQRDqQqaa	Yes! There are a couple of things you can do to help with the slug boss(es). If you are referring to the worms that grab you by the foot, then your best friend is the Force Gun. Point it in the general direction of the yellow blob and Isaac will blow that mofo to bits. It even works on Impossible mode, if you bother to upgrade. My favorite gun, it is cheap to upgrade and the most useful weapon beside the plasma cutter in the game. Since your aim is double-inverted (horizontal AND vertical) from whatever you normally use when grabbed by this guy, you can just press start, change your controls to invert both, and it will counteract the problem while he has you by the foot.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are fighting the large slug, it's all about timing. Once you get that down you can just jump out of the way of the tentacles, and shoot the yellow spots in between. Tips: 1) wait til it waves in the characteristic way indicating it's about to swipe you before you jump. 2) Don't use guns that have limited range or take a while to reach their target: ie, Force Gun, Flamethrower, Line Gun. 3) use the red canisters to blow up multiple blobs at once

To reach that world, if you have all the Navi-G pieces. You need to go through the newest warphole that has appeared, if I'm not mistaken near Traverse Town.

MCITbIlSaa	Press <Ctrl>-<Shift>-C to bring up the console on top, then type the following:<br>  <br>  boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true <Press Enter><br>  <br>  Once you've enabled the cheat:<br>  If you hold down SHIFT and click on an object, more options will be available. If you are in Create-A-Sim, if you hold down SHIFT+N, hidden clothes and hair will show up, such as NPC outfits and Work outfits. If you enter this in Neighborhood View, when you enter a lot you can raise Skill Points, Relationships, Personalities and Interests by just dragging the bars up to the level you want. (This cheat can be dangerous and caution should be used whilst having it on).<br>  <br>  When you're done, Press <Ctrl>-<Shift>-C and type:<br>  <br>  boolProp testingCheatsEnabled false <Press Enter><br>  <br>  And you can resume normal game play.<br>  <br>  This cheat gives you the powers of a God in the Sim world, don't let it go to your head.<br>  <br>  Happy Simming!|`|eS9MfSvmaa	***Note: When you type things in, be sure to pay attention to capitalization.<br>  <br>  1. Hold down Shift+Ctrl+C to open the cheat box to type into<br>  2. Type in: boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true<br>  (before you type that in and you know your going to be typing a lot of things in the cheat box, just type in some random letters and it'll expand so it won't close when you type a cheat in. When you want to close it, just type in: exit)<br>  3. hit Shift+N. Once you've done this, you can go to any bars (needs, relationships, skills, interests or personality) and change them to however high or low you want, just click on the bar and run your mouse over it (be sure to keep holding when doing that)<br>  4. Another thing that could be useful is if you don't want the needs bar to go down just type in: MotiveDecay off<br>  <br>  If you want the needs to start reducing again, type in: MotiveDecay on<br>  Also, if you leave the place where you typed in MotiveDecay off, it'll be on (ex: going from your house to a community lot = MotiveDecay will be on at community lot).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! :]

Dso7k3sjaa	Yes, try removing the items you downloaded. Normally clothing and hair won't cause problems though, but try that anyway.  You can always put it back after the baby is born -- at least until it causes problems again anyway, which it may not.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when people download weird custom skins, such as tiger skins or mermaid skins that will often cause the game to crash when the sim is about to give birth because the game is trying to make a "baby" sim using the parents skins and many times those skins don't actually have a "baby" version so the game crashes.  Either that or the player picks a dad that's say, a tiger and a mom that's a bear and when the game tries to combine the two different skins it can't so that also causes it to crash.<br>  <br>  Normally hair and clothing don't cause that to happen, but I suppose that hair could, so just remove it at least until she gives birth.  Good luck!|`|6f88839fbee1fe90fe41d23fa34307ecaa	You could try moving her out of the house ....you will lose all of your furniture though...but moving her into another house may reset the pregnancy....other then that you could try forcing the pregancy with a hack...good luck!

This is because there is a BALANCE TO RANDOMNESS when multiple numbers are being picked from a pool of numbers.  If all you are trying to pick is one number out of 53 than yes, each individual one number has an equal chance of being chosen.  This all changes when you are trying to pick multiple random numbers out of the same pool of numbers. Out of, say, a pool of 53 numbers, you will see numbers somewhat spread out from 1 to 53 within the range of the numbers of the particular Lotto you are playing.  The major Lotto games have you choose five numbers with a separate mega number.   This being so, your 5 numbers should add up to around 150 to 165.  Add up the last 100 lotto results and see what the average totals are.  Pick your numbers to add up within that range.  As your mega number use the number that is the most frequent one picked from the stats given on the lotto website.  Or just use any mega number as this is the case where any one number is just as likely to be drawn as any other number.  Good luck.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Maybe they like their job.

Dso7k3sjaa	Yea, unfortunately all three people are correct.  Not that I mind them being correct, but I just wanted to tell you that you can't get the fruit back out of the fridge once it's been put in.  At least you know now so next time you can stock the juicer instead.|`|VyhegRF9aa	you have to have the fruit in your inventory then click on the juicer then click stock then put all the fruit you can in it .<br>  <br>  then you can make juice|`|RpCwfcRzaa	You have to have the fruit in your Sims' inventory and then click on the juicer. An option will come up to stock it. I usually put half of the harvested fruits and veggies in the fridge and the other half in the juicer.|`|bDbXGNYhaa	from your inventory you have to stock up the juicer not the fridge.  then theres the options when you click on it

L0Jrx5anaa	it is control+shift+c and if it's taking pictures you are possibly letting go of control too early otherwise it is just your keyboard.|`|LMvzxsM3aa	make sure you press shift+ctrl+C all at the same time. Just pressing C stands for camera so it will only keep taking pictures.
AA11989868	You may currently be banned off of xbox live, or your connection may bail out during sign in, it takes less power to show the connection than to log a profile in, you can find the Xbox Live support number at xbox dot com, but its regional, I am going to assume you live in america<br>   call the number<br>  <br>  1-800-4MY-XBOX<br>  <br>  you will get a machine, if you say enogh things it doesnt understand after you specify your console, a REAL employee will help you out
Me14R9gKaa	Play Search and Destroy... use an M16. Hopefully you got to play some this last week, they had double XP all week long! <br>  <br>  You should try to avoid Team Deathmatch... you really don't get that much XP unless you kill  A LOT of people. In S&D you only need 2 kills to get 100 pts, and it Team Deathmatch you need 10. <br>  <br>  Try headquarters too. Good luck... maybe I'll see ya out there someday.|`|wHuUWayoaa	3 things...Practice, Practicee anddd (no prizes for guessing what comes next) Practice =P<br>  <br>  but seriously, you should try and stick to one gun until you get better at it.<br>  <br>  donttt sprint around corners<br>  Dont go runnin out in the open, gunz blazing, thinking your all heroic..cuz your just an easy target for snipers.....and pretty much anyone to be honest<br>  <br>  <br>  Ak 47 (or ak 47 u) + Red dot<br>  Bandolier<br>  stopping power<br>  ...+ the accuracy perk (sorry forgotten what its called)|`|QoHMIYGzaa	never sprint through a map, stick to corners! you dont get shot as much, i never sprint cuz then u have to pull up your gun when you come to contact

xi9sOmEXaa	I myself have a Blood Elf Pally. I'm more of an alliance fan than horde, but I thought I'd try it out. Don't worry about 'good guys' or 'bad guys', just have fun. Besides, being evil can be interesting. My main is a Draenai Pally, but horde can be pretty entertaining too.<br>  In conclusion: Who cares? Just go have fun.|`|7An35QYPaa	No, you're probably going to hell.  I mean get ready to spend eternity in agony.
qfVuQR4Iaa	depending on where you sell it it could be any where from 5 to ten bucks.Its a good card but the most anyone would want it for is maybe 10 dollars.|`|AA11989868	Its ACTUAL value is about a nickel, but to someone that plays that card would probably go for ... maybe 7 bucks if your really lucky|`|TOilCuG3aa	probably 5$ at most|`|QzD3rJtMaa	Well the online store that I buy Yugioh cards from sells it for about $7.  So its real worth is probably around half that, $5 max.|`|Q3FdhYgRaa	Not much, i'd say max 5 bucks or however much a shonen jump magazine is worth.
BB4Qd9ymaa	Unfortunately they probably will.<br>  <br>  SOCOM has always had the worst gamepaly and controls for shooting games, but they wont stop now. Not with all the money they make with every new socom.  Expect it in a years time or so.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	After the last flop of a game, they may have lost their hardcore fan base. <br>  <br>  They could potentially make another one, but if its as bad as confrontation, they are in for some trouble. Financial trouble that is.
EVjoCpjEaa	You've forgotten the fishing rod. Easy mistake.<br>  <br>  You need to get the fishing rod from Galen (he lives in the house surrounded by the square field).<br>  <br>  Go to his house between 12-2pm. Make sure you're rucksack slots are empty.<br>  <a href="http://www.fogu.com/hm6/chan2/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fogu.com/hm6/chan2/index.php</a>
AA11612795	I don't know about all of them, but the Chorrol Mage's Guild hall specializes in Conjuration spells, which is the school of magic needed to cast Bound spells, so you should be able to buy most of them there.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that Bound Spells aren't all that great.  The armor spells are hit and miss, so unless you are skilled in both Light and Heavy armor, you might not get quite what you bargained for.  The Bound Sword is also a Claymore, so if you prefer One-Handed Blades, you either are stuck with the dagger, or nothing.<br>  <br>  Speaking of the Bound Dagger, that spell is available at Edgar's Discount Spells in the Imperial City.
510MC9SVaa	It depends on how much you are selling it for and how well the economy is in your area.|`|lxMsRjY0aa	Im interested in it|`|BxTAfd2baa	In my opinion, i think you will have a hard time selling it as it is.  Most people are looking to the next generation of stations and aren't interested in an old machine.  Who knows, you might get lucky.  However, don't go to Gamestop.  They will rip you off.|`|sre4rOK2aa	depends on the games and the price ill buy the ps2 though

Z8I2TxXNaa	If you only have 4GB of Memory left on your computer, I suggest uninstalling some programs.<br>  <br>  Do not get this confused with RAM...they are different. Not to mention, I know for a fact it doesn't need 17GB of memory because I used to play WoW religiously.|`|SNACHcceaa	try 13GB|`|LIjeBLG7aa	I have the same problem cant download it on to a CD my computer doesnt read DVD's and there is no where on my computer that can store 15GB ( thats what it says) someone please help her
O8kke1X5aa	horde, the alliance are a race of evil scum bags who deserve do have all their heads decapitated by orcs, why u say, because we have lox, yes i know u have lox too but urs are fake, them alli folk no nothing about dark magic!!!111 and we have chocloate chip internet cookies, so yeahaha alliance, i mean horde!!!! for da horde mon forever eayaahha yeah!!|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Horde has better racial skills. Alliance has better designed cities in terms of layout.<br>  Other than that, not much difference.|`|abTZX46faa	only horde can use the 'flaming sword of the orc' (one handed sword) and only alliance can use 'blessed mace of the dwarf' (healing mace). There are no counterparts to these for the opposite faction and are respectively the best of their kind, coming out in the patch after the next one.|`|SNACHcceaa	For the Horde!<br>  <br>  Alliance may be pretty But So are blood elves :D<br>  Horde is evil, evil is the coolest.. its what the kewl kids do<br>  You can be a fat green human or or a tall blue indian with a mohawk or or a skinny human with elvish ears or  a skeleton dead like human :d yeah its kewl here... join the darkside we got cookies.
iZsz1nhoaa	You should be able to do it with winrar. Just open winrar and go to extract files and click on your vice city. It should work, and try looking for the "vicecity.exe" or something with ".exe". Otherwise It seems like a virus folder and it might not even contain vice city.<br>  <br>  Downloading vice city on the internet is illegal so I have no clue where to get it lol.
btX6mM3Taa	They use magic to fix themselves. It is the same magic that makes the chocolate frogs actually hop around.|`|23bd10ee1616e312c4aa6bbcf7a1673baa	I'm pretty sure once the game has ended they automatically are fixed.|`|Y1dJOpCUaa	They regenerate.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	What do you think?  Any time a site asks for a password, it's a scam.  <br>  <br>  Have you paid attention to some of the scam questions on here?  Some people pretend they're a Jagex employee and found a way to get free membership accounts.  All you had to do was enter your name and password.
zXss9LQpaa	there are only 150 stars in the game. if you have all 150 then you have completed the game. the toads just say the same thing over and over. you can replay some of the stars if you want but other than that there isn't really much more (if anything) to do.|`|abTZX46faa	play a different game
Q3FdhYgRaa	Reorganize your list into monster spell and traps|`|TOilCuG3aa	too many monsters
LQlrD4Juaa	eventually when they get tired of their wii $$|`|uctxzjIIaa	Game consoles always get replaced like that every 5 years or so. The only ways to not have the problem you are talking about are to not buy game consoles at all, or to buy them right as they come out (so you have 5 years before they get replaced)|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The same can be said for the 360.  If the average life span of a system is 5 years, the next Xbox will come out in late 2010.  The next Nintendo system won't come out until late 2011.<br>  <br>  Until E3 comes around, nobody really knows when the systems will be released.  The only system that's guarantee to be around after 2010 is the PS3.<br>  <br>  Just get whatever system she wants and let her enjoy it.|`|kz8xZj91aa	yes you are right the will get replaced soon but don't worry the best thing you can do is to buy your sister a pc the ultimate gaming machine according to me listen carefully you can download emulators or buy them these emulators enable you to play console games on you pc i have a ds lite emulator if you want to see that visit<br>  <br>  <a href="http://anishdbz.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/nogba-emulator/" rel="nofollow">http://anishdbz.wordpress.com/2009/02/28...</a><br>  then go to the roms page and download games
vToCW00Vaa	The subscription only works with one gamertag. In order to play online on the other account you'd have to buy another gold subscription. <br>  <br>  You cannot transfer gold memberships.|`|xTQQEfw9aa	Wow dude you wont buy again because of that? Anyway... No you cant both play from the same membership from different accounts. No you cant transfer memberships. And yes you will have to buy another membership. And Im sure PS3 is the same way. Not sure about the Wii|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Guess you won't be another Xbox in the future.<br>  <br>  Only 1 gamertag can use the membership even if you have multiple gamertags on the same machine.  It sucks, but that's how MS rips you off.<br>  <br>  You cannot transfer membership from one gamertag to another.

Ro0Yj3cFaa	thes are ok for like 10 or 11 year old beginners but the problem is with only the 4 pads it is very basic and it will get boring fast. Unfortunately if you want a good electric drum kit that you will not have to replace in like 3 months you will have to spend at the least like 300 or 400$ sorry but you can get Thes ones to begin with. I could not tell form your URLs the brand of them but if you tell me I will let you know what the sound quality will be for them.

Once you get tem he will summon the elemental and you will kill it then you can choose your whirlwind weapen.

AA10926720	Hamachi is a vpn emulator.<br>  <br>  Basically it makes all the computers on the internet that are connected to your hamachi network like if they were right next to you in a LAN. <br>  <br>  So you have to be in a hamachi network and there has to be a game server (in your case l4d) running, then you join to the game by loggin into the server.<br>  <br>  for example you can come to my saints row 2 network<br>  sr2cali password is zz<br>  <br>  right, now (YOU have to have the game "configured" to use hamachi as the network adapter) you ask me if i can play or i ask the people if anybody wants to play , so we agree, THEN  in game we click on player match ,LAN (or in this case tru command line like "connet ip x.xx.x.1") and join server.<br>  <br>  So i hope that gives you an idea how it works.<br>  <br>  Is not like playing an internet game where you click on search and get a list (well you do, but you have to belong to a hamachi network,),<br>  and then click and join.<br>  <br>  I could tell you more but , i dont think i should post info like that in here.<br>  <br>  I remembered somehting::<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.overclock.net/pc-games/417175-l4d-over-hamachi-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.overclock.net/pc-games/417175...</a>

''you still have to focus on your career ok?'' and she just said ''oh yeah right''<br>  <br>  So for me.it's not weird just ignore em'.because it's so damn cool! just continue playing those fantastic 360 games.she totally liked Dead Rising and Left 4 Dead,she loves Zombies.

dDR4RGrbaa	If you're a free player, then yes, all the corrupt dragon armor and weapons breaks after a short period of time.

Plug your 360 in to the TV and make sure it works.<br>  2. Take your wii disc out and put it into the cd drive<br>  3. If it cannot read the disc,  you take the disc out and follow the next steps.<br>  4. You unplug your 360 from the wall and tv.<br>  5. You take your 360 and throw it against a brick wall as hard as you can. (this should open the case and give you access to the motherboard)<br>  6.  Jump up and down on it before you pick it up.<br>  7.  Start screaming and cussing and eventually say, "F__k it!"<br>  8.  Get your Nintendo Wii out and hook it up to the TV.<br>  9. Attach the controllers to the Wii.<br>  8. Put the disc in it. and enjoy.<br>  Now you got your discs to work and have a busted up 360.  You will no longer need to ask about wii games on the 360 cause it would not work anyway.|`|WfHRRCZfaa	They don't, mainly because console sales rarely make profit, so companies like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo make money on the royalties they collect from games.

You can find them outside of the barbarian village. There is a small room with a locked door that you have to use a key on to get inside. Buy the key from the gangsters in Varrock or from a player and use it on the door. Climb down the ladder into a dungeon and go straight into this large room. You will see these large giants. They have high hp but low defense. have fun!<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW: i highly suggest you quit runescape. There are much better mmos out there.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pwi.perfectworld.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pwi.perfectworld.com/</a><br>  best mmo|`|zP1OucSuaa	If you are a level 68 ankous might be a little dangerous. Killing hill giants gives you experience and if you run between the bank and the cave you can sell the big bones for a nice profit. Ogres outside of castle wars might be a stretch because they are around level 60, but if your up for it you can try. Oh, by the way if I were you I would switch from RuneScape to GuildWars or World of Warcraft because RuneScape is trash compared to the opposition (GW and WoW).

lDSjohocaa	Well It Is probably true because if you stuck it in a day care it would have around about 120 see i have experimented over night and have found out if you train on steel, water, electric, and normal its effects will be over 395 but if you train on every type you my end up with it on with about 395.<br>  see if you trained it on gyrados it will have the number around 210 cause they have lots of exp but little skill lvl. in other words it depends on what you battle|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Nope the max is 395. I cannot think of an explination although I will try.<br>  <br>  First it could be an in-game glitch either due to something in the programming or a secondary effect of a different cheat, something random. Second it could be a leftover cheat if the game was bought used. Those are the only two things I can think of.|`|fOTo4afBaa	mayber because of the nature of your glaceon, or u EV trained it, but wow, a high stats, you should be grateful, OR maybe ur glaceon has a pokerus(pokemon virus, it lets ur pokemon's stats go up)

3Jk9vNZTaa	i did mine at the mini mega ramp. first i saw about where i usually landed. then i gathered 3 trash cans and lined them up in the spot. i went down the ramp and once i got off i bailed and did a canon ball while spinning... and yeah i hit the objects while rolling. it took a while but you'll get it done.

IfbkuHZfaa	There is no definitive "better" class but there are classes more suited towards your play style. <br>  Warlocks have insane DoTs (Damage over time), hard hitting spells, get free mounts, are very good at pvp, and always have a minion which definitely comes in handy. Although locks are squishy and when played wrong can get slaughtered by any decent player. And, besides crowd control and dps they don't really have a really important raid position because both crowd control and dps can be done by many other classes<br>  Shamans can heal or dps, wear mail, dual weild weapons, lay down very helpful totems in battle, and be played in a veriety of ways. Each shaman spec is very different from the last. resto for healing which is one of, if not the most important key roles you can play no matter in raids or pvp. elemental is a spell casting spec and enhancement is a melee spec both with unique advantages and drawbacks. Even though shamans are good at healing, melee, and casting they are not really the best in either of the 3. Also a shaman must watch their totems and put more down every time they disappear or you move. A shaman can usually always find a position in a raid no matter their spec.<br>  While im not gonna tell you a certain class is better then another i am going to reccomend shaman over warlock just because of the wide range of play styles available in 1 character instead of a warlock where your stuck with being a dps caster or pvping. This is only my opinion though dont take my answer word for word this is only some information to get you started. play whatever class fits you and your playstyle better because a player who knows their toon well and their playstyle can defeat any other class in the game|`|kuFAx4ymaa	its a well balanced game...  depends on play style, what you like, what you want to do...  ect.<br>  <br>  But moreover, the game is dead imho.  I was an oldschool original player.  Hardcore raider, top guilds...  The game is dead.  Blizzard caters to the nub retard masses now.  They'll do anything to get another 15 bucks a month.|`|S5WsBJI4aa	well. <br>  Shamans- last very long and the totems are super helpful<br>  I prefer warlocks but----clothies are softies...lol|`|qTFhs4GVaa	Depends on if u want them for pvp or pve|`|YxJOD0HPaa	Simple Answer: Both.<br>  <br>  Long Answer: Both are very nice in their own special ways; Warlocks are going to always be a ranged DPS class and from what I've noticed in Wrath lately is that their actually is a lack of ranged DPS, and Warlocks have been always known for the Damage topping. <br>  <br>  Shamans are well, hybrids. As a melee class they are decent but not so much needed or helpful, they don't bring that much to a raid maybe some totems here and their and a little bit of DPS but nothing crazy. As a caster they are going up in need and they we're buffed recently so they are a creditable spec, besides they bring more helpful totems. As for healing they have been always needed and least played healing class, as data shows, they are a great raid utility class and excellent overall.  <br>  <br>  That's my two cents, Good luck on your choice and Happy Gaming!|`|1neMZoRLaa	depends really.what spec?
IfbkuHZfaa	Yes phantom is right on this one...While both look amazing, WaW is definitely the way to go. it has far greater replay value and i have yet to play a game that tops this one online. single player is great as well...End war was a disappointment for me because of the lack of action. you basically tell your squad what to do as you sit and watch. My reccomendation is to get WaW although if your into more strategic less action games then End War might be a game worth looking into|`|nHbDZCy7aa	End of War maybe better|`|Med7VQI7aa	World at War.<br>  <br>  It will give you FAR more replay value if you like playing online. It's very addicting too.|`|D4woInVAaa	To tell you End War sucks because you dont even fight in the game. You plan your attack for your army to fight for you is all. Trust me i had the game and it stunk on ice. Your better of with World at War, but Modern Warfare is way better no matter what.

D82ZyKsraa	Sorry, you can't. You can only move one counter at a time. <br>  <br>  As per 502.54b of MTG Rules ("Dissension"), it says:<br>  <br>  * Graft's triggered ability triggers each time a creature comes into play, regardless of who controls the new creature. A player may move a +1/+1 counter onto another player's creature this way.<br>  <br>  * When a creature comes into play, all graft abilities will trigger. The controllers of those abilities choose, one at a time as those abilities resolve, whether to move a counter. A creature that has just come into play may receive multiple +1/+1 counters this way.|`|iU7ZizxSaa	One counter per original Graft creature, per creature that is put into play.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have 3 creatures in play with the Graft ability, and play one more creature, you can move one counter from each of the three originally in play.  Rinse and repeat... in this case 'a counter' means a singular counter.  Sadly, just the one at a time.  Though in the example I mentioned, you could toss three counters on the new creature, one from each of the original Graft abilitied creatures.

rDr4ADIyaa	i work at toys r us in fremont and i can tell you those two were dumb dumbs. non-working merchandise illicits a return. You need to make the return within a week ( unless it is a gift, in any case, at my store, we ALWAYS ask you if its a gift and if you need a gift receipt ). After 7 days, you're telling us your model is ok. Anything after that, without you picking up our warranty, we can offer you nothing but an apology. ( if said person can do that after a week, whos to say there isn't that person whos gonna be using it for months and then return it when they think they've used it to exhaustion? ). My fruitcup cousin does that. He buys crap, returns it in 30 days after having his fill. then he goes somewhere else and does it again, if hes almost at the mark and he feels like he needs to get a couple more ounces out of it. Seriously, looking at him, i understand why things are this way.<br>  <br>  on top of that, whats up with you? Do people come to your work and call you stupid for not understanding or knowing how business run? Seriously, a lot of hired workers are kids who don't know any better. Relax, and don't leave. stay there as long as you need to. Get your money back. <br>  <br>  The last thing you should know is don't be a douche bag. If someone came up to me and called me stupid, i would show your *** the door, no matter if you made a purchase from my store or not. Seriously, we're not your freaking slaves. <br>  <br>  By the way, the policy with that 30 day you threw around, it goes like this. " merchandise ( non-electronics ) have 90 days for you to return the merchandise. items being returned must be unopened. For electronics, you have 45 days, unopened " <br>  <br>  that 30 day crap? thats for another store like walmart or best buys, dude. <br>  <br>  I'm mad you had the audacity to call another human being stupid. nice going, jerk. Way to ask for help.|`|mlAFvumUaa	complain to their head office,<br>  they'll probably give you a refund|`|275a76c3021b903d93c9b6d665b05088aa	First, did you have a receipt?  Without one I don't know of a store that will refund.  If you have a receipt, check what is written on it many stores have what the return policy is printed on them. And if you did start yelling and hollering, you are lucky they didn't call the police. Acting that way will never make things turn out the way you want.

Go door to door selling individual M&M's (or Post-It-Note pads, paper, grass samples, toothpaste, cereal-by-the-flake or gram, or anything else you think might be amusing).<br>  15. Pretend to have a split personality. Maybe even three. Talk to yourself. <br>  16. While riding a bus, everytime the bus driver applies the brake, yell, "We're going to crash! We're all going to die!" and duck in the fetal position under your seat. <br>  17. Jam miniature marshmallows up your nose and sneeze them out. See how many you can do at once. <br>  18.

Each set translates to a different prize, and there are also instant win pieces.  In Addition, each tear off game piece has a code on it that can be used online to earn a single "dice roll" on the online game board.<br>  <br>  So, if you have two of the same property, enter the code online at get your free "roll," and then pass the game piece on to someone else..or better yet...trade!

People don't give a crap when they work low paying jobs, and Britain is not a police state.<br>  <br>  For example, have you ever exceeded the speed limit in your car?  Were you automatically arrested?  Of course not.  Your brother may get away with placing a lot of bets and may not ever be caught.  But this doesn't mean he won't even be caught.<br>  <br>  The fact is, you were breaking the law by conducting this experiment.  You illegally coerced a child into under age gambling.  If he had been arrested, the odds are YOU would have been charged.  You wrote the bet, and encouraged him to do it.  As the 'responsible adult' you were supposed to know better.  So I'm not sure why you were so disappointed that you were not arrested.  Maybe you should call 999 and turn yourself in for corrupting a minor?|`|rSTNUGy3aa	Please stay away from bookies.

IdlaZQ8Jaa	I'm a dad, I say B.|`|mdfKV703aa	I lean toward B. Obviously care for your son if medical attention is needed, but this girl clearly felt that she did not want your son to do that, and therefore he got what he deserved,<br>  While the answer here about making your son apologize to everyone involved is probably the most moral, I don't think it's the most practical. I myself am a girl, and am 18. If this happened to me, now or 4 years ago, an apology from the boy would be fine. But I would be just as embarrassed if he had to apologize to my parents--that situation is ridiculously awkward. <br>  Honestly, he's probably been punished enough. He suffered the shame of rejection, humiliation and physical pain from this girl. I wouldn't push this too far--he's more than likely learned his lesson.|`|AA11289758	I think this is a great opportunity to teach him about the consequences of his actions, as well as inappropriate and appropriate ways to manage sexual thoughts.  No doubt your boy is not stupid, rather he made a bad choice in managing his curiosity and hormones.<br>  <br>  Certainly treat his injury with an ice pack, and instruct him to tell you if there is a lot of swelling or bruising that doesn't go away so you can get medical attention if he needs it.  Explain that you understand his curiosity, but that his actions were inexcusable, and he must apologize to the girl AND her parents for disrespecting ALL of them.<br>  <br>  Next, I suggest that you get the girl's name from him, and contact her parents.  Explain the situation as calmly as possible, compliment their daughter on her strength (she protected herself), and then march him over to their home or a neutral meeting place, and have him apologize to the girl and her parents, state that it will never happen again, and what he has learned from this experience. (After all, if you had a daughter and her bottom was grabbed, wouldn't you be upset, too?)  Your son should also apologize to this girl in front of whoever was there when her bottom was grabbed...no doubt she was embarassed by this<br>  <br>  If you so choose, you can have him volunteer some manual labor (yard work, etc) to the girl's family as punishment.<br>  <br>  Remind your son that you love him, are proud of him, that this doesn't make him a bad person, and that there are better ways to manage future curiosity.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

mC9bkM7laa	Each player chooses four pawns of one color and one player is selected to play first.<br>  Each player in turn draws one card from the stack and follows its instructions. To begin the game, all of a player's four pawns are restricted to Start; only a 1 or 2 card can release them to the rest of the board. Playing a 1 or a 2 places a pawn on the space directly outside of start; playing a 2 does not entitle the pawn to a second space (this is ambiguous on the 2007 Hasbro link instructions and the card instructions, but is explicit in the 1972 Sorry! game instructions).|`|PVR0y9eOaa	if you draw the 2 card, than yes you can move out, but ONLY one space. it says or because if you have no pawns (or whatever they're called) in your home place (i don't have a clue on what these are called) then you can move one of the ones on the board two spaces. that is why there is the Or<br>  hope i helped

mOTCr8Pxaa	The basics of ev training are each pokemon has 510 ev slots which are filled while battling pokemon. The most you can fill in one stat is 255. Certain pokemon give certain ev's. And ev's are only fully accounted if the total number given is divisible by 4. For instance a shinx gives one attack ev when you defeat it. If you give the pokemon your training macho brace it will give 2, pokerus works the same way. If your pokemon has pokerus and macho brace then you would get 4 ev's. If a pokemon is holding exp. share and does not partake in the battle it receives half the ev's that pokemon give although if it only gives one it's rounded up to one anyway. The power items add 4 ev's to a particular stat no matter what you battle and is affected by pokerus. Say your training in attack and you pokemon has pokerus. If you attach the power item that boosts attack if you take on that same shinx you will receive 10 ev's for attack. And if you switch the pokemon out because it is not at a high enough level to fend for itself it still gets the full amount of any example of whaty I have brought up.

Or with a box of toothpicks, a small eraser, and two small knives per team.<br>  <br>  Here's a great challenge, though it works best when the people all know each other more-or-less well.  Pick four people to somehow hold each other up off the floor except for their feet -- but no standing up!  The secret (which you may have to tell them after 20 minutes or so) is that each person's head rests on the belly of the next person, which is (and holds them) off the floor.  Legs are bent at the knees so that feet are on the floor.  It looks (birds-eye view) like four people are lying on the floor, heads on bellies all around a squared circle, but no one has any legs below the knees.  <br>  <br>  This doesn't work with less than four people, but you can add as many *more* people as you want.<br>  <br>  A similar game is to divide everyone up into teams of, say, 3 people each.  Give each team a list of what body parts they can have on the floor within a time limit, such as, "Two feet, three hands, and a head," or, "Three feet, a fore-arm, and a hand," or "One foot and four hands."  Have a bunch of little lists on stand-by, separated according to how many people are in each group.  If it's going well, make challenges progressively harder by lowering the number of body parts on the floor(no less than 3, though), or restricting the area they can use (mark with masking-tape squares on the floor).<br>  <br>  Of course, if it's not too corny, there are always old-fashioned county-fair-type contests --- egg-on-spoon races, three-legged races, etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|gXRz3U7Vaa	Apples to Apples is hilarious.<br>  i'm sixteen and i love it lol.<br>  <br>  and you can play with as many people as you want.|`|AA11682450	Twister!!! it might sound silly but it was the biggest hit at my partys...<br>  people geerally enjoy they get to be close to the opposite sex, esecially if they like someone else there!|`|dlJ5GpOraa	Spin the bottle, 7 minutes in heaven|`|vLD8L1P0aa	year, spin the boccle haha|`|htyH4MdWaa	spin the bottle!<br>  <br>  mixed with beer goggles, you cant go wrong|`|ATb5iWoXaa	Study comes first my dear!|`|PMRY3osxaa	I know it may seem a little childish, but HIDE N SEEK is always so much fun to play. you can go outside at night and play in the dark, so much fun, im a teenager too by the way. Also kick the can, sorta like hide n seek in the dark, but when the seeker trys to find everyone, your also trying to kick the can, hens the name. also sardines, where ONE person hides, and everyone else trys to find them, and if you find them, you must quietly hide with them, and the last person to find them hides in the next round. truth or dare/spin the bottle mix.<br>  a movie is fun too!|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	chinese whispers thats such a laugh at any age!<br>  <br>  <br>  Balloon popper<br>  Indoor<br>  Equipment: Chair, several balloons<br>  <br>  <br>  Someone sits on the chair with a balloon on their lap. The other people line up and one at a time they run and jump on to the lap of the seated person. The aim is to pop the balloon. If they fail, they have to keep bopping up and down until it pops. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Broom Twist<br>  Outdoor<br>  Equipment: Broom<br>  <br>  <br>  A teen party game with a spin! This game is a real wobbler and causes a huge amount of laughs. You need plenty of open space so is definitely a teen party game for outside. One kid takes the broom and holds it by the handle above his head and then turns round five or six times on the spot. Then whilst still holding the broom handle, he then immediately places the head of the broom on the ground and attempts to stand on it with both feet. It's much harder than you think! My dad played this and ended up in the hedge so be warned. <br>  <br>  <br>  -- Teen Party Game -- <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chinese mimes<br>  Indoor<br>  Equipment: None<br>  <br>  <br>  This is a miming version of Chinese whispers and great teen party game for a large group. The players are split into two teams. One team leaves the room whilst the other team thinks up an action. It could be anything from having a shower to changing a car tyre. Maybe keep it simple for the younger age group. One player from the second team, now renters the room and a player from the first team mimes the action. Next another member from the second team enters the room but this time his team mate has to mime the action. This continues until all of the second team is back in the room and the last player has to say what he thinks that the action or situation is. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chocolate Dice Game <br>  Indoor <br>  Equipment: 1 hat, 1 apron, 1 die, a plate with a bar of chocolate (the already marked in squares variety), 1 knife, forks for each player. <br>  <br>  <br>  Players sit in a circle with all items in the middle taking turns to roll the die. Once a 6 is thrown the player must quickly put on the hat and apron, take up the knife and fork and commence to cut and eat small pieces of chocolate but only using the fork. They are allowed to continue until another player throws a 6 and whereupon the eater must immediately stop, remove and pass all items to that player who in turn dresses up and starts to eat the chocolate. Tip: Players should predetermine the size the chocolate should be cut to when eating. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Do You Love Your Neighbour?<br>  <br>  <br>  Indoor<br>  Equipment: A chair for each player<br>  Everybody sits on a chair in a circle except for one person who stands in the middle. They then go up to someone and ask, "Do You love your neighbor?" The person who's asked the question either states 'Yes' in which case the two people sitting either side of him/her try to switch places but the person who asked the question must try to get one of the seats first. Alternatively the person who's asked the question can say "No" and then say something like, "but I do like everyone with blond hair" etc. Everyone who has the characteristic named, then has to run and switch places across the circle and the person in the middle tries to get a seat. The last one standing is the next person to ask questions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Egg Toss<br>  Outdoor<br>  Equipment: Eggs – lots!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Now this teen party game is definitely one for outdoors and only if you have lots of spare eggs – oh yes I always have a dozen spares hanging around the house, I hear you say! If you are feeling very brave and prepared for a lot of mess, use raw eggs. If not, I would definitely recommend boiling them first. Split the players into pairs and line each pair along two imaginary lines about one metre apart and so that the pairs are facing each other. Give each pair one egg. The aim of the game is to toss the egg to your opponent, which they then have to catch. If they do so, each person in the pair takes one step backwards. The egg is then tossed again and if successfully caught, another step backwards is taken ad so on. The winning pair is the one who manages to throw the egg the furthest without breaking it. There is a skill to this teen party game in that when catching the egg, you should move your hands in a backwards motion to reduce the force of the egg hitting the palm of your hand – much easier said than done! <br>  <br>  <br>  Follow the Leader<br>  Indoor<br>  Equipment: None<br>  <br>  <br>  A great ice breaker teen party game. One person is sent out of the room and the others select one person to the leader. The leader then starts performing a silly action like wiggling their tongue or scratching their nose of which everyone has to follow suit. At this point the other player is called back to the room. The other players continue the action until the leader switches to something else and then they too must immediately follow suit. The aim of the single player is to catch who is the leader. He only has two guesses. It's very funny to watch especially if the leader continually changes actions and the poor observer|`|swGDISfUaa	some of these are for guys and girls to play and some you can play woth anyone<br>  <br>  <br>  Suck And Blow<br>  Make everyone sit in a circle going male, female, etc. Get a playing card (normal sized) <br>  <br>  Put the card on your lips, the flat side not the edge, and suck in air so it sticks to your lips. Then pass to the person next to you. They have to suck the card onto their lips and pass to the next person. <br>  <br>  Continue the game around the whole circle. If you drop the card, you'll most likely kiss the person next to you. <br>  <br>  Go until you make 3 consecutive misses in a row. The last 2 people who drop it must do a forfeit. <br>  <br>  <br>  Bigger And Better<br>  This game is best when played by teenagers who do not mind carrying large items over some distance. <br>  <br>  Divide people at your party into groups of around four or five. Give each group something like a pencil, Crayola marker, or plastic cup. Instruct the groups to roam the neighborhood, knocking on doors, and asking the neighbors if they would trade something bigger and better for the pencil, marker or cup. <br>  <br>  Groups should continue to trade for an allotted amount of time when everyone will gather at the host's home to compare goods.<br>  <br>  My daughter and friends brought home a bicycle, a storm door, a couch, and an old set of golf clubs!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ping Pong Flick<br>  Get one bottle and one ping pong ball. Put the bottle on a chair so the top of the bottle is roughly waist high. Balance the ball on top of the bottle. <br>  <br>  Stand about 10 feet away from the bottle. Stretch your arm out with your first finger ready to flick the ball.<br>  <br>  Walk to the bottle keeping your arm stiff and try to flick the ball off the bottle with your first finger as you walk past. You are not allowed to slow down or stop as you get near the bottle or to bend your arm. <br>  <br>  "We tried last year with over 30 people and one person did it first time but it looks so easy when you demonstrate (after practicing in secret before hand) that every one thinks they can do it." <br>  <br>  <br>  Balloon Truth Or Dare<br>  A very different kind of truth or dare is to write your truth questions and dares on slips of paper. <br>  <br>  Now put the truths in green balloons and blow them up. Put dares in red balloons and blow them up. <br>  Write truth or dare on the outside of the balloons with a permanent marker. <br>  <br>  Get everyone to pop a balloon by sitting on it, then read the truth or dare out aloud and answer it or do it.<br>  <br>  Good for sleepovers and teen parties. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Egg Roulette<br>  A bit messy but a real laugh. <br>  <br>  Get enough eggs so there is one per player. Hard boil them all except one. About 15 minutes in boiling water will be plenty. Put all the eggs in a bowl, including the single egg you did not hard boil. <br>  <br>  Now start the game. Everyone picks an egg. You then have the choice of 'switching eggs' where you and someone else switch.<br>  <br>  Finally everyone smashes the egg against their forehead - with the inevitable laughter as one person gets a surprise! <br>  <br>  <br>  Spin The Secrets<br>  First you need to have a load of friends. Sit in a circle on the floor. Then you take a bottle and spin it in a circle. Whoever the nozzle lands on, they have to go into a nearby room or closet with the person who spun the bottle. The spinner must then tell the chosen person 1 deep dark secret. It is then the chosen person's turn. <br>  <br>  You then get little pieces of paper. You write the secrets on them and put them into a hat. Whichever secret you draw, you have to try to guess whose secret it is. If you guess correctly then you get to start the next game. <br>  <br>  <br>  Camera Game<br>  Find a point-and-shoot camera with a flash and a self-timer. The cheaper the better. Or you can use a digital camera. <br>  <br>  Set the self-timer and the game begins. Each player must hold the camera at arm's length and point it at themselves very briefly, before passing it on to their left.<br>  <br>  Keep going, until eventually the camera goes off with a flash of light, and much laughter. The loser has a quick forfeit (see our forfeits page), before recommencing. The shots you get back will be very amusing.<br>  <br>  Don't bank on your camera surviving the game for long! <br>  <br>  <br>  Laughing<br>  Everyone gets a cup of anonymous soda, juice or caffinated beverages. Make some taste bad (but edible), and some good. Do not make them poisonous, and water is not good for this game. <br>  <br>  Nobody should know what the drinks are. Everyone get given a drink.<br>  <br>  There is one person chosen to lead. They try to make the first person laugh. They have 20 seconds. The first person is drinking their assigned drink at the same time that the leader is trying to make them laugh. If any amount of the drink spills out of the glass, they are out! <br>  <br>  Usually they spit it out because they are laughing at the same time, or because they do not like the drink! <br>  <br>  The person who avoids spilling their drink wins.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jelly Baby Mountain<br>  A good game for making a mess. <br>  <br>  Get a big bowl and pack it full of flour.

This is the easiest way to play while lowering the house edge.  "Backing" you passline bet simply means an additional wager that is placed behind you passline chips.  This portion of your passline wager is paid at 'true' odds when you win and not simply even money.  The additional bet is also free of any house advantage!  Some casinos will allow you to 'back' your passline wager with 100x your initial bet, while others will only let you place a bet equal to 2 or 3X your passline wager.  Good luck, have fun, and don't risk the rent money!|`|M7G3MZb5aa	The pass/don't pass line have the best odds.<br>  <br>  The disadvantage i believe is 1.14%, it is negated by taking odds ofter a point has been established, but in reality, this si only so because the additional money you front "dilutes" the house edge exposure, in reality, taking odds on pass/don't pass bets, will have no change in the total dollar amount you lose, but rather the percentage of the total dollar amount you put into action, since by taking odds, you put more money into action.  It kinda hard to explain, but anyways, the short answer, is put you money on the pass don't pass line, and nothing else.<br>  <br>  You can also bet the come/don't come, and it is the same thing.  Taking odds on the bets wont cause you to win or lose anymore money on AVERAGE, so you can play ti as you wish, additional money placed as odds is a "free bet" with no house advantage.

8b7170e38a50a75423054d4df0120b1caa	I would suggest asking your parents or the person looking after you and your brother.  If they are not avaliable, look deep inside your heart and what do you feel and stick with it.  If you are uncomfortable with it, don't.  If you think your brother won't be scarred with the experience or has trouble separating reality, don't.<br>  <br>  I just don't want to assume your background or home enviroment.  You never know nowadays.|`|eFW5O92Yaa	Yes if he's mature enough to handle the stuff. I was watching R rated movies and M rated videogames when I was 6.|`|IIKwBSrxaa	What are you doing on Y!A when you're 10?  Log off before you come across a Men's Health question.  They aren't often pretty.|`|pY4n0Gmnaa	Yes it is, many kids play T and M games.  As long as the kid isnt easily freaked out and isnt immature there really isnt a problem.|`|8QRmftlqaa	yh it is i was playing 18 year old games when is was 10|`|DJoQnwNbaa	yes its ok for a 10 year old to have t rated games|`|MqJYhuQ3aa	I honestly don't see why not. As long as he's mature enough, it shouldn't be that big of a deal.|`|u3bxLdAXaa	It's fine. Some 10 year olds play "M" rated games. However it may depend on the game.<br>  <br>  The ESRB rating system is like the rating system for movies. They are a guideline to people, mainly parents, about what kind of content would be featured in the game and whether or not  children under a ccertain age should be playing it. <br>  <br>  A good site to determine if the game you plan on purchasing for someone is sutiable for their age is whattheyplay.com they review games and determine how old you really have to be to play this game.  For example a game could be rated "M"(mature: 18+) however the site would review it and determine that it's ok for those over 15 to play and why. <br>  <br>  If your a parent it's up to you wheither or not you think the game your kid(s) play is right for them. <br>  For example: If you think the game has to much violence then don't let them play it. Or if you think they can handle the violence and be mature about it, then let them play it. <br>  <br>  Again it up to you to do the research about the game and determine wheither or not you want your kid(s) playing that game.|`|oZqoxgc7aa	ESRB rating is a suggestion not a law or absolute ruling. It allows parents to make informed decisions before purchasing a game for a young child.<br>  There are games which earn an M rating for a bit of "iffy" language, but their parent may walk around cussing on all sides of the house. In that case, as long as the child is able to distinguish between real life and a videogame, it's fine. Better that than having 16 year olds playing "T" rated shoot'em'up games and the shooting up their high school.|`|bdK1Fr72aa	It depends, there are certain stuff that make up T-rated games like violence, bad words, and other stuff. It's ok if ur brother can handle some of those characteristics but there are others that may be a lil too inappropriate in quality.|`|USgWGqgAaa	Nope

M9FQSKRwaa	if you have great aim and perfect timing then id say that you can.|`|jNlccRxnaa	It may or may not be possible but you also have to think of how likely for it to happen, sure you could point the gun about 5 inches from the nickel but that might be a little dangerous considering its metal against metal.|`|wZlqxCTNaa	I think they showed this on Mythbusters, and they found that shooting a hole through a nickel tossed in the air was basically impossible, but a nickel mounted in a clamp with the gun perfectly aligned could do it.|`|d6fd3077bc1506ef3c2bb76a580cdb53aa	Silver dollar yes; nickel, highly unlikely as it is too light in weight.<br>  <br>  It ALSO depends on the weapon AND AMMUNITION used.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	I have never been present when it has been done, but some of the best shooters have witnesses verifying it has happened.|`|UebWhbD6aa	no it isn't possible to do that because it is hard
cc5e7b59d9f5b31a9270b1f6d1ac1b72aa	If the foam balls are supposed to be touching each other, then use a stiff wire and just push them through and then you can bend the wire to any shape you want or need.  A coat hanger might work also.  A hot glue gun would likely melt the foam.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Wooden dowels and white glue (like Elmer's). First poke the dowels into the foam, then remove it and squirt a SMALL amount of glue in the hole, then reinsert the dowel.|`|MqJYhuQ3aa	Try toothpicks.|`|YOeuA0Ivaa	Krazy Glue?
