20090307195038AAZURxN	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why do people always want to use my ipod?	ok. So whenever I am on my bus, I bring my ipod along to listen to, however, whenever I do, people are always asking to use it. I got my ipod touch around xmas, and the day I brought it, people were asking me, "do you have tap tap" or, "can I see it?". Finally, I just gave in and let them play. Eventually, they (my busmates) went into a habit of using my ipod touch. Now, I am getting really pissed with them because they are always asking, and I never get time with it. Now, I just listen to my ipod when they are not looking, and when the kids who want to use it get on the bus, I simply put it away. I am really getting sick of this situation when I know that they are perfectly capable of getting their own. My question is, why do they always want to use it and how can I stop them? I will give the best answer ten points:)

20090227102218AAIGwe2	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Home Theater HDMI to Digital Optical Out?	If I connect three HDMI devices to my Plasma TV, then use the TVs digital optical out to connect to the digital optical in of the A/V Receiver, will the receiver still decode the various digital surround formats that it supports for each of those three HDMI sources going into the TV?             Example:  If the standard Def DVD signal is going to the TV through the HDMI, then being sent back to the Receiver via the TVs Optical Digital Out, will the DVDs Dolby 5.1/DTS/DTS-EX/etc still be decoded properly by the A/V Receiver?            I normally connect each component's sound directly to the A/V Receiver, but in this case I only have (2) digital inputs on the Receiver and (3) sources I need to get digital sound from (CABLE BOX, DVD, PS3).           If this method would work, I could just leave the A/V Receiver set to the Digital Optical input all the time, and then whichever HDMI input was selected on the TV would be digital sound.           Thanks in advance for any help with this question.

20090307202702AAUrKMx	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Nikon Nikkor E-Series Lenses?	I've had a D60 for about a year now, and I'm just beginning to dip my feet into prime lenses.  I recently bought a 50mm from the E-Series on eBay, and I've found that the image quality, in my own experiences, puts the kit lens to shame.  The E-Series seem relatively inexpensive, and I hardly mind the fact that they will not AF with my camera, as I have gotten use to (and not bad at) manually focusing.        So, my question is- are the lenses of Nikon's E-Series worth their cheaper price for digital photography?  Would the more expensive D-Series lenses be better performers, in both optics and construction?        Thank you all, in advance.

20090307210456AAVhJnT	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Whenever I play a Wii game, it just pauses and I have to restart the whole Wii console.?	I was playing Animal Crossing on Wii a couple months ago, and in between when it is loading (with a bus and and an animation), it just kept going. I waited about 5 minutes (it usually takes only a couple seconds) and it never loaded completely. The only way to stop it was to reset the wii console, and I would lose any unsaved data too. When I played the game after that, sometimes it would freeze and other times it wouldn't. When I played another game, there is a short animation when the game is loading. It froze in the middle of the other game too, so I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with the Wii console. Do you know what is wrong or how to fix it?

I played the demo of it when I was around 10 or so, back in 1998, I think that's when it first came out. It was on the PlayStation. The best way I can describe the game was a Birds-eye-view shooter, where you take the role of a convict that is trying to break out of a maximum security prison, and you have to fight various enemies like guards, mounted auto-guns and other things I can't remember. There were different characters that you could choose and each of them had a unique weapon.

20090307214718AAUwZKx	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	IPod touch jailbroken and can't see anything.  Help?	Today I decided to try to jailbreak my 2nd gen iTouch that had firmware 2.2.  It worked successfully, but I had none of my old music and apps.  I was expecting this to happen.  When I plugged my ipod into itunes, itunes said that I could import my old files from "Owner's iPod" to my jailbroken one, so I tried to.        When I clicked okay, my iPod stopped working, and I couldn't restart it or see the home screen.  I can't power it down, or charge it.  I tried to go through the jailbreaking system again, but it failed at the last step.  It could recognize the iPod through itunes at that time, but it wouldn't let me restore because itunes had error 1601.  I tried re-installing itunes, but it didn't work afterward either.  All I can do now is put it in DFU mode, and iTunes won't even start up to let me attempt to restore it.      How can I reset my ipod under these conditions?  I know that it is unlikely that I can, but is there a way or do I need to get a new iPod?

20090307214839AA9832P	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	My iPod won't sync all the way and keeps needing to be restored - is it dead, or is this problem fixable?	I've been having a lot of trouble with my video iPod (30GB), and I was wondering if anybody could tell me if there's a way to fix it or if I just need a new iPod. Here's what's happening:      I plugged my iPod into my computer today to sync it with some new songs I'd put into my iTunes. Upon doing this, my iTunes said something like "iTunes cannot read the content of this iPod" and that I had to restore it to factory settings. I restored the iPod and then began syncing it again to get back all my old songs. This worked until about fifty songs in, when my iTunes seemed to get stuck on syncing the same song.    I then unplugged my iPod, which had only about the 50 songs I'd already synced on it, and then plugged it back into my computer in hopes that this would allow it to sync regularly again. It synced for another couple hundred songs until it got stuck on another song, except when I unplugged it for the second time, there were no more songs on my iPod anymore, even though I had already synced a few hundred. Upon plugging my iPod back into my computer, it once again told me that my iPod needed to be stored. I went through this cycle roughly four or five times before giving up. I have no idea why the iPod doesn't sync all the way and why it keeps needing to be restored before I can get all my songs on. Also, my iTunes on my computer keeps freezing and I've had to restart my computer three times already.      Is my iPod broken, or is this fixable? I've had the iPod for about three years and have dropped it many, many times, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's broken, but I really hope it's not because I don't have the money for a new one!   Please help me!

20080711154135AAuJomk	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	My PS3 HardDisk Broke. Now what?	My PS3 HardDisk Broke. They say to Format. But I can't even take it out. ( It's too tight in there )      What are the things I can do to fix it?       It's the thing where when you start it it says "File Systems corrupted about to restore files" Something like that.      Should I buy a New Harddrive? Or Buy a reader? I'm not totally sure what I should do. Anything under $110.    I won't bother calling Sony. They're Customer Support blows and they want me to pay $149 for something I didn't do to my PS3.    I been re-searching and this is starting to become a common problem with PS3's. It seems as if they don't last for long term.
