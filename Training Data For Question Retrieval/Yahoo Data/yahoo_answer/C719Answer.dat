18afBRSXaa	they arent your friends. Either that or they feel bad since you moved out on your parents like that. Try inviting them over and see whats up with them. I'm way younger than you but my advice works. I hope it turns out ok. Stay true to yourself!
uvt5W6roaa	i have a question-why are you still hanging out with these girls? pulling pranks, stealing money, and denying it later are NOT what real friends do. i think you should seriously reconsider the friendship. as for your friend who paid you back, i would remind her about the incident, and let them know they hurt your feelings. tell them that you would appreciate it if they apologized, and at the very LEAST give you half the money to pay back for another bra. if they don't apologize, talk to your parents about the situation, maybe they can help. i know it probably sounds a little dorky, but it is the only way to have them pay up. if they curse at you again later, they truly are not your friends, because if they were, they would handle this situation a little more maturely. if they do apologize, then you can forgive them, but keep an eye out for them-chances are they might do the same thing again.|`|18afBRSXaa	dont tell her to pay you back anymore. Get revenge. They arent your friends but i can tell you still want them to be. You keep convincing yourself that they will pay you back but it wont happen. I would know. Something like that happened to me too. I've been there. We all have.|`|mQOXJ519aa	That's awful! They aren't real friends at all, especially if that girl avoided you. I say don't ask them to pay you back, let it go because it just makes you look... like you care more about your bra. Quit being their friends. Find better friends who care about how you feel. Seems like they have more fun together than being with you. Good luck.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Are you out of your mind?  How can you still call this person your friend??       They were all    - more than one of them huh?    Don't you get it??  They are not your friends.  Forget the bra! Forget these mean mean people!      If you don't realize this now, you deserve everything that you get.      These are not your friends.  You are a joke.  You are a punching bag.  They laugh at you.  They pour stuff on you.  They are abusing you.      Keep at it and you'll have these mean malicious people all around you.  Next thing you know you'll be posting why all the guys slept with you and now won't call.    Wake up and smell the soy covered bra!!
Vh3v0aV4aa	People are changing constantly from the things they experience as they go about daily life. Especially at your age where your body is going through changes as well, you can't expect any person to act the same now as they did when they were a young child. Its good that you are focused on school now and I hope that you keep that up in the future.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	thats probably just because when you were younger, you didnt know what your priorities should be, you just wanted to play and have fun all of the time. most children arent on track all of the time when they're younger and thats okay. but thats good that your making good grades now, because thats when it matters.|`|qW4GVjROaa	Just goes to show you are growing up into a fine young person, good luck, keep it up|`|3iITqf6Uaa	You've grown out of that "I don't care" phase. Try not to dwell on who you were. Who you are now is what matters most.|`|71qGan9Raa	you were immature...things didn't matter to you.  You are growing up and are figuring out what is important to you.  Good job!|`|5yuZwOLQaa	It's hard to say but am glad to hear you turned the corner and are now responsible for yourself.  Good luck.|`|SmnWSJxIaa	Sometimes we go through our phases in life. It's a very good thing that you went through yours at an early age. Keep up the good work and continue to shine like the star you are!!|`|RmhKCM3Eaa	everybody just goes through stages of life and i guess yours was not caring about school|`|TOa38qzEaa	haha nerd
wc9viY4Saa	I would not buy her jewelry..You haven't hardly spoken to her. Get her anything that has to do with music (Mp3 player, gift certificate) or a gift certificate to a clothing store.|`|7yh14qqXaa	does she like stuffed animals?  you can get her that  or a CD of her favorite band/artist  or if you know her clothing style, that works out too   and like someone else mentioned, you can get jewelry  =]    [hope it all goes well!!!!]  :D|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	a gift certificate to a store that she likes....|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I am a big fan  of gift certificates.  I know some people say they are impersonal, but hey, you've stopped talking recently.  I'd get a gift certificate for your movie theatre, say about $20.  This should get 2 tickets to a movie + popcorn that she can use at any time or any movie.  If she goes to a matinee, she can get some candy too.  Who knows, maybe she might just invite you and you can renew the friendship you had going at the beginning of the year.|`|bJF3tGtfaa	You can't go wrong the jewelry. Doesn't have to be expensive, just pretty.|`|Az9keOz5aa	Maybe get her some jewlery,or a certificate of some kind and then tell her your glad you guys are friends.|`|7wumH6kDaa	i agree jewlery is the way to go but stay between $40 and $120. anywhere before and after those prices are the danger zone.
tI7QP3dkaa	He was 48 and I think that he put so much pressure on himself to be good it wouldn't happen.   If a man's head space is not right then it won't transfer to his dick.      I let him know that it wasn't a problem for me and set about giving him massages and making  him feel better.   A  lot of tenderness and caring helps in this situation.  Then turned the situation around so that he paid attention to me and making oral and touching a good experience for me so he could see that pleasuring me didn't need him to come|`|0RDsd7eYaa	Sometimes it happenes.  If it happens all the time, there could be something wrong.  I've never said anything to make him feel bad.  At the time he was 19.  I think he had problems because he self-pleasured a lot.  But he also never finished... to the point in claiming he had a good "one" without the mess.|`|cV3VV549aa	this happen to me, i slowly start to kiss my gf and massage her, after a few min's i started to relax and slowly got into the mood. i love the way my gf taste so that's all it takes to get me ready|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	I've never had that problem ;-)
eMtH8IAwaa	Does this guy flirt with you? If he does, then you can ask him to go to the movies, or for some coffee or something. Then, you may have the chance to get to know him better and test out how he feels. Maybe he is looking for a girlfriend and flirting a lot hoping one will choose him.     It does not sound like you know him well, so ask him questions, see what his interests are (music, movies, etc) and see if you guys overlap. If he flirts with you, then he is obviously interested in learning more about you.     You won't know anything until you test things out and talk with him some more. You don't have to tell him you like him until you hang out a bit and see if any connections are there. Just give it a try and see what happens!
INjM2aC4aa	I am, to the point were every guy that flirts annoys me. I just wish they had a different approach. I wish men were more sensitive and understanding. I've given up on finding Mr. Right.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	single i will remain|`|JQYuM4EDaa	O MY GOODNESS YES, i swore off guys and then like i ended up dating a d*ck a month later.|`|AA11830517	mmm. yea. im a dude and i feel the same way. maybe we're meant for eachother. lets start dating eachother..lol|`|5mIS49JXaa	i do have a bf and sumtimes i feel like jst doing a break off and be single coz u really get tired sumtimes...... lol.... but if u love a person...like me... that thought cums in mind for sometime...|`|78b2e62bdd7dbed986e0ac802a2e8b6caa	not really. im still young.:D|`|PJZRGsc3aa	i don't date really, i prefer to just go with the flow of life|`|ElQM7Z3Gaa	I love being free and able to casually date. Marriage is a commitment that sometimes you regret cause the freedom in your life is taken away right in front of your eyes. Im 20 and hope to NEVER EVER get married...but I'll probably change my mind. Good luck finding the right guy. NO EHARMONY OR MATCH.COM!|`|4yaZE0Rpaa	oh heck yea..   i am too..|`|fb6b13be35f7817303e37c725d73af37aa	I'm a guy and I don't date.  My doormat says "Go Away".  What's interesting is that I'm probably marriage and family raising material...my parents are still happily married...I have an excellent job...I'm responsible...etc...etc...
AA10984827	Father Daughter dance Tim Mcgraw My LIttle Girl  your first dance  Kelly Clarkson A moment like this|`|12ORrojXaa	i completely understand...we did not want the typical cheesy wedding songs....our first dance was to "everything changes" by staind...the bridal party danced to "into the mystic" by van morrison....and my dad picked out song, "what a wonderful world" by louie armstrong.  we had a dj and gave him a list of songs to play....we said absolutely NO 80s or 90s pop, line dances, and country music.....some of the artists he played included:  counting crows, staind, jack johnson, chevelle, ben harper, and some booty music (poppin my colla, etc)....anyway, it was a blast!    best wishes!|`|ul79DG2kaa	For my father daughter I wanted The Godfathers Waltz from The Godfather movie, we're Italian.  But my dad didn't know how to waltz.  I used What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.    A good first dance is Fly Me To The Moon by Frank Sinatra.  Nice and upbeat and will surprise people.  Or go for something fun like A Little Less Conversation by Elvis.  Really funky and cool.  If you want romantic At Last by Etta James was my last song of the night and it is really smooth and has alot of soul.  I was 26 when I got married in 2002 so I'm not some old person who is totally out of touch.|`|dBuc8c2Raa	For father/daughter, consider John Mayer's "Daughters."    For first dance, how about the Beatles' "Here, There, Everywhere" or Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "You've Really Got a Hold on Me."    Consider your favorite songs and songs that the crowd will relate to.  That way, there won't be a dry eye or in the house and everyone can recall their wedding day ;)    Congrats and good luck!|`|5e9d703e0fa8103d963b3e253d113cf7aa	Well for the song with your dad it can be dance with my father by luther van dross..but if u think thats common then you can have "sing me your song again"..this song has been covered a few times..u can find it on youtube..its really a nice song:-).."thans again" by ricky skaggs..one of my favourite is "turn around" by harry bellafonte..and as for the song with your husband..i would suggest "from this moment" by shania twain.i really want that song to be the song for my first dance on my wedding day..i found it to be the perfect song for me on my wedding day from the first time i heard it:-)..though i'm not married yet so i hope my hubby to be will agree on it..lol..well anyway yeah that jack johnson song is danceable.. in fact here is a vid fr youtube that a couple dancing to that song on their wedding day..u can check out..and if u still have a prob finding a perfect song to dance with your dad..this site can help you-http://www.wedalert.com/songs/fatherdaug... hope this helps..and congrats on the wedding!:-)
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You took a risk, and now it's up to her...if she wants to respond, she will...otherwise, you'll know where you stand...|`|Az9keOz5aa	Well,maybe try calling her,and then ask her to go out to dinner or something with you so you guys can talk,or just ask her how she is feeling and whats going on. You just need to give her some time,it may be a big thing to her and she just can't handle it.
DLS60sVBaa	Who do you like best? Go with that one when you decide. Yes, they probably like you (then again they may feel like that for many...) so it depends on the actions you take after you clarified your own situation.
fV9SawuPaa	Simple, they want in your pants. Most of the time when a guy sounds sweet and sincere he's actually full of sh*t.  These are the guys that make us REAL nice guys all look bad. We're a dying breed unfortunately. All I can say is if you find a so called sweet talker, don't give him ANYTHING for a long time. If he sticks around he is probably sincere.
zGKmgwofaa	He likes you. Honestly, most guys would love it if the girl would just be open about it. Tell him how you like him and ask how he feels, if he responds with a yes, then good for you. If he says no, then you're friends and he gets an ego boost. Either way, nothing bad comes out of it.|`|AA10315175	Well you never Know it can go both ways. Sometimes guys gives off an impression that they like you but just as a friend. And sometimes they just think you are a cool person to hang out and talk too. The only way you will Know if he tells you are you can just ask him.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Sounds like he likes you, and how can they call themselves your friends for treating another friend of yours like that?    I'd ask him out, he sounds like a nice bloke ;)|`|hgBSYQmBaa	gosh, poor guy, don't listen to your peers, they always have to find someone to pick on.  if you like the guy, and it sounds like he likes you, give him a chance.  looks are really not important in the end.  when you grow up, you begin to overlook looks and focus more on the important stuff like does he make you laugh, is he smart, do you enjoy his company etc..  just give him a chance!  he likes you.|`|ZdNhdeVYaa	it sounds like he likes u ;) well maybe if u r bold enough ask him how he feels about u and who cares about how hot he is!!! love him for the inside|`|45u3Ml46aa	i'm in about the same situation as you, but i didn't really tell my friends cuz i knkow wat they would say bout it. it's hard to tell and i'm srry but i can't help you there!  i wish i could have help with this one to|`|Shgt0zvraa	I don't think that appearance in this case should matter because if you liked him as well then screw the rest right?..And as for him liking you or not, I think you should just go ahead and ask him. It's always easier to go at it rather than picking around the bushes waiting..then running out of time and regretting. That's just my opinion.|`|Oafj48Zxaa	I'm thinking he just wants to be friends right now. At this point in his life, concerning his parents, he doesn't need a relationships right now or any added on stress. I suggest you just become very good friends with him, try to help him along the way. Seeing that he doesn't seem to be around during your break or at lunch probably just means he has other friends he wants to be with. Seems like you both have a rising friendship, and maybe letter on he might want something extra! Be careful and right now just be a good friend!
8XKmMBU7aa	hahah hahah hahah hahah hahah hahah hahaha hahah  Is he blind, handicaped, crack, stupid.   OMG Sorry for all if there is any problem in his mind.  You may go to any hospital and firstly Checkup needed.  I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|AA11706291	Help him find a job.|`|c04bc2109b0730dae9eaf736ac811ce7aa	I suppose it depends where he is from. However to say that he must be really worried about money. He probably feels like a failure for not having a job,not being able to look after his family etc.... Maybe you should do all you can to reassure him, and help him see that what is bad now may not be in anything up to 12 months time, Tell him you would rather stay here, he may find that really hard to take but, he will realise if he loves you he will stay with you. Tell him you understand all the issues involved. If say in 12 m,onths time there is no change then at least you will have had time to think about moving away.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	Not knowing what kind of work he does makes it a little tough.     IF there is a job service center near you he could look there, or he could do a job search on the internet.
racnq84Vaa	WhOA NEllie!  Slow down.  Why the rush?  Can't deal with being single?  I see issues deeper than the living arrangement.  Maybe you should take the time to examine your need to have a man around.  Any man who is chill with you and the man you bumped uglies with for three years being in the same box each night is not exactly after your heart.  I think he has bumping plans of his own.  And any man who wants a real relationship won't be chill with the situation.  So why not wait and get yourself together before dumping your mess on another's platter?|`|KwJDWvB3aa	tell him the truth...your ex is still living with you untill he finds a place.
rX8MkfBJaa	He really should not ever be in contact with her in any way other than a recorded interchange. she is a devil and will use anything to screw with him. Don't give her the time of day if not needed. Do everything by the book, and she will end up contempt of court if she doesn't comply.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	she's trying to pull a fast one. she should be happy she receives the checks on time. she is in no position to demand anything. have her go to court and they will see payments are made on time each and every month. she will look like the idiot that she is.|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	He lets her control him, (and you)!  Someone needs to put their foot down!|`|AA11706291	She probably wants to be able to claim that he never paid the child support in the first place, or she's on a power trip and is trying to get him to bend to her will.|`|FXCoGD44aa	I have no idea why she would suddenly prefer internet transfer. Unless she has had problems cashing the checks [[which she hasn't]] then I could understand. Maybe she needs funds immediately on the 1st... as if the 2nd wasn't soon enough? Or perhaps its just a power trip. Who knows.    But she has no grounds to threaten court action. As long as he is paying the correct amount on time to her, he isn't doing anything wrong. He can pay her with a bag of pennies and it still wouldn't matter.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	She probably wants to be able to claim that your husband never paid her the money. But it doesn't matter what she wants right now. Just make sure you have everything on your banking record. As long as it's not cash, everything else can be tracked. Checks, email transfers, wire transfers, anything but cash. Then you're safe.    edit: If you have a confirmation number, the bank can always track where the money's been deposited into. It doesn't matter where she claims the money is not, as long as you have prove that the money is for the child support and the bank can track where the money went. I'm in fraud detection at the bank. But if you don't feel comfortable with the transfer method then definitely don't use it.|`|gfHutvEFaa	doesn't matter if they each have the children exactly the same amount of time per month. He makes more. It's always been like that. I know it isn't fair, but it is what it is.    Sounds fishy. My suggestion to you: CALL HER BLUFF. What can she really do to him if he doesn't bend to her will?
2pq3y2ghaa	Sounds like your dad is a complete and utter bully!    I feel sorry for you and your family.. maybe you could talk to your mum about it?     If it's making her children upset then she should not allow this to happen.. maybe you should try and stand up for yourselves?    failing that... stab him! :)|`|ouRktxYTaa	Stay true to yourself...this is not your fault... your Dad is very sick.  Stay strong, it sounds as thought you are doing right for yourself despite your circumstance.   Learn from this and do not turn it inward.  There is a meeting group called Al-Anon that helps families of alcoholics, search them out in your area and perhaps they can help...if nothing else it will show you you are not alone.  Have a Very Happy Birthday!!!|`|nBQeSu2faa	You have done absolutely nothing wrong..you father has a drink problem..so when you are dealing with an alcoholic you are not dealing with a normal , reasonable, logical person...you are dealing with a drunk. Sadly Alcoholism can destroy a family...and causes great harm to the children. You should go to some meetings..Al-Non or Al teen ..I'm not quite sure what the names are..but any AA meeting will send you in the right direction if you ask or even phone them. You will find these meeting a great help and a great support.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	I think you and your mom and your brothers need to leave your dad. You can also stage an intervention to get your dad to stop drinking. I'm sorry this is happening to you.|`|AA10531094	No, it's not normal.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  You did nothing to deserve that kind of treatment.  Your dad's fighting demons and thinks he can hide in a bottle.  I grew up with an alcoholic father too. . . and he pretty much acted the same but 3 times worse.  Hang in there and before you know it you'll be out of the house.  Your mom needs to step up and take control of things.  Good Luck!|`|3UXlFfokaa	You didnt do anything to deserve it. I know exactly how you feel. One day things will change I promise. My mom was very mean to me like he is to you, and she started going to AA meetings and many other types of meetings (there are meetings for everything!). Ask to go to one for you and him. Please try even if he says know, atleast you tried. If the alcholism gets worse, you may need to resort to a higher power to get him help. Alcholism is a disease, and although people will remain alcholics, they can become clean.|`|Run7dyraaa	YOU didn't do ANYTHING to deserve this. Sweetheart, your dad is sick. He has a disease. It is called "alcoholism". He needs help. A lot of help. He should be in a rehab/hospital. You need to understand that ANYTHING that comes out of his mouth when he is drunk cannot be taken seriously. When he says "I don't like any of you mother _ _ _ _ _ _ _", he is actually saying (and trust me on this) that he doesn't like HIMSELF.  Trust me, I have lived this. I was married to an abusive alcoholic. Just like your dad, if not worse.  Listen to me, and LISTEN GOOD. The first thing you need to realize, AND NEVER FORGET THIS. He doesn't hate you. He hates himself. Honey, how could he like himself?  It has NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING to do with you. You just happen to be there, so you catch the nasty words flying around. Those nasty words come from his pain. His emotional pain inside that he is so frustrated with, he lashes out. Who does he lash out at? Probably the people who he loves and needs the most - you and your mom.  It's like dealing with (talking to) a brick wall. When you told your dad you were going to your friends house, you  may have well been talking to your dog. Your dad's brain is fogged, clouded, by alcohol. He is not capable of dealing with you, himself, his job, his responsibilities, as a normal father,husband. HE IS ILL.  You need to get your mom into therapy, or talk to her about getting help at Al-Anon. (Families of alcoholics). You need to detatch from your father.  This doesn't mean you don't love him. It means you need to separate yourself from him emotionally.  If he wants to beat himself up, let him. But don't you let him beat you up. I don't mean physically. I mean emotionally. Yes, you get straight A's, and darling, how wonderful that is. You deserve a lot of credit for that. Let me give it to you. You deserve a pat on the back and a big hug. You sound like you will be ok in life.  Talk to a teacher you can trust. You are a minor. It is possible the authorities could intervene and remove you from a dysfunctional, and potentially dangerous household. Where is your mother when all of this is going on? I left my marriage. I took my two children, and just left. With $8 in my pocket. And, I never went back.  Now my kids are grown up, and doing well. Your mom can do the same. And you can do the same. Talk to an adult you can trust. Be strong. And remember, it's not your fault. God Bless You honey.|`|DQkDQraOaa	You DON'T deserve that. This is your dad's problem and his doing. Keep up the good work in school, get your education, and then get the heck out of there asap. Good luck.|`|vxJxExCJaa	YOU should pray to God about this problem because he is the only One that can get you out of this|`|R1Kr0lqBaa	you didn't do anything. stop thinking that you did.  like you said your dad is an asshole and your family deserves a lot better.  why don't you talk to your mom. he needs to go to rehab and quick.|`|AA10941788	Wow!!!|`|VZOisk2saa	Im sorry that you are going through this  your right this isnt normal  whatever normal is  here is a place  you can look and see if there is any meetings in your area http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/english.h...
HI59AgTwaa	GET THE **** OUT OF THERE NOW!!!!!  seriously, do you not watch Oprah?  this is seriously not good.  if you get out now, you will look back in ten years and be relieved you did.    really, it is extremely important you get out of this relationship.  it can only get worse...  i feel horrible that this is happening to you.  you need to get out or get help, now.|`|p9CEObPeaa	i beg of you please report him thats definately wrong abuse it tragic in any circumstance but for him to hurt you when you pregnant to not right at all dont let you baby be born into an abusive environment|`|gA6vd4wgaa	You have to get out of this relationship!! He may apologize, say it won't happen again - He may make promises that he will not keep, he may make you feel like it's your fault for him losing control. Things are only going to get WORSE, and if you want what is best for you and your baby you have to get out of this relationship. You cannot let your child become apart of this.     It may be hard because you love him, but you have to think about what's best. If he is beating you, there's a good chance he may beat your child as well.|`|QjqZx6eoaa	i mean yes sumtimes but not 2 the point where hes beating on u an especially wen ur pregnant i think u should leave him alone child support should do jus fine|`|7THgBSvfaa	Leave him.. When the baby is born.. Take him to court so you can get child support.. Then move on and forget he ever existed.. Your child does not need to grow up with an abusive father and you don't need an abusive boyfriend..|`|hgi7ohCZaa	Exactly what the first answer (Kay Kay 10) said.  Leave him.  You will hopefully find someone who can help you raise the baby and build an amazing family together with.  No need for that kind of abuse and anger.|`|l1jQsK4Iaa	you should tell someone about what happened. the police can arrest him. love does hurt. it hurts the heart. but for you its more serious. usually once they beat you they do it again O_o  but if you love him then i guess you can stick with him longer especially if you are pregnant/ and or have a child but you wouldn't want an abusive father
JQYuM4EDaa	make an awkward silence for just a minute in a conversation and then just lean in and kiss her lightly|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	just kiss her  just a little peck, see how she reacts|`|VFQyC7Vlaa	Best advice I can give to you is if she isn't willing to make then first move, then you make it. Hug her, and while you are hugging, pull your head back and approach her lips. Meet her about 3/4 of the way and if she meets you the rest of the way then she definitely wants that kiss.|`|bJF3tGtfaa	You're the guy, you need to go for it!|`|tV7HOtp5aa	message... romantic movie... get her drunk....tell her shes beautiful then lean in|`|5nQjGlkVaa	make the move...|`|zByRUbsaaa	simple answer just lean in and kiss her the worst she can do is probably slap you|`|hLKTxQDXaa	just kiss her.|`|xR3F2RFnaa	sit wit her on a comfy couch. dim the lights. lean in and stare her straight in the eyes and tell her how beutiful she is. then shell fall 4 it and kiss u. lol i would know im a 13 yr old girl.lol|`|eCvm71URaa	i would say just kiss her at the right moment. like if the two of you are sitting on a bench together maybe not in front of a lot of people. just try it. although 13 is kinda young lol
racnq84Vaa	Break up with the new guy because you obviously are not being fair or right with him and he deserves better.  Get some psychological help.

3K1QW7Oeaa	You know what! Try visiting my mother's daycare!    There's a kid in her daycare that drives the staff crazy because he LOVES to cry (it's his passion.) He'll even cry just for the heck of it!    Suck it up! I agree with everybody who said "you are so overreacting." Maybe now you'll think twice before doing the nasty in the bedroom now!

c5501d7af062f728e28883d70bec4816aa	i can understand. and i cant really tell you what you are doing wrong. all i can say i understand. maybe you should find one guy you like a lot and chase after him. because that is the safest way to get a boyfriend. give him lots of attention and he will notice and like you. to get a little boost for your self confidence just go out to town and smile at some random guys and they will smile back. it'll be fun and you will feel more confident (which is one of the things guys like in girls). also ask some of your male friends if they think you are date-able or what they think you should improve and then ask if they have any nice friends ;)  gd luck  answer mine please  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|Ksilu2Zyaa	no one can answer this until u upload a pic ...that's the way it is.....wait do u go to the sixth grade cause if so DONTupload anything and dont worry there is PLENTY of time for guy to go after u later|`|AA11177214	It is one of those things, where the more you notice the lack of something, the more it sticks to you.

It could all be about the signals you are giving off. It is probably not connected in any way to looks. Yes, some girls are more successful because they look great. But, a lot of plainer girls do better than the prettier ones. How? Because they do not scare guys away with an unavailable attitude. Besides, you have got years and years to meet plenty of guys so don't go feeling like some freak at your age. Buy a book or go online and read up on flirting tips and body language for girls. It's ALL in the signals you are giving off. Good luck. You will win in the end.|`|rh12tX8Naa	You haven't met the right guy. Just be patient. You have the rest of your life ahead.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	o, i know how you feel!!! but, sometimes... IF there is nothing for you to improve on then you got to accept the fact and move on. but, maybe you could be more flirty and more forward w/ the guys. i mean, maybe if you dont want to have sex this could also be a reason. which means guys would only want you for your body and this isnt good either... i hope i helped and i hope you find the answer your looking for! good luck. and you are who you are!!! your awesome....|`|fYAjV0GGaa	You're only young. You've probably stayed with the same people for the past five and a half years, maybe longer. Go to parties and meet friends of friends. And friends of friends of friends.

It's awful to watch your friends date and feel like you are alone.    It doesn't mean that nobody is interested in you. Some guys are shy. Some aren't ready to date yet.    My first few boyfriends were all guys that I asked out. They were too shy to ask me.    I hope it goes well for you and things improve.|`|xgz60izBaa	I don't know how old a person in sixth form is but from the sounds of it, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Its better to wait until you are in your late teens or early 20s anyway before dating because guys are so immature when they are teenagers, wanting only sex and lying to you to get what they want.  Just wait and you'll have the guys interested soon enough.|`|HV4gMttlaa	hey i know how you feel,  You just have to wait,love is a waiting game  If you wait untill the right person comes along you will have a better relasionship.Dont let anything rush you into finding a bf/gf,  There is probebley nothing wrong with you maybe the guys are too shy to ask you out because they dont want to risk loosing their friendship.|`|H8tXHWRsaa	Have you ever asked your best mate how to get a bf.

wpi36XBAaa	What about those horror stories about those husband who insist on keeping control of all the money (even what she brings in) and doles it out so stingily to her and the household needs, but can spend freely on his wants, his toys, his hobbies? Or the ones who insists she pays all the expenses (even if she earns less) while his money is "his money"? Or the "man in control" who's personal problems make him irresponsible with the money? Or the man who clears out the account just as he takes off? That happens too.   If you have a girlfriend have separate accounts.   If you are married I think there should be three accounts - yours, mine and ours. "Ours" pays all the household bills and for food,etc. "Yours" and "mine" pays for those things that are personal wants, or can be saved by the person for whatever they want.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I would NEVER get a joint account with someone I was only dating, or even engaged to. To refuse one with your spouse though is wrong. I too know guys who's wives cleaned out their accounts, to them I say maybe you shouldn't marry a psycho. If my husband and I didn't have a joint account life wouldn't be easy, I woudn't be able to pay bills, wouldn't be able to buy groceries or anything else.|`|WgruZkHRaa	You can have a joint account, but get a separate one too, with password protection. Only put what is needed for expenses in joint account. If you make the mortgage payment, pay it with your private account. Use your head not your heart for financial matters.|`|UspK4SQBaa	There is absolutely no reason to share an account with a girlfriend, unless she is your business partner as well.  As for your wife, you should have three accounts- one for you, one for her, and one joint account for house expenses.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Somehow I doubt that this is a legitimate concern for you. I'm sure you're alone.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Separate accounts are a MUST if not married.  When you get married, you can have a "joint" account with a controlled amount of money - the situations you mention happen every day and the guys never get a penny back in most cases.  It is outright theft but the courts treat it as a civil matter like you said.      My wife and I have totally combined everything from day 1 - but after 20 years I would bet my life - not exaggerating - that no matter what ever happened between us she would never steal from me.  If anything ever happened to her (God forbid!!!) I would be way, way careful with future girlfriends.|`|8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	I think that it is perfectly normal to have separate bank accounts for reasons other than what you have presented. If a male or female moves into the others home the rules should be laid out prior to the cohabitation not as you go.     Who will pay for the rent/mortgage, food, clothing. Who will pay for vacations, medical...    Who will stay in the home, who will end up for the furniture and who will pay their have to own it.     This is call a pre-nup and it works for cohabitation too.     The other thing about separate checking accounts is the freedom to make purchases and not have to wonder if there is money in the account.    With cohabiting being the most popular way of living and so many relationships built on thin ice you may want to consider a pre-nup, just in case of global warming.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	no|`|EsnFmcMFaa	no its not bad    see to solve this problem you should have your own bank accounts and when you get married then get a joint account    so you will have three accounts in total|`|aGOBuJtKaa	My husband and I have a joint credit union account, and a seperate account for ourselves. The joint serves the purpose of paying household bills.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	No, it's not bad. My husband and I both have our own checking accts as well as a joint checking account. The only one we use is joint because I'm a stay at home mom so he's the money maker. The other accounts don't even really have money in them anymore. I'm the one who gets the bills paid and knows exactly what's in there. It all depends on the relationship, I guess. I'd never ever suggest a boyfriend and girlfriend get a joint account. But it's not bad to be married and want your own separate ones. There is nothing wrong with that.|`|AA10894901	You could open a limited joint account to cover your expenses only.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Yes & No  Its good to keep a joint family account if your married. As long as you keep your personal as well. Money each month can be transferred from your personal account automatically into the joint.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	,I have a bank account jointly with my husband that we call"housekeeping" He deposits my housekeeping money at the beginning of every month.  We both have our own private bank accounts that we manage independently|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Its very smart to keep separate bank accounts, even if you love the other person with all your heart and trust them completely.|`|HTaXKeHaaa	Its not a bad idea, if both of you have equal power and dont cheat lol|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	I do not think they are a good idea at all, just b/c of the examples you gave|`|Ss7nVdr2aa	I think with a girlfriend it might be a bad idea. But if your wife wants to open a joint account, that should be okay. You shouldn't marry him/her if you can't trust them.|`|4fKk6t6maa	Don't ever get a joint bank account with a girlfriend or boyfriend. Not a good idea at all.     A wife or husband is different though. I think it's a good idea to get a joint account, it's part of the whole "meshing two lives into one" idea which is what marriage is supposed to be about. Of course, if you don't trust your spouse to be financially responsible... maybe you need to sit down with her and have a talk about that.|`|7W34uvyyaa	No, I always say keep the money separate.  That way when some day they leave you they won't be able to take every penny you have when they go.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	My son and his ex-wife went through that. She never worked and one day while he was working she left him and took all the money in their account. She left him nothing. I told before hand not to put her name on the account because she did not work and she would take the money if she left. He said she would never do that to him because she loved him. (They were saving to buy a house). Or should I say he was saving? Anyway, like I told my son. Have your own account. That way if the relationship ends she can't take your money. Also, if you have your own furniture, take pictures and add them on your renters insurance, in YOUR name only! That is if you rent. That way too, if she takes anything from you, you can sue her.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I've heard every story in the book about women taking all the guys' money and belongings.  As my husband is in the military and those stories fly like around like you wouldn't believe.       As a faithful wife who would never take all the money, those stories have nothing to do with my marriage.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	No, it is not necessarily bad. I think it helps prevent arguments over money.|`|e5ec786ff8b2ba4d23a8bc87faee6379aa	No i don't think its a bad thing. But to keep the piece have one open in both your names and have a seperate one for yourslef just incase. I do. And it works out great. Plus don't let them know that you do or they will have a uproar about that too.|`|cDubFtwlaa	no no1 wants to be hassled about taking a large sum of money from the bank and questioned whats it for|`|zHwlGhIAaa	my husband and I have had a joint account since we were dating.  I was in graduate school and he was working.  I only used a few dollars here and there if I really needed it.  We have never had any problems with it and it has been four years.  I would never marry someone and sleep beside them every night if I can't trust them with money.  If I need a separate account, we need to live separate lives.  But since my husband and I believe that marriage is about becoming one in all ways, we put all of our money into one account and we consult one another on major purchases and it hasworked perfectly.
Oif6WjA6aa	if  my g/f broke up with me i would be sitting in the darkest corner of the earth drinking whisky till i couldnt anymore.      i think you should be supportive to him, he clearly misses you, an needs someone by his side so he doesnt fall apart or do anything stupid.|`|xZOHlSXsaa	It's natural for him to feel bad when you've told him you need a break.    Similar things are probably going through his mind such as "did I mess up", "will we ever get back together again", "what went wrong?".    In the end, the decision is yours whether to get back together with him or not but just a word of warning - if you don't and you wait for a long time before you consider it, he may already be taken when you return. It's probably best to make your mind up reasonably soon.    If you still like him and things aren't that awkward then try and keep talking to him. Make him feel happier but if you don't want to then make sure he knows it's over.    In the end, it's your decision. Work out why you need to take this break and act on your instincts.    Hope this helps =)

If he purchased the house after you married you could be entitled to a share. I dont think he can just throw you out but get legal advise asap.|`|osUlXcOOaa	Of course she has rights. Even though he pays the mortgage, when the two married  they became a joined unit which means that they both have rights on the marital home. If she has become violent or is a threat to the husband things may be different but he cannot just throw her out onto the street. See a solicitor and get proper legal advice and if she cannot afford it then see a solicitor at the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB). Good luck.
AA10529674	I don't think there is a way to ask him without him getting offended. My grandmother smoked before she died and if I wanted to spend time with her I had to put up with it because she would get angry any time I mentioned how I felt about it.|`|FKf67HXaaa	you cant. and if you try to controll him he is going to get fed up with it. you could ask him not to smoke around you and chew gum or something when he is done. It is kinda selfish on your part unless it effects your health.|`|rh12tX8Naa	You can't make him stop. He has to want to stop. Tell him that you want him to quit. Did he smoke before you guys dated? If so, why did you start dating him if you knew he smokes.|`|4PKuVsSzaa	ask him to stop if he loves you say you will help him :)|`|kg3wV0Czaa	Just tell him that you want him to be healthy and you couldn't imagine what you would do if something happened to him.  Ask him to talk to his doctor about it; his doctor can give him alternatives. There are some medications out there that you can take and it makes it so that you don't want to smoke anymore. If your boyfriend is afraid of quitting because he's afraid of the cravings, then that would be a good option for him.  I hope this helps!|`|VERrlErvaa	There is no "nice" way to tell him.  If he loves you, he'll stop when you ask him.  If he doesn't - then ditch him and find someone who actually has some respect for you and the people around you.    Smoking is a dirty habit that leads to cancer and grief - and it's economically draining.    If he is not willing to go get some help using a QUIT programme or nicotine patches, then he simply isn't worth the time of day.    So many people out there just allow their partners to do whatever they want and disrespect them.  Don't be one of those.

Wake up and smell the flowers, if he denied you than he's an asshole. **** him.Theres something, to think hard about. Who needs an asshole guy around. He must of just moved on, if it was that long ago.|`|6dHIoJLVaa	myspace is a pretty bad judge of character and intentions.  Does your profile clearly show that it's you?  Or is it all pimped out and named "water is only as still as your heart" or something rediculous like that?  If it clearly shows that it is you and he denied it, he probably doesn't like you or want to be close to you, but again, myspace is a bad judge of character and intentions.

Maybe she's just trying to keep you from making any mistakes. The last thing she wants is to see you hurt or lost. Explain he feelings and let her so the same, and your dad if you want to.

It's quite childish and unrealistic to hope that you can "hang out with your friends all the time." Eventually, you probably will start neglecting your school work and your attention will be more focused on your social life. Trust me. I've seen it happen to many bright, young students. Please tell your mother that you are going to balance work and play in your life, and more than likely, she will allow you to pass time with your companions.
5Wr9Mlwoaa	If a man doesn't take a shower or wash, the penis will become cancerous and fall off.    That is what is known as being "scared straight".|`|AYfJWQuTaa	I believe this isn't so rare & could be something to do with depression.  Or:  Try spilling something on him that will need showering off, tell him you will do it every so often until he gets the message.  Shame him in company with others by mentioning it! what have you to lose but the smell?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	1 shower in three months that's disgusting and uncalled for.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	holy cow..... he must be depressed, get him a doctor.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Just Photoshop one rotting off and scare him. Have you considered that he might be depressed? You could make a drs. appt. and lie to him about it. Tell him you're taking him to lunch.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	That is disgusting...why do you need a photo? You sound like a perv.|`|8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	Well, if he is not depress or loosing his mind, you can have him wash the car and when he is not looking throw the soap on him. Or, when you are gardening you can call him out and rinse him with the hose. And, there is my favorite you can put stuff animals all around him with RIP signs and say even the stuff animals can live around his B.O.     Joking aside, is he ill? Because that surely is a sign of depression.|`|9BXhgKFcaa	LOL...ewwww....sleep in diff room|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	how do u put up with that dirty man ... he be out my door . while you worry about his penis ,, is hole body stink...|`|5A7RmIH6aa	thats disgusting....and you sleep with that/ and kiss??  ewwww.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Your SICK|`|i3PGjRRfaa	He probably has a bet going with the guys at work on who can go the longest without showering and still have 'relations' with their wife..............    It is YOUR job to make sure he wins the bet.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	You can convince him by telling him you will give him oral everyday he showers.|`|1fFn1UhEaa	First of all thats disgusting....      Second just tell him that you wont sleep with him, ever have sex with him and if he continues the best thing would just be divorce.    Keeps it simple and straight to the point|`|Qnswjc6kaa	No sex. Clears that problem right up!    Why do you want pictures of a dirty penis? Sounds like your husband already has one!|`|Awywcn2Caa	Gross! I think that would be grounds for divorce!|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	OMG if you're serious, squirt him down with dish soap and turn the hose on him, at least you might get the first layer or two of filth off of him|`|b6LcC0CEaa	I wouldn't be so worried about his penis.. I would be more worried that you're letting an unwashed butt sit on your couch. I hope you have Febreze.|`|UNLrYNeUaa	he will agree to shower if you agree to lather him up and wash him|`|nEjeAUmqaa	y u need a photo of that when u have it all right in front of u..that is foul and disgusting..how can u sleep with that thing..ewwwwwwwwww..sorry but i wouldn't even touch him with a 100 ft pole let alone let him st on my couch..he needs a physiologist..      add--if u want to scare him into taking a shower then look up what skin eating diseases will do because he can obviously contract anything from not showering in months..oh and BTW i wasnt tring to mean i just think that is totally nasty.also this is a form of depression, maybe he wasnt at all ready for marriage if this is when ih desided to quite showering..u need to figure out what is wrong and then figure out where to go from there..
o6xLWwZvaa	You should only feel being used if you do not love him or the children. If you truly loved him and the children like they were your own, then being there for the kids shouldn't bother you. Because in reality of it all, you are like a mother to them.     Now if it bothers you, find a job. Once you start working he has to get a babysitter for the kids. Or, why don't you move out. Don't live with him. You are making it easy for him while living there. He pretty much sees you as a mother figure to watch the kids. If you don't want that lifestyle, then you should have never moved in with him.|`|AA12057913	u have to love yourself first n foremost - if this is not the life u want u have the right to get your self a life!! be bold be strong say what you want do what u want! good luck|`|qwveESAFaa	He's using you, and you are letting him.  Move out.  And then see if he is still interested.  He probably won't be.  You are a young educated women with so much ahead of you.  Don't get bogged down now.  His kids are his responsibility, not yours.   Take a clean break and then concentrate on getting to know yourself, your own wants and needs, as the adult you now are.  And if you find another man, don't move in!  Be a big bold women who can support yourself.  You can do it.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You're getting good advice from others, but I want to tell you that all that yelling is making things worse. Get a job. His kids, his problem. Watch him solve it when you aren't available anymore.|`|8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	It sounds like you need each other he has an income and you don't, but you do have a roof over your head and maybe some meals.    As for the 12 y.o and 5 y.o if you don't think you have a job you are wrong, yes you are his babysitter, but didn't you know he had kids when you moved in?    You are under no obligation to raise his children, in the same respect he is under no obligation to feed you.    You can either move out or learn how to be a Manager call yourself a Nanny, put your day in order, (I am not crazy) if at all possible get two or three more kids. Apply for a state Daycare license and Volie! you are a business owner and you can write off his two kids as expenses. I believe the ages of his children will allow you to have up to 10 kids and there are all kinds of free and low cost supplies for you to start this business.     "Have lemons?  Make a lemon Martini"|`|tOdjjeAmaa	You aren't married to him. Leave if you don't like the way things are. Why would you keep a relationship that will obviously not change? He's not going to get rid of the kids for you. So either deal with it or leave.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	you need to go|`|cdQryr7paa	You think he is taking advantage of you?  Who pays the rent / morgage?  Who pays the bills?  Who buys the groceries?  It seems to me because of him you have a place to live, food to eat, and get to sleep indoors.  I know you are looking for a job, but you are getting a few benifets from this living arrangements as well.  The 12 year old is pretty self sufficient, so the 5 year old is the one that needs the most attention from you.  Where is your relationship with him going?  Are you looking for a long term relationship with him?   Marriage?  Like it or not, if you are thinking long term with him, the kids are part of the package.  Or,  Are you just with him so you have a place to live until you get a job, then move out?  If that is the case, then you are taking just as much advantage of him, as he is of you.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	So, if you don't work, don't want to take on household duties, what WOULD be your job? If you can not find work right now, this is your job. If you didn't want kids or kids that old, you shouldn't be witha  guy that old. His kids are a package deal. If I was him, I think I would see you as the one who is benefitting, after all, he is supporting you!|`|LfoH1ivlaa	GET OUT!
wpi36XBAaa	Yes, it doesn't make him any less the father just because she married someone else.   However if her husband were to want to adopt the child and he agrees, then that would absolve him of the need to pay child support, but also remove any rights for visitation to that child, and of any say in what happens to the child from that point.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Yes of course he would.|`|Leda2ha0aa	Yes, he will have to support that child until they turn 18.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	He is legally responsible for child support until the child reaches the age of 18.|`|aXYiOskmaa	well of course. it's still his child.  if the step dad adopts the little tyke, then he is responsible for her care.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Yes.  The remarriage of the mother does not in any way remove the rights or responsibilities of the father.  Unless the step-father is willing to adopt the child and the mother and father are willing to let him.|`|zNjACkxpaa	he has to pay support until the child is grown or if new husband wants to adopt the child and he is willing to relinquish parental rights completely     Condoms are best|`|AN9PdKmgaa	of course|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Yes.  Some other guy shouldn't have to support the guy's kid.  Once you are a parent, you're one forever.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Yes, the child is still his.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Just because she married someone else doesnt mean that the child is now the stepfathers responsiblity. It is still your child and always will be. I always wonder how men think. If my daughter were living with her father, I would be happy to send as much as I could to contribute to her care. The only way to get out of child support is to give up your parental rights and find someone else to adopt your child. This means that you will never have a say in what happens in her life or have a right to visitation. New York state will not allow this to happen without someone else willing to adopt the child because too many women would do this so they could go on welfare and still live with their baby's daddy. Be responsible and do the right thing. Good luck!|`|aGOBuJtKaa	If he gets married to the girlfriend he got pregnant then no, if he marries someone else, the child support payments will continue.|`|GHd84xipaa	yes he does.it's his child and if he is any kind of a man he would pay child support until the child is 18 y/o.now if you are wealthy and you decide that you don't want him to paid any more,then you would need to go to court and have him relief of his responsibility.this would have to be done by the court and you can have visitation changes done at that time also.|`|RAGAcJV7aa	yes he does until the child is 18 or unless the new husband adopts the child then he is free and clear|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Yes.  He still has to provide for his kids.|`|TWNh6Dooaa	Absolutely yes. Especially if she remains on welfare benefits, you're not escaping responsibility for many years to come.|`|Awywcn2Caa	yes till the child is 18 for sure.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Yes he does. Unless the new husband ) step-dad now) adopts the baby.|`|SPAZHdXWaa	yes, he has to pay until the child turns 18 or until you close the support case.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Yes.  Unless the new husband wants to adopt the child(ren).|`|lfQHjp5baa	I'm not sure if I understand your question. If your talking marrying him or another guy?  If your talking about her marrying another guy, then Yes, you will pay to pay for the the child you helped to bring into the world.  The chiId is the innocent party you helped to create. If you are talking about if she married you, then Yes you pay again.  This time for BOTH  the child and your wife.  The child till she reaches the age of majority, and your wife till she either gets sick of you, or till  either you or her die.  Sowee,  Dats the facts of life...|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	yes unless you sign over your rights to the child
a375l0D7aa	My experience was that it took two years AFTER the submission of the paperwork. First it was declared annulled by the diocese in which I filed. But it had to be reviewed by another diocese.    There is a considerably long questionnaire that is filled out by the petitioner. The petitioner also names 2 witnesses, who have to fill out paperwork too. Then the other spouse is sent a questionnaire too to be filled out. Whether he or she fills it out, the annulment may proceed. When the papers are filed, the petitioner's questionnaire (but not the witnesses') is available to be reviewed by the other spouse for a short period of time. After that the case is sealed from anyone else except the tribunal.    When the tribunal makes a determination, there can be impediments to future marriages stated in the determination.    By the way the whole process cost me nothing, cause the parish picked up the tab. (They know i am usually broke.) But otherwise the cost would have been like $300 for copying etc.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You tell the priest you want to seek one. You fill out tons of paperwork, and others do as well to tell the story on your behalf. It goes to a committee at the diocesan level and they rule on it. The time varies. Mine took 2 1/2 years.  The pope is not involved. He's rather busy with other issues.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	as far as i no   it has to go to the pope ...
C1Cobi1taa	honestly stay at home... i stayed at home until i got married at 21... saved a TON of money and was more free to spend my money.... and also if you have your own place YOU have to clean EVERYTHING! and it's alot of work! trust me! and if you are gone for over 12 hours a day the last thing you want to do is come home to a messy house and you are not gonna feel like cleaning on the weekends...|`|X0vhUEtoaa	You should leave ONLY IF YOU FEEL YOU ARE READY. It's not that your mom doesn't want you to advance in life, it's that she's not ready for you to. She still wants you to be her little baby.|`|tM35loy4aa	Hello I think she didn't want you move out the house because she kind of felt lonely and probably she miss you that she used to take care of you. Also felt no one is with her thats why she didn't want you to move out of the house.|`|iCKkOWI7aa	stay a little longer|`|eoZJO3J8aa	well if u know ur able to cover rent and bills all on my own and still be able to go to school then go for it.  try and see how it feels living on your own.  i hope you know how to cook..|`|xRFLXYDzaa	OMG! I totally know what you are going through! I'm 19 and living at home and I have classes like that, too. It's hard. I don't know how easy your mom is to talk to, but tell her that it's hard to get things accomplished it you are commuting.     Maybe you can set up rules like you will come home twice a month or if you have younger siblings, they can come and visit...    I hope this helps a little. But believe me, I totally understand where you are coming from. Good luck!|`|Ad0C45Ioaa	Tell her that you need to at least try living on your own/Your an adult now.Explain that you need your own space. Try and make a joke about it like saying imagine how tidy it will be without me here,less clothes washing,less cleaning up to do.She just needs to know the benefits she will get from it.|`|v5gpQqhDaa	move out if its a annoying house your a adult|`|mwJaqJp6aa	maybe she just doesnt want to loose you. imagine yourself in her shoes, she doesnt want you to grow up so fast or she just really cares about you and wants you to focus on your studies instead.|`|KABKMLnmaa	Do what you want but it's defenitely easier at home. Because mommy is always taking care of everything =)|`|6GUARqpCaa	I think your mom is just freaked that she may be loosing you. She has taken care of you for 18 years and can be hard for her to let go. I have to live and experience your own life, and there is nothing she can do to change or stop that. You can help her by reassuring her that you will come back to visit her, or call her. she will get over it eventually.|`|Ob9ksKYPaa	If you are fully educated on finances and your ability to get work AND school done. Then I say go for it. The best money advice I could give you is to MAKE SURE YOU HAVE MONEY TO COVER YOUR EXPENSES AND MORE! You never know if your car needs work or you need extra books for class.     If you can cover these cost:   Rent $__________________  Electrical use $__________________  Telephone $__________________  Cable company $__________________  Online service $__________________  Tenant's insurance (divide annual bill by 12) $__________________  Food $__________________  Toiletries and other personal items $__________________  Transportation costs $__________________  Entertainment $__________________  Repayment of student loan $__________________  Miscellaneous $__________________  TOTAL $__________________    If you are completely sure that you are WELL off and can get this done. Move out. You're old enough!     Get some roommates.|`|Yrkl80zwaa	She is just having a hard time letting go of you. Neither of your opinions are wrong but your mom needs to know that she raised you well enough to go on your own.|`|BSKJdZK3aa	move out if she is interfering with your life eg: treating you like a baby when your girlfriend comes to your house    move out whenever you want a proper age would be 25    personally i would move out but i cant im still too young and my mom is killing me
Tgv83mNQaa	Well if she sits next to him and talks to him a lot then she is most likely telling you the truth and he does like you.  If you really think you don't have a chance then wheres the harm in trying to ask him out,, even a hint. I no when I liked this popular girl I added her on msn and just kept talking about different things until we found out that we had a lot in common.    Then popularity boundaries don't matter. I hope this helps you,, just remember be yourself and be interesting|`|AA12108398	Well liking someone your friend also likes is tough.

He's not fit to be a parent or be around your sister if he's verbally saying these things that are harassing her. He's not going to get custody with the condition he is in. I don't think he'll be in prison for life either but I know that if child services are involved there's no way he's going to put his hands on any of you.    He has to pay child support and his debt.|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	What? you need to learn to spell i can't read a word you wrote|`|RAGAcJV7aa	seek help through the police detective tell them the story bring witnesses with you and accounts and times when he molested your sister and yes he would and should go to jail|`|ra69rxxgaa	I didn't understand anything you wrote.

g0CU1fBsaa	i think you should do what you feel like doing. cuz i TOTALLY know how you feel, i've so been there. You should have a friend come over and keep you company at home. thats what i like to do when im feeling down :]  its your birthday! celebrate somehow.      hope i helped.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  answer mine please?|`|RRzcbvvXaa	well first off Happy Birthday! :) Anyways, well its really up to you whether or not you wanna go out, but I think you're friend is trying to get you in a better mood and to forget about all that bad stuff. It's probably a better idea to go out and have fun with your friend instead of sulking around at home thinking of all that bad stuff. Especially on your birthday! It's really up to you tho|`|XoNKECCKaa	Happy Birthday!  do something you enjoy! (:
K8EJVxLgaa	The key: stay casual. So let's say you have an art project to work on. You go up to get supplies coincidentally at the same time as him.... Crack a joke. Tell him you like his jacket. (Sounds gay, but it'll be a good conversation starter in the future.) And stay confident! There's nothing that turns a guy on more than confidence!|`|6dHIoJLVaa	find something small to talk about, admire his art project get his opinion on yours... the dad working together connection isn't really a turn on... use it as an ice breaker maybe, but not like the meat and potatoes of a conversation.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Well, you could always bring up something about your dad's job. Or you could ask him how his day is going, how his classes are going. Start with really casual stuff like that first, and then build it up to more personal things. It usually works!|`|mWWQR2lIaa	ask to borrow a pencil and then forget to give it back so then he'll come over and ask for it back  act all innocent and flirty!|`|8LEPfGoBaa	go ahead and try to flirt w/ him and make alot of eyes contact. ;)
cgstGNytaa	Take her out to Chipotle everyday. That should do the trick! :)|`|W9VLXTfpaa	take her out to eat, bring her chocolates and candys. Tell her your going to cook especially for her, make a soup or something else and put alot of BUTTER. Dont tell her that, she'll feel so awful.Don't hurt her feelings. Ooh, and send her the sweets if that'll help. If it doesnt work, then just tell her that she looks really sick, and tell her you want to help. If she doesnt want any help by you, dont be with her.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Dont tell someone with an eating disorder that they look gross. She probably has an eating disorder because she thinks she looks gross in the first place (even if she doesnt). You should tell her that you care about her and want her to be healthy. And maybe try to talk to her friends/family and get them involved in helping her.|`|3UM16vmMaa	lol. stop your whining.     I dont know what a 23 inch waist  looks like (I need a visual aid) but just be thankful. Can you see ribs and backbones? then that is thin. If not...then she is fine  and you are a lucky son of a gun.  Many men my mother's age are paying $10000's  to medicate some overweight wife who screwed up her arteries by eating too much. You dont want to be that guy.     Is she truly anorexic? then she needs professional help. If she is just naturally slim... thank your lucky stars.  Most 90 year old people.... are ultra thin!|`|5d92d4d47a0206e6c5d7d342e7d48e8eaa	Tell her that you "like a woman with a little meat on her bones" so its OKAY if she gains weight...

qEsas2Ssaa	I recommend talking to her.  Tell her it hurts when she talks to you that way.  Tell her you love her as a friend and don't want to lose her so please stop joking with you that way because it hurts your feelings.  If she's a true friend, she will stop.|`|g59EeqT0aa	get a new friend! leave her to her new group n move on to someone better who will not put you down...shes truly not a good friend..|`|eD9frdYmaa	im in 7th grade and one of my oldest friends does that to me. it because youve known her for so long you can sorta make fun of each other but not actually meaning it. but sometimes you have to let your friends go if their just not right for you anymore|`|t2xY7xw3aa	It seems to me that your friend just needs attention. And putting you down makes her feel better about herself and higher than you. Trust me, you don't need friends like that. Friends are supposed to make you feel good about yourself. And if this "Sarah" is doing the opposite, then I'm sorry but it's time to find real friends that bring you up instead of down and feel that you are worth their time.    Good luck!|`|mqpmR1Cvaa	she really doesn't sound like a good friend to me. if she was any kind of a friend she wouldn't hurt your feelings. maybe you need to let her know how you feel if she continues to act this way with you she really shouldn't be called your friend|`|52yUTxtZaa	I kinda feel the same way about my cousin, she tends to put me down alot! we're not as close as we used to be! =[|`|cKDX43wZaa	It's a hard decision to come to, but sometimes friendships outgrow you - meaning you may have reached a point where you're now more outgoing and get more attention and it makes her a little jealous and insecure - she obviously has always been and will continue to need to be the center of attention, so if she can't handle "the new you", then you need to find some friends who can.  It's always hard walking away from a long friendship but we grow up, and that's growing pains for ya!|`|cVY7xjg2aa	meet her and say that you need to talk..and then say what you wrote up there:    "Lately, she has been getting on my nerves. She is always subtly putting me down, she will just say little comments like "omg you loser..." and stuff like that. She doesn't mean it as a big deal but it just really grates on me after a while. Do you have any suggestions? I don't want to lose her as a friend, because she is a really good person, she just doesn't seem to appreciate me as a friend."|`|Amkmles0aa	what are you saying|`|yrQQ3dJVaa	Say something to her about it and say that you don't appreciate her calling you name even if she doesn't mean it.|`|WcuYfsWbaa	just tell her how u feel, without yelling at her or acting like ur mad at her. and about the clique/ being together thing, try 2 b slowly accepted by her group, and have her b with urs 1ce in a while. that way, ur both happy and you will b together more often. i hope things work out!|`|1kQLOxpAaa	I think any person who hurts you isn't a real friend. If she is a real friend, you should be able to tell her what she says and does hurts you and she wil appreciate you being honest. If she doesn't change then she doesn't care that she's hurting you and may be doing it on purpose.|`|CEAJBk73aa	My names Sarah! haha, Anyways. My bestfriend is just like that. She hangs out with these two other girls. Theyre my friends too tho. Me and her stopped hanging out for a while. She use to call me a loser too, and mugged me like im wierd or w/e. But as time passed by, she called me and said we havent talked or hang out in a long time. And stuff, but we got closer somehow? haha. She became more nicer. I guess she just wanted to hang out with someone else for a while. I felt the same way too. Just give her some time, okays. [=   You should try making a new friend tho. So if you&"sarah" really do stop talking and shes still being mean, then forget her. haha, Yeahs.|`|cd37yLuZaa	ive had friends like these and you otta just confront her. if she laughs in your face, shes just not worth your time|`|AA12281930	do you really need a friend like that?....as we get older people can grow apart..sometimes its hard but you just have to move on.|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	she's just trying to impress them, talk to her and tell her to please stop, cause it hurts your feelings. girls are better than boys with those things.|`|vKOnv7WZaa	start calling her a loser, whenever she does or say something odd..and see how she reacts...and if she starts saying some smart stuff that makes you feel bad....if u want, you could just let her go as a friend..if not..now you see her true side...or you could just tell her to stop calling you a loser|`|m56Ty3zmaa	I would talk to her about it...tell her it bothers you and how you feel about her always putting you down in that "non-offensive" way...I would think that would be your best bet...see what she says and if she is a true friend...she will understand and listen to you...good luck!!|`|fGTWNtQPaa	i have friends like that but ya know their no one to act like that i have this friend lets call her whore and well shes a ***** just ignore her or put her down like she does u but make it sound like a joke i do it and it makes them shut their mouths|`|X1BaGr0kaa	The next time she calls you a name, just ask her if she could stop because it hurts you. Or you could always try to take it jokingly and call her names too (in a nice way of course!). I'm sure she means to harm by saying this, and isn't even considering that you might be taking it personally.|`|6GNqMJB4aa	I can totally relate to what you are going through.  I have had a couple of "friendships" like that and I had to end them one way or another because I did not want to be around those people anymore.  I am also more of an introverted person and the one thing that I have noticed is that outgoing people are more often likely to say things like what you mentioned that your friend says to you. They say whatever comes to their mind and many times, it is a subtle put down to you and they think that they can get away with it. I'll tell you about my personal experiences. Well, there were a couple of girls that I knew in college that ended up getting on my nerves because they always found a way to put me down subtly. One was my roommate, whom I ended up ignoring for the rest of the school year because of her "cute" little comments.  She always had a comment about whatever I was doing but I never made comments about things that she did.  Then there was the other friend who always made fun of me for being a fast walker.  Well, I tend to walk fast because I take long strides.  It's just a family trait.  But I never made comments about the fact that she is a slow walker, so much so that she resembled a turtle and it irritated the hell out of me, but I never once made a comment about it.  After awhile, I felt like screaming at her because of her daily comments about how I walked.  I think that the way to handle it is to approach them in a nice way and let them know how you feel about their behavior.  If it still doesn't stop, then you do the same thing to them that they do to you.  I bet you they won't like it because no one likes to be made fun of or put down.  If they confront you about this, just say that this is what they always do to you. Maybe they will realize their own behavior.  But if it still does not work, then it is time to end the friendship.|`|t4JYBgo5aa	talk to her, or stop being her friend, i learned that a while back, i lost 2 "good" "friends" the past couple years, and it was hard, but don't worry, God is with you always :D|`|XwtZXbY5aa	Well (same thing happened to me)..  Just ignore it, she'll get bored of it  and stop . Tuuduhhh.   Welcome   Byee
AA11447210	It's never appropriate for a parent to say cruel things to their child. If it's true they should be supportive and help correct the situation, not name-call. That's what immature children do who haven't developed the knowledge or ability to hold a mature conversation or express themselves appropriately.|`|ZVngHOBTaa	yes - he should not want to hurt his daughters feelings...but he could have said worse things so be grateful (if you are the daughter)|`|teoBeZ6zaa	What an evil father!

CEAJBk73aa	Okay, First. Theyre only 12 and 13. They wont last long. Probably.  And second, she is gonna want to be with her boyfriend all the time.  Since im guessing they just started dating, they will be attached to each other. But as time passes by they might get tired of each other.  Like I said theyre only 12 and 13. Young love. hahaha  Find someone else to hang out w/ right now.|`|MRUuRTHeaa	Well, unfortunately that's what happens when your friend gets a bf, they are obsessed w/ him, and leave you in the dust.  I think it would be mean to break them up (unless you suspect they are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing, like having sex?)  You might just want to find some new friends to hang out with, because she won't pay much attention to you while she's with her bf.|`|twSD9zHzaa	tell her and but don't break them up! you will lose your her.     remember sis's before disses

1lUxd2t9aa	Just start with a hey, what's up? and be friendly.  There's this boy in my school who makes friends (who are girls) soooo easily...he's popular with the ladies but only friends not like a pimp and he's single too. He just says hi to them and say like nice shoes and jokes around with them about things he has in common with them or like school like teachers.     I have the same problems with boys:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	At school is so simple. Find a girl you like and say Hi. Then she says hi back. then you say (if there is a test) how was that test. then she replies fine. then you say do you want to hang out (whenever time is best for her). if she says no just relax and try again next week. don't offend her. give her a compliement like i like you top today.we are not aliens just talk and relax.|`|hvZb0r3zaa	Just talk! Dude don't be afraid. Come up with something funny to say.|`|iQ7ubBAfaa	say anything - within reason, even if you look silly, all it takes is a little random conversation and girls will quickly deturmin that you're a nice guy.    be polite.    LISTEN TO THEM. pay attention. show you're interested in them.    be confident, but not over confident.    it takes time, you'll have to learn and you might make mistakes, but chances are they're as afraid of talking to you, so muster up the courage and go for it|`|OqAOCBnFaa	Usually you just walk by them in the hall way and say "Hey, How's it going?" That's a start. On Myspace you have to have met them at school. Once you become sort of friendish with them. You can message and comment them. Usually first is picture comments like "Pretty" or "I like this one." . Don't talk to the same one every single day, that turns it pretty stalkerish. You know? :) Well, if you haven't talked to a girl in a few days she usually says hello to you. If she doesn't you speak to her after a day or two. To make yourself appear not desperate. After a few days of talking she will soon know who you are. Usually she will speak to you. If she tries to avoid you, don't force yourself on her. Just be cool, be normal, and most important, be yourself.|`|RAyRGH1Saa	just talk normaly  dont try to be funny cuz then ull sound stupid  just be yourself      help with the last question i put up?|`|syLCg7f3aa	You just talk to them!

Girls just want you to be yourself..and don't try to show off when talking to them! I hate when boys do that. :)|`|D10tLM5uaa	girls love to talk,so just ask us questions and seem genuinely interested in what we have to say.  and don't be afraid to pick on us [but not too much],it shows your comfortable around us|`|t2YNRxOKaa	awww. okay, well girls aren't that hard to figure out. yeauh we may act like it, but thats not the case. just b yourself. we don't like fake ppl. don't TRY and act all cool, cuz that doesn't work. talk about wat you wanna and just let the conversations flow. feel confident, cuz i mean we girls feel nervous about the whole thing too. just talk confidently, make eye contact, and just b yourself. btw, i bet you don't say stupid things. =]. but i really hope that helps. u seem sweet. |`|QMgRM7eiaa	Ahh man where just girls not god.  just ask how where doing and '''whats up'''|`|OcEGC5kzaa	Umm its not really hard.

I have known a lot of people who were in the same boat as you.    If things aren't bothering you too badly, try and stick it out. If you think you can deal, wait until you move out and heal yourself. Do a better job with your own kids. Hopefully you're old enough that you'll be able to move out in a few years time.    However if its unbearable, have a heart to heart with your mom. Maybe your stepdad too - tell him it's always bothered you & you guys are going to be on a first name basis from now on. However my experience has been that when this happens in a family it gets ugly.Your mom may not be able or just may not want to see your side, thinking things are 'just fine' as they are. Not saying thats definitely what will happen, but I have seen it happen before.    Good luck, and be a better person than them~|`|AA12357399	oh, hun. sorry to hear about this. well, you are 22 yrs old now, so i doubt she can insist that you continue to call this guy "dad". if this guy never treated you like his son, he doesn't deserve the honor of being called dad by you! also, i guess if u started referring to him by his name that would pretty much end your mom's claim that he's your "real" dad. maybe she tells others that he's your dad because she's feels like a failure for having a failed marriage? btw, have you ever tried discussing "father/son" things with him? is your dad anywhere in the picture? good luck!|`|EK4NGPJMaa	I'm not really a mom...but, I just wanted to help :) What happened to your real dad? Perhaps, something really bad..? Hurtful, maybe she is trying to fill a spot in her spot that never was filled after your parents divorce?  Maybe she is trying to forget your real dad? I'm not exactly sure. I'm open to listening. Just message me on here and I'll respond :)   Hope this helps. Good luck to all that may come to you in the future.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	I'm a step-dad. and I hope that I can help with this answer.  My wife and I met when my step-son was a little less than two. and at first I was really adamant about him not learning to call me Dad because I don't think it is fair to confuse a child by making them call you something that you are not. Now he is turning 5 and I believe that he has a better knowledge of who his real Dad is, it is ok for me if he calls me Dad in a sense of understanding social family structure.  And I am trying to teach him now that it is o.k. for other people to call me his Dad too.     Now that you are 22, you should have a talk with your step-dad and tell him the name that you would prefer to start calling him. I'm believe that he will take it lightly with acceptance. than go with him to your mom and tell her what you would like to call him and let every one know that you and your step-dad think it's ok to call each other whatever it is that you want to call each other.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	she prob doesnt want 2 talk bout her 1st husband and explain 2 nosey ppl what happened with her 1st relation ship|`|rh12tX8Naa	Not all moms would lie about that situation. I guess it's the kind of person she is.|`|V6sNY08saa	Your mother does not want to be judged by people.  Some ignorant people may think she is a hoochie for having a child with someone other than the person she is presently married to.  Call the man dad for your mother's sake.  Also, speak to her about him not treating you like a real son, she WILL understand.
EeThBc3Zaa	I am not sure most parents call their kids "son" or "daughter" rather than their first names.  I don't.     I guess maybe your mom regrets that her husband isn't your real dad.  Sometimes I wish my husband were my daughter's real dad and that I had nothing to do with my ex.  I just wish things were tidier, and my life had gone more as planned instead of all going wrong.  I wish we could just be a normal family without divorces and exes and stuff.  But then, I don't ask my daughter to call my husband "Dad."|`|rH33ty23aa	Maybe it is hard for her to accept that she is no longer with your real father and she wants to act. When i left my ex it was very hard for me to accept that. When i remarried it was even harder because i no longer had the same name as my daughter. there is no telling what your mom is thinking, but u are 22 so call him whatever you want, within reason
NpZPYhaRaa	Hello. It is sad to say but their relationship is theirs. They decided long time ago to get married and live together. It is for them to decide if they want to stay together.  It is natural for you and your brother to be scared. We usually fear changes, specially when it comes to our family. You can suggest them to see a counselor or facilitate the communication between them, although it will be very "heavy" for you to get involved with their problems. Probably they have issues to solve by themselves, like your mom's stubbornness. We all have "stuff" to fix in our personalities, haven't we? But, who knows, perhaps they will slip and come back after some time. But do not forget: the only thing that will not change is their love for you and your brother.

This situation is between your parents and no matter what you think their relationship was like the past 20 years only they really know. It is entirely possible that your moms illness is causing her to not be thinking clear and all this will blow over but in the event they do split all you can do is be there for them not taking sides and epically be supportive to your little brother he will need you. I realize nothing would ever be the same but as you grow older you will find this happens often as we grow up and life goes on. Remember its not your fault and you cannot fix it. Good luck you will be alright in the end|`|s1LfdCdsaa	OK, so first of all, Grandma shouldn't be telling you to do anything. Whoever's parent she is, then she needs to bring her child back with her. Let's say she's Mom's Mom and Mom goes and lives with her. Perhaps Dad will realize what he had once she's gone, and perhaps life with Grandma will cause Mom to rethink things with Dad. At that point, they could go to counseling to develop new ways to compromise given their respective illnesses.    In the meantime, you need to call your father and ask him what the deal is. Tell him that if neither he nor Mom are looking out for your brother, by God you will.    The reality of the situation may be that Dad considers Mom to be a burden that he is unwilling to bear. When the going gets tough, it's the cowards who get going.....out the door. At this point, both Dad and Mom seem to be doing the "all about me" thing. Your brother is still a minor, so his interests should be put first. That's why you need to find out what the deal is from Dad so that you know where your brother stands, living arrangement wise. If the house has been sold, it will be time for Mom's relatives to step up to the plate and help.    If Grandma is her mother, then the buck stops THERE.|`|lmqjTTIhaa	GTVE THEM SOME TIME. THEY ARE GOING THRU ALOT GIGHT NOW  MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|GHd84xipaa	have you try talking to them together at the same time?maybe they will sit down with you and you tell them how you feel.that you want to know if everything is alright with them.tell them you heard them talking about divorce.that you want to know why because you though they were very happy together.hey they have been married 21 years maybe something has change in their life and you may be able to help by having them talk about it with you to see if there's something you can do.good luck to you.
BsAQE1Hyaa	Just because you think she's out of your league, she may not feel the same. Ask her out, see what happens...it only take 5 seconds for someone to say yes or no. She may actually surprise you, what have you got to lose? Nothing by the sound of it. And you should definitely not give up before you've even tried. Otherwise, you'll always have that what if? in your mind, take it from someone who knows! Hope this helps and good luck =) x|`|96AQZUGyaa	No! You haven't even tried!!!

That right there should tell you that you're in her league, and you're up at bat.   <br>  <br>  Best not blow it.    My advice?   Be who you've always been.   She already knows that she's drop dead gorgeous.   She doesn't need any wussy guys telling her that.    And she's recognized those jerks and asshats for what they really are.  Jerks and asshats.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT :   Dude, that was just an excuse.   Hot women have the same insecurities that you and I have.

Also, we befriend his friends and get the details about his life etc.  "Facebook stalking" sometimes occurs.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	dude    they just stare at us  thats all they do   and then they look away really fast when we sense them looking at us|`|dalNxu8zaa	talk to our friends and see if they have been with the guy aand see wat he is about...or we just watch them over a period of time|`|JNUWzHGzaa	if im intrested in a guy then ill like look at them a few times and try to make eye contact with them.

The color will make your eyes pop and it will look awesome in my opinion!!  Hope i helped!|`|W9VLXTfpaa	darken some of your hair.  Layer it a little, give yourself a little bit of an edge.Or maybe some highlights, NO BLONDE.Thats out of style now. Ive done it, its stupid.  Your pretty, your hair will be the most change for a new look, good luck.|`|IbbQK960aa	You are not giving us much to go on with those pictures. I like what i see (don't do anything stupid) good luck|`|J14tPA9Eaa	whats wrong with this looks i kinda like it|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Full body picture please?|`|9c15770fd6d857446f96f27ee4e8bde9aa	Girl your cute, you don't need to change anything!!!|`|A0r2qWaHaa	You are so pretty! You don't have to lose weight! If you want to do something fun, than enhance your natural beauty!  Maybe get the top of your hair highlighted in a color that ecentuates your color already! Do some face bronzer on the areas that the sun naturally hits, your temples, cheekbones, nose and chin. Buy some makeup and experiment! Have fun!|`|AA10778911	change your hair|`|mWWQR2lIaa	whatever you do, please dont cut your hair short its so nice  i say dye it all brown,  wear some more mascara  get a bit more of a tan   get a shorter fringe more sweeping  in my opionion    xx|`|ikekDCRxaa	Get a fringe :) but not a side fringe! Layer your hair a bit, i'd say chop it to your shoulders. Try pink streaks, they look great in blond hair. Use eye shadows such as baby blue, gold and fresh green with mascara. Try sparkly lip glosses from the body shop and gypsie scarves|`|WbbwpeSGaa	Maybe haircut short but not too short, styled to fit your lovely round face. make-up only slightly just highlights. don't lose weight clothes not to loud or too conservative.|`|d7ISUrkYaa	you're very pretty.  you should try putting on some make-up  not dramatically but make it look natural  and i love your hair by the way.|`|Sora8bglaa	Well in my opinion you are freaking gorgeous, I'm not gonna say you look sexy or hot cause to me thats like saying "Hey, let's have a one night stand."  Lol  Anyways, you look really beautiful, the only thing you could possibly add to your looks to make you better is a smile.    I mean if you want, experiment with your hair a little bit, maybe get black highlights so that it makes your natural haircolor pop out and it will also make your eyes pop out a little more.  I also liked the bronzing idea the girl above me had, but don't go crazy with it.  You don't wanna be orange.    Clothes wise, maybe just show at places like Hollister, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, Pac-Sun places like that.  Don't change tooooo much cause you really are gorgeous the way you are now.  If you try to change to much you might take away from your natural good looks, and that wouldn't be good at all!    I hope this helps.  =]    Feel free to email me ;]|`|QJmlVUAaaa	Your already cute, but since your wanting a makeover here's a couple things I think will give you a fresh new look:    HAIR:  I think a perm would go great with your hair since it's so long. I can actually see you as a brunette since it will make your eyes standout.  http://www.bombhead.com/bbs/skin/monster...    MAKEUP:  As for your makeup,your really naturally pretty so I wouldn't overdo it. You look like you have cute dolly features so try focusing on the eyes (mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow) the cheeks (pinkish color) and the lips (nude with a slight tint of pink). There are plenty a good brands out there such as MAC.  http://www.makeup-artist.co.za/e107_imag...    CLOTHES/SHOES:   I'm not sure what your style is, but you'd look best in something cute and not "showy." Personally, I think a fob style will fit you since you have a really innocent look. It's something different and fresh too.  http://forum.asiajam.com/general-fashion...
y42LEQL3aa	That's how girls are man. They get self conscious if you suddenly stop complimenting them.|`|uQ4J21BTaa	Don't compliment all the time. Spread it out so she won't expect it all the time.

AA12108398	Awe its cute to actually read a mature, loving guys opinion for once! haha she's probably interested in you-partly because your older. Just be careful because she's still young and don't take advantage of her. Maybe you could talk to her dad about taking her on a date, she'll love that. You need to gain his trust. He is a father of a teenage girl, they are all the same. He's probably even worse cuz you are older.    frighteningtruth.webs.com|`|c3CxzUgcaa	I think she does. She just can't do anything about it because of her dad. I mean, she is only 15.|`|EK4NGPJMaa	Of course she is. All the signs. Even though her dad is a holding her back, don't let that ruin your chances of being with that girl. Of course she might not be your high school sweetheart, but she could be with you for awhile if your that clicky together :) Good luck, hope it all works out.
dalNxu8zaa	tell him...he is cheating and that is not good...  arent u hurt about that|`|3kNeWYvdaa	First tell your boyfriend about it and see what his advice is. Your best friend can't help but feel this way, but tell her that he's your boyfriend and is not available to her and as your friend try and move on to someone who is available. And just in case tell your boyfriend to keep his distance from her for abit maybe those feelings for him will go away when she sees less of him.|`|cKeghBi7aa	tell her to get over him hes yours|`|uVH046Fjaa	Tell her to stop.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Theres nothing you can do.|`|1cBV1V3iaa	tell her to get her own|`|lb7exqUgaa	talk to her about it. and make sure your boyfriend hasnt exchanged those feelings with her.|`|zc47CJZ4aa	Talk to her about it.

Because you had such a fun and great half term, you must feel a bit depressed having to go back to school, which is understandable. Perhaps just because you are tired, you are getting more agitated/irritated at little things. Also, you may be having your period, which also sounds justifiable with these symptoms.

You need some endorphins to cheer you up. They are the 'happy' body chemicals. There are several ways of making endorphins in your body. The 2 best known are 1. chocolate or 2. exercise.

x4KPgL7saa	I believe that if he was sexually abused ... his reaction should had been a little bit different ... more like avoiding the conversation (because he only wants to forget about it) ... Or yes ... maybe it could had been like you said ... so he wants revenge ...  I doubt that he was molested ... he might have been close to someone that was though ... or maybe he's just sick about all that people (I mean, don't you also think it's HORRIBLE?)  And him having nieces and little kids that are so close to him ... might made him even more angry about all this situation ... I don't think it was the way you pictured it & I really hope so ...  Hope this was helpful. Have a nice day.|`|AA10905383	I think that either he was molested, or he was close with someone who was.    If he can't talk about it, don't try to get him to.    If it did happen, it was likely when he was a child and he doesn't know how to cope with it and tries to forget that it ever happened.

AikAMGQaaa	I think that's called revenge cheating. It happens all the time.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	Yea, called getting back at the other.  Game Playing.  If you aren't happy with each other, go your separate ways.  Do you think you could live the rest of your life with a guy that does that?  I wouldn't.  Good Luck!|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	what do you mean, like that they cancel each other out?  Two wrongs don't make a right|`|AN9PdKmgaa	if you found out your lover was cheating why would you degrade your self to sleep with someone just to get him back for it that makes you even lower
ikekDCRxaa	I'd say try texting him some other time or just leave it up to him. Watch a movie, call your friends, make a home made face pack etc to distract yourself at first then just don't worry about it. Remember, guys often don't text back for millions of reasons so in the future i wouldn't worry about it.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I think you should stop being so eager.  he won't like it.|`|P0UpHgmLaa	Don't be so pushy because you'll drive him away...and it sounds like you two need to have more face to face conversations...go on a date!|`|AA10778911	i used to do that, dint get so caught let him call you its much better
AA10905383	I don't think it would be disloyal, but if you want to make sure you won't upset your girlfriend, try bringing some other work buddies. The secretary will get to know you and the other people better.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	ask your GF.  You can have 20 people tell you 20 different things but none of it matters if your GF views it as cheating.    a good rule of thumb:  if you wouldn't do it in front of her or if you wouldn't want her doing it or you have to hide it from her then it's cheating.    edit:  fwiw:  I wouldn't view it as cheating but to be on the safe side, I agree bring other coworkers or invite your GF so you don't create a false impression with the other woman.|`|nC92yqx7aa	Its ok if you tell her and she says its good. My question to you is why the crap would you go to a bar with this girl when you already have a ******* gf? Just friends huh? bullshit.|`|AA10778911	if you have your girlfriends permission then no its not cheating|`|rYhm4LN1aa	its not disloyal. you let her know, theres nothing wrong with it.    but being female, she probably got a bit  jealous. and she probably will every time your with another female. as long as u let her know what ur doing and invite her to join ect, theres nothing wrong with it.|`|ZfoBpMxBaa	Best thing is to be upfront and honest with your girlfriend first. If she's not cool with it, explain to the secretary and apologize that you can't go. She'd understand being a woman, unless she had designs on you herself.|`|lb7exqUgaa	I agree with something someone said earlier. Invite your other co-workers so she can get to know the other people at the office also. I personally think it looks bad that you havent thought of inviting them. but whatever thats just me.|`|D35SFHbTaa	As long as you're honest with your g/f and don't do anything stupid with the secretary, then you should be fine. Of course, I'm speaking for myself, and your g/f may not be as understanding.    Talk to her about it.|`|jPhHG7wBaa	No..as long as your girlfriend knew, was fine with it, and you did nothing with the secretary..nothing was disloyal.|`|c3CxzUgcaa	Not as long as you are honest and upfront about it with her. Letting her know, and offering to take her along is not disloyal. Going behind her back and not telling her is disloyal.|`|s1oDY9Tfaa	I think as long as you're honest with her and make her feel secure and comfortable with the situation, then it should be fine. You should also make it clear to the woman that you're going with that you are in a serious relationship and that you aren't looking to be anything more than to be friends with her. This way, you'll be straightforward and honest to both of these girls.
E3O2Gi0Uaa	no ur not a ***** and those guys are d**ks|`|85tAhnM9aa	I guess I'd give you respect. But did all these guys at your school go to the same asshole academy?

My ex-boyfriend would always slap me and sware at me, and I knew he was cheating. I know I'm not a guy, but I respect you.
kX2OWqP7aa	You need to tell him exactly what happened and how you feel about it.  He probably feels like its his fault and that you didn't want him to do it.  Tell him what happened and that you really like him, but you were just caught by surprise but would love to try it again.|`|WJKzAmr7aa	Nobody's first make-out is totally smooth. He might have jumped into it fast and scared you a little. But if you take it slow and gradually move to making out, you will be much calmer. Or next time YOU take the lead that way you can't freak out because your in control. And guys like it when a girl takes control.|`|sxegmou2aa	The first time I made out with someone was with my best friend. I really wasnt expecting it so it really scared me. Next day at school I couldnt even see him, I was som embarrased. But after that we ended up going out. Making out with someone is kinda lik having sex, you have to be ready for it for you to enjoy it. Next time, maybe instead of waiting for him to make out with you, you make out with me; that way you will do it when you feel youre ready for it and he wont caught you off guard again.|`|LKchOjCNaa	make sure u r really ready and dont feel pressured and do it privitly and wear lip balm but not to much that hes wearing it after but make sure u r ready and above all make sure u r both sure u want to do it and that ur not rushing it a bit and then u should feel ready and make sure u both no that its coming hope this help from Rebecca Xxxxx|`|Ad0C45Ioaa	You make the first move on him this time .At least then you will be prepared.Tell him you want to make out with him and im sure you will both lean in for it .GOOD LUCK.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Funny, I always thought "making out" meant kissing. Guess I'm behind the times lol    Whatever it was you were up to, you obviously weren't ready for it.  Why not leave it for a while, particularly since your boyfriend is not being pushy about it?  Give yourself some time, and take things slow.  No reason to hurry into something you are not ready for that is freaking you out.|`|6boH5X5Baa	its only beacause he took you off guard i suggest that next time you see him you lean over and kiss him it wont be unexpected for you and your boyfriend will know that you want to make out with him
DlBeFoKcaa	your safe...you can marry your second cuz ne day babe!|`|d08rkYlpaa	Don't be concerned about the fact you are second cousins, that's not a problem in any society or country in the world, and you are also fine legally. The only thing that matters is that you love each other. The 2nd cousins thing is just an interesting fact, it doesn't have to have any effect on you.  For example, science says that if you have children, you actually have a smaller chance of the kids having birth defects than unrelated people, more likely to have more children and grandchildren, have fewer miscarriages, and less likely to get divorced.  Many famous people married their cousins, such as Einstein, Bach, Giuliani, Roosevelt, Darwin, and all the crowned heads of Europe.  over a billion people in the world live in countries where most marriages are cousins.  So relax, enjoy, have sex, but be careful you can handle the consequences of course. Don't let people tear you apart from each other because of their misconceptions about what is acceptable. Stand together as partners, make plans for a good relationship together.|`|ZVngHOBTaa	im glad its not your first cousin because then sex would be an issue|`|teoBeZ6zaa	ewww|`|g3S7QbSXaa	It's legal, assuming you are both 18 (But I doubt you are). The only problems that would come up are from family members who disapprove. And you must consider how much they are involved in your lives or what would happen if they discovered what's going on.
2pD0ctnhaa	Be more confident and independent, don't be clingy, if he wants you so bad, he will chase more.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Stop being demanding.  Boys don't like it.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Just because your mother thinks this does not mean her entire generation thinks that way. I am 57 and I totally disagree with her. I think people who are together need space and time to do their own thing and to keep their individuality. It keeps the relationship healthy.    Your mother just believes in co dependency.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	I didn't read the whole thing but it's not weird he doesn't always include you I mean we act different from when we are with guys tahn if we are with girls he might not want his friends to see the softer side of him.|`|teoBeZ6zaa	LOL. Your mom is probz just trying to protect you!!
DLS60sVBaa	It seems you prefer the one you knew since 4th grade, so by all means if you think it's a better time now maybe you should try with her. If not and you equally the other one and you think it is a good time then go with that one.
GmPIU2MNaa	You have to talk with your friend. You can't blame him if he likes her, but then you have to make it clear, that you also like her, and not is going to hold back.. Then you have to talk with her, to know about she's even interested in you. If she don't know the answer, or says no.. then prove you are the right for her.... 3 months is long time, without there is happen anything - maybe she thinks you not are interrested, or it is going to slow.. Ask her... Ask her what she wwantsto get out of your dates. Clearness is the best thing, if love is invold ^^, Good luck sweetheart :D i hope it all will went well for you :D|`|aa489aa0a7c4628062eeb385b97bd1c4aa	get over her...she's no good 4 ya..    i say this as a girl who has sort of done the same thing|`|ahjUjX92aa	Talk with your friend. If he likes her then it time to end the relationship with both of them. It against the "rules" of dating, you never hit on a friends gf/bf. And you never hit on your gf/bf's friends. Even ex's with out asking. Even if you really like this girl is she really worth all the pain????|`|6foktYEEaa	Whoa, that's horrible. You should speak with your best friend about what's his relationship with your girlfriend. Keep that in mind that you're dating your girlfriend, not your best friend doing your job. Both of them might have a thing together. Do you guys hang out together? Does she always ask if your buddys coming along when you and your girlfriend are together? If she constantly does that, then it's time to get rid of her. Why? because she's only using you to see your best friend. Good luck, hang in there. Make the right decision before you get hurt!

It is a perfectly healthy expression of your sexuality and a release of tension.  So long as it doesn't interfere with your everyday doing then don't worry about it.|`|WbbwpeSGaa	Find a good lotion and then add some red pepper to the lotion keep your hands moisturized with lotion|`|lbsskdmuaa	dude don't stop i have tried as well. its too hard. once you start you dont stop. there isn't anything wrong with it. just do it a little less. anyways if you stop you might be more stressed out and get blue balls haha|`|esLaRv4Eaa	Have at it that is the safest sex there is. If you feel cheap take your self out to dinner first.|`|05e9dd0404d485ed4d3dabb41de9f040aa	Well. Avoid the situations that cause you to masturbate. This includes stop thinking about sex. Anything you feel like it tell yourself that you are after long-term pleasure (which is satisfaction that you overcame this challenge) and not short-term pleasure (masturbation).     Some basic pointers    Do not watch pornography.   Avoid admiring yourself when you are naked.  Avoid touching yourself in ANY sensual way.  When alone always wear tight clothes. For example when going to sleep wear a tight pair of jeans (shorts) (or two pairs). so that it is hard for you to unzip youself if you get the temptation. By doing this even when you get the urge and start unzipping you will get some thoughts in  your mind that will drive you away from it.    You must always remember that when you fail you must get back up and keep telling yourself that it was just a setback and that you will win the battle.    Remember, think of good things and positive things.|`|EGLH7Aoiaa	Dude, masturbating's fun. It helps relieve stress, it's something to do when you're bored, and if you don't, you get blue balls.|`|m6xvhlJqaa	Well....  Why do you need to stop?|`|lfcbi9cYaa	Your problem isn't "masturbation".  Your problem is that you're either too young to be involved in a serious relationship or single.  So, it's not possible to give you the proper advice due to the lack of details.|`|rh12tX8Naa	Why do you have to stop?|`|AA11447210	Easy...do not touch your penis other than to urinate.    Problem solved.|`|frrGSVjqaa	Why do you have to?  The best way is to just get involved in a lot of things so you don't have time to.|`|6dHIoJLVaa	exercise, join a sports team or a club, hang out with friends more.  There isn't anything wrong with masturbation until you don't feel good about it.  Just don't do it because your depressed or lonely, it isn't a solution to those problems.|`|6boH5X5Baa	find something else you like doing and use the time u spent masturbating on a new hobby
VtvcOHZsaa	Well since he is always hanging out with YOU, constantly trying to make YOU laugh, talking to YOU, and said he doesn't hang out with her enough to ask her out, Congratulations! From the information given he defiantly likes you!|`|xgofDmZ0aa	he could be just liking you as a friend.  and it seems like if he said that he doesnt hang out with the other girl enough when your friend told him to ask her out, that could show that he wants to hang out with her more to ask her out.    if i was you i would just straight up ask him.    or have your friends ask him!|`|Mb9Zrfutaa	i personally think he like you.    but you will never know until you ask. & i could give you a long story about what happened when i didnt tell a guy i liked him but just take my word for it,, you need to ask him if he likes you.    mkayy ? [:|`|ZfoBpMxBaa	Talk to him. Just tell him you're interested and think he may be too, but being young and inexperienced yourself, you may be misinterpreting his attention. And let him know being friends would be cool too, but you just wanted to get it out in the open.
f2R0QzUyaa	It is an old school belt. When men leave their wives to go on war or something they put this on their wives, lock it and take away the key. It is made of steel. It is to prevent their wives from having sex with any other guy. How? Because it is wrap around the vagina of the women.|`|99hfFssXaa	you wrap it around your "private" area and put a lock on it so nobody can get in there.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	A chastity belt is belt and crotch plate with a lock and key that men would force their wives to wear in medieval times, to prevent them from sleeping around when they were away at war.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	It's a Masterlock for your private part.|`|gu68z1Fcaa	its a belt that is used for a girl or a boy and for a girl it covers up her "holes" so they cant have any sex. and for a boy its a device that covers your penis so u cant have sex.|`|puUStDPpaa	hahah its a figure of speech most of the time, but there literally is a thing called a chastity belt, google it.|`|ejbSFv0caa	A lockable device that looks a bit like metal underpants, designed to stop sexual intercourse.    They were very popular in Medieval times. Especially when the husband was away fighting wars whilst the wife stayed at home.
QIQNzE11aa	I'd get a bottle of soda he likes and put it on ice in a bucket. Then i'd make a scrumptious dinner, something that i knew was his favorite. Doesn't have to be fancy, just his favorite. Then i'd buy him a card to tell him how wonderful you feel he is and all he has accomplished! <br>  <br>  Put on some music and enjoy the night! Make sure you got a yummy dessert as well! Then... well... you should know how to end the night off! :)  He'll remember the night for a long time in coming. Know that you were proud of him! Know that you understood his hard work in this area and support him. <br>  <br>  It's a long road and one that has many hard and difficult times. Make sure you show him that it's all been noticed and appreciated. Many men don't hear how proud people are of them, so make sure you use the words.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	A cake that says "Good Job".

I did ask my husband how he felt about it being year 2 and he said, "A hell of a lot better than last year!".  If your guy is the type that needs that kind of acknowledgment - go for it - get some dinner and "toast" to his accomplishment (alcohol free of course...).  If he's a low key kinda guy - don't make a fuss.|`|LU7WB6Poaa	Buy him something cool that he'll really appreciate.  Maybe try buying him tickets to see his favorite band.

Sometimes tears don't even come out because you're just too overwhelmed by that unbearable pain right on your heart or near it. Other times tears might come raining down, making your lips salty dry and your eyes red-swollen. Instantly, you'd feel dizzy and most likely have to lie down on the bed. I once tried so hard to stifle my cry because I didn't want to worry any of my family members, and it just feels like being choked.<br>  Hope I described it right.|`|3yDmWKlFaa	First sad and depressed.

Mine has to be with a guy who I had been dating for a little while, and I moved to NYC and he came to visit me. The whole time before his visit, he was like: I'm going to take you on a night on the town... you won't pay a cent all night, blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  I picked out a nice (casual and cute... but certainly not ritzy) restaurant.. we ordered an appetizer, dinner, and a bottle of wine. When the bill came, he grabbed it and gasped. He rubbed his forehead and was like, Um.... do you mind paying for your meal? I don't want to pay this entire thing. the bill was like, $75! It wasn't even that bad! I couldn't believe how cheap he was being, and on top of it... he left a terrible tip. I didn't bring money because I thought HE was taking me out... so I had to leave to go to the ATM and come back like a big douche bag.
4p9ez6PHaa	Well im gonna be blunt. he sounds like a Jerk for hurting such a sensative girl. I cant tell you weather or not to marry him but i can tell you thins... a relationship should have a firm basis on trust. and if you cant trust him now how will u later? Really think about the options and the effects of staying with him or breaking it off. but the 2 main things in a relationship are Trust and Communication. Remember that.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You shouldn't marry some one you don't trust. If counseling does not help, leave him. Marriage only makes problems worse.|`|AA10351134	Here is a common scenario. You have a person who doesn't like to get close to people. In order to maintain that protective shell, she chooses a partner who is hurtful, abrasive and even demeaning. In other words, she experiments with trusting someone who's clearly inappropriate to trust. That way, when he inevitably tramples on her, she can tell herself she was right to avoid intimacy all along.<br>  <br>  There is one way to break out of this, and that is to find a really good therapist. After some time in counseling, you'll probably find you have no desire to marry this person. In the meantime, postpone the wedding.|`|iuSrMdwmaa	Do not take the blame for this. It is not your defence mechanism that is ruining the relationship, it is his behaviour that already has.<br>  <br>  Once trust is gone it is gone - and if the situation is so bad now it is not going to get any better once you're married. In fact, it is likely to get worse. And if he is abusing you now (putting you down is a form of emotional abuse) he's not going to stop, he'll just ramp the abuse up.<br>  <br>  Why are you even thinking about going ahead with the wedding? You deserve better. You deserve someone who will love, cherish and respect you. And that person won't find you while you're still with a jerk.|`|KZuNW3iFaa	Won't work out unless things change, get counseling if you think u can love this person for the rest of your life, if not end it now before you waste more time.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	why don't you find a counselor and talk about it?  there's got to be a reason why you act that way but it shouldn't effect your entire life.  on the other hand, if this guy puts you down for any reason, that ain't right and that ain't love.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	It's not your defense mechanism that's ruining the relationship, it's your fiance's disrespectful treatment of you.  Why would you marry someone who mistreats you, repeatedly lies to you, puts you down and whom you can't trust?  That's no life.  You're not the one who's wrong here, dear.
pUvEmPrCaa	Go with what you want, not what your maid of honor wants.  Crying on a wedding is normal and beautiful and it's going to show everyone at the reception how much you care about your father and what a strong relationship you have.  Not everyone has that kind of relationship with their father and it's something that should be bragged about and shown off and cherished.  I would love to show that off and get emotional around my father.  I'm sure he'll also try to calm you down and make you laugh and keep you composed.  But that song sounds sweet.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i think that whatever song you choose the likely hood of you crying is pretty high.  your MOH shouldn't have said anything. who is she to tell you what you should or shouldn't use.    my father daughter dance was to 'i loved her first' by heartland. i used that song before it got really big, and everyone else used it as well.  you could also try something a little more fun and upbeat like 'my girl' if you are really worried about crying.hope that helped|`|kdBhSqqfaa	I like the second option, because I really hate Celine Dion! I think that song is really over-played at weddings. I think the second option sounds fun.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Stick with your original choice :) Its your wedding and dance not the moh's|`|a428f88b57a4d3555eaef1e3fc94a2efaa	just go with what youd like|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah go with stand by me.  celine dion is so overdone and schmaltzy.  oldies are better.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I like Stand by Me! It's such a sweet song. My cousin and her husband actually had it as their first dance, I cried! I'm such a softee!
w8KBasGYaa	I've experienced it.  I just let him go because such an action showed that he even didn't have the guts to justify his departure.|`|g0CU1fBsaa	make sure shes not in danger. contact people she knows!!!      hope i helped.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  answer mine please?|`|dBkEqT2naa	It probably means that the preson doesn't care about you to send you a note.|`|kgNkuNOJaa	first i will i look if she/he 's fine...then i'll leave her alone i let her do what she wants! she'll get back 4 sure ;)))|`|X1BaGr0kaa	I would check with everyone else who knows that person to see if they heard from him/her. If they haven't either, and it's been more than a few days, you might need to call the police.|`|VxyyFunmaa	yo sup    wow that would be hard on me cuz i cant even take it easy when complete strangers i meet on the net u know sorta stop talkin to me and stuff.. but most of my good friewnds keep in touch really often thats why they are classified as that and many of my friends know each other i would contact others and try to  find out wad happened and stuff and how to get back together...    peace out!@|`|QI2OxkImaa	you could try my cell phone is (631) 555-5555
W0IqNBRUaa	yeah break up with him. <br>  that is just wrong...<br>  do u want to see ur bf take it like a champ? i dont.. eww|`|xbISxnmfaa	Well obviously it bothers or else you wouldnt be asking this question. I think you should dump him.|`|POHWTDPRaa	That's up to you.|`|z6d6k1Ltaa	That depends on what you want from your relationship.  If him being a bi-guy is uncomfortable to you, you need to move on, cause you aren't going to change him.|`|0lnamekJaa	You should either break up with him if you feel he will cheat on you or you should negotiate a polyamours relationship so that both of you can be emotionally and physically fulfilled.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	No. Invite over another guy you think is good looking and take advantage of the situation.<br>  <br>  Menage a trois!|`|dcd11iUwaa	get the hell out of there before he gives you AIDS!|`|LzZtdlc8aa	not if you love him and he loves you maybe look into swinging with other couples or a threesome u might enjoy that just be open minded about it and be honest he is who he is and you are who you are if you cant handle him swinging both ways then this relationship is doomed just try to understand his stand point on things. and look into other options.....sexually..... just because he is bi doesnt mean he doesnt love you there is SO many other things in life then just sex and if you guys get along as best friends then i say u shouldnt let that ruin your relationship|`|Po2UqfvWaa	depends. what does bi have to do with it. it's being faithful. being bi isn't a get out of jail free card to do what you want. and excuse to hump the male because you like both. wtf|`|0imjbygmaa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww<br>  <br>  break up with him pronto <br>  <br>  He is going to start using your stuff, and he WILL leave you for a man eventually.|`|acafdcce761f87a23b935269eb5f71f2aa	Use condoms.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Accept it or move on.|`|PuVgZiddaa	there is no such thing as a bi man, he is gay move on|`|FzFSzilmaa	yes..<br>  <br>  are you homophobic... or don't trust him???|`|M03NxWlPaa	Why would you break up with him><br>  unless you are against the gay community i don't see any point in breaking up with him.<br>  <br>  If you love him, just accept him for everything he is. <br>  <br>  If he has trusted you enough to come out to you you obciously mean a lot to him, and breaking up with him over it would crush him. <br>  <br>  Dont do it.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	i would break up with him tho me being a guy doesnt count, it would suck to have to tell your friends he left you for a guy. Better than risk your heart, if you cant deal with it then let it go, would be better for both of you rather than doing something you're not comfortable with and lying to yourself|`|cyt7oh97aa	it's only a problem if you make it a problem.  if he's bi and is with you but wants to date other men and you are not into an open relationship, then it probably won't work out for you.  but just because he's bi doesn't mean he doesn't like you anymore.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	It will be a hard thing to deal with so if you're not in love with him I'd end it.  Bi people can almost never be happy with the person they're with.  He'll always be attracted to other guys too and eventually he'll give in to the temptation to be with one.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	This is a hard one, if he's bi...he may never be fully satisfied with just you. (is how I would feel) You  need to talk more to him about this, let him know your concerns, get them all out in the open. And, appreciate the fact that he told you! That should mean a lot.|`|AA11358256	Break it off if you can't deal with sharing, would you deal with it if he was straight and seeing another woman?|`|NET9UMSGaa	break up...it wont last long...|`|mFWf5uWOaa	if he loves you and is with you why dose it matter if hes bi?|`|cMsC5a14aa	Break up with him before he gives you AIDS or something|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	3-way,|`|oC4wxtWIaa	Personally i would not stay with him|`|kQDWVRvzaa	I would dump him in a minute. Aids anyone.|`|RrWVs4nZaa	respect him for who he is|`|Fulmgnmsaa	Tell him that if he really loves you he won't be bi. That is wrong God put man AND woman on the eart for a reason.|`|YwuwL21Gaa	obviously..he has no interest in you...leave him !|`|F5MnZ2hSaa	My ex used to go on about it, which was annoying. If he gets annoying, leave. Otherwise... he's like anyone else.|`|0Od4mOtGaa	If you don't love him : Yes.<br>  <br>  If you do love him: No. His sexuality means he is still attracted to you and it doesn't affect him wanting to be with you. He's just attracted to males and females. So unless you're really jealous or don't trust him, you have no reaosn to break up :) <br>  <br>  Hope it works out x|`|xsewMaqRaa	no...if  you love him accept him for who he is. There is no way to change someone who accepts that they are either gay or bi. He told you for a reason...its because he loves you that he told you.***<br>  <br>  But if for some reason you find that he cheats on you with another GUY than its better to call it off....|`|eovVkQxLaa	dont break up with him just cuzzz hes bi<br>  i've had a bi boyfriend b4 so i can relate<br>  just talk to him about it about the guildlines of u 2<br>  for example: would you be okay if he had a boyfriend at the same time? or is that considered cheating in your book?<br>  pplz opinions vary|`|T8ph72Czaa	Having to share your boyfriend with another girl would be unacceptable. How is sharing him with a guy any different. Bi or not, he needs to commit to you and stay away from other "love interests".<br>  <br>  I hope things get sorted out! Good luck.|`|ZxCLrB1Taa	there is no such thing as bi, he's gay hun, he just doesn't want to admit it because culture and society wont except it. There is nothing wrong with being gay, but I don't believe in bi, either he's gay or he's straight.|`|EUKwxpZhaa	Well even though being a bisexual girl myself i think if u trust him then dont worry bout it because when ur n love u dont want to be with anyone but that "one" and if ya'll are that for each other then be with him. Just be happy and dont regret your decision.|`|7VwdSHd8aa	up to u personally whether u can deal with it or not, but it shouldnt affect ur relationship if ur both faithful and care about each other. what if u had a relationship with a girl would you expect that toaffect future relationships ?|`|2bC0dvPKaa	If he's bi then that means he's not sure whether he 100% likes girls. And that means that he's not sure if he 100% likes you. End the relationship - it's bound not to last.|`|8CXotQVVaa	have a threesome|`|RzZBU8elaa	wow thank goodness you know now instead of later<br>  that could be a major problem in the future<br>  you might want to seperate now|`|7HGPaUwIaa	it all depends weather you trust him or not...<br>  if you have love & trust then you really don't have an issue...|`|VBgzgoUMaa	If you do not mind the fact that he just MAY be 100% GAY but isn't out all the WAY.......then fine......but be prepared for him to come out fully one fine DAY|`|2IxYVm5oaa	i would... but if you TRULY LOVE him then don't i guess.<br>  keep in mind you have double the competition.|`|Tlzzuuamaa	dump his ***! how in the hell can he be bi?|`|PogGNoIkaa	make him change|`|Y38ZGHUDaa	no....|`|aH8exS7oaa	yes u should *****
EvpoKO4Jaa	HELL yeah ..good question. society puts so much pressure on us to adhere to its norms of propriety, it can become very unnerving at times. that is why im rude to all the boys in my class cause im constantly gripped with the fear that i might come off as a whore. maybe thats because i live in 3rd world country where people are still adamant on relegating women to lower 'ranks' than men.|`|62TvIinPaa	Unfortunately true .... But it'll take quiet a long time(generations!!) to overcome this mentality, in reserved, orthodox countries like India and many others.|`|NCvvwPEdaa	Yup, particularly in India.|`|pDptioSNaa	Just the phobia of being called a 'Tease' keeps me 3 steps ahead !|`|iu6aPL98aa	Adult-<a href="http://exbi.info/" rel="nofollow">http://exbi.info/</a>|`|wz8gx3gaaa	It is most obvious thing, particulary, in Indian sub-continent.|`|rkZhVpvgaa	You are right, it is thought to be characterless if a woman gives in easily to sexual overtures of any persons other than your lover or husband.
6iDjNKxHaa	loving and caring personality, Sweet hearted, beautiful eyes and smile, with a big booty|`|0fVtHNtmaa	They have curves and boobs|`|d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa	Looks, plus charm.
w6T9JiHdaa	I understand that you're shy, cause I'm shy, but if hes you're boyfriend you should. idk. Try to drop hints to him so maybe he'll ask.|`|njtGMFw7aa	Maybe your shy because you really like him. you should just text him and tell him that you really want to go see a moive.. maybe he will ask you to go.. idk cuz i never been shy around my boyfriends. just act yoursel around him. guys love when a girl can be herself.  hope this helps =]|`|sYD3CNfZaa	uhhh thats stupid like if you really like him then talk to him  dont be one of those playground couples one that just walk around the field -_-  your shy because your afraid you'll do something embarrassing but just chill..|`|4NI6QDDuaa	i totally understand. i am really shy too. i think it's just being 13 or maybe it's just us, but never the less, you should drop hints, like, 'i'm gonna be so... bord this weekend, i don't have ANYTHING to do.' or something like that. if he's smart he'll hopefully get the message, or if it's easier via text/notes, send a text/give him a note. hope it works out. (i'm rootin' for you!) go get 'em!! (i should be a cheerleader, LOL!!! =) )
tsBL19qzaa	I would leave her, but I wouldn't go running to the first thing that comes along. Reason: You don't have much in common with her, you don't really love her, you can't trust her fully and your instincts are telling you she isn't the right one for you.<br>  <br>  Get over the fact that if you leave her, you will be hurting her. You have no responsibility for how SHE deals with the breakup. If you want to waste more time, with something that you really don't want to do, then go ahead and stay with this person. But, in the future,  when you do get the guts to do what you have to do, you will be asking yourself " why did I waste all of that time with her?"<br>  <br>  You only have X amount of time given to you in this life. Don't waste it.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Def leave your gf. No sense in beating a dead horse.|`|OHfZFR31aa	forget the friend for now and just concentrate on yourself. If your girlfriend is not making you happy, then you have to end it with her. The longer you continue on, the harder it is going to be when you do dump her in the future, or even stay with her but cheat. You are being unfair staying with her if you don't see a long term future<br>  <br>  As for the other girl, it might work out but then again it might not. You may be attracted to her now because you know you can't have her. And if you knew her before you knew your girlfriend, why wasn't she your soulmate back then? <br>  <br>  Don't leave your girlfriend for another woman. Leave your girlfriend for your own mental health. And if you get together with the other girl, then that's fine. But that shouldn't be your only motivating factor or you are going to be very disappointed once reality sets in|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Staying with your girlfriend would definitely be a mistake because you'd both be in a relationship that his going nowhere.<br>  <br>  If you don't love her anymore, move on because you deserve to be happy too. People change as get older, it's part of life.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|OBCvewW2aa	Does the new girl have alcohol or drug problems?  No?  It'll never work.  Everybody knows co-dependants need to be with addicts and/or the desolate to feel better about themselves.  <br>  <br>  You'll be hurtin' if you leave your beautiful mess.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	As usual you are only thinking of leaving her cos you have another woman in the wings. Do her a favor and leave her, that way she can meet someone who wants her without him thinking of another woman.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	What is it with people? Why do you ask total strangers what you should do? If you're not happy with your girlfriend, get out....before starting a new relationship. You'll be doing yourself and your girlfriend a favor in the long run. Why lie to yourself or to her.|`|afI03mJXaa	I would say it sounds like you have made your decision already. You just want some sort of verification from others to make you feel better about it. So do what you have to do. If your not in love with her then there is no reason why you should be dragging her along and making her think things that aren't true. As for your friend, that is a big thing that you are planning on asking her out. The reason I say this is because she is your friend and once you cross that line things could change between you all forever. For the good or bad. You need to keep that in mind. I know you feel like she is your soul mate, but does she feel the same way? I think that these are things you should be thinking about before you go jumping into another relationship. Good Luck
IVxPMLnTaa	how about text her? but since you're just friends, u dont have to call her.|`|NZKiSfVOaa	yes she does. I would.  I would think you didnt like me if you didnt text/call, within a day or two of getting my number.  BUTTT  if you dont want it to lead anywhere and just want to be her friend, make sure you dont flirt with her, just ask her if she is ok, what shes up to, normal stuff you would talk to your guy friend with, other wise she may think your into her when your not and that would be bad.  but if you are into her, then just text her asking her how shes feeling, how far she got with a boy, if she thinks your hot, ect ect, flirt.|`|pjLtmjIiaa	she probably expect you to text her. But don't call without a reason.|`|y6v4ztM8aa	No se expects you to just sit on it. just text her or something. if u guys r just friends then yeah text or call her.|`|91gP6Xouaa	no she expects u to feed ur goat with her number (just kidding) start out with a text then if she seems interested call her and talk to her longer. but don't flirt, compliment her but don't flirt.|`|tS2BpqTiaa	well, if you got her number yah.  you should just call her but don't give her the idea that you want to go out.  just act like friends, and leave it clear to her that it's juts gonna be "just friends for now".|`|twSD9zHzaa	Text her but don't flirt. Maybe text her what was the math homework one night, and then after she answers say whats up? Its innocent but enough to keep her happy.|`|d0C8NfUhaa	Duh! call her as a friend and get to know each other if she doesnt wanna date, she might like you enough later to be more than friends. so call her and just chat about random stuff.|`|uRDdtM56aa	wait a few weeks and then one day call her and ask if she wants to h ang sometime.
RcVM06T3aa	Fun people also have a knack for bringing the people they're with into fun scenarios. Some of them just simply know good places to go and fun things to do. Others have this hard-to-pin-down ability to just get everyone they're involved with into crazy situations. Rather than make a normal response to a situation, they'll be a bit more spontaneous and unpredictable and get all their friends involved in something memorable.|`|RYvj4ex1aa	juss get rifd of being boring <br>  theres' no such thing as BOREDOM<br>  unless u dont have a life juss loosin up nd go out more often make more friends ..make plans get a boyfriend....nd go on frum ther...|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz snore....what?|`|AOpH80A3aa	do something dangerous but not illegal
0TGpz08paa	I spend about 100 $ a week on groceries. We are two adults and my 3 and a half year old daughter. I stick to a budget. I make a list of the necessities ( such as milk, meat, pasta noodles, fruits and vegetables ) and I use coupons and I look for the sales !! Groceries are expensive but my looking for the sales, it helps a lot !|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I spend about $100 too and there are only two of us, both old people.  I clip coupons and buy at discount grocery stores but we don't do without things we enjoy.|`|NDFN04sqaa	I average about $100/week - i do look for sales but not a huge coupon cutter.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	4 grown people in house hold.<br>  spend around $600-$700 a month
A3BoPYM0aa	say hi and stop creeping.<br>  duh|`|AA11280073	No, it is not creepy at all. It is normal. But don't stare for long periods. A quick glance is enough.|`|fFnfFROQaa	How about you stop daydreaming about her and ask her out?<br>  <br>  I think the staring part is that you yearn for her attention and affection, but you do not have the confidence to ask her out.<br>  <br>  I think that is the real issue there.<br>  <br>  Man up to her, get some confidence, ask her out and have a great time with her company. That will stop the lost puppy staring routine.|`|cLATPkjkaa	hahaha, sometimes girls laugh when they feel awkward xD<br>  <br>  Learn to tell the difference between the two types of laughs, and if they're laughing cuz of awkwardness, just back off for a couple of days.|`|8kh2jshLaa	just keep talking to her<br>  , she'll get to know you better and she wont think your a creep at all .|`|cZysB8O7aa	wow, you are a creepy stalker.|`|57Wnlfv7aa	take a next step and look at her as u wish maybe she<br>  ll recognize and u'll be able to express ur love to her just u need a step forward and try to be her friend and when u feel that she trusts you start talking to her about relationships and guys and know her way of thinking :D <br>  AND THAT'S NOT CREEP <br>  btw girls like guys who are attracted to them and EYES are the best WAY !!|`|RzZBU8elaa	what ever y9ou do. <br>  dont tell her you have feelings for her <br>  because women like to be kept guessing <br>  they dont want answeres right away<br>  just walk up to her every now and then and flirt with her<br>  especially since she obviously has accepted you close enough to her<br>  to make her laugh<br>  continue to flirt with her<br>  but DO NOT tell her you<br>  tha tyou sometiems stare at her<br>  you might just scare her away|`|wuAxaHihaa	As we all know, your in love. <br>  <br>  It's normal to look at somebody when you like somebody.

iPNOVR6Gaa	What's bizarre to me in this story is that you have been told, and you accept, that you are a cleanliness freak, but when you got married, you expected your husband to "improve".  You have it backwards.  It is the person with the neurosis who is obligated to try to improve, and that would be you.  You need to work on managing your anxiety in ways other than enforcing cleanliness, or else YOU are going to end up destroying your marriage.|`|KZlgdMeEaa	Every person has their good and bad qualities. In my experience its a matter of whether their good is enuf to accept the bad... in other words if he is a clutter freak but very loving and supportive which is more important?|`|NTUr0t3haa	Step one. Lower your expectations to rock bottom. He isn't neat, doesn't want to be neat, and will never do any cleaning or housework as long as you do it. He knows you will feel compelled do it, so why should he lift a finger. Lower expectations to zero.<br>  <br>  Step two. Hire a cleaning person. This will ease the resentment by magnitudes.<br>  <br>  Step three. Understand that the person with the higher standards is always going to be the one who carries out those standards. Also understand that passive-aggression is a very powerful force and you cannot overcome it, at least not without a lot of time and stress happening.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	First communications isnt always done with words. Some of the communication methods are actions. Doing nothing is a very strong communicator when done at the right time. As hard as this may be, doing nothing may actually be your best way to get thru to him. You are not his maid or mother so dont be one. Let the house get messy for a few days and when he asks why, tell him that youre tired of being his mommy or personal maid so either he helps or hires one. The message will get thru to him and things will change soon. You just have to know how to best communicate and when. Good luck|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Ha ha, I agree with you about communication not being all it's cracked up to be.  And I agree with your husband; if you want to clean then clean... but don't expect him to appreciate it.|`|herwbUsFaa	you are a maid ask to get paid and then put your 2 week notice in and find you a new man|`|4DDSD9Syaa	Communication sometimes do lead to an argument. My fiancee used to do that. I would just push his clothes on the floor to his side of the bed and let it pile up. I'll do the laundry if it's in the hamper, if not it will not get done. I told him on many occasions that I am not his mother, if he wants his mother then go. Cause you are a headache. I have kids to take care of and you're adding to my problem. I just stopped doing things for him. I tell him off all the time. And now living together for a year he has made drastic changes. It's also up to the man if he wants to change and make the relationship work out. You may need to ask him how bad does he want this relationship, and go from there.|`|84suLcJkaa	cheer up sweetie.  Life does go on.  my life is truly like yours. we share the anger, hurts, and disappointed.  But.. i love him very much.  i just ignore his attitude towards me. i wished one day he would do the same to me that i did to him. yes! the day did come.  he loves me more than i love him.  now we are happily married with 6 wonderful children.  in marriage u have to sacrifice sometimes. give and take, and win-win situations. always wish that your husband loves you so much that he would never even dream another women.  Slowly talk to him that you are not a superwomen.  Try to soft spoken to him and try find suitable time to communicate. Good luck.|`|AA10420452	well first off communication is not fighting unless you or him take it there.i have been married 26+ years to the same gal.we have our fights no two people can live together for a long period of time with out it. you have to decide what you will or will not take.i would start by not fixing his super. not washing his cloths and see how long it takes him to get off his you know what and do something for his self and while this is going on take time for yourself.|`|XSEWADI0aa	Ive been married 27 years, and I raised 6 kids, there all over 18, did you think being married was going to be easy? for one, dont have any kids, the work load will only get more intense. Second, if your both working, you should split the chores, sit and talk to your husband your his compliment not his slave. This is teamwork here. And if you plan on staying married 5 more months, dont nag, relax, pick one day out of the week to do major household chores and 1 hr after work a day to do simple ones, then take a nice hot bath have a glass of wine and enjoy each other, focus on the good things you have together, not the negative, they will tear your relationship apart..trust me try it, one more thing, if your looking for appreciation, go volunteer at a hospital|`|mldo1vxYaa	Your right this is childish bickering, you knew your husband was like that before you married him and you were in the wrong expecting him to change, you are not going to change being a clean freak so you cant expect him to change being a bit messy.<br>  <br>  Sorry but if you HAVE to have things clean all the time then you cant really expect him to do the same, you could ask him to help you with certain things and then you do the rest. Its a silly problem to allow to come between you and I find it surprising you say you cant even say you love him.<br>  <br>  I think its all being blown out of proportion, god forbid if someone came to you now and said he had been in an accident or something would you be worried about if the house was clean? Sometimes you just have to look at the bigger picture and accept people flaws and all.|`|GvamTVqAaa	You knew how he was before you married him, yet you chose to marry him anyway EXPECTING him to change.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Stop being his maid. Give him an ultimatum. Either he helps around the house or you leave him.
vG0tsqJtaa	He should tell you what he does.  Even if it was classified he could say I have a classified job with the government.|`|FzFSzilmaa	you aren't married to him, so stop asking... his choice to keep it secret...|`|YFXusnT1aa	Either he has a classified (government job) or he is a big time drug dealer
9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	There has to be some attraction in order to get a person attention. I do think that what's inside is more inportant. I could never date a really good looking guy that was a terrible person, but on the flip side if I'm not attracted at all to someone, I probably wouldn't give them a chance.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	Appearance helps and often makes a statement, but if you can see past the exterior and take time to get to know a person, you can love this person for the quality of character. :o)|`|ddP3klT3aa	For me its the inside that counts. It depends on how much weight though. If you are VERY over weight and just plain unhealthy, don't count on it. If you are a little heavier then normal then it shouldn't be a problem. I have dated heavy and skinny guys..I prefer heavier.|`|WCPqMcFNaa	The over weight thing is a total turn off for me. sorry because I know there are people out there who are not to blame for their weight. And in regards to the face  as older I realize more its not all about looks. <br>  Life is not a beauty composition, In life you same one who can make you happy, make smile and when it hard to be there for you.<br>  By the way I'm 21 so I'm not that old .lol|`|aNKqm0YIaa	The guy I like is average, I didnt think he was that hot at all at first but I love his personality so much that to me he is really hot now. All the other guys I liked before were pretty much average and even though my friend thought they were ugly they were still hot to me.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	If I liked her I would date her|`|K4ulbvUpaa	Well i'm not gonna lie, I have to have some kind of physical attraction to the guy, i have dated a few "ugly" guys that were one of the best guys i have ever been with, but i just couldn't really feel them on the level he wanted and i wanted to b/c i just didnt find him attractive. But i think back at times and wonder what if i couldve had that attraction i probably would've married Jay and been happily spoiled! LOL|`|vkDEE6eqaa	let me share something with you<br>  I met the guy that I might be in love with when I was kind of fat, I still wore glasses,  my sense of style was confusing, and he liked me for ME<br>  <br>  at first I was a little skeptical about it, but it's been a little over a year and he's been the only one for me (but no we are not together) and he has not found someone else...<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say ti all depends on how the guy is...<br>  <br>  I personally would not date a guy that had an ugly face...only because if I cant physically be attatched or attracted to you, then I don't know how a relationship can work out<br>  <br>  I have dated okay guys before...as a matter of fact, I have a guy that "loves" me...and he's actually pretty decent, but he's not my type...<br>  <br>  It's not being conceited or too stuck up, but you should not have to settle if you know you can get better...but then again, it's the personality that counts..<br>  <br>  so confusing lol|`|UOLtJocMaa	Um it depends on each guy, shallow or insecure guys wont date a bigger girl if they dont find it to be attractive.  IT is the inside that truly counts of course.  Like it depends how she carries the weight, I have seen some big women who were very pretty you know.  People just have preferences in general and some are less willing to settle for something outside of it.|`|2JzJDDEpaa	i think physical attraction is quite a big factor in interpersonal attraction and whether i would go ahead and date them....if im not sexually attracted to them, then they wouldnt be able to turn me on...and although sex isnt the main thing in a relationship, it still is a big part of it<br>  <br>  xxx|`|7KCNxW5Naa	In my opinion, It's what's inside that counts. My fiance is 300 lbs. But it's because she had an accident and ended up confined to the bed.<br>  <br>  If I didn't know that ahead or time, I honestly don't know if we would be engaged. I think we would though.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|C9QQPROkaa	I actually prefer heavy guys not like sloppy fat though. As far as looks he would at least have to have some cuteness about him but as long as he's nice he doesn't have to look like tom welling ( clark from small ville way hotter then tom cruise) or anything.|`|pVaZty4Maa	yeah i would give him a second thought but he has to have a damn good personality for me to think twice about him :)|`|NxZl1Qccaa	i would date him, i'm not shallow.|`|TanepNjdaa	Actually I have dated a guy that didn't look all that good but was a really nice guy. It turns out that it didnt work out. Not because he was all that attractive but he was TOO nice. I need to have a man with some sort of attraction to him otherwise I dont think I could be with him, but you can always learn to like a guy after already thinking that he dont look good.|`|VzXSC8fiaa	At first never. But as you get to know someone they become more attractive when they have a nice personality. You start to forget that they are ugly or fat lol.<br>  <br>  Same thing goes for a really attractive person who has a nasty personality, they start to become really unattractive. Well at least to me anyways.|`|HabNnEtDaa	Truthfully, no. and it’s not because I'm shallow or anything like that. I just believe that although you can hang out with someone that has a great personality there has to be at least a little attraction. If there was no attraction then we could only just be friends. I wouldn’t wanna try to get intimate with him then get repulsed whenever he touches me you know?|`|5tIyXnmfaa	Yes, I would.<br>  I love it when a guy treats me really nice. <br>  None of my boyfriends have been the best of lookers but they have been really committed, funny, charming and trustworthy. <br>  Aslong as they don't make you throw up everytime you look at them, which is only about 2% of the world population. <br>  <br>  x|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	Yes, it is the inside that really counts and yes i would date him. Spending the rest of the life with him....really depends on his personality and looks to a certain limit...i don't want either one of us to get hurt later.I don't want to regret too.This is my opinion.|`|Fulmgnmsaa	Ya the only things I look for in a guy are that he is a Christian person and that he is sweet. and has a good heart. I don't care if he is over weight my last BF was over weight but a good christian person he was so sweet too.|`|FBGYxNSDaa	The Battle of Anzen was fought in 838 at Anzen or Dazimon (now Dazmana, Turkey) between the Byzantine Empire and the forces of Caliph al-Mu'tasim. The Byzantines, led by Theophilus, were defeated by General Al-Afshin.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	the inside and how big he is also matters<br>  and by big i mean his belly|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	for me physical appearance is only the second priority , attitude is my first priority|`|RcVM06T3aa	id date her and probably try to help her with her weight.<br>  that would keep her healthy and me happy|`|6uYVRaebaa	no lol the relationship would get waaay boring if i wasn't phisically attracted to him|`|E3UX1SzWaa	this sounds shallow but really overweight. like 50 pounds. grosses me out.|`|Tlzzuuamaa	i mean if he's adding to the cash flow then yea!lmao
AA11447210	He's your boyfriend AND knows the bride so I don't see anything inappropriate about it at all. What a fun trip! It's no more inappropriate than if you took a good friend with you to share the fun and travel.    Go...have a good time! Italy is amazing! ?|`|RuKK1LYiaa	Its completely acceptable if she put +1 on the invitation, hes your other half and thats probably what she was hoping for, take him, have a blast and who knows it might be quite romantic for you and your man being in Italy for a wedding|`|lznoLTZCaa	Why on earth would it be inappropriate?|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	What if I said, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! Or I will LOVE YOU TO DEATH|`|KrgSnfXAaa	it depends on your bf. i just broke up with a girl because she wanted me to go to Amsterdam this summer for her birth day. I don't have money for that and it felt like she was putting too much pressure on me too soon. so if he has the time and the money it's cool. if not it could put him in an awkward position.|`|G7fqgUo3aa	Initially I would say it is kind of extravagant for a boyfriend of 5 mths, but since you've been friends for a while, plus he knows the bride..it wouldn't be too odd. If it was too costly for him, that may make him feel awkward. Other than that, what a beautiful place and you are only young once...live a little!|`|OaXsSAPdaa	OMG what an awesome wedding to go to! You must be so excited!!!!   Yeah invite him!|`|Jn4FkMRmaa	not inappropriate at all. However, an invitation to him doesn't necessarily mean he'll agree to go....for a variety of reasons.|`|QX3zn5Tqaa	I don't think it would be inappropriate, but who would pay for it all? If he agrees to go with you, then I would suggest you sit down together with a detailed list of who pays for what and you both sign it. Even though you have the best intentions, I'd hate to think of you ending up on Judge Judy over this.  If you are not comfortable enough with him to discuss money, then I would say that it's probably not a good idea to bring this up with him, unless you make it abundantly clear that your family is paying for everything.|`|AA11340375	Inappropriate,,,,,,,,,,,well not unless there is some other factor such as he is dead set against the marriage,you know he is unacceptable among your friends, etc. etc.    Costly---certainly !  A round trip air fare + lodging runs upwards of $ 5,000 which if you pay for it is less dear for him to foot, but if he has to pay then the wedding is a bust or it ends up in you breaking up then it would be downright painful.    Embarrassing---------Almost certain, for at least some one and at least one time----the expectation would be that you and he intend to wed one day, if the relationship is headed that way all well and good if not it may become a burdensome track (rut) to either follow or get out of !    I took a lady I felt strongly toward to a wedding of a family member and not only did they accuse her of theft at the wedding but she broke up with me a short time later!  The embarrassment lingers to this day and that was in 1975-----I am convinced she had absolutely nothing to do with the theft of medications from the medicine cabinet in my uncles home. I still reel when I think about it !!!    Should your feelings for the person be deep and you are convinced of a positive direction for the relationship this will serve to advance that tendency---AND THUS WILL LEAD TO ANTICIPATION ON THE PART OF THOSE ATTENDING !    Might it be simpler to skip the invite just write him a mushy letter from the wedding location stating ...."you should have seen....."!     Besides you just might find some cool dude at the wedding and he won't be in your way!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	I would not think so.|`|6eGZGEw4aa	No! If it doesn't against anything you're against, then it's ok.    What I mean is, if you don't do anything you would consider wrong, according to your morals and values, then it's fine.

The ex before him I don't necessarily trust him but we are friends now.<br>  <br>  If he is still talking to you and your friends then yeah I hope he trusts you.|`|QrQWQ1nraa	Yeah.  He was great to me.  I broke it off; but it was only because I decided to give God all of me.  He was not Christian.  (I think he still dislikes me for breaking it off with him; but i hope he understands!)|`|kzdGFDbFaa	i dont cause shes a jump and i easily made her break up with her old bf to get wit me she easy. i broke if off before some other dude try to get the goods.|`|Fulmgnmsaa	I think i know what you are talking about but this is not a really clear question.

KeDIU7pkaa	H-mm! Sounds pretty interesting. <br>  <br>      Coming from a guy's view, I'm sure he does, even if he doesn't say it.
kZ83nGsmaa	Been there, done that.  I don't care if you are coming into your own now or whatever you reason is.  You know that your fiancee and you are not meant to be, so take it easy on the guy and tell him it's over.  May be tough for him to understand now, but it's better than walking in on you and his friends later.  <br>  <br>  Oh and I would also let him know that his friends were saying you were hot and then take pictures of their faces and put another post up.<br>  <br>  I was with a girl that was a "model" and was hot and all of that crap.  The other poster was right about the fact that hot girls think, "either you give me all of the attention I require or I will get it from somewhere else."  Hey, it's not right, but everyone is different.  Whatever floats your boat!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	sorry I have dated some hotties in my time, the attitude they secretly have is If you don't make me happy I can get someone else just like that. The friends thing, would scare the crap out of me, no she isn't ready for marriage yet. enjoy the time you have with her, maybe she will change later, but that depends on you and how long your willing to wait for that time!!!|`|RLR0DOHFaa	Trust me!! I have been in a relationship like this before and she cheated on me with my best friend. We were 23 so it's not like THEY didn't know any better. If it's out in the open with you, i'm sure your friends have noticed the signs before as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	YES! my husband always wants sex, so we comprimise since i dont. He helps me more around the house and avoids yelling at me over stupid stuff and we have sex more. We use to do about 1x a wek now we do it 3x a wwek|`|5hxWSezPaa	Joe, I understand your predicament.  If you have bad habits change them for your own sake.  Your wife just will not have sex with you based on your prior question.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	No. I only have sex when I want to. It is not a reward for good behavior. He should quit his bad habit because it bothers me and threatens our relationship.|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	Hell no.<br>  <br>  He can sleep on the couch and live on cold cereal until he breaks his habit, and sex will STILL be on MY terms.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	More sex would probably kill my husband.  He's pretty much up to his neck in it as it is.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	Based on some of the things that bother me in my current relationship, I would say yes. It would be a good return on my investment ;-)|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	i have to answer...i am not your "typical medium or low-sex woman" but...i would do it!  at least a bj a day.....|`|H7UphlLCaa	no, but i'd make a deal to quit one of my bad habits.|`|xGshAiXOaa	No, I don't use sex as a bargaining chip.|`|W0KQTXrvaa	no i rather keep his bad habit thank you|`|sWKQGmiOaa	I think it is good idea to read:<br>  <br>  marriage: Jesus saying-<br>  1 Cor 6:7-7<br>  "It is good for a man not to marry, but sexual sin is a danger. So each man should have his own wife. And exch woman should have her own husband. The husband shouldgive his wife all that she should have as his wife. And the wife should give her husband all that he should have as her husband. The wife does not have power over her body. and the husband does not have power over his own body. His wife has the power over his body, Don't refuse to give your bodies to each other, But you might both agree to stay away from sex for a time. You might do this so that you can give your time to prayer. Then come together. This is so that Satan (the devil) can't tempt you in your weakness. I say this to give you permission to be separated for a time. It is not a command. I wish all people were like me. But each person has his own gift from God . One person has one gift, another person has another gift. <br>  <br>  Romans 1:24<br>  <br>  People are full of SIN, wanting only to do evil things. So God left them and let them go their sinful way, and so they became fill of sexual sins, using their bodies wrongly with each other. <br>  <br>  Romans 1:26<br>  Because people did those things. God left them let them do the shameful things they want ed to do. Women stopped having natural sex with men. They started having sex with other women. In the same way, men stopped having natural sex with women. The men began wanting each other all the time. Men did shameful things with other men. And in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrong things they did.<br>  ......................................... on and read!|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Joe bargaining isnt the way to get sex.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	How would that benefit me?

It is their (wives) right to control everything we wish to do.  I think it is in the fine print on all marriage license.  I have read the damn thing three times and have not found the fine print, but I know it's there somewhere, because all my wives have had this in common.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Would you prefer her to say, "I like sex, I want sex, and I enjoy sex, but I just don't want to have it with you."|`|tsBL19qzaa	Why stay with her? She sounds like a person who is just passing through your life.|`|5hxWSezPaa	You are married to a nasty, horrible woman,  I say you should divorce her.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	I think she's trying to tell you something.............|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	sounds like she doesn't really love you.

He always says he never gets sex either.<br>  Is this Mustafah?!!<br>  <br>  But anyways Joe,  I kinda think your wife either doesn't like you like that, is a lesbian, or is having an affair.  It's just too weird that she always always comes up with excuses, and never really tells you how she feels.  How does she act towards you during the times that you're together for dinner, or those dates or vacations??  I think that's important.  If she's always cold towards you, what is the point in being married to her?!  I'm sorry, but you could have a much more fulfilling and close (and sexual!) relationship with someone who actually wants YOU!<br>  I don't mean to be harsh, but this sounds incredibly sad.  You shouldn't just keep waiting for her to come around.  If she hasn't already she probably won't.<br>  -Leah|`|AA10420452	i would tell her if she wanted to be in this relationship she has to get it together or your stepping out to.get it and you can just live together.if that don't work move on life is to short to be unloved.

You say in your title you quit drinking, yet in the statement that follows you say, you don't drink Much anymore.  So which is it?  I am a smoker, and personally I would advise people not to smoke.  I have tried to quit many times, it is hard too do.  So you if you have given up drinking ...way to go...now stop smoking...you will live longer, clothes won't smell, and you will be richer.  I heard the price of cigs is going up 60 cents a pack come April.|`|xGshAiXOaa	I've never heard of any accidents involving 'smoking and driving'.  So I'd have to say smoking is the safer alternative.  Then again, I do both but if I had to pick one or the other, smoking for sure.  Smoking doesn't make me unable to control myself, my ability to drive, my decision making skills, doesn't make me pass out, wake up with a hangover, etc.|`|WJt2efKWaa	You shouldn't have to hide anything from someone that you love.  Is it possible that you just go overboard when you drink?  Maybe if you slowed down a bit and just drank a little once in a while, she wouldn't have an issue with it.  Chances are she doesn't like the person you become once you've had too many.  Try to set limits for yourself and understand that when we do drink, our attitude and mindset change completely.|`|e998f43290bce8e67776ac5462e5fdc5aa	how about neither? im sure your wife is concerned about your health, exchanging liver cancer for lung cancer wasn't the smartest decision. i understand that u needed something to calm u down but try natural things like deep breaths or running. these things are healthy for you. try talking to your wife and being honest because that is going to lay a good foundation for your relationship. try focusing on healthy behaviors during stressful or difficult situations where u crave alcohol or a cigarrette.|`|0imjbygmaa	Eww that's worse. Why don't you get a better habit that would involve something between you and your wife? Maybe something she could really appreciate.

(probably not though) who knows!  you may get lucky soon!|`|UnqAjpVOaa	To be honest, both of the habits are as bad as each other. Neither one is worse or better.

I'd give up all three and get a life.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	just drink a little and avoid smoking|`|7bIrMvziaa	Both are bad|`|GcIhgY1gaa	hell no !!!!!!|`|Ks1uiHReaa	lol|`|QIQNzE11aa	Congrats on not drinking so much. I'd say get off the cigs too. No reason in killing off your health. For best stress relief try masturbating twice a day instead. You'll be less stressed, feel happier and healthier! <br>  <br>  I think it's time you took your wife to marriage counseling and see why she isn't interested in sex. Sexual activity is the easiest way to see if a marriage is good or not. A good marriage has an active sex life in it. <br>  <br>  Many women internalize things far too much and many people haven't a clue as to how to communicate properly or how to start to solve the problems at hand. A counselor can help you in that area. <br>  <br>  It's always harder to give up vise when you are doing it for another person, you really should give up all that for you. If you stopped hiding behind substances you might start to find ways to fix the problems at hand.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	yeah, go back to drinking, smoking is a lot worse.<br>  <br>  Especially if you have kids around|`|QMAqzpKEaa	Try meditation and give up smoking. I don't drink much but I smoke and it's a nasty habit and hard to give up. Also, she will find out some time. <br>  Meditation might rovide you with that release you are looking. Also, try more sex with your wife. It might take your mind off the cigs.|`|el8yX5q3aa	one addiction for another.. You have an addictive personality....you will always be addicted to something unless you find out why.  You will just trade one for the other....|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Both carry risks but drinking heavily carries more risks. I would let your wife know that you are smoking be honest with her. Good Luck!|`|tEI2wdVRaa	smoking is a hell of a lot worse.
XUSq0gHoaa	She is taking advantage of you and your fiance! I was in the same situation a week ago. My fiance's brother was living with us because he left his moms house, they had an argument blah blah blah...... So, My fiance told him he could stay so he wouldn't have to drop out of high school and loose his job. Well, it didnt quite work, he was messy, not organized, he would eat all of our food, he didnt pay rent or bills or food, he didnt shower ofter and there were pubic hairs all over the shower once he got out, he didnt clean, and to top it off he would play video games all day and night untill like 3 or 4 in the morning and wouldnt go to school the next day (and that was like 3 to 4 times a week) oh and he would invite the gf over and spend the night and the list keeps on going. Well, my fiance and I got so fed up with it that we asked for him to leave, and let me tell you we asked him to leave about two months before he actually left. It was difficult and upseting, but my fiace and I almost ended our  relationship because of it. Its tough out there and they need to realize that sooner or later. Give her an ultimatum and if she doesnt get it then kick her out because there is not use in you helping her to do something for you herself to suceed in life when is not willing to do it anything to help herself. Now, asnwer this, is all of this trouble worth going through when you are unhappy? tell her to go before your relationship with her gets any worse.|`|707gOCvbaa	Put her out and NOW. Sometimes our own family can be our worst enemy. You have over extended yourself and she still takes advantage of you not to mention seems to want to ruin your relationship. She will either learn from her mistakes or become a complete mess but it's her life and her own path. Would you accept that behavior from your own child? NO I doubt it. Put her out and do not let her back in. Let your parents deal with her. She's spoiled and i'm sure they should take some blame.|`|TJezsCkHaa	looks like that she is not respecting you and the efforts that you have been doing to provide her a place to stay in to succeed in life.Put her stuff in a garbage bag and through it out the door.She doesn't deserve to be around you plus ruining your life.|`|YIeXrfBKaa	Push her out of the nest. She makes it or she doesn't, but the choice is hers. "Babying" her is not the way to make her grow up.|`|7NqIVXIlaa	You need to sit down with her and tell her the rules again. Tell her if she doesn't start to follow them then you have no choice but to kick her out. Let her know that is not what you won't to do but you will if things don't start to change. She is 18 and needs to grow up. Let her know you love her but you  can't deal with the way she is acting you did something nice for her by letting her move in with you. And all she does is disrespects you and your fiance and the rules you have set for her in your house.|`|qKA05EQTaa	you cannot let this person disrupt your life. Give her one more week to stop the behavior, make a contract and have her sighn it , if she violates it then tell her she has 1 week to get out. maybee she can roomate with someone. You have to give her tough love. when you cator to her it is not helping her you are not giving her a gift , the gift you can give is to make her stand on her own 2 feet and find the maturity and confidence to do these things on her own, I worked 2 jobs had a daughter and went to college. so it CAN BE DONE! believe me it was hard but i did it and so can she. it really is for her own good. If she straightens up and stays then you can make a deal with your ma to send you the rent directly. you need to look out for yourself .|`|n7lUU63Saa	you know what, sit down with her and tell her that if she doesn't do what you tell her to do kick her out of the house.

I think girls with glasses are cute and i like someone who kind of wears glasses and she is amazingly beautiful.|`|6dHIoJLVaa	stylish ones are cute, big round ones are ugly.|`|tqw9AyApaa	well i am in 9th grade i like glasses on girls as long as they were nice clothes with them|`|WbbwpeSGaa	as long as they look good why not?|`|EGLH7Aoiaa	It depends what kind of glasses.|`|Xify43Taaa	i think that girls who wear them look cute to me because it make them look smart.|`|feUMAvgLaa	It depends, some girls can look great with glasses|`|Y8fDJcekaa	if you care that much what they think, get contacts!|`|l27zURMnaa	really? if they bother you that much you can wear contacts.  or consider the eye surgery in a few years.
xarKlp0Oaa	My sister chose to do this too. She makes $900.00 per kid and she has 3 right now. When the kids leave and go back to their families that income is lost but She always ends up getiing more kids. You should do just fine but I understand it is normal to have these concerns. You are a good person to want to help children. We need more people like you.
Nk876YgJaa	I wish guardians and parents would both realize that forcing kids to go to a church they do not want to go to... really pushes them away from god.<br>  On top of that, do not feel guilty about saying "I don't know". You shouldn't feel like you owe her an explanation for everything you do. Girl, you have had it hard, and you should be proud of yourself for making it as far as you have. <br>  Also, Her talking on the phone about you loud enough for you to hear was immature..  What was her point? Shes a full grown adult being degrading to a teenage girl? She should feel bad about herself, and she is the one with the problem here.<br>  I also had my fair share of issues when I was 15. Counseling helped a lot, but I was only in it because my school had group counseling that was free. <br>  If I were you I might mention that you heard her, and that YOU CAN TALK, but sometimes you don't know the best way to say how you feel without her thinking poorly of it. Its better to say I DON'T KNOW, than to portray something you aren't feeling, and have her think less of you. <br>  Girl I feel for you. I know its hard to say what you feel to someone who is so critical of everything you do. She sounds judgmental. When you are 18 go to college, and get away from her.|`|RYvj4ex1aa	awww email me itthe same thing that happened to you im goin through the same thing juss that i am 16 email me if u wanna be friends i am in the same relation as you are .....|`|YIeXrfBKaa	You've been through a very difficult time; my heart goes out to you. You may have to let down some of your defenses and let you Aunt and Uncle know how you actually feel. Most children are not into religion - it's a drag for them, but religion can be comforting. Open yourself up to the possibilities. You don't say whether they have children of their own, but whatever the situation, I have to believe they are looking after your best interests. As to the bad stuff she said, think it over in your mind. Was it actually bad or was it simply true? You are far from stupid; you put your feeling into words very well, but perhaps you need to put those thoughts into words. Sit down and talk to your Aunt and Uncle. I have the feeling they love you deeply but do not know you because you won't let them.|`|t1VthewCaa	Seems like church is the best place for you then. Just look at it as a blessing in disguise! You don't like church, but if you pray and ask God to help you with your situation at your home and your self-esteem when being approached by your guardians, it'll all get better soon. By the way, you do not sound like a stupid, young girl. You sound like any other 15 year old young lady who is dealing with issues in her life just like the rest of us. I was 15 once and it was definitely a trying time for me as well. I was taken away from my mom and moved in with my dad and step-mom who were adamant Christians (my dad's a pastor). I didn't like my step-mom and my dad just seemed to have went along to get along! I finally started to grasp the entire concept of church and life itself. God sacrificed his only son for me and you, so of course I live in sin everyday, but I always ask myself...what have I done for Him (God) lately. I am now 21, and I don't think I could have done anything better than get to know God personally. Try it and pray on your conditions at home and in life. If you stand for God, who can make you fall and stay down! No one! So, keep your head up. Trouble doesn't last always, so just remeber that, live by it!|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	e-mail me if u need someone to talk with sometime.|`|2S2onP86aa	Nah, you are not a stupid young girl. Everyone would be upset when they hear someone talking bad about them.<br>  Just try to express your feelings next time, and speak your mind. There is nothing to be afraid of. I promise you will be fine. <br>  <br>  Cheer up, xoxo. Muah.|`|n8nhjmfraa	aww im so sorry to hear about your loss.<br>  you should tell her that you know she is talking about you and ask her to stop because it makes you feel bad and you are already going through a difficult time<br>  cheer up and go have fun with some friends that always makes me happy|`|bbWICoxsaa	honestly naw u not a stupid yung gurl...bt i feel u kauz im in sumwat of a situation like urz...my parents like oversea..bt im hea..living w ma aunt n i say idk to thingz she ask me 2..i undrstnd yo pain on going to church kauz im not dat big of a fan bt she mke sure i go w her er sunday...bt all u got to do is think positive, try to do sumting to gt yo mind off the thingz yo aunt say, find a close frnd to tlk to, n basically jus focus on gtting up n out her place wen u 18..so u wont hve to b dealing w alot of stff..kauz u gne go to church jus nt az oftn..n ask her to trust u at times were u feel she's too strict n ur trying to do something or go sumwer........i no u prolly thinkin she dnt no wat im going thru n nt undrstnding clearly bt i atleast hope dat u gt thru to sum of wat im saying|`|bo4MguzVaa	The following excerpts are actual answers given on history tests and in Sunday school quizzes by children between 5th and 6th grade ages in Ohio.

Making out is not about trying to eat your partners face out so dont go all animalistic on her, make the kiss gentle, she should like that.    Dont start moving your tongue all around her mouth and against her teeth, you should basically just "caress" her tongue with yours.    Try no to hit her teeth with yours.    She might like it if you put a hand on the cack of her head and one at her waist to bring her closer to you (gently!!)    Dont forget to close your eyes!    If this is your first kiss dont you dare go to second base!    I think thats pretty much all the adviseI can give you. Dont think about it too much, just feel it (in your heart) and let yourself go. Try not to be too self concious.

If she says no, she is not intersted and youve saved face. but if she says yes, you take the chance and tell her you want to try again if she's willing.|`|McjaM0hDaa	yes you should tell her how you feel. and yea for some girls you did say the wrong thing. and the next time she tells you about a friend be happy for her!!!! good luck!!|`|Y8fDJcekaa	write her a note....it will show you cared enough to take the time to do so|`|fma8N2VEaa	i would|`|Jr9j5f6naa	yes. say that you want to give it another try because distance isnt really a problem anymore    ...probably be better by calling her, though.|`|27MRNeH4aa	If you want her back then go for it!  She was trying to get you jealous a bit and maybe see if you cared about her still by mentioning another guy.  She must still like you.  Tell her how you feel and get back together!|`|mxVq4mOeaa	maybe when she txted you that she wanted to see what you would say.. if you would get upset becasue maybe it was a boy.. maybe she has stopped talking to you becasue she thinks that you dont like her anymore. talk to her.. and tell her how you feel|`|jUXzm8u9aa	Yes, tell her how you feel. Maybe talk to her in person.|`|pwcEvd4taa	umm dont worry youll get her bak just show her u really want her bak and impress her n stuff yes u should tell her how u feel n im pretty sure wen u tell her how u feel she'll understand whats going on. just keep in  touch with her alot. =)|`|PSBHeDGMaa	yea.definately. espesially as u said she has low self esteem. make her feel good about herself or if that dosent wash wuth her u cud try tellin her of a "friend" that u got and c how she reacts?id go with the 1st 1 tho.....|`|WbbwpeSGaa	YES|`|zc7xneuOaa	She's trying to get your attention.  She's also trying to make you jealous.  Text her right now and tell her exactly how you feel!  It'll be the best thing you ever do.|`|Y9hBknBuaa	u called her Hun? that's probably the problem.Shes like"okayyy?"|`|Ri7ESS6paa	She probably didnt text you back because she was busy doing something else.|`|kzJm7bOyaa	Just ask her if you did anything wrong and also yes do tell her how you feel.  U should call her instead of texting.|`|iI36w7wVaa	No, you should not.  Stop for a moment and think about this.  Is she really that important to you? Is she really soul mate material? You say you just  got your license? You must be 16 or 17, right?    You are too young to understand what you truly want. Experience more girls, go out with girls. High school is finding out what you want, not so much WHO you want.  I know from experience.  I met the girl of my dreams in college and I've been with her for 2 years last week.  I know how much I love her only because of the experiences I had in high school.    If you are truly meant to be with this girl, give it time.  If she's always being childish and if she might get upset because you called her "hun," then she is definitely not what you want.  Give it time.  Time is the most important thing to apply to these types of situations because later on when you've locked yourself to one person, you have all the time in the world to be all about them and only them.  You don't want to mess up.  That person, who you spend your whole life with has to be the most wonderful person in the world.  Believe me, you don't want to rush back into this.  It hasn't been long enough.|`|ATqWlp8aaa	First of all stop making accusations of low self esteem just to excuse childish behaviour. Obviously she has found some one more suited to her childish antics and has forgotten about you. Don't want to be harsh but if its been three weeks, man you have to move on. How ever if you don't want to take such a quick course of action, I suggest texting her a simple uncomplicated message of your feelings towards her. If she agrees on getting back together congrats! If not then you can not say that you didn't try.|`|6WEyDIDxaa	of course text her,she,s probably only talking about her new friend to make you jealous and you texting good stuff hun makes her think you dont care|`|0cmfQqMEaa	try texting her again maybe she didnt get it|`|IgWqIdZPaa	play it cool. by all means text her, call her even, but as a friend, try to find out how she is. how school-work- life in general is going. try and find out how she feels and play off of that. it might be that this 'new friend' of hers is now her 'boyfriend' and thats why she has not texted you in a while. you don't want to put yourself out there without knowing the full story. you might make things worse. good luck.
Ps0tDYBAaa	either that or shes a crazy ******.you could report her to your supervisor that she is harassing you, that way she'll get fired and you don't have to ponder this dilemma anymore.|`|KeDIU7pkaa	H-mm! Interesting Question! Well, here's the thing. If it's love, It's bittersweet.|`|bxBCzoCoaa	No sorry hun, the whole mean to boys if u  like them thing ended in elementary school. She does not like you.|`|GowsmaOAaa	Lol yes she does!
AvmKTcJNaa	First off I want to tell you that I'm very sorry. I too have been there and I can understand how painful it is. Especially when you have only the feeling but no definite prof of cheating. If you find out she is, believe me, the feeling doesn't get any better at first.<br>  <br>  Here is on way I found out. Now of these days people can cheat more easily due to all of our technology. And that's what most of the unfaithful do. I used this very thing to find out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cheaterchecker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaterchecker.com/</a><br>  <br>  They have a free trial that can help you. It allows you see everything that goes on on the computer. EVERYTHING! even what they type and who they type it to. You can only get somethings on free trial, like a small screen shot of the computer.<br>  <br>  I do NOT agree with the use of this software. It is an invasion of propels privacy. I just want you to see all your options. And I'm just answering your question "how to find out without getting caught". Whether I agree or not.<br>  <br>  If she is not cheating then maybe you should find out why you felt that way and discus it with her. If you plan to spy on her keep in mind if you want a healthy relationship with her you will need to tell her; If you plan on staying or not.<br>  <br>  I just want you to know... the feeling will fade with time. And you can find someone who will make you happy and be truthful. I have.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry for your situation and I hope the best for you. Good luck.|`|ZCqohQCMaa	Somehow, get the cell phone. Lik when you're with her and she goes to the bathroom or something be like: Let me hold your thing so its easier for  you. When she says ok. Get the cell phone. <br>  <br>  Another way is the friends. Get one of her friends to open up to you and tell you what she knows. A mutual friend. Since, its a mutual friend, ask the firend to pry a little bit. (this you may not want to do becuase  this friend might tell the gf what you want her to do)<br>  <br>  Get a guy friend of yours (that your gf doesnt know) to flirt with her and see what she does. If she says, "I have a bf" have him ask her something about the bf that would relate to you.<br>  <br>  Finally, trust is a main part of a relationship. What you really need to do is talk to her directly. Tell her that you feel as if things arent quite right and you would like to ask her about some things. Don't accuse her of anything, otherwise she will deny it and get mad. Explain to her that you feel worried and hurt and upset. <br>  Or, you could do something extremely sweet for her that no one else will ever do. Usually when this happens the girl will feel really bad for cheating in the first place and start crying right there and...there ya go<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|b7f19cbc9f39fdb1b91876b5ca0e7fbbaa	Trust is the key to a relationship and if you suspect cheating there is a reason for it.

zxQT3Uo5aa	Good point on the mom's part and so true.  However, since he has already married, mom can choose to withdraw her support but she can not make him get a divorce.  <br>  <br>  There are consequences to our choices and not all of them within our control.  Does it suprise you that parents have options, too?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	How did his mom find his "stuff" if he isn't living with them?  And where is he living if he can't support himself?<br>  <br>  His mom is trying to control him and she doesn't have a legal leg to stand on BUT she can probably manipulate the family into supporting her and shunning her son.  Not a very nice thing to do but perfectly legal.  I think if he's legally old enough to get married, he's old enough to bear the consequences some of which might mean, he's on the outs with the family and will have to find other means of support.|`|TJezsCkHaa	if he decided he wants to be married,he should be able to be financially independent so no one can tell him do this and not that.Let him be away from her and try to find a good job to support himself and his wife.|`|UO2R7Oruaa	Hard to tell. He was wrong not to inform his mom before getting married. And also like you said they are in love, the mom should let them be but again, we don't know the details so not sure who is right or wrong.|`|z9st8cLvaa	I have to agree with the mom.  Your friend shouldn't have gotten married if he couldn't support himself and his wife on his own.|`|YFXusnT1aa	No he has his own family ignore her for a bit she will calm down|`|YIeXrfBKaa	Parents have the right to let you know where they stand on an issue. It is not necessarily a "threat" to let someone know they are henceforth on their own. A married man SHOULD be on his own and not dependent on anyone for support. He should be in the position to do the supporting. If the spouse works and they have the agreement that all monies will be pooled for the common good, fine. If she is in it for the citizenship, he will find out soon enough. Just because a person is old enough to make their own decisions does not mean they will be good decisions.|`|qqSMCeaqaa	i agree with the mom. if they are really in love they can wait. they should get a divorce and wait until he can support himself and his wife. then get remarried. they should have talked to their parents and should have come to this solution first.|`|fLwiQ1Uraa	there was a good reason why he didnt tell his mom, in my opinion i think the parents should support there children no matter what, always be there for them and love them UNCONDITIONALLY !!|`|qr16GzNnaa	If that is true it is his decision not his mother once he is of age to do so.
LLeQyWGcaa	i would say a little of both, until the kids have shown to their parents they are responsible and trustworthy. having your kids trust and knowing they will make right decisions when certain cituations arrise is wonderful for a parent to have. with this they can be more lenient and allow them to do more and more things on their own.
WI1Mz9YTaa	don't worry about the economy, people in high school and freshmen in college are the luckiest! the economy will get back together in 2 to 3 years max, it's a recession and it will eventually get better. so by the time you graduate, demand for jobs will peak.<br>  you need to benefit of that fact to prepare yourself really well and have a good background to be able to get a good job when those become available.<br>  Do your GED, go to a two year community college cause 1. it's easier to get in and 2. it's cheaper. Get SUPER good grades, it's really not hard in a community college and then try to transfer to a top school with scholorship, and even if you don't get one, at least you'll have loans for a two year tuition instead of 4.<br>  Don't give up but have your goals straigthen. You know what you do not want and that's a good first step, now you need to work on what you want.<br>  And don't let anyone around you (family or friends) affect or de-motivate you! Good luck!|`|EmRvvesHaa	well something quick? work at a grocery store they will always hire, and in the long run, you should try to get your G.E.D. or even try to go back to school next year. You've seen what a lack of education has done for you siblings, this should be motivation to want to be better. Dont worry, you are young and still have time to do anything, just make the right choices and have faith.|`|uz3VBN0Zaa	just read what you wrote and and you will get the answer...if you cant go to high school try to work on a g.e.d the equivalent to high school diploma.... it sound like your lazy any way if you don't get at least a high school diploma it will be very hard for you to get a good job...do not follow you brothers path make your own path  and don't be lazy taking short cuts...you can do it man... give your self an opportunity to be success full. at your age every thing seams to be hard...|`|XLHgiBApaa	Please go back to school.  It is hard to qualify for many jobs without a high school diploma..  Rather than sitting at home bored.....try adult school.....or GED program.  There is also homeschool.  You are still a kid....you have seen how great your brothers turned out.  If you want to be the one that becomes a man that can stand on his own feet and support himself.  You are going to need an education.  After  you finish that you should consider going to college.  Or getting a civil service job...like a postal worker, or a fireman, a court house clerk.  They can make 50,000 or more a year and receive full benefits.  There are lots of opportunities out there.  Please don't quit now.|`|Z1UNkTYRaa	Take a piece of paper and draw your own self with the help of pencil.

Zz1HI5VHaa	Life with step parents can feel stressful. Often times we feel unloved by the step parent. Most of the time communication is the root of the problem. A few possible reasons she may be snapping at you (I am not condoning her behavior, just speculating as to where it may be coming from) Are you younger or older than her kids. If you are older, she may feel the same way about her kids touching the baby but feels they are to young to understand her desires about them not touching the baby. If you are younger than her kids she may simply feel more comfortable with an older child being near the baby. (A lot of age issues there.) I also am assuming she does not mean to be rude to you. My mother snaps at everyone. now that I am 30 I realize it is not just me. When she starts yelling I quietly interupt her and ask if she realizes she is yellling at me. Usually her response is no and then she continues the conversation in a more normal fashion. <br>  <br>  No matter what the reason for your step mom being rude, well it is not good for your relationship. <br>  <br>  ignore all the people who are telling you to move out. That only teaches you to run from your problems. unless your Dad or Step mom are actually abusive in some way you should try to work this out. <br>  <br>  Maybe tell your dad that you would like to talk to him. Explain to him how your step mom is making you feel. be prepared for him to bring her in on this conversation. Do not get defensive, do not yell. Think ahead of time of the different points you would like to make. be prepared to listen. Not just with your ears but your mind. Trully hear what your dad and step mom have to say. I am sure they will be impressed with your maturity and you might just get a good relationship with your step mom out of the deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11280073	Talk to your father about it.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	play with the baby infront of your father ... if she still yells and your dad doesnt help you then go and live with your mom|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Are they somehow cleaner than you in her eyes?Sounds like she has something against you two because you weren't born of her.You should talk to your dad and maybe he will confront her about it.The baby is your half sister(or brother,you didn't say)and she needs to get used to that fact.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Put your cellphone on your hip call your dads number, " by Accident"<br>  Approach the baby and let him hear her reaction..<br>  It's your family too.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless.|`|pwCUXz6Oaa	TEL UR DAD WHAT U TOLD US AND ASK HIM TO TRY AND FIX THE PROBLEM|`|1Z4XGmWbaa	Unfortunately some step moms are just mean and rude. My dad has a second wife and she is rude and disrespects us. I advice that you talk to your dad about the situation. As long as you're not doing anything wrong and hurting anyone then she should give you and your sibling respect. You were a part of your dad's life before she even married him and need to learn to accept that. Just try to be on the positive and hope things get better. There are some stepmoms, second wives who are nice to their new partners family :)|`|HtyaefiXaa	....Umm..answering a question on here isn't the best way. Add me on yahoo messenger and we can talk about it more or here : Well, you can try living with your mom and if you don't like her or your dad....or your family life......try living with another relative...or.....a foster home?|`|EvpoKO4Jaa	i can relate to how you feel i have a stepmom who does the same thing except its with money lol anyway you have to talk to your father about it ..this kinda behaviour is simply unacceptable|`|qqSMCeaqaa	she sounds like a total *****. go talk to your dad or live somewhere else and make your dad realize shes horrible.|`|mMfWgm38aa	Go live with your mom or grandparents.
bO2rzfISaa	Don't call the police; you're in violation of the order, too.  Maybe you should ask an attorney.|`|AA12198711	Which accusation is true?<br>  <br>  You need to contact a Lawyer and ask for legal advice.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	I would let the police know that she is bringing the kids to you even though she has this PO against you  just to keep yourself out of trouble|`|bUqN9eh0aa	yes that makes the protective order void.
QOzAkOSUaa	act confident and mysterious. Even if you want him too you cant look too desperate or easy. Say something like "you wish". It may feel mean but guys love the whole playing hard to get thing.|`|rYhm4LN1aa	cheese
JICj8Lofaa	It's completely up to you. Just because the ring has a diamond does not mean it's an engagement ring.  If you want to propose to him, and you think he wouldn't feel threatened or uncomfortable, then go for it! But if you want this to be a promise ring, then that's a good idea too! Again, just because it's a diamond doesn't mean it has to be an engagement ring - it's the proposal that make it an engagement ring. Some engagement rings don't have diamonds in them, and some non-engagement rings do.    This ring is exactly what you make of it, so you just need to figure out how you'll give it to him. :-) Good luck.|`|AA10722993	Men don't wear engagement rings.   And you should let HIM do the proposing.  I am all for women being equal, but men should still pop the question.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	What if I said, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

DqetlSB6aa	out of those i like  2|`|4lL34wJnaa	Number 2 definitely seems to go the best with your dress of the choices you have given.    I actually went with my bridesmaids this afternoon and picked out the dresses for my outdoor morning wedding in July 2009.  We chose this dress in Tahiti Blue (bottom row of colors available, 3rd from left):  http://www.jasminebridal.com/J_2_1_1_1.a...    My dress looks like this, but is diamond white and light gold instead of white on white:  http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...|`|2GfdpBKuaa	I like   1|`|aBpEPOCdaa	Love your colours..love your dress (congrats by the way)    My personal preference is dress number 1 and I love the colour, it would be a very nice contrast to the flowers.    I think it would make everthing just pop.  Good luck to you.|`|kQnEvrIRaa	I personally do not like strapless.  The colors are all good except the pink.|`|hMavMBo4aa	I would pick 2 or 3.  1 is too fancy to go with your wedding dress.    As to which one..what time is your wedding?  I had an 11am wedding, and I had tea-length bridesmaid dresses.  Tea-length is nice, because it eliminates a $100 hem fee :)|`|w1necKzYaa	I don't like any of them including your dress! sorry but my opinion|`|UiQ6V377aa	Both dress 1 and 2 are beautiful. However Dress 3(mislabeled dress 2 again)is short,and unless you are having the wedding in summer outside I don't suggest a short dress. I think the first 2 dresses would compliment YOUR wedding dress nicely!|`|jzAAzAbjaa	Dress 1 or 3 would look great next to your dress. Your dress is beautiful by the way!|`|4IFXHz80aa	i like  1 in the color that it is in. plus if you need it shorter, you could always get them hemmed.|`|gli7SbBoaa	Of those I like the second one.  The third is better than the first but also looks too constricting.|`|0eJFtxnHaa	I like the first one better, it goes well with your dress.|`|12ORrojXaa	first of all your gown in gorgeous!  i think that the second dress compliments your gown the best.  also, i think it will look nice on different body styles/sizes....you want to make sure that all of your bridesmaids are comfortable!  from everything you described it should be a beautiful wedding!    best wishes!|`|NW3tKobLaa	i vote  2  because  1, is too flashy, it's YOUR day...   3 seems a little too casual  but you have AMAZING taste!!!!!!  your gown is phenomenal|`|Su0LaNhoaa	i think they are all ugly...no offense but they are just such stereotypical bridesmaids dresses...be original|`|mL3sMrtNaa	2!!!!|`|G7fqgUo3aa	Definitely love  2 (long version), to be similar to your dress. It is beautiful, simple and classy.|`|bJ1jC8Xraa	i like dress 3|`|lznoLTZCaa	the last one|`|sEDGYy03aa	I like dress   2.  The ribbon around the waist on dress   1 is too high and I don't care for short dresses like dress   3.    Your color are very beautiful.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	 2, your dress is too elegant and soft to let your bridesmaids wear a heavy fabric like taffeta (which is what number one is made of) and your dress is too formal too put them in short dresses.|`|394fe63adc8f8eedd899463e023848c6aa	i like  1 the most.  your dress is lovely.  here are some links to some nice light blue dresses:  http://www.bestbridalprices.com/bari-jay...  http://www.bestbridalprices.com/bari-jay...  http://www.bestbridalprices.com/bari-jay...    congrats and best of luck!|`|ii3sdyPjaa	I would go with number two, it's very pretty and clean and simple looking. It complements your dress wonderfully, which by the way is GORGEOUS! Seriously, I love it, it's amazing, so classic and unique. Who's it by? It's definitely high end... Melissa Sweet???|`|C3552Zjbaa	First of all congrats. I love the wedding dress. It's unusually. I love   2 . I think that the 1st one wouldn't really work. I personally wouldn't do a short dress for a bridesmaid. But that just me talking. Good luck.
ZZM8S7yCaa	talk to her. no one online can tell you what she's thinking or what will happen in the future.  get off the computer, go to your car, drive over to her and see her.|`|WkdW04cNaa	It doesn't matter what she would do, what matters is what you are going to do.  Why is she mad at you?  It's a little confusing.......If you are in love with this woman, I think you need to let her know somehow...........make it clear that you miss her and love her and if she is willing to forgive, she will, if not, you know you tried.
H9AlDTZOaa	id be like wow i coulda had that studly man|`|mqucJZSUaa	i would become sad, and i would be angry at myself for not seeing the truth, you should really keep in touch with her now.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i know what i would do if i was you    id go to her place and try and convince her to leave  and be with me    i would tell her i forgive her and that i love her   and that we are perfect for each other and i would treat you like a queen|`|OqAOCBnFaa	If I was her? I would maybe apologize. The real question should be, what should you do. That is because you may want to go visit her sometime. Just say "Hello." Ask how she has been. Also if you do, maybe you should tell her you miss her friendship.|`|mzvm80ulaa	If I were her I would be ecstatic to see you. After being through all of that I'm sure she's realized she's made a huge mistake. She was attached to him because she had sex with him, not because he was better than you. I think you should go see her. What do you have to lose? ((:    Good luck!|`|AZ1K7SHPaa	i would regret it soooooooo bad!   gl!|`|pVrKaZOmaa	Well, if i were her i would have talked to you at the very least. i would have tried to reconnect and rebuild our friendship...and wherever we went from there would have been lovely compared to anything else that i could have been going through. hope i helped!|`|l2ysEDY9aa	well, hey you ARE the better guy for her.  so if i were you i would facebook her and talk to her or go see her or someway try to talk to her!!!  she's probably thinking the same thing about you!!  maybe she needs an excuse to break up with this "bad guy".  So, my advice is to go talk to her.
3924c6cb1a9c58e6092df7c8166eddceaa	Talk to him.  Get to know him.  Ask HIM out!|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Talk to him online, too. Easy way to talk with a lot less likelihood of awkwardness.|`|MF9YknDYaa	Ask him out,one day we will all be old and close to death,what's the worst thing that could happen if you ask him out?|`|SSNcpI6qaa	well in study hall, start flirting and if ur as awkward as you say then you should goolge some flirting tips! their really helpful! lol gud luck! ;)|`|RYNbCajyaa	invite him out for coffee or lunch..it's a great way to talk and get to know eachother outside of school...and if it's during the day, it makes it seem more like just lunch instead of a real date.. it's a stepping stone that may lead to ??? who knows?|`|AoWiecjdaa	ask him out or flirt with him a little and hint that you want to go out with him.
sLEoWYr5aa	Having to get my head around this one you've confused me a bit, I presume he likes you both, there are two gorgeous girls at my school who I like both, but I don't rub up against them or eye them up though!     Try and see how he acts towards each of you if you are separate.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I don't know. You know the person better than we do and if you can't figure it out, how do you expect us to? How about you just talk to him. He isn't going to bite your head off.|`|vRImZ32Maa	Ask him straight forward, because they way he is treating you is not nice.|`|j3U6zjHzaa	You know this guy has to be disillusioned if your telling me everything. What I would do is you know maybe like just start a conversation. Don't start it with "hey whats your prob". Just be nice and then when you start talking and getting to know him then ask. Hope I helped....GOOD LUCK!!!|`|aztQDdMXaa	My boyfriend used to do the same thing, and we ended up dating, and have been together for 5 years.  =>_  but i did ask him, and thats when he told me....|`|KWxwishQaa	he just wants the bod ese|`|c8UYFBA4aa	ok. first off u need to get ur he's and she's straight like wat does this mean: (he knows that she likes her). and u guys are like 10?|`|GmPIU2MNaa	Mmm... i couldn't find a question.. oh well.. He is confused ^^, I really don't think its his purpose to confuse you to X'D    BUT... to solve the big question... You have to ask him ;D|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	If he "always looks at me and brushes up against me and sits as close to my seat as he can. I was walking with my friend in the hallway and he was staring at her (he knows that she likes her) but then he brushed up against my arm", then how can you possibly say he's not a player?
Jn4FkMRmaa	Aren't you smart....all carnation weddings are the hottest look going right now!    On prices, as previously said, it all depends on which shop you use...BUT, before you start comparing prices, make sure you're getting quotes for the same item. ie. "Brides bo-k, hand-tied nosegay style using 20 Nora pink carnations. Stems tied and wrapped with ivory satin and finished with pearl head pins".....your price range on this bouquet is probably going to be $35-$55.     When shopping for a florist look at their quality of work as well as prices. This is one place it pays you to spend a little more for higher quality work. You're paying for design ability as well as the actual flower itself. Make sure that the designs in the photos you are shown were done by florist and aren't some "canned" photos. Quality shops show brides their work first.    Your maids can use smaller bo-ks,  say 12-18  carns  while yours should have at least 20-25. Let me say this, use natural color flowers, not artificially tipped ones. you can mix several pink shades with white or cream ones to get a great look. If you have your florist add rhinestone jewels or pearls to your bo-ks you'll have a great holiday look with added "Bling".|`|RuKK1LYiaa	It all depends on who you go to to have flowers done, every florist has a price but it just happens to be different than everyone elses good luck

74gPuaXMaa	I don't care much for anything. I think all I want on Valentine's Day is to be with my girlfriend, and be appreciated for being there for her, and showing her a good time. Love is all anyone can truly want on such a day.|`|dd242da77f64ad0e25bb846806bd953caa	Depends on how much you want to spend.  But you can never go wrong with baking him something, or cooking him a special meal.|`|urfVAfHAaa	Good Question I have been with mine for over 5 years and some times i don't have a clue on what to get him, Lets see what are things he likes or needs or is in to or maybe a teddy bear with some candy, Or if he is in to sports|`|X48z0Lwwaa	something cool (of course) and if it's small enough, put it in a cool wooden cigar box.  Cigar boxes are very masculine, smell good, and great to keep small personal items like rings, cuff links, photos, etc.|`|UG2z5rGIaa	well if your at that stage in your realtionship where you guys are comfortable and  you say i love you and etc.  then its time to get him something 'big'    make it meanigful and special. something that only you two share in common. or get him a heartfelt card and his favourite candies     or just think about the gifts he's gotten you the past valentines day's   find somehting that seems eqivelent to that for you to give to him.    good luck  happy valentines day to you both :]|`|MuSYw7m3aa	i would get him sometihng kinda funny but kinda sweet still, like white boxers with red hearts on them(classic :D) he has to love them. sexy and still funny and sweet :D  good luck!|`|u6nahnuwaa	a knife and a hat.|`|MmPnh8VIaa	the best reward for your boyfriend on valentines day is just telling him simply that you love him and you wanna be with him. that makes every guy happy.|`|bWjlXxB3aa	GET HIM THIS  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEdoLKknC...|`|K3tjbHKzaa	Kisses and a gift card to his favorite restaraunt that way he'll take you. :) Hope this helps!!|`|Zx67Ipivaa	How about..... hmm.... let me think.......oh...no...... how about a box of chocolates and a card and a CD of his favorite band or a movie that you give to him and after you give the movie then ask him to come to your house to watch it or or or or or or  huh huh huh im out of breath JK!! just do one of those or just something he really wants.|`|4OxDLaJLaa	since you have been dating for awhile now,   try making him something from the heart.  if you're running low on cash try something like a scrap book  include pictures, poems, items from events you've went to together,  your favorite song lyrics.  or if your not feeling very creative get movies like "The Notebook"  for instance and have a nice dinner before, that should surely   put you in the loving mood.   =]  hope it helped.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	cookies|`|3FXJtjq6aa	try somthing sexy.|`|E2aN3ZBaaa	hmm it's really hard  but u can give him a nice t-shirt form hollister  guys love that  and of course a kiss|`|fba450c791c2e5aa34640f936bd5aad7aa	If you have to ask your to young to be asking.. maybe some chocolates|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	make his a nice home cooked dinner with candle, every guy loves food.     or get him his favorite teams jersey, hat exc.    guys can be hard to get for you you've been with him for 3 years lol you should know his likes and all.    good luck! hope everything turns out good!|`|Qc3bu3ioaa	find out wat he likes! ask him questions but dont let him know that your getting him something! til u know wat he wants, get it! you hav 14 days to get him something!|`|sz4lAIjgaa	a ******** is what my baby is getting|`|ESq2yEgCaa	Be creative look up ideas online
uRDdtM56aa	i dont think she is really suicidal. i think she is just going through a really rough time and doesnt want to have to deal with the pain of losing her father. i havent lost a parent but i have a friend and a cousin who both have. they certainly have bad days, but they have managed to keep up their heads and move on. im really sorry for everything she is going through. the only thing you can do is be there for her through everything. good luck!!|`|BZeTJHXhaa	my dad died in August of last year and i was terrified. he had lung cancer for about seven months before he passed. did i feel like crap? yes. did i want to kill myself AT TIMES? yes. But, i realized that he was in a better place and that he wasn't in pain anymore.    as far as what i wanted to hear... nothing seemed to help me at the time. i know people were just trying to help, but i was so hurt that everything seemed against me.     for your friend... i can understand why should would feel extremely upset but going to the extremes of wanting to kill herself is odd. you said that she said she didn't mean it, but she felt that way. What you need to do is just love her--- it's difficult and she needs your help right now. just make sure she knows you love her and are there for her. if her dad does end up dying, don't mention anything like "oh, at least he's in a better place now." even if that's true, it still stings to hear ppl think that they know what's for their family.    if she does that again, i would tell her "honey i know you said you didn't mean it but I'm extremely worried about you-- if you would like, we can go talk to someone about it and i will go with you because i care about you."     best hopes for your friend. =]|`|NYg0M9Ttaa	Tell your guidance office at school. They'll help her and keep it anonymous.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	cheer her up anyway you can. just stay by her side and comfort her when she needs it and watch out to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid. tell her that everything will be alright and life will get better, she is only 15.|`|pLlcEQOIaa	i never lost aa parent at age 15, im not even 15 yet.you will have to let her get through this cuz she will be sad for awile about her dad dying|`|IGz2wBj5aa	She needs some help. One of my good friends called with a gun to his head. And he suffered extreme depression. I had no choice but to calm him down and try to keep him from pulling the trigger. My other friend (who was with me) called the police and gave them his address. He saw a therapist and his life is now way better. All you need to do is keep her happy. And speak up. Tell an adult, the police, or anyone who can help.|`|KDrztUEpaa	Unlike mentioned above, DO NOT tell your guidance office. I personally CANNOT STAND when those people get involved in my personal life.     I'm sorry, that would have scared me too! Just reestablish that she has a lot of friends who love her and care about her. You could also mention how heart broken her parents would be. maybe if she seems willing to talk you  could talk to her about her mother. How she would feel if she lost both her husband and her daughter.|`|sZWxp8gLaa	Many things could be going wrong in her life right now that you need to consider, things that aren't that obvious, like physical or sexual abuse-Tons of things.  My advice is to be more observant to see if anything seems "off".  Also, try talking to her...Wait till' the two of you are alone and then talk to her personally.  Tell her she's your best friend and that she can tell you anything.  That you know somethings wrong and that if she wants it to be a secret you won't tell a soul (of course, if it's something like abuse you need to tell) so just give her that opportunity, more than once!|`|iI36w7wVaa	You are already being an incredible friend. All you can do is be there for her, and be her friend. And, if the stakes get too high, do exactly what you thought you might and call someone. Call 911.  Get her help.  If she can't handle that on her own and her friends are doing much good no matter how caring they are being, she needs outside help.  Is her mother still around? Get her mother to talk to her because she is losing a husband. She has to be going through a lot of pain as well, and she can relate to her daughter.    This isn't your battle, but you can still do a lot by being there for her.  I hope everything is alright.|`|C51fLujQaa	Your friend was obviously in a strange mood last night, and couldn't think straight. Either that, or maybe they just wanted a lot of attention from people. Sometimes only the most shocking statements catch others' eyes...|`|chx228r7aa	Okay,  I havent exactly lost my parents but i lost my grandpa.  He was very close to me.  I still think i want to be with him.  Theres not alot you can say because shes feeling vonerable.  But honestly if her dads been sick that long he's suffering.  Maybe he needs to be in a better place,  And tell her that.  She might not understand but she will in time.  Her father wouldnt want her to give up her life for him.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	I think you doing what you are doing, listening and letting her know you care, are good things.  She really should seek counseling.  I would encourage that.  She is going through a rough time but suicide is not the answer.  Even if she feels better, she should still seek counseling.  What about her mother?  Can she talk to her too?  She should write things down in a journal.      It would be good for her to volunteer somewhere.  She can help put smiles on others faces and lift her spirit.  There are soup kitchens that need help with feeding the homeless.  It is a great experience.  It might give her something else to think about.  You should go and ask her to come with you.    Get her involved with other things.  I would probably still let her mother know also what she has been saying.  Hugs to you and her and her family.  God Bless all of you.|`|ClxJQmiUaa	Just try to comfort her, she is probably very sad. Just make sure she knows that her dad loves her and he will see her in heaven. Go with her to the school counselor so all three of you can talk or you can just go and stand outside the door while her and the counselor talk and then you can try and help her too. Just make sure she knows that she is lucky and that she has friends that love her probably as much as you do. I don't know if this actually works but i've heard exercise helps relieve stress so maybe you and her can try walking around a nice place with pretty, calm scenery on a sunny day because it makes me feel good and it might help her and you too! Maybe a park or a woodsy trail around a lake! I hope I could help and I wish the best for you and your friend and that God be with you!    Jen

ksqPjgEUaa	Oh sweetie, I can't imagine anything a 12 year old could do to cause people to treat you so cruel.   You're dad has some serious issues if he's abusing you & your mother sounds like she's enabling the abusive behavior.  You have to know that you DO NOT deserve to be mistreated.   If there is a school counselor you can talk to? A teacher? Another parent?.. You are too young to have to see such a cruel world & have a whole life to experience away from this.... Talk to someone. If they don't know, they can't help you.   Please email me anytime if I can help you, I will.|`|0cmfQqMEaa	thts awful. ur a great person and u shouldnt listen to what ppl say or do to u. u need to stay strong and overcome this. maybe talk to someone about it or write ur feelings in a journal?? tht way u can look back on it and be like whoa why did i do/feel tht thn avoid the situations tht made u feel tht way. best of luck to ya =) and dont worry theres always some1 out there tht would be willing to listen and help you|`|WkdW04cNaa	You need to talk to a counselor.............is there one at school?|`|1D2UiAJeaa	get the courage to tell someone. The person sitting next to you, behind you, in front. A girl mostly, at your age guys will probably a-h*les and think it would be cool to ignore you. Speak to a high school administrator. Vice principal perhaps, they are good listeners.    EDIT: do not commit suicide man, you are not even a teen yet and you have a lot to look forward to. Join an after school activity, sports maybe. It will distract you and keep you less time with your father. You will also make great friends with teammates/coach too.|`|jY6eUN9haa	oh no  thts horrible  im so sorry you've had it pretty bad  You need to call child line if you feel its tht bad and if your mum is saying tht to you...  dont cut yourself or attempt suicide  dont worry something good will come  .....i really dont know how to help tht much  and non of it is your fault|`|AA11612196	talk to the school conselor|`|W3nCHPUtaa	You need to tell find the courage.

[Chorus:]  But I miss screamin and fightin and kissin in the rain  and its 2am and Im cursin your name.  Youre so in love that you act insane  and thats the way I loved you.  Breakin down and comin undone  its a roller coaster kinda rush.  And I never knew I could feel that much.  And thats the way I loved you.    He respects my space  And never makes me wait  And he calls exactly when he says he will.  Hes close to my mother  Talks business with my father.  Hes charming and endearing  And Im comfortable.    But I miss screamin and fightin and kissin in the rain  And its 2am and Im cursin your name.  Youre so in love that you act insane  And thats the way I loved you.

I'm sorry, that's rough, but you love your boyfriend, and you know that he loves you. Stick with him, at least for now. If you lose feelings for him, be gentle breaking up with him. Then you can try to "get with" your best friend. I have only been in one serious relationship, and I am still with this guy, and I'm 4 years younger than you so I have little experience, ,but trust me, crushes while you are already with someone else is common. It'll probably pass.|`|NHecGoGaaa	you have 3 choices...     one..    either you stay with your current Boyfriend and be happy but stay wonderingif the one that got away was a better choice...    or    Dump your current boyfriend and go with your best friend.. But remember, if it doesn't work out with your bff, not only will you lose your a boyfriend, but the friendship you guys once had will be ruined. No matter what people say or agree on, after they've broken up, things are NEVER the same... not only that, but your old boyfriend (the one you dumped for your Bff) most likely wont come back with you..  so you are juggling with both happiness, and loneliness..     last choice...    If you cant beat 'em, join em!..  Go lesbian!.. in my personal experience, i love women!.. but thats because im a guy..     lol..     Good Luck!!!!..|`|FYsEtTRbaa	I'm in a slightly similar situation. I'm so sorry. This sort of thing really sucks. I just avoided the guy I was developing feelings for, but I don't recommend this when its your best friend.   I recommend you ask yourself if you subconciously want drama (seriously, I do at times) and pretend you don't feel that way about him.    (Fake it til you make it) But don't try to find him a girlfriend to "get over" him. It will, WILL make it worse, because you will want him more.|`|qewAfUgJaa	Imagine your life in 20-30 years. Do you see yourself thinking about memories of him, or him?|`|elVDYy7eaa	Well, this is a dilemma! But, to me, your choice is easy. You can leave your "most amazing" boyfriend for the other guy, and take the risk of being labelled a "cheat", or worse, (you'd know better than me the hurtful and spiteful terms used by teenagers). Or, you can take the morally correct course, and stay with your boyfriend, and know that your relationship will last the distance because it's based on trust, not lies.  If your boyfriend is treating you well, and is faithful, then there is no reason to leave him. The choice of what to do here is yours, but consider wisely, and take what your heart tells you is the right course. I am hoping that it will be to stay. God bless!|`|fzIeGPZYaa	seriously get away from your friend and get closer to your bf, my bf and i were together for 2 yrs and he started liking an ex of his who was still his friend. it wasnt the entire reason why we broke up but it was the final straw for me, and we have never gotten back together and things have just gotten worse between us.|`|ec35c45458d391650124caccb1cab120aa	stay single. and change your name.|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	follow your heart|`|xbMLtXOuaa	you said it yourself, youre sixteen, dont worry about so much, you got lots of time|`|47R03TbFaa	DEAR remember this little saying     SOME FRIENDS ARE FOR DATING   SOME FRIENDS ARE FOR KEEPING     AND IF YOU CHERISH YOUR BEST FRIEND THEN DON'T DATE HIM/HER BECAUSE ONCE YOU DATE YOUR BEST FRIEND AND IF DON'T WORK OUT THEN YOUR CLOSE FRIENDSHIP IS GONE FOREVER AND THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING IT BACK  TO THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE YOU STARTED DATING|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	go with your heart, but before you leap make sure its the right one you want and will be there for you no matter what.  good luck!|`|2s4jLzLaaa	slow  down  your moving to fast|`|pwY5jwOIaa	Yeah thats a problem, but if you ask me then i would say that you should find out about this guy your falling for, because if you break it off with your bf now fr him and he doesnt like you back thne your screwed =/ so find out about him,. And then consider theyre differences and choose the one that treats you right. I honestly think that this is going to take a little while, but give it time and it will all fall into play for the best. Just dont push anything to fast, take it slow and you will be fine! :)|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, if you are confused, maybe you are not one hundred percent in love with this amazing boyfriend.|`|xmWxafHSaa	That is a tough one but you need to follow your heart.  Some of the best relationships start out as friends.  So there could be something there with your best friend that could be great.    Don't rush into anything, just take your time and try to figure it out.      Your boyfriend could be an amazing person but if you don't have the feelings for him that you should have for a boyfriend then you owe it to him to be honest with him.|`|sCyYKFNiaa	THREESOME!!!!    ..Nah I'm kidding, pathetic attempt to lighten to mood :p    Hmm well.. I've been in your shoes before! I think it's probably common for people in long term relationships to get a little bored and restless after a while, but that doesn't say anything bad about you or your guy.     You have two options. You could wait it out with your boyfriend, who is obviously an awesome guy by the way you describe him. Try to spice up your relationship and find out new things about each other: Try the book "Do you know your boyfriend?" which has quirky questions to ask each other. Spend time together doing things you don't normally do (skip movie night and go for a nature hike). Try to really focus on what makes your boyfriend so special, and just remember that there is no such thing as the perfect boy. If your boyfriend lacks a couple of personality flaws that you find match in this other guy, then focus on the outstanding qualities about him that the other guy doesn't have and weigh which ones are more important to you.     Your other options is to take a break from your boyfriend and spend time with this other guy. You might actually notice that he isn't as great of a fantasy that you thought he was. If he happens to be your true prince charming, then you know you made a good choice. If not, talk it out with your boyfriend. You'll probably bring yourself closer to him now that you see what you were missing!  Remember that even though this other guy is your best friend, it doesn't mean he will be a good boyfriend. I think the temptation may be part of your attraction to him. You know it's wrong which kind of makes it more exciting. From what you've said, it sounds like you don't know if this other guy is into you in that way. Please don't throw everything you have with your boyfriend away because there MIGHT be a CHANCE with some other guy.    But remember, do no stay with your boyfriend out of pity or because you can't find it within yourself to finish it. You cannot stay with someone because you feel sorry for , you'll only end up regretting and feeling like you lost out and you want more all thet time and in the end it hurts more.    You also don't want to ruin the friendship you have with this other guy. If you finish your boyfriend for him and realise you made a mistake, you may end up resenting him. Similarly, if you start going out and then split up, it's unlikely you will ever be able to resume your friendship as it was. You like this guy because he must be a great person.. that is why he's your best friend.  & Thinking to much can drive you mad, you are young with a whole life ahead of you, you need to take your time and think things through you know the answer yourself deep down, we all have the inner voices and we seldom listen to what they tell us, what ever you decide to do i wish you well. Be honest with yourself and your boyfriend that your with.    If you continue to talk to the other boy, your feelings will only grow more for him because you will begin looking at what he offers that your current boyfriend doesn't. Any chance you may get, you will probably pick at your boyfriends flaws or start a pointless argument. If you think your best interest is to be with your boyfriend, try your best to stop talking to the other guy for a while, if you want to be with the other boy than your current boyfriend, make sure you know exactly what you are doing.      I think before you make any decisions about the other guy, you need to seriously think about your relatonship with your boyfriend. Do you really want to be with him? Because if you're falling for someone else there must be something wrong with your relationshop with your boyfriend. An underlying issue? You need to identigy it and sort it out.  FORGET about the other guy for the moment.. with him out of the way, is your relationship with your boyfriend good? Are you happy with it? If they answer is yes then there's no problem. If the answer is no then you need to ask yourself if there's a way to fix this problem. Communication and compromise is the key. If the problem is beyond fixing then it's for the best to end your relationship with your boyfriend. You say he's 'amazing' but that doesn't necessarily mean he is right for you.    Some people might suggest making a pros and cons list but at the end of the day, these lists or whatever are just stuff written down, it's not real and it's not helpful because it won't tell you anything about the way you FEEL. and that is what's important. It's a cliche but follow your heart.|`|auJbcgX1aa	This right here shows how hard it is to please a girl - If she has an asshole bf, then she wants a nice guy and vice versa. Do whatever you want, it's your choice but you will end up regretting it later, thats how it always goes. Me telling you that right now doesn't help change how you feel and your going to do what you want regardless but I wanted to atleast give you a headsup.     Later.|`|HDaiuhvuaa	that is the same thing happening to me but reversed. my boyfriend has a best female friend that i think he is love with. My advice from the bottom of my heart is to leave your current boyfriend. Save him the heart ache of loving someone who loves another. Nothing beats a best friend that is also a lover. But i feel very sorry for your current boyfriend. He has already lost.|`|TMhVClBgaa	this answer is a little obvious but you HAVE TO CHOOSE!|`|AoWiecjdaa	see if you best friend likes anyone and if he doesn't break up with your bf|`|GFHRpDE4aa	Follow your heart girl, if you don't like the man your with you can't change it and you need to get rid of him, and if your best friend likes you then your in luck.|`|SSNcpI6qaa	i no this might sound corney but follow ur heart and whoever you like more and that u think will treat you better go for him!|`|ESq2yEgCaa	This happens to AL-OT of people so your not alone stay with your awesome bf because you don't want to jeopardize a friendship|`|JHWQDWfQaa	um. . . i no 4 a fact that u will fall in love with ur best friend..  and then ull have to choose.  then someones heart will get broken..|`|HGeN6LqDaa	I don't know what you should do, but just remember whatever you decide won't be the end of the world. You're young so you're probably going to date a lot of guys once you graduate and go to college or whateer it is you decide to do with life.|`|aa489aa0a7c4628062eeb385b97bd1c4aa	do like t.i. said and live your life.    i went through the same thing and no matter how hard i fought it  i ended up falling for the new guy and i kno it wasn't the best but the heart wants what the heart wants
vJwl2uoBaa	You are not overreacting at all.  Verbal abuse is just as bad as physical abuse.  The others are right about you being able to choose who you want to live with as long as your mom is not a a drug addict, alcoholic, etc..  I would try to avoid him as much as possible, but you should talk to your mom and tell her how uncomfortable you are being there with him.  She should be putting her feelings aside right now and doing what is best for you and your sisters.  If that means not spending the night with her bf, so be it.  Your dad is probably taking out his aggression for your mother on you, since she is not there.   Sorry you are going through this.|`|jChr0udLaa	You are old enough that a judge will let you decide who you want to live with. In the mean time is there some one you can talk to? A friends parents or your school counselor? What about your grandma?|`|yTTXjQSmaa	First of all my dad is the biggest dick on the face of the planet and i have to deal with his crap everyday. I can relate to you but first you have to stand up for yourself. Its possible that they'll ask you who you want to live with your mom or you dad. Based on that they'll also take into consideration which parent is best suited to take care of their children. I hope everything works out for you.

0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	I'm not surprised, I'm appalled. This SINGLE woman (who lives with her mother in a 2 or 3 bedroom house) is a "stay at home" mom who doesn't work and she now has 14 CHILDREN!!! The only reason to do this is to jack free stuff off of people who will feel sorry for these kids. Someone is going to give her a house, a van, clothes, food, diapers, toys, college funds, etc. Welfare is going to pick up a tab, too.     I am shocked that a doctor in his right mind would give this woman fertility drugs when she already has six kids. At some point, I would have to draw the line, no matter if it is her body or not. And who is going to pick up that hospital tab? Can you imagine the team they had to put together to deliver all those kids?     In California, they put a limit on the number of CATS and DOGS you can have in one house because the animals won't get proper care. And now this nutcase has 14 KIDS in a tiny house? With no husband? God help these poor kids. I hope social services starts making visits NOW.    FOLLOW UP: I checked on this story and the mother of this woman said she has been obsessed with having children since she was a teenager. Doctors also said that she most likely got illegal fertility drugs and then was artificially inseminated b/c no fertility doctor w/ any ethics would give someone that many fertility drugs and do in-vitro purposefully. It's way too dangerous to both the mother and the fetus(es). He said when you do in-vitro, the best outcome is one viable embyro; that even twins is dangerous and no self-respecting doctor would put their patient or their baby(ies) in such a precarious position. But it's unsure how it happenend; the mother said her daughter had fertilized embryos left over from a previous treatment and decided to implant them all. Who knows? Sounds like a bunch of nuts. Again, God help those poor kids.|`|urxXvW0Vaa	Nice to see other people see the madness in this.  Wow when I WANTED my tubes tied years ago, my doctor wouldn't do it.  Go figure.  Well I have two kids, three jobs, and a husband and I can't make ends meet or afford college for my older one.  No one is out there handing me anything.  I have a friend who is unemployed because their company went out of business, and he is getting no help.  I don't understand the madness in this country.  I feel somewhat sorry for the kids, but the worst part is they will probably grow up and do the exact same thing.  Lets just keep draining the system.|`|aa489aa0a7c4628062eeb385b97bd1c4aa	it's her body and she can do wat she wants    u can't stop her|`|pgF6i0L4aa	haha thats crazy who would want to have that many kids. and no we prob cant stop his madness.|`|ctjz1Btiaa	It's up to her as long as she can pay the bills. I don't like tax money going to idiots.|`|29360f739fd46229348227a5ac6fbedfaa	Your right it is madness & crazy. On the news,it said that her mom said that she is obsessed with having lots of kids. She needs to see a psychiatrist! She certainly would do a lot more good to people if she were a school teacher.     I think that they only pay up to a certain amount of kids for welfare. She certainly didn't need to be taking any fertility drugs to have any more kids,since she already has 6 at home. What she should of been getting is her tubes tied!. 6 is plenty enough already!|`|WNIL4sLiaa	It's called 'social blight'.

That is terrifying in itself.  She clearly doesnt learn anything in school kids cant develop when they are thrown into this situation and she certainly needs counseling 9 months too late.  I really hope the children will be ok but I'm skeptical.  Sad that the doctors that approved this treatment and her child addicted mind was the right storm for such a selfish act.

biF7sad1aa	He probably beats you up because he doesn't like you.  Have you thought of being a more likable person?
53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.|`|ZhvyzU6saa	just flirt wit him talk to him a lot hang out with him and stuff or hang out wit other guys to make him jealous|`|cJPzdk1Taa	Get close to him. I'm a sucker for that. Just lean on him or something. :)|`|kt9iXMWUaa	Just be yourself!  Actions speak louder than words, so smile at him a lot.  However, you may just have to come right out and tell him how you feel.  Good Luck!|`|8s9q4V03aa	tell him|`|nkCbSk6Xaa	when i like a boy i try and find out what he likes and get in to it so we have more things in common. hope this helps|`|f2R0QzUyaa	Try to hang out with him as much as you can. But not too much of course, just dangle ur companionship with him and then if he ask for it, give it. Don't be a boring person to be with, ask anything don't hesitate. JUST ASK AND ASK! Don't be ******* shy, stop worrying coz worrying never helped anyone. If your feeling shy, just tell yourself JUST DO IT!|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	A fast way to get "close" is find out what he is interested in and ask him questions about it. This simple act tells him you share an interest and you trust him enough to ask his advice. Talk to him whenever you get the opportunity, this puts him at ease, and will also help you overcome your shyness. Saying hello and using his name is another way. Trust me, as a guy, I really appreciate when a girl takes the time to use my name, say hello and ask me questions, it breaks the ice and you will both know if there is a possible relationship.
xc2smUoqaa	I agree, don't really care for the games.  What do you think of this.. appears to be a good fit with your wine & cheese concept.    PAPER FLOWER BOUQUET: (for use at rehersal, later)    An idea that I had created: Go to WalMart, party section where they have the Martha Stewart stuff. Find the paper bouquet holder. Attach a dowel to the paper bouquet holder.    Premake paper flowers (zig zag assorted color tissue paper with a pipe cleaners (one per guest) Add a paper tag* to each flower. Each guest receives a pre-made/folded paper flower. They get to fluff up their paper flower, write their message or wish on their tag, for the bride. Pass the paper bouquet around and each guest attaches their flower to the bouquet holder. The assembled paper bouquet is to be used on the day of their wedding rehearsal and the bride gets to read each of the guests message/wedding wishes (Always a hit at showers), and it's a nice little keepsake.    Here's a web site for simple instructions re: paper flowers (it's not the best, however it gives you a general idea of what I'm trying to describe with the tissue paper folding):    http://www.do-it-yourself-weddings.com    *Paper tags are imprinted with nice designs and can be found at the scrapbook section of Michaels or any craft stores (i.e.: K & Co. Products)    Best wishes. Hope this helps.|`|HMvXkR6Faa	My mom threw my sister's shower last summer.  She didn't want games either.  The one thing she did do was she made this giant board (foam core board) with their picture on it and had felt tip pens available and everyone wrote marriage advice on it for the couple as a keep sake.    It was hanging on the wall near the front door for people to do as they came in or as they mingled.  Some advice was funny, some was serious, but it was a fun "activity" that wasn't too intrusive to the get-together atmosphere of the shower.  (It was a female only shower).|`|FXCoGD44aa	I'm going to assume that you are going to have plenty of wine and cheese at this shower...     I know you said no games, but perhaps you might want to consider a trivia activity about the history of wine? It's not cheesy - quite the opposite, I think it's sophisticated and educational.    Don't feel too much pressure to have many activities planned for the shower. With wine, plenty of presents and the exciting event to come, I bet you girls will have no problem maintaining stimulating chit chat for hours.|`|Su0LaNhoaa	Wanta good idea??  DONT HAVE ONE!!!   they are soooooo boring  no one enjoys going to them...My suggestion would be to just have a party with men and women where they dont have to open gifts in front of everyone...have some music and driinks...Bridal showers are boring as ****...everyone knows it|`|tvUAO4ioaa	My girls cut out hearts from scrapbook paper (pretty on one side, white on the other) and asked my guests to write a special note to me on them.

cfaEVLwvaa	it hasnt happened 2 me personally, but it happened 2 my aunty n her 4 kids. you will just have to wait n stick up 4yourself. dont let people judge you. and don't worry about the clothes. its true they seem important but its wats inside that counts. show people you don't care about wat they think of you. soon enough you will find friends that love you for who you are.  i know it doesn't seem like it but things are gonna brighten up soon, just keep your faith n stick by your family as none of this is their fault, they are trying to do whats best 4 u long term wise. and remember just because they dont show it doesn't mean they are not suffering as much as you are. you said you can't do nothing but wait, bt thats not true you can also stay strong and keep your faith, in fact you have to stay strong, keep your faith and wait. dont let things get to you.    you should try going to the advice borough and look for the community centre for people from your country. they are the people that can help you.  Good luck sweety.  xoxo.|`|WkdW04cNaa	I think this is harder in younger years of life where people aren't aware of what is really important.  One day we all find out that those things do not make the person and they don't matter as much as anyone thinks they do.  I would suggest that you tend to your person and be the best one that you know how and one day you will be surprised at what happens in your life :)

5AdVt7dEaa	I'm afraid that you don't understand how us guys think during the Super-bowl.  This is totally a guy thing and we really don't even want our ladies help.  It has nothing to do with you personally like he said "he wants to have some fun before the baby is born".  It's one of the few times of the year that the guys 'pack together' at the house.  Let him have his fun.  At least he's not going to a bar or something.   Now it is a problem when the lady also likes football.  but I don't know.  The only thing I can compare it to is, suppose all the ladies had a Tupperware party or some get together and one of the guys said he wants to be there.  Wouldn't it be a little awkward?   Although he probably was wrong making plans for you.    It does remind me of an episode of 'Everyone loves Raymond' where Raymond gets tickets to the superbowl and doesn't even think to ask Debra to go with him.   When she finally puts her foot down and make him take her, he still tries to arrange an itirenary for her, during the days there that doesn't involve football.|`|Swxir2ieaa	Id be upset it my boyfriend made plans FOR me, without consulting me first. You have the right to decide what you want to do, because you're not his property.|`|P1oLYKzGaa	If it is your house, then there is no reason for you to leave.  If he doesn't want you there, then tell him "tough".  Tell him, he and his friends can go somewhere else and watch the game!!  Stand your ground!!  Besides you are pregnant, surely he won't do anything to hurt you or the baby.  If not you could come watch the game with me!!    Good Luck!!  I hope it works out for you!
UE27Od7caa	well sounds like he got wat he wanted|`|KJAKihaCaa	I'm not proud of it but this guy sounds like me    I was seeing this guy for about a month. He asked  if to be his girlfriend and I said I wasn't ready. I really didn't like him, I just liked having the feeling of being liked and having a guy around to do stuff with if I got bored. (He was a rebound)  Eventually I found a guy I did like and stopped talking to the kid i was messing around with.    Make sure this doesn't happen to you|`|dKq0Ak4taa	two  months is long enough he should no how he feels  your good enough to sleep with so you should b good enough to no his feelings|`|wB6KFpVeaa	Honestly, he is saying he likes how things are, bc you guys slept together, adn he knows he can get that from you, with no strings attached.|`|LXWha3Rfaa	women fall for men before they fall for women because women is the loving,nurturing species cant help it is in are blood,don't push him that will make him run.|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	He's keeping you on a back burner while he scopes out someone else.

If it was meant to be, it will be, if not, they can be good friends    No guy or girl likes to be rushed into things and if doesn't work out, it just wasn't meant to be. But talking to him about other things is a good way to get to know someone and if they are not meant to be, it would just end up bad anyhow.

ohi0kM6Raa	you're just nervous.  whenever you talk to him, think about being yourself and see how he reacts.  it would be wise to start practicing overcoming nervousness because there are many moments in life that need confidence and these are the types of situations to practice on.    if you like him, don't totally hide your feelings but send out the vibe with attention or jokes.  no matter what happens you'll learn from it|`|jh9YA4gNaa	k i think that you should like him even if your nervous its only the first couple times your nervous , you will do great after a few :D  that story is like from a movie   :)  that must have been great !  vote me for best answer

And do you have any brothers or sisters that could help you clean the basement? And then they would also have your back with you when you get into trouble in the end for cleaning all of that up?

4kmUX5pHaa	You have just come out of a bad experience and are ready to experience another due to your own weakness. Be strong and never be in so hurry to get so intimate in a couple of meetings.  I do not thing this guy is either a serious one or shall give you a long company as per your description.   Be cautious, there are so many people wandering here and there to misuse the girls like you and have fun.|`|NOzMOJseaa	if he seems like a party boy he probably is, and if you dont want more then kissing, he's probably gonna get tired of just kissing...
W2GcDwyOaa	It doesn't matter if the girl is gorgeous or anything, what really matters is what you have in your heart for her. That's what a majority of girls look for|`|OsHjXzxUaa	thats just ur dads insecurities comming out... dont listen to his advise at allllllllllllllllllll... u deserve a pretty girl!|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	Silly question all-together.. don't specifically look or feel that you do or don't deserve either.. Look at women as (individual) people that you would like to get to know and fall in love with for who they are and fate will lead you.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Your Dad is an idiot. Either way you really should try and see past the looks and focus on personality. You'l find that women appear more beautiful if they are beautiful inside.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	Wow, i won't say anything to disrespect Your dad but he is WAY off base here, he seems to have a problem within himself, you marry the person you love and if she happens to be beautiful then great|`|lq2Ewg5Zaa	so according to that good looking girls will never get a boyfriend/husband.    that is just stupid...some men cant handle good looking girls but thats their problem they are just insecure|`|H7cNZYIYaa	I have that same little block.  It's led me to seek personal perfection, so that I can deserve to be with a girl I really like...sorry I can't help|`|XtLZXIEyaa	I would date/marry anyone you are attracted to.  (She does not have to be model looking only good looking to you inside and out.)|`|TTv1oEtaaa	Look, if you like hot girls, then you should find a hot girl that loves you.  If you want to marry...find a good looking girl that is nice and good.|`|4RfQbUypaa	I don't see the sense in that at all.  Well, what you typed out doesn't seem to make sense.  Maybe your dad meant that the good looking ones tended to be the players, which is pretty stereotypical but generally true.    Don't listen to him; find someone you love, regardless of what they look like and if they're good looking, that's a bonus.    ps - when you like someone, you also tend to find them getting more attractive as your love for them grows    butyeah.    that's just me
irS70aE7aa	That mean he is in love with your kissed and cant get enough of them and it mean your a good kisser|`|3924c6cb1a9c58e6092df7c8166eddceaa	Well, he definitely liked your kisses!!!|`|yezzZaPKaa	it means you are good kisser.!|`|rtucR0Vhaa	Yes.|`|TNNSHdypaa	No it means he wants to have sex with you.|`|HOedKyX2aa	Seems so lol|`|5rxammWbaa	oh yeah girl! :)|`|kt9iXMWUaa	According to him, you are a good kisser.

KJAKihaCaa	no it's normal to like it. It's like he's protecting you and having his warmth all around makes you sleepy.   Plus it's nice cause it's like you're his teddy bear or something and he needs to to sleep too|`|NQQaoG8Oaa	i prefer this position as well|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	no, you're just comfortable that way.|`|iGoMiU3Haa	sleeping together facing i find from a male perspective hard and close to impossible because of colliding breath. cant handle it haa :).    this way of sleep feels so much better u feel so close and its just like lock and key all over again. be happy you like this its brilliant for both partners :)|`|yiidhHOXaa	its a very cosy way of sleeping, not weird at all|`|f0623a9c89c5a91152e260fcedca706eaa	I like it too, the only prob is I have to turn a few times before I can get to sleep!|`|443CX3Bbaa	lol no i dont think so....  mayb coz im the same :p
IF9OYLx7aa	Hey girl :) I can relate to this, my mum was a lot like this when I was your age and as a matter of fact she is STILL like this, I don't live my life the way she wants and so she doesn't talk to me.  It used to bother me but know it doesn't...and here's how I handled it.    It isn't really about the piercing is it?  What I think I'm hearing is that its about the principal of the thing, that if you give in over this then your mother will expect you to just jump every time she doesn't like something?  And you're married now so you have your own life and you and your husband are your own family.    Here's some things to consider:     How much will it upset you if your Mum won't allow you in the house?  Can you 'stick this out' if your Mum digs in her heels and refuses to cave?  Because you know if you give in that will kind of destroy the whole point of your stand.    Can you arrange to see your sisters outside of your mother's home so that you still have a relationship with them?    I have a theory that people will only treat you a certain way for as long as you allow them.  Ending your Mum's reign of terror will come down to you and your ability to put an end to her demands and what you see as undue influence.  If may mean you see very little of her.     Because I refuse to belong to my families religion they don't speak to me or see me and that has been going on for 14 years.  And I'm ok with it.  Because its more important to me that I be true to myself and what I know to be right for me then to their demands.  And I'm ok with them not talking to me or seeing me,  I'm not angry or bitter.  They have a right to their choices as much as I have a right to mine.    I'm not saying your mum will be as staunch as mine.  If you decide having a relationship with your mum and being allowed in her home is more important than your piercing and you take it out then you and your husband should sit down and have a long talk about what kinds of strategies you are going to use when she begins to make further demands on you when you do something she disagrees with.  Neither way is easy.    I think your husband's point is a good one...he sounds sensible...talk it over with him some more and whatever way you handle it be calm with your Mum. You can just state your piece, whatever that is, and then walk away from it. I wouldn't argue about it.  I have piercings and tatts and when people make comments I just say that I its my choice just as its their choice not to have any.  There is always going to be someone who disagrees with the life choices that we make but they ARE ours to make no one elses.     I wish you luck girl...:)|`|Wf1mVDbYaa	I believe your mother has your best interests at heart. She still sees you as her little girl... as every decent loving parent has done and will do ..and as you will with your daughter in 18 or20 years time.....I speak from a position of experience, my daughter is 34 years old ,but she is still my little girl.,,,,,I have read your question carefully, and I think Chris is right,... you are an adult as you say so treat this hickup in a adult way.   Cant you contact your sisters on the mobile phone? ,meet them from school or work? I hope my ramblings have been of some help to you..... and contact me anytime if you feel I have been of some help....all the best to you   Nemisis.|`|lwFo3IWtaa	I think you are right, if you give in on this she will continue doing these things to you. So my advice is dont take the piercing out, leave it in and let her see she cant bully you, because that is what she is doing whether she sees it that way or not.|`|lf4Qj1T8aa	It sounds silly, but this sort of control can be considered a type of emotional abuse. You don't live with your mother, you don't rely on her, and she shouldn't be bargaining your visiting time with your family members because of a rule that no longer applies to you.    You need to talk to her -- probably via the phone or if all else fails, email -- and tell her this. Tell her it's not only unfair but cruel to keep you from seeing your family just because of a piece of jewelry. Tell her you're not backing down from this, and that it's irresponsible of her to assume you will.|`|DqmMW2tcaa	I agree with the other posters. I woudn't give in to her blackmail. Can you perhaps arrange to meet your sisters somewhere other than your mothers house?|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Personally I would not give in to her blackmail. It will be neverending. However she may also never change and hold out forever. You have to decide for yourself if you want to be controlled or independent. How sad that her love is so conditional. I feel sorry for her because her intense selfishness will eventually cost her losing her family.|`|t2SGVG1Vaa	Yeah, it would be different if you were 16, but you are an adult and she can't be the one to make decisions about things as small as lip piercings. If I were you, I wouldn't take it out either, she is just trying to control you.    She might continue, but maybe you could try to talk with her and let her know what's going on and that she's being a control freak [but maybe find a nice way to say it...haha], because it isn't right for her to disallow you to see your sister JUST because there is a tiny hole and a piece of metal in your lip.    So basically my advice is just to stand your ground but try to talk to her about it. Even if she doesn't seem like she's listening, she will probably at least think about what you say.    You probably already realized this/whatever, but I hope it helps anyway :\
wGWYRD3Baa	That's actually pretty good.    Be prepared for three other possibilities:  - He doesn't want to go  - He already has a date  - He doesn't want to ask you.    Not discouraging you whatsoever, just don't get your hopes so high that you get crushed if they don't happen.    Go for it :)|`|kNeKaZw2aa	Or...you could ask him.|`|peFFvr9faa	well kinda? if you like him and your sure he likes you then go ahead! just maybe dont say i dont want to go alone or only if someone asks|`|lq2Ewg5Zaa	too much bla bla bla|`|JW2gxnNQaa	yeah sounds good ask him why he doesnt want to go.|`|ZPqDhHpyaa	If you are pretty sure you should just go for the kill and ask him! The confidence and assertiveness could definitely be a surprise and a good one! What do you have to lose?|`|81MgVTicaa	ya. that way u dont sound too eager but you dont sound like ur not interested. try that or if hes not going say hey we could go together since were both not going. that way we get 'involved' in school activities/ that worked for me =]
AA11618874	It could be the thing that breaks up their friendship. We boys are dumb like that.  Go out with the one that you like the most and the one you believe will treat you the best. Don't worry about the other 2. If you go out with a guy only because you didn't want to cause trouble while you secretly liked his friend more, you will resent him and there can be no love in it from your side of it. so go for the one you wish and let the others cry on each-other's shoulders.
P1oLYKzGaa	sounds like he is just testing you.  If your friendship is as strong as you say it is, then nothing should happen.  But maybe you should try ignoring HIM for a couple of weeks or so and see what happens.  Or be the first to make the move.  Sounds like he just wants to be friends anyway.  So if you have another fella that you are serious about, maybe you should pay more attention to him, instead.    Good Luck!!|`|UCd6blZgaa	he's trying to make you crazy.   he likes you.  he SO likes you,|`|nvsVXlBlaa	It sounds like he likes you but is scared or something. ask him flat out and see what he says.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	ask him why he doesnt answer or call|`|SgGvWzJeaa	This guy sounds like he's playing games. He has a gf but I think he wants a backup... just in case.|`|shDLRyDnaa	he likes u a whole he's scared probably scared u guys wont wrok n then your friendship will be awkward afterwrds. he doesnt call or txt because he;s trying to read how u feel n kno if u really like him
AA11099449	Sounds like the guy is trying to be cheap on you. Usually early in a relationship a guy will go all out to impress not this one lol well if thats his best foot forward look elsewhere because he's only going to get cheaper. what you should tell him is to enjoy himself and you have another date.|`|XtLZXIEyaa	He sounds like a Jackass to me.|`|T87pwfi4aa	Maybe he doesnt think it'll work out and wants to save his money?|`|tWzdvnlwaa	Sounds like a real cheapskate! Can you imagine a future with someone that tight with money?|`|rC0lhevEaa	Maybe you should tell him that you would like it he came over and cooked for you.|`|AA10960571	You should be careful sounds like this guy is only interested in getting you drunk and having sex.  Follow your instincts|`|0NjU7Ps0aa	i dont think you should do that because he's just trying to get you drunk so you can sleep with him...i dont know, thats my view on things lol  but suggest to have you guys cook dinner together since the economy does suck right now and not everyone can afford a dinner out you know? lol
rh3RNM5faa	-The fire won't vanish  -The flowers won't wither  -The glass cannot break  -Our friendship can't disconnect  -The moonlight will never stop shining
hsvgllTwaa	i personally think that it is best to wait for someone who feel comfortable with and trust. i wouldn't have sex for the first time with any person! it would have to be with someone who i consider the "right" person, because i will trust them enough and feel ok with them seeing me naked.....    it depends on you as a person..whether you feel ready. My friend (boy) was always dead set on waiting for the perfect girl to lose his virginity, whereas his best mate had sex as soon as he could!    erm the time varies..i mean my friend was a virgin..and hadn't kissed a boy or anything...and went all the way within 3 months. whereas my other friend waited 6 months...it depends on the person..    hope this helped ya  x|`|6zfpexuIaa	they all say THE RIGHT PERSON but who cares if u want it at that time?|`|QAGaQUDRaa	The "right" person today might be completely different from your "right" person down the line, but if you care about each other, do whatever feels right at the time.
iGoMiU3Haa	im my personal opinion this is a sign of obvious immaturity to relationships and just plain attention wants from ur gf. ive been in these situations before in relationships and it wasnt even this serious just like texting and it boiled me down.    the whole question of trust comes down here and oh dont they love to use it against you in these situations the whole 'you dont trust me' thing.     personal opinions are ultimatem. its only gunna drive you down from jealously and anger. its gotta stop else the relationship should stop because only you will be effected.    plus if you give this ultimatem and follow it through its possible you will reveal her true feelings if she really wants to be with you she will change the problems. if not and she dosent care was she worth it anyway?    overall though yes there is a balance in trust you do have to let her have some space with other people to socialise however girls dont understand this line sometimes and abuse it then cant see why you are upset by it. perhaps for one obvious reason she maybe likes this guy? its a possibility. if shes letting it happen shes crossing this boundary line alot mate. if u want to ask more since ive been in similar situations then just private message me.    bestof luck|`|AZYvuU6Uaa	Speaking as a woman, she knows fine well. And she's loving it!    See how she likes it - you must have girls in your class too, right?    I think to be honest you know exactly whats going on here dont you?    Now, speaking as a girlfriend, i would find it completely inappropriate to have another man tickle, hug, play fight, be suggestive, buy me presents, touching me, poking me or asking me to sit on his lap. I have respect for myself and my boyfriend, something that your little angel seems to be greatly lacking in.    Your getting played :(|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	SHE KNOWS......DUMP HER.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	it might seem innocent to her|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	she KNOWS she just likes the attention, and maybe she is playing you|`|AA11011446	She should be telling this guy to stop.  Alarm bells would be ringing in my head if i were you as to the reason why she hasn't made it clear to this silly guy that she's not interested.    Sit her down and talk to her, telling her seriously that you can no longer put up with this.  It's her decision then as to what she wants to do.  Best of luck.|`|AA11535009	She's the naive one? I think you should really be spending a lot more time with her. Something doesn't sound right in this situation and the only way, short of hiring a detective, is to spend time with her and see if this "screws up" their schedule. Good Luck Dval|`|hSOfnvuaaa	Sorry 2 say this...She Knows Mate unless she is just really stupid?|`|kNeKaZw2aa	She knows perfectly well what's going on, and you need to put the b*tch in her place or leave her. I'm serious, too.|`|P9avMTBqaa	im really sry to break this to you, but im pretty sure she knows wats going on and making it look like she is naive but really isnt. You should ask some friends to watch wat they do so you dont get played
27eb1d482ab9a7d18f38ee9e8c1837a0aa	i always felt like running away so know exactly how you feel.  try getting a job abroad like france, spain, ireland, the US etc.   there is so much work available over-seas and if you do hotel work you can get accommodation there, also other jobs may offer accommodation.  once you get yourself sorted you could find other work or accommodation if you wanted, or return home if you felt things were solved back home with your parents.  you should think about reporting the offences your boyfriends committed to the police, they don't have to prosecute, and he doesnt have to know you have reported him (but check with them first to make sure.) they should have this recorded for many reasons, such as your future safety, and other future offences on other women etc.  2 women a week in england and wales are killed by a violent partner or ex partner, so you need to get rid, and break all contact, if this can only be done by leaving the country then so be it, your safety and happiness is far more important then traditional religious beliefs.  try not to look upon it as "running away" though, you can never run from your problems, but you can deal with them and move on.  there are organisations that help with domestic violence, and forced marriage (if that bit applies to you). there are also safe houses all around the UK, and you can be placed in one if you feel you may be in any immediate danger.  i hope if you leave you are able to explain everything to your parents, even if its in a letter.  i feel very bad for you being in such a dilema.    good luck with everything, hope you find happiness soon x|`|FavaF3ioaa	I would love to run away, but I doubt it will happen.    I have been wed off in an arranged marriage to a guy 20+ on me, but I'm in love with another guy, but he lives on the other side of the World, and I've loved him for 8 years and doubt I will ever be with him :(    You could run away to anywhere in the EU, without needing a Visa =]     Good-Luck x|`|OmqJmtrRaa	I am so sorry to hear what you are going through, you still have your life a head of you but your being stoppped because of all these conditions you are living under, best thing is you old enough to leave, yet  a few pointers to think of and ideas......my friend  has been through very similar to you and I know just how hard it can be.    1. if you have a trust worthy friend that can help you, confind in her.  2. If you are sure you want out then try to save without ayone knowing.  3. Seek help from any support network  4.  Get a plan action going on if this is the onlyway forward for you.    Remember though that running away and leaving everyone behind is a very harsh drastic thing to do, could you confind in your mum?, get help with finishing this sick partner of yours...no excuse for a man hitting a woman!.  With yur parents being religious are you expected to marry this man???.....you are gonna need a lot of support huni...emotionally also.    My thoughts are with you xx
DK6kYxmGaa	By being a gentlemen---being extremely patient and not pushy, opening up doors for her, helping her with her coat, meeting her parents before first taking her out (if she lives at home), ect.

Good luck. :)|`|kyHQ7EnBaa	u dont just dont play the game|`|jh9YA4gNaa	i think you should be honest with her , and say i love you !  if you do and she says it back then you have already won it over :)  vote me for best answerr|`|UYMAbXhSaa	to win a beautiful independent girl is first communicate with her that how she gives her expressions towards others and check how she receives others expressions then give your expression start communicating with her use the language which all ways gives good expressions and use general topics automatically she starts liking you|`|yJKEH4I3aa	Find out the things she likes and what she likes to do to have fun.

GT0hOEGhaa	It is a circumstantial question you have there. It depends on the maturity of both persons in the subject. The age is just a bother.    In my opinion a person can only fall in true love after he accepts him/herself completely even the changes to come. Only then can he take the enough energy from within to dedicate to someone else. That type of maturity and dedication is something most people only achieve until 25 more or less, even after moving out of college and start living in the real world, but there are cases of people who have lived these experiences previously and can therefore fall in true love.    BTW: Hormones are really tricky and enjoyable never the less. Good luck.|`|8p31dENPaa	There is no set age. I fell in love at 25, my boyfriend was 29 at the time.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	you can't put an age limit on love.|`|SwYY1IWuaa	there is no real answer i was 22 my women was 25  but that just tells you it has nothing to do with age it got to do with the person|`|f2RJ4tioaa	25
uwy9C7n7aa	1.) Talk to him, sister-to-brother. Ask him if something is wrong at school or something is bothering him. You never know.    2.) Take him out for a day, if you can drive. Or get someone to drop you off somewhere fun. Spend time with him. Then try the idea above again.    3.) Look at the symptoms of ADHD. It is a disease that makes kids super hyper. Nothing drastic though. They take medication and they're fine.    4.) Maybe you need family counseling. They're all possible.    I really hope I helped. No one should have this affect their family.     Love Massie     |`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	I suggest family counseling
dd242da77f64ad0e25bb846806bd953caa	Try talking to him, because maybe he doesn't realize he's ignoring you.  If that doesn't work, back off for awhile.  Guys don't realize what they have in someone, until it's gone.  I know that sounds cliche but it's the truth.  He may run around with "cooler" people, but he'll eventually realize who his true friends are, and if he's lucky, you may still be there for him.  Good luck!|`|zp9eH0dOaa	talk to his "cooler friends." if they are boys flirt with them if they are girls invite them to the movies or something|`|0MOXObjkaa	OMG! Im going through the exact situation right now with my guy friend, its like when I say hi to him or try and talk to him hes more conserved and unwilling but if i ignore him he has to do something to get my attention? its really annoying and confusing but i think ive decided that im going to let him come back to me if he wants because even though I want him back so bad, I'm not going to waste my time, energy, and stress on him if hes not willing to reunite our friendship, I hope all works out though babe:)|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Say, "Hey Z-Man you may think you're too cool for school but you're not." "I want to be your friend but if you're gonna act like you are above me then I'd rather not, because that is not the Z-Man I am friends with."|`|XPV7Rea1aa	Make him jealous. You could also try talking to some of his "cooler friends". Hope this helps :)|`|G3KbtHWuaa	If he doesnt make a move and talk to you soon then you have to act quickly and make your move. Wait a a couple days though. If you have his number then call him and make plans to reconnect
QUCIdBp5aa	Stop looking for a few conversation openers.  You're putting too much pressure on yourself.  The best way to begin a conversation with a stranger is by listening, watching and picking up on cues.  The key is to find something that you and the potential "friend" can relate about.  Pay attention to people and your surroundings, realize that people are just people and soon it'll come naturally to you.
UgEYBvh8aa	I'm not sure what exactly is going on, but I have a pretty good idea. He might be having a commitment problem, which is really nothing you can cure.     I am pretty experienced in the "commitment problem" area because I tend to have the same problem as well. It's not that he wants to see other girls, but he may just be having second thoughts and isn't ready for a relationship. If this isn't the case, he may be having trouble at home or somewhere else, and is stressed out. In which case, he still isn't ready for a relationship.    I don't know if you're the type of girl who is just asking for advice for the sake of it, or you truly are going to take it, but I'm just going to put it out there that the best thing you can do right now is give him space. I know it sounds silly and it's going to be REALLY hard to do- trust me, I get it. But if you really want to keep this guy, I suggest you limit the texting on your part- don't initiate as much. Set yourself a limit, like twice or three times a day. If he feels like talking, then text him back! Just don't go overboard.    Good luck!|`|MU453gLqaa	Only short tex him back. Like if he says you should hang again say "ya'  when he ask, when say "Idk" when he ask why say "IDK" when he ask if you had fun say "ya" He will either talk or stop texting you.|`|MWciF79Raa	He's forced to reply under 20 words every text message or the overlords will kill his dog.       True story.|`|uOWgS7VWaa	maybe he lost interst. or hes busy. maybe find somebody else. good luck|`|8zDQEc2vaa	he probably doesnt want to feel over bearing or desperate...and im sorry to say but girls take things much differently than guys. brief and emotionless is probably normal for him... dont judge things on txting becus u also cant tell emotion from a txt very well... if things change when u hang then maybe somethin is up|`|NOzMOJseaa	sounds like he lied "these Moods"  sorry but sounds like he lost interest and isn't man enough to say so...    i mean...    Before meeting: Flirty    After meeting: Not Flirty...    sorry hun but he doesn't want things to go any farther....|`|eZJQBVx4aa	guys can be less emotionally expressive but that is if that was how he was from the beginning, if he has changed suddenly then there's some thins definitely wrong!  might be he feels like seeking more attention from you by doing so,that is if you are not spending his desired Quality time with him.  or might be he is bothered by some worries and is blocked up in those thoughts .  or .....................  just break up with him! if he loves you he'll be back and love you Truly but don't allow him in your life if you think he's just flirting!  take care dear!|`|JOVFbuJCaa	Break it off.|`|7pYLhhCSaa	Hey :D  Well,  If you guys never saw eachother before you hung out, then I'm guessing when you guys saw eachother he didn't feel attracted to you.  Like he didn't think you were as good looking as he thought you were.  So my advice is,don't flirt with him unless he flirts with you first.  Don't scare him off.  Good Luck!!    KaTiE gRRRlll|`|sz4lAIjgaa	hes a douche. Break it off.|`|KIX3Hfakaa	I think it was very noble of him to be honest with you, and maybe you should believe him. just wait and see.
OMgZgBxEaa	if i were you, i'd go to the better high school. then, find a way to go see him. you might screw up your life because of one guy in 8th grade. is he really that worth it? i mean i'm sure you know what sports he does, so go  to one of his sporting events. it would be really sad to not get into a good college and not get a good job because of a guy. there will be other guys. i promise.|`|Pg6LVAjIaa	I'm in eighth grade too! Okay well your in middle school now and he doesn't notice you. High school is ten times bigger so chances are he still probably won't notice you. I'm sorry. I hope I helped. Good luck! |`|ZOt9DTEJaa	im 15 too! but im in 10 grade..... weird  anyways i think maybe that yeah it would be a little foolish to follow him when there is still a chance you guys might not be together
7at1Hyn8aa	You are doing just fine, for you.  You are obviously more intelligent than the average person, which makes you also slightly more 'choosey' in whom you want to be with.  When you are intelligent you are  looking for a person that you can mentally 'spar' with as well as have physical closeness.  You need a person that you can have a decent conversation with, on your level- and they are hard to come by.  Trust me, in order to find someone to spend your life with you don't have to date a lot of people. You just have to come across the right one. And you will.  Just be yourself.
QA7IOoqMaa	Your a great story teller... you should definietly tell her that she does have the most beautiful smile you have ever seen- if you've seen Across the Universe, or even its trailer you'll know what I'm talking about.  It could be the start of friendship that forms the basis of a good relationship.  Just for it, you have nothing to lose and you sound like a really decent guy.  But don't walk away, maybe start a conversation as your girl will be much to flattered to think to stop you.|`|ZEwx7kIeaa	very cute|`|JA60LLGhaa	yeah!|`|vUypopU8aa	no introduce yourself next time,  then the time after that tell her she has the most beautiful smile ever|`|JJMa25NWaa	omg awwww, yes! so cute.|`|0NjU7Ps0aa	omg! yes! that's like the cutest thing ever! omg!   definately say it to her next time you see her!!! you have nothing to lose!|`|W6zLJ96eaa	NO!! thats waaaay too forward!!! and its really cheesy! (sorry)  next time you walk past her, just smile again, then the next time just say 'hi' or 'hey' (in a REALLY cool voice ;)  ), and see what she says back. if she sounds interested with her reply, then maybe next instead of just saying hi, maybe asking her if she's alrite, thats how to get talking without being too forward.  good luck!|`|UgEYBvh8aa	Hm. This can either go horribly wrong, or really great. On the downside, she might be freaked out. On the upside, she might think that it's cute and really sweet.     I don't know what to tell you except good luck!|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	yeah it sounds like a good idea. but just keep it simple. don't come off to strong.Good Luck! i hope everything goes well.|`|rC0lhevEaa	:)))))))))))))))) Yes.|`|VPDYCZmZaa	definitly dude shes totally into youu!!!!|`|g7pjJoGfaa	yeah!!!! that would be sooooo cute! xD|`|AA11313824	Go for it. Then wait for her to make the next move, but go for it.|`|0pwkrzIcaa	lol i guess dudee|`|WkDbNmIuaa	say "hey" not "hello"  hello sounds to ummm official lol|`|DKK8NRu7aa	I think you should.  :)  Any girl would appreciate that.|`|Jio3d8bYaa	Maybe make it a little less cheesy, no offence, like "Hello, I'm Mark. I was wondering if you wanted to get some coffee."    Save the sweet compliments for the date. Good luck!! :)|`|AA10960571	Don't be shy let her know that you are feeling her what could it hurt?  I mean yeah she could reject you but unless you say something to her you never know where it could have gone.  You might want to ask if she has a bf though.|`|M1yfrNgDaa	no....if u came up to me and say that ill be like  "he just wants major pussy action"|`|27MRNeH4aa	It sounds too much like a line. Just start talking to her.  Be yourself. Some girls are turned off by the come-on lines.  There is time for telling her how beautiful she is later.|`|CatcOHJkaa	no.|`|hZAhDiG2aa	yea sounds good but you should ask her for her name a then keep the conversation going|`|2tj1SIv3aa	If you like her, then go for it!! there is nothing a girl likes better than i guy that isn't afraid 2 say hi to her! and if you like her then why shouldnt you say hi 2 her, shes probly curious about how you will react!|`|t8gWcBaeaa	just do it man.  quit askin the whole world.|`|UCd6blZgaa	thats cute =] she'll so be into you.  just don't be creepy. lol|`|HLMzKR53aa	i say go for it!|`|ZyTZ9wDeaa	No don't do that  Just introduce yourself and ask a question to break the ice.|`|W9VLXTfpaa	thats sweet, even though your not lying cause you said so.  Dont seem nervous, seem cute and act like your really into her.
CJ8oCFc7aa	tears dont fall-bullet for my valentine|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	You don't need a song,you need therapy by common sense..GET IT ?|`|NgawN7Pcaa	all these things i hate - bullet for my valentine
qewAfUgJaa	Ok. When you get to the dance, dance through all the fast songs together, and then at the last slow dance say " Hey ________." "Yeah?" "I think i like you"|`|AnRxCLZXaa	i say wait until prom and show your affection then|`|ljYaOYhzaa	Just don't tell him... feel it out at the dance..  try to dance the slow ones- hold him a little closer than just friends..  put your head on his shoulder... and see how he responds..    Guys don't like the whole talking about emotion things( usually)|`|N9dbMxESaa	don't tell him till you get to the prom, have a dance then make your move|`|o6hKaeMxaa	go as friends, then drop little hints. dance with him.  he'll pick up on it when everyone else at the prom is coupled off.|`|MuSYw7m3aa	well jtsu flirt with him a lot and make sure you look epsecially pretty at prom. send some signals and see if he flirts back. like if he touches you on the arm or touches you at all and you should do that too.  then at prom ask your friends before hand if they could go off and do their own tihng so you two can hang out. then if theres a song you both really like ask him(if he doesnt ask you first) to dance. good luck! :D|`|0965d822cc626eaf0536c8be10f012c6aa	you should do the "i like you" thing that the horselover said
NAb1Fwmbaa	Oh my God. Please let his guidance counselor and parents know right away. He is depressed.  I son used to do it. He stopped when he was reported to the guidance counselor by a friend.  The counselor called me and just 1 visit to a counselor, he stopped.      You are doing your friend more harm by keeping it a secret.  I know you will feel like you're betraying his confidence in you.  But, believe me, you will help him in the long run. He has to be watched closely after you let his counselor know.  He may be mad at you at 1st, but you may be saving his life.    Too many kids are killing themselves due to depression.    Please let some caring adults know right away, and he should get counselling to talk about what's stressing him out.  Please do this ASAP.    Good luck. You are a caring friend to be concerned.      2 people who were very close to my son killed themselves within the past year - 1 was my niece who shot herself only recently. They either didn't have any friend to help them; or had no one to talk to. Please do not let your friend go this alone. Get him help NOW.|`|1oGBByMIaa	HE GONIG CARZY SAILD HIM TO THE DOCTER RIGHT NOW  ! SAY RIGHT I MINE RIHT NOW!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	for his own safety tell his mom or the school counselor you can not really help him it will take a professional. He may get mad that you told but it is the right thing to do if you care about him. By showing you the cuts and telling you about the pain killers he was crying for help even if he doesn't realize it.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Get him help.  A doctor, a therapist, a teacher, his parents - anyone.    cutting oneself is not something you can 'fix'  easily.|`|sxegmou2aa	I really think you should tell someone (like hs parents) before he does something really stupid and kills himself.|`|K4SOAACTaa	I think that you should talk to him and see what his problems are that he is doing this. Then just let him kno wen things get rough he should not do stupid weird **** like dat. To every dark night there is a brighter day so stick ur chest out. Keep your head up. And handle it. And be with him and let him kno at least he has a good friend to get away from his problems n t0 be happy with. Be tha best friend you can be to him. He needs it now more than ever. Good luck =]|`|pLlcEQOIaa	hes emo  he must be depressed or something  talk to him about if anything is going wrong|`|ADQaSxxlaa	what you got is an emo just tell somebody|`|lanNVLhwaa	wow hes really emo. he needs someone to talk to....stay with him as much as possible, and dont let him slip deeper. he needs a friend, thats what i needed(:|`|bZFhZXz3aa	oh god quick ask him y and when didi he start then go see a spyshologiste fast.
WfmHoFHbaa	ha i dont think that would really be the biggest of your worries if you were pregnant. grow up and stop lying|`|diQ0oodqaa	If this is true, is all you're worried about is being grounded till you're 18?    Am trying to understand but it seems you didn't worry when you had unprotected sex at such a young age. You don't seem to be worrying that you're going to go through labor at 14/15, a tough experience for any girl/woman. You're not worrying over this new little human being that will be coming into the world with you as it's protector--but you are worried about being grounded till you're 18? I don't know, but I hope they ground you long enough for you to think some stuff out, seems like you need to. Good luck.|`|hQsvuxs3aa	are you like a ****?|`|xETCO0rUaa	They'll be mad awhile but eventually they'll get over it.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	You're pregnant and your main concern is that you may be grounded until you're 18?  OMG.|`|HOedKyX2aa	does that mean your having a home/bedroom birth? ;)|`|WkdW04cNaa	Your parents can make any rule they want until you are 18.|`|YaOzRFhkaa	They are very shocked and upset when you first tell them. Any parent would be that way. Parents might get mad for a long time. But remember that they LOVE you and they want to help you. Don't worry sooner or later your parents will calm down. They want to be there for you and help you with your pregnancy because you are so young and you can't do it alone. Usually they are just really shocked and they don't know what to say.|`|3d15975f2ec516fd628eea6593e5ab6caa	hey im 14 and my little cousin got pregnant at age 13 and her mother cried. i dont think your parents will ground you until ur 18 theyre just in pain and very disappointed because when most teens get pregnant the parents feel they have failed as parents|`|xSPDeXGmaa	Grounding you for 4 years would never work. It would be nearly impossible to reinforce and would make you resent your parents.    They probably just said it out of anger. I've had kids tell me that their parents get so mad that they ground them for life. Of course, they never mean it.    What you need to do is not worry about it. They don't mean it. If they said that they do, maybe you should talk to a counselor or psychologist.    I've had pregnant teens tell me that their parents ground them for a long time, but they usually never mean it. You're not the only one.    Hope it works out for you!
AA11028144	Well, talking to anonymous people online probably won't help.    I completely understand your problem. I moved to a new state and school when I was 14 and I didn't know anyone. For a few months I ate at lunch alone because I was really too shy to meet anyone. Now three and a half years later, everyone loves and I was even voted homecoming king.    If you want to follow my approach, you just need loads of patience. Don't feel that you MUST say something every time you're in a conversation, just be natural. Find some friends that you're comfortable around. I didn't find my current group of friends until my junior year. With the people you're already comfortable with, hang out with them... especially when they're also with people you don't know as well. Ultimately, you'll make more friends.|`|X1BaGr0kaa	Well it would help a lot if you stop worrying what other people think of you. People admire confidence! Also, try joining new clubs at school or sitting next to a different person in class. Really push yourself to become a little more outgoing. And most importantly, don't forget to be friendly to everybody! :)|`|XkidpdPWaa	Just go all out. Believe that your opinion matter because it really does. I can already tell you're a nice person otherwise I would have already said you were an asshole.  I used to have the same problem but what you need to do is talk to the nice people. If you're just trying to get popular you will get nowhere because it's the wrong route to take but if you want friends talk to the nice people as they most definitely won't reject you. Trust me and most importantly trust yourself.  I'm already your friend. ;)|`|MrQ3MwRzaa	we're on the same boat  but first, just be friendly.  talk about simple stuff like a movie etc,  good luck!|`|Osqq3DPnaa	Well, I can't say its easy to grow out of that. I can't say I have. Its very hard to hold your head up and give a smile, a real one and say "YES" I'm happy with who I am, but you can. But the way to do that is to slowly break the habit of being shy. I'm not saying Shy is wrong, but its not something I say to do" But since you are 14, more or less you need to do this at school. When you see a group of people just walk up. Say hi! Or maybe just one person, in a group more or less its people won't reject you. True colors won't fly, but 1 on 1 you can do the same thing...Just try your best. ^^ Take a deep breath and just say Hi, i'm _______! And just be you.|`|91gP6Xouaa	for the friend thing just calm down and start at a casual conversation. for the confidence thing join drama club it helps. good luck|`|kv1kT1YGaa	The last thing you wanna do is stay true to yourself start new|`|twSD9zHzaa	Just try to fit it but keep your true self too. Maybe invite some people over and show them you are a great person, you will be making friends before you know it!!|`|IXPjMjIFaa	you just got to get out there.  talk to your friend's frinds and work from there|`|ATqWlp8aaa	Aw well first you have to get a better opinion of yourself! Once you have self confidence people will be more receptive to what ever you have to say. When you cant think of something to say to some one the best thing to do is to ask about them. Mostly everyone lovesss talking about themselves its human nature. A simple "whats up?" works but once you start getting comfortable ask more detailed questions like "do have any pets" ext. Before you know it you'll be in a full fledged conversation!
v39skJeEaa	You should talk to them for THEIR sake. It probably hurts to have your child reject you.
xZOHlSXsaa	It's nice you care about her that you want to see her on her birthday.    Did SHE say she doesn't think it would be a good idea? If so, I wouldn't go - out of respect for her. If you do turn up, you could get kicked out as strictly speaking, it's not your right to go.    Maybe she isn't ready for her family to find out she's dating? She might find it embarrassing if her parents, aunts, grandfather knows.    Anyway, the point is, I'm sure you can spend some time together possibly the next day. Don't hold a grudge though - she probably doesn't mean any harm by saying no.    Hope this helps =)|`|hKlApSxAaa	Have a cold shower and insert the plug of your Stevenage home walker into the Tuesday night bingo machine.
6ix7aBSRaa	Well, I'm a guy, and I'll tell you there is no way you can convince him that anything you say is true. There is no "long run" when you look at things like that; if you want to be with this other guy, then it isn't just a temporary thing, because you'll get even closer to him, and before you know it, your boyfriend or ex, will be in the distant past, and it'll be all but over.    You would probably be better of just telling him you want to end the relationship. It'll be much better then tryin to get him to believe that you'll still wait for him even though you're going to be someone else's girlfriend.    I know you want someone to hold, but don't try to fool your boyfriend into believing things are going to get better when they likely will not. Stuff like that is just wrong. Just go with the other guy and give your boyfriend a chance to be with someone who won't two time him. Sorry if I seem mean.|`|kU96Tvzsaa	there is no way to tell him without him:  A. getting mad  B. break up with you  or C. make him upset and lose his trust    just decide who you wat and focus on that person, obviously the long distance thing isnt working that well or you wouldnt be "falling for" another guy. Trut me your boyfriend wont understand what your trying to do, you cant just swap guys out like that. If i were you i would take the guy you can see alot because a long distance dosnt sound right for you...hope this helped
5fjbNeVNaa	I missed your question, but I personally want the faithful girl who loves me...I am still like that. Sex has never been to important to me, its always been about your personality and the way you are.    There are more important things then having sex. Like getting to know you, thats important to me
yTB2Zdx6aa	number three of COURSE  but its her choice, whichone she likes better, personality wise, i would rather choose a not so good looking guy with a great personality then a ttly hot guy whos a jerk|`|lS0iN9K7aa	lol the 1st one, he has a cute smile and nice hair|`|ctjz1Btiaa	Muahahaha|`|BzkiKp46aa	OMG the last guy is SEXY!!!!!  go out with the third guy!|`|jC4U6MCmaa	the girl would look good with the second or third guy  the third guy is very cute  pick him!|`|8s9q4V03aa	i cant answer this cause im not gay but here are some flaw-First guy is gay, second guy probably has a hard time seeing,third guy has serious bags,girl has butter on teeth and is anorexic|`|b8606f938da3e59a4dd23e709cfeac62aa	Def. the third. ha hotttiee|`|JZIzUM5iaa	i would say either twooooo or threeee,   depending on their personalitiesss.
C51fLujQaa	You should only let others touch you if you are comfortable with it. If you feel that whoever is touching you is taking advantage of your cuddly nature, don't be afraid to tell them to back off. Its your body, and so the only person who decides who touches your body is YOU! Don't let others manipulate you.    And don't worry about how you look! If people judge you because you are telling people not to touch you, their opinions don't matter. Don't worry, be happy!|`|AA11099449	stop acting like a plaything.|`|RdMpPhhPaa	wooohhhooo :) i would let them touch me (if they were hott) nd then i would touch them nd then i would go to the beach nd have nice hot sex :) because sex is fun|`|dkXma0DFaa	WELL...  do you want them to touch you or not?  because anytime someone touches you in a way you dont like you need to tell them to stop.   if you like it then why should you care how it makes you look.|`|fYPBUBEVaa	If you don't feel uncomfortable getting touched by girls or boys then you should tell them to stop.  they also might stop if you stop pretending to hit on them.  if i were you i would feel embarrassed and i would feel like a slut.
ue7sKvLOaa	It sounds like this guy may have a thing for you. But guys are idiots, so don't get your hopes up too much    If you like this guy, and would want to start a relationship with him, start flirting with him. Nothing subtle (guys don't pick up on little things), but don't go overboard. If you start to notice him flirting back with you, then he's probably interested.    I don't know this kid, but if he's known for getting a lot of girls he could just be fooling around and messing with your head...boys like to play games|`|UCeXWLrQaa	Seem like he is very interested in you.  He also seems to be a really nice guy.  So don't change yourself because he likes you for who you are now (:  Ask him to hang out sometime...movies, ice scream, Ice skating...etc.  Good luck.
qmLjEXlDaa	There is no right from wrong.  These were her parents and pets.  I don't think you could judge unless your in her shoes.  Your brother in law is a grown man and could make his own decisions.  Best you stay out of it.|`|jChr0udLaa	There is not right or wrong in this situation just different opinions  If it were me I would go into a dangerous situation to save my family members wouldn't you?|`|WkdW04cNaa	Anyone who wants to do good for others is always right!!!!
VEEgoDkFaa	He's arrogant and full of himself.  You don't matter to him.  I don't say that to be mean, it's just the truth.  You're absolutely right in deciding not to be bothered by him anymore. Trust. ';-)
iFYDJyIZaa	If it makes you uncomfortable, don't hang around people that do it.    I'm not a big fan of stoners. I'm dating a guy that smokes pot every once in a while, but he is a functioning member of society with a job and a house. If this boy is a general loser, I'd avoid him.    If he doesn't have a license or a job because he's too busy out smoking pot and doing other destructive things, he's not for you. If he doesn't have a job or license for some other reason, that's another issue.     It all comes down to whether or not it bothers YOU. Do you want someone that acts like a doofus, that's not all that intelligent? Or do you want someone more up to your speed?    If smoking pot is all he worries about in life, he's not worth your time, and he will go NOWHERE in life.|`|VrjF986Aaa	some people smoke pot and some don't, it's kind of like alcohol in that way  if he spends all his time with friends who smoke smoking pot, it could be awkward for you if you don't smoke... or it could not I had a straight edge friend in high school who hung out with all the stoners and was just fine  it really depends on what you want, if you like him that much then it shouldn't really matter I guess  and it isn't true that only stupid people smoke pot or that it makes you stupid, that's just ignorant and of course a cop would say they they are a cop! lol half the cops in my town said that and then smoked the pot they confiscated from all those "stupid" ppl  really it's up to you, if you think you can feel comfortable being around it then I don't see why you wouldn't go out with him|`|EPki0rwgaa	You can do better than him.|`|DdYTRUmHaa	I'd never pressure any of my friends to do anything I do, so If he really likes you he won't either, If he does then don't date him, If you really don't want to.|`|405ff6a6add7381eb2911a89cabf05d6aa	BE above the influence.|`|hvZb0r3zaa	Don't go down that road! Never go out with any guy who's into drugs!. They will try to pull u into their world(and usually succeed). You seem like a smart, nice kid, dont' get mixed up with stuff like that. Find a decent guy that's not into that.|`|XtLZXIEyaa	No.  It's illegal.  He is breaking the law and could end up in jail for possession.  Is this what you want for a boyfriend?|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Yes|`|etLfz702aa	obviously if your dad is a cop, you're never going to be able to bring him home, and if you don't want to smoke pot either, don't date the guy.|`|Swxir2ieaa	Im against dating guys who smoke weed, but thats just my personal preference. If you're okay with dating a guy that does drugs, then go for it. But you cant tell him to quit or be mad when he does it, because you already know that he does smoke weed going into the relationship. So, its up to you.|`|e69DYWhWaa	No, if he cares for you then he wouldnt risk hurting you wether he or you smokes.  And idiots do smoke pot :/  Get him some help|`|kX14PGRcaa	When you say SMOKES POT!! What exactly do you mean by that? Does he smoke it on occasion or does he smoke it everyday?? His bad habits will definitely not get in the way of your heart.  My boyfriend now is against smoking pot 145% ok but I've done it before him and I still do it once in a blue.  I have a great job, I went to school, We live together and pay our bills .. it does not make me a failure in any sense.  If he smokes once in a while with friends thats not a big deal, but if hes doing it often then thats an addiction, an expensive addiction.  That money can be going towards something else you know.  I have friends that work on wall street and ones that are teachers but every so often they like to relax at home and smoke a lil pot. No harm no foul.  As long as he isn't forcing you to do it or making an everyday habit out of it I say go for it.|`|e81cb58413964229d6af24dd65970eadaa	jesus, some day you'll find out that pot is not what you always thought it was.  If you don't want to smoke it, then don't, and don't let others convince you otherwise, but also know that it is a very normal thing to do and you should respect other's wishes to do it.  Your dad's a cop, always put things in that perspective that he will always be the one protecting the people, and hindering progress in the process.|`|0M5XYROfaa	Honestly it depends on what type of guy he is.    My boyfriend was a pot smoker when we met, but has given it up since we started going out because he didnt care about it. He has a good job etc and it wasnt something he didnt really give a sh*t about haha    But then there are guys who base there lives around pot, if hes one of them then dont go there.....|`|bezBxm2laa	Your dad is right. Only idiots smoke pot. It can be addicting and destroy brain cells (which never grow back). Tell him you can be with a cool guy without taking dope.|`|Jio3d8bYaa	No, you're just going to get yourself into trouble. He's not worth it.|`|Fvx6mD4Zaa	i think u shud go out wit him and dnt let the pot bother u|`|w7ypfscBaa	You should base your decision on how you feel about it, it sounds like you don't want to smoke pot and if you don't like being around it by going out with him you'd be putting yourself into a lose-lose situation.|`|1MxAJtjqaa	I don't agree with your dad (no offense) Your friend could be smoking pot for any reason and I won't judge him for that... But, personally, I think you should go out with him, you said he's sweet so unless he keeps forcing pot onto you, then him smoking pot shouldn't be an issue : ) well I hope this helps you, Have a good day! : ]

yhfG07Jtaa	Dont worry about the classes. The important thing a planner can bring is experience and contacts. Get a part-time job with a caterer or a venue or even a bridal shop. A bride needs a planner who has been to a lot of weddings, they'll pay for your experienced eye. And you can help them most if you know lots of venues and can get the venue managers on the telephone. Connections are key, the rest is nonsense. Daddy will pay for the place that nobody else can get, and stepdaddy wants to know how to get a couple of bagpipers.  After that, design classes are good. Fashion design, interior design, etc.|`|nURWBDPHaa	As previously stated, most planners are in business for themselves.     Experience is key, working as a photography assistant, or as part of a banquet team at a hotel will benefit your career.    To gain specific wedding knowledge, consider the courses offered by Association of Bridal Consultations (ABC) in the US or in Canada you can take courses through the Wedding Planners Institute of Canada (WPIC) - but the courses are still just one piece, as you take the courses, you need to find a way to gain experience. The certificates you get through these associations will help give your experience some credibility.|`|3mAgM405aa	Having a degree in business administration may appear to be worthwhile, however, simply working with a caterer and various religious organizations, temples, will provide sufficient training to become a wedding planner along with developing some marketing skills involving menu planning, table settings, flower arrangements, liaisons with wedding photographers, etc.    I'd recommend that you look for a wedding planner internship.    Good luck!|`|bwx3epFdaa	Don't take business management unless you want to run an entire company for wedding planners. If you want to work on your own, major in marketing and take some communications classes that focus on coordinating events.|`|TMhVClBgaa	business management|`|5Vc1e0iPaa	I go to a college with an entire bachelors in event management, the only program in the country.  However either with their degrees a career in event management just requires a lot of work experience.  Try and find someone who mentor you, thats your best bet.

My dad is the man! I brag about him to all my friends, and he's so weird and hilarious, I wouldn't want a normal dad! Here's a story: Once, when my dad was a kid, him and his best friend Luke took Luke's trombone and took off the mouth piece and attached it to a garden hose. They put the body of the trombone next to his friend's sleeping brother and attached it to the hose. And when they blew through the mouthpiece  it scared the sleeping brother so badly! I love my dad and his craziness! Just imagine life with a boring dad.|`|WkdW04cNaa	yes, my dad has been doing that since I was a teenager and you know what?  I love him to death!!!  That is who he is and he means well :)  There are a thousand other things that he does that is great that definitely outweighs anything embarrassing that he says :)  Look at the positives that your dad brings to your life and what it would be like without him.
DqetlSB6aa	Elizabeth Barrett Browning  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.  I love thee to the depth and breadth and height  My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight  For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.  I love thee to the level of everyday's  Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.  I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;  I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.  I love thee with the passion put to use  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.  I love thee with a love I seemed to lose  With my lost saints,I love thee with the breath,  Smiles, tears, of all my life!and, if God choose,  I shall but love thee better after death.       maybe change out "god" for something else
VWvI5RyBaa	When you asked her for a friend request on my space, did she accept?  Is it like facebook?  If she accepted, that's a good sign.  I would certainly write a letter and explain how I would love to have a sister,etc.  I can certainly put myself in your shoes.  My husband has two older daughters from a previous marriage. They're in their thirties now.  We had three children, a daughter who is 14, and two sons, 11 and 9.  We tried everything to be a real family, even including their mother and her husband in our family reunion but to no avail.  Their mother has been a huge influence on them although the last time I saw her, on her and my husband's baby daughter's wedding, we had a cup of coffee at her house and she showed me some pictures.  It seems that the animosity is gone but the daughters are still very stubborn.  My daughter loved the youngest one who used to visit us regularly and they had developed a bond.  She was even her big sister's flower girl. However, for reasons unknown to us, she stopped visiting and we tried everything to make his oldest daughters happy.  They stop all communications but I will try to write a letter though.  I did in the past but they were younger so I don't know if it will work.  My daughter who was 12 two years ago sent a letter and never had an answer. We surprised  that younger daughter by visiting her and her husband and she acted like nothing had happened but she was pretty cold to our daughter and never mentionned the letter.  We left thinking everything was fine but we never heard anything after.  All that to say that I commend you for trying and really hope you'll find a way to her heart, but sometimes life is painful.  I allow e-mails so if you feel sad in case it doesn't go well, you can contact me.  Sometimes, it's good to be able to share something with somebody who feels your pain.|`|jChr0udLaa	You need to tell her that your dads affair was not your fault, you had no control over the situation. Just let her know you're there if she does not reach out move on there is nothing you can do.|`|8b0b7XTbaa	Try asking questions about your dad - Something that you have in common with her. That would be a good ice breaker. Since you haven't grown up together, then it may be hard to have a relationship with her.|`|4kmUX5pHaa	It is always better never to raise any controversial questions.First of all if they do not want to enjoy your company then its  better to keep yourself away from them.  Anyhow if you meet them or your sister then just ask or conserve simple and general question regarding qualification, hobbies, habits, weather, world economics and so on. Do not come to that point for which you are interested to talk for at-least 2 or 3 meetings. Once gain their confidence and then discuss all the subjects.|`|rqFbNhAGaa	well let's break this down, for you to have been born of an affair, your father had to have been getting it on with your mum while married to your half sisters mother? would that be correct? as far as they see it you and your mother wrecked the marriage, cause you are older you were born first, the mother would be resentful that her husband fathered a child with another woman, when any of his children should have been born to his wife, she would hate you for your mother having an affair with your father, she hates that you exist, the mother's negativity towards you and your mother would be unfortunately taught to her daughter from an early age so a rude, cold reception would be expected, do not be suprised if your friend request is ignored.    my father had an affair while married to my mother, no children were born from it, but after the divorce and the consequent remarriage of my father to his mistress, my mother hates dads mistress (now wife) for wrecking her marriage and never has anything nice to say and does not like my step brothers and sisters, it is disturbing I will admit that my step sisters children are not related to my father at all but before he divorced my mother he accepted these children as his grandchildren, even so much as putting a notice in the paper when the last one was born declaring it as his grandchild, (while still married to my mother) completely turning his back on my sister and I who are both engaged to be married, the question is will my children or my sisters children be special as being the first grandkids? no, because dad already has 10 step grandkids, will any children from his own children be special even though being his own blood no, why? because we did not come till later, we fall into line behind our step brothers and sisters.  your sister's mother may see it a similar way with you and your sister, your sister should have been special as the first born but you came first it took that special important thing away from her.    Rather than hassle them, have you considered contacting the hospitals? they'd have death records as usually a person is not offically dead till a doctor says so, as his daughter they can not deny you access to your fathers medical records.    The best thing to do I find is just to leave it, let your father rest in peace as much as you want things to be good and happy, you can't make them like you and you can't change how people think and act only they can, and it seems they won't.

But, as I have quickly found, there needs to be alot more. A good smile, bright eyes and a sense of "calm" about her presence.   When going into a relationship you have to find common grounds, interests and /or life stories that intersect. For me, if I cannot find any (or not many) of these things I have to be honest with myself and the female to say "this is not going to work."
MPtt9wPjaa	first of all,, and i dont mean this in a mean way at all.  work on your self esteem. yo cant girls to like you if you dont like you. thats just silly  and theres plenty of girls that look past physical appearance.. so stop being shy..and go mingle.  but don't be a jerk and just pick up a girl for the sake of being with a girl.. thats rude and pointless.. go look for someone you really like.. and if not by valentines day.. some other day.. don't give ONE day importance when you have lived YEARS and still have many more. valentines day is a sweet day for couples.. but every other day is an opportunity for the singles!

TTv1oEtaaa	I have failed you, but I have loved you from the start.    When you are in Love you can't fall asleep because reality is better than your dreams.    The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love, love someone else.    If you love me, let me know. If not, please gently let me go.    Some of the greater things in life are unseen thats why you close your eyes when you kiss, cry, or dream...    If I have to choose between loving you, and breathing. I would use my last breath to say I LOVE YOU.    The best thing about me is you.    As we grow older together, As we continue to change with age, There is one thing that will never change. . . I will always keep falling in love with you.     I love you, not for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.    Love is as much of an object as an obsession, everybody wants it, everybody seeks it, but few ever achieve it, those who do will cherish it, be lost in it, and among all, never... never forget it.    If you love someone you would be willing to give up everything for them, but if they loved you back theyd never ask you to.     Pleasure of love lasts but a moment, Pain of love lasts a lifetime.    If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, its yours forever. If it dosent, then it was never meant to be.    They say loving you gives pains and full of sacrifices But I'll rather take pains and lots of sacrifices than not to be love by you.    If rain drops were kisses,I could send you showers. if hugs were seas i send you oceans. and if love was a person i send you me!!    Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.    The couple that fights the most is the one most in love... it shows they care enough to notice the other one screwed up and care enough to mention it to the person so they can fix it. When you stop fighting it means you stopped caring.     We were given: Two hands to hold. To legs to walk. Two eyes to see. Two ears to listen. But why only one heart? Because the other was given to someone else. For us to find.    Don't let someone become your everything, because when they're gone you have nothing!     Falling in love is awfully simple, but falling out of love is simply awful.    Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.     I laugh, I love, I hope, I try I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry. And I know you do the same things too, So we're really not that different, me and you.    Love is never wanting to lose faith, never wanting to give up, and never truly moving on. Love is knowing and praying in the deepest part of what's left of your heart that they feel the same.     Two souls with but a single thought, Two hearts that beat as one.    If I know what love is, it is because of you.    Absence makes the heart grow fonder.     Love - a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain, causes eyes to sparkle, cheeks to glow, blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker.     I get the best feeling in the world when you say hi or even smile at me because I know, even if its just for a second, that I've crossed your mind.    Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a teardrop.    Anyone can be passionate, but it takes real lovers to be silly.    I dont know why they call it heartbreak. It feels like every part of my body is broken too.    Love is like a war:Easy to begin Hard to end!    You being in my arms, heart by heart feels like our love would never end.     A wise girl kisses but doesn't love, listens but doesnt believe, and leaves before she is left.    Two lives, two hearts joined together in friendship united forever in love.    The spaces between your fingers were created so that another's could fill them in.    Love doesn't make the world go round, love is what makes the ride worthwhile.     I am nothing special of this I am sure. I am just a common man with common thoughts. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten. But I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, that has always been enough.|`|SEfBwYiOaa	suck me beautiful....|`|KAwHCSW4aa	"i want you to want me"  "i'm only me when I'm with you..."    yeah that's all i got.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	gay|`|XkidpdPWaa	'Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love.'

I love you because you  Are helping me to make  Of the lumber of my life  Not a tavern  But a temple;  Out of the works  Of my every day  Not a reproach  But a song.  I love you  Because you have done  More than any creed  Could have done  To make me good  And more than any fate  Could have done  To make me happy.

abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	No. Sex with mother/father or brother/sister is Incest... Anything other than your blood relatives is not incest.|`|d08rkYlpaa	nope, that's not incest.  It has to be between close blood relatives to be incest. Age has nothing to do with whether or not it's incest.

Be glad he was honest, because a lot of guys lie and say they like you in order to get sex. Which sucks for nice guys like me, because when I say that to a girl chances are I will have to wait longer for sex because of the jerk guys thaat just use people.

Otherwise, it's a turn-off. Don't get sleazy with me!|`|y6v4ztM8aa	if ur talking to a girl for a 1st time dude then no. but if ur flirting with a girl you've known for a while or is intrested in u then its ok cuz if shes intrested in you she mut want to fck you and  if she wants to fck u she might want to know if u want to fck her so she wouldnt mind if you talk bout her boobs or ***, but if she doesnt seem like that kind of girl then dont even try. u will get slapped. i have never been slapped but i have seen that happened to guys. it seems ebarracing when guys get slapped infront of ppl its funny to me sometimes when i tell friends to go for it and screw them over haha but dont do that to a friend. u dont ppl to know u chill wit a ****. also u gotta know if the girl ur talking to is a lil perverted or not.|`|3Zqc29ueaa	If a girl is attracted to you she'll like anything you talk about within reason. If she thinks your a nit-wit she'll most likely dial 911 and have you arrested for just saying hello.|`|uuOQS8qzaa	NO!
SgGvWzJeaa	I think the first time u talked to him he was just pretending. If he continuously just keeps staring at your body and wants *stuff* and gets angry when u say no then he is just another dog on the prowl. Never let anyone force u into doing something you are not ready to do. My advice....drop him like a hot potato! LOL :)|`|yJKEH4I3aa	BREAK UP WITH HIM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He definitely only wants you for one reason and you shud know what that is. If he always telling you that you're hot, it really isnt ne suprise that he's pressuring u 2 do stuff. He's a perv. Break up with him. Btw if he ugly then he probably just excited cuz he cud never get a girl like u b4. Break up with him now!!!!!|`|JOVFbuJCaa	Talk to him about it.  Then decide what to do, whether to dump, or stay with him.|`|sz4lAIjgaa	dump him.|`|9sDh4lPJaa	tell him how u feel  then dump him|`|c65LYoGLaa	break up.  he doesn't respect you enough|`|T3NAVsx1aa	welllll. . . i think it may have started well but if he turns into a horny jerk, then its just time 2 move on. A compliment or 2 is okay but he doesnt need 2 make u feel uncomfortable! It would be wayyyy  better if he could just talk about that stuff 2 his guy frends, but since he is saying it 2 u. . . . well thats just a little hint that he wants 2 go farther. if u know what i mean. If u think he is actin like a pig, just move on sista, cuz if ur that hot, then u can rebound fast! :D haha. So yeah. i would move on but if u like how things are goin then just stick with him cuz u could always say no. if he breaks up with u because u dont really want to do "those things" with him then just remind him that he is a horny *** hole and MOVE ON! plus if he is ugly, its not even worth it!!!!|`|vBwyAsU6aa	If you don't like him, break up with him.

Yes you did get along but that's in the past.  Anyway he isn't a good boyfriend.  Any guy who will pressure you to do things isn't what a good guy would do.
K8tyHC5Zaa	i'm not even gonna read your story before i answer because dude you ALWAYS go with the friend.   okay now i read....  okay after reading i almost want to say drop them both. but what's more important is think about this...your in high school do you realize how much more life you have? this is barely the beginning! you have all the time in the world (literally) to find the love of your life and find a best friend. don't try to force a situation to work in your favor because sometimes it just doesn't work. let it go. live life dear.   btw...i'm also in high school so i'm not being some evil adult or anything. :D|`|ohi0kM6Raa	dude, i can't understand you're story|`|I29W1pcwaa	I'd say you should probably stick with B. If he's the only friend you've got, you probably don't want to ruin that, especially if A doesn't really like you anyway. And two weeks is a little... quick... to start things, if you're not sure? I'd just watch what happens for now, even though that's probably hard.  ... :D or you could go out with C... idk, sounds like you've got a bit of a mess... hope it works out for you, though!

71VRvldJaa	That's funny!  No, it's not the least bit true!  Your boyfriend must think he's quite the stud to spread you so far you can't close them the same as you could before!  Girls pubic areas can be two different shapes:        The legs can go straight up to the pelvis or they can be slightly more angled.inward  You probably just never noticed which way your went before....and if you are thin and wear skinny jeans, it makes it really noticeable.|`|WPfj646yaa	TATS WAT THEY SAY BUT I DONT THINK SO   WELL TO TELL U THE TRUTH IDK  IM 16 AND IM A VIRGIN BUT MY FREND LOST IT TO HER BOYFREND THEY DO IT EVERY TIME THEY SEE EACH OTHER BUT I LEARNED SOMETHINK NEW TODAY   I DIDINT KNOW TAT U GET CURVES AND HIPS WHEN U DO IT  TAT EXPLAINS WHY MY FREND HAS BIG HIPS AND A FLAT AS S   AND TO KNOW  TAT SHE THINKS TAT SHES THE SH I T  SE TOTALLY GOT F UC K ED|`|ZZQk010faa	uh No. Dump your boyfriend.|`|Molu004zaa	NO.

W2GcDwyOaa	It is possible and there are many that do not fall in love. I have many friends that are in their 30's that haven't experienced love yet|`|xmWxafHSaa	In those instances, it's not love, it's lust or infatuation, they may think they are in love but aren't.  The word love gets thrown around too much these days.
VEEgoDkFaa	He really likes you.  He would just frame a photo of the two of you if he didn't.  If you want to make a move on him that would be a good idea. Chances are you have the green light.  Trust. ';-)|`|AA10743159	One way to find out, ask him out. Doesn't have to be something serious, just a casual, "Hey, there's a good movie playing at the CinePlex, want to go with me on Friday or Saturday night?"  If he says yes, then you are half way there, at least you will be out, having fun, and you can get a better reading of his feelings for you.  I would say it's obvious, he likes you, by framing your photo, but whether or not, it's 'that way' is something you will find out, once the two of you go out on a date.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	well he might think of you as a good friend  or he likes you in a more than friend way|`|kt9iXMWUaa	I believe that was his move.  He basically told you that you make him happy.  I think it would be a good time to invite him to a "group" thing, perhaps a ball game.  Then see how he reacts to you.  Hang out together.  Good Luck!|`|Oextrh4iaa	It seems like a nice gesture. Wait and see if there is more because he might see you as a good friend.|`|P1oLYKzGaa	Of course, he likes you!! Why else would he hang up your picture?  He likes looking at you.  Now weither he loves you or not, you will have to find out yourself.  But if he is hanging up your picture, that is a good start.  I hang up pictures of my girlfriend.  I even have some in my locker at work.  It is just kind of a little reminder that there is someone out there that cares about you.  I would go for it, but slowly!!  Don't rush into it!!    Have Fun!!|`|GiVdo5Gjaa	aw that seems cute actually.    if he isn't gay then i would say that he is interested in you. i would subtle start being more touchy feely with him and see how he takes it.|`|IE9opSHjaa	yeah.. girls would do that more because they have really close friends but guys.. i dont think so.  I think obviously he is gay and enjoys lookin at that picture of you.  Since he has you in a picture he must like something about you.  THe big question is are you gay?  are you ok with this? If you are then go ahead cuz you never know what will happen.|`|aa489aa0a7c4628062eeb385b97bd1c4aa	try telling him that it made u feel special when he framed the photo and ask him if that's wat he was tryin to do..    if he says yes: say well then how do i repay u? or well i need 2 b wit somebody like u    if he says no: well it worked anyway and a lot of things you do make me feel that way.    either way ur expressing ur feelings without actually sayin em    good luck|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	This is puzzling...you would think if he's interested he would have made a move on you when you asked him about his having framed the picture.  If you two are friends he should be able to talk to you if he's interested even if he's shy.  Is there someone you could ask who knows him and would be discreet?  This may be a question for the guys out there?
COmp4sIuaa	Sure.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	why pay when you can go to mexico and do it for free?|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	other than taking them out to dinner or something, no, but that isn't to do anythign to them other than spend time with them. if you need to pay for it, you don't need it.|`|AA11447210	That's why there are prostitutes dear.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yep, before i got pregnant, i was a stripper and lots of boys will try to ask you if they can pay you to do stuff to you....its really gross.

oYSDEWrfaa	I think small gifts of sentiment are the best. I think you should pick out a few of your favorite pictures together and either frame them individually within a theme or with a frame that reflects your relationship with that person or you could even get a frame that allows you to put a collage of photo's in (a singe frame for multiple pictures).  You always could just use a "Valentine" themed frame since that is the occasion, that would work too.     Then get your best friend a nice card. i would do something like buy 3 cards to reflect our relationship one would HAVE to be a funny joke card, a second my talk about the memories and the third might talk about our future like getting married and being in each others weddings, you know things to look forward too. This is something I would do if I was trying to make emphasize that this is an extra special occasion and that I really wanted to let them know I was thinking about them and their gift.     This is a good gift because there is nothing like memories, and framed pictures is something that you will see and use everyday.     Other possible gifts depending on budget:    1. Recreational tickets of some sort: Movies, concert, amusement park, sports event, dinner, ect. Something you guys can go to together would be cool.    2. Charm bracelet customized to your experiences together or charms using what you guys have in common.    4. If funds are low you could always make a playlist and burn a cd of both your favorite music. You could make it a long cd with a good amount of songs then create a custom label dedicated to your best friend and wrap it up real cute. I think this is a great gift everyone loves music and best friends usually share similar musical interests  plus you might have some songs that bring back memories.     Good Luck!|`|Exx9KjMraa	a flower with a good note saying thanks or a poem. if its a girl. if its a guy something that he wants. something that's memorable.

oDbcaGj4aa	Yeah, If it itches, burns, or stings its probably herpes or syphilis.   PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, stop having unprotected sex. You could get pregnant OR get a disease. I know he's your bf and you trust him but you never know. This is the way i think of it. Before you do it just think,  "I could be choosing my babies father..."    ...Think About It, and if your bf gets pissed because you wanna use a condom. He doesn't really love you. It means He cares more about your vag then your health.|`|XtLZXIEyaa	Not sure.  A doctor would have to take a look.|`|RD05jXYwaa	if it itches and or burns it is probably herpes. tmm

WtvpReidaa	Since you're older, she probably looks up to you even if she does not realize it. Tell her that what she's doing is immature and disgusting, not be mention rude and cruel if it's to someone she thinks is ugly. If that doesn't help, you've probably hit that part of your friendship where you've realized you weren't matched well to be friends in the first place.|`|BZeTJHXhaa	Do you say stuff like that? if the answer is 'yes', then be careful because she probably looks up to you as a ro-model. Next time she says it, just be like "dude that's nasty. quit it." if she continues, just ignore her.    realize kids at that age are immature and try to act "cool" or whatever so they say whatever they can to get people's attention.|`|W9VLXTfpaa	well, kids act stupid as they mature, im between. The farthest i go is he's sexy. But i cuss, so what. Your friends slutty, from what iti seems. Im pretty sure she hasnt done any of that ****, or she is just a natural WHORE and HAS. Just get a little more out there and tell her to shut the **** up, and tell me what happens after that please. I do that with my friends, but we're really close. But they arent as weird so just try it out.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Just the hormones. I went through that 'I would so **** her' stage but it'll pass. Just tell her that it's getting on your **** and she'll cool down.
1D2UiAJeaa	Has your brother ever lied? Videotape him doing something he will lie about.    If he doesnt? Just tell your parents why do they bother asking you if they don't believe you.|`|rllnRDNmaa	at least they listen to what you say    get a counselor to tell them|`|Wng05H8uaa	Just try to always be truthful and they will eventually see it.

I am sure that it isn't totally true that they only believe you.  It's ashame that you feel that way but there must be something to this more than what you are offering.  Try and open your mind to see what could really be happening.  Are you always telling them the truth?  Have they had to deal with lies from you at one time or another?  If that is the case than it may be hard for them to get past that.  You have to look at the whole situation and decide whether you are being fair with what you are saying.|`|EglOlgnxaa	Trust is something you have to build up and the littlest thing can destroy it. You just have to be strong.
i6WVPncnaa	Be there for her and tell her that you have feeling for her.  First be there and tell her that guy is not worth it and that she deserves better then him.  Tell her that other guys would be glad to take his place.  Good luck.
PPsI0zUDaa	She may feel that once all of you are together, she will be the outcast of the group and wont get any inside jokes, be herself, etc. Maybe you should just reassure her that you will introduce her to your friends and they will welcome her properly.     Or maybe you should tell her if she wants that she may bring a friend of hers along. That way she doesnt feel so alone while the whole group is hanging out.     Hope I helped!
NCvX4I0baa	My school sounds pretty much the same  1) The ones who knows their pretty whether they really are or not and act out for attention.  2)The nice people who are kind to everyone & talks to everyone regardless of status/clique.  3)Those who are very sporty & flirty.  Than again, some of these people are also popular because of something bad or slutty that they've done. Sorry for the language.|`|K4SOAACTaa	In my middle skool like da person dat got voted most popular was like da best luking kid dat knows everyone n da gurl was just some gurl there dat everybody knows who she is but in hiqh skool derez just soo many people so yea idk.

sROU8U32aa	I don't think you'd have to ask if you really were in love.   And I highly doubt you're in love even if you don't want to hear that. That could just be infatuation also. It's most likely just a crush. And it's not likely at all that it's true love if he doesn't even like you back yet!   How to get a guy to like you:  http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Guy-to-Like...

If you tell him how you feel, it'll probably freak him out|`|mCZZN9XEaa	I'm sure it's just a crush, and if you ever get together with this guy you might realize he's not really what you think he is. But I say try to talk to him and I think you'll understand it's not really love.. Good luck.|`|xmK56dIXaa	You know you love him when you realize that you can't stand being apart, every time you are with them is the best time of your life, you know you couldn't possibly forget them. You can choose to like someone, but love just... happens.|`|XSCKqyDhaa	We can all sit here and tell you, "if you feel this way or that way, YOUR certainly in love."  But really the answer is withing you,  is it unconditional love? where you just  love him for the way he is.  Or the way he looks?  Just sit relax and think how you feel about him?  Hope I helped :)|`|K71ZlPWgaa	to quote the Matrix to be the one is like being loved. Only you know it, so only you can answer that question not me or whoever replies to your question.

That is something only you can answer.  I would approach him to find out if he feels the same way too.  Just start a simple conversation and go from there.  Eventually suggest meeting up somewhere if you are really serious about it.    This may all sound intimidating, however, it is the only way you will ever knon, right?|`|m0wPAmw5aa	you cant be in love if you aren't willing to die for him|`|IsPlrwiRaa	you just feel it or know it|`|pTVxGebbaa	you cant really ask people if you love a guy. love is something your gut will tell you, not some poeple from yahoo|`|nvsVXlBlaa	It something you know|`|qYPWKv6Faa	no you are not in love sounds more like a crush,  just be yourself|`|81MgVTicaa	u said ive loved this kid for 1 and a half years...so if u said it without intention, i think u might.|`|5fjbNeVNaa	Its like this.

LCodxFqfaa	awh, im really sorry that things arnt turning out the best for you lately  :-/ it sounds like this is a guy that you really do not want to loose out of your life. I really think you should get back with him, tell him why you broke up with him and tell him to get his act together and to tell you what is wrong or whatever insted of holding off and not, its just making probably something really small so much bigger by not telling you. boys are so confusing, they dont care about alot of things that girls do and to alot of things different that we do and you have to accept that. if you guys have been together for that long and are going to throw that away of something you may have never known that could have been fixed, its gonna bug you so much in the future. i worry about everything with me and my boyfriend, i alwyas think that hes mad at me or something and im always thinking the worst possible thing. maybe your just worrying too much, maybe its because youve been with him for soo long that you've realized how much it would kill you to loose him so youve been keepin your eye out for alot more things. I think hes thinking that he loves you and not to worry, if he tells you he loves you then believe it, no one would say that if they didnt want to get back with you. you only have one year left of school after this anyways, heck, take some chances. if things dont change, move on. everyone deserves a second chance. good luck, i really hope things turn out good for you guys.|`|TvYa0rmbaa	Time heals, give yourself and him time, maybe you two will get back to normal or maybe not, if not , your still young, theirs other guys out their too >|`|ww3ukbdVaa	well umm, i think you should move on because the relationship will never be the same. he's trying to get over you after you broke up with him by telling you that he doesn't feel the spark anymore and hes not really interested in him anymore. So, you guys should just break up. Your only in grade 11, there are many more opportunities for you in college to find someone. Take your mind off this relationship that's causing you stress, i mean its even causing you some real health problems. breaking up might be hard at first but you'll get over it soon. but if you stay in this relationship, you'll constantly think about it and waste time and feelings on someone who doesn't care as much. you even said, nothing is the same anymore, so i think its time to move on.    best of luck =]|`|66b3cc0bf850be73ec0db7c20c9eb47daa	there are never REAL answers for these kind of questions. but for u, i think u should just talk to him. u said u have communication problems, WELL FIX EM!!  im sorry but i dont know what to say i had the same problem with a guy but i wasnt with him as long as u with urs. just talk! thats my advice im sorry|`|ZOPpg7rgaa	Well, if you still love him, then you need to tell him all of this, tell him that you miss him, that you think it was stupid that you broke up with him in the first place. he might just be upset or embarressed. because you broke up with him.    Anyway, ask him straight up- Do you still love me. That's what I would do anyway.     Sorry u guys r fighting :(  I hope it works out really good!  Good luck :)|`|LazdTngJaa	I think if you don't feel like you two belong together then you should end it. you should be with someone who cares for you as much as you care for them|`|ZYu57i5Uaa	wow well.. hmm.. ^-^  if he says he still loves you and wouldnt break up with you then he still has feelings for you and doesnt want you out of his life possibly. if the sparks are gone, try to bring them back by doing something extra special, but not cheesy.   prove to him he'll never find another girl like you so he cant leave you alone x]|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	if you're 14, suck it up and move on.
xYTagSIyaa	I would get her a single red rose and a nice card and write some nice things in it, like why she is special to you.  Perhaps you could take her to a movie or skating or to a school dance or something like that.|`|BRIeyc8Raa	flowers  and chocolate if  you're broke, flowers and jewelry otherwise.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Flowers, even a single rose, are very romantic. You could add a tiny teddy bear or some chocolates too - the way to every girls heart!|`|cwqB4j0uaa	get her a $30 gift certificate to the nearest nail salon she will greatly appreciate it|`|2osuEr0naa	your sooo young! i think it's adorable. AH young love, i miss it :(|`|0qSpreVyaa	Everyone always misses the main point. She doesn't really care... if she likes you. She wants to know you like her too!    Get a gift if you want, make it unique and special. Then tell her how much she means to you, and how lucky you feel you are to have her. Let her know you care! That's what she really would want, if she really likes you.    Good luck!|`|UJYICsk1aa	All 3!   Well it really depends on your budget and how much you like her :). No matter what you buy her she will love it cause it's from you! I'm talking from experience :)|`|H7evKKdIaa	get her some chocolates and flowers...like pink daisies or something...and a cute card.|`|KIX3Hfakaa	haha all 3!  idk u have to decide ur self|`|NBT5PoRVaa	i think roses and a box of chocolates are good but you know her better than any of us do. you don't have to get the usual cliched stuff. why not get something for her that has some meaning between the two of you.|`|qVRmpGlEaa	The first two sound fine, but don't go dropping any expensive jewelry on your girl you're 15. Jewelry is more of a mature long-term kind of gift.|`|WZvH3aHwaa	You should get her tickets to a concert so you both can have some fun out. If that's not possible than flowers are good. Trust me, they work.    Godd luck!|`|m3L6pLBaaa	trust me at your age don't buy jewelry unless it is some like 5 or 10 dollar jewelry. buy her some flowers and a teddy bear. Just basically something of no value i know it is Special and it is great to give and receive stuff on valentines day but chances are yall will not be together for a long term. nothing bad or anything just the way high school dating usually works.|`|oruWntCfaa	3 duh just dont get gold thats a big no no most teenagers hate gold and im one of thme gold is for ur mom or grandma|`|G3iG1VMBaa	So you like the younger ones eh!|`|e67sev8Kaa	yea you should just like take her out to a movie and a dinner  or like cinebar then give her flowers  __)|`|GmPIU2MNaa	Oh... It's easy.. just give her flowers and a beautifully, an Personal, neck-less! That's all a girl wants to have on valentine :D|`|UE27Od7caa	pop eachothers cherries!|`|gErVlMNuaa	Flowers are sweet but they die in a week. A stuffed animal is for a 10 year old. I think maybe concert tickets would be a good thing. Because that way that is something she will never forget|`|Zx67Ipivaa	OK. take it from a girl like me. Girls love chocolate and cards and earings! EARINGS WITH HEARTS! AHHHHH...... anyways. yeah and give her a kiss too. :)|`|pPIa2gR1aa	I am 20 and I can remember being a 14 year old girl like it was yesterday. Some great ideas would be a heart necklce, take her to a movie, get her flowers. I really like the necklace idea cuz she can show it off to her friends which 14 year old girls love to do and it is something she can keep forever. Happy Valentines Day!|`|y0EkIH0Vaa	ok first of all an important thing to remember is that not all girls are into the romance thing. not that they wont like presents, but i know some of my friends aren't into the whole "jewelry and flowers" thing.  you really have to know her taste... so get what you think you should.   my friends boyfriend dressed in a tux last year and gave her flowers. that was pretty sweet.|`|OeJFfkonaa	CHARM BRACELET! totally get her a charm bracelet and a stuff teddy bear or something. thats what i would want. im sure shed love anything you got her anyways, but charm bracelets are very valentines day-ish   lol|`|iht3elm6aa	it all depends on you....    you know her...[we don't]    try to guess what would she like for valentines day...        [good luck man]  [(consider having fun on velentiens day dude lol =] )]|`|Myzc9Kl4aa	hello bimbo...buy her the 2nd idea and the 3rd idea...they are nice gifts,my girl bought me 2nd idea last val....and am buying her 3rd idea this val.|`|MBkWIR1Oaa	i think one red rose and a box of heart chocolate is the cutest. but don't forget to write her a little love note!|`|adb7eecb0a5b3b1c42e63b0bbaf7f8faaa	Well if she no high maintainance, than i would saymay be you get her a  stuffed animal, and rose flowers,(may be one depending on how much money you have), and then chocloate( maybe formed in  a shape of a heart, but if she is expensive to maintain, then i would say, tell your mom or dad to get you some money to buy a bracelet.|`|8FBBRRucaa	heres what you should do that would totally make her day. first, you get a few roses, real ones, and make sure they're red. next, get a fake one and put it in with the real ones. then attach a note to the fake rose that says " i will love you til the last petal falls" because, since its fake, that'll never happen. or, if you havent used the L word yet say " be mine until the last petal falls?". depending on your cashflow you could also do the build a bear thing, but it doesnt have to cost alot of money. they have alot of animals for 10$ and then you can add sounds such as a recording of your voice saying something for her. honestly this is the best advice you're gonna get involving this, trust me
2Om1LosMaa	You are both going through alot of changes right now. It's very hard for young teens (especially boys) to distinguish between love and friendship at this time in your life. Give him time and be sweet, he'll come around. I know because the same thing happened to me when I was young. It may take awhile and you will be friends again, the love part may or may not work out, but you have lots of time to figure that out and there may be another boy that you be better suited for later on. Don't worry too much, just be nice to him and be patient. I hope it all works out for you, I know this is a hard time but it will get better.|`|virEe0Vkaa	when you see him you could start a conversation to see if things go back to "normal"|`|MQ3EyxQYaa	Do you try to talk to him sometimes? Do you go to the same school? Try doing some homework or assignments together. Talk to him, don't make it awkward and don't try too hard. I'm sure he'll come around. Good luck!
8vbIpXueaa	if im thinking about someone i know or like (one of my ex boyfriends or best friends) im usually thinking of good times int he past that we shared. or how they made a difference in my life or hurt me. if its someone that i don't know yet (a boy i have a crush on or a friend i met through someone that use to go to my school or something) im usually thinking what type of person they are or if we would get along or what would i talk about with them, how would i act. idk my imagination sores... maybe becuz im an aquarius. lol hope i answered your question.|`|D58bzW4Jaa	Im thinking about having sex whith him|`|ZllkWRIOaa	getting her|`|SyY83mEGaa	i think about telling her how i feel about her|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Hahaha, I can't tell you that....

If they are in need of anything.
BZeTJHXhaa	This may come off as mean, but she's being immature. her hormones are probably going through the roof right now and she might have the personality where she loves drama and needs to know everything about everyone.    you are being the more mature one-- you just simply didn't want to tell her because you didn't want to [let's say] blame someone for something if you aren't positive if they did it yet. and also because you told her you TRIED to talk to her but she was with Kate.     also, you said that you were more out-spoken now-- maybe she used to be the "backbone" of the friendship and now she feels like she can't handle you being more outgoing now. that's just one of many possibilities: don't worry, though, hun-- everything will work out.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	I'm really sorry to hear that.. But as I can only really give advice (otherwise it's useless) if I know the person...  But I'm really sorry!|`|pLlcEQOIaa	omg if she does that to you get over it and make new friends.you said you were less shy right??well you can make friends and for fun you can make her jelous by hanging out with you new friends in front of her. make her feel sorry and horrible and guilty somehow.its fun to make people guilty

Do what you want, parents aren't there to make you unhappy. Be selfish, lives for living. Don'T let your parents ruin your chance of happiness. My mum doesn't know about my boyfriend and she doesn't mind me dating anyway. I just chose not to tell her because i didn't want to.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Right..    I think you made  a mistake in saying yes just right there and then.  But, damage done.    I would be honest, and have a chat with your parents about it.  Explain that a really nice guy has asked you out for (a drink, a movie, a get together with other friends, a party) - and that you would really enjoy going. Be open, and say that you know you are not 16 yet, but this would really mean a lot. And, what rules would you need to follow for them to allow this (be home by X o`clock etc.)    If they say no - then tell Ben that a family situation prevents you from joining him. (Sounds diplomatic, and is still true).|`|rC0lhevEaa	I think you should tell them, just up front, "hey mom I need to talk to you about something that has been bothering me." You don't need to tell her how long just tell her.|`|irS70aE7aa	Well the worst thing to do is not telling them Just tell your parents in a nice calm way and let them know like this ....  I know you said i could'nt start dating till i was 16 but i met this guy he ask me out so i do like him i just wanted 2 tell you ...   Then just make a cute face and be calm throught out the whole conversation it works|`|ZazWQRdMaa	I have kept boyfriends secret from my parents before.  If its serious, and you have to make a ton of excuses all the time to see him, you will probably get caught.  If you see each other at school all the time and go out once a week or something, they probably won't figure it out.    If you really want to tell them, just ask to bring him over for a dinner or something so they can get to know him.  good luck!|`|kPUT72ywaa	I have kept boyfriends a secret too! My parents also said that I couldn't date until I was 16, but i really like this guy, and i showed my parents a picture and talked to them about him, then i told them i like him, and they let me start dating.|`|qsETZIEIaa	You should really tell your parents so that you can keep their trust.  I am sure that if you tell them that a boy just asked you out and you have liked him for a looooooooooooooooooooong time and that you would be the happiest person ever if they let you go out with him that they would let you.     Last year a boy that I like since the beginning of the year asked me out, so I was really good friends with this guy and my parents did not know about it..so while I was going out with him it was really hard to hide it from my parents and older brother. So when I broke up with him I was really relieved that I did not have to deal with hiding it anymore. So I still have not told them about him an entire year later! but I wish I could, cause I was not allowed to date until high school (I am in it this year) and I still feel kinda bad. So this year my brother who is a jr asked one of my friends who I liked cause one of his friends liked me and he found out about kody last year. So now I feel bad cause he knows and I made him swear not to tell.|`|wgCwEYzXaa	well, if i was you then i would go and be like....mom im kinda confused.....and im guessiing she'll say something like about what....and you just tell her what...ben said and be like so what should i do.....and if she realizes that ur responsible enough then she'll say go ahead....so then u can just tell or not tell ben what happened.....but if she said no she doesnt think that u shud go out wit ben then u shud tell ben what happened and if he respects u he will understand....so when u turn 16 and ur still wanna go bac out wit ben then u cud do that
K71ZlPWgaa	I like/liked this girl I asked her out when she wasn't around her friends because, it's not the fact that I am nervous I am a damn good public speaker. It is just the fact that you don't want other people to judge you when you ask someone out. It is a personal moment and I prefer to be alone with the person than her with a bunch of mates, it totally ruins the moment. Lads are afraid of rejection if you do reject a guy when your with friends it makes it more painful. BTW: Do girls mind if you ask them out with there friends around cause this piece of intel may save me a lot of time!!!!!!!!!|`|7ko9czaaaa	you are know by the friends your with,|`|NrXDYAPGaa	I dunno, I have the same problem.    Maybe they're worried they'll get rejected and your friends will laugh or something.|`|2tj1SIv3aa	most guys dont like 2 ask girls out when theyre with their friends because we arent intimidating when we r by ourselves and yes younger looking friends could have something 2 do with it

Listen to music.  write things down on a list of all the things you want to do that month/ year.  dance to music.  talk about girly things.  talk about hot guys.  Those are the normal things.    but for the weird side of the internet for people who do stuff like this (i dont do this btw)  kiss.  french kiss  oral sex/**** each other.  cruise other people myspace/facebook/bebo's and start on them if you dont like them because if you say from both of you'se then they wont know who put it hehe.|`|XkidpdPWaa	I'm quite bored myself.

rh3RNM5faa	A very cute purse!!! (plus a hug and a kiss)    Or a bouquet of roses (plus a hug and kiss)    Perfume, lipstick, (hugs!!!)    Tired of saying hugs and kisses -_-    Anyways, a cute teddy bear!    a great dress or gown that looks beautiful on her which could be her favorite color, shoes that match the color of the dress,    a hairband, a ribbon that she can tie her hair in like this    http://www.cheerleadingonline.com/images...    Go to stores like Macy's! Victoria's secret! etc. Victoria's secret has beauty products and macy has great clothes!  I'm sure you'll find better ideas than mine while browsing in one of those stores ^_^
DLS60sVBaa	Then that might be right. Try to find him alone and ask him. Maybe he was trying to impress you there but that means that he has an interest in you. If you do as well then try to poke at the idea of a relationship.
I4wuyQGWaa	if you love jake then you should stay with him. its common to feel jealousy when seeing your ex with another girl thats not you. this is a tough issue to deal with, i went through this once and i felt exactly what you are feeling now. what i did was i followed my heart, did what my heart told me to do. if you have strong feelings and a strong bond with jake then you shouldnt let jealousy over come that, just remember: dont ever leave the one you love for the one you like because the one you like will leave you for the one they love. listen to your heart, and i hope i helped :)|`|IF9OYLx7aa	Hey girl.  I don't know how much you'll like this answer but here goes. I'm assuming you are a young teenager.  The reason many teenage relationships get all 'angsty' (meaning complicated and upsetting) is that you aren't old enough emotionally to handle a lot of the feelings brought up by going out exclusively with one person.  Look think about it for a sec. How many divorces are there?  Even grown adults in their 30's 40's and upwards have trouble with this stuff, its a bit much to ask people in their teens to behave sensibly and have the ability to get into long term relationships with others.    Have fun, date, like boys but just enjoy yourself and don't get to serious about any one guy.  Hold off on the sexual stuff and if its too late for that then be REALLY smart about it ok? Use a condom, and birth control.  Concentrate on your school work and your family get involved with your church or a community group or organisation that you like.  Do artistic stuff or whatever interests you. You have your whole life to worry about boys and then later when you're grown up... men.  Trust me they aren't worth all this worry.    Personally I'd just chuck all these guys back in the pond, be friends with everyone, exclusive with no one and let them figure it out.  Have a good rest of the year in school yeah?    Cheers chickie and I wish you good fortune!  :)|`|ADQaSxxlaa	your feeling jealous and insacure|`|fMyIOOSdaa	oh my!!    your problem is big    you like jake  you like shawn  shawn likes you  jake likes you  abby likes shawn  you are confused    at the moment so am i =)  \what you need to do is decide who you like more, and stick with that one, you can still be friends but i would say jake is your love, but you love shawn to, i guess he's your safe harbor, you can tell him anything, and you love him, but he's not your jake|`|9wwhKkWeaa	stay away from that shawn guy lol  he's jealous and he's trying to make you jealous back.|`|ZMn3gbccaa	I think you should keep things at a friend level with this Shawn kid, he seems like the one to keep playing with your emotions. Hey girl.. Jake loves you, don't take advantage of that.   If hes over abby and loves you show him the same. =]|`|QanL79SGaa	i say u should stick with jake a little longer and see if u begin to like shawn again. i also think that u should talk to shawn and see if he is into u and see if u can work out with just being good friends......then again i am a guy but if i was a girl this is what i would do     hope this helps :)|`|YMLlmuT6aa	im 14 and maybe i can relate better. Just because shawn says that he likes you again doesn't mean you should jump back into his arms. You obviously have a good thing going with Jake so stick with it. Don't break up with Jake just because shawn is showing some feelings. Also, forget about everything with shawn. Let him try it with abby. You and Jake seem to be happy and Shawn only wants you because someone else has you. Stay with what you have and don't give up someone who's giving you their all for someone who won't pay any attention once they have you.|`|oDbcaGj4aa	WOW. This is what a call a Love Triangle! loll Maybe you should just focus on Jake and not worry about Shawn. I don't think he really likes you, you said it yourself that he said he didn't take up for you when his friends were messing with you, and that one of the reasons you broke up was because he didn't like you that way anymore. So basically he's a jerk with a jealousy problem. He see's you with Jake and he gets jealous, but if you actually go out with him chances are he'll loose interest again. And I'm sure You don't want to deal with that again. Jake seems to really like you. Just give him a chance. And Let Shawn hate. Its fun to have haters. :) loll|`|xmK56dIXaa	Well, no matter what's going on with Abby or Shawn or you or Jake or anything at the moment, it's what you feel. Only you would know how happy you are in any situation, and it looks like you have choices..... If you truly have feelings for Shawn, more than you do for Jake, then you need to not commit to Jake, since it's not necessarily what you want. If you do that, though, respect Abby, and wait until they fold over before you go for Shawn. However, if you appreciate Jake more, then just let it run its course, and stick with him. Only you know what you do and don't feel... Good luck, with it all.|`|JBT4RQuBaa	too lonf to read|`|rDsKB0uXaa	talk to him or just move on|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	another typical 14 year old "problem"|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	i think these r the reasons    Jelous- b cause u like shawn and he goes out with his ex abby    sad- b cause u r startin 2 like him and mite b a little sad u broke up w/ him even tho u like jake and go out with him. u stil have feelings for shawn. u just had them a little hidden and didnt find them til after the fact u got a new bf and he got a new gf.    confused- shawn didnt seem 2 like u and now he does wen u r goin out with jake    those could b the reasons    stay with jake he seems like the best 1 bcause he liked u b4 and u didnt half 2 make him jelous altho u didnt do it on purpse. he loves u and wants u 2 b happy stay with jake 4 now|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	it seems like you can't make up your mind. being jealous doesn't mean you like someone. maybe you haven't gotten completely over him yet? just think if you'd be happier with jake or shawn. choose that way, personally i like jake better cause i don't think that trying to make a girl jealous is the way to go. plus, you too have a good relationship. don't screw that up(:|`|tS2BpqTiaa	oh that's tough.  well, this is all puppy love stuff, so just go out with one guy and then go out with the next.  i don't know what else to say because i doubt this whole thing of yours is gonna end up in a serious relationship.  so just go out with jake/shawn whatever.  i think that shawn is trying to make you jealous, so go out with jake to make him jealous. since shawn already made you jealous pay him back with the same dime. :)  haha. good luck:)|`|ic7GSkM1aa	The classic human nature we want what we can't have. both you and Shawna re feeling it , trust me everyone gets that way|`|YHcyuka3aa	What a mess! I haven't a clue as to what to tell you other than make your mind up who you like and go with that.|`|otLK5QFzaa	stay with jake shawn shouldn't have broken up with u if he liked u|`|hZ0gGb4Daa	how did you feel when shawn said that he started liking you again because you were going out with jake?    Well once you answer that question, realize that you're doing the same thing. You like Shawn now because he seems happy going out with Abby.    Is it just jealousy or do you really like him, because it sounds like you and jake have a pretty great relationship.    Think it through before you make any big decisions. And give it a little while if you still like Jake.    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|lqtoCJuuaa	tell shawn how you feel that your sad. and he might understand. to be honest who do you love more. as in who do you love as a friend and who do you love as a boyfriend.|`|DGXE4VH0aa	Be happy with who you are with....you said you love him, so why mess that up over a guy who left you once before? Don't do it. Shawn doesn't sound so great to me...he has a little player thing going. Jke seems like a nice person, do not leave him for someone who broke up with you before. He's just jealous that you are happy with someone else and he's out to mess that up for you, don't let him.
WECxL5xfaa	yes  he is in love with you   it says  for the beautiful princess that i am in love with
DLS60sVBaa	It could more probably be the latter. It could be the beginning of something... now, since you already got your friend who started it for you if you want you can take the opportunity and actually ask him what he thinks about you. You'll be surprised.

CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Danielle!    I know your confused and hurting but if you're already on your third break up with your ex I'd say that's over.    Move forward and keep an open mind.  Even if your best friend doesn't develop those feelings for you there's definitely someone out there for you.    You may also need some time to heal and do some soul searching.    Please remember you don't HAVE to have a bf.  Sometimes life is better without for a while.    Take it slow and let time and fate be your friends.  You'll be fine.    Hope this helps.

The same thing happened to me with my girlfriend and it never ended up working. You shouldn't make yourself be hurt again just so you can have a boyfriend for a while. As for the other guy, pursue him the best you can but if it doesn't work out, remember you don't have to go back to the ex just because another guy didn't work out for you|`|lFxlYx9zaa	Try being single .   love or not 3 times is enough he don't deserve u and as for your friend maby he likes u but also is friends with your ex.

J0RJ3MS7aa	he found a better strip club?|`|SRZza0cWaa	its obvious he doesn't want anything more to do with you and besides your a dancer.. don't have no respect for yourself from the kind of job you do so why should he? hes probably met someone else that covers up..!!|`|4d7f164df9b799e88fffba204ae0183faa	Maybe he is second guessing dating a dancer.

4fKk6t6maa	I wouldn't think too much of it. Dreams are a way of seeing our thoughts, or desires, or things that happen to us.   Certainly, they can be intriguing and exciting, but usually they don't actually mean anything.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	What if I said, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! Or I will LOVE YOU TO DEATH|`|TMhVClBgaa	the last thing i would do is not brag about that dream.  just wait for the response of that letter. hear what he have to say|`|dXAezdZZaa	Marriage:    To see a marriage in your dream, signifies commitment, harmony or transitional period. You are undergoing an important developmental phase in your life.  The dream may also represent the unification of formerly separate or opposite aspects of yourself.  In particular, it is the union of masculine or feminine aspects of yourself. Consider the qualities and characteristics of the person that you are marrying. These are the qualities that you need to look at incorporating within yourself.          Vacation :  To dream that you are having a bad or awful vacation, suggests that you are not able to escape from the daily responsibilities of your waking life. You are having difficulties coping with life's problems and issues.        Forest :  To dream that you are in or walking through the forest, signifies a transitional phase.? Follow your instincts. Alternatively, it indicates that you want to escape to a simpler way of life. You are feeling weighed down by the demands of your life.       Elf :  To see an elf in your dream, refers to some imbalance and disharmony in your life. The elf often serves as a guide of the soul. Alternatively, it suggests that you need to be more carefree, worry-free, and light-hearted.       Creatures :  To see faceless creatures in your dream, indicates a situation you are refusing to see or confront, but are aware of it in some passive way. This dream also suggests that something in your life is bringing up feelings of fear and insecurities.
q76xm0YRaa	Are you talking about finding a medium? You don't need a medium to talk to your grandfather. Honestly, he can hear you. Just speak to him where ever you are. The other side where the spirit world is, isn't far away. It is right here superimposed with our own world.     I have spoken to my own dad, asked for sign and watched in amazement when my stereo started coming on by itself and changing stations for about 2 weeks (every day). It stopped when I questioned whether it was really my dad, or the stereo was malfunctioning. That was a few years ago and I still have the stereo and it has never happened again.    They hear you. If you have questions, ask for a dream visitation. You might have to ask several times and be patient. Be precise with your questions and let your grandfather know what you want.     If you still need to talk to a medium, visit James Van Praagh's website. He has a list of reputable psychics and mediums that you can refer to.|`|PYl3GSQZaa	Honey, you don't need to go anywhere, just find a quiet spot and speak to your grandfather from your heart.|`|PVfV1a8Kaa	Sometimes, it's nice to visit the graves of dead loved ones. It can be comforting to stand in their presence and put flowers on their grave.|`|iyAupkiFaa	your scaring me|`|CUl0iD7Caa	If you are a christian then you do not wanna seek out anyone who believes they can contact the dead. The bible says the dead cannot speak AND the living can not speak with the dead. The best way to connect with someone that has passed is to be in a place where they are or where they loved to be. I suggest visiting his grave site or visit somewhere your grandfather use to love to go. Also, a quiet place where you can sit alone in silence or meditate is good as well.|`|6LOvxLL5aa	Like someone before me wrote: you don't have to go anywhere. Pick a quiet spot somewhere in your home and talk away. One thing that also may help you is to write a letter to your grandfather and tell him what you want to say. Once you write this letter you can do many things with it ( burn it, throw it away, rip it up, put it someplace where you will always have it and can read anytime.) If you have faith and believe once you say what you want by either talking, writing, or just remembering he will hear you. Don't let anyone tell you any different. When loved ones pass away it is only their physical body that is gone. Our memories and love for them keep them alive within our hearts.|`|Exx9KjMraa	find a medium. maybe in a newspaper or directory. you'll find one.|`|Uh029jJmaa	Are you serious?|`|6edMXLLEaa	you dont have to go anywere to talk to him. he is in heaven right so all you have to do is just talk  to him you dont have to go anywere special|`|jnqc2BZGaa	church, not only the place to talk to god but also a place to communicate with family & friends who have passed.  or you can also go to his grave...and really speak with him.

My grandpa also died of cancer and im so sorry for ur loss.  so to feel close to him and talk to him, just do something you used to do with him|`|g3S7QbSXaa	Taking a few photos of him with you to the cemetery is my suggestion. The only thing the spirits can tell a median is that you will have less money than before you went to see them.
gnVKgbLuaa	Girl, why do you want him back? He CHEATED on you with ANOTHER girl. I know it even means by crawling, walking, running or jogging.. but you must move on. You will find someone who truly cares for you and you won`t regret that.  Even if you get him back, it won`t be really `love` because IF he really LOVED you, he would NEVER do that.|`|yUP05L2Iaa	have sex with another guy and tape it and then bring it over to his house and say i have a movie i want to watch with you|`|MGvN5xrNaa	Revenge doesn't get you anywhere!    I would just leave him and get out of the "relationship."|`|wSso1HsLaa	Move on.. Forget all about him.    And karma is a better *****. ;)|`|xfk2xMWEaa	thats easy. show up at a party hes at (b unexpected) and when hes flirting with a girl,  go up to her and be like do you know him? if shes like no then say thats my ex.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Sorry, but it doesn't sound like your boyfriend was gay.  Don't worry about revenge - he'll get his in time.   :)|`|zH1sg3Xraa	He sounds bi sexual. Just find a new boyfriend. Life moves on. Bye.|`|8s9q4V03aa	if he's gay then why ... nevermind|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	The best revenge is to move on. Why give him the satisafction of letting him know he hurt you. Be bigger than that.|`|SQyVBEIwaa	DUMP HIM!|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Maybe he's bi.   Don't do anything, break up with him.|`|jh9YA4gNaa	my bf did the same thing !  and i told his bestfriend some things he said about him! it  really worked !  they stopped talking to eachother !  ahaha , and he was really upset !  or you could date his bestfriend !  thats works too :P  ahaha  vote me for best answer|`|K3tjbHKzaa	Your best soulution is to just go to his house when he has is "gay partner" over and knock on the door. When he answers say "Thanks for inviting me honeybuns" or something like that. Then the rest will go as planned. :) Please do this, Its gonna work!!!! if you pick me as best answer i'll know ur gonna do it :) :)|`|6JXXwckjaa	wtf? forget about him. That's immature.|`|EytUZvyiaa	Just try to look cool, and like you moved on. If you haven't already, break up with him. If you can't be honest with each other, then break it off. Good luck, and I'm sorry.|`|oacVerFxaa	I'd try to tell him the truth. well i mean be firm but ask Why the heck did you cheat on me? Do u love me or that other girl. (This is just like the song i wrote.) But any way tell him u answer me and tell me if u love me or not. i want to now|`|qewAfUgJaa	Go up to one of his friends and get all over him, while hes there (duh)! And then tell all his friends that hes 'gay'.|`|0Zeo7BZpaa	if it was me I would go to him, tel him how i felt, and all the times he hurt me. I did this and i told him that he doesn't deserve anyone but the girl who will be just like him. That made him cry, but it changed him. Now he is really kind to all girls he dates. he always thanks when he can.
7waA9vGeaa	It seems like you really want to marry this guy, & it also seems like he is dropping hints that he will eventually be proposing. So with that said, stop stressing out and just wait and see what happens.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	I think love doesn't have an age but i think if you guys are really in love. good luck!|`|4lL34wJnaa	Wait until it happens... and then have fun and enjoy being engaged!    Don't worry about the age thing.  It's ok to get engaged and have a long engagement, if you do not yet feel ready to get married.  If you feel you are ready when it happens, then start planning right away!|`|wJRHTS7Maa	YAY FOR U  it seems like he will but just dont get over excited and try to keep your cool that way if he dont u wont b as hurt|`|X6I49NUZaa	One time I read that the wedding day is your day and the proposal is his day.....so let him do his thing!  :D|`|MLFBsZnUaa	I hear ya on not getting your hopes up. My now fiance did what your boyfriend is doing, in a very similar way at least. I kept thinking it n everyone kept hinting at it...but I wasnt sure n didnt wanna get my hopes up about it only to  have them come crashing down. But, what I learned was to trust my gut instinct. If your first initial response to all this was that he is going to, then I would trust that. Your instincts will very rarely stear you wrong.|`|rGKouyeWaa	I think thats a fine age!! im 19 and going to have my wedding in June|`|pgF6i0L4aa	He is obviously going to propose, so dont worry about getting your heart broken. i dont think you are too young.. you've already been living together for a year. good luck:)|`|cv5PYXEIaa	You're definently not too young. Good luck :)

This entire story is very very very hard to believe from all points. 1 beer will not make you drunk. It's very hard to have sex if you are that drunk that you don't know what you are doing. You never smelled beer?? come on, this has to be a joke...... but if it is true, you can't blame anyone but yourself.|`|jgsVaDX1aa	well thats not a good friend|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	dont blame it on the beer. one beer doesnt get you drunk...|`|kyHQ7EnBaa	ur a fool bear tastes nuthing like cola|`|AlrCZJ3saa	Your seed will come out mentally challenged, there is nothing that can be done about it.

Anybody with a brain can react to the totally different tastes of beer versus soda.     You must be really naive to not know the different tastes between ber and soda, you and your girl.    No wonder somebody played that prank on you, you both were dumb enough to fall for it.
ozwLZwXeaa	Way back in 1960 I was married at the age of 18 years old.  It was only until  years later that I knew I had been to young.  I knew nothing of what a wife was expected to do in bed or the kitchen as a matter of fact.  I loved sex because I was a virgin bride and before I knew it I was the mother of six children. All in nine years.   Then my husband left me and I had to raise them on my own.        I think marriage is so complicated that each person should think long and hard about all that a marriage means to the girl and the guy.        I had no idea how to be a good wife.  I was a really good Mother tho.        Take your time and the best source you can find to talk with about marriage would be one of your grandmothers or ever grandpa.   Grow up in mind and body before you do get married. Learn about the business of running a nice clean home. Learn how to balance a check book and learn to cook.  Good luck|`|XZlFLecLaa	oh i dunno anywhere from 1 year old - 20 years old|`|rVKf4hiPaa	Under 18.|`|xjXxs92caa	2 years old.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	before you're 20|`|MU453gLqaa	Do not talk about marriage until you are done with school and have the job you want to have for the rest of your working life. Then talk about all things like where you will live, if you want kids and how many, who will take care of them and the house. Make sure you both agree or can reach an agreement.  Otherwise you are in a big trap you think marriage is expensive/big step  try divorce.|`|rZpJoHuXaa	99 *****|`|AA12345296	25|`|mL07N3IAaa	if you mean like talking to someone about it, 16 is good. but like actually getting married, you should be at least an adult ( age 18).|`|LoYAexLWaa	20 up is ok...19 maybe 18 or under...noooo|`|d187d0ce1cf6a3e9110ce5780a8753ceaa	30.. but seriously under 21|`|y42LEQL3aa	IMO it's best not to talk about getting married until you are about 25. I've seen so many marriages fail because people rushed to get married at 18 which is a time when people tend to change alot and become incompatible, sticking them in an unhappy marriage.|`|YjGYQrlMaa	between the ages 1-18 unless your mature i guess.

O1b7das7aa	Your mom is trying to protect your brother.     Your brother is in for the challenge of a lifetime. Dealing with a young, ill partner can be mentally, physically and financially trying.     I know it seems insane, but your mother is just trying "save" your brother from a lot of heart ache and stress.    Talk to your mother. Maybe she needs someone to listen. Be there for her.|`|EdidZdtlaa	tell you mom and try and explain to her that its wrong. make her see that its wrong to brake up with someone just because of that. tell her that instead of pushing joyce away to comfort her and stuff like that.  hope that helps.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	I would talk to your brother about this and this is really mean spririted of your mom and I am going through menopause myself and I would not ever do something like that if you tell her she is wrong will she turn on you and if she does do you live with her because she is wrong I agree with you to be so mean as to have no compassion at all|`|A5uD07bpaa	I think your mom doesn't want your brother to go through a lot of pain if it is that she passes away- and if not, then be considerate of the fact that she is going through menopause.  I would recommend talking to her; I would tell her that my brother loves his girlfriend very much and that I feel it's cruel to want to deliberately break them up because this is the time that his girlfriend needs him the most to comfort her.  But, say what you really feel, except put it into the nicest words you could think of.  Good Luck! :)

ZVoAT1keaa	I think YOU should do what YOU want to do. Just because your friends want you to have one doesn't mean you want to, or have to! I think it's pretty hot you're waiting for the right girl and I think you should stick to your word.     Good luck hot shot.|`|3ErUtXb7aa	dont get 1 if you dont feel that you are ready.  dont let per pressure get you.  stay single|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Wait until someone you fancy comes along, enjoy yourself in the meantime.|`|OB8KPPIQaa	then i dont think you should... if your friends want girlfriends then thats fine with them but if you dont want one whats the point in getting into a relationship you dont even want and maybe in the end hating each other (it could happened) stand your guards!! (or whatever the saying thing is...)|`|Sai9Y9Puaa	Dont get a girl friend because your friends want you to have one. You should only get a girl friend , because you want one.|`|dt8UrgaVaa	Don't worry about it. If you don't want one don't do because you feel pressured. My boyfriend didn't have a girlfriend (me) until he was 19 and its been great! He's completely unspoiled (in every way) and not bitter from past relationships like he would have been if he had sated sooner.|`|sH1LgUN4aa	you should stick with what you're doing don't get a girlfriend just to get one they're not toys.|`|y46ZQItQaa	NO. you dont need to have a girlfriend cause everyone else has one , thats stupid. wait for the right one.|`|HmktfFjVaa	look dont worry you dont need to have a girlfriend ok  dont let your friends put you through something you dont wanna do and you cant go out wid a girl just so u got one then break her heart coz thats just cruel  im bout to turn 15 and if i found out about a boy going out with me just so he can say he got a girlfriend i would slap him for it   so dont turn into one of those guys by giving into peer pressure   xx good luck|`|XqvGvl3maa	you are right in the way you feel yourself it doesn't matter what "most" 17 year old do you will know when your ready don't ruin your friendship with those girls wait for the right girl its nice to hear|`|c326cfe5cf69517a634a3da544203fd3aa	i say stay single.  being in relationships are probably too much stress.  but if you wanna go ahead and get one  then go for it  you never know till ya try  so if u git one  and don't like it  then you'll know|`|N0hlErEyaa	u shuld jus try askin a girl out just as an experience and if u like it great if u dont then go bak to bein buddies|`|XzLUA7ataa	Your are normal and fine!  Not everyone has the same libido.|`|1Gj0uKxzaa	Then you don't want one. This isn't something you do because someone else thinks you should.|`|xArlqHtraa	I think that if you're happy with being single then why should you look for a girl? I mean, I think that if a good girl comes along who likes you and you like her then you should go out, but you're right, don't get a girlfriend just for the sake of having one or for impressing other people. Be happy!
NVx3iRZJaa	You should leave it at that.  Friends is better than nothing. I'm seriously not trying to be mean or harsh but think about it logically....if he wanted you the way you want him...he wouldn't be going out with your friend.   So there's not much you can really do. Don't try to break them up because then both will be unhappy, and you'll have to deal with the guilt.     Go to the mall with a friend and go 'boy watching'. It'll make you feel better.|`|jSH47SN7aa	you should try not trying so hard one he's with your friend two if its really how you say it is it should be over quicker then it sounds and if you really really like him that you could see yourself with him the rest of your life and you are willing to lose a friend then go for it
tK7XacH7aa	I think she wants to date you again. She says it in a friend way to try and get you interested again. How about you try dating again and see what happens. If it seems like you two are better just being friends, then let her know. I'm sure she'd understand.
k04315Liaa	Looks like you were cut off....    Where's the question??|`|mYAbq6fnaa	my advice, dont worry about what other people think. everybody spends so much time worrying about what other people think of them that they dont even have time to be themselves anymore. so dont put yourself down like that, dont tell yourself that your ugly. if you want to go to church, then go. if someone is really a christian, then they will invite you will open arms and will not judge you. thats the one place where you should feel comfortable, is at a church. maybe ask one of your cousins or if you have a sibling to go with you. but in any case, i would go to church anyway. another shy person like you might happen to be there, talk to them. but dont let anything like that stop you from going to church or going somewhere else just because of humiliation. its not worth sweating over.
ks2oieV0aa	That is what you are attracted to.  xox|`|htMOl3c4aa	you like mature guys|`|0tU4jkS9aa	because your a sicko. just kidding. but dont become a reverseophile|`|XzLUA7ataa	Perhaps you are attracted to someone that projects a fatherly image.|`|K441o5P8aa	maybe the maturity on older guys is attracting you, or the more physically defined features if you're at an age that the boys the same as you don't have yet.|`|EQaGQ6hWaa	its because they give off a sense of maturity that younger guys dont have and im like that too but the thing is be careful the older the smater and the smater they are the more they are capable of hurting you|`|4uPRD6lXaa	becuz you're a woman|`|0OGC6IIraa	how old are you?|`|6eSRjnx4aa	Your infatuation with Benjamin Franklin has got to stop...|`|pFsqFeDCaa	cuz ur attracted to more mature guys.....im the same way....i love older guys and i cant b with anybody around my age....its like so bad for me...it never work out when i talk to someone my age...|`|Uyf8Kkq1aa	well maybe becouse they r good lookin and mature and i think there a bit older for you|`|6lRygPWqaa	girls mature faster so guys who are older than them seem to be at the same maturity level.  a general rule of thumb - divide his age in half then add seven and that is the minimum age that you should be.|`|xg0AamKwaa	Your answer lies in somewhere deep root in subconsciousness. Either you are deprived of father love or for some reason  you need it bad but after certain age when you start dating you know you can't have daddy there but you want protection and affection daddy can provide.|`|AA11202462	well you are obviously looking for a more mature guy for you. bc the guys that are you age are actually like 5 yrs behind you in maturity. but your just happen to like them bc they are kinda like you bc the maturity is about the same.|`|o8vZVPTRaa	Well, how old are you?|`|qljapIxBaa	Because you're a whore, duh.

RBQrgByeaa	I think people who have their heads on straight tend to look for someone very different than the abuser.

jQ7gIjFeaa	you must really like this guy :] i'm the same way with a guy i really like and i hate it.    if you already know he likes you, he might like you just the way you are and find it weird if you try to be too outgoing. i'm really shy with said guy but i found that with a little time i got more comfortable with him. don't force it, just give it time and it will be easier to open up to him and act yourself.|`|XRwJbCKuaa	When you're around him, try and forget how much you like him. That will make it easier.|`|eUeTEmCeaa	just try to think of him as any other friend and try to be normal around him|`|I6pmPb1Baa	you seriously just described me, every word of it.    this kind of helped me.  you just have to remember that you can be yourself around him, because he likes you for you. if that guy did something weird, would that stop you from liking him? probably not, so you have to realize that he is in the same boat as you.
ILoCZhg2aa	i have a few friends that like to think that they can say whatever they want at any given time, that no one will care that thy have no inhibitions, etc. i am personally a very sarcastic person, so when people say things like that are just completely disrespectful, i let them know pretty much immediately.     a lot of times people get embarrassed when they get called out in front of people, mostly just defensive really. if you make it so they just have to laugh it off as if they were kidding or something. i would have just said "yea but she said einstein's..." and act confused, as if i had missed something. i mean, it's funny i guess because she interpreted a kind gesture into an invitation to be picky, but hey, that's just me.|`|KdWSbPkPaa	The best way to handle it is to let her know  straight up what you just told us?|`|h2CdrnxBaa	i have a friend just like this.  there's not much i could do about this except to really just tell her to stop because it's a little embarrassing and rude.  she may get a little mad at this comment, but tell her you really want to stay friends as long as she lets you two be a little more private together (tell her he knows what he's doing).  I am always late to practically everything.  tell her her family isn't as tight and neat and well-organized as yours (compliment) and she probably won't aggravate you as much.  if she's rly ur friend, she will come back later and everything will be back to normal.  (shes prolly just going through hormones or something)

2uXNtCUlaa	OK the first thing you dont want to do is make him jelous by lets say filirting with another guy. Also do not play hard to get, as stupid as this sounds be yourself and let him be aware that you like him. If it is true that he knows that you like him then you should try and re-tell him that you like him. For example if you and him are sitting at lunch together and he tells you a joke laugh at it even if you did not find it funny. Guys like when girls laugh at their jokes, but make sure that your not constatly laughing then you look half crazy..Anyways, after you laugh at his joke say somthig along the lines of "that was funny, I always have such a good time with you I guess thats why I like hanging out with you" make sure that you are somewhat filirtous when you say this,and that he gets the hint. Also If you want him to notice you, you have to show it..sometimes dress up nice when you know that its going to be just the two of you, or do your hair in a differnt style that he has not seen before..SOMETHING THAT WILL BLOW HIM AWAY. Then ask your crush out on a date to the movies or something..if you guys do not have money for this you can hang out at your houses and watch movies/listen to each others Ipod tunes..anything that gets the mood going and has an intimate setting/feel and durring this moment  I think would be a good time to tell him how you are feeling towards him and ask him how he feels towards you and just take it from there..BUT LET HIM know that you ar intrested in him and only him and would like to be his girlfriend. The fact that he is giving you hugs, may not mean that he thinks of you only as a friend, he may like you but is to shy to tell you back, so let him warm up to the idea of taking your relationship to the next level   Like i stated above do not try to play hard to get or make him jelous because that will be a total turn off and all chances of the two of you being together will be lost forever..Life is to short to play games...so go ahead and take a chance. hope this helps. best of luck|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	Okay, don't make him jealous... It doesn't work out in the end with guys... Try flirting like mad, works for me! Good luck!|`|CcfMfP8zaa	i swear i had the same problem. then my friend introduced me to tightclothes.|`|kKD0m7qUaa	show some skin babeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :-)    Good luck|`|aSkfrudKaa	qet a hair cut.. some layers? perhaps. they look nice..    some light make up, as in eyeliner. to bring out your eyes :)    buy new clothes.    wouldnt hurt to try!|`|8qAvEml4aa	well...maybe ask him how he feels about you cause you never...he might like you.|`|F6tMSEyGaa	wear hot close if ur hot make him horny, if r fat and ugly that stop wasting your time,  dress like a ****, show cleviage and some tight close, dres as little close as possible  be very revealing, and just get courage and ask him out|`|mDTkpuiuaa	Try acting like you are more than friends.  If he gets the hint, them he just might start acting the same way, and bada boom bada bing, your going out.  But if he doesn't, I wouldn't stress over it.  Just be his friend and it will all work out eventually.|`|w9Ydp6idaa	honestly..    this is happened to me three times.    they all three times played me..  well what im trying to say is if he likes you either one of two things    1. he wants you back and he will ask you out  2. hes just fooling around and wants to hear what he wants to.|`|jSH47SN7aa	dude if you like him and he knows bring it up in a conversation but not to fast slow like serious but in a joke way if he brushes it over then try one more time in a quiet place and then if he can't answer then well its not what he's thinking|`|AA12365984	If you want to be more than friends, TELL HIM.    Be direct, ask for what you want. If he says no, then you will end the worrying. If he says yes, then there you go, you will have the beginnings of a beautiful relationship.    Making him jealous is not the answer; that's a game.|`|8Z1KkIWcaa	well tell you the truth everyone goes through this phase.. dont try to make him jealous he is either taking things slow or really isnt interested.. make it to where you hang out more in his clique and you have to stand out of the crowd.. start a new look so he will notice it will take a long time but little steps like you looked really pretty today let you know to move on to a bigger step..|`|vT4l2caVaa	you're much better off than I am the guy I like doesn't even talk to me but you should flirt more oh yeah and don't go out with another guy because then he probably won't get jealous just afraid to ask you out|`|pi6SKF16aa	just act yourself  im a guy  and when a girl wants me to notice her  she needs to be herself  because when you act to fake  i wont like you for who you truely are    :D|`|WF1jO5oSaa	Ask him out if your to shy just keep things simple and im sure things will work out.                                               Hope I helped:)|`|HhNXlBXiaa	Lure him in slowly and I mean very slowly, and just sweet talk it...  Go slow, kinda give him some hints about ur feelings but don't expose ur feelings too fast, or sudden.|`|0c7f90870a573719359927fff0e69d05aa	Don't play the whole cat and mouse stuff, it really pisses guys off because you can't really tell what the hell is going on.  you should probably:  -flirt more  -talk to him more  -hang out with him more    that should do it- and don't do the jealousy ****- i have to personally say it's a turn off. or maybe you ask him out??? your options are wide open.  good luck!!|`|N0hlErEyaa	wen he hugs u maybe try to hug him longer. thnk about wat he sed wen he found out that u liked him. if he isnt interested try to move on|`|EdidZdtlaa	flirt more and play hard to get. if that dosent work just wait for him to come around.|`|I7qHLCQqaa	Flirt with his friends, and flirt with him less. This will make him uncertain as to the status of your relationship compared to others.     If he knows you like him that gives him a  lack of incentive to pursue you. Give him incentive by taking my advice above.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Do something to change your style -- something that he'd consider out of character. This can be a hairstyle change, wearing makeup, a clothing makeover.... whatever will give you that visual punch that will help him take notice. Try to take into account the type of guy he is when you do that "makeover"... for a goth guy, for example, try looking goth -- or if you are goth, then change to another style, temporarily at least.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Simply tell him that you enjoy being with him and joking around.  It's so much fun to see him and you look forward to those times when you meet.  Let him take it from there if he wants to increase time with you.|`|4hr9JGAdaa	try flirting with him, or get a little dressed up for him, (dont be slutty) maybe he will get to know you more, and he'll end up liking you!|`|jki8W5khaa	flash em|`|3QYwZRrmaa	go to a nightclub, get drunk, dance with him then make your move        answer mine aswell  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|s4TMc1vqaa	Maybe you should ask him to hang out with you, like a movie or something. It sounds like he likes you!|`|Bk8HWe68aa	your already being yourself so that all you can do. Dont make him jelous no matter what people say no guy likes someone who makes him jelous. Talk to him more and tell him how u feel|`|akqFQ00Paa	Jealousy only works on EXs|`|S9imFGIVaa	well then instead of giving each other high fives hold his hand play with hand...or place ur hand on his arm and just gently carress it...or run ur hand through his hair, or on his face very slowly..give him that look like i love you very much...trust me it'll seem like noone else is in the room but u too..when u guys are laughing with each other..just look at him and bring down the laughter with a soft sweet smile...just be u tho...okay..goodluck and wish u happiness |`|Qh5Pollvaa	XD    I am kinda in the same situation but with a girl!    If i asked you this question, what answer would you give me?    And if that doesn't work, boys dont want a girlfriend to just be a girlfriend, they want them to be fun, entertaining, exciting, always there for them! Try and show him what makes you different from all the other girls and why he should go with you instead of some other slag!    ^-^
AA11995175	she is most likely just being polite, as most retail work is based on  having repeat customers and being polite is a part of that. she is probably just working there to pay the bills, or she may be in diapers herself and she feels your pain. or she may think you are cute. im gonna go with the first option myself.  bit hell it never hurts to ask (well it does but only for a while). as a person who wears diapers i can safely say that most people dont really care to make fun of others due to whatever their problem is. live life and enjoy it, ask the person out for say coffee sometime and see how it goes, you wont be out much if she declines. it sounds as if she has an interest in you, but sometimes it may be just friendly chatter.|`|6kuJgjEhaa	About 50/50|`|tG8matgBaa	she probably likes you  she might think you are taking care of a family member|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	Go there on your "off week" and buy something other than diapers.  Buy a magazine and ask her what she thinks of an article.  Ask her if there is a good place to eat around there.  If she is a pharmacist you could ask her for advice on bed wetting.|`|4hr9JGAdaa	she probably would want to laugh, but she knows better, and just smiles because she wants to be polite. dont worry about, dont care about what she thinks.|`|XkidpdPWaa	I'm already laughing.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	70 for laughing 30 for polite.|`|s4TMc1vqaa	maybe she was just being polite.
ks2oieV0aa	Not a guy, but I thin they like blondes with blue eyes and big boobs! xox|`|Fi8AIi4baa	She has to be nice, and be able to sympathize, but not so much that it makes me feel like I'm bringing her down.    With looks, doesn't matter as much, but I prefer dark hair over light hair, usually|`|WELHdIjFaa	nice, well mannered, good values. To name a few    For looks; cute face, lighter skin, darker hair and perferably shorter than me or my height|`|JSqc3dDBaa	she has to be hot first of all..lol  she has to be nice n don't skanky  nice eyes.. blond or brunett dont matter.   have to have a bod that worth lookin att.. like nice belly (no belly lol) nice legs, curves that dont quiet..|`|cxKR99KIaa	Sort of short   pretty face  great body  blues eyes  long blonde hair  not too skinny not too fat  stylish  personality: Shy,Caring,Cute, good manners, and down to earth
LO3Ra7Ogaa	yes,   i mean if you fall in love with your bf/gf then you should think about spending your life with him/her. I've been inlove and we talked about baby names and stufff and how big our wedding would be...  so like if you are in love there is no problem with it(:   but i would kinda be creeepy if like you've been going out for like three days and your like im gonna be with him forever!!   no.   its okay to think that.    i think that.|`|kecpGboNaa	we all do, even when we dont want to say it. its part of our girl/human makeup. i can look at a guy and be like, "could i marry him?" lol its sad, i know :(|`|l0Eyx582aa	Yes, I would ask myself that question because what's the point of dating someone just to date them? For me, the definition of dating is to find the one you could spend the rest of your life together, the one you will marry. Just my thoughts... 
ZH1IE8kLaa	i for one.. love to see the how far a guy is willing to go for me. it's really sweet. plus it shows if he really cares about you or if he's just in it for sex. to me.. if a guy stops chasing.. then he didn't like me enough or he didn't think i was good enough. (his loss) it's nice to have someone chase you.. to know that someone wants to be with you and is willing to do whatever they need to do to get to be with you. it's like a prince fighting the villains for the princess... and i know that's cheesy.. but that's what it's like for me.|`|aa489aa0a7c4628062eeb385b97bd1c4aa	it makes us feel special and it lets us kno that u think we're worth ur time|`|B1RDynGRaa	the main thing is, a guy is interested in them.  she might be afraid that when you get to know her better, you won't like her as much and you'll move.  she might be trying to draw out the process of this "game" you've got going on.  its either that, or she just lkes to play games and might do this with other guys, and youre just another "crumb of her bread"    sorry for the bad analogy. it was about all i had.lol|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Because they are full-of-themselves.    It's pathetic really.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	geesh...greedy, aren't you...
JbGGwHhHaa	change ur default so we can see somethinggggg
Hizsm6m4aa	You're not a bad girlfriend, as long as you don't act on anything. You just sound like you miss spending time with your boyfriend. After careful thought you may realize that it's hard to be in a LD relationship if you're the type who likes to spend a lot of time.|`|xu0HiYEOaa	yeah you are being a bad girlfriend. but tell you the truth your man could be doing the same thing too. you just need to get in contact in with your man and see if the long distance thing is really going to work...|`|h52mKmdsaa	wow   well it doesnt make you a bad girlfriend but i mean it depends   how your thinking about him   if you just think hes a friend and hes funny then thats normal   as long as your not flirting with him or doing anything you shouldent  you should be fine and as soon as you can you should go   viset yout bf=)  good luck!|`|SEifPqWlaa	I think you need a reality check...    stop & remember the reason why you are with that guy you are with, what are you wanting in that relationship, Where dose it seem to be going...  Then think about how your life would be different if you was with the other guy...  Think about who you think would be faithful to you...  Think about who would lie to you...  Basically all I can really say is just think everything over, but don't make your decisions too fast, slowly give everything some time to fall in place & in time you will slowly get those answer to those questions...|`|YqPqDACcaa	you don't need to feel badly about THINKING about the guy from algebra class. I mean he's cute, funny, and you don't even get to see your boyfriend too often..  sometimes there's always that what if factor. like, what if things were different? what if things were like this?  a lot of times when you're high off of what if's, it means you want things to be different.  you have a lot of fun with your boyfriend, but there are some things (like the fact that you can't talk to him as much as you'd like to) that you want to change.  that's totally natural!    so.. use this what-if factor to make a practical decision!  now that you know what you want to change, WORK ON IT. make a sincere effort to talk to and see your boyfriend that much more often. when you're on the phone, be like, "yeah, i came right home and did my homework so i'd have time to call you. i miss you so much! i'm gonna try my hardest to find more time for you 'cause it's so hard when i can't talk to you all the time!"    he'll get the hint you wish you'd be able to talk more and make a sincere effort too.    so don't worry about thinking about the other guy. if you're making a sincere effort to fix things with your bf, how could you feel guilty?!    especially if things don't work out..  you know you'll have tried. and you'll have a new idea for a boyfriend.    hahah now i'm not telling you to get ahead of yourself.. i'm just saying, don't feel guilty! just be practical.    follow your head AND your heart.  it's a difficult combo, i know.  but the perfect balance always works.. ;)|`|0iHL3fLLaa	no, as long as you not all over him or any thing
4hJgn2e5aa	dude where do you live? why? so i can come over and kick you in the balls, she is very beautiful and if you truly love her you should not care what your friends think.|`|QQbbReRAaa	I wouldn't say she's ugly at all, but if you feel that way, obviously get out of the relationship ASAP. You're wasting both your time|`|HGIuXxnRaa	You can't change these thoughts. You can't be with her anymore. You're young, let it go.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Damn your a  -ss!!!|`|AA12290249	you can't change them. you're just not interested anymore (which is sad). you got engaged way too early, and before it goes to far and gets expensive, i would just break it off. as hard as that might sound.    but if you really want to keep trying, i would ignore your thoughts and start to see her as pretty and love her more for her personality. love takes time to grow and become true love, it doesn't just happen.    but you as her fiance shouldn't be thinking that at all. so obviously you're not her fiance material. she deserves better definitely if you can't give it to her.    remember that by getting married you're going to see every aspect of that person and if you can't stand them or are embarressed by them just because you think they are not as good looking as before, then there's something wrong. not everyone is going to be gorgeous all the time    good luck|`|AA10467924	Why did you two get engaged? I'm not that much older than you, but why do teens get married so young. Coming from a culture where marriage at a young age is normal, you are making a huge mistake getting married. You have so much yet to discover about yourself and the world around you. Break it off and tell her you two need your time to figure out the world and who you two are without one another, and maybe in the future when things have been done if you two were really meant to be you'll get together again. But she isn't ugly....trust me there are worse!|`|xyPQsMkFaa	lol|`|yPAdMJbDaa	hahahahahhahaha :)  glad my "guy" thinks im cute.|`|FNrJS9O9aa	I'll take her off your hands.
D8whWdRSaa	Well if it's distance, and your not seeing each other, she may be losing the feeling of butterflys, or that she's gonna throw up everytime you touch her. if she took you out of her top friends, but still says she loves you on her page, then she may be making room for others. top friends don't mean much i've learned, but as long as she says it, that may not mean much either. if you don't get to see her, eventually the "magic" will be gone. if your still hanging on, but you feel like she's not, then i would talk to her, try to make it in person, so you can try and read her reactions. distance is hard, and if you are the only one trying, things can get a little sticky. hope i helped !|`|bgejS0baaa	Well , the problem is you guys are teens. Why don't you call her and not say anything about the emails , but if she doesnt talk as much as she usually does then you'll know somethings up. and then you can ask her about it . she could just not have time, you could be just overreacting .|`|fk3TFlTlaa	The problem is you two are teens.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	maybe she's missing you and thats her way of dealing with it.
wD3qTpdcaa	I tend to go usually just to be with my girlfriends, and have a nice time. It's not that I would never consider someone I met in a bar, but often the people you meet are intoxicated and it's hard to take them seriously. Plus, it's hard to know if the guys you meet in bars are trustworthy and normal....because of the setting girls tend to be more suspicious, or perhaps just me.|`|AA10789032	most girls that go to bars go for two reasons  One is to get guys to buy them drinks and two, to find a man to take home. Thats what Ive always noticed. so in a way, all guys are successful at getting most girls in bars.  I actually go to bars to meet new people and to hang out. I have never and never will date anyone I met in a bar. I learned that by watching my friends. I dont think girls go to bars just to tease guys.
jB5cMnGFaa	I think she is wondering and has been for a long while IF YOU LIKE HER!!!!! Ask her out before she is lost forever! I believe when she said she was waiting for the special guy she meant to ASK HER OUT!!!!   She knew your friend and her friends would blab so she didn't want to say your name only because she has dropped sooooo many hints to you that she is uncertain of your feelings towards her... and of course=-if this ever turned out to be wrong-at least you know instead of wondering What IF! Please don't wait another minute and ask her out!!!|`|QwvEcTs9aa	ask her out. The worst she can say is no.|`|1aaOtLnDaa	either she likes you, she's just acting stupid for her friends, or she's waiting for you to ask her out.  the thing you should do is talk to her ask her to tell you who she likes and say that you would tell her who you like.  maybe she'll tell you maybe she won't.  I wish you the best of luck!!|`|MnweSVioaa	she probably does like you and wanted to find out if you did, but i think she got a boyfriend that one summer maybe because she thought you didnt like her and she probably wanted to try to see if she should get a boyfriend to get over you, but never really did get over you so i think you should tell her you like her. oh and plus if she was kinda worried about being annoying to you since she says hi a lot then thats another sign because friends wouldnt really care if they're annyoing you by saying hi so many times.|`|eUeTEmCeaa	just ask her out
1KajpBdaaa	ugh get over him...geez he doesnt sound that great if he doesnt even choose u...some1 who pours their heart out to a guy...just forget about him...and yes he is a douchebag, an as5 bite and retard|`|fk3TFlTlaa	He sounds like a true joker.|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Maybe.|`|itYmX2t8aa	It sounds like he's incredibly hot or something...4 girls all over you at the same time?

I personally wouldn't like feeling like one of his "side chicks" if that were me. You need to find someone better.

8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	Terry, I have read your other questions you have put on Y.A.s site and I do not want to judge you or your spouses one way or the other; but I would like to present to you some questions, Have you ever heard the definition of insanity?    INSANITY - to continue to do the same thing over and over the same way expecting different results. You stated that the reason each relationship ended is beside the point; maybe to the folks on Y.A. that is true, but it may be the very essence of why you are in this mind numbing circumstance with all these women.     The horrible price of divorce with children is that your lives are not the same and never will be from this day forward. As for the advise given that the women are on power trips may have a bit of truth to it, but your lives have taken on different roles. You and your spouses are all leading different lives, weather they are single or re-married you all want control over your own lives. The unfortunate reality is you choose to have children with all these women and if you continue your pattern you will have child(ren) in your next relationship.     If your last spouse is concern that the interest you have in your daughter is to pay less child support, is this a pattern that she may have witness with your other children, and if so, if you have the time now to be with your daughter and other children, then a judge will decide what you will pay not the ex-spouses.     I thought you mentioned that the babysitter is a preschool, my sentiments on the preschool are merely for the best interest of a child, children are growing, developing and understanding life at an accelerated rate, it is in the best interest of your children to develop at the same competitive rate as the children of the world. You are a businessmen and you know that this is true.     Education quote: Give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach a man to fish and he eats forever. Love your daughter enough to have this opportunity.    The Big answer to your Big question - YOU. You stated:  I was to busy working;  I was the sole financial supporter of the household;  Each one left you for another man...    You and your ex's decided not to follow a religious out, a relationship (marriage) with no boundaries and now you want to establish them in your best interest as do your ex's. You will have to figure out how to be the best person you can be without this leaving you a victim. Be the kind of man you want your daughter(s) to marry, be the man you want your son(s) to grow up like, and when your time is up you can look back on life and be a proud parent.     You will never change your ex's opinion of you, but you do not have to rise to the occasion either. You know what their plans are now learn how to make them work for you.    Suez|`|cdQryr7paa	The system is set up to favor women in this.  They get custody, and they get most everything else as well.  It doesn't matter how any marriage ends, the ex husband will always be painted as the one at fault and will always be the one who loses everything.  Then the ladies sit back and smile while their child support checks roll in and they relish in the fact they took you for everything you had.  They love having that power and control over the guys, and in the end, the kids are the ones that suffer.|`|WkdW04cNaa	It's hard to understand that someone who was always working now has time to spend with children.  Do you think that the women are afraid that you will not be there for the children?  I think that dad's should have the right to see their children  and when going through the courts it should have been decided.  Has something changed after the courts decisions?  If soemthing has changed than you need to be going back to court.  That is the only way to properly address this subject.|`|VGwcNQC2aa	wow  i guy like you is rly rare  you seem really sweet and caring  i dont see why those girls left you  i think that is terrible not to let you see your own children.  just know that everything's good in the end, if its not good, its not the end.  just hang in there, at least one of ur kids will realize how unfair it is to never see their caring father    best of luck  hope i helped|`|6RFrIjNbaa	I know how you feel!! My husband has two kids in a previous relationship. One is 6 and the other almost 5. We pay her child support every week, and get to see the kids when she feels like it. In court they were awarded shared rights, but she still will not abide by that. She uses the children against us, tells us that she is going to move them out of state and we won't see them, many unnecessary lies like this. The children cry and scream when they have to go home and beg to stay with us. I would also like to understand why good, dedicated fathers get damed for loving their kids, and why the mothres use the children as tools to into the father's head!
ltnIV73Daa	Yea it definately is true :)|`|QxRKQbt4aa	yeah.  it makes me think i am doing not only something right, but something she likes.|`|siGX7EWwaa	If you're Edward Cullen I'm sure it is :D But yes, I've heard that from many a human guy.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	Yes!!!     Only though if its the girl i have a crush on though lol just cuz its so cute :D|`|dX97ZgAHaa	I was a terrible blusher when a teen and absolutely hated it.  However, I will also say that I never had problems getting or keeping boyfriends.  So they must like it!|`|AA10387455	The women I know don`t blush.|`|tPylwVbSaa	it absolutely is true|`|PGXMGlxGaa	Yep, girls should be timid...
5jMNBO2naa	ahh the old passion and fire argument    it has been said you get what you deserve  in that respect you got exactly what you deserved    as if you did not respect yourself enough, you would not take order from him and submit willingly to what ever he wants...    no one controls anyone.. one submits to another.. but no one controls anyone... so stop playing victim and pretending you are so weak and feeble minded    have some self respect, break it off with him, and stop feeding your face    you first issue is that you hooked up with him because you lack self esteem and self respect, and thus any guy who you feel will validate you will do... passion is not the issue, that's an excuse for fear that you have to prove yourself to some guy who can say they don't like you and you have to live with that, so you put up the no passion excuse to exclude a possible good for you guy|`|qfgb1eNpaa	ok heres the real question: should i be unhappy for 5 more months, or have to go to the gym for 2 weeks? theres your answer.|`|20LnuCejaa	Stick with overeating right now.  Eventually you will meet the right guy and... settle for nothing less.|`|iwvRBeXOaa	No no no. You need to step back and be single, because all you are doing is replacing one addiction with another and it's not healthy, nor is it any way to live your life.    First of all, you need to cut the ex out of your life completely. You know this, you just have to be strong. This means not calling him or texting him and at the same time not answering his texts or calls. If he gets upset that you are ignoring him tell him you can't be friends right now and need to move on by not talking to or seeing him.    Secondly, stop overeating. Whenever you feel upset you need to either call a friend, go out, or work out.    Finally, do NOT date a guy that you do not feel chemistry with just because he likes you and because you are lonely. Stop trying to fill the void, it is a sickness in a way. You have to learn to be on your own. You have to learn that being single is not the end of the world. Get some confidence in yourself.
WkdW04cNaa	I think that this will affect you for the rest of your life but you can grow through it.  If you accept the fact that this is how your father is and try and let it go.  You can always be who you want to be and how you want to be and know you don't ever want to be like him.  Drawing a boundary in your life will be good for you and for him.  If you keep yourself in a direction that is good for you and doesn't involve him than you will grow into your own man.  He has made his life the way it is......maybe one day he will look at what he has done and there is always a possibility for reconciliation.  It could take a very long time.  Just be who you are, but always respect his life and your family, and live the life that you want to live.  I am assuming that you are old enough to make these decisions.  If you are younger than 18, it's a completely different story.|`|Ove0qdhLaa	Okay I'm not sure if this will help because I didnt really know anything about you or your situation.    Personally I didnt think that you can cut off all emotions, I have tried to do that with one of my family members and all it did was make things worse. It worked for a little but then it just got too much for me to handle.    I cut my family member out of my life and I would do it again but the emotions are still there, I didnt think you can get rid of those feelings.    Try talking to him not positive that this will work but it might.    or    Talk to someone who you trust and you think can help.      Hope it all works out : )|`|HEvSVMeVaa	Talking with a counselor or therapist might help.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	i know how you feel he is an Ahole talks smart acts like he is the best thing that walk the face of this planet well he is not he is just a low life that would have been on the street if he was not marriage and how old r u?    also i am 14 and it went worse than you had it your are luck but that guy is out of my life for good never want him back i am glad or he would have been walking around with a black eye and i would have been in juvenile court!   but i did not i waited and it happened he screwed up by sleeping with some one else while married  that jerk well i hope this helps i had three year tell you mom and let her know mabey you could stay at your grandmas for a while thats what i did  and he took that away from me !|`|hQsvuxs3aa	TALK TO HIM! TELL YOUR MOM! CALL CHILD SERVICE'S!
yMyJ9Y6Aaa	Coming from a place very much like your own, the only way you can truly let go of him is to forgive him.  I know that it will be tough and it probably doesn't make sense, but when you choose to forgive someone, you cut off all power they had over you.  You  free yourself.  You are not saying that what they did was okay, but you forgive what they did to you.  Forgive him, and move on.|`|1ooElhpgaa	You don't say how old you are but you really need some help dealing with your feelings. If you are in school, talk with a trusted teacher or school counseler.  Also most Pastor's are trained in family matters and will keep your conversations private.  God said to respect our parents, not when they are perfect, but at all times.  You are learning a great lesson in how not to treat your children and you one day will be wonderful Dad.|`|diQ0oodqaa	Sorry, but I don't think you'll ever be able to do that completely.    Start filling your mind with what you want for yourself, what you want out of life and know that you are strong enough to have it, and you are.    Whenever the old worries and feelings come on, start building your life in your mind and keep trying to attain it. You are only a victim if you keep letting yourself be a victim--be what you want to be.
7AFLaiYjaa	there talking about you and one of them likes you.|`|i2iJNvdOaa	He probably likes you and his friends know he likes you.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Only time will tell.lf your interested,then you must try to get his attention.You can do this by discussing the game and being complimentary of his performance.even goodhearted criticism might be helpful
Y4C7ofKWaa	You are right to be upset-this is not normal and it's bad!  Usually the parents step in and separate the kids when it gets this bad.  I think they don't realize how bad it is.     You are both in a pattern-and it is going to continue unless something changes.       Your sister is going to continue-   be prepared for next time..   don't push her back, don't get involved, leave the room.   make up your mind ahead of time.  Talk to your parents.  Tell them that you don't want to fight with your sister, and you need their help as you don't know to fix it.     You can pray for God to help you.  Is there something that she wants that you could bribe her with?  I mean like -do you fight over what TV shows to watch?  maybe you can say, listen you can pick whatever shows you want if you won't push me around and get in fights.  or I will let you use my new radio etc.  if you won't fight with me...something that she wants-that you can get her to listen to you with.  It would be worth it-to have peace.        If things continue and don't get any better you could see about talking to a school counselor...but I would do that last as they may do something dramatic to fix it, and so that's only if you are really stuck.|`|4Hy97dkMaa	wow ur sis is mean|`|AA10186366	What a bully! That's horrible of her beating you up. I can't believe your parents won't do anything to stop this! No this is not normal & you should be more careful. Avoid her as much as you can. You should consult with someone you trust. Do you know why she does this? Don't hit her back though, it'll reinforce her behavior and it could get worse.    I think your sister is in pain, has something on her mind & can't express it in words & so she takes it out on you. OR she's just evil.    Have a private conversation with your parents. Tell her how your sister treats you [even if she already knows] & tell her that it pains you. DON't leave any detail out! Ask her to help you & to talk to her & ask her why she does it.
WkdW04cNaa	It's very normal for siblings to fight and not get along.  And it's also normal for parents to tell you to work it out because you need to learn those skills in life.  What isn't normal is blood and being unconscious.  If those two things are true than you need to back off from your sister because she seems to be taking it a bit too far and if your parents aren't helping than that is all you can really do.  The police wont do anything unless your parents are involved.  Have you told your parents about the blood and being knocked unconscious?  If not, maybe you should.  Most siblings fight all of the time and I really don't know why that is.  If I were you, I would not antagonize your sister EVER.|`|YKWP6Uo4aa	you're much better than me, because i would simply expel them from my life.. i wouldnt look or talk to her..i wouldnt even acknowledge her prescence...    you should really let your parents know how serious you are reporting this problem if it continues...what the hell are they waiting for? for her to accidently kill you or something?|`|kdN0iRdtaa	that is sooooo not normal ask her what is bothering her!!!|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Bullies are all about getting a reaction.  no reaction, no fun.  I know it's hard but if you don't react, she'll stop.  Ignoring her all together will make her the maddest.    It's very, very common for siblings to argue, even physically fight.  But it always takes 2 to do it.
fP46meSmaa	School girl dress with thigh high white stockings and no panties.Then bend over in front of me to pick something up.**|`|cV3VV549aa	a girl with great legs and pretty feet and a cute butt. gets me rockhard
IbX7hzH7aa	Honestly If I was the girl...    I would be a little bit shocked, unless it was talked about before.    If my boyfriend did this, I wouldnt really know how to react and would have in a selfish way wished he didnt. I would miss him dearly!!! And my heart would feel a little broken although its an honor to serve for the country.    Talk to her about it. But dont break up with her just because of this. Talk to her about it. But build up to it so she takes it well.     In the end, she might want to keep the relationship because she loves you too. And this would just be one of those obstacles couples go through.    Stay strong=]
aO0JSbHTaa	1. The first thing you do is do activites that you really enjoy or things that make you happy and get her out of your head.(hanging out with friends, playing sports etc.) dont just sit around thinking about it.    2. next, you tell yourself that eventually you will find someone else better and that there is nothing you can do but move on.    3. text every girl in your contacts just so you can sort of get rid of that "lonely" feeling.    4. listen to your favorite music, it works for me.|`|5jMNBO2naa	realize this     you matter more than she does    but you failed to realize this  so you give her far more significance in your life than she deserved  you basically said i cannot do better nor deserve better and she will be as good as i'll ever get    and that's a losing mentality    there is always another girl around the corner    fi open doe not work out  oh well, i find another  no time to look back and cry about someone who was not right  for you or did not fit who you are    if you are not meant to be, then it's because the differences in your life's at the moment are to great to over come, what ever they  are ( and those are not important right now )|`|rFpBSwWkaa	Its Hard but find other things to do. things that don;t remind u of her. try going new places to meet new people|`|3ErUtXb7aa	you cant you are in love|`|tW9vlAMZaa	this is so weird.   the same exact thing just happened to me :(   my bf broke up with me exactly 2 weeks ago & i swear im just a miserable wreck!

It dont work but you sure have a good time trying to forget..lol    I'd try hypnosis if you have any friends who have a intrest in that, and hypno you will only do what your conscience mind will let happen.  So dont be woried about acting like a chicken and all that stage crap you see on TV.  good luck     boogie boogie
Aof7ALmxaa	wat a creep as a friend! seriously she sounds like a b******. anyways haha moving on.. i would tell your friend that this is UR boyfriend and just inform her that last time wif ur ex it was weird and u didn't no wat to do and that this time she should bak off from ur man.     hope i helped :) haha
jlXPsVfdaa	Since I am the nice guy, I have to advocate the nice guy's case.    Essentially you need to look long term.  Do you want momentary thrills or do you want a nice long term?  You will have grown up when you look at the long term.|`|l0Eyx582aa	I'm more attracted to the nice guy myself. Jerks never really held my interest... Nice guys can be macho too, but not in the jerky way. :)|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	Looks aren't everything.. i learned that.. just because you're less attracted to a guy, doesn't mean you dont like them more.... it just means that their looks aren't as important to you as their personality...
SEifPqWlaa	My answer is to be careful...  That's what an 11 years age difference...  I guess its not too bad cuz I know someone who is with someone who is 30-some years older than she is...  But the reason I say be careful is mainly just because of her family...  (That's the real problem that my friend had, but now to them its like age never mattered...)|`|6Keiydlpaa	It is very natural to want to date her. I would say it is ok as long as she is not your student. if you feel she likes you a lot then ask her on a date. If you feel the magnetic attraction then she is ready for a date.   Ciao,  Carie  ps.. dont forget the flowers! we still love that!

869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	There's a HUGE amount of denial involved in domestic violence or abusive behaviors within a family.    There's certain stereotypes, family positions that people don't want upset, plus family reputations that people don't want tarnished.  Unfortunately, it often happens that family will turn on the whistleblower.  There's really nothing to do but distant yourself from the family at that point, as they are painting you as a liar or crazy.|`|hQsvuxs3aa	CHILD SERVICES!|`|BhJVJ3Vhaa	police or if you dont want to get them in trouble then maybe get them to a therapist...

P4SgSnVlaa	You cannot grieve as much for someone you hardly knew, even if you are related by blood, it's the emotional bonds and memories that really tear us apart. So don't worry, you shouldn't think yourself as a bad person or anything. Plus, people grieve in different ways. For some people the real impact doesn't actually hit straight away... either they don't want to accept they're gone or it's just the initial shock of their death that takes them back. Some people never really accept/understand/take in the fact that this person is really 'gone' forever, so they don't grieve properly. Some don't even know how to grieve... it's different and difficult for everyone.     Your mum is the real person suffering here though, so anything she may do/say out of character is her way of grieving and coping with the situation. Let your mum know how you feel about the situation, tell her that you really miss her, you really loved her.. and support your mother too in any way you can.|`|3d15975f2ec516fd628eea6593e5ab6caa	Its ok my cousin recently died and i didnt show emotion until the funeral this doesnt mean your wrong or anything there just really wasnt a bond so it wasnt broken so theres no need to cry|`|WkdW04cNaa	Your mom is probably just concerned about you.  She may wonder if you really are okay in dealing with this death.  Death is very difficult for most people.  Give her some time or just make sure she knows that you are okay.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	She's just upset and thinks that you should be grieving the same way that she is.  Let it go and have patience with her, she will see that you are handling this loss in your own way.|`|KwNpyp3saa	I am sorry for your loss. Everyone grieves differently. Some are more emotional than others. They are still affected by the loss of your grandmother and aren't thinking straight. They probably feel like you aren't grieving "properly" and don't miss your grandmother. Your family knows you and knows that you aren't an emotional person. Don't be surprised if it does hit you like a ton of bricks. This is ok too. If you want to keep it to your self, that's fine. If you want to share it with your family they will welcome your feelings. Take care.|`|2Om1LosMaa	I'm sure your mom is shaken, that was her mom, however, noone can tell you how to feel. You are okay. Be there for your mom and comfort her, that's all you can do.

Cuz you'd sound kinda clingy/stalkerish    or say hi, and he will obv say who's this? and don't respond for a while, it'll leave him hanging ;) and then respond with just your first name, and then who's this? it won't make you look like a stalker and he says "blank" and how did you get my   and you'd say one of my friends gave it to me, and I just added it to my phone, so I didn't know who it was, I was just trying to find out who it was, haha. or something along those lines thats shorter.|`|6HgiNCmqaa	Just say hey what ya doin?  it doesnt sound desperate, nore careless|`|CKTt9py6aa	Say something nice and friendly.|`|dNTAPAIAaa	homework.|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfZItov1B...|`|qlCwiXpyaa	id just be like, hey its [your name]!!! and then if he ever asks how you got his number just be like oh, you gave it to me, remember?|`|u0Tdlw5Xaa	"Hey, this is Dudette.

XK6k2UAIaa	Love is different to everyone. Love to me is that feeling that everything will be ok. That laugh that no one else understands. That smiles that lights up the day because you know they want you and only you. That's feeling you get when they say I love you while looking deep in your eyes as if they are saying please never let go. There is so much meaning in the word love that the only way to know what it truly is is to feel it yourself.|`|x22uyDa9aa	-.- someone got to this before me and already said it.    Thanks for two points though.|`|g0q6ny9qaa	well love is what you make of it. there is no precise Definition. It is not like a word that you can look up.

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.     Love never fails....And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. (NIV)|`|qsWPdiuraa	Really hard to explain... maybe it's not even possible to describe it in words.  I might not know completely what it is, but my understanding is that it's caring for someone more than you care about yourself. Feeling happy when you're with them, and willing to give up some things for that person. I guess it could be a bit of physical attraction, but not all though. I really strongly disagree that love comes from sex. But I think it desire could also be a little part in love... Just stuff like that... It's something really strong and deep too, that I don't really know how to explain with words...  Well, that's all I can explain I guess. It's a question I've been wondering myself too. Right now, this is the best answer I can come up with.  Hope it helped! =D|`|tqvWD5RQaa	Well... Love is something different for everyone...  Love for a mother its the eternal love that starts before your ever born and last forever it is constant and can never be broken  Love for a friend is developed over time, knowing they will always be there, trusting, feeling secure  Being in Love is the greatest feeling in the world it gives you butterflies when new, it can make your heart jump, so many different emotions... so Love to me is a feeling that expresses deep emotion without words that only your body can express.|`|ENspyhzUaa	baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more

P4SgSnVlaa	Tell your mum the reason why you want to have it. I expect (well, hope) it's not because 'the other girls have it', but it's because you want a way to express yourself, to be yourself, to accessorise. Earrings are accesories, yes? And are widely accepted in almost every country of the world, almost every religion. In fact in quite a few religions it is compulsory to have nose/ear piercings. Btw, in no way is it against Christianity..     It is best really to keep your parents happy as long as you are living under their roof, but they cannot actually stop you from doing anything at your age as you know, especially over something fairly petty.     I got my nose pierced at 16. At first I asked my parents if it was alright and my mum was fine with it, but my dad threw a huge hissy-fit about the whole thing saying they're ugly, pointless and I was just doing it to 'fit in'. That shows how much he knows about his own daughter... plus in a school of about 1600 kids, probably only 10 girls had nose piercings. A month or so after his fit, I thought it over but still was set on getting the piercing. I wasn't going to go out and get it behind their backs, so I told him I was going to get it whatever he thought, but I thought he should at least know I was going to get it done. As much as he still hated the idea, he respected that I'd told him and said nothing more. Later that day when I came back with the piercing, he actually said it looked nice and suited me.     Really, your mum should realise you are old enough to make your own decisions (and mistakes, if this turns out bad). We really need to learn things for ourselves sometimes, from experience... not just what we've been told. It's called living. Good luck with the piercing :)|`|BhJVJ3Vhaa	do you want to get your nose pierced because people will think its cool or more cause you know that now you have the opportunity to? i cant really make your decision for you but respect you mother, on the other hand maybe you should get one because like you said you are 18! they can get infected very easily but if you tell your mom when she comes back from africa that you got a nose ring she will notice how responsible you are. did you ever think that maybe you guys don't get along because she doesn't want to think of you as a grown up even though you are? and maybe that's the same case with the nose ring she thinks you are growing up too fast. well i hope this helped and good luck!!!|`|GuYRsad0aa	i think you should get one. if you've been waiting for a while and are determinted to get on: go for it. i doubt ur mom will disown u for it|`|80Bgu8ZIaa	Well your obviously mad at your mom. I completely agree with you, but remember, if she comes back to see you disrespected her, she will be very angry and will not let you live it down. she will probably say you are a bad daughter, even though it is not true. If I had a strict mom like her, I would get it done when I would move out. Even though you are 18, you are still living under her roof. Atleast thats how my dad is...
0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	she doesn't see you like that. she won't like you til she gets over her boyfriend.
tG8matgBaa	She needs time to heal. but at least you know she likes you  just treat her as a friend for a while, support her, do fun things to take her mind off the the other guy.     i'm sure she'll let you know when she's ready  tell her she can talk to you about anything, learn to trust each other  in my experience the best way to begin a relationship is as friends
ztR13XyJaa	You told him to text you so he really doesn't have a right to be mad, but I would txt him just incase

e494eb1e544153fbeed8117f34b95807aa	It isn't selfish to want a new one for yourself. It is nice that your parents gave you the phone you are currently using. Have you tried to talk with them? They might just be willing to listen to you if you have shown that you have been responsible enough to work & pay for your own. Parents can be surprising sometimes :).|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	some way for me sneak out and buy a pay as you go!|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Try asking them?    I can't see how a reasonable person/parent would want to stop their child from working hard and saving up to buy themselves something they want, in fact that's most parent's idea of nirvana!    Work, save, buy.|`|4hr9JGAdaa	save up for a new phone and buy one , and take your sim card and put it in your new phone.|`|tvWm1e4naa	it's easy. there are a lot of phone companies that offer free phone with  o1r 2 year contract. though most of the phones they offer are older model you can ask about their latest free celfone model and be inquisitive about the plans they offer. choose the same plan that you have right now( or lower) if you don't use your phone that much. so that your parents won't complain about it. Be careful though, some companies will try to rip you off so if you're ok with your current celfone company, you might want to ask them first.|`|RvddYKqjaa	You seem pretty young, but you could get a job. If you can pay for it yourself, and pay the monthly bills yourself, and buy yourself another one when you lose it or break it, then you would be able to get a phone. Something tells me that your parents are paying something, somewhere. I think it's sad that you expect them to give you a new phone everytime you need one, and that you complain they just give you another old phone.   I think that when you can cover all of the bills yourself, and you can show that you are responsible, they will be willing to let you buy your own phone. Personally, if I lost my phone and some one just gave me an old one, I would be very pleased.   I guess your parents would like to know why you want/need a new phone if you still have one. I bet too that your parents have their side of this story to tell.  EDIT: I just saw that you are 13, but you feel you can go to school and go to work, to make enough to pay for your phone each month. I believe I know what your parents are doing.  I agree with them.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Why won't they let you have one if you pay for it yourself???  That doesn't seem fair.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	looks like you're gonna have to wait until you're 18 to get a "new" phone...|`|zfGJ3YD3aa	well if you make the money yourself and everything they don't exactly need to know until after you've bought it do they? so find a nice one that's not to expensive and buy it yourself OR smash your old one so they ave to buy you one :)|`|hvgXADgfaa	If you REALLY want to get a new phone and dont care as long as it is newer, go to a local store and get a pre-paid one.

For example, I really wanted my belly button pierced but my mom was totally against it. But I made a deal with her...that I would take Spanish 3 if she let me get it.  It worked!  Something like that.|`|RbCsBbhLaa	You should just wait until they give you a new one. It will happen soon but if you keep bugging them they will get annoyed.   good luck!!|`|6X7qTFvhaa	the only thing you can do is come to some agreement with your parents if that doesnt work ask your aunt or uncle to give you a phone under there name and you help them with stuff or help pay for it and dont forget to ask them to keep it a secret from your parents hope you get it i need a new phone myself|`|6PVFDHnzaa	yea after 3 years anyone deserves a new phone! why wouldn't they let you have a new phone if you pay for it yourself? sry bout that. the trick when asking parents for stuff is to ask them in a way that they can relate to it. but i'm not thinking of any good ideas right now. just don't ask them and say 'because everyone else has a nice phone.'     so you're for certain that they will give you an old phone if you loose your current one even if you say that you'll pay for it? I'd spend a couple days sucking up to them and then slowly drop the hint that you would like a new phone. and yea like some of the others had said it would help if your b-day is coming up.      or here's a thought. valentines is coming up and you could drop the hint that you might like a new phone as a daddy-daughter gift or something like that.     save some $$ and get someone older to buy one off ebay. they have lots of new phones on there. make sure to get one that works with your service whoever you use.  hope u get one!|`|71f2930ee535098af1f6581cea1d859faa	Ask your friends to help you out.|`|mDTkpuiuaa	tell them if you don't get a new, cool, and amazing phone, then you'll be kicked out of the kool kids klub.  worked for me.|`|zKuP2nqMaa	if your birthdays coming up then talk to a few of your friends to give you money as a present also with grandma's ect... or see if one of them is getting a new pone and see if you can have it..

wKSvnna2aa	Probably she acts that way because she wants her parents back together and sees you as a threat. A lot of fairy tales read to children always have an "evil step-mother" in them, so to her you are the villain. (I'm not saying you are, it's just I'm trying to look at the situation through her eyes.) I think you can try to become friends with her, but gradually. Take her shopping, or take an interest in what she likes. But if that doesn't work, you maybe should just leave. Hope things will turn out fine with you.    Good luck.|`|okh3hL8taa	He is not going to change his feelings for his daughter.  Either you accept this "flaw" in him or you don't.

EYmgAUgaaa	Wow, that's some story.  Sorry about what you're going through.  I have to commend you on your decision to give up your life as you know it to help out family.  However, everyone has a breaking point, and it seems you have reached yours.    Have you tried getting your family together and talking to them.  Basicially, let them know that (for whatever reason) you can't take it anymore.  Give them the choice on what to do considering you are not there to help.  What would they change?  Are they willing to go to an assisted living facility?      It's just an idea to try if you haven't.  You understand that while things are bad now, they are most likely to get worse in the future.  What if you uncle develops medical problems like cirrhosis from his drinking?  Are you going to be the one taking him back and forth to doctors and hospitals?
Sai9Y9Puaa	tell her.    Sure there is a chance you are going to be rejected , but there is also going to be a chance where you might not get rejected.

As for personality....not even the nicest person in the world is like by everyone....some people can't stand ceratin things about them.    My point is...you are probably liked by many people. But you probably have a confidence issue. I know women who think they are overweight but actually look great especially since they are actually in shape and no matter what I say....they still think they are fat.    There are people in your life that like you. If you are in high school...when you get older things will change. If you are older...be more direct with getting to know people.|`|Mkroj9gPaa	it doesnt matter if you're pretty! if you're mean and nasty and stuck up, no one will like you. analyze your personality.|`|PBV7uP9caa	depends on ur definition of pretty|`|ZUZezAwLaa	be yourself and be patient you'll find someone eventually and when you do all the waiting will be so worth it|`|cxqzLUlmaa	Do you have big ankles?|`|jFvHzKn9aa	umm no self confidence is all i can tell since ure asking this question in the first place|`|TyjaOszKaa	Its probably your attitude, or demeanor....maybe no one gets to know you...the real you because of how you act....try just observing from now on....just watch...sit back and observe|`|lMzWMxz7aa	There probably jealous. Don't let them bother you.|`|YZez6mheaa	well, maybe you just sometimes act funky or something. if they dont really like you then find some better people to hang out with. maybe if you bring them a treat they will start to like you. if they do any classes to dance or something you should join them in a class.
MbHwygxbaa	Yea I think he likes you, hes prob just embarresed in front of his friends
seMpUL8Kaa	Indigestion?|`|7quYBN4gaa	take a deep breath. either you're getting a bug or you have anxiety thinking about her. which is normal when you like someone and worry about outcomes. ask her if she wants to make it official. i know easier said than done but at least it's one less thing to worry about. if you guys are already in this stage of a relationship make it official and if she doesn't then she's just looking for a possible f buddy good luck!|`|AA12306220	Maybe your sick o-o
mYAbq6fnaa	find something that you have in common, then bond over that. maybe invite her to go to an art musuem or ask her what project she is working on now, just something to strike up a conversation. if she sees that you have something in common, she'll see that it would be fun to hang out with you.|`|1SCU8vXeaa	suggest going to the movies or getting some lunch together or maybe shopping?|`|5mIS49JXaa	start talking with her..

twVyisGnaa	You know what?  Your mom and sister should love you whether you are bisexual or gay or whatever.  If they can't accept you for what you like, then they suck.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.lf your sister knows then it's almost certain that mom is aware of your situation.Generally parents don't embrace this life style for their children.However these same parents love,respect and trust their children very much.So try to ignore any derogatory remarks made about this issue.They mean well and just wish you all the best.Their idle criticism is'nt meant to hurt or offend|`|KqPd8QOOaa	you nutter, how many different people can u be, how many different tales can u spin, u really need some professional help.  *middle finger*  seriouslyy, in every question ur a different person

UP33GlBwaa	If she has a bf, then definitely back off and forget about it.

If she doesn't care enough to break up with him, break up with HER.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	suicide|`|kWBXSjHXaa	SHAZAM
EdidZdtlaa	tell him how you feel and ask him what you should do. ask him what he would do if he felt the way you do. but tell him that you think of him more like a brother than a bf.
0tKNkAMuaa	This is very hard to do.... ugh....but there are a few options...I know how you feel, cause sometimes I'm in the same boat. You don't want to look stupid or be obvious, or tell your friends that you want him to notice you because they might do something non-expected. Try moving closer to him and his group of friends, but make sure there is something you want by where they are. Then you and your friends could hang out around there. But if it isn't awkward talk to him, ask him for his e-mail or something. If you want his e-mail go by him, and tell one of your friends that you changed your e-mail, then give her yours. It could be the same one, and then you could just say you forgot. I know it sounds stupid, but it could work. You could also text someone in front of him, and he might ask you his number. If he is interested in you he might do this, unless he is super shy. Hope I was some help!
ypJt6poOaa	I definetely want a lot of siblings. My mom is pregnant and i have a 1 yr old bro.but i really want my mom to have more b/c big famillies are awesome|`|S2dM6AANaa	i'm the youngest of 4 and believe me that's enough.  lol|`|KwNpyp3saa	I guess I wanted more siblings. At the time I wanted one or two who were closer to my age. My sister is four years younger. We weren't close then and we aren't close now. Although I don't think it has to do with our age difference.     I can understand the feeling of less love when you are sharing your parents with a lot of siblings. You know parents love all of their kids equally- yet differently. So, even though this may be the feeling you still have all of those other siblings who you can talk to and confide in. More people to look after you and you the same.|`|AA11447210	I have an older sister and younger brother..at 72 I don't think my mother is going to produce any more kids.    Three of us was plenty, in my mind. I never had the desire to be part of a large family, and have never had the desire to have kids of my own.    You may or may not want "a lot" (2 words) of kids when you're grown. Depends on the life you choose and of course your partner as well.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	My mom can't have any other kids so I only have one other brother but I grew up with three cousins who are really close to me like brothers. My mom used to keep them while their parents are at work so they were always around. It wasn't really bad, but I don't know how I would feel about having so many siblings. I think I'm happy with just having the one i've got|`|HOedKyX2aa	I want 3-4 children, I came from just having one younger brother and i always wanted older siblings!

And nope it's not "cheaper" by the dozen...that's a movie, not real life.  Having a lot of siblings means handing things down, especially clothing.  I was lucky in the fact that I am the oldest girl...my youngest sisters all wore my "hand me downs" when they could fit into them.  I have two older brother's and I usually wound up wearing a lot of their tee shirts and sweat shirts even in high school.  My parents always managed to give us kids a lot of one on one time though.  I don't know if having a lot of siblings makes one want a lot of children.  I have three and that's all I ever want.  One of my siblings has 8 children.  One has only two.  My father came from a very large family, 14 children in all...I have three cousins who are only children.
tFC13Xsgaa	get another gf|`|8q4RhpZWaa	I was depressed, but I wanted to deny it. I began to have thoughts of how to commit suicide. I knew that I was very discouraged because the events in my life were not going in the direction that I wanted or expected them to go. But could I really be depressed? Was suicide a possibility? Surely, I could deal with this! I didn't need help. I could handle this on my own. After all, things weren't that bad, were they?    Then menacing thoughts began entering my head - ways to commit suicide. I wondered how to tie the right knot to create a noose. Would that pole up there be strong or high enough to hang myself? Would I have the physical capability to accomplish such a feat? These methods of suicide were frightening thoughts. Where had they come from? How had they gotten into my head?    Later, the thoughts became more insistent. It was as if these thoughts had a character all their own, a separate entity, that had somehow taken residence inside my brain. I was starting to get worried and wondered if I needed help. I was not moving beyond this and the horrifying thoughts were getting worse!    I didn't tell anyone about these thoughts. They were so horrific to me - to my usual upbeat, outgoing personality. I was afraid to tell people for fear that they would minimize my feelings and make me feel ashamed. They might reject me and I couldn't deal with those reactions. I was trying so hard to cope with what was happening to me. I wanted to be strong. I wanted to believe in God. I tried very hard to think positively. Maybe I could purge that terrifying intruder who had begun to reside in my brain!    I attempted to deal with the depression on my own, but the insistent voice became stronger. I reached a point where I figured out a method of suicide and wondered how I should phrase the suicide note that I would leave for my family. One part of my brain mulled these thoughts in a totally irrational manner while the more rational part of my brain knew suicide was wrong and that it would destroy my family. It was almost as though I were two people at times - the person controlled by this insistent voice and the other part of me that loved God and believed that He did have a good plan for my life in spite of the painful trial that I was so deeply immersed in.|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Yo what is up with girls and staying great friends with an ex? What the hell man really.    I am in your position, except it was been a couple of months. I am over her. You have to realize that everything happens for a reason.

(...i kno this aint makin yu feel better right now but at least im tryin to stay positive... right?)|`|y9RMeP2Daa	well you have to go with the idea that everything happens for a reason, and maybe this breakup is for  you to find a wonderful girl, even better than the last girl. the wound also heals in time. try to busy yourself with things, so you WONT think of her. soon you will forget her. if being great freinds is hard for you, you should tell her that you can not be "great" freinds, and maybe not even freinds. hopefully this helps, and i hope things will work out with you!|`|ATqWlp8aaa	You don't. You at this point have to sink or swim. Either stay strong and wait it out until the feelings eventually go away.

Enjoy your date .|`|8q4RhpZWaa	Boys are very complicated? they are not like women as you can read more about women lifestyle at www.womendiarynet, and they do not just want to be used as fashion statements. So if you want a boyfriend, make sure that you like him and are willing to be in a serious commitment with him, or at least you feel you may be if you get to know him better, and won't break his heart. Below are some things that show ways to get your man by your side as your dating    First, if you do not already know him, then introduce yourself. If he is interested in you enough to want to get to know you better himself, he will add in some women conversation eventually.  Show him interest in his life.  Make it easy for him to be friendly and talkative with you, but not overpowering.  Invite him to a party? but not just to make out with him or anything, be friendly with him alone until he makes it clear that he really likes you, and wants to be around you.  At this point, just be yourself and let things unwind themselves.    Here is some simple women lifestyle personality dating tips :  If the person you like is shy, then be very gentle to him but admire him for his strengths, few men can resist being told how manly they are unless the girl who tells them is one they are very uninterested in.  Do not be afraid, if you feel you can go up to him without him bashing your heart against the wall (whether on purpose or not) and you notice his seeming interest in you, then you are probably okay.    And..  Do not use him? boys may be bad about using women, but they can still be weak around an irrisistable women even if they are not interested in her, which means breaking your heart and merely adding on his horrible guilt, or having a stalker who wants you for the WRONG reasons. So do not parade yourself around boys too much, for both your own good and their own good and your dating.  This article is free for republishing|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Oh sweety , you are SO cute.

kUZEYNmNaa	I can only speak in generalities but many people practice non penetrative sex. It can be just as satisfying as penetrative sex and often leads to sex moving in directions.    I don't know what 'undesirable' means in your case, maybe she just didn't fancy sex. She's probably be the one to ask.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	The invitation should have stated whether there was a meal, usually by an insert asking for a preference (beef, chicken, etc.)  It sounds like evening wear or cocktail attire would be appropriate.  If the church is no longer an active church of worship, I wouldn't be very concerned about what to wear based on venue, but more the time of day.  I'm sure the bride or groom (which ever one you know) would be happy to field a question or two since they didn't seem to do a very thorough job on the invitation and what guests should expect.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	dinner dress, semi-formal, cocktail...(nothing too long and you need to feel comfortable)  reception and wedding same clothes (YOU don't change, the bride does, sometimes) reception is usually a meal...(you can always call and ask...)  don't wear white (it's the brides day) don't wear a hat, you're inside...don't look like a hooker, don't be loud, and don't get drunk. Be a lady.|`|4lL34wJnaa	Usually for a wedding, unless the bride or groom tell you differently, a woman should wear a nice dress and a man should wear a suit.  To be sure, ask whoever invited you!|`|sEFmjAJkaa	ask the Brides Family.......  they would KNOW.........|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Sounds dressy.I would wear a dress with nice heals.They are definitely serving dinner and you wear the same thing to both.Hope this helps....|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Wear the same thing to the ceremony as the reception, and if it doesn't stipulate on the invite that there's going to be dinner at the reception (which, I'm surprised it doesn't, seeing as how that's the dinner hour), I'd grab a bite in between the ceremony and the reception.    As for what to wear, something nice ! Not "red carpet" nice, but something tasteful that doesn't show too much skin. Since it's in the evening, darker colors and thicker fabrics are acceptable, but avoid black. It's a wedding, not a funeral, unless it's a nice longer black skirt with a top (in a color other than black or white - no white at weddings!) that you can dress up with some pretty statement jewelry, and maybe some strappy shoes with some kind of sparkle. Keep it simple and don't overthink everything.    :D|`|DQkDQraOaa	I would assume it would be like any other wedding that you have gone to. And yes, dinner would be expected.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Why not ask the bride or someone else who is involved in the planning? It is hard to tell just by the time and venue.|`|f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	The best authority for this is the bride, brides maid or someone closely involved in the planning.  As a female guest, a dressy conservative outfit would be appropriate.  Skirt or dress but not pants.  An understated hat and gloves would also be acceptable and stylish.    You don't need the hat or glove for the reception but the same outfit should be okay.|`|1ooElhpgaa	I would go with casual evening.  No pants, a pretty knee length dress with appropriate jewelry.  No long dress and furs. Have your hair done and wear evening type makeup and you will be fine!  The important thing to remember as any wedding guest is not to outdress the bride or the bridal party.    Call the Ballroom and inquire about the food.  The bride doesn't need to know that you called.  I have done this due to dietary requirements and I know if I should eat before I go to an event.

Because it usually works at my school.  Although I'm only in middle school people say I give pretty good advice sometimes.  I'm not so sure though  ;]
mL07N3IAaa	first of all, you can't force the girl to like you. it would make it even worse. second, she sounds like a ***** that wouldn't respect your feelings towards her. even if she did say yes, she would use you and break your heart sooner or later. so please just move on and find someone else that will treat you better!     ~ good luck!

You know, the classic girl stuff.|`|RTxFNURzaa	you stand in front of him and he will see and he'll know you exist lol|`|vTNWiFPwaa	well you obviously have never talked to him.  he doesn't know you so thats why he said no.  and also, your FRIEND asked him out for you.  if i was in that position, i'd say no.  and since you don't know him.  how can u like him.  obviously you just like him cuz he's cute and thats shallow.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well their are plenty of reasons: he may have not liked the way you were held back , you may think you are pretty and many others but he may not find you attractive, trying to show off for his friends, he doesn't know you that well, or you are not his type of girl.   You can either just continue to have a crush on him and then slowly you will stop liking him.  OR  Since you are in the same P.E. class, you should try your best in it. Like, get your team the most points. You have to impress him and get yourself more noticed. When you keep getting points, your team will say "You go girl" and be proud of you and give you high fives and stuff, this will bring more attention to you. Even if you guys are on opposite teams the next time you guys have to pick teams, he may want you on the team or may talk to you more.     Good Luck|`|rhuM3r5naa	well don't freak out because he said no.he probaly said no because your friend asked him out for you!if he thinks your too young now well, its because little kids send people to ask other people out!You have to SHOW him your not a kid!you know what i mean!i didnt even get guys until i started wering heels and got contacts.but dont compleatly change or it will be ovious what your doing.act like your self just jaz it up a little.|`|jSH47SN7aa	try a little bit harder all you can do is try or become friends with him and find out what he likes|`|EiS6jnApaa	Try to be in his group for anything in gym, joke around with him, and dont be quiet.  Even if you are talking to other people, make sure you are always social.    Once you get to know him, maybe ask him to hang out sometime when you both arnt sweaty ;)    P.S. Dont get your friend envolved. It makes it worse.|`|XmhYNlumaa	U SHOULD GET TO KNOW HIM BETTER.|`|lqN2WfEuaa	Send him a box of chocolates with your photo at the bottem , then write ur name and say i got these for you. if he doesnt think he likes you.. he must be perty dumb.|`|9vz7TIKWaa	most males never "don't know (she/I) exist" there's numerous reasons why he didn't come over there. you'd be surprised at my reasons for not going to movies or hanging out with friends. most of the time i try to say as little as possible. if i was you i would talk to him up front.    edit: don't do any thing you've seen on tv, the only thing worse than him not knowing you, is him knowing you as "the kid who's an idiot"
IbX7hzH7aa	I would say no. Practice makes perfect.     And you could teach him indirectly.     Guide him with your lips.    Maybe he just lacks experience.    Maybe you could be flirtatious about how you want him to kiss you. Like out your lips like this....and show him. But be flirty about it, so he wont know your really teaching him.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	Nope.. practice makes perfect!|`|swJuTXcSaa	If it bothers u now it will bother u later.she should dump u. GL|`|y6BvpRtyaa	Yes|`|nDQOwAA3aa	no theirs bigger things to worry about|`|6X7qTFvhaa	nope.|`|2F4vkfnxaa	yes and no,  yes because that is what you would have to live through until you guys breakup for some unfortunate reason,  and no because if you really like him, being a bad kisser shouldn't really matter. unless it was totally gross, but then you could always be honest and tell him the truth, but who knows, he may think you are a bad kisser and he is a great one.  either way, i don't personally think its right to break up with someone because of that, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do!  :)|`|PhBAJtkVaa	hell no.|`|wm2Jjcx4aa	no... you just should make them keep practicing :P|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	Depends how bad they are but I would say yes.|`|5gDbscPKaa	that thinking is childish and inmature. it can be imp[roved with more practice....lol.|`|ABBHp6iSaa	If you don't enjoy kissing someone, then that will change how much you like or dislike them. If their kissing bugs you so much that all you think about is how bad it is, then I would say yes.|`|VXg6Xwm3aa	TEACH THEM
LGkb4xibaa	one of my friends does it all the time. Its just 'his thing'. Men are strange creatures! Just make light of it. And yeah... Definately burn your clothes. :)|`|hQsvuxs3aa	burn them!|`|diQ0oodqaa	I would put it out of my head and never tell a soul--best friend, parents, yahoo answers--no one!! He is your brother, love him and let him be. He is probably sick with worry right now over what you saw.    If it makes you feel better, talk to him about it, but don't fuss at him. Give him a hug and tell him no one else will ever know.|`|2gRCYwP7aa	Strutt around in his !!!!|`|nBQeSu2faa	You need to ask him why he is dressing up ,before jumping to any conclusions.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	I don't have a bro but I'd probably sit him down and ask him if he's a tranny and if he is could he please not wear my nice clothes, I'd take him shopping if he wanted though. You should probably chuck the thong away though, that's gross.|`|Kr11ceLOaa	hahaa tell him to get his own cloth  jk he is gay!!|`|QQbbReRAaa	LOL, throw out the thong, and tell him to get his own girls clothes!. Maybe you could go halves? share your wardrobe!. Could be a good thing!.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	i saw my boyfriend in my clothes and then he ripped my jeans trying to sit down. its not strange guys do that stuff all the time esp for dress day at school|`|BC9nPXG7aa	REVENGE!!!! HA HA HA!!!!|`|kdN0iRdtaa	maybe he is on drugs?????????????? |`|BhJVJ3Vhaa	as a joke or if he is gay i wouldnt care but its mean to say you would burn them he is your bro for crying out loud...maybe you should have a talk with him b4 you jump to conclusions.|`|wKSvnna2aa	That's very disturbing... I think you should just ask him why, and talk it out. It could be he wants to become a girl, or is attracted to you (i.e. mentally unstable).|`|0XkUfE2Paa	I think I'd just laugh, and be a bit grossed out for a while! Overall it's quite funny! Just joke around with him, don't make it uncomfortable.|`|WYYZV5Bcaa	if I were a girl and my sister was a boy, I would have just laughed at them, taken photos and put on Facebook, Myspace and bebo :).|`|2Y5rSTRZaa	What would I do? Scream "THE HORROR!"  I'd guess it was either a dare or he's a cross dresser.. Either way, start talking.|`|WkdW04cNaa	There is nothing you can do about it!!!!|`|2240fe569394d14380a5ffd23ea1dac2aa	dont get mad and dont tell anybody (let him) just tell him not to wear your clothes. i had the same problem but my brother was much younger we had a fight i was so pissed. but as time went on i knew it was him and he is my brother no matter what|`|FbuXn5AZaa	Tell him to go and get changed ...... can't have a serious convo with all that on!     I would Sit down and talk to him, ask him why he is doing, does anyone know and does he do it all the time/ever go out with it on    I don't know how you feel about it ....but just deal with it, he is still your brother no matter what|`|qMXk1GRgaa	Congratz u just have a sister, :D LOL
dX97ZgAHaa	When people say *it was love at first sight" I think that's rubbish.  It takes months and years to fully love someone. You need to share good times and bad, be loyal, let them see you with your biggest spot, your worst PMS an know that this person will love you whatever.  So, I say it is lust. And to all those people that believe in love at first sight, remember, it starts off as a strong feeling of attraction and lust which grows steadily into love. The honeymoon period is good in a relationship, but you cant beat that fantastic feeling of established love with someone.|`|9gYEzV6zaa	hmm. to me, the symptoms do seem like love but hey i aint no pro on that.
Rw4NmTbsaa	Hi honey, speaking from experience most guys will go for the thin girl until they get to know the "chubby girl" better, generally we have better personailities and are less high maintanance as we haven't been able to rely on our looks for our adolescence. So talk to him in a friendly manor don't come on too strong, maybe find soem stuff in common with him. if he's really shallow enough to care about looks then maybe wear clothes that show cleavage subtly or if you have good legs because legs,*** and boobs always win when competing with a fork like figure, it's human nature.   x  Oh jebus, your 12ish? it's way too early for you to care about this stuff! and if you do just reliase it gets easier as you get older, but it's impossible for a 12yearold to be sexy just deal with beign a kid before you jump into adulthood|`|Nz7Dqss7aa	You're in the sixth grade. You do NOT need to want to be sexy, and you don't need to be in relationships that early... that's my opinion, and I know yours may be different.  When you're in the sixth grade, you're about 12 years old. Personally, I think 12 is too young to be dating or caring about your appearance to the extreme of calling yourself chubby and a little ugly in comparison to sexy.    If you want people to talk to you, just be yourself. You wouldn't want to be someone else just to get people to like you, that would be lying to yourself.
dnoJPmG7aa	Sounds like the two of you are keeping score of personal injuries that the both of you inflict on each other.  If you really want this person as a friend & it sounds like you do start being honest with yourself & him. Both of you are not being mature about this situation at all. This must be stressful for yourself & everyone at work. Stop the tension & just talk it out. This sounds like alot of unnecessary drama.     Keeping score of personal injury & holding back friendship or thinking about how to treat someone from past injuries is just toooooo much of a waste of time & energy.      Someone once told me that if you live in the past you die in the past. It's not healthy to keep dwelling on things & over analyzing what has happened.     Just move on....forgive & forget...alot of people do the first part of the phrase they forgive then they don't forget..then your right back where you started & nothing is accomplished.|`|qMXk1GRgaa	what kind of comment did u say anyway?, it must have been harsh, anyway if he's trying to make up, just try to forgive him, i think its for the best. the past is the past, he's making it up because he is regretting what he did to you, there's no point in living in the past argument. All i can advice is forgive and move on, and make the best of it.    - Good luck :D   -Kuyamay2|`|mzWnHsixaa	this is so high school get over it.|`|IUlIixJLaa	You were right to give your honest opinion and he has no business treating you badly..I would have a long talk with him about exactly what you wrote here|`|W6uHaI1kaa	i think that you should tell him that your not friends but you not enemies. just be normal... if you need to talk about work or something it would be ok but at the same time you wouldnt want to go to lunch or something. Be normal|`|HBM1qu0Saa	Everybody is entitled to a mistake. Thank goodness for that.    If he is making overtures to become friends again, it would seem to me that he realizes his error, and wants to make up for it.    By all means, let him, it is good for his character!|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Tell him this: "I will be happy to talk with you about all this, if you would please understand that I was being your friend giving you my honest opinion. Would you rather I lied,blew smoke up your a** and and said something else? You asked me my opinion and then s**t all over me, so we need to clear the air about that, first.    Next, we need to clear the air about all the other times I tried to get thru to you but you wouldn't talk to me.    So now you want to talk ... ok, let's talk. First, your art ... "    That's how I operate whenever things need to be handled. You have to be clear on what you're dealing with and what's involved in order to move on. If he doesn't come clean about the thing that started it all, then you won't be able to move past it. HE has to give you some satisfaction first.    Best of luck !!|`|Uu8iCur8aa	I dont think you should! If he was treating you badly before and now he thinks he can just get off with it NO WAY! DONT DO IT GIRL|`|lf4Qj1T8aa	Your co-worker was definitely selfish when you didn't give him exactly the right answer he wanted about something so subjective like artwork, and you're right to feel jaded by his sudden desire to kiss and make-up.    Still, everyone makes mistakes. What you need to keep an eye on is whether or not they repeat. If he gets so upset every time you don't read off a cue-card, I think that friendship may be doomed to failure.    In summary: give him another chance, but keep your eyes open for repeat performances.|`|9iNd0Saxaa	tell him that u just havent made up ur mind about his art that u still need time to think...if its been about week yes u should and at the same time give him ur opinion|`|KuGTxZgYaa	you should always forgive anyone    or you will have to worry about it all the time    who would want that?    just get it off you chest and forgive him    you never know you could be doing him a big favor^^|`|ATqWlp8aaa	If you miss this person then the relationship is clearly worth salvaging, however if you have missed them very little or not at all during the course of time that you were not friends, it may not be worth the hassle. Its easier said then done to "forgive and forget" sometimes. Communication is key.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	Well I would forgive him now, but you don't have to talk to him at this time. Of course you're going to need some time to heal.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	some people cant handle the trueth and he is one of them ..he just didnt like your point of view on his work.. and i dont think he was right acting up on u like that.. talk to him  let him know u didnt mean for him to be offened but thought he was opened to an honest opinion and u dont appreciate the way he treated u because of it.. and let him know u just dont feel ok with the whole thing.. good luck|`|nPZi0wzYaa	Hey.....I wouldnt talk to him !!!! He treated you like crap !!! so he does not deserve a friend like you|`|tqb0sQWAaa	So don't pretend to forgive him, honestly and actually forgive him. Talk to him privately about what happened, why you were upset about how he treated you, and what issues you had with his attitude. After you have those things settled, put the events from the past where they belong - IN THE PAST.     And please try to settle this as soon as possible. Unnecessary worry is pointless and shortens your lifespan.    Forgive and forget.    Meg =D
libqzDTPaa	Hey     She should talk openly to him     ask her to go and talk to him    if she cant u should talk to him on behalf of her    iam sure ur frnd is very lucky to have someone like u helping her out|`|zDeFibxzaa	tell her to confront him,ask him what he is scared of,maybe he is hiding something or he loves her too much that he feels he cant be enough for her and dont want to loose her as a friend?seems like he is scared of something or hiding something.|`|tG8matgBaa	I think she should talk to him  maybe you can talk to him and tell him that he needs to take a deep breath and just ask her out.  It's better to talk than to hide feelings, because then there will be no regrets.|`|krZKTxN5aa	let them go on  finally if your friend is a good one he will surely say  'OK  I'll take her|`|Dlbnl7cRaa	dont ask questions like monkey(you).|`|mo5N8tPtaa	I HAVE A IDEA don know if is good but she should try to make him jealouse and to see his reaction ...he'll have to admit coz he'll get scared of loosing her or...she should try to avoid him for a while he may search for her and tell her|`|gQ7HsE0daa	give it some time, don't move on and find out if the guy really likes her and get him to ask her out|`|AA11199891	ok we are ready to help so we need to know who the ppl are and , need to know more ... love is something that should be within and can not be forced...
NHecGoGaaa	There is a special someone for everyone in this world. Don't worry if you cant find someone special for you. Remember, you just got off from a 2 year relationship! Most likely, subconsciously, you're looking for traits on a new guy that remind you of your ex bf which is definitely gonna make it a lot harder for you to find someone you like.     just take it easy for now, don't let your physique bring you down. Most genuine love is NOT based off on looks. if someone likes you, they have to like you for who you are and not how you look.. Of course it helps to be physically attractive, but its not necessary to find true love!.. So don't let your looks bring you down. like you said, you are a nice girl. You definitely have great things to offer to your future significant other.       Good Luck!!..|`|BGTkTNQyaa	I was 24 when I had my first boyfriend. I just never wanted to settle for an @$$hole, and those were the types I kept running into. There were a few nice guys along the way that I met, but they never really wanted to have a relationship with me. Oh, well....so I kept going and focusing on other things and finally, I met the love of my life and we've been married for almost four years now.   As for the world being shallow, yep! There's a lot of stupid out there, and looks do matter to a lot of people. BUT--the good news is that if someone is going to judge you on your looks, you probably wouldn't have enjoyed being with them in the first place.   Don't focus on the thought of being alone forever. You're only 20. So what if Mr. Right doesn't come along for a few years? Use this time to improve yourself, to go places you want to go, and to do things you want to do. Focus on college, or your job. Then, when you get married, you'll have no regrets. Instead, you'll be able to sit there and think to yourself "Yep, I did this and I did that!" Can women who obsess about finding a good man say the same thing about themselves when they settle down? Not saying that's what you're doing...I've had friends who did. Their whole lives centered on finding a man, and that's just not a way to live.  Good luck to you, and know that all will be well. Single women can either be strong or weak....the choice and ability is theirs.|`|cmFU81rQaa	Well, you wouldn't happen to be in Chicagoland, would you?|`|Q3hVrlSpaa	Lol then go out !  go to a club or try lava life.|`|ctjz1Btiaa	I think yahoo personals might be for you. It is just a couple clicks away. Just don't meet anyone in a dark alley.|`|Ah458EfWaa	try online dating. ty it it would b a great shot @ getting a boyfriend|`|DK6kYxmGaa	To start off I'm 22, and been single all of my life. I know how it is though to have all of your friends getting married, siblings gettings married or seriously dating, and it does get fusterating when it seems like you're the only one single.     Some places that I found to have alot of decent guys are: 1. A Christian Church, 2. The Dog Park, 3. Coffee shops, 4. Book stores.    I also tried online dating (several different websites: www.eHarmony.com; www.match.com; www.yahoo.com, www.cupid.com; ect), and none of them really worked out. Alot of them tend to be guys who are really shy,sleazy, or guys who are looking for sex, which I'm not looking for. If you're looking for that, then online dating is a great place to go; because 8 out of 10 times, that's what the men tend to be like.    Good luck. :)|`|qewAfUgJaa	Go out with clubs with your friends. Ask your friends if they know anyone who might make a good couple with you! Try to hang out at open places, like coffee shops, libraries. But when worst comes to worst. Try Eharmony|`|B1RDynGRaa	okay, like my dad always says, you can't be happy married or even in a relationship until your happy single.  thats the key. =]|`|OZNdP0XPaa	I'm 24 with no boyfriend, it's more scary because im not really a people person. i don't go out on clubs so i am stuck with nobody else but my office mates (who are either married or old old). i am now preparing my life for celibacy hahahahha. i guess it's just me. i am very picky ever since i broke up with my ex. seems to me i can't find a better match. i am not that high maintenance but i have begun to set up a standard. i think that is a bad thing.    i guess this would pretty much be similar to you, depressed and lonely and feeling nobody would be around for you. but don't let yourself feel that because everybody else goes through that. enjoy single life but open your eyes, ears all your senses to opportunities. (men) hahahahhaha
ljDeOWwAaa	Don't worry....I know exactly what ur going through...my brother's my Mom's favorite too and she always makes me do stuff that she never makes him do(Chores,etc...) and I've never been in trouble at school either don't you wonder what's up with that? I'm glad to know I'm not the only one...looks like we're both wanting an answer....                          xoxo Kiki|`|B3Cd58ehaa	Your over reacting and no she DOSENT HATE HATE YOU! or youd be living in your grandparents house or your freinds homes!|`|4Hy97dkMaa	maybe shes just jealous .....??|`|WkdW04cNaa	I am sure she doesn't hate you.  You two are probably in a bad cycle right now.  Maybe if you show her some attention and caring, then she will stop and realize what is going on.  Break the cycle and you will see that you are wrong.  Your mom loves you!!!!!
2lMP6ow1aa	No, I think its really sweet and it's a great way to show him that you do care about him. Best relationships start from friendship. Good luck dear! I know how you feel.|`|4m6pumzUaa	That's an AWESOME idea!!! i i got really sick i'd love if my girlfriend cane by and brought me soup and told me she loved me and to get better soon definitely do it! :-)|`|YvpG26Pmaa	I think that it would be a nice idea. It will show him that you care. I wish that I had a girl friend who would do that for me.
QxRKQbt4aa	yes he likes you.  For sure.  Like don't have a second thought anymore.  Signs:    1.  He waits for you after class.  He is waiting so he can spend more time with you and talk with you more.  2.  He moves closer to you.  He does this because his attraction to you is so great he wants to get as close as possible to perhaps touch you but still make it look "natural"  3.  Staring at you.  He finds you incredibly attractive and loves to look at you.  When he realizes that you too are looking at him, his shyness (cause he IS shy ill explain) comes over him and he has to look away.  4.  The voice cracking.  When a guy is nervoous, or SHY, his voice tends to crack, especially at that age.  His nervousness overtakes him and his body naturally does that.    This kid likes you a lot.  But, i am a shy guy myself, and there is NO WAY he will ask you out unless he is 100% sure you like him too.  That is how us shy guys work.  If you want him to ask you out, you better flirt HARDCORE, or find a way to get the word out that you are into him.  Or you can take matters into your own hands and ask him out yourself.  Good luck.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Wait a little, to see if he'll make the first move.  I think he likes you; not positive, though.|`|NPEXTgkXaa	i think he likes you and he is afraid to tell you.    he probably thinks that he is stuck in the friend zone and you dont have feellings for him. he is probably afraid that if he asks you out and you dont have feelings for him then he will lose you as a friend, and he doesn't want that.     so here is what i suggest, start hinting to him that you like him. by flirty. now he might not pick up on that so if it doesn't work after a while just ask him out. he might be too shy to do it. i think that a girl asking a guy out is cool. it shows confidence in a girl.|`|85tAhnM9aa	I would say he definitely digs you but he is crazy nervous. So if you want to be nice and make it easier on him I say go ahead and make the first move.
LKMWuopNaa	if you have a school directory, call his   and say that you were calling you friend and accidentally called him and just keep talking about school or sumthing.  or....    ask him for the homework in... algebra, lets say. or... ask him to tutor you|`|YmLcF2rSaa	Just go to him and ask him out.Be honest and dont commit to anything until you have established a working relationship.Most men would be flattered if they were asked out too.Its not a mans world anymore ita a peoples world.You can do it   I have faith that anything you want you can achieve.and by the way   smile|`|gAflmxDRaa	try and make close friends in certain activities, then if you feel confident, move on from there|`|mGlJbDHtaa	hey, for girls it comes naturally... you have to build your confidence, remember, for every guy that says no its their loss.... go up to the guy you like and start a random conversation.|`|c9e83377d7336eed482d84b85be3bf55aa	have a friend get his email make yourself a NEW email and send him "love" notes...give him details on who you might be and then tell him at one point.....be yourself around him.....love comes slowly and not that easy...just chill and relax...it will come to you!!|`|b0tyT3ebaa	i am the same way. im wicked shy to and cant fllirt. i havnt dated a guy in 3 years. im lonely to. ughhh i dont know why some of us are like that. but my friends always say to me "what do you got to loose" i always say i dont know. but maybe we should just try. add me to your contacts list (:|`|fkiuFr63aa	Well do you have this one special guy to ask?? If so just go for it i mean it sounds like youve got nothing to loose cmon
c3DoNzL1aa	well obviously the flirting isn't working, and if he hasn't asked you out, than hes probably not that into you. i am sorry, but somtimes you have to stop dreaming and get back to reality. I am sure that you deserve better, and can find better. There is someone out there, that you wont have to MAKE like you, it will come naturally. and if you like him back, then he will ask you out, but i wouldn't waist your time on someone, that might not even be worth it!!!
yZzYcxQyaa	Alls I can say is "rushed". People at that age are always in a rush to get in a relationship for one thing only "reputation". It is only when high school comes is when it gets more and more serious.|`|UaZmYXJeaa	11... thats like what 4th or 5th grade. my sister is in that grade and honestly there is no way i can picture them doing mature things. im sure they'll just be like oh yay youre my bf/gf heres my pudding. or they'll hang out by the slide or swings or play 4square together or hang by the monkeybar.....    yup good times back then for me :D  Good clean fun... back then =X
nYBmnt3Caa	wow, first of all, you don't go to yahoo answers for this. second, well i haven't really thought of another thing to say so um yeah, don't go to yahoo answers, just tell your parents, and if she hits you hit her back. make sure she hits you first though.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	How old are you?  Seriously.  You all need to go to time out and then talk to your parents.|`|kdN0iRdtaa	WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! ok so ur sis is 8 yrs older she knows better is she stressed or somthin or is she on drugs???????? i know this dosent help but u can try talkin to her by asking if she is stressed or if someing u did upset her. hope i helped kinda!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NOzMOJseaa	If she really hit you, and kept going you should bring your parents into it...  if you don't want to to do that you can go back to her when she has cooled off and talk to her calmly     And 8yrs older then you??? that's NOT ok!! She def. knows better.|`|w4ZPcamlaa	Yer u should bring your parents into it she shouldn't hit u.
rYdEVC0xaa	I went through the same exact thing, the main thing is to deal with the fact that most of the things that get on your nerves, are too little to even mention. there is no point bickering about fickle things that have no huge meaning in the first place. I finally got fed up of 14 years fighting with my brother over who won this video game, or who's turn it was to do the dishes, even who got to choose the movie we watched, I hated be so angry over nothing, so i just said, lets stop fighting already, it took a couple months to finally dissipate, but the point is its over.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	why wont yu try and be out of your bezzy mood when your by them. and uhm be nice to them. and try to have fun.. i have 4 and they get on my nerves but i really love dem to death. their my world without them i dont know what i would do and maybe you shuld think about that..instead of the negative side...keep your head up..!

916gtqBuaa	youre over thinking it?  when guys ask girls what do you think of me or do you like me it kinda ruins conversations. maybe she just wants a friend and nothing serious right now. or she could be tryin to flirt with you and you shut her down by not giving her a flirt or a cute hey whats up in return.     talk to her as a friend and then flirt and hang out. see where things go but dont move things to fast. JUST HAVE FUN!!!!!    good luck and take it easy dont think about it to much

No man or no WOMAN is worth destroying friendships, Plus you didn't do anything. You are a middle person. You should'nt HAVE TO choose between your friends sweetie.    If they break off thier friendship, thats thier immaturity. It seems "Lexi" is the most immature.    The only thing you can do is tell them you ARE NOT & WILL NOT choose between them.    If they want you too..tell the both off them to p iss off.    Friends ... real friends will not make you choose.    && tell Tj..to go check himself... I bet he aint all that of a playa he thinks he is. ;)    Good luck hunnie :)    **Thinks the 3 Musketeers solved their own issues...Hope You girlsl Work it out ;)**    I don't even know this dude but ..screw Tj..    New name: TJ aint get no BJ|`|W6uHaI1kaa	I totally think that you should go with lexis because she seems like a better friend. its not like she was the one who told tj to ask her to come out to kiss her. its kinda manis fault that she got involved, and told tj. lexis should be the one who is saying sorry, hes not mani's boyfriend anymore- she doesn't have control anymore. you should also tell lexis to back off of tj because he seems like a really bad boyfriend, and since he was about to cheat on his girlfriend, how do you know that if lexis went with him that he wouldn't do that to her.
AA12290249	=/ that's unfortunate. i hate it when people are dumb like that.    i have the same issue when it comes to hanging out and stuff though. you just need to do what i do, find new people to talk to/hang out with. if you're at college, that shouldn't be too hard.    being asian is pretty :) i'm half asian lol.     don't worry abuot not having a boyfriend, he'll come. that's not what everything is about anyway.    confidence is the key. good luck|`|zDeFibxzaa	maybe you just need to get out and go places,if it is just to the grocery store or the mall or whatever you like,im sure you will find someone,probably in places you would never expect or when you are least expecting it to happen.maybe you are looking in all the wrong places?being asian doesnt matter,in fact most guys,me included think they are hot;)did i make you smile?hope so.  you will find what you seek one day im sure|`|A2u06IS1aa	I think its becuase you havta make the first move. Or it might be because.. well are you selfish/snobby/ or nething like that? Or do you flirt with people? Thats the main key to showing that you like someone. I think you should ask a guy out. Its not that bad!|`|j1fUNvmFaa	Well it sounds like me and you are on the same level. I've asked my self the same question: Why do I feel so alone when I know I can have a long, healthy relationship? But I don't have an answer. Most of my friends are "too busy" to hang out as well, but I do have about 1 or 2 that I can still count on. Don't worry, some one will come by eventually. And Asians are hott ;]|`|nsGBwXCTaa	maybe you think of them being your friend . They are proble the people that you think are nice I think you should find you some new friend and see where that gets you ,|`|swJuTXcSaa	Good things come to those who wait. have patience.l.o.l|`|UTGDIOsOaa	dont let ppl critasize u there not ur real friends and 1 day that spical someone will come along and want to be with u just have to wait
yIHlvPFfaa	oh i do, im just like ugh okay so i just put cute with a smiley, lol i also hate when people are like comment my pictures and ill return the favor, like why cant they go comment someone elses picture and then have them comment back, its easier than waiting around, lol and when people post bulletins with the headings "so i love...." and then you open it and it says something like "hot chocolate with whipped cream on top." lol|`|hypmxRlJaa	When you say pc4pc, it means you are willing to comment back whoever comments your picture...|`|c3DoNzL1aa	OH i no that happens to me all the time!!!! and it really bugs me when you don't even know them and they like try to know what is going on but they have no clue, cuz ya you don't even know them!!! and then its like why are u commenting on my photo!!! and one time this kid that was like this tootttal nerd, started commenting on ALLLLLL of my photos, like litterally all of them so i just put in the last one, please stop commenting, if you want to tell me somthing then just like write on my profile!!! it was very annoying|`|I1z8kZD6aa	OMG I hate it. My friend does it ALL the time, and most of the time she will comment the pics of HERSELF on my profile and then say pc4pc, so i just ignore it. And she even comments some of my pics which saying things like don't edit your photos, just be yourself and at the end: pc4pc! LIKE WTF!      haha
ks2oieV0aa	This will not get better, it will only get worse as time passes by.  Move on, don't waste anymore time in this relationship.  xox|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Your welcome. (In advance)|`|XzLUA7ataa	Indeed it is verbal abuse and why do you feel you need that?  Do some reading about what to expect in a healthy relationship.  Give yourself some time apart from this person and you may find that your stress level begins to lift.|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	LEAVE THE ASSHOLE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       I AM IN AN AWFUL, AWFUL MARRIAGE WHERE I GET YELLED AT AND BELITTLED EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  In fact, I am getting yelled at right now...PLEASE do me a favor and RUN LIKE HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    SAVE YOURSELF!|`|AA11383443	Name calling like that is not ok, I've been married almost 18 years and never called my wife names like that, That's because I respect her and love her. If he really cared for you he would treat you better. You really deserve better, and second a fair way to fight is to.  1) no name calling  2) do not bring up the past  3) no hitting  4) never go to bed mad|`|xMpV7sJiaa	Wow okay, so yeah i have been in a way similar situation. i have been called every name you could think of, and it never got better for me, it just got to the point to where i was numb to, to the point where it didn't even bother me... and i thought that maybe it was a good thing that i was no longer effected by his "ignorance". But one night i actually thought about how i felt... we got in a fight and he left we were both so mad at each other that then i realized i was no longer in love with him and he was no longer in love with me. Everything was finally clear, i saw past all the abuse (verbal) I realized that i didn't need to be treated like that, and that i was no longer going to stand for it. I left, honestly it was the hardest thing in the world im only 19 and i have been with the same guy for 4 years... i didn't think i could do it, we lived together and everyhting we owned it was both of ours.... but all i can really say is be strong!!! you can do it, you will find someone else...someone better and you Will realize what happy really is...
YfwTblzKaa	I think you should take the chance and ask her if she wants to do something. If she talked about thinking about you that's big. I only think about guys I still have feelings for although she could be different I'm almost 100% sure. The weight gain thing isn't an issue, yes people will fight me on that but if your good to her she wont care. Best of luck with her!!
gmefdkZsaa	she probally like u, who doesnt like funny guys?|`|dKxrbUQZaa	They might. It depends on the girl, this is one of those questions that will be hard to answer unless you know the person. But I sometimes do, it depends on if you think you have a chance. Even if you talk with her and stuff, she could be afraid of overreacting, and emmbarresing herself by thinking you like her when you really don't. but don't forget that she could just not like you. You should come up with some other ways to find out if she likes you. ex: body language, blushing... ect.|`|OZdfouWlaa	She probably likes you as a friend. and she probably  thinks you're funny.|`|NXJDsVfNaa	if she is laughing at you, maybe she just thinks you are funny?? idk i think she is just confused.|`|PhBAJtkVaa	uh she probably likes you as a friend but if she's not flirting with you then she probably doesn't like you..|`|tD0nI64xaa	Well if she's laughing, that's a good sign! She might me be to shy to admit her feelings for you. But i think that there's a fair chance she might. I'll try dropping a few hints.
dRq6LiXEaa	Um, no you can't really sit there and say that anyone that's immature is gonna be a girl.  It goes both ways, it all just depends on the PERSON.|`|wIoG2KV2aa	You have 1/2 of a point here. It is a common stereotype that men are immature (in my personal experience, I would say that is true about 50% of the time). It is often overlooked though, that women are VERY petty. Again, it is a stereotype, and I would say it is an even higher % than the men are immature (petty women = 70% IMHO), but how can you compare immature and petty? They are quite different attributes.     Immature with your responsibilities can be much more of a concern than a women being petty about a 'look' another woman gave her.|`|NUvu9vMDaa	both ways in different aspects.|`|QNSmbmJvaa	Actually women mature wayyy faster than men so in that case you are wrong.  CASE CLOSED HAHAHA|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	I believe its 50/50|`|zKc66WSXaa	I don't think it depends on gender. People are immature, no matter what gender! But yes, many girls are very immature.|`|9e1a0e459c90e3a8eb8741a8fb042e12aa	Both are immature at times.|`|zc82Q0KRaa	I agree.  Men are actually PIGS|`|VVcfs0IXaa	no its u men. face the true facts in life|`|rd5468H1aa	Yeah, I  agree. Women are constantly stereotyping men into some category, which is so immature. It's not like we do that.|`|6Apou72oaa	Sexist!  There is no either/or.  Some women are immature and so are some men.  Given your question, I think you are one of the immature men.|`|xnsCBJfAaa	In some cases yes we are the foolish ones, But in alot of cases so are you guys... Women do mature faster than guys.. But just cuz your mature doesn't mean you don't have a childish side.. Whats wrong with being playful?|`|dMZEnWPnaa	we are childish and immature most of the time, but girls are a mystery that can never be understood !|`|AA12354369	I agree that YOU are childish and immature.  You're an a$$hole.  YES, lots of full grown men are very childish and immature.  YES, lots of fullgrown women are childish and immature.  and NO, none of them like to admit it.  But there are just as many or more, from both genders, who act and think adult and mature.  Its people like you that give us mature guys bad names.|`|g59U5kwUaa	hey !!|`|s4k29qKPaa	how can u think that!!!??? it is in mens genes that they can be childish and immature.  u r so mean!!!|`|eZQikAY9aa	Perhaps it is a person by person thing......some of each.|`|p2gQgr8taa	I really hate it when girls call guys pigs or say no guys can be trusted, because alot can, i think thats really immature. But still guys are immature at times too. Its 50/50.
vkeuaEHiaa	Yeah, he likes you. Pay more attention and see if he does anything else like that.|`|2glaTP15aa	i think you're just overreacting, but it never hurts to hope right?|`|mR6n0jgFaa	was it a mena tone or good|`|SQyVBEIwaa	A little insight like that doesn't mean he likes you definately, you need to actually have some more sort of conversation to figure that out.|`|CoTsKzPFaa	wtf?!?!? that is no sign!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bG8mEUHhaa	he jus flirted with at dat moment, it dosent mean dat ha likes you.|`|sjMSZpkpaa	Don't look too much into it. It's a good sign, but you don't want to overreach. Hope this helps!!|`|rSXRBEaCaa	saying that could mean a lot of things...but its something...definitely find out his interests and talked to him more...lol you will be fine!!    good luck girly!!    -Pink Magnolia|`|XExUVo0Uaa	ask him for his number and if its okay to text him. Then text him "I think you are hot!"  That should do the trick.|`|Q8QQpKPUaa	I am really sorry, but I do not think it's a sign he likes you... I mean he might, but this incident is not something that can help you make this assumption. So, is he trying to find ways to come close to you? Is he teasing you(in a good way)? Are you the one he asks about what's going on in class? Does he text you often? These are some of the questions you need to answer. But still, he might not wanna show his feelings. I am telling you, though, that if he likes you you are going to be able to say it for sure. You can always feel the vibes of someone who likes you. So, just try to get closer to him and see his reactions.|`|eZJQBVx4aa	oh my god u scared me..  u know y?  cause this is what my boyfriend does to friends too  girl grow up !
AA12290249	nice guys might end last (if you want to think of it that way.) but they always end up the happiest. trust me.     well, bad boys may get a girl for a one night stand, but that doesn't mean that the guy is happy or that the girl will stay with him. once again, nice is the way to go.    nice men are always more attractive just from the fact that they are nice. but if they have no confidence and act like a girl, get mad about every little thing, over react about everything, and just can't take care of themselves, then no they become unattractive almost immediately, if not sooner.    when a guy is mean, it's okay i guess cause everyone is mean once in awhile. if he's mean all the time, then he's out of the picture. if he's rude, smells bad, then he's completely unattractive. if you smell, please, why can't you just work on smelling good? ha ha. (not saying you do personally.)     if they are obese, then i'd be a little hesitant, not because of their personality or anything, but they really need to be able to take care of themselves before they can take care of anyone else. and in all honestly, obesity is not attractive at all. stop being like every other american!     if their shoes aren't clean, i wouldn't really care. it's a pair of shoes, they are supposed to get dirty.     uhm yes that's my opinion. i look for an honest guy, but not honest in a rude way. just a helpful way. a guy who works hard and is caring.  yepp.. but no one is perfect haha.|`|SFWyiZyMaa	I like intellectual men who aren't conventionally attractive.  I find the mind is more beautiful than the image.    But I do admit I like glasses and men that are pleasent.|`|7AFLaiYjaa	Personality  Can make me laugh  Cute Smile and Eyes  Honesty and Trust  A general all around good person.

Clean hands.  clean teeth.  clean clothes, pressed and well groomed.  Clean everything!  He must be able to talk without using any cuss words.

4qpA27dTaa	I believe that you do have every right to feel, in the least, upset. I know how you feel, and dealing with anyone like this can be very overwhelming.  Clingy friends are clingy friends - they have you, and only you, and they just don't want to lose you to anyone else. She is definitely worried that one day you will leave and never come back to her, or that she will become much less important than your other friends. (Your friends may say that she is depressed, but, if you can, you may want to get her side of what's really going on.) She might just be the type of girl that takes a while to make friends, and once she does, she'll be less afraid of losing you. She could be the skeptical type - the type of friend that wonders where you're at most of the time and emails, IMs, or calls you just to ask you where you are. Or she could just be a bit of a curious one - she likes to know a lot about people over a long period of time before she can fully trust them. And that's perfectly okay. I know that it does seem to you that she thinks that you don't care about her, and I know that it gets very annoying after some time.  What you should think about doing is have her over to your house and do some of your regular things and activities, then, out of the blue, just talk with her and tell her how much you care about her and that you'll always be there. Ask her if she really thinks that you ignore her, or if there is really a totally different reason. Also, if she really believes that you like your other friends way more than her, maybe you need to schedule more plans with her than them.  When worst come to worst, and when you just can't handle the pressure, just sit in a quiet place and think to the good times you've had with her, what she does for you, and how happy she is when you're around her. Like I said, she probably just says those offensive things to you and acts like you don't care for her because she is utterly afraid that you will leave and go off with your other friends. You know you won't, so whenever you're with her, express that as much as possible.  Or, if you feel that you can't be with her so much, try introducing her to other people you know, like cousins and sports teammates, or just try to get her involved in clubs or sports of her own for things that she likes. Try to take her and your own mind off of all this by balancing out time in sports and hobbies with time with each other and your other friends. Don't make yourself believe that anything in your life is being ruined, or feel sad about this. Simply make the best of it and just know that this is not your fault.  It's okay - she may just need some time to think about what she's doing... If she doesn't change, maybe you should consider slowly dropping her as a "best friend," and letting her politely down into just a friend.    I hope this helped, and keep your chin up!|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Please, please, please do not beat yourself up on this.  Your friend and her parents need counseling. They definitely have issues.  Do not allow them to make you feel guilty because they have problems with socializing and making and keeping friends.  You guys have been very close and your friends knows exactly what buttons to push to activate your guilt feelings.  DON'T FALL FOR IT!  You have nothing to be guilty about.  You've been nothing but a GOOD friend.  Sit your friend down and give her a good talking too.  If her and her parents don't like it or don't understand, oh well!   Just know that you did all that you could and go on about your life with a clear conscience.  Hopefully they will all come around in time and being the person that you seem to be you will always be her friend.  Good Luck!|`|CEMhkRxuaa	Tell her that you have other friends but you will still be friends with her. Also tell her to back off a bit & that she is over-reacting!|`|mGlJbDHtaa	Friends come and go, my dad says by the time your around his age most of your friends move on anyway, you are left with a small circle of friends you can always rely on, this friend of yours seems to have paved her way out the door, just tell her its not working out and move on, she will find other friends and so will you. Life goes on. You have every right to be angry, upset, frustrated and any other feeling you have, but as time goes by she will realise her mistakes, either she will change (which i highly doubt) or she will move on. Its impossible to hate a best friend, but its always possible to feel hatred at the situation and what they are doing. The question is, does she offer the same friendship as she did from day one, with compassion, sharing, love, conversations etc as you once did as friends? If that is not there any more there is no friendship, just mere acquaintances. Hope it helps...|`|3g8VKsDpaa	You're right; your friend is really clingy. The fact that she hasn't made any other friends other than you in the past TEN YEARS really leaves something to be desired. But why doesnt she make other friends? Is there something about her people don't like? First, tell your friend that you have been trying to stick by her side for a long time, but that she is not your only friend and she can't get all the attention all the time. Next, you can try helping her make new friends or improve some of her quirks. Maybe she'll make new friends if she joins a club. From there, she'll have some new friends, and she won't feel so lonely. Good luck!        Nicoleta?
cv5PYXEIaa	1st you need to tell him EXACTLY how you feel.   As of stopping the sex, that's not bad. That's what he deserves. I think that you should go with your heart. If you truly love him then try to work it out. But if you feel like you just can't deal with it anymore then leave. Or maybe you just need to get away for the weekend. Have some "me" time and think about things.    Good luck.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	I was married 43 years and he did cheat on me(several times) but you know what it really doesn't matter you can get through it. Men seem to think they should at least try it once.  In my experience that area never wears out.  What is important is that the other one was disease free and that it did not represent a true threat to the family.  One night stands usually donot pose a threat to the family. After one night stands if he returns to the home, provides, and makes you and the children happy there has been nothing terribly lost.  It is when he leaves his family and ignores his responsibilities that there is a big problem.|`|lf4Qj1T8aa	What he did to you is really horrible, sweetie, and the pain that you feel won't go away for a while. You really should seek counseling for this; a licensed therapist will help you decide whether or not to move on, and how to learn to forgive him if you choose to stay together.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	it seems u love him and consueling might help.. he did wrong and he made a mistake..i am not saying it was right i dont approve of cheating... but try talking to him and try to work it out.. but what ever u do.. good luck|`|vZWtkK9Naa	I have seen you ask this question so many times!! You should stay and try to work things out, couples therapy!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Trust if everything in a relationship without that it won't work.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I would recommend counseling for the two of you. If he does not want to go then maybe you could go alone. It is a bad sign that he would cheat on you after only 5 months of marriage. You should be in your honeymoon phase where everything is rosy. I hope things work out for you.|`|ohi0kM6Raa	woman, there are much worse things in life that he could have done.      make it simple, if getting the divorce was easy as pie would you do it?|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	I am sorry he did this to you.The pain will go away but you will never forget he did this and it will be hard to totally trust him.You might want to consider counseling and see if this works.It has to be up to you if you want to give him another chance to prove to you that he can be faithful.I wish you the best of luck.
9JFnkCMfaa	Yes, absolutely... Girls tend to giggle and turn away (not to mention turn red) to mask being shy... ;)|`|MyuexdrYaa	most of the girls i have hooked up with giggle. Making out sometimes makes a awkward situations. when people are in these situations they tend to react differently. Some girls choose to react by laughing.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Maybe very young girls do this, but most don't. If a girl still giggles when she's making out, she's probably too young to be making out.|`|otgVDMaHaa	it feels good not tickles|`|GmTMVmASaa	no, but depending on her age, she may be embarassed.|`|e12bf810e79d242a64e4502e588dc9ecaa	Not really lol|`|aRBF37Qpaa	i've never made out lol and i'm a girl, i'd probably giggle but i'm always happy so i always giggle, hehe *giggles* lol haha, so yea i am guessing it's normal      shouldi be concerned this is in the family section??|`|X8yIFdwuaa	ummmm, yeah, its pretty normal its a sign of happiness and/or embarassment|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	ONLY DUMB GIRLS|`|CfD1bRNtaa	If a girl is new to making out, she may giggle because she's not used to it, and it's kind of awkward, other than that, I've got nothing.|`|CTIC7Pmjaa	She's probably just nervous.  Don't let it psyche you out.|`|JADINzKtaa	Depends on the girl i guess. does it bug u?|`|DYm8rPpyaa	Lydia are you a he or she?  if your a he shes just nervous  if your a she she just feels naughty|`|aKDsbpwAaa	yeah it is normal for a girl to giigle after making out but its not normal to giggle while making out if thats what u mean|`|lnPIJELNaa	never happened to me, but i guess it could be. thats kinda weird and funny though|`|nchbC7uTaa	dont know|`|mDTkpuiuaa	you tell me lydia|`|2Y5rSTRZaa	How is this a family question?!?!?|`|aa013e9a2443a8c713e9debdef2ba157aa	Yes, it is new for them and when you get nervous you laugh.
m9L8oOIAaa	wow.. if ur a friend that do that then i don't want  u as a friend, because a good friend  is a person that got ur back when u fall and don't lie to eachother... always treat someone like u would like to be treated. would u like  it if someone u love so much  and u was in a on  and off relationship and ur friend sneak around with that person that u love. Nope i don't think so. Love is on and off sometime , but don't think for one  second that the fire is not burning. for u to get in the picture is call a enemy. a cat fight for one man. I always tell people this. if  its a girl theres planty more dog in the leash if its a guy theres planty of fish in the sea. i'm pretty sure ur going to catch one.lol Remember this love is every hard to find. think with ur head not with  the other one. u know the sing|`|ENspyhzUaa	some friend you are sneaking behind her back to date someone she might still have feelings for? i'm sure jealous i don't have you as a friend =="|`|d7OswsvMaa	yea..dont do it babe..find sum1 else..|`|d2zGNPUoaa	not a good idea if she is really your best friend|`|HyKUT9F8aa	nope, don't do it you might lose a friend if she really likes him.|`|KY7ZSe8Xaa	You should talk to your friend first.Its better if you tell her than sneaking behind her back.Imagine if she were to find out, ya'll are supposed to be BEST FRIENDS.|`|kNdVqq0Daa	simple rule that helps in all situations.    if you ever dated someone, a real friend would never date them or sleep with them.    thus, if your friend slept with or dated someone, dont even think about it.    saves alot of unneeded drama from happening.  there are plenty of people in this world, no need to overstep that simple rule

tG8matgBaa	that happened to my when my boyfriend started kissing me too. It can get overwhelming. It's good he understand and respects you. Just try to take it a little slower. ask him to be a little more gentle and talk to you. It helped me when he would take a break and talk to me. I guess it made me feel like he didn't forget about me and was so wrapped up in kissing.|`|c5945tSvaa	O MY GOD!     lord help u!   who the hell freaks out when they are gonna make out! not even the 1st kiss loser!     ur 15 common! he is 16 he has more experiance than u .. dont u feel dumb?? hahah  \  in a scale of how good i kiss between 1-10 im  a 20 ur a 0!!!!    ur boyfriend is prob gonna leave u fast , imagine when he trys to to more than a "makout" ur gonna be blowning up questions on yahoo.! ! jajajaj    dont worry ill b here 2 advice u!     tell your mom that the meeting is canceled tomorrow. thanks sweety !|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well you were caught off guard. But next time you should tell him that you have never made out with a guy before. Tell him you want to but you just are new to it. So just relax and try a breathing technique. Just inhale, and say "I am" and exhale and say "relaxed." (this also works for cramps and when I was afraid to get on a roller coaster). This will keep you calm and your mind on something else. (Think about something else by the way when you do this, I forgot to mention this in the beginning, I think about my lungs inflating and deflating so I can think about something else.)
W6uHaI1kaa	Omg  if you really want to help him then tell an adult.

I'll meet you there.|`|ncyggpFOaa	dude why would you let him??? contact someone like NOW|`|MIEGzslNaa	First off, don'tt insult someone who's about to kill himself. People believe what they hear about them, and take it personally sometimes. Your friend would most likely agree that he is, indeed, an asshole. but what that does to you is puts you in jeopardy to be the reason he wants to kill himself.    anyways, if you're still following what i mean, taking time to talk and let that person know that people care about him will help. Ask what he needs, what he feels like, don't threaten to bring his parents into it oranythingg like that. NO threats. itdoesn'tt help, just makes it worse.    Also, if your the only one who knows about his attempts of suicide, try to get some more friends that are close to him and you as well, so you should all get with him to celebrate him, just let him know that he is cared about. That people love him, and that there is a reason he's there.     I hope your friend does not go through with suicide, let him know there is more to life than what it seems. I know what he's going through, and i've survived to find that life is beautiful, no matter how sucky it seems sometimes.|`|OS5RuMK1aa	no of course you shouldn't i have a friend like that and just talk to him and find out why he wants to kill himself|`|AA11709855	Kick him in the balls to show him he's alive.|`|rgqDS5VKaa	I can't believe you even have to ask!! What kind of friend are you???|`|8vIFr5Asaa	get professional help! this is serious, and i think it takes more than yahoo answers can fix this. go 2 a coucler or something.|`|yn0auQB5aa	you should never let anyone die intentionally? talk to him,make jokes, make him feel good and realize what he would miss out on =[|`|MiBa1ZILaa	No you definitely shouldn't let him just kill himself!  Even if he complains about his life, some thing might just be wrong. Figure out what is wrong and try to talk to him.|`|aOsMqwbfaa	Depression medication such as; Zoloft, Wellbutrin,Lexapro,Xanax,Effexor,Prozac,... Zyban. Then also try counseling.

mo3SwJfOaa	Hey, I think most of us have been through our first bf/gfs and it's stressful like no other; you're wondering what you should wear, what you should say, what you should do. Just remember that since youre 18, these relationships arent meant to last. Ofcourse you should take it slow, find out what kind of a guy this person really is and hopefully he will turn out to really care about you.    About the lunch part, I think you shouldn't sit with him. It tends to make things awkward for him and his lunch pals.|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Welcome to heartbreak.|`|jB5cMnGFaa	Just be YOU and relax! If it doesn't feel right after time has passed then maybe he isn't a good choice-but as you are new to this, it could just be adjustment to a new experience.  Just don't get ahead of the game and call him your bf just yet--think of it as a date!   If time passes and you still don't feel comfortable with him that will be a good indicator that you and him are not a good match, as you should be having just as much fun with him as you would with your friends!   The first kiss will be awkward-the second one should feel better-if the third one doesn't stir something within you, you don't like him in "that" way! In any case--take the sex part slowly! You don;t mention his age-but if he is more experienced he may try to pressure you-stick to what feels right for you.  Valentine's day after 2 weeks...a cute card? nothing too mushy..maybe a roll of conversation hearts--can't go wrong with candy! They taste great :)   And as horrible as dating and breaking up can be-remember that it is also just as wonderful! And your heart will be broken, and you will break hearts and you will fall in love again and it IS all worth it!!  and as u r 18--make sure you are brushed up on intercourse /safety etc & never feel pressured--  And when dating anyone-if something doesn't feel right to you-DONT DO IT! Whatever IT is!!!   Lots of love to you!!|`|AA12108398	Well just let the first kiss happen and ask him if he would like you to sit with him at lunch.

That is why he likes you. Don't change what you say or do. It really is not any different that what you have already.You could get him something small for Valentine's Day. Maybe a card with a small teddy bear. Nothing too big since you just started dating. The best advice I can give you is to be the same girl you always have been. He likes you so relax and enjoy being together. Don't take the "relationship" so seriously. Just have fun being together and everything will work out.|`|VMEKBGUjaa	I wouldn't get him anything for Valentines Day since the relationship is so new. Just hang out with him on that day if you can, and maybe go somewhere where you can be alone.     You should probably sit with him at lunch, but only if both you and him want to. Are you sitting with him now? And has he said anything about it?    First relationships are always difficult and awkward; just give it time and you'll figure it out.     As far as kissing him, it'll just happen once you both get comfortable around each other.    Good luck =D|`|IuW1t40xaa	you should make him lunch|`|3b260eb1068172303ded7f66fd428631aa	Whatever you do, don't have sex with him for a long time just to see if he really likes and cares about you.

Remember kissing leads into other things, keep your hands to yourself!!!|`|UG2z5rGIaa	wow  kay slow down sweetie    okay kissing thing, first kiss will ALWAYS be awkward so savour the momment and leanr from it    sit with him if you guys want  since the relationship is just new maybe you should get him a little card or maybe just some candy nothing too OMG BIG!!    you cant take advice fomr relationships, its just one of those things that you leanr fomr experiances and figuring out for yourself  its not math class :P    best of luck for you both :D|`|yfHAWXLjaa	yes get him a present for valentines day!  and dont feel weird, ya its ur 1st bf and all, but just relax. and and dont be afraid to kiss him! go for it!!!!!!  but do take things slow. u dont want to get urself into anything u dont want to do.|`|mL07N3IAaa	- if you have a cellphone, don't text people when he's around. it's rude  - don't say i love you unless he says it first  - guys should always pay for movie tickets/dinners/etc.  - valentine's day is the girl's day! don't get him anything..( i dunno why girls have to get the guy chocolate/etc?)  - don't have sex with him unless he proves himself worthy...  - don't do anything you don't want to do with him    hope i helped! and goodluck! =)|`|ec44o5ECaa	Well I think if your not comfortable with this person you shouldn't date him, but you have a lot of time to get to know him so I'm sure you'll start to warm up to him eventually, but if you don't then you shouldn't be with him for sure- I've had boyfriends that I wasn't comfortable with and I figured out that it was just because I was rushing into things.    And as for the kiss, just wait for a good time. It definitely shouldn't be in public since it's your first kiss together and all... That would definitely be akward.    Hope I helped.(:|`|RRTc9FAIaa	well don't freak out too much since it's ur first year aim for something small n don't make it obvious that he is your first valentines maybe a valentines card and even candy trust me u cant go wrong with candy but remember keep it small
2iDvyoXhaa	Why would you have anything to be worried about? Ex's are ex's for a reason. They weren't right for each other. But that doesn't mean she can't keep in touch with them, or even be their friends.    Don't worry until she gives you something to worry about.|`|s8d7gg5Haa	i am sure in this case she just hasn't bothered too delete them   but my ex ages back would still text hes and then left me for her again   but then coming back when he realized what a mistake he made ha ha     just if she texts and meet up with them just look a little more in to it.|`|7VMLssSnaa	No you dont.

You have to understand that, this is what has made up her life, she has the right to keep the memories, information, anything of that sort. When it starts to harm you, or the relationship, that is when you can be as concerned as you want to be.|`|qewAfUgJaa	I think your ok for now, i mean when she starts to go out for coffee with them i would look into it, but alot of girls like to keep in touch with their ex-loves. No worries for now!|`|NOzMOJseaa	the internet is nothing to be worried about its if she starts going out together, or hanging out with them again when you should at least talk to her about it
i6WVPncnaa	She does show signs that she likes you.  If you like her, you should ask her out.  If she thinks that your not interested, she will lose interest in you and move on to the next guy.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.
AA10584967	From a Male perspective, If you dont plan on going out with him or anything try to act like everything is normal. You dont want to make it awkward around you. And Tell chris to stop. If Drake wants to "get at u" he will.|`|bZud91iuaa	So what are you going to do? String him along?  Tell him how you feel and let him off the hook, girl.  The question should not be if you think he's hurt and covering it up, but what should you do to remedy the situation.  I think you like the fact that he thinks he likes you and you want him to hang on to the possibility that there may be a chance for him.  That's pretty selfish....don't you agree.  Do the right thing and tell him you're only interested in his friendship.|`|b3gcMi2Raa	ugh... the momories... i had this exact same situation except  in my case i was drake, my best friend was Chris (drew) and i liked this gurl. Chris either likes you or he jux cant keeps a  secret. if he likes u then he told u that drake likes u to make situtions between u and drake akward, thus making u not like drake. either that or chris jux isnt a good friend. i do thnk hes covering up & if u want to save ur relationship with drake u will tell him how u feel... b4 itz 2 late...|`|e6I2mjvzaa	that's what i would definitely think.|`|KY7ZSe8Xaa	i think he's hurt and covering it up. why dont you talk to him about it and explain why you dont want to date him.
OG3lycSPaa	How about asking her why she is single if you are comfortable asking her that. And then ask if she would go out with you. If she is a good friend she will respect your feelings whether she likes you like that or not.
PhBAJtkVaa	ooops... yeah, she's probably kinda pissed right now|`|d7OswsvMaa	lol..yea rly bad move!..|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Well, yeeeaah.|`|RsnKo6Okaa	That was a bad move on your part.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	aaaaaass!|`|396786e39de6d27bb83a16323b6d33ddaa	uh. YEAH...look just giver her some time and just tell her like it is. you wanted to go with someone else....bad move but you can try to recover. i believe in you. :D|`|QkYRnTPIaa	I think you know that your rejection of her was a bad move.  Guess she wanted to return the favor when she rejected you the second time around.|`|NNTPnhZgaa	It depends.. why did you ask her out?  Did the other girl reject you, so then you asked the first girl out?  I'd probably be pretty offended..|`|6mzHrKw0aa	jus tell her how you feel and that you are TRUELY sorry about what you did :) don't worry.     ANW|`|g59U5kwUaa	omg..why thats mean in a way id be the same right now give it a week or two then try again (:
AA10280709	Excellent piece of writing. As a published author I will say this is a great piece, don't change it just add to it if you want although sometimes short tight writing is more powerful than an abundance. Does your essay have a word limit?
JUXpVYC4aa	LOLOLOL HAHAHAHAHA FISHING FOR YOUR WEANIES LOL|`|QMeForAGaa	ugh ya  thats gross|`|z2SODuR9aa	not break up with him, but speak to him about it and by the way what is breanie weanie soup??? ive never heard of it hehe|`|ATYsN8q1aa	I will never look at beanie weanies the same way ever again.      What you have here is a situation where your boyfriend isn't taking you serious enough.  I've been comfortable with girlfriends to walk around naked, burp in front of, joke about bathroom humor, but leaving your "art" in the toilet for your mate to see is a little far.  Especially after you communicated to him that it really disgusted you.      You need to revisit the conversation with him, in a much more serious tone.  You can even add the "if you don't" addition which you tell him that it's so unattractive that you feel it could lead to you eventually not wanting to live with him.      It's okay to be comfortable with your significant other, but it's never okay not to respect their boundaries.      Hope this helps.
dGL5xCrqaa	Seriously, who looks at the "package" and butt? Not any girl I know, that's for sure.  Looking for the stomach and arms. Guys shouldn't have butts, it should be nonexistant, flat!  Actually, I look at the hair too, and the eyes! I wanna get lost in your eyes, not your black hole butt.|`|sZSGDDcYaa	As much as people say look for personality opposed to physical apperence. Every girl looks for something sexy on their man they have a crush on. Me personally I look for muscular men, the package doesn't matter because if you truly like the person you will be okay with whatever the package contains. :)|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	uniforms as in what?? depends on that...    I rarely look for a nice butt (i cant help myself, i couldnt care though)  all around looks arent that important to me. I would talk to any guy, and they dont have to be the hottest person in the world. Although I do want some physical attraction in a guy. I wouldnt turn him down before knowing him, unless he's a complete perv.|`|xfqHbM3kaa	Doesn't matter who you are..if your in uniform it instantly turns my head.  I don't usually turn those guys down.|`|UfyYRyBmaa	Im attracted to guys in uniform. Usually I look at how big the guy is like chest wise and body wise and then I look at the face, which still does count last I look at the butt. I don't really look at the front for a nice package..I don't think a girl can tell by just looking at their pants lol Most important is still face though...looks wise, a guy's personality always makes the guy shine brighter,|`|S852p6SXaa	i dont care if their in a uniform or not, i still look.|`|7I8gNo9Taa	i honestly don't care about a guys package... now a nice butt on the other hand.... so yeah, i check out the butt|`|0mamF6jxaa	to be perfectly honest, most girls could care less how big a guys 'package' is. i like muscular arms and a six pack|`|5vaBqfDIaa	If you're a gentleman and do the flirty smile thing and show an interest, then you'll make a girl pay attention. If you're a "guy in uniform", your body will probably catch their attention anyway. No one cares about "the package" or "nice butt"...|`|iwvRBeXOaa	Definitely. I don't necessarily stare at their crotch in hopes of seeing a bulge, but I have definitely turned around to check out a cute guys' butt :) Looks do count, but a lot of times women are more into confidence. Women can see and feel confidence almost radiate from a guy based on his posture, eye contact and the overall way he carries himself.    If a guy is surrounded by friends and some are laughing at him or all staring at him it makes a girl go "whoa, what's so special about that guy?" even if he isn't the best looking.    BTW, I have a good guy friend. On a scale of 1-10 I'd honestly say he's a 6. He's in the Navy and wears his uniform out to bars and clubs and he gets more women than you could ever imagine. It's insane what a uniform and some confidence can do.|`|MfkQCMx6aa	I'm not one for uniform, personally...it just doesn't do much for me. Nice fitted clothes, however, are winners everytime :)    I look at the bum, not the "package" though. And i look for a generally lean physic. Not too musclular but looked after, healthy and toned.|`|Q2z5a4Xpaa	lol yes!|`|AA10789032	I dont judge a guy on looks or what they wear. It really is about the confidence and personality. Im attracted to a guy with a great sense of humor and confidence. If a guy Im talking to has a nice personality and happens to be good looking to, then his good looks are just a bonus|`|yjy2Ty3aaa	depends on the uniform if its mall cop than no (lol i just saw that movie). we don't really "look" for anything but yes as shallow as it sounds looks do count but we don't expect perfection. personally i like it when a guy flirts with me first. Be outgoing.
OG3lycSPaa	How about " I fell come rescue me"
oT3d4Yu0aa	Just because your almost 17, doesn't mean you get to go out on those days. As long as you live with your parents, they make the rules. You can make the rules when you move out.|`|WkdW04cNaa	What is a normal highschooler?  I don't know many that go out both nights.  Maybe you could plan some events at your own home and maybe that would make your parents feel more comfortable.  Why don't they want you to go both nights?  I think if you respect your parents and show them that they can trust you, more free time will come.  It's a scary world out there and parents have to be responsible and make important decisions for their children all of the time.  I am sure you know what they worry about.  It's the other people in the world that they worry about.........it doesn't mean they don't trust you.
d9bd1d4468ea0aae2b98e9d6d2b94953aa	The first thing that u should kno is that that was HILARIOUS I JUST LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  neway in all seriousness just go up to ur cousin and keep botherin them to break up with her after a while he'll crack and just break up with her it works for me all the time!!!!!!!!!!!
BVwDoV81aa	Sounds to me like you're a homebird anyhows  so even if you did have the money and time I doubt you'd go... as you say you want to finish uni get a job and a wage.     You've make no allowance anywhere to have a year out or do a sabbatical year as do many European students during studies. Before studies in Europe we often do what is known as a Gap Year.   We kinda do that to get it out our system before the 9-5 career stuff as we realise that youth comes only once and it would be difficult to ask an employer to give us a year off later mid-career or during a traineeship (hard won) to go bumming about the world and could he just keep our job open for us while we were away just in case we wanted it when we came back thanks very much....!    I suggest he goes... and you stay.... both happy.    best wishes

ozwLZwXeaa	I wouldn't read to much into him having the pictures of his ex.  He may be having a bit of nostalgia about his past.  Got that, past.   You are his now, you are his future.        Please don't nag him about it, he will delete the whole thing when he is ready.  My hubby had a large box that was his private stuff.  In that was pictures of old girlfriends, older lovers, his father and the purple heart that belonged to his father.  There were pictures of his ex wife and their children as babies.  Old copies of important papers  of all kinds of things.        My point is, let this go and just love each other today and tomorrow and not worry about things you can not change, anyway as I said, his future is with you as long as you don't become a jealous nag.  Be cool and be happy hon.  Granny
tFC13Xsgaa	confront her|`|eUeTEmCeaa	confront her about it nicely at first|`|PYl3GSQZaa	Don't jump to conclusions immediately, perhaps she had a valid reason for being at the store. simply ask her about it, nicely.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Two choices.....pretend you did not know about her shopping trip and carry on as normal or confront her about it. Choice is yours.|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	bring it up to her, and ask why? you really can't do anything, because some people are just rude like that.|`|W6uHaI1kaa	i think you should go up to her and say ," lsn the other day some one we know saw you at the store when you were supposed to be babysitting. just tell me the truth... you dont have to lie. If you didnt want to sleep over it would have been fine..."  Be nice. :)|`|ybwqYZ1waa	Was she buying groceries for the mother or dinner for the kids? If not, than she's not a true friend. Tell her that your ticked and if she's gonna be that way than she can go find somebody who WILL deal with that crap.  ( IDK what else u should do)|`|uA3yUdCzaa	i'd confront her about it cuz thats not right|`|R5nmJXvraa	I would have to agree with Anthony R.|`|zdO16ELnaa	I HAD FRIENDS LIKE THAT (A**HOLES)  THERE NOT REAL FRIENDS|`|v0Sn3V9Qaa	Tell her that your friend saw her at the store. Don't say it accusingly, just say it.|`|teisU4E2aa	confront her about it if she lied and isn't babysitting shes not your friend|`|IcTnDRC4aa	I know it seems like a huge deal right now, but she probably has an explanation for it. Just ask her about it calmly.   "We just wanted to see what was up because we really wanted to hang out with you."  And if she lies to you about it still, go ahead and tell her you know. Just try to stay come and keep the conversation positive. Also only one person should do it. You don't want to do like 2 on 1 or any thing like that. It will make her think you don't like her, and you all are talking about her.|`|oHeY4Rx8aa	do her hard.|`|kvJwoQmOaa	play, who is first out the 2nd floor window!|`|rgqDS5VKaa	I think you should confront your friend and ask her what really happened.|`|QwvEcTs9aa	I would confront her about it..but be careful not to jump to conclusions.|`|02bNMUxoaa	maybe her parents wouldn't let her and she was too embarrassed to say. i am sure it was a logical explanation|`|MllSCmIraa	Confront her. You shouldn't hide that you know she was there, you're not in the wrong, she is. Confront her and ask why she blew you off.|`|YqQOdkCQaa	just ask her why she lied 2 yeww. be like, hey, some1 saw yeww at the store. sooo why'd u tell me yew were babysitting and not tell me the truth?|`|dGBbFwFWaa	nothing .. she is entitle to change her mind..and maybe thats what happened she just didnt know how to tell u.. and who ever went to you and told on her.. think about that person twice..seems she likes to gossip.. good luck|`|EgGrKWjxaa	be like so how was your babysitting and ask for ALOT of details like what games did you play with  him, how long, ......ect      then confront her  make her feel guilty then say if your gonna lie to me then I dont wanna be friends|`|WqGOaR4Qaa	this question is confusing.  please before you try to figure out a problem learn how to  write a question that makes sense!|`|RxjX1enJaa	Talk to her.|`|Eh6GjKTnaa	always talk to her first.  it might not of been her, or she was getting something for babysitting. Don't blow up and acuse her without knowing the story.|`|JujqGHXjaa	I think that before you do anything like get mad at her, you should at least talk to her first and make sure that she didn't just have to run an errand or something...|`|6azlfmscaa	hm did your friend know why she was at the store, maybe she was buying things for babysitting, or maybe they called her and said they didn't need her help anymore for babysitting but didn't want to call you cause she probably thought it was too late, or simply because she didn't want to go sleepover at your house.  Ask her if she really babysat, and tell her that your friend saw her at the store. if she lies then just ignore it, don't let little things like that get in the way of your happiness.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	I wouldn't really worry about it. How do you know that the person who told you that is telling the truth? There are worse things that could happen than that. If she kept doing that, then I would confront her about it.|`|9IhgFvuLaa	Confront her and ask whats up. Thats not a good thing to do, and if she dosnt see anything wrong, shes not a real friend.|`|P76MLs5caa	Ask her nicely why she did that. If she is a real friend she should have a reason for flaking. Either way, she needs to say sorry and you need to forgive her. Forgive and forget. That is what you should live by. DON'T LISTEN TO THE IDIOTS SAYING THE VIOLENT THINGS!|`|wufY5yXkaa	i'd say let it slide.  she might have anxiety over sleeping at someone else's house.  or maybe she stopped at the store before going to baby sit.  don't be a bunch of little brats about it though.|`|1899lYjMaa	Forget about it, if you value their friendship. Sometimes people don't feel like hanging out.|`|aRHhrsrEaa	just have fun without her.|`|nUmiUNklaa	beat the living crap out of her next time you see her.|`|4KocdJt4aa	Call her up and ask her about it.    If she lied to you, ask her why, and if she dosen't know you should just say something like "Well why did you wait last minute to cancel? We're friends, if you didn't want to hang out, you could have just said something. I would'nt have been angry." This makes them feel terrible.    In the end though, forgive her. Honestly, everyone makes mistakes, and everyone is a jerk at one point. I bet if you call her out on it she will feel bad and apologize. Just forget about it and continue being friends.|`|nPZi0wzYaa	well never beleive what other people say unless you seen her for your self. All yoou have to do is ask the girl if she was at the store or baby sitting !!!!|`|kBVIPCzuaa	Welll.....  maybe you should call your friend and ask her why she didnt want to come over. If she was at the store...then maybe she was picking up something for her babysitting job.   But before you get all upset and stuff...maybe you should take into consideration why she didnt sleep over. Idk...maybe she needs the extra cash or something. Just call her up and be like "Soooo...are you sure you dont want to sleep overr??? Maybe you could come after you finish babysitting." I'm pretty sure that if she's not lying to you about where she is....she'll want to come after she babysits. And if she says no....just be like "Why dont you wanna come...you said you would. And btw...someone just told me that you werent even babysitting... What up with that???" Just play it cool and act natural. And dont get all worked up over what is probably nothing.
WkdW04cNaa	For one thing, I totally understand what is happening in your life and I know how hard this is.  It doesn't mean that you don't belong with your mom.  You may need to talk to her privately about what is happening with your stepfather and how you feel.  Your mom may not know what is happening.  I know it sounds cool to live with your friend but when it comes right down to it, it isn't the answer for you.  You will probably feel more out of place there than with your mom.  You need love and support at your age and your mom needs to know it.  She is caught up in some things now and she just needs you to bring this to her attention.  Talk to her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|hQsvuxs3aa	call child services and tell them about your step dad and ask if they can get you to live with your friend/|`|okh3hL8taa	Who is going to support you if you move in with your friend's family?  As for you getting a job...I doubt that, have you checked out the news lately?  Knowing someone for a long time and trusting them doesn't mean they are going to support your children for you.  It coses money to feed and clothe kids...|`|JbqcXcVpaa	Wow -.- Private Training Hehehehe... No Joke Now  Tell Her You Are Stressed And Let You Have Your Own Freedom.
tFC13Xsgaa	well im a guy and i would want you to tell me how u feel
diQ0oodqaa	Don't understand your last line, why should you have to just let him go and just have a relationship with his sister? I don't know how you just let your son go.    Do you think he wants on this medicine? Or is his mother in control and it's her wishes to keep him on Adderall? I had a good friend who kept her son on it because he was "easier to deal with" when he was medicated.    I would talk to a doctor, a lawyer, a child psychologist--someone and get a professional opinon, there may be a legal way to make them take him off this medication.|`|4ssSgfYEaa	The Dr. must think he needs them, or he/she wouldn't prescribe them.  If he is ADHD or ADD, then it is not unusual to have a prescription to help with the Attention Deficit so he can study.    This is a child who is caught in the middle.  You can't throw him to the side because he has a problem.  That would be terrible neglect, and could mess his Psyche.|`|08d1e5233f3b30ec082c65faefd9a480aa	Are you serious?  I can't believe what I'm reading.  Would you actually consider not having a relationship with this young boy because of the choices he makes?  The choice to take a medication that helps him with a serious problem!  If Adderall helps him maintain his straight A's then what is the problem?  Why are you soo against him taking it?  Maybe instead of judging him you could accept that he has ADHD and support him with whatever kinds of treatment he chooses!!!!  If you both love him then show him.  If hes been hiding it from you for a year how do you think that makes him feel?  Seems to me you guys are his problem not the Adderall.  Wouldn't surprise me if this kid end up with some kind of mental problems or depression from you guys making him feel like ****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    EDIT: You need to learn how to write!!  How did his mom put him back on the Adderall??  No matter if its prescribed to him or NOT it's still sick that you would just "let him go and just have a relationship with his younger sister."  Don't you think that he would still need his fathers love and support?  Whats your problem lady? Hes not even your kid so maybe you should just STAY OUY OF IT!|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Wait - how is he your son if his mother put him on Adderall and you're not his mother...?  Should you send him home?  Why do you have him?  Your question is too poorly worded to really understand.|`|okh3hL8taa	You say that you just found out that your son's mother put him on Adderall, frankly I don't understand that  a child can only have TWO parents to begin with so if you are not married to your son's mother then that SHOULD read "I just found out that my 14 year old's mother put him back on Adderall".    If he doesn't live with you then whatever issues come up are for his mother to be the ultimate judge of and if she feels this is the right thing to do then she has final say.  If you are married his step mother really has no voice in this decision, it is between you and the boy's mother.  As far as having a relationship with his younger sister...What do you mean by relationship?  Your entire issue is very convoluted and hard to understand.  Maybe you should try putting it into english.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You said he's old enough to have an opinion, and that he's been concealing taking the meds. That means his opinion is he wants to take the meds!    Why don't you and his dad accept him as he is, with a medical problem that benefits from medication. I can not even COMPREHEND that you would cut off your husband's child (not yours, obviously) over his decision to take medicine. If he were diabetic, you'd probably withhold insulin. You and your husband are really the sick ones. This disgusts me.    EDIT: Adderall is a stimulant, not a narcotic. Is he buying it on the street? If a doctor is giving it to him, they think he needs it, because it's a scheduled drug and not handed out like candy. No one knew he was abusing it because you called them meds not drugs and didn't say so. Frankly, your ability to communicate is so poor that it's nearly impossible to understand WHAT you're talking about. Maybe you ought to see if your step-son will share his drugs with you.
Q8QQpKPUaa	oh dear girl... I'm 18and although i've been with my boyfriend for quite long, he has strong feelings for me, we're really close to each other and sometimes passion gets out of control, I feel EMBARRASSED for wanting to have sex, because I consider myself too young. I remember when I was 13 and I knew what sex was, I found it disgusting, lol  So, anyway, you might not want to have sex, but just be asking about it... First of all you should be fully informed about contraception and the consequences that might occure after having sex. Secondly you need to love the person you are with and make sure he loves you too(sth hard to tell). Then, it just comes out naturally, when you're so close to each other that you are not afraid of anything anymore :)  But let me say again you're too young if you wanna do it,  I cannot imagine my 10 year old sister having sex in 3 years, omG|`|3b260eb1068172303ded7f66fd428631aa	Sex is suppose to be between two people who love and care about each other. I must say that you are a bit young and to be honest most are having sex early at 13, but I promise you will regret it  and wished you had waited to be with someone that you love and want to be with. When the time is right then you may experience and of course with a condom. But I truely think with as bad it with AIDS and HIV  and other STD these days you should be terrified to have sex this young. Plus also having babies young is hard , I know I have three beautiful children but I am happily married with the children's father. Continue to Love yourself and keep a lock on it and keep the key place  far away and no matter what that boy tells you, you tell NO that you are going to wait till you are older!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|fk3TFlTlaa	LMFAO.

It's not something you should rush.  enjoy things the way they're supposed to be at your age.  Don't ruin all the new discoveries of your teens your first year into them!    EDIT : Also you weren't joking, and you know it.  Don't be ashamed.  You should never be ashamed to wonder about things.  and it's better to ask in an environment like this than to ask your friends and get pressure, or inacurate information.  Don't worry.  You have every right to be curious.. but you also owe yourself to think this through fully as well.  Good luck to you!

That's the only way you'll know.|`|1AgnCpCbaa	confront her and be like wtfff hoe|`|AA10909290	I think you should break up with her, and don't talk to her anymore if you don't want to. You can give her the cold shoulder at work, but only if it doesn't interfere with your work. Remember that work is more important...and your boss will see it that way, too!|`|6lRygPWqaa	try to go back to the way things were before you started seeing her, you don't want to get fired for being rude in the office or wherever you work. you just need to be able to tolerate her.|`|8WmMVyGOaa	Don't ignore her don't give her a cold shoulder. That is just feeding the fire. You guys just started seeing each other right? Well, is official that you two are together?   Plus it depends on how you found out.  If she told, she cares about you and felt bad.  Be mature and talk to her about it. Ask her calmly why she did it.  You guys need to decided if you guys like each other enough to make this work.'I cheated on my current boyfriend when we started dating (about 4 days in)  and I told him 9 months later. He loves me enough to get over it and talk about it with me. Good luck..  be nice this is a situation that could make a relationship stronger or ruinin' it.|`|0OGC6IIraa	I would be the adult and be civil, and nothing else.  if she continuously pushes her luck, and tries to talk to you about it, I would tell her she lost her shot at civility even, and then ignore her 100%.|`|lIZdtFiUaa	she doesnt want you....... get over it|`|ynRUkjIXaa	that hurts !! move on with your head up high and dont let it get you down, as for the future, dont date within a work atmosphere, if theres problems your stuck with seeing that person everyday, good luck|`|dEzGutVSaa	To you, do what feels right. Only you know what you want. In my opinion, I can not stand being with a person who has cheated on me. It happened to me, I was still in love, but I had to turn away because I didnt want to get hurt again.
610c57fdea7d5e585bcc43fbea02a105aa	wow..well let me just tell you something...i have the same problem..i was dating this guy for 4 years  than..i moved away..to canada he was in france..so..we broke up...he was really nice and treated me like a queen..i guess i was to blind to see that at that point of time..and now i am dating this guy that i have a beautiful baby with..but sometimes my mind goes to my firts love and asking myself how would i react if he would be in front of me...honestly i dont even know..kiss him?  ignore him? i dunno..and the funny thing is that to the day he tells me that he still loves me..so..i think u are still in love with him..how about u let him know how u feel and than maybeu will feel a little bit better.|`|A2u06IS1aa	I think that you are just now noticing that you lost someone special to you. But thats how life is. I think you should try and make it really noticable. If he doesnt catch on, then you should tell him, but also say that you dont want to lose his friendship cuz friendship is really important. (:|`|s4aX6bF6aa	the best possible answer to this is to talk to him openly and honestly about it...remembering all the while that he may not want to give up his current girlfriend...you're gonna have to lay it all out on the line and the risk is yours if he just wants to let the past be in the past.|`|t5UQRABWaa	Well, it's better to ask and have a sense of closure than to do nothing about it and regret for the rest of your life. But again, maybe there's a possibility that you just haven't met the right one yet. In the mean time.. read this:     People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.  When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.    When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.  They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually.  They may seem like a godsend, and they are.  They are there for the reason you need them to be.  Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end.  Sometimes they die.  Sometimes they walk away.  Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.  What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled;  their work is done.  The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.     When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.  They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh.  They may teach you something you have never done.  They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.  Believe it!  It is real!  But, only for a season.     LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation.  Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway);  and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life.  It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

ks2oieV0aa	They like women who are confident, not clingy.  Women who know what they want out of life, goals, etc.  Pretty, nice  xox|`|3sxK2xQKaa	There's a differance between sexy and beautiful. If your Sexy your attractive but there's nothing there. Beauty is being Attractive on the outside and Amazing on the inside.|`|hRsIFRzQaa	im not a guy but i have older brothers .. either he just likes the way you look or maybe he really is into you . i assume that they look for a girl that they can have fun with , hang out . a girl whos laid back who doesnt trip bcuz they are older and they want to do things maybe a girl whos  not strict|`|ZUZezAwLaa	for me its about 70% personality and 40% looks but every guy is different
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Just tell him you found a more convenient way home and do not need a ride. If he pushes it and bothers you then his motives are suspect. If he continues to bother you then you need to report this to your supervisor. You do not own ANYONE an explanation of why you do not need a ride home. If he keeps pushing this something is very wrong. Your family is also right to be watching out for you and concerned as there are men who prey on young naive women (not saying you are naive but these men think all young women are). Be careful.|`|SsI4LLUZaa	"no Thank you" is all that is needed.  Do not answer any further inquiries.|`|faj6WSL8aa	"No thanks" or even "I already have a ride, thank you anyway"|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Darn, I was hopin I could drive cause I'm crazy about you!|`|0tU4jkS9aa	say, go home, you nasty pedophile|`|Myzc9Kl4aa	well, if you mean you don't want him to ride on you at home, that is understandable considering his being older.your family cant decide for you who rides 't  you or who you ride.if you mean taking you home...then buy a car.|`|AVSXCNBjaa	Just tell him that you appreciate the offer but No Thanks (be firm), that should be all you have to say. If he gives you a hard time you know he had ulterior motives and are then justified in telling him he makes you uncomfortable. Just try to be polite, not necessarily nice!  Good luck!
1GeulFHOaa	I used to have this crush on this guy and we would talk a little in middle school but when we got to high school we wouldn't talk that often but every time I see him i just go up and hug him :) I don't have a crush on him anymore. And when i want to hug a guy that I don't really know but I've talked to I just tell them jokingly "Aren't you going to give me a hug?" And then they hug me! :D|`|8q4RhpZWaa	grind against him|`|YjGYQrlMaa	you could hug him after school. like you could say hey *hug* and start talking to him so it won't be that awkward. or when you say bye hug him.

Kq3R7rkraa	she is ur mom , just go up to her and ask her!!!!!  if u want to feel better|`|diQ0oodqaa	Talk to her and let her know how you feel. If mom's depressed, she needs to talk to someone who can help, or go to doctor (not for medicine, for advice). Don't know her age, but peri-menopause can cause depression without really knowing what you are depressed about, she can get help if it's that.    Just let her know how you feel, let her know you love her. Wouldn't hurt to tell your dad and other siblings to do this after you do--she needs to know how much you all love her and how much you need her. Good luck!|`|hQsvuxs3aa	leave with her if you want or maybe she can't handle having a family|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	you need to talk to her. say "mom, i'm really worried you're going to leave us. i love you and need you here." and then hug her. something like that. and if you're really worried, you should tell your dad to try to find her a psychiatrist, someone to help her out of her depression.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i think your mom just needs a little break of what ever it is making her feel depressed.. i dont think she will leave.. but i agree with your dad dont worry about something thats hasnt come and something that might never happen.. give your parents time to work out the differences..good luck|`|kdN0iRdtaa	ask her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WkdW04cNaa	The only way to stop your worry is to talk to your mom.  You have to trust that if a big decision like that is made that she will inform you and talk to you about what is going to happen.  Being an adult and a mom, I can tell you that we all face difficult times that we need to sort out. I am sure your mom is like every other human being who is facing something that she is having difficutly dealing with.  It's okay and I am sure she will keep you as one of her main priorities.  You need to keep yourself together and not worry about anything that isn't necessary.  It isn't necessary if you haven't heard it from her.|`|Lhn7D9L8aa	If she is leaving than try to talk to her and be with her all the time you can. Tell her your feelings about the situation and that you want her to stay. let her have a little time to herself. Be strong and God will help you through it.|`|rfoUif0oaa	Hey i felt the same way dont worry my mom said she couldnt handle it anymore cause she was depresed she said wut if i came home from school and her brains were on the wall i couldnt stop crying but now she's not depresed anymore
C36zE8tbaa	first ask simple stuff like fav. colour and what you look for im a girl and what do you like about me and then ask stuff like the farthest youve gone  whats the thing you regret the most stuff like that|`|AATmqYQ1aa	1) Have you ever had a gay experience?   2) Ever had a 3-some?  3) Ever had wet dreams about me? (me meaning you of course)  4) Do you think any of my friends are hot?      I'm out of questions...sorry.
C36zE8tbaa	well if you go to his cousins house there is a really good chance there will be no privacy at all so there most likely will not be anything happening between you 2    but if you go to his house and he picks you up at 5 that wont leave a lot of time at his house for you 2 like if anything there might be making out and maybe an attempt for him to get his hands in your pants but you can always say no  there is always a chance that you guys might just talk and chill there|`|QEEweJUaaa	It sounds like he wants to hang out with you.|`|SzQKCeRqaa	Sounds like he wants to hang out. He seems like he likes you, I mean, he talked 1on1 for 40min? Wow.|`|hN08l7tLaa	i think you got to be careful of him. maybe you can go out and watch instead of hanging out at any of his home or cousins home. that would be much safer and it allows u to understand him more
sMUiGFPraa	Here in Clark County (A.K.A. Vegas) the confidential license is typically for celebrities. A public license s just that anyone can find out. But a confidential license means you are only married in that state and records are not available to the public.    Do what you think is right for the two of you. Different circumstance requires different types. There is a reason for both licenses.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Where I live, a marriage license if a matter of public record. Not everything is available on line, but anyone who wanted to go to the court house records building and look it up, they could do so.|`|cv5PYXEIaa	If you are going to get married why hide it?

AIftgLEGaa	he may just not have his phone on him all the time. if he is shy, he may also not want to appear clingy or too dependent and overbearing on you. if you casually address it with him, he might change it knowing that it would make you happier that way.|`|XzLUA7ataa	He could be at work if he has a job and needs to earn money for dates.|`|noX4xlvKaa	I understand but I think its time to just tell him straight. No more naggy texts just phone him and say do you like me or not. don't keep wondering forever.|`|EcVVcgZNaa	I would probably be the same way...just wait, give him time.
AoLS7XXTaa	walk right up and say "Hey im ______ nice to finally meet you!" and shake hands or hug (w/e you want)    its a warm welcome for the other siblings and it helps build a good bond ^-^    and trust me, its easier than you think..|`|ReCy0Omxaa	Say hey what's up!

Brothers gotta hug..." tommy boy|`|DGrbpbq1aa	Really, you should make sure before finding them, that your father has already told them about you. Otherwise, it could cause some crazy family drama, confusion, and disbelief.     Once you meet, just introduce yourself. I don't think that there really are any etiquette rules written about this, so just wing it.   "We share the same DNA" usually is a good topic starter. XD|`|BgVtUdMjaa	say Hi, We have the same dad!
tG8matgBaa	aww it got cut off. I like the language and descriptions you use. It feels like i could be there. I love your choice of words
kcwjdMy8aa	There are red flags all over your story. My opinion: as obsessed as you are over this guy - you've got to end it. I know, ending your obsessive behavior is really hard. You are lonely and desperate and it is clouding your better judgment. But what you are doing is hurting both her careers! You need to stop now before you are both out of a job!    You should seek counseling outside of work. This will give you the strength to get your life back in track! Also don't give up if the road is hard at first. Getting over this guy will change your life for the better!     Good luck! :D

If you keep having these feeling you should move since you are old enough.  You need some professional help.  Don't sit in the same sofa with her, use another chair.|`|gdD36vidaa	thats jsut cherry.|`|l3T0wmSyaa	talk to your brother about her, or talk to her about your problem. If he's a good brother, he'll understand,|`|FJ5rWfdKaa	its ok, we all have fantasies. but try not to act on them. that would really mess up your relationship with your brother and that isn't worth it.|`|a7xUvhqpaa	Move out and find a better girl.|`|yiZpsEYCaa	Its hard to say but i think it would be best to tell him you like her. Because then he will understand that you are truthful to him and your not a jerk. i have a brother that always yells at me and stuff. I would just try to tell him that you like her. (if you want)|`|1tqwkvtXaa	honestly im telling you right now...ITS NOT WORTH IT..don't let a girl come between u and ur bro....if u really care about Your brother and his feelings u wouldn't do anything to mess up your relationship with him...you guys live together so your probably pretty close...but at the end of the day that chick ain't gonna be around forever but he's ur bro for life.so don't mess it up now because girls come and go but family is forever and if u mess it up now the relationship u have wit ur bro will never be the same after...even if he does forgive you.      try going out (to the club or sum'n)...look for a beautiful girl for yourself maybe that'll help you get your mind off your bro's girl|`|lh6e1OiZaa	So I take it a threesome is out of the question? j/k :P    You're heading for trouble, aren't you?     I think part of your attraction is probably the fact that you can't be with her. You know, the whole "forbidden fruit" thing. If your brother is pissed now, imagine what would happen if something did happen between you and her. You're also beginning to feel jealous of your brother, which is not healthy at all for your relationship with him. I guess if you really want to avoid a mess of a situation then you need to distance yourself from her. In which case, living together is probably not the best option.|`|kJ7tmwE6aa	move out.|`|lnPIJELNaa	dude, that's your brother.... pretty fkd up|`|2Y5rSTRZaa	Didn't you post this q a few seconds ago? Whatever. I'd suggest that either you talk to your brother (AND BE BRUTALLY HONEST! DON'T LET HIM GET ANGRY AND LEAVE! MAKE HIM LISTEN!) Or, get yourself some space.|`|153o3hafaa	i think u should tell her how u feel and then tell him how u feel and maybe she feels the same|`|Sj74XGh4aa	Your relationship with your brother has  to be your first priority. I don't know if moving out is an option, but it would be better than betraying your brother. I know you are already aware that spending alone time with her is a bad idea. If you know that she's home and your brother isn't, don't go home until he is back. The worst thing you could possibly do is sleep with her. It's something that your brother might never forgive.

AA11311184	Maybe you're ready for a positive lasting relationship - if you've found a lifetime mate I don't see it as a problem unless they are gone away for some reason...    It's usually related to the menstrual cycle. The more thought put into it the stronger it tends to be, so if its impairing your life in the least then find constructive things to do, clean, study, exercise etc. A reduced sugar intake also may help.    Personally I'm against any promiscuity or wasted energy with brief and fleeting rewards. Always be honest about who truly loves you, and what benefit it may be when all is over...

t5UQRABWaa	It's better to TRY asking him if he still has feelings for you. It's also better to do it NOW than to wait... because if you don't hurry, you'll lose out and you'll regret. If he says no, at least you know and you can probably start working on moving on. If he says yes, then good luck and I wish the both of you the best.|`|Q8QQpKPUaa	you say u need him and he's the one... but i guess that he broke up with you... and he hurt you... so i shall say he's NOT the boy you are looking for, he is NOT the boy who can make you happy, he is NOT MR PERFECT!!! see, he hurt you and he's gonna do it again if you get back together... i know it hurts, i know exactly how you feel coz i've been through it... but just think about it... just because he was looking for you means what? maybe he wanted to see if he still "has" you...! enjoy being alone for a while... sometimes i think it's much better because it helps me think and make things clearer in my mind... i see how mush i can have with my friends, how much more valuable than any boyfriend they are and how wonderful life is... enjoy the world aroud you, focus on your career and hobbies and in some time you'll find someone who thinks the way you do... and that's when you're gonna fall in love again...!  when i got hurt it took me a lot of time... but now i'm ok! and i know that if i break up with my current boyfriend who i totally love, i'll find my way, because i believe in myself and i'm strong enough to do it, stronger than anybody else!!! just believe that too ;-)|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Stop agonizing about the situation and go get closure.

If you really can't stop thinking about him, you need to do something. Even if it turns out he's over you, calling him and hearing him say that will give you some closure. Good luck =D
lf4Qj1T8aa	This sounds like textbook depression. You really need to get her to talk to someone -- a counselor, a shrink, a teacher. It may only be feelings of self-doubt, but it has been known to escalate into much worse things!|`|FROfw46Yaa	Never give her a reason to think that her worries are true. If she still says stuff like that, sit her down and try to gently explain to her why it bothers you when she says stuff like that, and try to figure out why she feels the way she does. If she keeps it up, you might have to decide if you still want to be in a relationship.     As someone with some self-esteem problems myself, I can understand not feeling good enough for someone. There comes a time, however, when you've simply got to either accept that you are good enough (because you wouldn't be with her if she weren't) or leave. Having to reassure your girlfriend that you love her every once in a while shouldn't be a big deal. If you always have to do it, though, you have a problem. Let her know that it's bothering you, but try to be nice about it...the first time, at least.

CaPZrWVWaa	Hotwire.com    The thing with this website it really is the cheapest because you search for an area, choose the amenities with the price, and reserve without knowing which hotel/motel it is.    Two years ago we got a hotel room with a kitchenette for only $60 for one night for Valentines.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I had friends who could not afford a honeymoon.  Before they got married (in CT), a family friend said they could use his vacation home for a week.  Their honeymoon was at a nice cottage on the beach in Nantucket (off the coast of MA).  It just cost them the gas to get there and food.  They had a great time without busting their budget!  I would ask around and see if any of your guests have vacation homes and ask them if in lieu of a gift, you could use the vacation home for your honeymoon instead!    Another idea comes from what my parents did.  They did not have  a huge amount of money, so they went camping!  My mother grew up camping with her family and my dad had never camped until that honeymoon!  They had gotten a tent as a gift (Mom requested it and got it at her bridal shower).  If you don't own one or want to buy one, a tent can easily be borrowed.  You can also get inexpensive tents at places such as Walmart.  They had fun and campgrounds usually cost a fraction of what a hotel would and some of them even have great amenities like high class hotels!|`|V6uezBBcaa	I think that since its the weekend, you absolutely NEED to go and stay at a hotel. My fiance and I are in the same predicament. We are going to SLC and renting a hotel for the weekend, kids are at moms and dads. And for our one year we are going to go somewhere as a family.     Its not lame to just go home, but come on, its your wedding!|`|k6F9zkIRaa	If you don't think you can afford any hotels in the area for the night then maybe decorate the bedroom. Put roses all around, turn the lights out light candles put some romantic music on, get some Champagne and strawberries and call it a night ;) Good Luck and congrats!    Edit: Don't forget that at the wedding you'll usually get some money, so what you spend on the hotel you may get back at the wedding!|`|d3icrU62aa	honeymoons are usually a week to two weeks, right? how about the night after you get married, rent a room at some nice (not fancy) hotel nearby and really enjoy the night together....I didn't say your wedding night b/c you both would to too tired to do anything, so no point of getting a room....ok besides that, every evening/night for the next week or two (however long you want your honeymoon to last), do something special together....like go watch a movie, lay in the grass outside at night, spend the day cooking yummy comfort food, go for a picnic, go to a part of the town you both have never seen before.....just any opportunity you guys get to spend time together...you can even include you daughter in some activities

When your phone rings you jump to answer it hoping that it is him.  When someone says his name you blush.  When you tell him you love him or vice versa your heart feels warm.  You doodle his name in your notebooks and write his name on your hand.  You hate the time of the day when you can't talk 2 him.  Texting is cool but you love to hear the sound of his voice.  He makes you mad but the love you have for him out ways all the negative.  You are in love when you tell him you love him and it feels natural.  You are in love when you feel the way I feel for my baby Jordan P. I love you Jordan!!|`|hU37TCYCaa	OH my ,   1. do you feel warm ,   smile more then normal , feel as if you could fly ( if you could, ) feel it and ENJOY ,  real love is rare.   you WILL know it .|`|cxqzLUlmaa	When you hold in your farts, then you are in love.|`|F01yCrs8aa	You wont be able to go a day without thinking of them! U will wanna see them everyday, every time they call, or go on MSN or something, u will have this amazing feeling, so yeah, like everyone else has said, u will just know!|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	You know you're in love when that special person in your life seems like the only thing that matters, like you just wish that time would stand still long enough just so you could just be able to stand there and look into their eyes to deeply fall into a state of true happiness.
V5tFbQpiaa	Actually you are a big winner...  You have kept your self respect and innocence in tact longer than most of the people on the planet.     I'd guess that for the most part the people you have met get a bit impatient and likely drift away because you remain true to yourself.  If this is the case I do hope you continue to seek a person who will appreciate you as special.      Once you cross the line you can't go back and even when you wait until marriage for sex the relationship still takes work to stay healthy.  Ask yourself what kind of person is more likely to put the work into a life long relationship - the person who can't wait or the one who can...by their own choice, to respect yours...|`|QMeForAGaa	that is kinda sad|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	its alright. just means you havent met that right person yet|`|txoXobsAaa	nowadays....yes|`|8dPk7QhMaa	you shouldnt feel like a loser. if i had the chance to do it over again, i would want to stay a virgin for a VERY long time. Its better that you waited, than to have the regret of doing it to soon.|`|wNKleK4Uaa	Yes and no. Whats your reason for being a virgin? If you've got morals and beliefs going on, then I'd say its not bad at all. If you're a virgin because you have overwhelming issues in your life and can't meet a girl - then yes, that's bad. Not because sex is utterly important, its not, but because you're not really functioning totally as a human if you're not out meeting people and interacting. But I guess its subjective. If you're ok with it, then why should it matter?|`|e6eFw91Saa	No! it's not bad at all, you don't have to follow the crowd|`|PhBAJtkVaa	it's not bad. it depends on what you want.|`|5FH5EibEaa	I am 30, i wish i am still a virgin..it is better to wait till you find the right person..|`|SkHu40cYaa	Nothing is wrong with being a virgin.  i think its the best gift a woman could have to give to her husband.
CDzStUPUaa	I feel so bad for you;  I'm going to give you advice, but  will you take it???  If you're serious about wanting to try to get him back ... do absolutely nothing.  Guys always want what they CAN'T have so I'm advising you to pretend to him that you DON'T care anymore.  Don't call him;  don't chase after him.  If he calls you, be all bubbly like your life is going great and keep the call brief by saying you're busy.  This will drive him nuts because he thinks he has you around his pinky.  Play this game for as long as you can.  If he cares at all about you, this willl eventually get under his skin and HE'LL start trying hard to get you back.  If this doesn't happen,  then you have to try to get on with your life. Please try what I've suggested.   I wish you the best.

Z3a1cRL7aa	Chances are that your problem is tied to your self esteem.  Either you are to nervous that she doesn't want it or you are too nervous about doing something wrong.  When having sex of any kind, you need to be relaxed  and secure in your own sexuality.  If the only way for you to orgasm when you are with her is to finish yourself off, tell her that you love the way she makes you feel, but that you need to finish the act.  Eventually, she will be comfortable with this, and you will most likely become more comfortable with her, knowing that she trusts you, and you will then be able to *** by her stimulation alone. Hope this helps.  Oh, and I do not think that you need to see a doctor.|`|IFjrOBetaa	go to the doctors (8|`|PhBAJtkVaa	give her advice....? *cough*|`|ENspyhzUaa	lol limp noodle xD

6MHuI3NXaa	awww, your so cute (:  okay so im 15 and probably around your  age range so listen, ask your friends   (who are girls) if they know her and if they say yes  ask them to indroduce you to her and then its in  your hands, when ever you see her in the halls talk to her.  or if your friends dont know her, then find something you guys  have in common and start and conversation about that.  make her laugh girls love funny guys. then take it from there.  or pass her a note. there are a million ways to do this.  all you have to do is come out of your shell.  think about it like this, the worst that could happen is that she  tells you no... and then well move on. life still goes on.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	That's how you do it, you say "hey" and you start the conversation.
7Z9vHytvaa	he can't find for the child's custody, and yes you are right about wanting him to leave, he is not a good thing at all. how would he take the son with him if he can't even support himself, and if he is smoking weed.. i believe he would go to jail for that. i am sure the best thing you can do is making him leave, he is not good for you, and you are still young you can have a better live than you are having now. try to be happier, its not good being sad in pregnant stages..|`|fRsw73zmaa	you should leave him. hes not responsible enough to take care of a child. im sure you can do much better without him [and no court will give him custody with a criminal record]|`|ljHX6LWwaa	Hun what the hell are you doing with such a guy. He is a living hell. Seriously.. smokes weed everyday????? That's insane|`|NxZl1Qccaa	leave him he is a loser and you and your baby are better off without him.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	I think it's best for you and your baby to leave him...he will take you both down with him. He's a poor excuse of a father and boyfriend plus immature. A real loser. You can do better and being a single mum would be way better than trying to make it work with that tosser. You will have 2 babies to look after only one knows how to wipe his own bum. Look to your family for support and if he threatens you if you leave him get an AVO right away. It really is for the best..Good Luck!|`|4VIjILk1aa	He can't get full custody of your baby. He has to prove that you are a bad mother and from what you are saying you sound like a hard working person. He would kill his child for  a car!?! This guy doesn't seem like he's worth it. Think about your baby, do you want your baby seeing all these things? What if the cops were to come to your house for some reason and they find his weed? You can get the baby taken away. He doesn't take responsibility for his other child, what makes you think that he will take care of yours? I don't think your wrong for wanting to leave him, Your thinking like a responsible mother. If he disrespects your mother and aunt then he is disrespecting you.|`|LJuMOlPPaa	He is not getting that child with no money and criminal history. Especially if you believe your child will be in danger and won't be taken care of properly. You are SANE for wanting to leave him. You don't need him. That little bit of money and improper personality he has for parenting is not worth him stressing you and your baby. You have family and a better job. I say leave now before things get worse and you're really stuck.|`|vsOHewLMaa	wow...what did you get ur self into....well what ever has happened already has happened and you cant change the past...but u can change your and your sons future....if i were you..i would leave him....its not as if he has a future anyways and he has no place to g...he got u pregnant and is not being responsible..he smokes weeds every day...wrong wrong wrong...he diisrespect important people..he is a waiter..has criminal records and is sayin some really stupid stufff....i think he has no choice thass why he is with you cuz u manege to takecare of things...he feels secure under you ....if he had a place to go he would have left you hanging......i dont kno its a tough situation...i dotn no  how ur relationship happened and how iot really is when it comes to feelings....but really i think he isnt worth it,,,i think he is using you cuz he is a looser...he has nothing on his hands...|`|DcDyLL7Xaa	Leave him !!!! now ! maybe your scared.. maybe you love him.. but do with for your baby , trust me.! you already know hes not that good at supporting his children and do you really want a person on drugs to be around your baby? and hes already telling you that hes gonna leave and take his son with him??<br>  please.. just open ur eyes, get courage and leave him...<br>  its hard , but when ur baby grows up  healthy and happy , youll be proud and know you did the right choice :)<br>  good luckk|`|I9eSaBJDaa	Leave that pile of s**t<br>  Youve got your own job,house,car<br>  pshh you dont need him<br>  and trust me he is not going to get<br>  custody of that child with<br>  everything you just<br>  said right now.Hes pathetic<br>  so leave him hun|`|YdjU4KqBaa	He is an a** .... i think you should dump him and move on ... i do not think you would want your kid to grow up around such a loser..|`|evJ2GEodaa	you have to live with your mistake forever, now that you two share a child he will be in your life forever. I would recommend that you leave him before he becomes physical, and if you leave him have other people around it sounds like he might get violent.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Girl no of course not. Get out before you let him ruin your life. You'll never be happy with him and you deserve better. Find that baby a better daddy to take care of it! :)|`|RngUbYHfaa	Sounds like a giant loser.  You should break up with him stat.  <br>  <br>  Also, don't worry about custody.  You've got that locked up based on the information you've given.|`|34ikhhtMaa	I would leave him,because this is a unsafe and unhealthy enviroment for you and your kids. My friend was like that and he almost killed her and her child, so I say leave and call Child Protective Services about his other child. I would hate to see her or you and child get hurt. His comment about killing is just scary and shows how crazy he is, so get help and leave.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Jamie|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	I think you were wrong to be with him in the first place and even more wrong to get pregnant. Staying with him would only make you wrong again. He has nothing to offer you or your child. He cant help you in any way or be an example to your child. Unless you see something in him that is good and helpful to you or your child and out weighs the bad then get out now....
vGWD8Zncaa	The guy has issues.    Simple bottom line is - you're better off without someone who makes such baseless accusations and apparently has jealousy issues as well.    He's acting rude and angry because those things are his character.  If you stay with him, he'll find OTHER reasons to be rude and angry to you.  It's a pattern of abuse in a way.  There's nothing YOU can do to change this.    Plus he's not even around.  Why waste your time waiting on an INFERIOR man when you could move on?|`|ba9aa8b3d71c1e710f4561957c0e0684aa	Now I don't know for sure...but history will tell me that when a person starts to accuse someone else of a certain behavior, it is usually because they themselves have engaged in that behavior or they are thinking of engaging. It is a way of deflecting suspicion.    So, knowing this, take a step back and look at the moments leading up to this unpleasant episode. He is across the country, and I'll hazard a guess that he has cheated on you, or is thinking of cheating on you. Sorry! But I do know human nature.    Where he takes this from here I don't know. But now that you know that it is likely him who has cheated and not you, then you can look for more signs, or just break it off.|`|lRTe3AnBaa	sometimes when a person cheats they think everyone else is, we usually think too highly of ourselves and think if we fail then others have to be also.    Another possibility is he is scared because he is away from you and you are doing stuff and he isn't a part of it, he sounds very immature.    another possibility is he is just a asshole.
nVdYIHhzaa	you say women only and you get every guy in here on this question    i know all the girls i've done it to have LOVED it and i know if it feels anything like a bj you have been very stupid to refuse.|`|2YHpV9koaa	Huh?|`|yIHlvPFfaa	heaven.|`|71VRvldJaa	First of all, it's much classier and more mature to use the proper term....oral sex.  "Ate out" sounds very degrading and low class and all I picture when I hear those words are a pig at a trough!    Oral sex can be extremely stimulating and intense if you have a good lover who knows what he's doing.......and I'm willing to bet there aren't any boys in their early-mid teens who have a clue how to do it properly!  If it's not done properly it can be very uncomfortable and even hurt.  Don't be in a hurry to have oral sex with guys thinking that it's a good substitute for intercourse.  It's supposed to be a loving act of intimacy, not a rooting session!  Just read the last half of Tyeler's answer.......ALL the girls I've done it to...etc. and I'll bet he's not a day over 15 or 16!  Where are ALL those girls now who have had his face in their crotch!
C6fm3Orpaa	No way, you're totally right. A few years ago my two best friends and I got into a huge fight. Sadly, the friendship never recovered, and neither did I. Losing your best friend can permanently change who you are, and more often than not it's not a change you like.    So confront him about it. Don't be rude, or mean, but be firm. Tell him calmly how you feel, and what your concerns are. For maximum effect and minimum rambling, you should figure out what you want to say in advance and then rehearse it several times to make sure you've got the right words. The wrong choice in words could change your entire message, so be careful. Remind him of how important his friendship is to you, and how important yours is to him.    Is he big on movies? Go see one together. There's an unusual amount of good movies in theatres at the moment - I myself just went to see Taken, starring Liam Neeson, the other day with a friend and her father and it was more fun than the rental-movie night we'd previously planned. After the movie, go to a cafe or something and have pizza or sodas - or, considering how cold it is, hot chocolate - and talk, about the movie or about school or about the two of you, or anything really.    Also try to do more things together. Get him to join in when you go to audition for a play, even if he's only going to volunteer to do stage-work. And when he goes to hang out with his other friends, see if you can go with him. Maybe if you hang out with this other group for a while, you'll see why he wants to be friends with them. Remember that this whole could just be that he wants to have close guy-friends as well as you, which is a natural part of growing up. Especially for idiot boys. :P    I hope this helps, even just a little. Good luck. :]|`|5dVpkTR7aa	I think it is totally normal for you to be feeling that way! I mean, it's like your losing your best friend, NOBODY wants that. This is normal, and not wrong whatsoever.  Why don't you find time to talk to him, ask to hang out with him. If he's your best friend, he'll listen and udnerstand.      Good Luck! Hope this Helps!    And I know talking about how you feel about this to him, but he's your best friend, you should be able to tell him everything your comfortable with.    -rearose (sariah)|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	no|`|Nh2xYpiWaa	No its not wrong to feel this way at all. It seems as if your drifting apart.    You really should tell him how you feel & maybe compromise on something so you two can hang out together more.    :)|`|QAV4D55qaa	noo|`|0qZpHDb7aa	it is sooo not wrong for you to feel this way, friends are friends no matter what gender they are. you could always just ask him what his deal is.. or you could ask him if hes mad at you. just try to resolve any problems you guys may have and although guys can be afraid of talking it could resolve more problems than not talking could

8YfYh3y0aa	No, give it a try.  But this time, let her choose the time and place.  If she can't do it, then you stop asking.
bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	What's good for you should be good for her.  Either she stops talking to her ex's and you do too, or else you should dump her.  It sounds like she's putting a double-standard on you...it's OK for her, but not for you.  That's no way to have a relationship.  You can do better.    Personally, I actually have a good relationship with my ex's and it remains in a "friendship" state.  However, if it makes your partner uncomfortable, then you should consider severing that tie.  The question you should ask, is whether keeping the ex as a friend is more important than losing your existing partner.|`|lTOeMNnraa	Yes,thrust her she already promised that it wont get any farther than friends   i mean like you say you don't wanna lose her but if you accuse her of cheating then she'll most likely leave you  only say something if you see obvious signs of cheating|`|N3NKLp1Xaa	dont believe unless she talks to him when ur there in person to person... but if she calls or texts him tell her how u feel about it and hopefully she wont talk to him anymore|`|Ar3yyyvCaa	dont go|`|zc47CJZ4aa	Believe her!     She could just be like me... I talk to everyone no matter what our history is. Sometimes my boyfriend cares but its not like Im gonna do anything. Just being friendly.    trust her.     =]|`|LzWGkzSCaa	you should ask her why is it neccesary to talk with her ex when she is involved with you. i would just say its either me or him you need to be with me having fun not him so choose. but give her a chance to choose and dont decide too fast but also dont wait for her forever good luck|`|Q4pp2LhQaa	Don't question her or anything but keep a close eye on her and if she seems to change a little and things seem a little different you might want to look into it.  Don't let her get the idea that you're a pushover and won't do anything if she does cheat.  By the way The Clash is amazing.|`|AbQCkNHuaa	Well, if she says it nothing than it's most likely nothing. And go talk to your ex's and become friends with them. And if she says, "why are you talking to your ex's?" just talk to her about how it's not fair that she can talk to her ex and you cant talk to yours.|`|hl07AmtMaa	just have FAITH in her|`|TOa38qzEaa	**** dat sh!t juss leave dat b!tch....nuttin good can come with juss "talkin" to ur ex's...sorry man,...good luck!! one love!! -|`|PWpxT8o8aa	yes, trust her. if you have any suspicions, like if things get weird or something, ask her about it, and if they continue, then somethings going on.|`|BchJLUOzaa	i think you shoud saty with her till the end untill she decides if ya shoud take a break because if you leave her youll never kno if she was lieng or not and if you lover her wait and let her get her facts straight mean while win her bak to somthing different to try to spice things again i mean its been 7 months hope it helps|`|8sk3n8nVaa	First of all, she says that YOU can't talk to your ex's, but she is?!  That already shows that she doesn't  trust you talking to your ex's.  You should talk to her and bring that up.  You should say that you respect the fact that she doesn't want you to talk to your ex's, and that it is perfectly understandable, but she has to give you the same back in return.  If she doesn't, then you have to decide from there.  Do you want a one-sided relationship, where you are the only one that is giving?  THAT would be up to you.|`|P9alyTunaa	TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT OR GET COUNSELING. TRY TO DO MORE WITH HER TO MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP MORE INTERESTING AND MAKE HER FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN HER EX!    -HOPE U LIKED THE ADVICE!!!|`|Y9cyJ8rUaa	I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER....

When did she start talking to her ex, if she just started talking to her ex on a whim them don't worry about it, but if she show signs of losing interest in you or you guys were arguing then you should leave.|`|hgBSYQmBaa	well, either you have to trust her and see what happens, tell her you don't want her talking to her ex, or go.  i would say give her a chance, and if she cheats with her ex then you know she was not good for you and hasn't moved on yet.  good luck kiddo.|`|mwT9yqTNaa	If you stay there will be trouble, but if you go there will be double

You cant stop her from being who she is. Thats her personality, if you dont like it? well deal with it, becuase shes not going to change. This friend looks like she cares, and is nice.

Bdo2GNA2aa	1. For women, we preen or groom ourselves subconsciously when we are attracted to someone  by smoothing down our hair or clothes, checking our lipstick, or straightening a tie. Combine your grooming gesture with a smile and a gaze. You can also toss your hair to one side  a combination 1-2 punch of preening and a flash of neck.    2. A genuine, friendly smile is youre most powerful. Behavior experts agree that a smile makes you more attractive and approachable. Guys, if a woman lock eyes and smiles with you three or more times in an evening, you have been given an unmistakably clear signal that she's interested. Make your move, if you don't, somebody else will.    3. Gaze the eyes with the person you're flirting with for a full five to six seconds, smile and then drop your fix. Do this at least three times in a ten to fifteen-minute period. Your target needs to know you are flirting with him; making eye contact is a universal signal of openness.    4. One of the more successful flirting techniques a woman can employ is to expose her neck. A head tilt, the classic hair flip, or the over-the-shoulder glance attracts mens attention, exposes your neck, and gives you the opportunity to lock eyes. The over-the-shoulder move is extra-effective because it's sexy and sends a signal to your target that they are worth a second look.    5. Members of both sexes are subconsciously attracted to red, moist lips because they signal youth, sex and fertility. Red also increases a man's heart rate. How to capitalize on it? Wearing a red lipstick gives womens lips not only a youthful color but also a more obvious smile and whiter teeth. Using a super-shiny lip gloss makes your lips look moist and kissable. Men or women should lick their lips subtly (you don't want to look like you're trying out for a porno flick) or bite the lower lip  both are extremely effective flirting behaviors.    6. Men should stand tall with the shoulders pulled back and squared; women are biologically attracted to more dominant men. Feel free to take up some space.    7. For women, crossing and uncrossing their legs is a surefire flirting technique, especially if you're wearing high heels. A woman crossing her legs appears seductive to men and it makes them desire to see more. Slipping the heel out of your shoe and dangling it on your toes is another trick. The arch of a foot sends a sexual message and mimics a woman's curves, and makes a man's heart race.    8. Once you and your flirting target start talking, the next step is to intensify the attraction. How? Smile and maintain eye contact, focus all of your attention on what they say. No one is more attractive than someone who gives you an undivided attention. Employ the nod and head tilt techniques. Smiling and laughing are crucial at this point  it the quickly puts the other person at ease. Making low-level contact by brushing the shoulder or elbow is another effective flirting technique.    9. People mirror each others body language  gestures, voice volume, posture, etc when they are attracted. Very subtly mirror your flirting target's behavior  if she leans forward, lean forward; if he scratches his head, scratch your head. When you mirror someone's behavior, they'll begin to feel, think and believe as though the two of you are connected.|`|Bou11kpzaa	try talking with them over the internet to get a feel for who they are and when you're ready arrange a time to meet them in person. if you want to flirt in person it's all about eye contact and brushing up against them but making it seem like an accident.|`|8eRMjkcJaa	Be subtle about it, but maybe smile at him a lot without looking weird. Make eye contact so he knows you're listening, but don't stare.
5kmMz2qjaa	That would confuse me too! Uhmm, I'd have to say she probably likes you, but there's something holding her back from dating you. I just don't know what that something is and the living too far away excuse, may just be an excuse.  Unless you two live really far apart then I can see her reasoning...   And if she really liked her bf she wouldn't go flirting with other guys. So this is quite confusing..best of luck though!|`|UKP3DWokaa	That would bother me too. Its happened to me. I think that the reason they do it is because they know they backed off the first time. And maybe they were scared to go into a relationship that they think will actually work. The whole having a bf throws me off though. That's what i think though.
zCpYtkBQaa	Live for yourself, or you'll always wonder.|`|MYbRICxqaa	Your question is so confusing to me.    Why are you listening to others instead of following your gut feelings?|`|YJBsyZUxaa	If you like him and he likes you, you should express your interest. It isn't about what your sister thinks, it is about what YOU think.
CqQ1DaKDaa	You should stop worrying hun. People in this world don't tend to be themselves and always try and fight their way to the top or for their dreams/ambitions, and only some people consider others whilst doing this. A true friend would be defined as someone reliable, trust worthy and loyal. Someone who you can talk to about anything and shares similar interests. But these days it is very rare to find a 'true friend' I myself am a lovable person who used to have lots of friends, but after a few things happened in my life I got to see my 'real friends' yet I have no 'true friends' just be happy with the people that you have, but please do not refer to the people who use and abuse you as friends, you should be honest and true with yourself and be with the people you love (plutonically)|`|9YfhGWMMaa	Of course you'll find true friends; if not already:) from what i read here, you sound like a pretty special friend=] just don't look too hard for a good friend; have that certain good friend come to you.|`|Q2z5a4Xpaa	It's hard but you need to find that one friend you know will always be there for you, someone you can put all your trust in........ at the end of the day everyone might leave but your best friend will be the only one still standing by your side
XaywTns5aa	two words- self confidence. she is still talking to you, that should tell you that she isn't freaked out or scared away by who you are. so keep talking to her, see what happens, and don't put yourself down.|`|o8uie3B2aa	well she didnt stop talking to you or seem creeped out so why not let her know its you.  dont be scared shes just a person.|`|EBGp67k1aa	let things go on. don't do the whole " that is not me thing" be a man!!! try talking to her still if she talks to you then she doesn't care. but she probably only sees you as a friend.|`|tjtAhJdiaa	MAN UP! is what i say, honestly what is the worst thing that could happen she rejects you and so what? you'll get over it in a few days and you would atleast know how things went. if u run away you would never know what could of happened.     Also does she still talk to you after she seen your pics? if she is then i doubt it really made a difference and who knows she might like you. you cant be that hideous.    Try to meetup with her and see where it takes you believe me if you never try, you never know. GOOD LUCK!
8SBQ5StRaa	If you like him, he's a jerk.  If you do not find him attractive, he's a nice guy|`|hgBSYQmBaa	it could be either way.  he might like you, maybe not, we need more info..but guys do act like that when they like girls, it's very immature, but that's what teen boys do.  don't have your friends go ask him if he likes you because he'll most likely deny it, even if he likes you.  just talk to him and flirt and he'll come around and ask you out.|`|c8d25898c40e7e6915e612f57f1d7766aa	Maybe hes just a flirt you can flirt with people and not like them in a boyfriend/ grlfriend kinda way. Explore your options and don't worry about this guy if he does like you he'll find his own way to tell you.|`|5kXe739Naa	Never ask a friend to ask him   1 .. guys find it lame.. MAkes you seem lame.    Stop doing a source thing..    He's a flirt and he could think your lame.

CBdKPtUYaa	Sweetie! You sound so pretty to me! Go for it! I'm sure he won't care and if he does then that's his problem. Do you really want to go out with a guy who only likes you for your looks? If you like him and think he likes you then looks won't matter. I have 2 friends who go out and the girl is super pretty and the guy is just average, nothing special. Don't let looks stop you. If love was based just on looks then we all would have died a long time ago. I say go for it!|`|TlU3zj61aa	There is a good chance. Just get to know him as well as you can and make yourself available to him. He should love you for who you are, and it sounds like he already does.   Don't let him and his family intimidate him, you are beautiful in your own way.|`|5nQjGlkVaa	well i dnt noe,,, but go find someone else,,, or wait till he confronts u.|`|CvREWSV1aa	Well to be honest, guys are jerks. Most of them just want a hot girlfriend more than a really nice, sweet, caring, down to earth type girl. He might take your guys' friendship to the next level, you'll never know.  He sounds like a pretty cool boy and he might be one of those guys that will look past the "not so hot" thing. You never know what will happen. Just remember to always be yourself and don't change for anyone!|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Iam 5'7 and weigh 270 lbs. my FIANCE is 5'8 ans 145 ish, so there take that!!!!|`|JqnDk7Shaa	=) i'm the tallest too.... or i was until my cousin shot up to 6'2"    DAMN HIM|`|h0wDABGbaa	since you guys have fun together and are good friends i reckon you have a chance with him. dont shy away because you dont think youre good enough for him (by looks) because not all guys are shallow and who knows, he might think of you the same way as you think of him.  good luck! much love k.|`|hyRj4eIjaa	well think of your self as edward and bella. edward is beautiful and bella, well isnt. so it might work out.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	I've found that womens' opinions of themselves are often not mens' opinions of them. If you and this guy get along really well already, then why not try testing the waters? Flirt with him a little more, suggest some one-on-one hanging out. Take it slow and feel him out a bit. If you get a positive response, then be a little bolder and ask him out. Don't let your insecurity stop you from having a potential love match.|`|qpWStE5Saa	all guys end up liking a girl at some point wen theyre friends. trust me. been through it many times. my families attractive too. check me out. i like my friend that isnt that hot. not just saying im hot. but iv got talents, not tan cuz im a red head. musical. srry too much bout me, but yea, hes gona lke u eventually.|`|SHBqweGEaa	If he likes you then It wont matter what you look like. Think of it as a test if he really likes you then It wont matter what you look like. just drop a few hints see were it goes|`|wXVzRXxFaa	of course you have a chance! looks shouldn't really matter in a relationship anyway.     if he really cared for you, then he would look right pass your looks and go straight for who you are and what your personality is. good looks are just a bonus|`|pfke6Jieaa	ok here's the thing. im iraqi and my gf is filipina and yes im taller than she is by almost a foot (im 6 ft tall and she is 5'2 ft). my family is mostly 6'3-6'5 (i know i have a taller than average family). even the women were at least 6 inches taller than her. she thought many were good looking in my family but she was no where near intimidated because she knew i like her no matter what. not to mention also we r different as far as culture/race goes.     my advice to you is that you get used to being around them. if it causes u a problem because u think u will be attracted to them then thats bad for sure, but if u just think they are good looking and oh well then yeah there shouldnt be a problem. u worry about looks too much. men care a lot about confidence. looks dont mean squat if u r not confident.    EDIT: hold on i read this girl's comment about dropping hints. DO NOT DROP ANY HINTS. just be casual. men dont like a woman who fishes for compliments trust me. as sweet as it may sound to you it will not be fun for them. its ok to ask once in a while once u know him but DONT do it now. just be casual and see how he acts. thats the test. that girl seriously doesnt know what she is talking about and she is gonna make u more insecure. what a dumb answer no offense.|`|upqJU9yiaa	hey give it a shot!    Ive been told im one of the best looking in the family and I come from a pretty hot family lol     But thats not the point, I used to have a friend (that was a girl) that would always hang around me and we would always have stupid things to laugh about and spend the time talking and stuff and that just made me like her more and more and although she isnt the hottest girl around i liked her for her.     Sometimes the people who can go out with pretty much anyone usually settles for simplicty. Like i hate super conceided chicks but they like me. they expect me to like them but im just not interested in those kinds of girls.     Just try and see what happens he might like you and you dont even know it!       Good luck =)

I think most women would want a man who can appreciate them for who they really are . And no, women don't appreciate men cheating on them. Unfaithful men are not attractive.     I'm not trying to be hostile, just truthful. You asked what kind of man a woman is attracted to and we are just saying that women like the kind of man who respects them. Hope this helps. : )|`|4U7327Mzaa	Rich and can take care of you????  I am so glad I am not in the market.  You are already a jerk if you are just looking at the pocket book.

Get with the program, brother, and quit being so shallow!|`|V780bRMRaa	Um.. no woman i have ever seen has ever been ok with her boyfriend using her for money and cheating, my opinion, be a man and treat women right|`|LMPF5X4raa	Wtf..u sound like an *** hole.|`|ciQjwtTcaa	Go home to your mom if you want a woman to take care of you!  you give guys everywhere a bad look.
P49jDxMAaa	Firstly, highlight the fact that your brother is spending too much time on the computer. Tell your parents that at his age, he should be focusing on school and should be beginning to help out around the house.     If your parents can some how be enlightened as to the consequences that could result from him wasting such a great deal of time on the computer, than they may actually understand and subsequently care enough to straighten him out before he wastes any more of his life and develops a lifelong tendancy to disrepect you and his parents, because that seems to be what he's doing.    Maybe your older sister should spend some time looking after your younger siblings, maybe your parents could take turns in order to "take the load off" you. It's only fair, right?    You should let your parents know that you do have other priorities at your age. I mean, it's kind of unfair that you and your boyfriend have to spend so much time together in the presence of your brother and sister. It almost sounds as if it's complicating your relationship. Let your mom know that she should be grateful that your boyfriend is helping out, it's hardly his responsibility.     I think that if your parents can understand, truly understand, rather than just having some knowledge of how you feel and the effect of the situation on your life, they may just to you seriously this time and could even come up with a solution. They'll have to eventually if your moving out, so it would be best if they put some consideration into the whole thing now and a possible solution.    Just talk to your parents, and reason with them in a way which will mean that they can't let you down.     Hopefully you and your parents find a solution, even if it involves confiscating the computer and begging your older sister to hel as well as confronting your parents once again.    I'm sure it will work out.    Good luck.|`|9jMHaJnQaa	Move out in 5 months...she'll get the hint. Just make sure your boyfriends not a deadbeat.  I also found in my younger years that a seriously long silent treatment to the parents is quite effective. When you finally do speak the first thing you should say is the part about your brothers' help lasting for a week and then he and they stopped and put it right back on you then go silent again for about a week and see what happens :D  As to what some others are saying there is one immutable and universal truth in this life. Nice guys finish last(that is unless they were born with a silver spoon up their...bleeding hearts? Your family doesn't notice you now you think leaving on the moral high ground is going to make a difference for longer than say....3 minutes? They'll probably notice even less because they won't see you while they're looking down. They constantly look down when they walk don't they? Or look at the PC screen or TV constantly....huh?  Good Luck  you could also hack the passwords on the computer and change them all to something none of them know , then feign ignorance. Revenge is truly a dish best served cold.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Watching your brother a few hours a week is the least you can do to contribute to your family.     I'd say you're pretty fortunate if this is the worse thing going on in your life.    Consider that, and enjoy being with your family for the last few months you will be there. On an aside, a sign of maturity is being able to undergo a transition without initiating a conflict to give the appearance of an excuse for that transition  in other words, you don't need to be angry or fight to leave. You can just leave peacefully.
WkdW04cNaa	I agree that this situation is too soon for all of you.  I think you should talk to your mom about your concerns.  Open up to her and let her know what is going on in your heart.  The good and the bad.  She needs to hear what is going on with you in order for her to make good decisions for the family.  If you don't talk to her, she is going to go with what she thinks and she wont know how you feel.  You have to talk to her calmly and lovingly.|`|SmnWSJxIaa	Emily, first of all you have to go to God and ask him to help you not let your father go, but ask what would your father prefer. Then talk to your mother in a sensible way. Don't be mean to her boyfriend and truly express to him with your mom present, the emotional toll this is taking on you. But give a sincere effort to respect him as an adult. Emily you will be in my thoughts and prayers and right now I pray that God heals your wounds and comforts you everyday.
oQBzf5tYaa	Get new Friends|`|llgBLR6daa	well what brought you guys together in first place? There has to be something you all have in common or else you wouldn't be friends|`|veZLfnGFaa	Then it's time to make new friends.  Keep the old ones, but find some friends that are interested in fashion as much as you are. ;)|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	maybe you are abit more grown up then they are they are still in the stage where they are kids yet. well that is fine. you will just have to find someone to hang with i guess or just hang with guys and be happy.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	try finding some new friends to add to your total (of friends) that like the stuff your into and also there are some really girly manga's out there you could check that out, try High School Debut the books :) they are my fav hope that helps|`|OkR3hrzZaa	Well as you get older you will find more people that relate to you. You can also join some online website for fashion. Friends don't always have to have things in common. Maybe you could ask them to just try and do something you like. Maybe they will even like it. Friends aren't only people that you share common interests with. Friends are people who aren't going to judge you and people you can talk to about anything. People that make you laugh when your sad. They dont have to like fashion to be your friends. Maybe that's just something that your going to have to enjoy on your own for now. But you could ask them to just join you in a day of something you like and want to do. Real friends would have no problem with that. Good luck.|`|9YfhGWMMaa	Try making some new friends that you can turn to for fashion advice and stuff. as for ur friends rite now, try to relate to them in the area or category that they are interested in and they will also try to relate to ur interests, also=] don't worry; whatever happens, happens. it'll all work out:)|`|11VwVTYYaa	well try to find other friends that are into that kind of thing. im sure there are people out there near you who like that kind of thing.|`|xBxAD5NZaa	make new friends that are intrested in fashionn|`|ND5KncX0aa	find another set of friends who have the same or similar interests as you do, you don't have to hang out with the same people all the time.. And you really can't be angry at them for being who they are.  They're your friends, you chose them.|`|exnkBKzgaa	Sounds like you guys have grown apart. If you don't share the same interest find new friends, but still keep in touch with your current friends.|`|Q2z5a4Xpaa	you need to find other friends that like the same stuff but in not saying leaveyour other friends|`|9a6251beadb4d54d694172749ab2f735aa	There you have it!...just keep them BUT try new sets of friends that you can relate with...or maybe, Talked to them first your interests, maybe they will learn something "new" from you.....and maybe, they will be more interested with D&G or Banana Republic....what I mean, maybe you can find something that you are interested with them....and be their fashion consultant..maybe?|`|3cQJhSqXaa	LOLEMOFRIENDS

She is interested, but you really dont want to push it to far too fast. she obviously trusts you, so thats a start. Just talk to her and get to know her. Find out if she really does like you.

5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	why are men pigs?   Who knows... but you should be asking yourself WHY YOU MADE OUT WITH A MARRIED MAN ? what does that make you?|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Methinks the lady protesteth overly much...|`|ARCURrPhaa	Sounds like there is more than one pig in this scenerio.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	Unless you have it on tape, it wasn't me.  Even if you do, "i was drunk...someone slipped me a roofie...all three of them had weapons and threatened me."    Sounds like we all missed a really good party.|`|wnb0EgaHaa	Hmmm...my thoughts...  from what I know of YA, you are gonna get jumped on with both feet because of making out with a married guy, making out with a guy you don't know, and being at a wild party.    So, here's what I recommend you take away from the experience and your question...    People's morals and values vary greatly.    You saying all men are pigs is the equivalent of them calling you a slut for doing what you explained.    The guy at the party might have been a pig, or maybe his wife was there too.  There are plenty of people who will say both of them are pigs if that was the case, and others who will say it was all good as long as he wasn't doing it without her knowledge.  Others will assure you that yes indeed, all men are pigs, and others will jump on the other side of the coin to point out that all women are sluts because of the behavior you described.    You feel no remorse about being at the wild party where random people who never met were making out and participating, but you're bent out of shape because one of the guys you made out with (but didn't know) was married?...    I'm not judging you or anyone else...it's not my place, it's a waste of time, and I'm quite sure there are many who would cheerfully damn me to hell for many of my views...so, with that said...    You have the right to your own morals and values whatever they might be.  You draw your own boundaries and limits.  Others do the same.  The best way to avoid crossing your own boundaries is to have them clearly defined and accept that it's your responsibility to protect them.    Making accusations that all men are pigs because you allowed someone you didn't know to cross a boundary line that he probably didn't know existed?    Priceless.  And pointless.    The situation is about personal accountability, not men being pigs.|`|AA11586960	well i wont Judge you    All Men when they get the chance to have sex will take it, it is an animal instinct it is the way we are made    he is the S**t but they will call you names     Something like every one lost is one missed because you cannot catch up      when i was single every single girl was fair game but never got involved with the married ones to much baggage|`|UtzkaqPaaa	I totally agree with j|`|DgWUovrQaa	So you are generalizing that ALL men are pigs???    And why would you want to make out with a guy that makes out with any thing that moves?|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	Why do you have sex with men you don't know? If you don't know him well enough to know about his relationship status, then you shouldn't be intimate with him - for health reasons, if not moral ones. Saying you didn't know he was married is no different from saying, too late, that you didn't know he had AIDS.  Get smart - because if you come on here asking dumb slutty questions, you are inviting insults.|`|xUCXXb73aa	don't freak **** happens|`|AA10327722	If you knew he made out with 2 other girls then why did you make out with him.  Didn't he have a wedding ring on or atleast a tan line on that finger.  Look next time.  Also you can insult men but we can't insult you?  Grow up and stop making out with guys you don't even know.|`|71qGan9Raa	Perhaps you should not go to anymore wild parties because most people there will lie about their relationship status. They are there to forget, have fun and be wild. So, it's hard not to judge when you said you made out with 2 other girls. Who cares if he's married! you had a good time didn't you? That was your purpose.  Men aren't pigs....you got what you wanted!|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Women do the same thing, be careful at your next party and don't make out with anyone until you know who they are.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	We are not pigs - we are opportunists.|`|DccR3Gmuaa	why do you make out with married men    ok you didnt know he was married but you knew he made out with 2 other girls, maybe you should think about what your doing and not worry about why hes a pig.
kbIkVS0raa	He committed adultry not you. It is not your fault you were not aware of his marriage. Just don't let it happen again but don't beat yourself up over it and no you are not a whore|`|zDeFibxzaa	makes you wonder?hmm although you yourself didnt ,unless you are married too? you were a part of it and therefore it will learn you a lesson i suppose !|`|c8a188861f0a854648ff16ed2a2476a9aa	You sure did! Stop getting drunk and slobbering all over God knows who. How trashy.|`|iD4ejChZaa	no because you aren't married, but if you had sex then you commited fornication, which is equally as bad a sin.|`|m81dfyOYaa	You can only commit adultery if you're married and have sex with someone other than your spouse. Getting drunk and making out with guys isn't very smart with all the sexually transmitted diseases out there.|`|LC8iYnncaa	if your not married then no u didnt commit adultery, but he did.. next time me more careful and have more common sense|`|ksqPjgEUaa	A little bit...|`|gC8xO53Oaa	He was the one married, so he commited adultry.|`|wc9viY4Saa	Yes, yes you did. If you can't control your alcohol..Don't drink.|`|bJF3tGtfaa	No, he did. It wasn't your fault.|`|eUf9e81eaa	You committed an adultry because you could have asked him if he is married in the first place and besides, being drunk is not good.|`|AA12187979	No you were just acting like a trashed whore that didn't get enough time to consumate the adultry she was about to comitt.|`|nE95Hnn5aa	Sounds like a hot night!  However, before you go and start saying that you committed adultery u need to be made aware of a couple of things.  Only a person married, legally or scripturally can be guilty of adultery.  You, if you are single would be guilty of fornication.  But you have to understand what adultery or fonication consists of.  It involves what is commonly known as porneia, which is defined as :   The Greek word porneia, translated fornication, has a fairly broad meaning. It relates to sexual relations involving persons not married to each other and focuses on the misuse of the sexual organs. Porneia includes such acts as sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, and masturbating another personconduct commonly associated with houses of prostitution.     If you and this married man did not perform sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex or masturbating one another, then neither one of you committed fornication or adultery, respectively.  If all you did was kiss and some heavy petting, then again, you were not guilty of porneia.      I hope that this helps you.  I also hope that you will become more careful on who you become intimate with.  You might want to think about how his wife is going to feel when she finds out.  Not really worth it, huh?    Take care|`|71qGan9Raa	are you married? if you're married you did commit adultry because your heart was "stained" for another man.  If you're not married, don't worry about it. It's just a fling|`|ORy1HG0yaa	You didn't, he did. Unless you are married. My advice: stay away from wild parties.|`|t5EE6WO8aa	if you're not with anyone then no, you didn't commit adultry, he did though.|`|Chcoqnv3aa	I don't even know what to say.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Yes you did.  It doesn't matter that you aren't married the person that you were kissing was and the act is on both of you.  Don't feel bad because you didn't know and you best believe you aren't the first female he has kissed besides his wife.   He sounds like a real azz.|`|YJBsyZUxaa	You didn't know he was married, so he is the guilty party. However, you do have to take responsibility for getting drunk. That showed poor judgement and will get you in a mess of trouble. If his wife ever finds out, you run the risk of her coming after you..
PtHkKEjTaa	Just tell him that you like him because it seem like he likes you too and guys don't like playing games also they like girls up front because they are too dumb to understand the girls body languages and what they are trying to say.|`|O1WxKk7uaa	hang out with another guy and make sure he sees you|`|LnzUMUCdaa	to get him jealous make him think ur interested in others  but maybe u shouldnt make him jealous just back off for a while n to get him to notice u dress cuter good hairstyles make up n be more talkative do ur best to stand out|`|yPAdMJbDaa	dont make him jelous.    make him think you dont like him that much anymore.    just friends...  and he will come CRAWLING to you.|`|cwx0Lridaa	Well, give other guys boob hugs if you have C's or D's.

It doesn't matter what age your children are, parents should never ever fight  or degrade one another in front of their kids.  If they chose to live together even after the divorce they should be civil, at least be good housemates.      I don't have an answer for you, sorry, but I would like to suggest that you tell them firmly that if they choose to fight, let you know in advance so that you could take a walk and ask them for how long you should be walking?

Don't tell him make a myspace and make your page private and if he finds out then tell him it is none of his business you are doing nothing wrong. All it is, is to keep in touch with friends.

If its love like then tell him you love him. if he Truly love you he would get rid of the *****!  FRom: BS:-)|`|2gn5KLixaa	Sounds like you've allready made up your mind. You ask for help but then you basically tell us not to tell you what you need to hear. This guy is a player, he'll do the same to you that he's doing to his girlfriend. YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT. you're not going to change him and you're not so hot he's going to give up his side action. Be realistic. If you want to get with him and are willing to be used then go for it otherwise you know what to do.|`|OdTLUprzaa	Tell him that you're not into players.  That should make him think.|`|TNNSHdypaa	"but he says to wait till him and his gf breakup"    Yeah, that comment, along with him being a player, sure makes him a lovable person.|`|GXVanwgPaa	he's taken! too bad so sad! i got the same news last week! and it's heart breaking but u can't have him!|`|ssYy21DNaa	play hard to get and then blow him... im a player and i like blowing|`|wl85WhsTaa	hire a hitman to take out the gf and then you can take her place.|`|D8bTsWr8aa	Just ask him if he will change his player act to be with you when he is single again.|`|VMAhim63aa	i wouldnt go out with a slvt|`|QA62m6Y7aa	forget about being on a romantic level with him, find a better guy for that.    you can still be good friends like you are now, but try not to fall into his charm.|`|oQq1rqDVaa	Well the way he is treating his present girlfriend should be a warning sign to you.  Obviously he is just using her until he is fed up with her.  Better watch out because next time it could be your turn!  Leave him as a friend and make sure he knows that now!  He isn't worth the pain he will cause you in the long run.|`|sYSEYHAzaa	do what he says and wait till they break up|`|egSPGgtpaa	sounds good. but just be careful those hos can turn on you quick.

It's all up to you.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	If you were his girlfriend, what would you want "you" to do?    You may like him because he always compliments you and lets you be you.  It doesn't mean he is the one for you.      He should not be talking about you kissing or anything like that, he is being disrespectful to his girlfriend.  I wouldn't wait.  I don't care how nice of a guy someone is, you can't have your cake and eat it too.    You must end it.  Tell him he can't talk to you like that.  It is disrespectful to his gf.  It is disrespectful to you.      You will meet others who you can be yourself.  It is really you that inhibits you from being yourself when your self confidence is not high.  You can be yourself with anyone, if you wanted to.      You know what is the right thing and what is the wrong thing.|`|H8pkaoodaa	Growing up is hard to do, I know. And your reaching a milestone now that will define you for years to come. You don't want to offend him yet he makes you feel awkward when he becomes a player.    Simply and this is from a great deal of personal experience from going through it and helping others through it...he is playing you. You will either be someone he can conqour then dump or his friend on standby for when he goes through a dry spell.    Sorry, and I know you will think I am wrong and dismiss this but honestly you think you can change him. I thought I could change a gal who was the female version of a player. The only thing they ever care about is themselves. Sucks I know...but it's what is.    Leave him, even as a friend.    Even complete jerks can be the nicest people in the world...I kinda live by this rule.    It's not how nice they act, it's how honorable they are. He acts nice but not honorable.|`|ofL8anLWaa	if he has a gf, stay away, i know its hard but seriosly theres gonna be so much drama if it ends badly!

It certainly isn't because you are so brilliant or charming.  It sounds to me like you want to tell them that you aren't interested and more importantly, WHY you aren't interested.  It also sounds to me like you don't even want the friendship of overweight people.  Why don't you just tell them that you aren't interested in going out with them ... period.  If they ask why not, just tell them the truth ... that they can do so much better than you.    And why the heck isn't 50 answers good enough for you on a question like this?|`|Hizsm6m4aa	You may have to give visual cues. Like go someplace: McDonalds, Wendys, etc and when you see a big person go on about how disgusted you are with how they look.

Nor lazy. And you shouldn't judge people just on their looks.|`|nCrSOm9vaa	Just say no. You're not obligated to feign interest in them, and sometimes it's better to be honest up front then to lead someone on.|`|IalZYnUVaa	If you're not into them that's fine and you should tell them that politely. I just hope that you're not going to say that any girl who isn't "fit" isn't good enough for you. Because a person can be healthy without being skinny. The two things are not necessarily synonymous.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well these girls aren't your type. Which is perfectly normal. You want a girl that you are interested in to, not just the female being interested in you. You want a good relationship anyways. Also your 2way street thing is wrong. There are fit women who date fat men and fit men who date fat women. It depends on how that person makes the other happy and their happy it is not built into our brains so you need to rethink that.    Also not all fat people are lazy and all. Some people get obese because of depression and other sicknesses. Like another person said, there are fat people who are more healthier than thin girls. Thin girls who tend to eat a lot and don't exercise and obese people who watch what they eat.|`|KN9icVNRaa	You are absolutely right, they shold wrk harde to make themselves more atractive, just turn her down like you would any other girl, come up with some other random reason though, because she will just send all her frieds after you if you say it is just because she is fat.    good luck|`|kmAMgkiraa	Obviously you are shallow or you wouldn't be so rude about there weight. My close friend is overweight but she's super healthy. Maybe instead of bitching about how much they want you cause you're oh so fit, invite them to the gym to workout with you. And don't be such a dick. Tell them that you're just not interested, there's no point in telling them "I don't like you cause you're fat." Even if they ask why just say I see us as friends. I've had guys like you try and ask me out and I turned them down because their personality was disgusting. Trust me your "fit looks" aren't anything to brag about.|`|ksrZqdFHaa	you don't have to tell them they're fat. just say you aren't interested. say they're not your type.|`|CJ4mhsFYaa	You: hey fat ***. I HATE YOU! I WISH YOUR FAMILY WOULD BURN IN HELL!!!!  Her: WAH!!!!!!
WmM3XeLPaa	Ugh. I feel sick even reading about such a nasty person.    If it is getting that serious, I would suggest going to your parents or a guardian or teacher and telling her you need help. Guidance maybe? Ask a close friend of yours for help or back up. Or, even just totally ignore this girl. Tell her straight out you don't want to hang out with someone that is so mean. Tell her you would like to make friends that aren't jerks to them. She's no true friend at all. So what if it hurts her feelings? She'll have to get used to it. It's her problem. She's making this bad for herself.   Most people that act like her have parents that are divorced or problems, like ADHD or something like that. I know someone almost exactly like that. I try to be nice but when they are mean I just back off and go off with my real friends.   If she wants to be your friend, tell her she better be nicer and respect her more.   I had one girl that used me to get up to different people so she would get attention.  Tell her she shouldn't be using you to get attention. If she says she isn't, you should tell her to take another look and walk away.    GOOD LUCK!     P.S. When she gets to college or the future where she meets reality, she'll suffer. She'll fail and won't succeed and have major problems. Just keep being yourself, and fight back or run lose. :) Good Luck!|`|R0o5rvpGaa	ummm that's not exactly what i consider a friend... drop her... don't talk to her at all.. get new friends because this girl is a strait up b*tch            .|`|L7QH81Uaaa	You need to stop being her friend because she is using you. it is so not worth it. just think of how many other friends you could have if you were not her friend. if you hate the way she is imagine how all of the other people that are not her friends feel.  Everyone has friends that they cant stand it is just part of life.|`|OZdfouWlaa	that's not a good friend at all! I would talk 2 her if i were you and tell her how i feel.

If she does that homework thing again, tell your teacher, and if they dont believe you, have your teacher talk to your parents. Talk to her parents, and if they are stuck up (no offense), have your parents talk to them. Explain this situation to your parents. Also, about that "hotter than you" thing, do the same thing back. I hope this doesnt cause trouble, but seriously, if she actually says to her face than she is hotter than you, that is pretty bad. or just plain ignore her. Dont invite her over anymore, or go to her house. Try hanging with other people. OR one day just treat her the same way she treats you, and she will freak out and ask whats up. Then you would tell her thats how she acts and your sick of it. Except dont do anything that u could get in trouble for, like taking her homework.) Just really tell her how much of a jerk she is, and sooner or later she will have no friends, and your the first one to leave.

ANYWAY, try taking my advice. just ignore her=]|`|VyHMmGeaaa	Wow What kind of friend does that?  Exactly Is she really ur friend?  u have to stand up for urself  Dont hit her or do bad things back to her  Just tell her how u feel and if that does not work get ur parent/guardian and tell them how u feel and the way its bothering u  Or tell her parent she might get a scolding!   You dont have to be her friend  Just dont hurt her or anything like that thts not of god (sorry if to churchy) I know u probably want to murder her!

rMNWd17saa	It sounds like he doesn't hear you, even when he hears you.  It is sad that someone who is supposed to be so religeous doesn't believe in forgiveness. I know he is your father and it would be ideal if you and your children could have a close relationship with him.  But sometimes people just don't get along, even if they are family.  Being a mother I can't imagine not loving my children no matter what.  There is nothing that they could do that would make me love them less.  It sounds like that is how you feel about your children as well.  Like you said they are your family now.  They are what is important in this world.  Learn from your father. Take the good in him and leave the bad.  I don't think you should think of him as dead and mourne him.  You may spend years mourning him and then when he really goes the pain will start over again.  Don't do this to yourself.  What I do suggest is to forgive him.  Not for him, but for yourself!  Sit down and just pour your feelings into a long letter. You don't have to even give it to him, just right it to get it all out.  Tell him how angry you are, how hurt you are.  What his actions and words have made you feel all these years.  Tell how much you hate him, how much you love him.  Tell him what a great woman and mother you have grown to be despite him and what he thinks of you.   After you are satisfied in all you have written him, Tell him that you forgive him!  Let yourself forgive him.  It is only when you honestly forgive him that you can begin to heal.     We never know when we will lose someone we love. We don't always to have closure and too often leave things unsaid.  We regret not letting those we love (even those who don't seem to return our love) know that we care.  Not for your father, because it probably won't change him, but for yourself, send him father's day cards, birthday cards,  pictures of the children.  Don't expect anything in return.  You''ll only be dissapointed.  Do this for your own concience.  You do the right thing even though he doesn't.  You won't have any regrets in the end.  And when he does pass away there won't be any words left unsaid.   You've already begun the healing process and it will be easier on you.  It will be easier on your children if you have inner peace.  You can't go through life feeling guilty, you deserve better.  You are a great mom and a great person.    I hope this helps, I really feel for you.   I don't have a close relationship with my father, for different reasons.  And it really hurts sometimes.  Even now.  Good luck and God bless you and your family!|`|tp61e25Eaa	Unfortunately you will have to limit your contact with him for the well being of your family. All of the negative that you have experienced with him; you know that you never want your family to be like that. The ball is in his court. On holidays still call him and be nice, let him talk and politely get off the phone. Let him continue to be the one who has determined the fate of your relationship. Life is short; try not to stress over other people's emotions, you can not control them. It is his problem at this point, just keep being the good parent that you are and hope that he will come around some day.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	I don't think you will ever heal, but it is plainly obvious that he is disrupting your kids lives, especially if he has abused them in anyway. What is really best for your children. I have my issues with my father, he left me for his wife and said that I was dead to him. But I also believe in unconditional love and I love him with all my heart, and despite efforts he continues to ignore me. It has been two years since I last spoken to him, and its been hard. You have your boyfriend and your kids to support you, as I have my fiance and future children. We both need to focus on our own lives and those of who we love and just respect our fathers desicions. Leave a message saying that despite everything you will always love him and you will always greet him with open arms. We should not scorn our fathers, or mourn them. We should celebrate the life they have given us by treating ourselves with the dignity and respect we derserve right?  I really hope you can do your best, if not for you but for your boyfriend and children.|`|aRodN6qKaa	I feel for you. I have a ignorant, nasty father who is 78 and verbally harasses me and does not appreciate me, which hurts. I live with my dad cause my husband and I separated years ago,I have been out of work because of health reasons. He hardly talks to me. If I try to hold a conversation he starts to argue so I avoid talking to him. I feel alone living with him. The other night at dinner I said to him "You do not appreciate me or respect  me" He goes you have to earn my respect !" I said "Oh yeah? Then you have to earn mine!" He then said "I want to live alone!" I said "Fine,I intend to move out of here by the end of the year" God willing I get the money and he goes"Yeah, right!" So trust me,I can feel for you.   My advise is go to therapy. I go to therapy once a month cause he has ALWAYS been this way because I physically look like his real mom who had to give him up for adoption during the depression, that is what my mom told me. As soon as I move I decided I will cut the ties once and for all. Really go to therapy, you need to talk and get advise from a therapist on how to handle your dad, how to move on,and how to mourn.   If that was my dad and he told me to never call and see him again I would say FINE! It is better your kids are not subjected to that verbal abuse then have a bitter, nasty grandfather. Also my grandfather was just as nasty as my dad, he called me every name under the sun, verbally harrassing me. He lived out of state I told him 'You apologize to me else I'll never speak to you again "  he didn't answer me so I said "OK bye!" I never spoke to him after that then he died a few years later trust me you are doing your kids a favor by NOT knowing their grandfather, if you have him in your life and your kids lives he will cause you nothing but sadness, hurt, and angry bitter  feelings of rejection towards you and your kids.   Best of luck to you.
fP46meSmaa	I would confront him and tell him to stop spreading that rumor or you are going to start spreading your own that he is gay. if you are seeing guy's,I'm sure they wouldn't believe him any ways.**
d8fSVX23aa	I am a catholic parent but I can't put my faith onto my kids too much. My eldest moved in with her bf and it hurt but I wouldn't allow her to have him stay over at our home so she moved out. This is my faith and obviously not hers.    They will still love you, but will be sad as I was that they were unable to install in you their beliefs. I see my daughter and her bf all the time and will have to accept her choices in life.|`|UQWusO1waa	they will think you are Whore/slut with no discipline.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Explain to your parents the abuse you recieved in the previous dorm and then say that you want to move with someone you can trust. This is why you have decided to move in with your boyfriend. Stress that is has nothing to do of things with a sexual nature and that you think that this is best for you. Make sure you also stress that you are in a serious commited relationship with this boy, and maybe a little white lie of marriage if he proposes unless of course this is true. In America you have to be eighteen for sex right? Well you are an adult and they should respect you and your desicions.  Try and make your boyfriend be with you, and have him stress that he only wants to support and care for you and that he wants to have a good relationship with your parents and he respects their values and religions and doesn't want to go against that.  Good luck, hope things work out.  Raych|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	If your looking for their approval you won't find it.  So, best thing is to just be honest. Tell them like the adult you are, and if they try to pressure/guilt you to making a different choice say, "Thank you, I respect your opinion but I disagree."|`|T3b4I4kXaa	I don't blame them. It is generally a bad idea to move in with a BF. You wind up performing the complete role of a WIFE, without the legal protections. You will need to get on real birth control just so you don't wind up having to move home with a bun in the oven and having to start from scratch with a far greater burden. You certainly don't move in with a BF unless you have made it clear that you expect to be married within a certain time frame... or he gets kicked to the curb. The pages of YA are loaded with girls who went to live with a BF and were left holding the bag.     The only time I would ever suggest moving in with a BF would be after engagement and maybe a month ahead of the planned wedding ceremony... setting up housekeeping.     I don't blame you for not wanting to dorm.   Check with the student union and try to network among your friends for a roommate arrangement in a multi-bedroom apartment that will work. You can install a replacement doorknob with a keyed lock to keep your stuff contained. You can also sit everyone down for a meeting to set the rules of the house... everything from when everyone has to have their share of the bills on the table, to hours, to common area maintenance. The whole thing about roomates is that it is first-and-foremost a business relationship formed to pool resources (money) to cut expenses (rent and utilities).
L7hlVa1oaa	well i dont, sorry, but i think that you should give those ppl that like you a chance. you never know how it will turn out. see how it goes, say up front that you just wanna see where it goes and see if he is up for it. also live your life,  this is a new you, be confident, you got this gurl good luck and hope you find the right guy out there for you.. best wishes
YkQ3QVg0aa	This will work out for your benefit in the long run. Don't worry about it, people think I'm a few years younger but if you think about it, it doesn't REALLY matter. Even if you drink milk or exercise your face will still look the same. So work out if you want to build muscle or be healthy, but don't do it to age yourself. There are freshmen in highschool that go to the gym and take creatine to get "built" but they don't look older by doing so. My boyfriend is 21 and he looks young too because of GH he took when he was young. Seriously, don't worry. If you want you can smoke cigarettes or do meth, you'll age about 20 years in a couple weeks on that crap. Just kidding, don't do that.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Looks aren't everything.  A lot has to do with how you act.  If you act older, you might look older.|`|N1ot1wpRaa	Grow some facial hair if you dont have any, eat more and try and beef up :)|`|11VwVTYYaa	yea maybe you should work out a little.   but you can't help how young you look|`|olxjR4ooaa	drink millk so u could grow taller and u have a siblings|`|9YfhGWMMaa	mmm, im sure ur perfectly fine the way u are. if u really want to look more ur age, trying working out more and eating some more healthy foods. drink a lot of milk; tho i dont think that will really benefit for a 21 year old. but yeah, other than that just ignore what people say about u r probably just perfectly normal.
5fjbNeVNaa	Probably because you are attractive...That might be it. Or they are laughing at you    But I would stick with the you look really attractive|`|EiS6jnApaa	That happens to me too.    Its either:  1. The are creepen on you  2. They want to talk to you  3 or you have something on your face    ;)    goodluck|`|ycKGiUCAaa	Possible Pimple Burger Bad Hair Day etc|`|VVcfs0IXaa	maybe they think ur hot or something. guys usually do that when they like u|`|PNkhcbMcaa	thats what guys enjoy doing at school, no one likes actual schoolwork|`|g59U5kwUaa	they like you simple just tell them it makes youu feel awkward then they maybe will stop  (:|`|PGqMKRL7aa	you're either really ugly...or really attractive...it's up to you. Alot of guys just zone out. They're not looking at you, or anything else for that matter. haha.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i don,t know ! maybe they like the way you look or they like your body.|`|FnQWXyp8aa	well you are either pretty, terrible unattractive, you have a mustache growing, your top is falling down, or they are just zoning out.|`|vTNWiFPwaa	zoning out?|`|fBdtvrWdaa	You are probably really pretty or really ugly. Or your top is too low. Or you have gunk on your face.|`|LKMWuopNaa	they like u|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Because they are young and immature and evidently can't talk.  Young guys these days act so dumb and it is a shame.  If a guy likes you he should smile and introduce himself and ask for your name.  That isn't hard to do at all.
mgwiuZT0aa	Whatever she is nagging about, fix it. If she continues to nag then she is unhappy with herself and she is nagging at you because you're there.|`|tVvhbPLfaa	women should never nag a man thats a rule. Let a man be a man simple.Thats cute how u love her this is always sweet. She just loves you, sweety... awww this is her nagging reasons though.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	She sounds like my Chihuahua, he suffers from separation anxiety whenever I leave the house. I just give him a raw hide bone to keep him busy, you could try that.|`|SmnWSJxIaa	Travis maybe she loves you that much. Alot of men would love for their wives to take them along. It's just that she's still attracted to you. Don't be that macho guy who pushes her away. Because remember one man's junk is another's treasure. And then you wind up with the opposite type of woman who shows you no affection at all!|`|49A8M4ZSaa	Talk to her about it. And if she still continues to do so, you have to wake up ! You will end up not respecting yourself. If she really loves you, she will give you space and respect you. Wives who do that can manipulate their husbands in all aspects.I think you will be happier without her.|`|2gvwTS4aaa	Sounds to me like she just likes to spend time with you.  There was a line in a recent movie that says it all to me, "the only problem in our marriage is that she actually wants me there".|`|zDeFibxzaa	some women are just naggers,they do it to get you involved with them.you ve heard of training animals to do things right.get on the boat man.|`|71qGan9Raa	I can't stand nagging people! They drive me insane. You'd better get a handle on this or you're going to be for a lot of long long years of nagging.|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	Crazy in love?  Dude, you MUST be young.  Give it a few years.  You will want to knock her *** down the steps.
PbFL8jh2aa	Fifteen/sixteen is no-longer classified as a "little boy." Instead, he's a teenager with testosterone coursing through his body. It's normal for teens his age to have sexual drive, and some guys seem desperate (especially around that age) to have a female "partner."    Seeing as his parents know, I think you should tell them that it concerns you and that if it keeps going on, please ask them to reprimand him seeing as you don't like him coming onto you. Try not to hang out too much over there, and don't return his text messages.|`|gFqeMs22aa	he may have a crush on you, please don't crush him forever and make him afraid of women and relationships for the rest of his life.  if he indeed sent you that message and not one of his pranky friends, let him down easily. this is YOUR test, are you a real friend or are you a stuck up snob who gains power by crushing a young man's heart (i sound like michael jackson, sorry).|`|pbkXFhfkaa	Uhm im guessing that he was with his friends and they took his phone and texted you. So just bring it up and see what he says. Cause its more than likely that that is was happened.|`|95aa65cba63310787837a79e4fc382edaa	Maybe he thinks your his mom and he has developed a huge Oedipus Complex.    Or Perhaps he thinks that he will be able to mooch off your social security money when you turn 70 years old.    P.S. To the thumbs downer, I was joking... learn to chill.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	So what, he has a crush, be gentle with him, don't help turn him into a creep, but let tell him you have a boyfriend or something...      When you are 32 and fat, I bet you look at him differntly...lol|`|tlUihEOvaa	That kid is like 1 year younger than my little brother. You're the same age as my cousin who is already engaged.     I guess he has a thing for older women. Maybe you look attractive to him or it's something you've done for him. Younger men cannot control their lust as well as older men. I remember when I was 13 this 17-18 year old girl was messing with me, I kinda had a crush on her. But it more of lust than love because she said very explicit things... She even got really close to me one time to scare me. It took place in a tutoring center.     Maybe when he turns 18 he will find a job and marry you. =] Or if a hotter girl his age gets to him then he's gonna marry her instead. =\    Most young people don't know what they want. They think they do but they don't, as they get older they realize how wrong they were.|`|eLUUA4ljaa	naw he probably, know that u wont talk to him but he just hopes you might understand how he feels about u just to get it out i guess  either that or someone prank did that to you    i did something like that to my cousin before    what i meant was prank call my cousins phone|`|8yE2sYGeaa	His emotions are in turmoil and he sees you as more than a big sister but a potential partner.    This crush will pass

He doesn't reach it until age 30, so you being fully mature make you better equipped for the often childish and stupid things he will still be doing.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The first thing is to apply for the marriage license at the County Recorder's office.  It costs a little bit of money, you have to both be there and bring your ID, and there is usually a three-day waiting period before you can get married.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is to have someone who is licensed to marry people sign the marriage license and have two witnesses.

We woman are ridiculous we don't know what we want, oh admit it ladies. You want someone to snuggle you, next week you'll say he is smothering you.     Every woman is different what works for one isn't going to work for another.  When you find the person your supposed to be with you will be everything she wants, just be yourself don't try and be someone that your not.  It will not work if your not "Real".

Lol, which is good, I suppose - there's someone for everyone, if only you can find the right one.    For me...intelligence is important, as is confidence.  A little cocky is okay, arrogance annoys the crap out of me.  He needs to be able to communicate, and he has to have the ability to make me feel like I am the most special woman in the world.  He has to be able to listen.    Lol, he can look at other women, but he better have the good sense not to stare at them and drool while in my presence.  I admire strength of character and bravery, but he needs to have compassion.      I want him to know and understand himself and his motivations, and have the capability to be honest about those things.  A man who knows himself is usually willing to be himself - I don't want someone trying to be what he thinks I want him to be.    Chemistry is imperative for me...it's either there or it's not, and if it's not, no matter how gorgeous or good-looking he is, it will not work.  I'm not much into the metro-sexual type.  I prefer "guy" guys, lol.  If he has more hair products than I do, we would probably not get along.:p    He has to have a sense of humor.  I'll stop there since I'm sure you'll get a lot of ideas from others as well.|`|mtV7dWJHaa	I think we all want pretty much the same things in a person.  I agree that intelligent, funny and sexy are wonderful traits.  What I first look for in a man is sincerity.

Getting deep inside someones soul is pretty heavy but I've been there a time or two and know exactly where you're coming from.      A man that can make me laugh and be extremely sexy as well is the BEST!|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Love, loyalty,respect, friendship,security,honesty and one who listens and communicates.

Look at the type of person you married the first time.  I was married and divorced and it took my step-dad to give me this advice.  Know where you've been, know where you are and know where you want to be and give yourself a year to find who you are before getting into a serious relationship.  Best advice from my mom was if it feels like deja vu run and don't look back.  My husband & I found each other by accident and we both had the same wants when we met and talked.  I didn't want a man in my life that was controlling, needed a maid, that could take care of himself if I was away and would take care of me if I was ill.  Basically, I didn't want to be involved with a man that needed a mom.  He really didn't have criteria for me to meet and since I cook (very well) and he doesn't that makes him happy.  We've been married for 8 yrs now and he fixes things (sometimes I help) and I take care of the house.  With everything it's nice to know that you can work together, don't criticize if it's not your way and no matter if she gains weight (sometimes not her fault/menopause) that she's always the most beautiful person in your life.  We take care of each other and have disagreements but we always know we love each other.|`|71qGan9Raa	a best friend! and help around the house|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I agree.|`|ORy1HG0yaa	Go see the movie Fireproof, and buy the Love Dare book. That'll tell ya.|`|t5EE6WO8aa	the biggest, most important thing to me is a man that can make me laugh. my husband can always make me laugh even when i'm mad and i love that. also, you have to be caring, thoughtful sensative and romantic. those are my main qualities, oh and don't forget to have morals too.|`|qW4GVjROaa	We would like someone, who really cares about us and our feelings, someone who really listens, not with half an ear while reading or watching tv. someone who tells us when we look nice, someone who puts thoughts into our gifts, like buying nice perfume or earings and it does not have to be expensive.Someone who will say come on lets go out to lunch/dinner/breakfast, go for a walk on the beach. Trust us, give us a hug, just cause you can. Someone who will go to the movies,travelling, musical show, just to do something that we like to do and not always what the male wants and we get to do things on our own. And these are the reasons I broke my marriage up after 40 years.
7IDu3Gveaa	respect is most definatelyyyyy one of them, dont everrr treat a girl like shes some sort of toy, like you can just play around with her feelings, never ever do that. and trust. and you have to be able to make the girl laugh or smile, cheer her up whenever she's down :] always be there for her no matter what and when she feels like shes falling, always be the one to catch her :] oh and, never say things you dont mean.|`|enEvZqPBaa	respect  fun dates  funny moments  cute pics for memories  commitment (not marriage or anything just no cheating or eyeing other girls)    thats it at the beginning of the relationship

kTLIj0rmaa	Dang you dont waste any time do you? Maybe you should give yourself a break from dating for awhile. If you keep this up you will never find a relationship that lasts. And never ever start out a relationship with lies.

If you do not he might find out one day from someone else and it probably will be all gossips so you better tell him.
aJ1aaOi9aa	you timed it..and you compare the time with other people?  wow you guys are 12!..lol|`|wWw1rL1jaa	hahahahahhahahah wow....just re-read that question for me and tell me how mature you really are. hahahah timing it?? seriously?? Let me guess you had it all planned out too???

qJsPwHdPaa	This is going to sound so cliche, but more than anything else you need to have a spark with them (and them with you) before anything will happen. You could technically be doing everything right, but without some chemistry it won't go anywhere. Just keep waiting; it's worth waiting for the right one. What's that old phrase? Something like "Better less years with the right one than more years with the wrong."|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	you need to have that chemistry factor....you know..|`|qbS7d8RHaa	you forgot smelling extra good.    it always turns a girl on, trust me :D    i love it when my boyfriend smells really good.    get some nice cologne :]    like vurt or armani or fierce from abercrombie.
onYpx5Gxaa	Ugh. Teenage hormones suck. I suggest thinking about the girl having Rosie O' Donnel's head or having it be her normal head with a fat harry man's body.
Gh0qq0s5aa	Something happened in her life to make her behave the way she does.  Maybe you can start by letting her know that you think she is reacting to something unpleasant that happened.  Let her know that whenever she is ready to talk about you will be there for her.  In the meantime you have to be very patient with her until she is ready to open up.|`|oclvWDzPaa	sounds like she likes you!!

mMfWgm38aa	I think if you buy a journal ($5) you can write all sorts of things in there for her.<br>  <br>  Your life with her dad (good stuff only) Your pregnancy, when she was born, cute things she did, Family history.  What type of qualities she should look in a husband, pass all your wisdom.  She will treasure that for the rest of her life and maybe pass it on to her daughter, adding some words of her own.|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	Maybe a nice charm bracelet or italian charm bracelet along with a charm that signifies the special occasion or your feelings for her. <br>  <br>  A different route would be to schedule a mother daughter day filled with things she likes to do or lunch and some pampering. <br>  <br>  Another cool thing is to maybe make her favorite meal for dinner and if she does not already know how to make it teach her. <br>  <br>  You may have noticed most of my suggestions focused more on bonding. Most mother daughter relationships become turbulent during the teen years. If you asked most teen girls they wish they had their mom as a friend as well as a parent. Due to her age I am assuming you feel like most days she would prefer to be with her friends. I was trying to think of things a 16 year old girl would like to do with mom where there would be plenty of chances to just talk and have a good time. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope the day is as special as you hope it will be.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	how about starting a Pandora bracelet
3kCmqrnzaa	Well maybe their parents don't let them go out much & they are just too embarrassed to tell you  Meeting new people is great cause if they stab you in theback you always have other friends  Give them a chance though  You can meet new friends by just going up to someone & saying hi  You may be embarrassed or shy but just do it  Or if you have a myspace add some people from your school..tlk to them there & then tlk to them in person  Very simple|`|d3pC3763aa	Your friends could be busy, People have different priorities and you could always join a club. There's more people out in the world than just them. You meet people by doing the things or activities you enjoy, and you'll make friends.   You can give your friends a chance but I bet if you joined a activity you'll be too busy when they want to hang out you'll say sure and until then just try to find a activity you enjoy!   :) Take care!|`|11VwVTYYaa	well start asking the same people and start talking to more people and making more friends. if your so called friends act like that, i think it's time to make new friends.
105Ti39vaa	Don't stop being friends with her!  Just after she says something rude, tell her.  Stick up for her when people talk about her.|`|aRIA86D8aa	The thing about friends is that we tend to be influenced by them even when we don't know it. If you don't like something about your friend tell her about it, if she is unwilling to change then you need to give her space and not be so close a friend. Choose friends that have the qualities you want in yourself, qualities that you know you need or you know are valuable and you won't go wrong.|`|OwfoyXpraa	First of all, ignore her clothes. (: You should like her for her, not for her clothing.    And secondly, tell her when she's being rude. Tell her that you respect her, but what she's doing/saying is mean/rude, and you don't appreciate it.    Hope I've helped a little, good luck hun.  (:|`|SUzn3qfzaa	Dont do anything just let her stand up for herself.

So your not Samantha A? WOAH. I know a girl named Samantha and she was adopted and she has a rude friend. So I thought you were Samantha A.       Okay I'll help ya now. Why don't you just ask her kindly if she could kinda change her attitude. OR why don't you just ignore her?|`|4nNqZOVqaa	If she is your really good friend, you can just brush off the comments other people say about her, and maybe your friend is just going through a stage...im not sure. But if you catch your friend doing something rude to somebody, just tell her to her face "that was rude." maybe it will make her realize.
EPTaL9Ajaa	I disagree with the 'all'.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	i agree that MOST of them are  but not ALL of them! :D|`|s4VzPulYaa	Most guys are immature, and most girls create drama :|  too bad that's the way it is.|`|nyeUUojFaa	not all guys, but most seem that way, yes.|`|XdBbAHbbaa	Only some guys. Middle schoolers are like that a lot!|`|2hs3t4auaa	Not all, but definitely most my age.|`|YeR6R8Feaa	i dont think guys are like that. some are.. but really not that many. guys do have a higher sex drive or whatever, but thats just how they are|`|PJM71Izjaa	guys in my grade, age group are pretty immature. im 16 btw.|`|fZfVM1unaa	I think more than half the people who post on here have never washed a dish and don't even do their own laundry.  Maturity is something that develops with personal responsibility.  It doesn't matter what sex you are.|`|SQbAqf1raa	some guys seem like that.. but not all.     btw, you forgot superficial cocky jerks. :)|`|rVdcXJ8aaa	Well in my time I have met a few guys who aren't like that but in general yes thats how guys these days tend to act.
XuoT57Idaa	It is normal and healthy. This is the way you learn about your body and makes sex with someone more successful:)|`|sLWC6vEmaa	nope... no negative effects... its completely normal, everyone does it one time or another|`|0RDsd7eYaa	Absolutly not!!  It's having sex with someone you love!  and you can't get any diseases from it!  oh and it relieves stress
jxqNTr9Iaa	An individual,independant,preferably brunette,slim,pretty,clever,funny,quick witted,adventurous,brave,easy going and quick to laugh,has self respect,willpower,she has to be femine but not girly,tells the truth,playful and creative.|`|l1qNr8gQaa	You must be a DESPERADO:  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=RU50RRMsdm...|`|y73Y4aEPaa	interesing:)|`|58OjH1Osaa	you try to be sexy and seductive and find out what he likes and try to reel him in untille he's yours
JbDfdJb8aa	Place a blade in his mouth and say, "Why so serious?" In a scruffy voice.    I am only kidding. To be honest, I have a similar personality and I find that often a few drinks helps to loosen me up.     But, one thing is for certain: everyone laughs. Jokes pertaining to his interests might be more useful than those you are accustomed to. When people smile and chuckle, insecurities and discomfort goes away.    Ultimately, you cannot change who people really are though. If you didn't like his personality, you wouldn't be with him in the first place, right?|`|YdWLfV4Eaa	Dump him? You can't change someone.|`|oB3DvAzMaa	I fell in love with a guy like that. The bad news is I still am and he moved on. All i can say is when he's mad, let him be mad honey! Let him have his air and breath. Let him clear his head. Just text him or call him out the blue and let him know you're thinkin bout 'em. Just try to do simple things to make him think "wow she really does feel me" or "man i was just thinkin about her" and maybe his serious shell will crack. Best Wishes! I know how it feels!|`|PXtvuD9jaa	If you love him ...well you will have to learn his flaws but if you are not sure how you feel about him ..just talk to him. Show him how its like to be free, happy adventures and just simple. Show him how life...or just a single day is boring without laughter and happiness...you know math is cool and it is really awesome the fact that he is smart and everything but being smart doesn't give you happiness. just for one day show him what it is like to be you. Give him a ride on your.... no rules care free train...be the man..(Literally) and just take control....okokokok girl|`|f4DHP9ysaa	ask him why|`|QeohvfRRaa	Give him time to loosen up.  Some guys need to warm up to a girl before the seriousness goes away.  I've dated plenty of those guys and they just need time to feel more comfortable and confident.|`|kBW9ihIlaa	yes my bf can definately get serious. what i usually do is smile at him tell him to smile in a cute voice! then if that don't work i make these really stupid goofy faces at him and that usually works for me to break the silence then then we're laughing and joking! mostly ya just gotta figure out what makes them laugh! good luck!|`|pTrjBgg2aa	break up with him because you guys are to opposite|`|zTeW6BIIaa	it sounds like he may just not be your type. if you REALLY like him and you want to stay with him, why not trying to do something really fun with him? go miniature golfing, bowling, skating, anything that could possibly bring out his fun side. try to have fun conversations instead of super intense ones. introduce him to boys and girls you know who are also fun- go on group dates with your fun friends. maybe if you engage him in the right activity and conversation he'll get out of his shell.     if it doesn't work out between you two, don't be too hard on yourself. try to find more fun guys in the future- guys who like some of the same things as you and who you have fun with and have something in common with. remember, your boyfriend isn't just your boyfriend- he's your BEST friend. if you can't have fun with him then it may not work out.    good luck!! :)|`|HgMaoYIvaa	kick him in the face as hard as you can.... that will change ANY one.
MZ8uqhNEaa	If you just see anything on the ground, pick it up and put it away.    Be kind to your siblings, because that will help your mom a lot.    Do dishes.    Do all some chores, and vacuum everyday.    Help, or take care of any animals you already have.    Clean up the kitchen, that helps moms a lot! :)    Do laundry.      I hope I helped! Congratulations on the new sibling, and kitten! :)      P.S. I admire you for asking this question. Not lots of people would care enough to want to help out their mom. :D|`|mYAbq6fnaa	just help out with chores around the house that your mom hasnt gotten to- clothes, dishes, vacumming, dusting, etc. and when you get your cat, make sure that you take full responsibility for it and dont make your mom remind you to feed it or give it something to drink, you know, take care of it. that will help her out a lot.|`|775Tqe9caa	Cook for the family, wash clothes, dishes, buy her flowers or candy.  Wash her car.|`|lbMUNNCuaa	Very important that a pregnant woman does not handle or come near cat poop. Highly toxic for her and baby!  Bringing a pet in the home raises many concerns. Germs, illness, diseases, feeding, litter. My biggest issue with cats is the odor of their urine. As cute as cats are, that cuteness doesnt go far with me when the smell and their hairs are everywhere. It is a huge responsiblity! You will have to care for this living creature for the rest of its life. Through sickness and health, good and bad. My son was bitten by the house cat at my mother in laws. I would think it over if bringing into a home with young children. Be able to commit yourself and enjoy the care it takes to raise and love.  Good luck!
ONgNhr7Eaa	honestly it depends on your personality. However if you are unhappy that you are so thin don't try to eat a lot because it is unhealthy, if you really want to work out at a gym and bulk up a little. A girl would like you if you are tall and skinny, or short and fat, as long as you have a great personality that's all that really matters.|`|AnRxCLZXaa	it depends on your personality|`|O1WxKk7uaa	if your that womans type yes but most women like the personality|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well you are not suppose to be this weight for your height. I wouldn't like this but that is my opinion. Every girl has their own choice of guys, some may like it and others might not. I like muscular guys but others don't, it depends on how that person likes their men. Also. it is personality that matters too.|`|DSGoBgHHaa	Not really...I tend to like bigger guys. Just eat a lot, put on some pounds, and turn them into muscles!
7yrdcqY1aa	dude shut up are you really complaining? jk :) well shes in the mood for you, for girls it means you make her Happy and you satisfy her sexually! way to go!
XBlA0hiMaa	I'm pretty sure its "rewrite" not "re-write".|`|tvOAeGAnaa	Yes, Yes, and Yes again!!!!! I just read a question, where the individual spelled people....peiple....and the name Anthony, Anthiny. What the hell is that? I don't understand. There are some words that you should be able to spell, using NO Spell Check!|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Or maybe they just don't take their grammar on YA seriously.It isn't like we are writing a term paper here.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	You too have noticed that people can't spell and they can't put a sentence together that we can understand.  How do you like the fact that these teenagers are so immoral.  Into playing at sex like it is a contact sport for them.  Then coming on here to ask how to handle it.  Where are the parents?        I agree with you that we may be becoming totally illiterate as a country and isn't that a shame.   They don't even know how to turn on the spell check when it is right in front of them.|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Especially when we have a spell check on here!|`|7cjqT33Baa	No doubt.  The ones that bug me too are the ones that start their answers with "sweetie" "hun" etc., as if they are trying to sound so sympathetic to the person therefore moving front in line to get their 10 best answer points.|`|y21VcTjDaa	I have no problem reading questions that are penned by someone for whom English is not their first language...after all, their English is way better than my version of their language!  But what really gets me is all the ridiculous abbreviated forms of words, and the way some people type but leave out all the vowels..and the worst has to be the use of the term "Baby Mama"  ...these are the people who will wonder in years to come why they haven't been overly successful.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	No. It's juvenile.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You are so right. I want to "grade" these questions rather than answering them. Makes you half way wonder if some of these are from 6th graders pretending to be older.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Yes. I find myself NOT answering a question if the improper use of the English language is used....(lol)    But, I like the red pen idea. It's something we could look into. Have a correction pen for improper spelling even though there's a blessed open spell checker...  Other times I just don't "get" the question people are asking so I try to figure out what the heck they're trying to ask...|`|71qGan9Raa	the lingo is definitely changing....many times I have to re-read questions like:  ru gonna b th-air?   YIKES!  Our language is definitely evolving|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	I completely and totally agree. I don't know how half of the kids on here are going to get into college.....|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	Yes, yes, yes!  I am convinced the primary problem for most of our more editorially challenged writers is a complete inability to communicate their ideas.  The text short-hand drives me up the wall, along with all the "so I go . .  ." and the "and so he goes . . . ".|`|xtcwWlUJaa	I just look at it this way. If a persons question is too stupid to understand, then there is no way any advice I give them is going to be understood either. I usually just decide that the writer is an idiot and not worth wasting my time over.  Yes we live in a nation full of the functional illiterate, and they all seem to enjoy some yahoo time (lol)   Also those questions with too little info or WAY too much info are totally skipped. If you cant bother to give me a little detail on your problem then I figure you probably cant bother to follow through with any suggestions that are made, and why should I take 10 times as long to give you a decent answer as you took to ask a stupid question?    When I see WAY too much info ( you know exactly the type I'm talking about) I tend to think the asker is just trying to justify the position they have already decided on and wouldnt care what my answer was. And, be honest, do you really care enough to read through all that stuff anyway?
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	He might want to break up, or he has already broken up with you(doing the old guy don't call).  Depends how bad the fight was.    Or he might just need longer to cool off.
duChRdNwaa	'thesbian' is a theatre term dum dums. Gah. Not a bright bunch of people are yall? And no she isn't.

But then again maybe they aren't and that offended her?or she doesn't want u 2 no(or she thinks if u no u might spread a rumor).|`|lbMUNNCuaa	Articulate and enunciate and the magic will happen. Perhaps she miss heard u and thought u were being fresh, lol.  I am a Thespian. She probably heard the L word.  Then again, perhaps she is a drama queen and just took an improvisational opportunity.|`|pbDLvO9Jaa	Take her to the nitro burning funny car races and she can be a drag queen.|`|70zN1XjNaa	slap her back.|`|AA11588446	Perhaps she thought you said "lesbians". Of course if they are thespians, then they are into drama.|`|wiE8Lr5Gaa	she is a total dog poop licker! you should offer some of your own poop for her to eat!!|`|71qGan9Raa	How offensive! You're lucky that's all she did to you. Why would you insult her and her mother??? Did she attack your mother? You must have expected a result like that didn't you??? What did you think that she was going to laugh or nudge you in the arm?
ExBaodthaa	because they're annoying, have no manners, and don't know how to properly approach a girl.|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	The basic idea is the guy wants to make a noise to get the girl to tuen and look at him.

If you are female~be happy for your friend that she is going out with someone. Be a best friend and understand. If you are male it sounds like you might be jealous of this new guy.|`|hwKcqXp6aa	I say you should just let her date the guy, you have to understand the situation she's in that being thirty and never having a boyfriend must get really lonely. Be supportive to your friend and once a relationship between your friend and the guy is established i'm sure things wont be as spontaneous as they are now.|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	be honest and tell her that is not nice to do 2 a friend and tell her if she continue to do so then when he blows her off she cant come to u,, cuz you will blow her off 2..    or just do the same thing to her once so she will know how it feels!     I allways do thing to people that do tings to me just to show them how it feels and it really helps! =)|`|qWGz1NYYaa	Try something non confonting like 'hey i havnt seen you for ages, lets go out (insert date) and just have a girls night with the two of us' . then a few hours before your get together send her a text saying 'hey im really looking forward to tonight, see you there!'.  that way she might see how much it means to you and at least feel a greater obligation to pull through with you plans.  hope that helps|`|18afBRSXaa	I get how that would be annoying. REALLY annoying. So what you do is when she finally doesnt blow you off, be talking and then go, "Why arent you and so and so on a date 2nite?" and see what she says and if she asks why tell her that you felt bad that she kept calling last minute and then when its about to get bad you change the subject to something fun. But make sure it doesnt involve him.
yIHlvPFfaa	tell her you think that you are ready to take another step in your relationship and that you are ready to have sex but you are willing to wait for her. by telling her youll wait will often make her have sex with you sooner instead of her doing it with you and never wanting to do it again til who knows when, so be willing to wait until shes ready but go ahead and tell her that you are.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	let her know you love her and you want to take it to the next level.|`|LaL8wRp7aa	id be all like DO ME *****|`|BuGz6eU9aa	just lie and say you love her and want to show her with action instead of words.   any bs you can think of that sounds romantic should be used.  if that doesn't work, try another girl.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Unless you are gay, or are studying for the priesthood, she knows you want to have sex. I'm assuming, of course that she has a brain, and that you are a healthy male.    You DON'T NEED TO TELL HER !    If you are unable to make her want to have sex then you have a little maturing to do as a lover. If you have to ask her for it, you don't deserve it. And she doesn't deserve to be used for your selfish purposes.|`|dXs0A2xlaa	when you two are in the mood be like:  HEY SEXY THANGGG LETS GET IT AWN!!!  and then she will take off her clothes and be like okay i love you!  works every time ;]  just make sure you have a condommm|`|LLAdQwCpaa	just hold up a condom and be like are you ready?

And that person is too gentlemenlike to try to do anything :P plus he's shy in that way.    So yeah, still haven't. I'm waiting, cause I want it to be perfect.|`|AA10037028	16, but that was forced upon me and i didn't want to have my first kiss then anyways.|`|FarsCSY1aa	I got mine when I was 12... but many of my friends didn't get theirs until they were 15 or 16. And we go to a school, where there are many guys.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	haven't had it yet,  and i'm glad.  hahahaa|`|AA12133308	Don't worry when the time is right you will find just the right person, don't force a boyfriend upon yourself. Just because having a boyfriend might be the cool thing to do, you don't really have to have one. My advice is to wait until you are at least 16 to have one.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	about 7 or so.|`|cwx0Lridaa	10 years old.|`|MIR3eC5kaa	i made out with my girlfriend at 10 and i still usually do|`|2PTG2YqCaa	Im 10 and never even had a boyfriend. I sorta wanna get it over with! I almost had a boyfriend. But I was dumb and asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend! I do have a guy I like and am planning I want my first kiss to be with him.    Luv,  Ozzy|`|jZlLzRziaa	i think i had my 1st kiss at 8
YMdYyRmqaa	9th grade. He was in 10th.    than when I was in 11th i fell for this girl and kissed her my sophmore year of colllege.  than I am now her girlfriend. lolz|`|wWzO9xARaa	First boyfriend in 7th grade, first kiss in 7th grade, I don't remember my first kiss though.|`|UaJHq2vsaa	7th grade.  first kiss.. 8th|`|JQYuM4EDaa	7th grade and 7th grade ... i was stupid, i didnt exactly pick the best "first love" but w/e (:|`|VFQyC7Vlaa	9th grade and we kissed a week after we started dating, but we only saw each other on the weekends, so I guess we had only seen each other for 2 days before we kissed.|`|eCvm71URaa	first bf in 6th grade. im now in 7th grade. i havnt kissed a guy yet and im saving it for someone very special (:|`|iBxDIrjwaa	I was 18 yrs old and didn't kiss him, we only dated 2 months and I don't regret not kissing him. I want that first kiss to be special and with someone I love and spend rest of my life with. That's just me.
QrOJ8f7aaa	That's so sweet! It means that no matter how old you get, they will always love you the same. He wants to grow old with you!|`|AA12290249	he loves you. duh.    but congrats if that's you.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	That's pretty gay.|`|ij9N9r5waa	It means he's been reading again. Tell him to put down the poetry book and say whats in HIS heart.|`|PQu6OMulaa	It means he will love you forever and you mean everything to him(:  If your boyfriend said this to you..Im so jealous! Haha:D  Hope this helped!  XOXO|`|K2icX1Ozaa	it means he will love you forever  like theres no time limit|`|pG7OYpvbaa	God. I wish my boyfriend told me that.. But I think it means no matter how much time he spends with you he doesn't want it to end maybe? Sorry not to sure.|`|NVx3iRZJaa	He's telling you that he wants to be together forever and he's never thought about "what if we break up" .
JWW4bjxsaa	it's easier to assess situations from afar.  when you're trying to deal with your own situations, your personal feelings get involved and that's what sways decisions most of the time.|`|babb12e14085646eac7d48ba2fe6303aaa	when you are dealing with the problems faced by others then you try to give your best but rest all depends on the situation only. you are not 100% sure that the result will be positive.     but in your own case you want the result to be positive always and will not like to do anything that will mar your chances of getting a good or positive result out. therefore you are more likely to ask for help because you are not sure.|`|5O4kuA7Caa	ive noticed the same thing.
AiM31dMyaa	yes, try making her jealous<br>  <br>  that can work at times
sBMUXcAAaa	It's part of self control. You have sex with someone because you are married and have become one.   You don't have sex because you hope to be married, only to be dumped, made pregnant/get someone pregnant and given a STD.|`|0utZQuyeaa	Sex before marriage is a sin because it says so in the Bible. In one of the 10 Commandments, God said that sex is a gift for married people.  Therefore, you gotta obey that & if you don't its a sin.    Not everything that feels good is a sin! Define "everything."|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I was raised to be a Catholic.  I really don't know why, but the Church teaches us that sex is wrong before marriage and getting pregnant can be quite surprising because God gave us the freedom and we abused it.|`|sxo9dznQaa	Sex before marriage is a sin because Marriage is a sacrament that is suppose to make two people one person. And if you really think about it, sex is bad. Not everything that feels good is a sin. Doing good for someone else makes you feel good, and that's not a sin.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Because it prevents the whole "OMG I'm 15 and pregnant!"|`|kmAMgkiraa	Because God said so? Haha. We're not suppose to have all the answers but I know how hard it is to stay pure til marriage. And not all sin feels good. But following God does feel better. I don't know every time I get frustrated with things this video helps. The first minute or so I was kind of like what the heck this is nothing? But it gets good. Just watch please.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyheJ480L...

If this is the case keep him not to many of those ones left.|`|rKsgGHKkaa	Just do something! he'll be surprised but then u should explain that u want to do more with him.

hwNVpjKmaa	Funny you should ask. My mother has been married 9 times. I hooked her up with one of my teachers my Freshmen year of H.S. so I could possibly stay at the same school for all of high school. That H.S. was my 11th school growing up. He ended up being her 7th husband. She did stay with him 4 years but they divorced soon after I moved out. I haven't spoke with my mother in 5 years and it feels GREAT! I chose to have morals and values and she did not.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	no i have never tried. my parents would have felt pathetic and also wouldn't have liked it if i would have tried to set them up. plus both of my parents are pretty attractive and have no problem finding spouses.  i wouldnt recomend you try because your going to be looking at someone you like as a step mom or step dad and you wont be able to understand the needs that your parents have that spouses will have to fufill. i would just concentrate on your own love life and let your parents do the same. if there not out there trying to find someone then their obviously not ready|`|qSSiV0mmaa	No. My dad has no problem meeting women on his own.

rVsnBLfdaa	Why should you let your new boyfriend know about your sexual experiences with your ex.  Part of a new relationship is enjoying the experience with your new partner, it is the first time for the two of you.  The past is the past, get on with the new experience like it is a new experience.  Really l don't think you need to discuss it,|`|oxmkllnWaa	Hi,  give it up girl... he wants it... you like it at least somewhat... and you don't have to tell him all the details about the past.|`|kUZEYNmNaa	I think how your boyfriend reacts will tell you a lot about him. A lot of guys attach baggage to anal sex, they want to do it but they also think that women that do it are somehow slutty. They of course are just being blokes.    If your bf is a secure mature man then he won't have any problem with it and might even be glad of the fact that you know what you're doing.|`|5sHcB4wuaa	the next time he tries to put it off, get naked and bend over in front of him he wont resist
DcrI9zmkaa	No, it could also mean you have a huge pimple or that he has a fetish for staring.<br>  <br>  Seriously, you can't tell if someone likes you by looking *only* at whether they stare at you.<br>  <br>  Given your past history, he probably does like you since he *admits* he still has feelings for you.  <br>  <br>  The problem, however, is that a healthy relationship with him isn't likely.  Exes are exes for a reason.  Think about why the two of you broke up.  Has that situation changed?  If so, simply talk with him about the chance of you getting back together.  If not, you're better off moving on no matter how he feels.|`|EOsUmJw4aa	he is prob kicking himself at the fact that he got rid of you, show him what he is missing girl!!! and if he wants you, let him COME TO YOU!!!! REMEMBER: he broke up with you as there was no ''spark'', he has obviously had a change of mind, so let him do the running and you just step back and allow him to do this and enjoy the attention.|`|OYZDAyihaa	He most likely does, but if you don't like him back just ignore it and it will probably pass, but if he asks you out again, or says he likes you just tell him you don't feel the same way and then it will definitely pass.|`|og1CbIU3aa	aww, you're cute! of course he likes you! but let him make the first move, there's nothing you can do, just make eye contact and smile every now and then, but wait for him to approach you!|`|bo4LhtD4aa	no. you probably have a weird hairdo. or like spinach in your teeth. or maybe a boogy hangin around|`|PlDiJFi0aa	If he really likes you he will come to you.|`|05b8e574350cb9042ae48f65192c5811aa	maybe.<br>  or he likes to stare.<br>  ask him one day.<br>  like "why you always be lookinh at me, foo"<br>  lol.<br>  jk dont say it like that|`|vA5z3aPmaa	He is probably kicking himself in the *** for breaking up with you!! Be confiedent!!!<br>  Good luck|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	hard to tell!!|`|Rq2tMCQdaa	if you broke up with him, than he probably still has feelings for you. But it depends on how long it has been since the break-up. Feelings don't just go away overnight. Trust me on that one! :) Just give it time and it'll stop. Ask God for guidance :) Hope this helps!|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Yeah he probably still likes you, and he's having second thoughts about breaking up with you, maybe guilt about the way he did it or the reasons why. Just give it time and see what happens, not much you can do about it.|`|eQ1phaDXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|UOSrSEqHaa	It means you have a big old booger hanging out of your nose, just like in your avatar.|`|YFXusnT1aa	He misses what he lost
4KF4v3Dcaa	You need to have faith in yourself and tell yourself your gonna stop. Yes there are consequences to it but dont worry yourself sick, if its not making you happy you can have the ability to stop. Workout to distract yourself or something.  Your friends shouldnt be pressuring you, if you dont want to anymore they need to respect that. If they pressure u wen u wanna stop thats not right  Please believe in yourself! And to the guy that said its good once in a while, let me just say dont cuz once u stopped you should stop for good because each time you do it itll just make you feel worse and worse. People are different but idk (ive never done it). Sooo ya thats my advice, good luck! :)ull be fine|`|llgBLR6daa	you need to say no, walk away, and not care what they think of you afterwards. also maybe avoid or stop hanging around with the people who are pressuring you. find new friends, start get more involved with sports, concentrate on studying, etc. whatever it takes to prevent you from getting deeper into the habit-good luck|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just walk away.  I know that it is hard to control, but saying no may help you in the future.|`|5nQjGlkVaa	its called the emo influence..|`|K2icX1Ozaa	look to me there is nothing wrong with smoking weed once in a while but if u do it too much u can get hella messed up  you cant stop people from pressuring you but if you for real dont wanna smoke then dont cuz you know you dont have to if you dont feel like it|`|fCc1vqkNaa	i know its hard 2 say NO to people especially if ure a girl..  best solution is avoid friends like that..  theyre trying 2 spoil u...  n u should realise it..  learn 2 love urself n soon people will love and have some respect on u..  =)|`|aVs1mu3laa	I personally think your one of those people that makes our society what it is today. Basically your a useless tool who uses tax payers money to live in a trailer park. you need to grow up dear. As for your question, smoking will kill you. It will give you cancer and you will die. As for failing put a degree of effort into what you do and maybe in the end you will come out on top, as a decent person. Your 15 years old, your hormones will be racing, just rise above everyone else, they are the people you will look back on one day and laugh at because you tried and you are now successful.    As for your answer to my question dear, grow up. seriously. some of us have ACTUAL issues and dont need 15yo sh!t heads like you making the matter worse.|`|11VwVTYYaa	its called just say no. and walk away. its simple|`|CeoqmywVaa	you should be worried about what its doing to your body smoking kills!  But the only person that can stop it is you.  Your in control of your choices and actions and so if you feel its wrong and you sont want to..just say no.  It may seem hard if all your friends are doing it but trust me you dont want to end up old and addicted with sum sort of cancer because you didnt say no...:)|`|EklDkZ79aa	i want to say don't be worried  because you shouldn't    if you really want to stop then you would  :))

From what I can tell, I don't think she wants to go out with this guy, but she is probably hinting that she wants to go with you.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	you should just say "Hey, i would have gone w/ u." and see what she says|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Tell her darn it !!   Tell her that you were going to ask her but then so and so asked you.  If she doesn't want to go with him, go with you.  Simple.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Well she already said yes to this other guy so there is nothing for you to say to her.  It is all up to her to say she really does not want to go to the prom with him and wants to go with you instead.|`|ZPnPbnHpaa	talk to her about it. tell her you are there for her if she wants to go with you. u cant sound too desperate, but just let her know how you feel about her and that you would love to be her date. she would LOVE finding that out and even if she goes with the other guy, if she does not like him, she's ALL yours right after. Good Luck & I'm Here for you!|`|thzVWG1waa	step one find a good time to talk for both of you  step two make it obvious that you are serious about what ur talking about  step three make sure you both are at a level of understand, get straight to the point and lay down the facts  step four wait for her reply/answer  step five put the plan into action    basically, make sure she is aware of how you feel and that she understands ur feelings|`|11VwVTYYaa	just ask her. if she doesnt want to go with the other guy she is probably hinting that she wants to go with you as much as you want to go with her.
gvbK8VHgaa	what is your shoe size cause maybe the heels will fit you?   you should really ask her what the size of the heels are because they would go really well with that black mini you tried on the other day in your mums closet
f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Tell him to cool his jets.<br>  He totally overreacted. <br>  It's not like you slept with his best friend or something. Your phone fell and someone gave it back to you.|`|t1VthewCaa	What?!? I'm a little confused here! You dropped your phone, a girl picked it up and gave it back to you, your boyfriend snatched it from you and took it to maybe break it, and now you're on Y/A asking all of us what you should do about this obvious nut case! Do you really need us to say "dump him" or should we just save our breath because we know you won't take heed to it! I think I'll save my breath on this one!|`|2S2onP86aa	That is completely ridiculous. What the hell? Break it? What for? How old is he? <br>  <br>  Omg, this is way too stupid to even answer it. Tell him to grow up and give you your phone back. Or he should just go to an anger management and get a treat or something. <br>  <br>  How silly. I'm speechless.<br>  <br>  But good luck, hope that idiot doesn't break it for ya.|`|qMYhZSZdaa	Listen to all the other answers... they are all correct.....|`|0XbFBbqjaa	tell him if he doesn't give you your phone, you'll brake his face.... and how the hell did you let him just take your stuff, men don't like weak women, stand up for yourself and don't take that crap from anyone.

You should think long and hard about being with this guy. He has issues.
58OjH1Osaa	maybe she reacted like that because she doesn't have a boyfriend and you talking to her about yours is like rubbing it in her face.
PH1eFiqwaa	I met my husband when he ran out of gas on the side of the road and I stopped to help him.  He asked me how he could repay me, and I jokingly said, Marry Me. He asked me if I would like to get something to drink and it went from there. We were married 6 weeks later.  So it is never to late to get a bf or gf.  Just take your time and when it is right, you will know it.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	i met my bf at work, he started like 2 years after me, and we got together and then we both left the company lol|`|06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	Eventhough I have never had a girlfriend, the girls that I have gone out on dates with, I met them all online.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	I met my boyfriend in college.

H9pLICxSaa	if its too hard for you to be friends, take a little break from it, stop trying to hard to make it work and come back to it in a few days/weeks. it's hard to go from something more to back to friends instantly. it'll all get better in time. i'd also recommend coldplay.|`|U5KtVodYaa	i havent had that problem but when my girlfriend dumped me it helped me to listen to the album x&y by coldplay
BrH4HR7xaa	a girl did that???  that is completely disrespectful and you should tell her to stop saying mean things. if she's saying that, btw, it means she's insecure herself. which might mean she thinks you're better than her ;D  a good way to help this is to think about one thing that you LOVE about yourself, whether it be you can make people smile, your eyes, stomach, nose, you get along with people easily, anything! keep this in mind and embrace it. =)  also, i think it helps me sometimes when im feeling down is just to not look in the mirror as much. if you're feeling confident becuase you got an A on your test, or something like that, its not going to help you if you get all depressed again. try not to loko at yourself, and eventually you'll get over it. (hopefully that is.)  good luck! =) i'm sure you're a very beautiful girl. =)|`|lb4ADeRzaa	Well to be honest I never talk about ugly girls being ugly i talk  about once I'm jealous of.    answer mine? (its basically the same)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|G6x9SCWoaa	girl, your not alone.  the one person you should never lose faith in is yourself.  compliment yourself?  what do you like about yourself?  whenever you catch yourself thinking bad thoughts about yourself change them! would you EVER say that about ANYONE ELSE?  xo good luck!|`|4mOZFwpgaa	what do your family say about you?    you need confidence and you need character  you need to understand that looks dont matter that much  when it comes to getting a girl|`|hyRj4eIjaa	dont lose faith|`|YKKfq4p7aa	I used to have terrible confidence and was really akward. So I know how that feels!  I guess all I can really tell you is what I did to make myself feel better and hope it helps!  FIRST - put a mirror in your bedroom and prepare for the day in there. buy sticky notes and put one thing nice about yourself every morning (for example "I have nice clear skin" or "i have nice hands").  Also put a sticky note on it that says "I AM beautiful" even if you dont believe it. Post them around the edge of your mirror.  What that does is remind you everymorning of your good features and eventually you will just search for the posotive and not look for the negative. As cheesy as it may look it really does help.    SECOND - experiment with your looks! buy makeup to try on, get your haircut or dyed a diffrent way. A new fashionable outfit always boosts confidence, I am not joking. Keep yourself updated with your looks. It really helps. If you have acne get proactive or clearskin. If you have uneven skin tone, get concelar or tinted moisterizer for your skin to apply everyday!     You may feel ugly, but eveyone has something pretty about them.     And for that girl, she probably has confidence issues herself or is just someone you shouldn't communicate with anyways. I dont have a face book so I dont know if its possible...but if it is... block her. She is not worth it.    If you are bad at communicating or are shy, take little steps to work up your confidence.    smile at someone you dont know  wave to someone  start a conversation with someone  try out for a local play, etc.    hope this helps! i know it worked for me!
tvUAO4ioaa	You will most likely be sitting at a table with other people in the same boat as you - the significant others of the wedding party. They will all be feeling the same way.<br>  <br>   Through the ceremony, just be mesmerized by how hot your man looks in a tux.<br>  <br>  Through dinner, have a couple drinks and make small talk with the table. They may be fun/interesting/cool people. Don't be afraid to get the conversation started, ask what everyone does for a living or where they are from.<br>  <br>  Before you know it, you will be back at your bf's side.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	who told you you're expected to attend?  unless it's the bride and groom, you can't assume you're invited until your bf receives his invite in the mail.  they may not allow him a guest!  for whatever reason.  I went to a wedding last sept with my bf who was a groomsman and I didn't hardly know anyone there, but at least he was seated with me for dinner because the bride & groom had a sweetheart table instead of a head table.  I feel your pain, if you don't want to go and try to socialize with people you hardly know, then tell your bf you have other plans and don't go to the wedding.  but if you go you'll get to meet his friends, who you'll probably be hanging out with in the future, and that's a good thing.|`|paerqxfMaa	It will be fine, I'm sure by the time the wedding rolls around you will have met some of the other partners of others that are in the wedding party and you will all most likely sit together.  Go, have a wonderful time, let him do what he needs to do as a groomsman (pictures, dancing, etc) there'll be plenty of time for you both to enjoy the wedding together.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	Could you possibly bring a friend with you? I mean I know that adds to the guest list but maybe it could be a possibility.<br>  <br>  If not, I agree with some of these people, that you will probably be sitting at the table with people in the same boat as you. So, just enjoy a free meal and try and be social for one night.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	I'm going to be in your situation soon, and not looking forward to it. Please tell me how you got through it.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	You are required to be there since you are his serious girlfriend and he is in the wedding party.  However, don't be so shy.  You're allowed to go to the cocktail hour with your boyfriend and talk to your boyfriend before and during dinner.  Hopefully during that time you will be introduced around the table and strike up some conversation with other people sitting at the table.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should get together with the husband and wife to be and your boyfriend and have some dinner.  You can get to know the husband and wife to be and become friends with them and not feel so alone at the wedding.  It wouldn't be awkward for your boyfriend to get together with his friend whose getting married and bring his girlfriend along.  That's totally acceptable.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	No, you don't need to be present at the reception.  You are not required to be there in any way shape or form.  It would be nice if you could suck up your uncomfortableness and be there for him and his friends on their special day.  I'm sure you can be charming and sociable for one afternoon/evening with strangers.|`|urkNRr5Kaa	It's often expected to go to a wedding with a date.  I suppose that the other people in the wedding will have a date.  So, if your bf shows up without a date that could look odd.  But, you aren't required to by any means.  But, if I were you I'd probably go and show my support to him and to his friend.  It shows you are taking in an interest in his life and his friend's life.  That should only make him happy.  Who knows?  You'll probably make friends with people in the wedding there.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I think this is a great oppurtunity for you to impress his friends! You should show up looking stunning. Be polite and talk to everyone and enjoy the wedding. This will not only impress his friends but may help him to hurry to want to marry you!|`|W7kSSgRoaa	You should go.  Some day you may ask him to be your date at a wedding where he doesn't know anybody.  When that day comes, you'll be glad you went to this wedding.  ...unless you enjoy going to weddings without a date but not single.
wXVzRXxFaa	thats really good!!

You sound young though. It almost sounds like you are trying to make your voice higher than normal. I think you definitely have potential. Maybe a little nasally too. Definitely better than I could sing though! Good job.    ---I love it when people say will chose best answer or easy best answer then...never chose one! Its kinda funny.|`|kZWKdPtOaa	Nice song... Little girl should be on some kind of commercial. She sounds like she's 6. She is 6?

kcbEWzYwaa	Honestly I wouldn't go back in the room with her. However if you absolutely have to go back in the room with her, maybe bring some salt and pepper and lay on the top of the desk so that your prepared.|`|nyeUUojFaa	wow sounds pretty intense.       and IMMATURE.|`|mz0RCtfXaa	yea!!!!|`|lpgdP3Gdaa	i hope you're kidding, stop being an e-liar|`|NIwMSioZaa	u can sue her for biting u and throw like a hand full of eraser and run run for ur life|`|OcANsWOnaa	Are you for real? I am not sure I really believe this story... but I'll try and answer your questions anyway. I mean, why not?    If your teacher is trying to eat you... that teacher has serious issues. Get out of that school, call a counselor, do something. I am not sure how to defend yourself with an eraser (maybe throw it at her) but you shouldn't eat yourself. That would be awkward. Oh, and don't go i or under the esk. Throw the desk at her.|`|OiLNogtEaa	If you are being serious then tell your mom and get that hoe fired.      If by "she ate me" you mean she tried to eat you up *wink wink* then eat her up *wink wink* (only if she's hot and if you're into girls)|`|ilcu3WGdaa	LOL!!  i seriously agree with kyoru!!   still,, ROFLMAO!!! hahahahaha!!!!    
7VMLssSnaa	Haha.  Um just tell her you only like her as a friend. and if you want to tell her to f**k off, do it. it'll teach her a lesson not to bother the living crap outta people.|`|w7UG1niYaa	I would be straight up with her.  She's obviously invading your personal space.  It's reversed sexual harassment.  But don't call it that.  It sounds odd coming from a  guy no matter what.  Anyways, I'll explain this from both sides of the token.  She DEFINITELY has issues.  Duh.  She might be lonely and she might not know how to interact with people.  I was once like that.  But that was because I was being raised by a controlling and abusive father.  My mom was powerless.  Back to you.  Tell her that you don't feel comfortable with her behavior, that's its disrespectful to you and that it's invading your personal space.  Be honest.  Tell her that you don't see her as more than an acquaintance.  Tell her that you are not interested in going to the dance with her.  Politely ask her to leave you alone.  And I agree with you, she's freaking creepy.  Good luck man!|`|Big1WNMRaa	she sounds like a creepy lesbian. i'm nott against lesbians or anything like that. i'm just saying.|`|rR0rPVAEaa	Simply get a new look and act different then she won't like you. Don't hurt her by saying something to her. XD|`|Oh2wVMkyaa	well, if someone is touching you somewhere you dont want to be touched then you should always stand up and tell her to stop. and if she is annoying tell her this," look i understand that you like me or like being around me but i kind of need my space." and tell her in front of a bunch of people so that if you piss her off then she cant make up any lies about you cus there were people around to hear.|`|RLA8FVu7aa	tell her straight up im not intrested and i dont feel comfortable with you
Oafj48Zxaa	Well, this is sweet. If you guys know each other well there should be plenty to talk about, games, shows, movies... You know. But if you don't know each other so well, take this time to get to know each other better. I'm sure you guys enjoy spending time together so that should be great. If his ex is still in the picture hates you, she's just jealous that she doesn't have him. Tell her to grow up and move on with life, he IS with you for a reason! His friends will like you just be you! Kissing, ahh, the best part! The moment will come! Just have fun!|`|Ri27AKdHaa	1. Then just b nice to um u cant change them.  2.Then egnore her but dont be rude just try to be friends cus I mean he oviously likes you.  3.Then invited him to a movie alone or to your house  4. ask him his faveorites like hobby sport and what I do is im like so how far would you go with me unless he is a goody good  5. BE YOUR SELF!! nothing more or less|`|ydE9DY9maa	i've never had a boyfriend, but i would just say dont worry about all that stuff!! who cares if his ex, or his friends dont like you? if YOU like each other, than that's all that matters! talk about what you have in common, since you've known each other for a while it seems, you should have plenty to talk about.    most importantly, dont be anyone but yourself.    hope that helps! and i wont be offended if you want advice from someone who's actually been in a relationship before :)|`|w7UG1niYaa	I wouldn't worry about his friends.  Make an effort to be nice, but if they aren't nice back, then don't worry about it.  Not your problem.    If his ex hangs around, talk to your man about it if it makes you uncomfortable.  Don't beat around the bush, it builds anger.  Monitor their behavior, make sure he is totally over her and all about you.    yes, you want your first kiss in private.  Movie theaters are fun, during the previews.  You have less pressure and its way more romantic.  It gives you a chance to be spontaneous as well.  Just pop a kiss.      Take things slow and really get to know one another.   Don't rush into the physical until you are sure and COMFORTABLE.      Good luck!|`|Az9keOz5aa	Well,if his friends don't like you,ask them why,or just hang around them a lot,try and figure out what they like,then buy it for them,or just try to get to know them better,butter them up! And if his ex hangs around try to get to know her too,see if she still has feelings for him,but if she doesn't keep an eye on him,but not too much or too closely,cuz them he'll feel like  he is getting smothered by you. And maybe kiss him when he drops you off at ur house,vise versa. And some good things to talk about......hmmmm,just ask him what kind of stuff he likes to do,talk about him,not urself unless he wants to know all about you. Hope this helped!|`|zwdGBrUZaa	if his friends don't like you, thats ok, as long as he does right? if their his real friends they'll cope with it  if his ex hangs around first tell him that you trust him and if she does things that look bad, just tell her to stop, but if you bf isnt doing anything in response to her theres nothing to worry about, but if he does u need to talk to him  if he wants to kiss in private let him, but dnt do things ur not ready for  things to talk about are what you like about, what you guys r gonna do in the weekend, school, people, family  good advice, dnt be clingy or needy
tO8ey3o8aa	ur a normal teen but i would calm it down so that if u find one girl that u like she wont be turned off by ur reputation|`|AnRxCLZXaa	i don't think you're a man ****, but what you did at those two parties was way unappealing|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	I don't think so because you were just having fun.|`|O1WxKk7uaa	no you were just playing a game everyone else did it so there nothing wrong|`|aKXtm3tfaa	no that just makes u every high school boys role model|`|Ank2v7E8aa	i'm in 11th grade too so i've seen this happen many times...in fact i did it too before i got a boyfriend.    don't worry...i mean you might be the topic of conversation around school for a while but people forget and move on.  if you didn't like what you did with those girls and you're not going to continuously hook up with girls then this will be forgotten. but if you continue, you will get a reputation.    as of now...you'll be ok. go to a few more parties and don't do this and you'll be fine.|`|ksrZqdFHaa	if you want to think so...ps, the definitition of a **** usually includes sex.|`|LOL5x6FGaa	no it makes u a perv lol;)?|`|hPDKIm9waa	well, aren't you just the coolest person ever.    *rolls eyes*|`|yJTaBGoEaa	No this doesn't make you a man whore.

zzaScg0haa	Follow your heart and go for the guy it leads you to
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Anyone you want.  Always the bridesmaids are invited but usually all your girlfriends, fiance's sisters, etc.  I know mine had one guy I'd asked if he minded being DD, and my sister invited one of her friends.  I don't have too many girl friends and several of the ones I do have weren't able to be there yet (as they were flying in for the wedding the day before and the bach party was a week early).    It really depends on the style of bach party you are having.  My cousin had a spa day and only invited her 2 FSIL, her MIL and her mom.  If you are bar hopping and getting wild, you'll want to stick with people close to you in age.|`|S9jyc95jaa	I would guess bridesmaids and close girl friends.
OGpLZK88aa	Usually close friends and sisters of the bride.  If the bride is especially close with her mother, any aunts,.. they are also sometimes invited (this typically only occurs if there will be no strippers)  Since guests do not bring gifts to a bachelorette party, it is acceptable to invite girls not invited to the wedding.  This often occurs if the guest list is limited or if it is a destination wedding.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	your bridesmaids and closet friends& family(women)|`|wvhoS7WDaa	well here are some free stuff    http://bacheloretteplanners.com/|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Anyone the bachelorette would like to have invited.

It is suppose to be a very intimate gathering.|`|F7O0nLK1aa	everyone who knows how to have fun.
dzbblpjgaa	Firstly - well done for preparing to go hungry. I think you may be given a small offering of rice or something relative to what you may have as a ration within a poor household, or maybe not. You will have water and could survive on just this for several days. Perhaps a meal of pasta or high GI food that will keep up your sugar levels and some protein. This last meal before hand would only last up to about 5 hours and a 30 hour stint is beyond anything I have heard of, usually 24hrs. So you will feel hungry and perhaps a bit more emotional than usual and possibly dizzy.<br>  <br>  I hope you raise good money and equally important awareness of these peoples plight. Travelling to these places in a gap year or as a volunteer could not be recommended more. I did not travel properly until later in life and felt I could have been more useful. Be guided to a country you wish to help - you will not regret it.|`|KEAfTavqaa	Just eat regular. You can take oatmeal with you. How can I help?
AA10250756	Tell them you're not ready for a one person relationship and you want to date other people or whatever else is the truth.
4HDhjmJDaa	It's different for every person. But seriously, if you think that it's okay to have sex after only one night with someone, you are definitely not ready to have sex. Sex is a physical expression of love, and love takes time to grow and develop. Think about the repercussions before falling into bed.|`|uRvwLkIBaa	Do it asap.  As soon as ur mate is ready to receive.|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Longer than a month.|`|oTEYvL7oaa	it depends on when yall think its the right time, but i think you should wait at least 3 months|`|vfL3Wo7raa	u should wait til YOUR ready and not sooner.
4drQ38qZaa	You hear it from other people. But other then that you must test them out.|`|Bngsrgpgaa	Watch them kiss somebody else...?    Lmao, nah. That's silly.... is it?|`|yPAdMJbDaa	you just gotta test them out and see.
rh12tX8Naa	Sex makes a relationship very strong, but it's not the most important thing in it. I think couples who never have sex build up sexual frustration and they take it out on each other by fighting. I know that i'd be very disappointed if we never had sex and i would probably either break it off or cheat on him. (I have never cheated and i'm totally against it, but if my partner knows that i want some and he still doesn't give it to me, i'm going somewhere else. I seem to find nothing but bed freaks so hopefully i never have to experience it.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	for me no way but idk every ones different. but i do know that sex is part of human nature and its a sense of closeness and it is intimate passionate love!|`|JWW4bjxsaa	i have taken a semester of psychology, and in there my professor always defined asexual and not being attracted to any sex, so wouldnt dating an asexual be a lie in itself if they're not attracted to any one person?    but of course sex is an important part of a relationship, when you're mature and old enough to handle it.  it's about experiencing that person on a more intimate and personal level, and it can either strengthen a tie or break it.  you can still have a relationship without sex, but when it becomes serious you'll always be lacking that one intimate thing.
8YfYh3y0aa	My goodness!   .   You know.....it's better to not play games with peoples heads.  You don't like games, do you?   Well, other peoples don't like games either.  So my advice, try to be kinder to people.  If you don't need them, you don't have to prove it.....just be cool to them.  Respect is all about being cool at the right time.  It's tough to do when you little.
OG3lycSPaa	you could ask him if he has a girlfriend and then look shocked and tell him he is really cute, you don't know why he doesn't have one. And then you can ask him if he is shocked that you are single. But I would avoid approaching him when there is people around because it could embarrass him a little.
H7v497GGaa	you should just start talking to him in a friendly way.  or start talking to one of his friends to get to him|`|LWpUjTHmaa	Does your friend Ryle know him? If she does hang out with her when that guy's around and ask Ryle to introduce you to him.
22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	I had a similar problem, but I kept it away from my boyfriend.   This guy who was bugging me was like 24, but just started university (6 years older than me)...he is like short as me and scrawny.   He asked me out a few times and I told him that I have a boyfriend. He kept asking me about things I do with my BF, but I ignored him and didn't answer. Once we went to the movies (as friends, with other people and he put his arm around me...and obviously i pushed him away. Jackass.    Anyway, I just kept ignoring him...told him I am busy when I wasn't and just kept my distance. Especially after the movie incident, i just never bothered to talk to him. he would message me or approach me and I never replied or just walked away. i think he got the message.   If this worked for me, I think it might work for your GF too.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	report it to the cops and get a restraining order, they will block all phone calls and messages from the phone number, and if he does come around call the police and they will arrest him|`|BcSZ4Jidaa	Tell her to be straight forward with him, tell him to leave her alone, period. If that doesnt work then you tell him or get a court order.|`|iDpWtJTraa	Wow. This blew me away when I heard this. I'm telling you this as a Concerned Civilian.Go and call the cop's. Stalking is Illegal and as long as you both know him and who he is, you can tell the cops everything and they can deal with it. I'm serious, get together with your GirlFriend and call the Police.|`|3OWV6Wkfaa	Call him and tell him that hes creeping ur gf out|`|PgIbB8tXaa	Why don't you just call him and talk to him? Tell him you and your girlfriend are serious and you see why he likes her because she's a great girl but that he should back off as she has asked.  If he doesn't understand this then you are able to get a bit angrier.|`|qoS9SLgQaa	i have a cyber stalker so i killed her lol j/k but i want to|`|na9nG47zaa	call the police. its illegal and you know who it is. This could be a serious danger to yall
mYAbq6fnaa	well first of all, im really sorry. i know that that is a tough thing to go through, which i know through family members. i couldnt even imagine losing my best friend. just try to talk to your parents or a counselor or someone about it to try to let go. your always going to miss her, and theres nothing you can do about that.

qAfnWKQCaa	We men have needs. You women have emotional needs, we men have sexual needs. We sneak around because most women think its evil that we men have those needs. We sneak around for your sake, not our own. Also because we dont feel comfortable doing it around other guys. And we really don't care if our girlfriends look at porn, its actually kind of cool.    Oh, guy below me,  Sex is a natural meaningless urge. Sex has nothing to do with love or emotion. The only purpose of sex is fun and procreation. Sex has about as much to do with feelings as eating, drinking, and sleeping.|`|GQfQ0TsDaa	well not ALL men watch porn, though most of the majority do. I for one don't. I guess they're sneaky cause they have that small little guilty feeling. :P|`|op4gBJRJaa	People watch porn discreetly because if they know they are being watched or someone knows they are doing it they may feel uncomfortable, the point of watching porn and masturbating is release stress and make you more comfortable, sometimes people just watch porn because they love it or they have relationship problems, or are going through stress and need to release it.|`|PJM71Izjaa	they sneak around because they don't wanna seem like pigs and they'd probably get penalized for it.|`|kEeUsdnYaa	Men watch porn because on a deeper level they feel that they could not have sex with such women because they are not capable of attracting that kind of woman (in terms of looks).    many guys will deny this but its true.    They also find it exciting because men are visual (primarily) when it comes to attraction.    Think if it like this: if a woman wanted to, she could get laid any day of the week - she would just need to find a guy that will jump anything with a skirt.  There are plenty of guys like that these days.    Women dont find porn as "great" as most guys because they on a deeper level KNOW that they could get sex Easily.    Nont only this, but attraction in women is primarily a personality thing (to be very BRIEF, its very complicated.)    Overall, porn is bad for either group because it demeans what sex is about.

Maybe you just haven't found a girl that likes you that way, get to know girls and don't hold back, let your personality show a little more, find girls that are interested in the same things you are.|`|AA12220250	You need to go out to bars or having a great time. what i did was i got a okcupid account. its how i got my gf. www.okcupid.com. no joke.

Anyway the "tall, dark piercing eyes,big somewhat buff, honor student, school scholar may intimidate a few girls. Honestly growing out your buzzcut a little may also help cause most girls find longer hair attractive. Just don't give up. "I'm good looking and a great person" just make sure you're not too cocky.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	you have good morals, high standards, and know what you deserve.|`|aKXtm3tfaa	sadly,girls want the weed/alcohol guys that will **** em|`|Dd6KcpjEaa	THIS is why you cant get a girlfriend be confident in yourself and it will happen soon|`|60NJNjEpaa	i'm beginning to think that it's just timing.  these things take time, and when the time is right, someone will discover how much of a catch you are.      sounds like you're easy on the eyes... just wish you were 10 years older. :)    g'luck!|`|tP2lPrH9aa	I dont know? btw dont listen to the people telling you do drugs and drink.

There's nothing to figure out pretty much...once you go to college you'll have to fight girls off ! =) Highschool is not the place you want to find a gf!!! So enjoy being 18 and being single!!!|`|UCKAiLN1aa	You're probably above all those hs girls. Wait till college where girls are a bit more serious (hopefully) and you have a wider range girls for friends or dates.|`|gGsWTRAOaa	um i dont really know,i know ur just explainging urself but it sounds a wee bit selfish or conceited,just give it time it will all come together|`|3rxzsxHTaa	It's the buzz cut.|`|LaUouVtfaa	"I've never smoked weed, cigarettes, done an illegal drug, or even drank alcohol."    That's why.   Partying = getting laid|`|0SoglbRUaa	Your time will come. not everyone gets asked out.  just because you never have been asked out doenst mean you never will. someone is out there for everyone and you just need to wait for your chance.  dont get mad or jealous.  its just a matter of time.  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|eWEd53GTaa	its cause u have no life thats why u ask questions like these on yahoo instead of goinf to strip clubs like every other senoir|`|PYIHDmAiaa	casue ur probably going4 the girls that only like druggies! i bet u that 1of ur bestfriends like you. and just dont act despriate!|`|wpbN9ynEaa	it isn't that hard to get along with girls|`|Z5Gs9bIDaa	some people go for the bad boys but id rather go for the good, you sound like a guy who wants a true relationship which is hard to find, idk why no one asked you out, you sound awsome unlike the **** heads in my highschool haha but thats life, maybe you will find that special some one in collage idk but i  wish there were more doods like you hahah good luck|`|50X6ZcTJaa	so sorry to hear about that.  i hope these things might help  1st- youve got to loosen up be more of a ladies man  2nd- dont rush in to a relationship because most girls would think youre desperate   3nd- if these dont work go to eharmony.com you'll find someone someday.  good luck!!!|`|X2mVl3XQaa	chin up and be strong you will find the right woman for you sooner than you might think! maybe you can go to church and get closser to GOD so you would understand your life better...or juss keep tryin n never give up!|`|Zta4vVqjaa	A lot of people are like that. My boyfriend doesn't care about looks and neither do I. If you are saying that your good looking then most people are going to think that you only think about yourself and nothing else. Try to be more caring about others. I say your a great guy just by what you're saying but I think you should focus on your feelings and between the girls. If you have fights with the girls and another girl sees it... it will look like you like to start fights with girls. Which makes it seem like you hate them and all you want to do is fight. Just be nice and if they try to start up a fight walk out of it, don't get deeper in it. Hope I helped!|`|3JaMajzLaa	idk i have the same problem im tall and smart and a good person   most older people say do you model and wow your gorgeous but some guys might think im too aggressive and mean cuz im tall?  it really sucks............im native american scottish german and french but mainly native american  maybe thats it   but my brother seems to have no problem whatsoever   sorry i really have no clue i feel your pain though   im am musical, smart, love to laugh, i play sports, and im a christian but nobody has any interest in me idk|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	You're too serious and mature.  And you're not interested in drugs and alcohol, like they are.  Too good for them.|`|S5ru2Yciaa	First off you probably rely on your grades, looks and stuff to carry you through    that stuff plays a role but how you interact with the girls  plays a BIGGER role  if girls try to instigate fights then you must say wrong things or something  cuz most girls are happy to talk but if you start talking about werid stuff or somethig offensive or yourself all the time then thats a BIG turn off      have fun when talking to them also helps dont go in looking for a date  just do it because you genrally want to have a fun convo and things should go good|`|osZyNSRLaa	your mom did what to the cow????|`|YtfFQejbaa	wow  u sound really sweet and i don't get it  i would probably date u  mayb ur 2 nice or something?  a push over?  girls like bad boys..  haha at least i do...|`|fFgd8mMJaa	attach a picture and ill let you know|`|lkwQD1cdaa	try asking people ... maybe its your attitude toward the girls? cause some guys i know are like that... they get all fidgety around us girls and act really stupid and dumb lol    so my advice is to ask some girls about youself or something lol   different people have different opinions :P|`|91D2cLEraa	from what im hearing do you even have time for a girlfriend?|`|0QT269rOaa	The way you come off in this question is a little arrogant, although not intolerable.  Your appearance sounds a bit intimidating.  I don't know...this isn't a question for the internet.  It could be that you just have a bad aura about you that turns girls off.  Who knows?!  You should somehow ask people this in person - people who don't know you, maybe go speed-dating just to get some honest feedback.  Good luck to you!|`|541706a8fdfa283a86f620e73dd1d9b2aa	possibly you need to be a bit more humble....you may be coming across as elitist and self absorbed to other people. Watch your body language especially....you may need some coaching in this area. 90% of communication is non-verbal. Good Luck you sound like a good guy|`|ND5KncX0aa	Do you talk alot? Are you a know it all? You need to listen to girls, let them talk.  You seem like a nice guy, but also a bit of an overachiever and no one really wants to feel belittled or talked down to.  So forget about trying to impress anyone, and stop worrying about not having a girlfriend.  The right person will come into your life when you least expect it.|`|Qn79zsMmaa	i want some girl that is dating some guy who sounds like a 5 yr old im 11 he's 12 she's 11 i sound like a 18 yr. old so i guess just if you see a girl you like just try to be her friend then try to date her don't just walk up and say "hey your hot you want to go out?"  cause you'll sound like a dumb @ss    wow i just read the whole question and you sound like a older version of me only differnce is the hair and the height i have rock star hair is ur last name Metz or Pico? maybe Sing?

If you know he hasn't you can try contacting him, but I feel that if you got back together it would be for the wrong reason, at least for him.  If I wanted somebody I would be chasing them.  If I'm over them I let them go.  Sometimes the best thing we can get out of a relationship is the memories.  Cherish them for now, for they will probably be replaced with others in due time.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	First, you need to try being he's friend so you can learn him again!!<br>  Then, let him know that you still have feelings for him, and see if he feels the same!!|`|ryS23sNBaa	go somewhere but not a date spot.<br>  just have fun<br>  <br>  but let him know.<br>  lifes too short to never see your love again<br>  <br>  but if there are underlying issues that are still unresolved. brining them back up will not be good

Don't lie to him because chances are he will end up hearing rumors about the real reason why you broke up with him. Just be honest..|`|tqEpUIxpaa	ok well do it nicely because it has been a year it might not be easy for him tell him that you want to be friends and that hes a great person make him feel special try not hurting his feelings after the break up message him and tel him that you are sorry if you have hurt his feelings try to be nice until he gets over you it works ive done it before and Wear great friends now
AA11263103	what ever ones it fits on.  good luck!!
1Lc2L3qvaa	If you really love him stay and it just may be too soon for him if he is younger than you.and besides if you are older and bit more mature he may think hes a bit imperfect or if you're younger and hes older you may be just too excited! If you wanna split up I would say go for it!but don't hook up too soon with someone!my advice is just stay calm and wait a bit who knows? maybe he'll ask!!!!! so stay calm and relax and he just may ask you :) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|3SSVBJAqaa	What is this? 1909, or 2009? Why don't you ask him for his hand in marriage?|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you just bought a house together.  do you understand the financial situation you have gotten your self into?<br>  <br>  men like to deal with one financial thing at a time.  if you just bought the house or bought it anytime within the last several months, theres probably still paperwork and whatnot, and he probably wants to get a few mortgage payments out of the way, so he can take a look at how they will affect you guys month to month for sure, before he has to go look at what payments on an engagment ring would be<br>  <br>    i dont understand how many women get worked up over stuff like this.  debt is not a smart way to start an engagement or marraige.  wait till the house situation has settled down, you guys are financially stable, and THEN start thinking about a ring.<br>  <br>  they did a study.  if i could ever find it, id post it on every question like this that i found.  the average guy waits six years, 7 months, and some odd days to propose.  they want complete financial, emotional, and social stability to make sure they can handle an engagement/wedding.   if anything, waiting to propose is helping you guys cause he is making sure you dont get completly ****** up the *** by bills|`|P9oP8CS9aa	If you're living together doing married things, making long term plans. You bought a house, want kids and don't see a end to this, why is a piece of paper going to destroy this happiness.I would leave if I was very unhappy, but having expectations that will change the dynamics of my relationship is another issue.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	You need to ask him those questions!  How old are you?  He may just be scared.  Talk it out with him and then decide from that point if you think he ever will want to marry you-- and if you are willing to wait if he does...|`|AA11380378	Tell him flat out: I would love to have children, of course! once we are married, not before.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Why wait for him? Tell him what you want.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	You let him have his cake and eat it too.  When you have kids with someone and move into a house with them and already share a life with them, you have all the perks of being married.  He has no motivation to want to put a ring on your finger or marry you because you're already having sex, you're already raising kids, you already live together, and you already have a life and a future together.  There's nothing left except a few legal rights that come along with marriage.  <br>  <br>  He has everything a marriage is going to give him without having to say he's married and that's every man's dream.  You shouldn't make this much of a life with someone if you want to have that romantic proposal and marriage one day.<br>  <br>  You should talk to him about how you feel.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	Sorry, but why did you buy a house with him when you're questioning the status of your relationship? He probably likes things the way they are...Marriage is a huge step and maybe he just feels he's not ready yet? ...I won't tell you to leave him, but you do need to tell him how you feel and see what he has to say. You want a man to marry you because he wants to, not because you forced him to, so don't  try to 'corner' him into marrying you unless you are willing to put everything on the line with your relationship. Only you know if not getting that marriage proposal is worth staying or splitting up. Go talk to him!|`|AA10351134	Only you know your boyfriend and can answer this question. Just pause a second, chill, and give him the benefit of the doubt. Is he generally a straight-up guy, considerate, honest? Then you need to have a heart-to-heart and let him know that the actual married part is really important to you, and see what his feelings are.<br>  <br>  But there are other guys who would pretend to want children, etc. -- just feeding you back what you want -- to keep the status quo. I'm sure you know by now which type of guy you have. It makes a difference.|`|tX27e0UFaa	you have to give him time and no pressure. Its only been 3 years and maybe he isnt ready. Remeber a wedding means a life long bond between two people... forever, no more flavors of ice cream, just yours. Are you ready to be married? You could be ready for a wedding and all that fun stuff but marriage is hard work and very stressful. Good luck :-)|`|AUsvrW8faa	Leave.  Remember the 4 F's.

Give him the ultimatum, either get married or get out. Right now he's playing you.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Whats the rush for the ring?<br>  <br>  Enjoy what you have. Most people would kill for that..|`|AA10973353	Why are you asking us??  Don't you think he'd be better suited to answer your question??|`|wma3cn1Haa	You should stay! Don't leave him but I would try to let him know that you are extremely ready for this. Besides marriage isn't the bond that keeps you and your love together...its well you're love for each other. So be glad that you two are there for each other. Let the love flow its course. He'll give you the ring when he feels that you two are ready to be bound permanently.|`|qmsgEJIwaa	Well first of all you should not have moved in with him if you wanted to get married. I wouldn't have kids with him until you are married. What does he want....to have children with you and then expect you to give your kids his last name. If he buys a home with you and now wants kids tell him you want to make it all official or it's a no go. He should be begging for your hand in marriage. Hope it works out for you. Just talk to him and tell him how you feel. Sometimes you have to spell it out for men and you never know he might turn out to be a sweetie. Good luck.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Why should he marry you when you are giving him all the benefits of marriage w/o actually being married?  The ONLY thing you have left to bargain with is children.  Tell him if he wants children then you INSIST that you get married.  Then make sure your on a reliable form of birth control that he can't mess with.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	Realize that it's a big commitment for him and it looks daunting.

Life is easier without commitment.  You might be setting yourself up for a fall.  Talk about it with him.  You could say, ok you said you want to marry me, so I started the process.  If he doesn't come across, then you know the score.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	You just need to ask him upfront. On what does he want. <br>  Tell him you are not having his kids until you get married. <br>  Do leave him yet, get your answer first from him then do what you have to do.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	Why would you leave if you love him? I think, if you truly love him then you should talk to him about wanting to get married and engaged by a particular time.|`|24a0caf47c1c1686342d550d49ab66b6aa	What's your rush?  You have the rest of your life to be miserable and married, just have fun with him, it'll happen eventually.|`|8CXotQVVaa	u should just talk to him about it. u really should be married.

Hopefully he will ask soon :)|`|y2nC8BUGaa	The next time he says he wants to marry you ask him straight up, "so what are you waiting for?"|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Tell him you need to know where things are going.

You've been together for 3 years! You even LIVE together! Why in the world are you not married yet?<br>  <br>  If he takes too long to make the decision, then you need to let him go. If he doesn't want to get married, then I guess he's not the guy you've been looking for or the guy you deserve.<br>  <br>  Tell him that if he's ready to father children with you then he's ready to get married to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	3 yrs, these days isnt long enough to get married. i was with someone for 5 yrs, 3 yrs, etc etc and im still single and 35.  your trying to speed up time, slow down and enjoy the life you have now. one day you will look back and wish it was now.

Leave it at that.|`|cm4fXQLeaa	maybe he likes you. and doesn't want to go to prom with a girl who is taken and start drama.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	....if you have a boyfriend, why aren't you asking him to take you, or wondering why he hasn't asked you yet, or wondering how he'll react to someone else taking you to prom?<br>  <br>  Generally, "boyfriend" means "exclusive dating".  I'm confused myself why your friend would ask you to go if you have a boyfriend; and why you have a boyfriend if you'd go dating your best friend.  This might be what his father is worrying about, or it might be that your boyfriend has stepped in and said something to your friend, or it might be a lame excuse, I don't know.|`|tpFTpTWCaa	I don't think it's a lame excuse. But, I do think it's lame that his father is like that. I went to my senior ball with my best guy friend. My dad is against guys. Well, during the time in HS he was. Now, I am married and there is nothing he can do about that. He can always tell his dad you aren't seeing the guy anymore...but that'd be a lie. Idk.|`|QZwECo1Baa	sounds fishy to me.  He is hiding something.  But then again, the sky is gloomy today, starting to rain...and I got the blues):|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	in a way i think because you have a boyfriend....<br>  why cant your boyfriend take you anyways??<br>  well good luck !|`|bzfXbM4raa	Could be both...either way...why aren't you going to your prom with your bf?  Why him instead?|`|4HXRmTVvaa	this exact thing happened to me. it's probably because he is in love with you and cannot face the fact that you are taken. to girls, it's definitely possible to have a best guy friend, but for guys, because you're so close, he's probably really frustrated that you can't be more than just friends. it's not his dad. no way. my best guy friend told me weeks before our prom that he couldn't take me because I had a boyfriend and it wasn't fair for him. he has feelings for you, absolutely. during prom he's going to be watching you dance with your boyfriend and he's probably going to act a little bit jealous and rude. don't take it personally.|`|x90ETSsaaa	I think it's his Dad mine would do the same thing (well to my brother). Prom night is the night guys are hopen to get laid. His dad just doesnt want anything to go down after knowing you have a boyfriend.|`|xJyEhiHeaa	i think its a lame excuse srry but you can still go with someone else i hope :)|`|3DMdfprLaa	lame exuse every parent lets there kids go to prom and if they well there messed up|`|7jlSKRXBaa	a lame excuse sos bbe xx
M8tAFRc9aa	You can't ever really be "Just Friends" with a guy unless he's Gay     trust me one of my best friends is a girl but I always have feelings for her.

AA11607503	It looks like you need to be blunt with him that you did a shady and cowardly thing by having your sister break up with him.  I don't really blame him for still being a little thrown off and irritated by you.  Drop a sorry and that you made a mistake not only the sister thing, but also calling off the relationship.  Be honest that you like him and would love to have him give you another chance... If he doesn't you have to respect that and give him the space that he needs.  Hope that helps you out.

If not, I would invite him over again & have a nice convo & then say what do you tend to do when you like a girl. This is sorta to let him know where you're going with this. Then whenever he tells you, tell him you always giggle & that's why you've been doing it a lot lately. and then if he still doesn't get you like him, just tell him. The worst he can say is no. Don't be scared! You'll be surprised by the outcome, especially if he says yes! Good luck!

Because all women only have x (girl) chromosomes and men have x (girl)  and y (boy)chromosomes, what you will give birth to depends on if the babys father tends to be more masculine or more feminine.  So when a guy says something to his wife like  "She couldn't give me a son" it actually has nothing to do with her, it is him who coulnd't give her the Y chromosome necessary to create a boy because the Y's in his sperm werent strong enough. Women dont have the Y to make a boy the man has to give it to her.  So far from what I've seen it's pretty accurate.  I have one brother who is total macho man, he has 3 boys, I have another brother who is manly but generally inside he is a very sensitive caring person which some would consider a female trait, and he has 2 girls and 1 boy.  If you ever truly analyze a man and his offspring you can see it makes sense most of the time...|`|H4bYFqwPaa	who's god? and how does he know what he is impregnating into a woman?

Sprayed the silver and made a white flag with the table numbers using numerical stickers in a pretty font.... <br>  <br>     I would be a shame to not use some sort of castle theme in your reception... It would be "classy" and still whimsical...<br>  <br>     Another friend of mine that got married... They didn't have flower centerpieces due to cost. So, they went to thrift stores and antique stores and purchased or borrowed candleholders and used them on the tables.. It was very, very elegant and different.....

11VwVTYYaa	roses and chocolate sounds good. your mate should tell this lass how he feels
S2zTF8bMaa	When you're talking, always keep eye contact. And make sure you give him time to talk, as well as keep the conversation interesting. Sometimes you say more when you listen. When you're talking and keeping eye contact, if it's funny or cute, keep an open-mouth [show teeth] smile. If it's sad, have an understanding look. Awe's are okay, but only to some extent. Most guys think laughing is cute and the best flirt, so practice a cute laugh.(:

YSRXarooaa	well you should know that people in middle school are mean. And maybe you aren't. But wether you are or not people in middle school are gonna say stuff like that. People your age in middle school like to talk bad about people and spread rumors. They just love drama and thats how they are. You can't get upset about every stupid little thing you hear about you because you are gonna hear a lot in middle school. And some people may believe it but the ones who are your friends won't. Just be glad there are not worse rumors about you because they can be pretty mean themselves. Eventually people grow up and get over the drama and it will be easier in high school. So just don't let it bother you because if you do then you are getting involved in the drama and middle school will be even harder for you. So yeah if you don't think you're mean then it doesn't matter what people say. But if you truly think you are a mean person and you don't like that then try and be nicer.|`|HypqcnJaaa	Because people are b*tches. It's okayyy, I'll be your friend! *Big pedophile smile* haha! :)|`|Y5032C2laa	well maybe you are look back on your life and think about u may surprise your self|`|CnM2U1bXaa	thats kind of confuzzzing! but, they r probably just jealous.. forget about it|`|yIHlvPFfaa	thats middle school for you honey, its full of backstabbers, they may seem nice to you but they probably really aren't and you should ask your true friends if they think youre mean just to see if you really are or it could just be another rumor and youre the victim of that rumor, itll be okay just ignore them|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	They say you are mean because they don't really know you.  You probably dress nice,  act nice, look nice and keep to yourself even though you have a choice group of friends and maybe even talk to people who don't talk to them.  So when people don't know all your business they tend to say negative things about you.  Don't worry, you know who you are and you're doing the right things.|`|ANKJdJgxaa	No disrespect, but you are mean.  Your telling us that you are.  You said: "im not that mean" and later said: "there alot of people who are waaaay meaner than me"  So you must be mean, just not on the level you think you are.  But if it concerns you so much, why not try being Nice.  You might like the after effects.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	You are defensive not mean|`|SuMwWNfyaa	get over it.    thats what you do.         they arent worth being friends with if they think your mean.

It doesnt hurt to ask why they think you are mean. Just continue to be yourself. I think you just is totally misunderstood.|`|11VwVTYYaa	well you should ask those people exactly what you did to make them say you're mean and apologize.|`|jbDL2w8faa	tell em to **** off no im jk.

You'll have to deal with it pretty much your whole life and i think the best way to deal with it is to be more of an adult than them and not say anything. Just ignore those stupid jerks! They're not even worth it!|`|RLXP4kwnaa	there most likely just looking for somthing to yap about. their bord and have no life. dont pay any attention to them. you seem very nice to me dont let it get to you.

Recently, my best friend told me a lot of people hated me because they thought i was mean. It made me feel suckish so i tried harder to be liked. I had sleepovers with people i hated and even told people gossip to get conversations started. In the end, my other friend texted me saying she also hated me becasue i had shared all of her secrets and blown her off for a loser. People are SO increadably mean to me at school and i do nothing to them. I don't understand it either! I guess the best thing to do is be nice and ignore crude remarks. People are probably jealous or something. Let them get over it! Im Here For You, Princess! xoxo|`|t0uHDHUTaa	I know what you mean a lot of my  OWN friends say im mean but like it gets me mad because I don't think im mean just very dramatic and kinda play around a lot people will always take things the wrong way maybe you don't mean to do somethings but people think you mean it we all see life in a different way people will always judge without getting to know you just be strong and don't care what other people say and if you want confront them try not to give an additut cuz that's what I tend to do and it gets me no where so breathe then talk 2 them calmly and say I've heard that you think im mean I just wanted to know why you think that and then see wat happens      Good luck!|`|0IcnxUpTaa	Be mean.....its a talent not a weakness.

22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Be firm.   Tell her that she is making it hard for you. You like her and the uncertainty is making you anxious.   If she is going to keep you reserved and drag you along for months, then she is wasting your time and in the end it will be tough on both of you.   Just tell her what you said here and I am sure she will understand...tell her you really need answers and she needs to make decisions soon!|`|6VUesjxxaa	Only you really know...it sounds like the relationship has deteriorated.

Play a little harder to get.|`|co6itGOGaa	it all depends what you broke up over.   if your ex cheated on you then she probably left you to go out with someone else and they turned out being jerks so shes wanting to go back out with you.    if you broke up mutually because you both fell out of place it good to take a long break from each other, about half a year or maybe longer, so you can both have some individual time apart. if you keep fighting about getting back together and are still confused don't force each other to try and make it work when you are not sure. just stay away from each other for a few days or weeks to clear your head.. pretty much the longer you wait the better you'll feel about the other person and forget your differences.|`|AA10803292	bye-bye...|`|BcSZ4Jidaa	only you guys can answer that.|`|0i4sNq2waa	Hasta la pasta|`|AA11830517	your girl ends up with the shits? wtf dude. say this aloud....

You can't be too eager, it sounds like you're kind of pressuring her into it, maybe without realizing you're doing it. She's obviously entertaining the notion, so just let it happen naturally.
RQdiHZdtaa	Your friend may be trying to protect herself. She may be too afraid to hear the truth. But if she's really your friend, she'll listen to you. Before you tell her just explain how much she means to you and how much you want/need her support. Also, try to make it seem like it's not a huge burden on her shoulders. Let her know that things have been taken care of, that your family knows, that she's not the only one. The main thing you have to do is help give her confidence in herself, show that she's needed. But this also is something that you can't force on anyone. It may not be something you can tell her. Honesty is key in a relationship, but if she knows something's going on and doesn't want to know exactly what you can't force it on her. Hope everything gets better for you. Don't give up if you can't tell her. Remember that there are others there for you.|`|olxjR4ooaa	tell her u cant keep hold the secret long enough to ur self and want to tell ur best friend|`|QZRV4C2xaa	Just tell exactly how you feel about her ignoring you. She might not  want to talk about that situation because it is a very intense thing to talk about|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	You obviously feel the need to talk about what happened to you. Maybe your friend just is not the right person.  Are you receiving counseling or any kind of therapy?  If not maybe you should let your parents know that you are stressing and let them find you some help.  As far as your friend is concerned if you are afraid that she may find out what happened and end up not liking you then she is not your friend.|`|DjCLWseZaa	just tell her.|`|9YfhGWMMaa	dont tell her dude she'll totally hate herself if she tells someone. she might be a good friend, but u just never know. when u are absolutely positive she's 100% trustable (well, depending on how big ur secret is) and then talk it out with her see if she's ready.|`|bRisWd7Qaa	If she is a good friend like you say she is then she will listen to you,  Just text her your secret even if she doesn't want to know, friends are meant to be their for each other she should be there for you with what you have been through, she will understand.  Good luck.|`|TqYqQgxEaa	If she is a very good friend like you say she is then just tell her. Writing her a letter might work or just going out for coffee and let her know there's something important you want her to know, letting it off your chest to someone you trust will make you feel better...good luck;)

It sounds like she is ready to destroy her self esteem for a few minutes of giving a guy something that HE will like but will do nothing for her.  Can you put it to her in those terms?  And I know that this will not be popular, but if you have to, get her parents involved.  Parents are there to help and guide (hopefully) and your friend may be ultimately putting her life on the line with this behavior.|`|6AISCFZCaa	tell her that doing drugs and trying to fit in will only make it worst, sure ur going to fit "in" and hang w/ the popular, but having to lose her virginity to that random guy she doesn't even know and taking stuff that can damage her body in many ways, really worth it?     trust me im 14 turing 15 freshmen in high school, i've been through that b4.    if she saids yes, ask her, wat will it do for her (other than fitting in)      hope it helps :)
iwvRBeXOaa	I'm confused....your legs shouldn't be going around his waist, you should just be straddling him with your legs bent backwards beside his legs.|`|hL57d1MNaa	Your legs shouldn't be around his waist when in the cowgirl position. He should be laying on his back with you on top but keep it so that your knees/shin are flat on the bed. Try it like that instead of around his hips. It's alot easier.    Sorry, this is kind of hard to explain but good luck !!|`|ksrZqdFHaa	are you doing it with your knees on the bed or your feet? if you make it so your feet are flat on the bed it should be easier. also you can do doggy style and do the work for him =)
361dd3949c69e539c3ee64de86ebc3a3aa	I'm with Katie-- you sound super mean right now.  Put yourself in her shoes, how would you feel if a whole group of girls you considered friends totally attacked you by saying you don't want to be friends with her and that she may lose other friends.  She is all alone.  Whether is she is annoying or not, you need to act cordial and be respectful.  Why not talk to her one on one about the issues you've been having and try to help her see the problems you feel she has?  Why just turn your back on her when things get hard?  You don't sound like a friend I would want.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	I'd think you already made it clear. Now I guess you need to just leave her alone.|`|g4B66YqPaa	omgg the same thing happened 2 me n my friends! we just told her 2 go away n we dont like her! she still trys 2 talk 2 us n i just walk away n keep doing it! lol...its kinda harsh but oh well she should go away! lol!! n ur no a "mean little *****"! so dont wry bout tht idoit! besides if some ever calls u tht then say "yes i am...thnxx" it gets them mad!

Children dont just wake up being lying miserable jerks, theyre made that way by outside circumstances. She's obviously a very insecure girl that feels so threatened by who she is and what people think of her that she has to tell lies to compensate for the person she thinks she should be and isnt.    Maybe what she needs are people to ignore her bad attributes and be her friend anyway. Being friends with someone doesnt mean you have to put up with their bad traits. you can tell her she's not right and she's a liar, and still be her friend anyway.     The girls got issues. I'd feel pretty sorry for her myself. She's horrible to other people and probably hates herself for it, but doesnt know how to change it.|`|PCBQbQmraa	I would of just ignored her >.> I'm not so mean to do all that but i just ignore. :)|`|DjCLWseZaa	just deal with it until you got to separate schools, then don't answer the phone and just fake when you answer e-mails.

I hope she grows up to be a beautiful, succesfull woman, maybe even somebody famous, and you end up on the streets, and now you have to beg for her to be your friend, and for her help.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Well you brought this on yourself by being completely fake towards her and making her think your best friends and that you like her, then just totally out of the blue, suddenly, you say you don't want to be her friend. Whatever about her annoying you or whyever you don't like her, it was completely unfair of you to do this to her. Then just drop that bomb on her so suddenly. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. Therefore YOU need to have the decency to actually tell her and explain to her why you did that, and that you've been feeling that way for a long time. Have some guts and just be straight up with her. Sounds to me like she'd be better off without fakes like you anyway.|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	go to the counselour and tell her whats happening and take your bffs with you!Tell the counselor all thats all on your mind!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well has it ever occured to you that she only lies to people because she wants to impress them because she has no friends? there are many situations that she could be in that you dont know about. and a note probably was not the most ideal way to go about tell her you were not her friend anymore. you need to apologize for doing it that way, but just explain to her that she lies all the time and she has an attitude. but tell her that you are sick of the headache that she has been giving you and that you are done dealing with her. beyond that, try talking to the school counselor or your parents. good luck! :)|`|8VEEihaqaa	Seems to me like you weren't her friends in the first place, so why does it matter?    Talk to your teacher.  Tell your teacher that you don't want to be friends with her and she won't leave you alone.  Let an adult handle this and don't risk getting yourselves into more trouble, or worse yet, destroying this poor girl's self-esteem even more.|`|CAeU0qyZaa	you don't have to be her friend but don't forget to be polite. say hi to her occasionally and with time she'll get over it and you won't feel like you're all war-torn.  encourage others to be her friends too.  if you can show her than you don't hate her she will probably back off, learn, and make some friends she can treat better.|`|AA10950396	Just tell her. It wont be worth it to ignore her or start rumors about her.|`|FsR19aajaa	Wow. I realize how you may be feeling but the way you expressed it was kind of mean. I feel really bad for that girl. You can't just write a note out of the blue, I know you don't think about the consequences of your actions in 6th grade, but you should've just probably weaned yourself in a different direction from this girl. And saying you "dont take begs" isn't very nice either. if this girl is so desperate to be your friend obviously she didn't see this coming...which is your fault. I dont think you went about this the right way and it seems to be like you created the problem yourself. You seem like you have a good head over you shoulders and you have a good conscience so maybe try to put yourself in her position and see how you would like to be treated, while still making the best decision for you. i'm sorry that I was harsh before, but read my source and you will understand. Good luck!|`|D7Hxp0zDaa	Simply tell her WHY you dont wanna be her friend.  Then, if she begs, tell her straightforward that if she cant stop lying, then shes not friend material.  But dont be mean or rude.  Always be nice.  If youre mean, then youll look no better than her. And you dont like how she acts, so thats not what you want.  Be nice, but be straightforward too.  Good luck.

26d3xsUNaa	i think it's cause you are nervous and you really like him.How about you try to recite what to say,or when you are talking to him you take a deep breath when he is not watching and take it out and then drink some water then you will notice that you don't really feel nervous again i have tried it and og with the flow of the conversation.|`|R8N2QTU9aa	because your thinking too hard... jus go to the table, take a deep breath, relax, and things will just come to you.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	You can't remember what to say because you really like him and that makes you nervous.  It might help if you knew whether or not he likes you the same way.  Once you know that you may not be so nervous.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	your nervous|`|czB9nABWaa	bc hes just to dang cute.|`|PYIHDmAiaa	maybee u like him or have short term memory loss.|`|cLSaq5qaaa	you have alsimers i guess no no lol but you just got to relaxe and calm down because it is probley because your brain is strained trying to say something cool.p.s im a guy.|`|wpbN9ynEaa	maybe your nervous?|`|f0eQ5ILEaa	maybe you like him so much that you get distracted?    just be yourself and relax.  Imagine he's your little sister ;)|`|j9yaSeocaa	Maybe because you don't know how to spell what.|`|9QKZ878Raa	its just a nervous reaction just keep practicing what your gonna say|`|1dVoVp1gaa	because if u forgot something it wasn't that important u only remember important stuff|`|INjM2aC4aa	You might be nervous|`|9moymi4gaa	because whenever you try to act natural and you try to remember something the braing goes with the "Act natural" idea and completely ignores the thing you wanted to say, so in order to remember id be yourself.|`|f6851264bc5d56ceb1264b29ddb15bddaa	maybe ur thinkinh of somethingg else  and u forgett..  I gett that too, It's like pisses me off when i forgettt what i wanted to sayy, soo annoyinhh, what i do is justt thinkk for about 10 minutess and i remember lol  or ur justt like Nervouss|`|TPUJVMeDaa	Because your mind doesnt store useless information.  Whatever you had to say probably wasnt that important.|`|GT0hOEGhaa	Isn't that cute XD|`|SP4VCetEaa	Shy?    Answer my question?    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|pYDh29xlaa	Try to have certain ways of remembering or try to think of something in the spot like I do.|`|XmhYNlumaa	ur thinkin so much and u cant remember wat ur tryin to say happens to me some times.|`|l6FhkqQRaa	I had the same problem..then I relaized it was much easier to just go with the flow of the conversation and not to have any lines already in your head..b/c if the convo doesnt go in that direction then your gonna be sitting there..waiting for it to shift..so you can say your 1 line..that your probably gonna mess up on anyway.  its gonna be hard at first..but give it about 2 weeks..and your gonna be talking..fluently|`|62QGG48Taa	Say, Will-you-go-out-with-me-hot-guy? It's really not that hard. I went through the same thing when i was 11. I just said WILL U GO OUT WITH ME, JORDAN?|`|CQTTit86aa	Is he hot? That's probably what you're focused on.  Or... short term memory?  Or... IDK|`|Zr4q8mkxaa	because you think to much, try not to think so much. try this one instead, it you thought of it blab it out already than just wait for it to get out of your mind, its maybe of you short term memory you just need to practice remembering things better.
LsuvlUD8aa	im not a big flirter either but i know i like it when guys come up to me and grab my waist and walk off snickering (it makes me feel girly) or if you just talk to her( the guy i like is really shy and i wish we talked more) confront her ( alot of girls want a guy to start things) be friends with her and make a friendship out of you two and get closer little by little.|`|0cai0Sieaa	i say just compliment her, talk o her and work on the friendship first..maybe it will turn into something else?|`|SHBqweGEaa	Don't be a jerk like all the other 13 year old guys they are really bad at flirting and no girl is going to like you if you are a jerk. just talk to her and be nice if she. talk to her about your life. don't flirt by tripping her or poking her when you sit behind her girls don't respond to stuff like that. Trust me I should know I'm a 13 year old girl. so just stand out from the rest of the guys don't be a jerk and I'm sure she will respond.|`|Gge8MNTKaa	Don't be someone you're not, girls don't like that. They like when boys are honest. Find out what are some of the things she like and things yall have in common thats always a good starting groud. be yourself dont make yourself into something youre not. if she likes you back, she will like you for you.|`|hJmVcWekaa	Just be really nice to her and compliment her but not in a creeperish way.  Girls are really flattered when a guy compliments her.|`|Q3sbvLeHaa	Just be honest and tell her you like her , If she likes you back then it's easy and if she doesn't want to date you forget her there are like a million other girls I promise|`|xZQjK7oKaa	I don't blame her-- she's 13. Don't get serious with her. Try talking to her and hint that you want to be friends. No need to flirt.|`|d57a522bd60d6e2138974ae192cb39b2aa	Be nice to her and compliment her. but don't be to obvious and the rest will come naturally
ZiLHLMHzaa	Well, he either doesn't really care for you that much or he doesn't realise that people calling you names isn't funny to you. To be honest, the only way to get him to stop doing this is to talk to him. Just tell him that you don't like it when other people call you names and he laughs. If he still does it after that then I think you should let him go.  Good luck with that one...|`|OdTLUprzaa	Cause he's rude! :-(|`|bJF3tGtfaa	Because it's funny.|`|zc47CJZ4aa	Obviously there insults are funny. Why else would he laugh silly. Doesn't exactly mean he thinks they are right. Just funny|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	I have to question how strong your relationship is if he laughs when somebody is insulting and humiliating his girl. I don't mean to get between you, but dang. If my guy did that I would face him and tell him to stop. What he should do is tell them to back off or he should insult them back. Men are there to defend and protect, honestly.|`|isg9i7Z4aa	he's ur boyfriend go ask him y is he laughing even after knowing that it hurts u...might be he thinks u take it easily thats y even he;s laughing ask him and tel him u;ve got this emo say tat it insults u...he'll understand if he loves u and also give the fellows who cal u wired names a nice hit too|`|4f465a2512c2bce2f3ed87b919db1a08aa	because he's a butt???|`|LLAdQwCpaa	he probably wants you to laugh about it  so you don't take it seriously   because if you take those names to heart its eventually going to get to you and make you upset|`|99nsVz1raa	Well it could be that he just feel awkward when they do that so he laugh to relieve the tension. or because he's a total ***. I don't really know it depends on the type of guy he is. But have you tried asking him why? there maybe be a good reason behind it, if you just talk to him about it. either that or he's just a jerk.
IN1X1CVGaa	your just a hot topic! :D  dont worry about it  doing something wont stop them  people just make up **** cause they have no life  you know its not true, and thats all that matters!|`|HtjbZgenaa	At this level it better off not to take on the whole gang at once. if its possible try to confront them when they are by themself, and see how brave they are when they walk away. usually these kind of kids target the weaker ones.|`|4C2rZaeOaa	I would go to the person who is spreading the rumors and ask why they are lying about me. Trust me they will stop. They probably think that they can tun over you seeing that you are quiet.|`|11VwVTYYaa	tell those kids to shut their faces.   you know what's true. those kids are just jealous|`|kZWKdPtOaa	What are these rumors about I can't help without knowing what they are saying. You don't have to say everything they say just something so I can get an idea to help you.
AA10223196	Don't make the same mistakes.  Practice positive thinking and have confidence and high self esteem.|`|PCBQbQmraa	its all in how you look :)|`|X7fJjXFuaa	i know it might feel like the end of the world, but i promise it's not. just be yourself and if other people don't like you for you, then they should eff off.     don't fall into a trap where you think you have to be like everyone else. you are unique, let it show.    also, geeks rule the world, doncha know?|`|zdPqht41aa	be yourself try not to create an alter ego that makes it worse just be the guy everyone likes to talk to like at school i was the quiet new kid untill ppl started talking to me then i turned into a socialite evryone knows me and knows what im capable of ts kinda cool and there is no one in my school branded with popular|`|o1irBbeNaa	first, dont think of your self as a dork, thats your first problem. if you think of your self as a dork then so will everyone else. i dont know you personally but it sounds like a confidence problem.when you meet new people just be your self, dont try to be someone else because you wont be happy in the end. you dont want to hang out with people who you have nothing in common with anyway. just remember that the people you choose to be friends with now will affect who you are in the future|`|mYAbq6fnaa	no offense, but there really are worse things in life than being a dork, even though it might not seem like it right now. just be nice to everyone and dont care so much about what other people think. the only thing that really matters is what you think of yourself. but just be yourself and be a little more outgoing to make new friends.|`|CAeU0qyZaa	be genuine. and first off you might want to say how you've screwed up your rep-we're not here to judge although thats what most of the people on here do..  anyway just be nice and try to rectify what you've done wrong . apologize if need be and show people you've changed if you have. don't do it for them, do it for you. and if you move just take this as a learning experience to be the best you can be in your new area.-don't let these experiences bog you down.|`|D7Hxp0zDaa	Well, it depends on what you did to ruin your reputation..?  Can you tell me what you did?  Im sure then I can help (:    And it kind of doesnt matter if youre moving.  Because youre moving away from the the people that youve ruined your reputation around. And youll be around a new city, and new people and new things.  So just forgot about all of the mess-ups youve made in the city youre in now, and try to be YOURSELF and undorkish (lol) at the new place you move to.    Youll do great (:  Good luck.    :D

61649d6425b61bc4f5b5ea20d6e20a1faa	He is afraid that he will make a fool out of himself in front of you.  Boys can do that when they like a girl.  In the 5th grade I would go out of my way walking through the halls, so that I could avoid my girlfriend.  So just be patient maybe go up to him.|`|ENKPF0oaaa	he prolly likes you but hes scared hes gunna mess it up and say the wrong thing to you    so you should just go up and start talking to him|`|FJo4crNjaa	he don't like you *****
NuCu5RbTaa	what will has to do with a prenup? u use prenup in case of divorce, u  use will in case of death. they do not even coincide with each other|`|yfcJwQr8aa	well a prenup is for if you decide to divorce..and the will is for if you die.  They are completely different.  once your married your prenup is final and can not be changed...its not like a divorce decree.
jqkK4h6Haa	Well this depends. Are you dating this girl? Or are you just friends? If you are dating her then take her to the movies and pay for everything. be really nice. If she says its cold, she just wants you to put your arm around her. If she is just a friend. Take her to the movies and just be nice. Don't flirt to much because if you are only going alone with her then she will get awkward. So if she is just a friend then take some other friends along with you. Probably another guy and another girl.   I hope this helped a little

K2icX1Ozaa	okay by giving you the cold shoulder he is trying to ween you off  he is distancing himself from you so that you will break up with him instead of him having to do it.  you should forget about his crap i know you like him a lot but you gotta move on if hes one of those dogs that humps a new leg whenever he gets bored of the old one|`|v67oAVt1aa	he doesnt like you anymore so you should dump him because hes close to dumping you or cheating on you

She knew your friends were going to tell you.  Thats her way of letting you know how she feels.  Good luck|`|TlU3zj61aa	Just ask her out!

Good Luck!|`|ZYOwcdVcaa	Ask her out! There's no way of knowing unless you do so.

h0wDABGbaa	youre freakin gorgeous!  dont be so hard on yourself, you cant exactly be 'picky' in choosing a guy. either you like them in that way or you dont.  and youre still young, plenty more time for relationships.  ive had similar experiences too, i didnt like the guys that liked me and vice versa.  good luck!|`|Zq772U4Aaa	your really hot. your only fifteen start worrying about a serious relationship when your a junior or something|`|sb830VAPaa	im sure youll find someone special. youre definitely pretty|`|uz0R5pjHaa	You're pretty hot! 9.5!

Your young you should have fun with them, don't be to serious. :)|`|nrNJBGdQaa	ur reli pretty and u look older than 15|`|LaW4K6Rlaa	You look very nice. I don't know why other guys don't like you. If they are popular and hang out with other jocks/popular kids, they are swarmed with the "I know I look good, but i need to push it in there faces." kind of girls. It's not being picky, and you still have a few more years of school to really get in the dating game.
yIHlvPFfaa	lol no dont say that, youll seem a little weird, just walk up to him and be like "hey i know you like football did you watch the superbowl? whod you root for?" etc. just go on from there, agree with him even if you didnt watch the football game or go with what your dad likes so you dont seem like a poser, so talk to him about football, i have to say it works because thats what im doing with the guy i like :P   good luck|`|JNcbYYoraa	The Superbowl idea is good!|`|3rxzsxHTaa	Ugh. No one cares. Tell one of your friends about this stuff. Please!|`|eSDNSq4zaa	say hi and then his name. be like whats up? and the conversation goes on from there. make sure you look pretty though.|`|rLTHQWeEaa	yeah so you get a conversation started but be like a little more girly  then you start talking about other things so you see what you have in common|`|2uXNtCUlaa	show more of an interest in the things that he likes that will give the two of you something to talk about. Then when you guys establish more of a friendship move in for the kill, start by filtering with him always wear a smile when you are around him. Laugh at his jokes,but not to much or he will begin to think that your half crazy. ask him out once you are more confident around him. You never know until you ask him how he feels about you. Life is to short to stand by and let it slip pass you, if you like him go for it. best of luck|`|miyzjPktaa	lol...yeah  but just be yourself|`|EH6lz77Daa	JUST talk|`|h8G1x2ioaa	noooooo never say that to a boy they would think ur crazy just go slow wit him and let him see u|`|2GuDOMwTaa	You sound young but let me help you out a bit. Go out to the movies and get to know him there. Or call him and ask him how He's been. The football thing is funny. Try it if you want. But if he asks you if you also like football I don't know what you'll tell him then. Don't show him that you supposedly like football. Or he'll start asking you questions you might not know. Up to you. But try the "going out" thing. It might help a bit.|`|Dg5qbQtJaa	Haha a little football chatter is nice.. but don't go over bored or it'll seem out of place for a girl ya know? Best thing you could prolly do is ask him to lunch or something. Now what to talk about is another story, but he'll start thinking your interested in you if you ask him to lunch. With that in mind you might want to prepare somethings to talk about cuz if he is interested in you then he will prolly be very quiet at lunch :p. If you don't know him to well maybe you should talk to him a bit over the next week and then bring up lunch or what have you :).|`|ghLdIUz0aa	dont watch something you dont like because of a boy, then he will think your into sports, and talk to you about football, and you'll just look like a complete idiot and say yea all the time. plus, he will get the wrong impression then when it comes time for you to tell him your not into sports, he wont be able to trust you, bc u lied to him. i would say like, just ask him about how his day was, or what hes doing in the weekend, be straight forward with him and say, listen i want to get to know you, but i dont know what to say, so maybe he will ask you out on a date. then if you do go on a date, talk about your family, your pets, your friends, just everyday things that you would talk to your friends about *minus the boy stuff*|`|EBGp67k1aa	no don't do that he will jut think your weird.  just if he doesn't know your name introduce yourself and just say hi to him in school and eventually he will talk to you more. then you can say stuff like "WOW MAN DID YOU SEE THAT?"  then once he starts to talk to you more ask if he wants to get some coffee or sometime or something like that?|`|brHPYhWbaa	Just be yourself. Become friends first and get to know him! Try sitting with him @ lunch or hanging out with him but just as friends first. Just act natural, if you don't then he might get the wrong impression. And if you can relate to the football stuff thats great. If you want to watch the superbowl thats great but you can always find other things that you guys have in common. Also make jokes and be funny. Try to have inside jokes and stuff.I hope that was helpful and I hope I can help again.|`|EiS6jnApaa	Yes. Talk about things he is interested in, and be funny.    Dont stick to him like glue, but make small talk so he knows who you are.    Be friends, and then maybe more ;)|`|8d1UmJbvaa	If he likes football then talk to him about sports. Don't be nervous girl I have over come my fear of talking to really cute boys. Personally I would just talk to friends who are boys about sports. Well thats all I have. Hope this helps!

RxJzvUu7aa	If he is sending you flirty messages maybe hes into you too, so maybe you should let him know your kinda into him and see what he says back? but then you might feel bad because he has a girlfriend? that could be a hard situation to be in. Just worry about yourself and do what you feel like needs to be done. If you cant stop thinking about him and you already tried to just tell him how you feel and that will let you know for sure if you should just forget about it, atleast then you know your not waisting your time worrying about some guy with a girlfriend forever.|`|3jWaexYOaa	ok ive seem this b4 he dosen't like you cuz if he did he would be with u right now ... but sorry he isn't somthing like this happen with mi friend and the guy just played hur in the end ... nd realli to tell you the truth it sounds like this guy is playing you ...|`|C9xguzBXaa	to bad he does not like you

Slip a note in her locker.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I would go up to her, apologize to her face to face and ask if I can make it up to her.  It can be anything.  If you really like her, there's no need to be distant away from her and asking her out would be probably a wise idea to do so.  Next time, choose your words very carefully.|`|yWpiiSXhaa	wen u  apologiseyou are really sorry....u apologize her....she can see that in ur eyes n ur words|`|62QGG48Taa	Say, I'm sorry what I did and I dont hate you. Your not my best friend your my sister.  Nothing will change that because I love you. I miss you. If it wasn't for you I would not be myself.|`|DjCLWseZaa	send a letter to her house. tell her that you are sorry that such rumors spread and that you miss her. give another copy to her mom so she will give it to her if she ignores the first one.
TlU3zj61aa	STOP TALKING! The thing is people (including yourself) always want to talk about themselves. So if you stop talking and LISTEN you'll make more friends. Give other people a chance to talk about themselves and they'll like you better and give you more time to talk.    When you find yourself talking about yourself too much, just finish your sentence and ask the person your talking to a question thats related to what you were talking about. Get their opinion and their thoughts. And actually listen, don't just pretend.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Well you could stop talking and listen once in a while.  The world isn't all about you and people like to know you remember they have a sick dog or lost some weight or got a good grade etc.  STart being more aware of what is happneing to others and comment on it in a complimentary way.    It is ok to share some things about you...but you have to stop talking occasionally and listen to what people are saying and feeling too.    It isn't just annoying..but arrogant to not listen about what others have to say.    edit..    Oh..and be genuine about it.  Everyone can tell when you are just pretending...so actually CARE about others.|`|mDTkpuiuaa	stop talking for like a day and then count to three before you reply to anyone.  also don't talk to anyone your not solid with unless they talk first.|`|O1WxKk7uaa	so your a guy.. well try talking less like keeping your mouth shut when you talk with girls and listen to them.. but all in all just keep your mouth shut and you'll stop being annoying|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well this is you. I feel the same way and I was in your same situation. I've trained myself not to talk so much and when I notice I am, I stop myself. I chew gum to help myself. Or if my friends (in the past, I stopped worrying about making friends and more about my school work) would ignore me I wouldn't talk to them for the rest of the day. But anyways, I would limit my talking, chewing gum worked for me. You can find something that can keep you from talking, like fiddling with your fingers, writing a story, doing schoolwork, or something else.

Read your first 14 words again and jump for joy!  You don't have to be scared and sad anymore!  I'm happy for you-you just did one of the hardest things you will ever have to do.  There is nothing like feeling trapped like that and now you are free!  You are already more than halfway there sweetie.  Now all you have to do is give it time, take your lessons, and get out there with your friends and family and have some fun.  You are sad now-you're mourning the loss of a relationship, but that will pass, and when it does, you'll be able to enjoy life with a partner who really loves you.  OK, maybe I didn't make you smile.  But you made me smile with your tough choice.  Have a great year.

I told you it was lame:  Heres a poem:    Love is a game between two people,  Each one immersed, addicted to it.  All you can think of is each other,  Impressing, pleasing, and loving them;  And if they were dying,  You would give your heart to let them live,  Or suffer the worst way to see them survive.    But how do you know they arent bluffing?  What if they wouldnt do the same for you?  If you gave them your heart,  But they didnt do the same?  Forever, I would be depressed.    Love is a show, a holiday carnival,  Where there are games, food, and prizes,  All in the Love game just little things.  Like a crush, or a sweet note.  But the fireworks, thats true love.  Ive gone to the carnival often,  But Ive missed the fireworks every time.    Try not to think about it. I'm sure you are a beautiful strong woan and brave to get out of that.

To boost your spirit listen to your favorite song, or watch an uplifting movie. Call over a few of your friends for a girls night; and just have fun! Anyway, congratulations to you.

cPgOxcS7aa	I wouldn't say he is blowing you off,but it sounds like he maybe stringing you along.  If he is totally serious about you and stuff then he needs to fix his myspace page and add you to his first spot.  It is always hard to have a long distant relationship unless you 2 really trust each other.  You may want to think about what you are getting into before you get hurt.|`|SsGLm3Xvaa	He seems like those guys who really likes to flirt and kinda have cyber-sex and stuff with different girls...    I think he's probably stringing you along, yes.  He's probably asked other girls to be his girlfriend, too.    I say, don't fall for it, please.    Find a boyfriend you meet in real life who you know really wants a relationship and not just fooling around. :)|`|Q2z5a4Xpaa	he's playin you if you ask me!|`|Y7CqVKsaaa	Um sorry to burst your bubble, but until you've actually met him it's not a relationship. Or at least not a very good one.    Internet relationships don't last. Try and meet him, and if he doesn't want to meet then forget about him. Just make sure you meet him in public and preferably with a friend in case he turns out to be some messed up 40 year old bloke!|`|RRZYO6fqaa	Really? You wanna date somone you met online? I think what you did is kind of stupid. Chick, seriously I call that "computer love". If they wanna meet you in April they are probably plotting to hurt or kidnap, (etc.) you. I'm only 14 and know better.|`|yX4INokGaa	This is a tricky one. You have to remain calm, you've gotten yourself in this relationship on a whim, therefore you sort of agreed to creating a relationship without a physical presence. If he has female friends, then ask him about that (but only once). You shouldn't have to worry about calling him. If he's really into you at the moment he wouldn't let days go by.     If anything, i know you don't want to end up being someone's Cyber-girlfriend. He's probably contemplating about the relationship. Going all out should be 50/50. He can always see you on the weekends and make arrangements... Does he?    -----------------THAT'S A BIG FAT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!    April is 2 whole months from now.    I think you should fall back and let him make the next move, and if he doesn't "NEXT!"     You don't want to share your sweet treats and tricks with him too soon even if he says he wants you for more than sex. It may be talk because most guys esp. college guys act on impulse.    DON'T let those sweet nothings make you fall for a possible dud.    XOXO

2uXNtCUlaa	Ok first of all calm down this not going to make the rest of your life a total disater. Believe it or not you will move on from this sitution things could be a lot worse. Becasue nothing happend sexually (dirty) between the two of you then there is nothing to worry about. Stay away from this guy though in the feature, it is considerd rape because you are only 12 yrs of age and he is much older then you, he could go to jail. In the feture though you should focus on school, and not rush into being a grown up enjoy being a kid and dont focus on boys, they will come all in time.. You will be an adult soon enough. But like I said before this is not going to ruin your life. Just tell your friend who knows this "secret" to not tell anyone and be mature about the whole thing. And if she starts telling people pertend like you dont even know what the heck she is talking about basically play dumb..it works everytime. She will end up looking like the idoiot if you act like you dont know what she is talking about. BE A CHILD  & dont rush into being with boys-best of luck-|`|3cQJhSqXaa	**** you!|`|11VwVTYYaa	he rubbed her back??  well there is absolutely no harm in that.   im sure if the story does get around it won't be a big deal i mean he rubbed her back. big deal|`|VyHMmGeaaa	girl dont be scared  Even if she tells will that kill u   u will probably get humiliated,yeah so what!!

When they say it to you just reply with something that's not rude like I'm really not gay but believe what you want to.  It worked for my friend at first he just got mad and looked a little ridiculous but then he just ignored them and they didn't say anything to him anymore.  Or you could get a girlfriend haha    Good luck!|`|rR0rPVAEaa	Say- Your gay, all you think about is gay! Or ignore them. Tell them to get a life. Punch them?

gf4X8FOnaa	im guessing you mean a cute way to ask him not ask him cutely.  here are some ideas.  1) put a line of goldfish (snacks) from his front door to a pretty area like a garden or something. ring his doorbell and have a note that says "_name_ follow these goldfish for a surprise. then when he sees you be like "out of all of the fish in the sea, will you go to sadies with me?"  2.) bake a cake and write Sadies? on it with balloons.  3) a scavenger hunt that leads to you.  4) get a fortune cookie and take out the fortune with tweezers and put a note in that says "Sadies with _your name_?" and give it to him  5)decorate his room and  just ask him straigh out.    Or you could just ask him like normal at school but make sure that when you ask him its just the two of you-no friends there. and make sure that you really want to go with him. This year (2 weeks ago) I went to formal with a guy i didnt know too well cuz i didnt want to go stag and he was like the only guy left and i asked him like normal at school. 1. i wish i did something cute 2. i hated going with him, i wish i asked a guy who i really wanted to go with      Funny story:  My sister asked a guy out by putting cinnamon rolls in a toy dump truck and then she attached a note that said, 'I'd like to haul your buns to the Sadie Hawkins.' HAHAHAHA!|`|7SCOqUa8aa	i would agree with the other people who answered .. just ask him, we guys dont care much for cute stuff.. lol|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Studder with the words but dont studder so much that he thinks your stupid.  Also blush and look into his eyes and look away a few times.  Just dont let him have the impression your scared.  But doing it in a shy way is cute to most guys.|`|ICjBorriaa	just say " hey would you like to come to the dance with me?"    You are a girl, so you are cute by default!|`|WoAAdxHEaa	just ask him. I've rejected girls because they were too shy to ask me in person (notes, friends asked for her, IM, e-mail). I can't deal with that stuff.|`|cLSaq5qaaa	well every guy likes it diff. so get a wing man(a person who talks good about you and finds info)to find out what he likes .i personly like a girl girl kind of way    i am a guy.|`|gvbK8VHgaa	get a sky-writer to fly over your school asking him. it might cost a lot of money but it would be a long term investment for you because after you both finish school and go to college and he becomes a doctor you can marry him, then divorce him, take all his money and there you have it you get your money back for what you paid for the skywriter.|`|m4UlsX3haa	i agreewith the first guy... just ask him straight out... it doesn't matter if you say it in a cute way or not, it won't affect his decision (just don't say it when you're super grumpy or pissed off, and smile and be happy when you ask)|`|Edg0u3W2aa	Just ask him.  He'll probably appreciate it.  And while you two are dancing, you can whisper in his ear if he thinks you're cute!    Just ask!    "Ask and it will be given to you" Matthew 7:7|`|VfUt5QTDaa	The best way to approach this would be to ask the guy to dance yourself. I wouldn't chicken out because guys like girls who aren't shy.
k61MeNEKaa	umm chill out your 13  sex is not a gamee ...  wait until your olderr   w.e you do don't get pressuredd.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	yeah, don't screw up your life by having a kid at like 14.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	your 13, you should wait  he wont be with you for too long anyways  [not trying to sound mean just realistic]|`|7VMLssSnaa	no no  no.  bad idea.  find new friends.    wayyy to young.|`|3rDbLSZBaa	just be friend with your boyfriend. sounds like he cares about you and your life. fck the others. get friends like your bf|`|ePEu6hMxaa	your only 13,wait until your ready..  i think its great how he doesnt pressure you,but make sure you dont get ''into the moment'' and do something you regret|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Don't have sex with him.  Him saying "He will not pressure you into it" sounds like a sweet thing right? Well wrong, usually a guy sais this because it makes him sound innocent and will make the girl want to give up their virginity earlier.  Treasure your virginity and wait until the perfect guy comes along to take it away.  Not just some guy that is three years older then you.  Three years isnt much but when its 13 and 16 it is.|`|xpJcnM88aa	Go hangout with friends around your age. :)  Don't listen to those people.|`|ij9N9r5waa	Find a younger Boyfriend and WAIT.|`|LMPF5X4raa	i agree....13 is wayyyyyyy to young....wayyyyyyy. find a new guy..he's too old for you. thats prolly all he wants..new friends too. bad influence.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	you're THIRTEEN.  don't have sex. :/  sounds like you need new friends if they're the ones pressuring you to have sex.|`|sMu8midlaa	Do not have sex just because your friends are. Listen to your boyfriend, he is right. Whenever you feel comfortable, it could be weeks, months, or even years until you feel comfortable. I agree with the other poster, it is not a game. Sex is quite serious. It COULD change your entire life.|`|1wb9rotSaa	okay.  im 20 and i haven't even had my first kiss yet.  Im glad your bf is not pressuring you.  your friends are idiots.  don't pay attention to them tell them its none of their business.  I hope you know to use protection later to protect from preg and HIV.|`|AA11252398	Why is a 16 year old dating a 13 year old?      Kids these days....        You're 13. Think about school.  Why should sex be an issue when you are barely into puberty?  If he's 16 and ready tell him to find another 16 year old to have sex with.  Then they can get pregnant and ruin their lives.    Don't grow up before you actually grow up.|`|Yy28UP2aaa	I understand that you are feeling some pressure to have sex, even though your guy isn't pressing you, the things our friends are saying are making you feel like a loser for not being sexually active. I think most women would agree that their first sexual experience was not a good one and that is because either they were too young and their partner was inexperienced ot they felt pressured to do it.  You sound like a pretty level headed young lady so please do not make the mistake that a lot of young girls do by having sex before they feel comfortable doing it or have sex just cause everyone else is doing it. Sexually transmitted diseases are rampant among high school aged kids and that is something that can be with you for the rest of your life or even end our life. A lot of kids your age (and Adults) choose to think that those things won't happen to them and are hurt and angry when it does. I really don't want to lecture but think very carefully about this. You may be mature for your age but you are too young to start having sex, especially with someone you may not be with next week or next month.Go with your instincts.|`|9juqrpPIaa	ursoo young odds r ur not goin to be wiht ur boyfriend for soo long just got rush and have sex wehn everyone else is|`|FnSXc0xNaa	no your only 13|`|kGTvJS4paa	If you are scared, that is your answer. Your not ready. And its good that your boyfriend isn't pressuring you. Do it when your ready, it will be a lot more special if you wait.|`|PTXFO6asaa	wait....    Tell your friends that you and your boyfriend have agreed not to have sex until you are both ready.    They may say otherwise, but deep down they will admire both you and him.... and wish they had done the same.|`|5kXe739Naa	if your worrying your not ready for it.. when your ready for it .. your 100% sure thats what you want..|`|8YT3nsKraa	bad idea  all its going to lead to is u getting hurt  take your time and let things happen for a reason and not cause you want to fit in with your friends|`|lK7RSKTUaa	its is YOUR decsion and no one elses. don't just do it to fit it you will regret it, you'll know when your ready and from the snounds of it your not right now other wise you wouldn't be asking, wait it out.|`|NM7hHtQZaa	omg your introuble ha  just wait until your ready and if he's willing to wait for you  then take advantage of that...dont follow the crowd be independent  sex is a big thing it has to be with the right person you dont want to   be a hoe....|`|rp71Mclraa	I'm glad you're scared, you should be. please dont have sex yet, jsut becuz "every1s doin it." ur bf seems sweet that hes not pressuring u into it, so dont do it, ull regret it later believe me|`|Edg0u3W2aa	DON'T!!!!  You're 13 (way too young)!  Keep your innocence.    Your friends are older anyways.  Just because your friends do doesn't mean you should.    Let's say all your friends do drugs.  Would you?      Be yourself!  Don't!|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	do it and when you are ready and trust me comin from someone who went down that path (me)i was 13 and i did it and you should wait juss don let him pressure you,!!|`|c0rwAx3Paa	If you are unsure then the answer is a flat NO|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Don't do it MS.Ceely Dont do it!!!!!! You will be in way over your head. Back off and look at dating boys your own age. Your virginity is way too precious to just give it away. Trust me in 10yrs (maybe less) you will look back on this with plenty of regrets. Research on STDs pregnancy and talk this over with a parent or an adult you value and trust first. Good Luck and dont be in such a rush!!!!!|`|X7fJjXFuaa	don't do anything that you aren't comfortable with. always trust your gut feelings about this kind of thing.     most young women don't feel ready until they know more about sex and are in a good, respectful relationship.     if you need information about sex and birth control, go to your local planned parenthood to discuss ways to protect yourself if you do decide to have sex with your boyfriend.    BUT if you are scared and unsure, don't do it. if your boyfriend really loves you he will respect your wishes.|`|dYRWG3WTaa	I totally agree with cuteface....BAD idea, don't do it, you may think you're ready, but you're not, you're too young and you will regret it later! And when you do find the right guy, you will wish it was him you waited for, not the guy you dated when you were 13.  I know right now you think he's the one and you'll be together forever,  but chances are very slim, in fact post a POLL and ask how many girls thought their b/f at the age of 13 was going to last forever and how many of them that are in their 20's are still with that same kid....very few.|`|q7n411T9aa	ok kiddo u need different friends! u r still sooooo young and u need to realize tht. u even say tht ur scared. u have to listen to those little signs. you should NEVER feel like u have to do something because of pressure. plus i must say something. at this point in ur life u should b dating someone closer 2 ur age. wen u actually get into high school it will b differnt but being in middle school dating a sophmore/junior is not safe. he is much older than u and may try 2 take advantage of u. just b safe and plz listen to wut ur body is trying  2 tell u.|`|0IcnxUpTaa	At 13 the last thing you should be thinking about is what to do about sex. You have plenty of years to engage in such an activity but for now enjoy being a kid.
71qGan9Raa	I've been thinking of these things since I was about 6. I'm 40 now!   The way I look at it is this, you, me, your mom, dad are here now but they are probably also existing on another dimension too.  I think we're here for the experience because that's what we take back to our-selves. We experience sadness on this plane but maybe happiness on the other...we always experience the opposites so we have a full experience. If we murdered people on this plane, the other plane we would be the one being murdered....that's my idea at this moment in time. It could change tomorrow or in a year or two. I'm still learning, thinking and re-thinking.  Is this real??? Only our experiences! When you come to the point that your really know NOTHING, that's when you reached EVERYTHING!  Good luck on your journey.|`|ZRk2Hcuraa	It doesn't matter if its real. It could be fake, it could be a past life, and we could all be dead already. What does matter is that instead of sitting here, wondering about it, and then not doing anything, we should make the best of it no matter what. Don't waste your time doubting your existence-where will that get you? Sure, its good to ask questions and think about life. But don't let it overcome you, take life as it comes. Worry about the rest later. ;)|`|HqG4MDxGaa	This whole entire world is just a "simulation" (like the Matrix). There is a parallel universe that IS real that functions like a blanket being wrapped around "Earth" and the universe we "think" we see (the "simulation"). (Holy crap, I've lost myself in my own thoughts.....lol).|`|CBdKPtUYaa	Um, wow, I don't really know. I think about this too. I just don't get life some times. I wonder to but sadly I don't have a answer. I don't think any one truly does, sorry.|`|sYxtPBziaa	Yeah, yeah... genius my ***. I used to think about that crap as a kid too, but i stopped. I realized that i was wasting my life by thinking about it. If you really think about it, we as human beings know absoleutly nothing. We make up names for things and theories, try to find ways of explaining them, but do we ever know if what we know is right? no. In the end, it's all just a sad attempt to provide security while we try and actually find out what life is really about. Sure life could be a flashback, or it could be that past of the present, whatever the case it is useless to think about it. Because when you think, you use what you were taught. And everything you were taught was a lie. The way to finding lifes meaning is by feeling and emotion. Not the words but what you feel is right and wrong. You may try and fail, but in the end all that matters is the experience that you have gained.|`|BznAZIeJaa	i dont know see a thrapist free 2 points lol!|`|cTWiFzJCaa	Maybe it is true? And what would you if we were living in a flashback? I would try to change everything possible, make the flashback end somehow, even if it is a flashback... Besides, what happens when you're sleeping?|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Accept that this is all real by default, because this existence is the only one we are aware of. If you spend too much time pondering esoteric things like this, you will miss out on the essence of what makes existing like this worth it.
RlvB6Fpmaa	She's your soul sister!   Always keep her close. (:|`|nyylb6qUaa	You have a very strong bond with her. When I met my former best friend when we were both very young, we were the same way. I shut off my whole life for him. He was the only thing I ever lived for. Now my life is shallow and lonely. He does not care for me no more, and I am all alone. So, whatever you girls have, keep it, it is from God. Don't ever lose it. May God Bless.|`|A57LMS5Qaa	very strong bond. im the same way with one of my friends. and i feel like i care more too. i tlked to her about it and it made me feel a little better. its gotten better as time went on, i still miss her like that and everything. but i feel a little better bout everything. thats kinda a stupid answer huh?|`|Erdyu0bEaa	May be you just have a strong sisterlike bond you share with her that cannot be broken. You will always have a life long friendship with her hopefully then.|`|9aJOQtw8aa	Because she is your best friend? We all have this feeling.|`|rS7fh6pRaa	Ummm maybe you spend too much time together. or maybe you actually like her ..|`|mYAbq6fnaa	its probably because thats the one person that you can tell anything to and that understands you completely. you dont have to hide anything from her, and its so easy to be around her because you have to hide things from everyone else. and its easy to miss your bff's sense of humor when shes not around or the way she always seems to cheer you up. thats the bond of sisterhood.|`|1ye5MDU4aa	Maybe she likes you.|`|6qCYH2ESaa	i had that same problem for a very long time then i just had to try and ignore the hurt it caused me when she left for a few days.... i couldn't ... so mabey you could try that or even hetting together before she leaves every time so it doesn't seem so long.|`|w5FJ6jtkaa	get together with her.  you guys seem like the perfect couple :D|`|f1efa317fe3139e94297478f9b6af987aa	you two were meant to be...|`|yxEcjp4waa	are you a girl?  maybe you two have a lesbian bond...?    um, thats kinda weird.     just go and get married.   woo.|`|YROG9aGKaa	Well first of all. Why would you miss her so much, that is really retarded.|`|qXouM3sfaa	shes ur best friend ur supposed to miss her!!!|`|sENnbDlhaa	maybe its because you've known her so long that you have grown so close to her(:    i mean if you are really close to eachother and you feel the same way about eachother then maybe you should move in together ?  like college roomies:D
07YBD5mJaa	if she is abusing you sweet heart you should report it to someone, maybe a school teacher you are close to, or a friends parent. child abuse is not how an adult should deal with their stress...and i am so sorry you have to deal with such behavior. My father was very abusive to me when i was younger, much worse than your mother seems to be. I got so tired of it, nothing ever seemed to help the situation. One night when i was 15 years old, he attempted to murder me. I ran away. I went to a friends house and called the police. I was put into foster care, and although it wasn't as simple as that, i survived.   My advice, speak with someone, have them call CSP. I know this sounds horrible and very scary, but you'll be placed some where safe while your mother gets help. They will have you attend supervised therapy sessions weekly with your mother, and if you decide that your mother has improved then you can always return back home. if not, stay in foster care, be safe, and visit with your mother.   no child should ever have to be abused, ever.  I hope that you can find the strength to talk to an adult, because it will help you out so much!  stay strong my dear!!!  best wishes=]|`|wrq7rzNnaa	That sounds really horrible. I am soo sorry that you are going through all of this and at such a young age too.    Part of me wants to tell you that you need to get out of that house because it isn't fair. But the other part tells me that you need to throw a huge tantrum right back at her! Scare her into thinking that you don't give a crap anymore. Throw something right back at her!    I would call a support hotline or something so they can councel you over the phone when you need someone to talk to.    Good Luck!|`|aFzqYyLSaa	Where's the dad in this picture? Maybe he can give some help? Or your mothers sister? or Sister in law. Talk to a family member who knows her. See what they say.|`|sENnbDlhaa	woww that is really sad):    well, just talk with a councelor by yourself and maybe without your mother to see what you can do(:    you have to tell someone you can't keep it inside !      p.s: never say you arent good enough..!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	talk to another family member about this. and just try to be nice to your mom as much as possible. do some extra chores around the house occasionally or surprise her with dinner on the table. it will put her in a good mood.|`|iJmafJWBaa	err. well me and my mother have a very bad relationship too. i think it is because your mother doesn't trust you, or you don't give her a reason to trust you about anything. so my advice... give her a reason!|`|zGKmgwofaa	Wait until she does something really "Over the edge".    Leave.   Run away and don't return for a while, find a friend's place to stay at.    She will grow to miss you and when you return she will be much more kind to you. I'm not just saying this, it WILL work.    Same thing here, and things have been great ever since.|`|oQq1rqDVaa	First of all good for you for getting help and realising that there is nothing you can do about this except to get on with your life, leave home as soon as possible and put some distance between you and your Mom.  A good support group would help you right now - maybe a local group at a good church.|`|18afBRSXaa	Get out of there! i am not going to tell you to go straight to another counselor but go to a friends house and hide out there. Dont let your mother know you are there. She might threaten you and/or your friends. Get help from one of your friends parents and im sure that nobody will turn you down. Get help. Email me at soccerblondie787@aim.com and tell me how you are, and what you are doing. I feel like i am connected to you somehow and i dont know why. I prayed for you. God is watching over you.|`|76DMnYwnaa	i went through the same thing with my mom, i was 14 and after six months my mom went to the doctor and was going through the "change" you know menopause... it sux but it just got to the point with me and mine that when she was mean i told her... i wasnt harsh or rude but when she said things i would turn look her in the eyes and say  "mom what you just said hurts my feelings it makes me feel bad about my self and worse its making me hate you...please stop" it made my mom cry but she understood that she was hurting me... u need to be honest|`|tHD3xMt7aa	you sound cool and no offence but your mother may be a bit over board try to find as much help as you can and if you have any more guestions ask dont be to shy tto go to a conculor withot telling your mother.hope you do better:).sorry your story is so sad :(|`|hwKcqXp6aa	If its really that bad call the child protective services, for more advice, and professional for that matter, you can call the boys and girls hotline, there's a link in the source section, it has all the numbers, if you just want to talk, or if you have family problems, there's a specialty for all those numbers, give it a try, it's confidential, and they'll give you the best advice out of anyone you'll find here on yahoo since they're trained professionals at these types of things|`|JiQ5VQPdaa	I think that both of you have to solve this problem. You said that you have seen a counselor but that hasn't work. Maybe find a way to cope with your mother. I do not know what causes the problems but it might be that your mom expects you to do things and maybe you don't normally do them. I don't know the problems because you did not write them. Sorry if I'm wrong. Try meeting your mom half way on whatever problems you are having. Try, because if you don't the problem might become worse. Sorry I did not write a good solution.   Hope your relationship gets better. =)|`|AH4TVEBIaa	well it really depends on who starts what and who should change, but lets say if it was your mother that is the problem, she has no right 2 threaten u. 2 solve this is get support. u should get help from your relative if no relatives emancipation would be 1 idea (not the best solution but if u have nowhere 2 go 2 that MITE help) the best solution i can think of is your relatives ether talk 2 your mom or you can stay with 1 of your trusted relative tell them you r fed up with it and if it is o.k. stay with them eventually shill think things throgh because ignoring this will hurt u more.  I hope i helped u   But like what i said, the person that needs 2 change should change 2 stop this.|`|MpiTctvbaa	What are u doing to make her so mad? She cant be yelling for no reason.|`|Q4pp2LhQaa	My grandmother can act like this sometimes.  It usually means she is under stress.  I am not siding with her, but think about if she is going through a divorce or lost a job.  Stand up for yourself, but don't yell, fight, and stuff.  She will give you a lot more respect if you act composed.  Just tell her how you feel and try and work around it.  Sorry, I know it sounds like a stereotypical answer, but it really works.|`|Df8wTpEKaa	I'm sorry you're going through this. I feel like this too. It's sad. I think it's just a phase every teen goes through with her mother. Was there a change in both of your lives at one point to cause this conflict? Mine was when my little brother was born. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I regret him being born because I don't. But I was always a daddy's girl, so when my brother was born (I was 10 so I was the only child for a long time) my mom paid extra attention to him to make him a mama's boy. She started acting ruder towards me and my dad, and we've been in many arguments. There are days I string out the arguments. If she has a bad day and says a little stupid comment, but nothing to freak out about, I blow up on her and that's what starts our fights.     Just ask yourself, "Is it really worth getting into another argument over??" if not, ignore her and go into the other room. If she follows you and starts blowing up on you or something, try to be the adult and tell her very maturely "Mom, I don't appreciate it when you yell at me. Can we please talk this out??" and see where it goes from there. It wouldn't hurt to say I love you more often either.     Just some suggestions. I hope this helps!! Good luck and I hope everything works out between you two in the future!!
ilrSUcMvaa	my sis and me are 14 years apart she is the older one. we dont notice the age gap that much. u could take your sis shopping or just ask her what she likes and do it with her? u could go to the movies or have lunch together and just talk. talking is always good.|`|kT5Bk0T8aa	since this is your sister this is not hard just sit down and talk to her and find things to do together and make her part of those things,she what she like doing and thoese things rather it's fishing are going to the park.|`|lbMUNNCuaa	I would start with making an activities list. You take turns writing things you like to do then what you've never done and would like to try.  Fashion shows, painting each others nails, shopping, bowling, writing a journal together....the shared journal is a great way to get closer. My sister and I spent more time fighting than anything else. Too bad I wasn't a good sister like u!|`|WkdW04cNaa	There are lots of things that you can do together.  You may have to do some things that are for younger kids but still fun.  I have 2 kids and they are 12 years apart and very close.  They play on the trampoline, play video games, watch movies, lots of games, cards, you just have to open your mind to it and you can figure it out :)
gfHutvEFaa	You better not. Why in the world do I have to pay for you?? No thanks. If you are going to receive alimony there is NO WAY tax payers should have to support you as well. No matter what, you can sit and welcome people as a greeter at WalMart or answer phones somewhere. Geeezzzzz.|`|RtkB46peaa	I certainly hope not.  If your ex doesn't fork over enough money to pay your bills, then I have to?    Anyway, if you're truly disabled, here's the website to apply:  http://www.ssa.gov/ssi/
XJlD2kPsaa	well, i doubt that your guy friend would well, have the same feelings for you, so i mean you have a girlfriend, just stick with her and well, your gonna have to live with the fact that your a bisexual. But stay with girls dude, your not gonna get accepted in society for being a bisexual, that's just how the society is, people will like make fun of you and stuff. So, well, i highly doubt your friend will have the same feelings and it'll just make it awkward in your friendship if you suddenly blurt "i love you" and you mean it, it might even ruin your friendship once and for all, just keep quiet i guess and stay with your girlfriend|`|AA11890253	If you think you can't be a real guy, as in a REAL  MAN then go for what your heart says, there is nothing can make anyone feel complete if your losing someone you really love.
2o3BHgCCaa	I'm not sure of prices there, but I do know it depends what you want.  Here prices start at $300 for on gound firworks, if you want big bangs up in the air like new years eve it is upwards of $1000. Even if you just wanted 2 minutes or something I think it is reasonable to expect tens of thousands when 1/2 hours on new years and such cost millions of dollars.|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	I've heard of $1000 per minute, and I don't really know what that gets you.
sq4BcGbIaa	"hey whats up?"   gets em every time.|`|eUf9e81eaa	Tell her that you love her and will like to be her friend. You can start by writing her first.|`|kTnlsvvMaa	Just hang out with her at school and say "hey whats up??" on facebook chat|`|KtUjmhVxaa	just be casual at first and send a message saying "hey whats up" then start a convo .... dont come on to strong at first
d8fSVX23aa	some people can't cope with the truth and so deny the truth as that way it's less painful. If it didn't happen in their heads then they don't have to deal with their feelings on the issue. Seeing you and your daughter will make them face the truth and they can't.     As always the victims suffering never ends. I'm so sorry you lost your family over this when you needed them most.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	I don't get it. Uncle pleaded guilty. If your family can't accept that there is nothing you can do.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	There is probably nothing you can do. You have to let them all go completely. Your daughter deserves your full support and energy. They are all sick, in denial and dysfunctional. The sooner you write them all off completely, the better. When you realize you don't need to carry their baggage anymore you will finally feel free of the mess. The fact you give a crap what any of them think is why you lost your husband. Your uncle will always have the desire to molest and your mom will always be co-dependent, don't let them drag you down one more minute. Take care of that little girl and f&^% them.
UgEYBvh8aa	I think you should just wait it out and see how it unfolds. It seems like you guys really connected, and if it's something that you're not going to be able to let go of, then it's worth a shot. She owes you an explanation for disappearing, if anything.    Keep in touch with her. Get her number if you don't already have it. E-mail her. Do anything you can to keep her and most importantly, tell her how much she means to you. Hold it out for at least a year and start planning a meeting. A date. Any date, even if it's years from now.     Just remember to hold on for as long as you can [without being too clingy of course] and let fate reveal itself. There's nothing else you can do.    Good luck!|`|AA10859724	Either she has really strict parents....or is in a relationship and the person found out about you two,thats what i first thought when you said she disappeared.i hope not.|`|6UeGyxNcaa	send her a message! Talk to her about whats been going on, and definatley tell her that  you miss her too! Ask to keep in touch!|`|sICqdaDzaa	When she appears again, ask her if there's something wrong.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	do something|`|HkyOtIeTaa	if you really think you love her, like 100% sure,  then when you turn 18 go visit her or something or just meet somewhere so you guys can talk face to face and see if the spark is still there.

You miss her, too. Hopefully you guys can come into contact again. Then you can see what happens after that. I wish you good luck.|`|Kgk1KX1daa	awwwww thats so sad!    you definately should tell her exactly how much you feel about her and tell her that you miss her too!     maybe you guys can see eachother again=]
RC6Dn6zoaa	Reading your question tells me that youre wanting to just live a peaceful life even after divorce, like anyone else, it really must be hard to maintain a normal life after and then seeing that your ex is still keeping the friction at a high is not much help. Nope,You do not have a legal obligation to speak with her or anyone in life, this is not written in stone. However, If your Ex is more comfortable w/ his new wife to give updates and if the situation was a peaceful one, unlike yours, then id say to hell w/ him if he doesnt want to talk and just go w/ it and just talk to the lady only when necessary. If you so choose to speak w/ her at your own will then I definatly wouldnt discuss any negative behavior about youre children and indulge in any discussion putting your children down or anything that is off the importance of the topic. Its not easy dealing w/ an issue that you HAVE to deal w/.  #1. I will say you are doing an awesome job by sending your ex documents and updates, (i couldnt imagine doing this myself) #2. Your children are lucky to have at least one mature adult in their life,it's not the issue, its HOW your handling it,(somebody has to,right?) why not make it YOU. In order to manitain the relationship youll need to do what is comfortable for you as well, sounds like they want a lot from you, they are not seeing how this is making you feel. Do somthing for you for a change, youre not married to this man any longer he has taken enough control. Do not allow him to control you any longer, youre a free and single women and raising your beautiful daughters who yearn for a role model who is mature and strong in all her ways.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I agree you should not have to talk to her. it is not her place to tel lyou about what your child did wrong at there house. Ignore her and only speak to him, if he isnt willing it isnt your fault|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No.  I wholeheartedly agree with the therapist.  I would suggest you drag your ex into court appointed mediation regarding the children.  You may have to do that by going in for a modification of custody - for you to have ALL the custody and supervised visits for him.  I know that isn't what you really want, but if it pushes you two into mediation you may have to make the legal motion.  I don't know if you can do that in your state but you can in mine and it works!  I've seen parents pull it together after that...I mean really, who wants to keep going back to mediation if they don't have to?|`|gjaPNWbTaa	You're not obligated to, but you are best speaking to a lawyer re: the law, and not therapists or Yahoo answers denizens.<br>  <br>  I notice there is not a lot of time between your divorce and your remarriage.  And he is bitter.  You left him for another man?  I don't know if that's the case, but I can understand his bitterness.|`|krQiDGCHaa	No, you don't have to, but why wouldn't you?  <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't understand all the stupid bitterness.  Get along for the kids sake!<br>  <br>  I am a step mother to an 8 year old boy.  He lives with me and my husband full time, and I do just about everything for the boy.  He sees his mother for about 3-5 hours each weekend.  I take him to the doctors, I sign ALL his school papers and report cards, etc.  I also do just about ALL the communicating with his mother.<br>  <br>  This is not because we forced it on her.  Typically, she will text or call to talk to me before she texts or calls to talk to my husband.  I think we just communicate more effectively.  We are kinder to one another, and communicate in a more friendly manner.  At first there was bitterness I think over someone else raising her child, then she got over it and now we get along quite well.  it's all about what is best for the kids.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it IS best for the kids if you can talk to both their father AND their step mother regarding everything.  The 3 of you should have conversations together, or at least talk to both of them equally.  The kids should see you getting along and being friendly with one another.  Who is it hurting for you to talk to their step mother?  Well, except your OWN bitterness of course.<br>  <br>  Seriously.  Let go of stuff, grow up, be the adult, and get along to the best of your ability with both your ex and his new wife -- for the sake of your kids.  It can be done.  Honestly, I haven't had a rough word, arguement, bitter thought, or angry conversation with my step son's mother in over 2 years.  And we intend to keep it that way.  It works out best for everyone -- especially my step son -- who can see the all THREE of his parents love him enough to get along with each other. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You NEVER have to talk to his wife, she has zero to do with you, your ex and your kids. You may need to haul him back into court to remind him of this.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Don't talk to her then. Hang up if she calls after you find out the kids are not hurt. <br>  Sounds easy to me. <br>  The bitterness is not good for the kids either.<br>  What else can you do to make their life better? (kids)|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	sounds to me like youre also parenting the father and the step mom.  that's very sad and stressing you out.  time for a calgon moment.|`|4HoVVCenaa	No, you don't. But if you want what is best for the children, you should.  Be the "adult" in this area with regard to ex and his wife. Your children will notice and learn that you aren't drawn into childish squabbles. If the kids act up because of the relationship issues, then they may need therapy or other social help. <br>  <br>  If that environment is that bad for them, you might want to see about getting full custody. Start documenting all instances that you observe of abuse... Then see a lawyer. He shouldn't be spanking them.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Not only aren't you obligated to talk to her, you're not obligated to call her their stepmom.  The legal and technical definition of a step-parent is a person who steps in when the natural parent has died.  You seem alive and kicking to me.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Just develop a need to get off the phone when they start complaining about your kids. It's childish to refuse to talk to their step-mom. Here's how you should try to look at it: is this good for my children?? It really doesn't matter whether you like it.<br>  <br>  It's not about "legally." It's about whether it's good for the kids. All these people who recommend that you go back to court are more interested in being right than being happy. It's a waste of time and money to go back to court. Just act like an adult and get along.
DjLFiZEwaa	He is better off without you.He deserves better than you.He will get over you and find someone that will make him Truly happy.Don't let this Im make you feel that you are worth getting back with.Your nothing but a cheater.Maybe one day you will get what is coming to you.|`|JgU9vaP4aa	It seems he still cares. it also seems you cheated on him. did you ever say you were sory for hurting him? maybe this is what he needs. I am sure your not an evil person. I am sure you were just not happy.<br>  Maybe text him back and tell him your saorry for hurting him but you two were not right for eachother. Tell him your sory for doing it the wrong way. And then add that you hope he finds a person that will love him. then say.Goodbye.<br>  <br>  if he texts again dont respond.|`|lzooHi0Baa	I can understand your disappointment in a relationship with a guy that would write such t/m after his girl was unfaithful and left him.   Women usually do not go for those drama queen guys who are so insecure, they are even willing to allow the woman be with another man as long as she does not leave him.   Forget about all this, leave him alone, he'll get over it.   Do I feel sorry for his next girlfriend|`|UFOdwXgfaa	He's trying to make you feel guilty and shitty of the fact that you called the quits.<br>  <br>  He doesn't want to take responsibility for his action so his putting all the blame on you<br>  <br>  Move on|`|ppF6oSCQaa	you tell him that you're so sorry for hurting him so deeply.  you didn't mean for things to work out that way---they just did.  you just weren't happy but you wish him all the best.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	You have already moved on.<br>  You can either respond or ignore him.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	He poured it on thick as one last ditch effort to get you back.  Live your life, forget about it and don't respond.  He can't move on well but you have.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I will assume you wern't happy for a few reasons and thats why you left. I would say you left so stay gone|`|f4RnGIeSaa	I hope you don't listen to those two idiot girls in here saying he is whining and pathetic.  Those are the types of girls everyone is better off without.<br>  <br>  He is hurt, he sounds like he is reaching, and yet he probably just needs to get his feelings out to you.  You were the one that wronged him, not the other way around, so the best thing for you to do is probably to just ignore it and let him move on.<br>  <br>  It will hurt him for a while, but it will help him get past you faster.|`|sHKeLaFsaa	I would guess you weren't happy, and he has learned and is willing to move on. So remember the good times and move on and let him move on. Going back isn't going to change who he is, and it isn't going to change how unhappy you were. If in fact you are engaged, then you found your happiness, right? So let this other guy go, and be happy.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	He's romantisizing the relationship and it's just a step in getting closure. It will probably take him some time since it sounds like he truly loved you. If you weren't happy, it's good that you moved on. If he keeps contacting you, get a ppo. Don't write him back. That will only encourage him to keep bugging you.|`|H9zCmv81aa	He sounds desperate, and i'm a guy... btw you shouldn't have cheated either that's wrong as well... ya'll don't sound like a good pair is i guess what i'm getting at.|`|Fa5OPBhjaa	Wow he really loves you...but sucks for you your engaged...you probably just missed out on a good guy.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	you sure messed up this poor guy, hope he finds better . Leave him alone.|`|8lwGjvQpaa	buy him a whore|`|O8TA4tMGaa	It is natural to grieve the relationship, especially when he wasn't the one who called it quits.  Don't allow yourself to feel any shame, guilt, or regret around cheating or around the sadness he's feeling right now.  His sadness is of his own choosing.  In life, when things happen, you can see them as obstacles or you can see them as opportunities but, either way, you choose.  He's choosing how he's taking this and he's choosing to blame himself and life in the past.  Eventually, he will make a different choice.  Either way, that's not your work; it's his.  Do what's best for you and move on with your life.|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Sounds to me he is trying to get closure and hopefully making you feel as bad as he did when you destroyed him by not only breaking up with him, but breaking his confidence by cheating on him.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	He is a real drama queen. If you weren't happy you shouldn't stay with him.|`|YzObEmUqaa	Deja Vu:<br>  Did you cheat on him with a rich guy?<br>  <br>  I think he is a fool for sending that email to you.<br>  <br>  If I were him?<br>  <br>  I would not even talk to you.<br>  <br>  Two timing tramp<br>  <br>  HAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	He seems a bit over the top to me.<br>  <br>  If you weren't happy you did the right thing.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	what a whiner. i wouldn't respond. he obviously needs to find himself and move on. if you talk to him at all, he'll think that theres still hope...and hang on.|`|NTUr0t3haa	It's an attempt to get you back for some reason. I would not respond to it, or just say, "I hope you feel better soon."
AdeD0xMuaa	Hey. I'm in a similar situation except it is my boyfriend that is always over my place. I pay $750 per month in rent and he pays $350 for his because he lives with roommates. But he only goes there once a month to get his mail.<br>  At first I thought he should just move in and help me with my rent instead but decided not to rush things due to financial reasons.<br>  I think that you should keep your apt or maybe get a cheaper one. STOP paying any of his bills. If he asks then tell him you think you should spend more time at your own place.<br>  Wait until you get married or engaged to move into his home.  It's good that he wants to be around you but also do things "right."<br>  Also - about the vacations - simply tell him what you told us. You can't afford it with all your other rent and bills. Maybe he will realize how much you are actually making and how much you are spending.<br>  Good luck. It's a tricky situation.|`|4HoVVCenaa	I agree with him.|`|lzooHi0Baa	This guy is pulling your leg and taking advantage of you.   He's got the best of both worlds.  Sex and financial help.   Why would he risk making a mistake and spoiling everything by letting someone he wants no commitment with come live with him.   Who cooks and cleans?   Are you also his maid?   If the answer is yes, kiss his butt goodbye and move on.
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Cozumel is very safe.  I think you are confusing it with Cancun the party nightmare capital.  It's a gorgeous location.<br>  <br>  You might consider doing a cruise ship wedding.  <br>  <br>  The temperature is perfect so close to the water.  I can't imagine how the previous poster was there on a 105 degree day.  Over the last 3 years the highest record temperature was only 94.  They have 6 days when a month when the temperature gets above 90.  And the record high ever according to this site is 102.  The temperature average year-round is between 82-89 and the average low is 68-74.  The average temperature during the day across all months is a perfect 85.  It's gorgeous weather and never that hot.  I've always been very comfortable down there.  Be aware August is the hottest month.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/MXQR0074" rel="nofollow">http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/bu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weatherreports.com/Mexico/Cozumel/averages.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.weatherreports.com/Mexico/Coz...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mexretire.com/location/cozumel/climate" rel="nofollow">http://mexretire.com/location/cozumel/cl...</a><br>  <br>  I've been several times on a cruise ship and Chankanaab Park is one of my favorite places.

Good luck and everyone will have a wonderful time.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  I have not been to a wedding there, only stopped there for a day while on a cruise.  <br>  <br>  The weather is nice....but VERY HOT!  We were there in July and it was 105 that day!!
KATCMfLSaa	hahah he problyy likes u and wantedd to make u jeliousss|`|LKjMAqXgaa	Well maybe both of you. Maybe neither of you. Or maybe one of you. Its hard to tell in these types of situations|`|d7vyYNLQaa	i think he was trying to make you jealous
0qSpreVyaa	Sorry, no offense to others... but i think most of the repliers missed the point.    Appearance doesn't matter. Or shouldn't matter. It's always a positive plus... but it's not necessary.    I'm 16 and this is from a guy's point of view, so... no, i'm not in middle school anymore, but... i think the same thing will apply anyway.    Now it is personality, that's what matters.    Now i will tell you what i find attractive, hopefully that will help.    I like a girl that is honest, caring, compassionate, intelligent, one that has a sense of humor and a sense of self-worth. However, i despise the girls that are egotistical. She must be willing to compromise and should be able to think for herself with out having to turn to someone to answer EVERY question.    It is not about the makeup or hairstyle... though that will attract guys momentarily, as soon as you open your mouth to say something, it could very well counter your appearance immediately.    Now... i hope it helps. Good luck!|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	I'm not attracted to girls in middle school. but if I were--            in middle school  , they would need to give a crap about school work and she would need be involved in an extra curricular activity that i'm in, because she likes it, not because she is trying to impress me.|`|gmvusL2gaa	friendliness, nice butt|`|AIftgLEGaa	In middle school i was attracted to mostly pretty, outgoing, fun types of girls.

I would be more attracted to good clothing, make sure not to over do yourself with makeup cause then it looks like your trying to hard and nothing to revealing, again lookes like your trying to hard.
IqoRBVUTaa	You can't, he has to convince his own self that he's making the wrong and selfish choice. I pulled threw in a matter of time, hopefully he will to. Just be there by his side to Comfort him at all times. Comfort, something I never had that would have helped.|`|PV8TqGGgaa	i don't know but u could invite him over and just be a really  great friend then he will understand that it is worth it not to run away.|`|84mMAYjxaa	Just let him run away. He'll prolly figure out it's really stupid within 20 minutes. He'll go home soon enough.|`|MRUuRTHeaa	I agree with the OP, you could say he could come to live with you (if you're not too far away). But you should tell him about the consequences of being a run away, if he has no place to run away to.  He could end up eating out of a dumpster, robbing someone and being put in jail, even selling himself to make money to buy food!  A lot of people don't realize what can happen when you have no place to call home.|`|NTWZ4rBsaa	tell him if you run away then you will be a hobo and sleep on the streets and tell him about the harsh and cold winters he will spend|`|7oKBEKAVaa	Tell him that no matter how angry he gets or his parents get, unless they are legitimately neglecting him he is only being selfish by making his parents worry about him if he DOES run away. It's just going to make them more upset, because he will (I'm guessing 99% likely) end up back at home a lot sooner than he expects. Save the trouble, put up with the parents, and do what they say. It'll make the entire family environment a lot more manageable for him. In the long run just remind him that parents are going to seem like jerks right now but he's approaching the arguments without an open mind. He needs to see things from his parents point of view, too, even if he doesn't accept it, it will still help him understand a little bit more.|`|273uR8MYaa	He will freeze to death in the cold. Tell him his home life is not that bad to freeze to death!!|`|7laNYydNaa	Tell your friend that there is no point in running away.Tell him that the only thing that will do is create more anger and tension at home...and that he won't be able to really do anything or find food

It sounds totally boring you poor thing:-)    Tell them you hate the french like us Brits do LOL|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Your parents only want the best for you, however they shouldn't force you to do something you don't enjoy.|`|YUHZsqkiaa	i think both,your sort of acting imature,so i can see why they won't take your opinion into consideration,and that you haven't bothered to work on the projects yet?  thats just downright proving your irresponsible,.|`|AA11788494	Well your parents are trying to help you.  They are in the wrong only if you told them you don't want to take French.|`|qRuXJI2jaa	If your mom is so interested in French have her go with you and talk to her about how you dislike it and show her why. If she won't go then all you can do is try to talk to your parents and hope you can get them to understand.

Also tell them the ela project is important.|`|WU0C11FNaa	Well if you don't want to take it, then you are right.

Try talking to your parents.|`|8H6HM7zHaa	well if your failing in school the your parents are right for sending you there but if you have work that you have to do tell them that and if they still won't listen to you and they try to bring you tonight just hide from them :D|`|cttRd8Yqaa	if you have no interest in learning french then you shouldn't be forced to but learning a second language is a good thing.|`|tLIxAZEYaa	you!(unless you cant reschedule)|`|fqpezi4kaa	You would be right,  you have other work that needs to be done and only a little time to do it. plus you parents shouldn't make you take something that you don't want to take|`|pi5mmZj9aa	Well maybe you should ask them why they are having you take French class and you should keep trying to tell them that you don't like it.|`|69ZcfyM5aa	In a future, you'll think they were rigth...|`|RmxigYGBaa	you but you shouldnt have waited tell the last miniute to do your project|`|CaQ6IShSaa	it's your life, there would be no reason to take French if you don't expect to go to France or another place that mainly uses he french language in the future.|`|AA10870669	your parents. You might thing french is boring now but in the future it will give you and advantage over other people. Though French is not widely used around the world except by terrorist, French,and quebec. It will give you the advantage of been able to work in France, a terrorist association, or in Quebec....|`|4SXoHQKraa	In my opinon i think yer lucky to be taking french :/  but just break the ice to yer parents; tell'em  you're not that interested in french anymore and  that you have other stuff that are more important to do  like the project yer doing :)|`|vxJxExCJaa	well you need to talk to your parents about this major ela project and hopefully they will understand and you would not have to go to french class for the day. you should also really sit down and talk to them about not wanting to go to these classes. you cannot be forced to do something you do not want to do.|`|QsBHaPLdaa	Hmmm... from an outsiders point of view i dont really think it is a case of who is right and who is wrong. As a parent i can see that they think they are doing the best for you they obviously want you to explore evry avenue they can offer you and it is a great skill to have... however, if you genuinely dont enjoy it i doubt you ever will so it probably is just a waste of money and its obviously building some resentment between you and your parents. The best advice anyone could give you is to sit down and talk with them, this way you can explain why its not beneficial to you at the moment and they may even respect your maturity and listen to you! Good luck! x|`|KQzkIzNvaa	tell them your ela project has to take priority .... and also who the hell needs to speak french??? crazy ....|`|hUYaaXBvaa	tell them that you have an important school project  its just dropping one day's lesson  and if you can;t well its only an hour, i am sure you can get your work done the rest of the day  i was like this with piano  trust me, in the long term you'll be glad you stuck with it|`|1hS1pQz5aa	Personally, I think YOU are right. Projects should come before extra stuff, such as your French class. You should talk to your parents and try to compromise. Say that you hate French but am willing to try some other activity.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	Ask your parents if they are trying to live their dreams through your life because your not interested in French right now|`|2F9EcT7Haa	you'll be glad you took it in the long run. and honestly its only an hour.|`|1FTFCtaNaa	You are. What is more important, School or an outside class with an organization? School is, of course. Tell your parents that you have a BIG ela project and that you hate french. Tell your parents straight up or try and make a point. If that doesn't work, start yelling.|`|zMDnzS9Haa	You, its your life not your parents.    They need to stop pushing you into going, as learning a language is not fun, bu could be useful.    Make a list of for and against going, and see what comes up tops.    Be mature about whatever decision you choose as its obviously important to your family you go to French class.    x|`|sLgI3cRpaa	does it really  mattr dey will love u and u will love em back  just drop it lol  =]|`|gnWodF2jaa	Complaining won't get you anywhere.

A0r2qWaHaa	Hey girl!    I am 20 and I am shy too sometimes.  It is part of who I am.  Some guys even find it attractive!  In order to not be shy you have to accept yourself for who you are so then others can accept you.  Pretend to be someone who is outgoing, like you are an actress playing a part, but don't lose your true personality.  If you say you are going to be outgoing and talkative today, than just do it and follow your instincts.  You don't have to worry about others judging you!|`|raXQDWaraa	I am like that too. You got to stop thinking about embarrassing yourself and humiliating yourself and don't think about anything bad happens.I hope this helps and Good Luck.|`|AA10778911	try joining a club|`|uooSqefhaa	Hey hun!    I'm 18 and a senior in high school I have moved school because of the army and i was really shy too, then i just started talking to people who looked like they would be great friends with me. I'm still shy around people but when i talked to some of my friends back home they gave me very good advice to help me out and it worked for me. Just be your outgoing self that you are at home even though its hard for you. Take it step by step and day by day it will work out. I hope everything works out for you.     Good Luck|`|Yrkl80zwaa	Be over confident and try as hard as you can to put your self out there.|`|HcBp3cFDaa	I used to be shy 2.  if you make more friends, you will be really outgoing!!

AdeD0xMuaa	Yes - ask him about it.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Maybe he's really gay and as long as he don't touch it, he can pretend it's any hole he imagines.|`|a59cPOyBaa	Yes. Bring it up and talk to him about it. maybe he's shy or inexperienced. The best think to do in any relationship is to have good Communication. Let him know it bothers you.|`|bp6ud1AHaa	do  shave cause if u dont maybe thats why lol <br>  ask him why he doesnt..|`|gd5XGTakaa	shave... stay clean then ask him... thats your best bet. but that is odd|`|0Opi3SWKaa	tell him to touchit. tje only way he knows what u want is if u tell him.|`|rCOq9Sr1aa	Communication is always best, even though sexual topics can be awkward at times.  If it bothers you enough to be asking the rest of the world, you should probably tell him. =)  If you are uncomfortable asking him, maybe, in the heat of the moment, try gently moving his hand down there and see the reaction?  But even then, if the reaction isn't what you'd hope for, it may make you feel worse.  Your best bet is to simply say something.  I know from experience, some guys just aren't really touchy-feely in that way.  My ex wouldn't touch my vagina with his hand if I paid him and he was not very good at talking about things like that.  It was a difficult discussion because it made him feel weird, but he finally just blurted it out that it wasn't his thing.  Enough said, I guess. =)  Guys can be a little surprising at times, just ask him.  Maybe he has no idea that he's skipping a step that most of us love.  Honesty is never a bad thing. =)|`|dbk8KiKUaa	Don't ask the question here> Talk to him and tell him how you feel! Let him know that as his intimate girlfriend, you expect and enjoy certain things and ask his reason for not touching you there.<br>  <br>  At the same time, ensure that your personal hygiene is in check and it is the way he likes it. Hope u guys discussed that too.<br>  <br>  DON'T feel odd, work on sorting it out|`|lVOBpO92aa	He is likely inexperienced. If you need something from a lover either tell them or show them.

Obviouslly its bothering you. How long can you go through a relationship like this? If all else fails..dont touch his!!

It seems to me you have to chose one frnd or the othr so just keep silent if you want Tasha and spill if u wand Charline ,cause Charline will brk up if u wnt tell her the truth since she probably knows your hidin somin. nd gd luck you're gonna need it heh heh!!!!!Oh and rd this bk called Mirror Image in the Charmed series it tells you how 3 people keep secrets and the other one senses it and people lose their lives cause of it!!!|`|wqchA8B7aa	You've got to tell.

Shame on the two of them for cheating! That's what they get. Put yourself in Charline's place would you want her to tell you! I would.... They are both pieces of SH*T. Do the right thing and tell! Also, Tasha is not a real friend. If she was she wouldn't be sleeping with Charline's husband! What if it was your husband? What is to make her not go after him???

I would also keep this woman who was in bed with my other friends husband at arms length.  Just think this could have been your husband.|`|emKXU1QFaa	If they laughed about it they probably wanted to get caught.  She may have thought he husband was cheating with Charline and decided to do the same to her.  <br>  <br>  Since you know and are friends with all parties, I'd say yes, give the key to Tasha's husband and say 'Please don't ask me to check on your family again, your wife was home and I found out things I didn't need to know but you might.  I suggest you talk to her about what she was doing and with whom while your baby was sick in the next room.'  <br>  <br>  I'd then get the heck out of it and stay away from all them for a while.

I don't have time for them. I avoid those who believe that they are all that; because ususally they're not. I don't do drunks, as I stay away from alcohol.

DK3wRkkwaa	i don't understand how people can treat their own flesh and blood like this. and my condolences to you. i'm sorry you've had to put up with this and good job on going through to see the light by getting into a university and being successful. i think your mother is so resentful because she's been abused for so long. she's probably never been loved and therefore, doesn't know how to love someone else if she doesn't love herself. she's been abused for so long that she probably doesn't know who to trust. don't get me wrong, she shouldn't be feeling sorry for herself. she needs to get up and realize that as a daughter you really care about her. she needs to open up her eyes, maybe with a little help, and see that throughout all the sorrow she went through, there could be happiness with her children, or at least with you, the only one that made a life for herself. i don't think its completely her fault that she resents you, she just might be emotionally traumatized. then again, this is totally my opinion and i've been blessed to say that i have a mother who truly loves me. my grandmother was a little resentful of my mother, but not to this extent. and lastly, i am also of west indian descent, from guyana, and i know that most west indian mothers (not all of them) do not care for their daughters. they expect them to know things without being taught. based on my mother's stories, i've come to realize that. anyway, i hope you can just move on and be independent and realize that what people say to you, whether it be your mother or a stranger, that their words do not make you or break you. only what you say or do can prove them all wrong.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	By the sound of it, you would be happier if your mother was not in your life. She seems very resentful of what you have managed to accomplish without her, and despite her, even.     I think, however, that you are in danger of letting this unhappy childhood define you as an adult. You are gay, okay, and you don't want children, also okay. But what about relationships with other adults? At some point, someone you love may want to have a family with you ... would you let your own past get in the way of that? This may sound like the most obvious thing in the world, but we are talking about childhood blueprinting here - not all family relationships are not what happened between your parents, and family dynamics are all different.     Don't let your mother's resentment poison your own personal life, you didn't let it poison your professional life.|`|w29tsXLUaa	I can't understand your mother. She has had a terrible life one way or the other.    I think just live your life and be happy as possible. Do not keep making yourself miserable over this. It will be hard but the negatives from your mother are not good for you.    Stay in contact with her because it is obvious you love her. Accept she is as she is.     Try to look at it from her angle. She feels a complete failure I should think.    That's the best I can do hope it help. Good luck. Be happy.
VERrlErvaa	I totally believe in "soul mates" - I found mine 12 years ago and we have been together ever since.  We have 4 kids.    She and I are chalk & cheese in some ways - but we also have similar tastes in others.  There was definitely a connection from the first moment I saw her and what started out as a friendship blossomed into something truly powerful.    If you have found someone that truly loves you; and you feel the same way - then perhaps it is meant that you're to be together.  Mind you, I was a lot older when I found mine - and I had to do a lot of fishing to find 'the one'...     You will know your "soul mate" when you meet them... It's just a natural occurence that very few people take heed of and end up losing out.|`|ww9Wx0mwaa	Every nice people has a believe in that,..  only people who are uncultured and living out for one night stand and short term affairs will hate this word "soul mate"    hai its nothing to do with chemistry,.its all attraction due to our liking,.  when u dream or has a thought abt something and when the time u meet such similar thing out u may get attracted to it,.same here when u have some idea abt a guy or girl whom u like character and appearance wise,.when u meet such guy or girl in real u may get attracted to them and fall in love,.we can call this as "love at first sight".    i think he loves u,.and it may happen our sub-conscious may say like she is u r wife before or she is for u like that.,.,it happens to few.,.,i have personally experienced that when u meet u r soul mate u may feel like taken and they own u like that even if its a distant relationship like chat or on phone,.    actually love has a connection with all our chakras as per spiritual learning,.when a person fall in such deep love without even knowing about the opponent just on first site or after few meeting,.its called attraction from u r inner self,.the magnetic pole of u r body gets attracted to there magnetic poles,.even without a touch without seeing each other,.    we have no answer than this.,.,only god knew how it happens,.but as a astrologist i say .,.,planetary placement plays a major role in such attraction and love,.if u r planets are so friendly with that girls planetary placement and her placement is so cool with u r s.sure u both will be lovers forever,.but in some case it may even differ like,.only for a few years there planets will support for example,.if u have a friendly period of planet aspect with a guy u may find him as lover only for that planet time,.may be it may end up in break after 1 year or 2 year in some case 5 to 10 years,.as a professional i could suggest u.,.,learn about guna milan in astrology which is a calc to find how u match with u r guy,.it may help u to find long lasting love life.    wishes,  Sun.|`|KATCMfLSaa	yeaa it soundss like a good thingg|`|aT5J358Taa	Yes! very good!|`|y6vcfJ0paa	yeah but mine doesn't feel the same way about me!!! :( dont spend to much time over him cuz loves gonna get u down!|`|D35SFHbTaa	Sounds good to me.

cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I don't think you have ever been truly, madly, head over heels in love before. You are likely too young to have experienced this kind of love yet - the kind where they want to spend their lives together, build a home together, have children, the whole bit. That's why people get wrapped up in it.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	My parent's divorce is not encouraging ,at your age, my age people are not entirely sure what they want out of a partner ,and relationships move fast.     I think even love has to  be realistic if you are ever going to consider it in your life, and I think that love is a considered effort, that you put time , and work into. I think that it is a conscious effort to show your feelings, and to discover ways to make yourself valued in a relationship, as well as show your partner that you value her in a relationship.     The older we get, or the better we know ourselves, the more we know what is worth fighting for, and we fight better for what we want . You just have to find some one ready to settle down.     I'm not too sure about my future as I have serious anxiety problems, but I hope for a better future, one with love, and once someone gives me that I for one  know that I wont ever let go of it.    It is really just about choosing the right reasons to get involved with someone, then searching for more within a relationship to keep it strong.Get involved with certain activities, interests of the partner, and show love, concern . Love yourself, and let the partner love herself. In turn love each other.    Don't hold people back from their dreams, ambitions, and self love, let the partner be who they are, and if it's right you'll find love, if its a little off , you can compromise, if its way off then I suggest you don't marry the person, and do move on.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	agreed.!    everyone starts dating too young, falls "in love" too quickly, and then break up and move on just as fast.    i think everyone needs to quit looking and just wait for love to come to them.|`|0zjkRZXDaa	cuz people's hearts get involved...and other body parts...|`|FKf67HXaaa	you have obviously never been in love, or you have a strong, stable, and good personality. Its good to be like you, or the way you feel. I wish I could be.|`|fHTvjaYtaa	You need to deal with relationships every day as they go.  They don't always last and other things  jump up.  Yes, just move on.  Stay friends and move along, please.  I met my hubby when I was 33....still good friends with my partners along the way.......We have been married for 30 yrs.  Best  wonderful partner and the love of my live.    All relationships do not end in the for the rest of your life.    Take care, and good luck.|`|D6KMUndOaa	because people just eat there feelings  haha  honestly i dont know thats what i just heard off a tv show|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	I totally agree with ya, people are so obsess over relationships but if you can live on your life when you were age 1 to 13, than why cant you live your life without a specific other?|`|rh12tX8Naa	It sounds like you've never been in love. Do you seriously think people want to fall and love and then break up? NO! It's not the best thing in the world.|`|AIftgLEGaa	i doubt anyone can really give a correct answer to this question. but for me, its just the feeling of having something lost in your life. when you lose a friend or a family member from death or them moving away, there is a feeling of lose. i would imagine its similar. (but not as strong as something like death).|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i agree with you about the love thing    but people get all bent out of shape over relationships because they spent a lot of time, emotions, words and whatever else into it    they cant just forget about it and move on  its just not how it works  there is a like a kind of mourning period to it  except no one died  the relationship died|`|AA12108398	I agree, yet disagree. I've never been in love and maybe you haven't either. You need to experience things for yourself and see what the big deal is. Don't force a relationship though. You seem like a girl who will be ready when the right guy comes along and who won't rush into anything or say false comments based on immature emotions.    frighteningtruth.webs.com|`|KkKCKu06aa	I agree, once you're in love, and when they break up with you, or it doesn't end well.    look back and remember asking this question.|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Clearly you are a girl who has never been in love, so you can't really judge people who bend over backwards to make their relationships work. When you are in love, you are prepared to do anything to maintain your relationship because that person is the most important person in your life. These people that are saying they are in love with just about every person they get with, think they are in love, maybe because they think that is part of having a relationship, but they can't be really. If it was true love, they wouldn't split up and find "love" with other people.  I do agree with you though, the abuse of love by teens who are in simple lust, seemingly lowers it's value somewhat in general... but to me it hasn't lost any value and I find it to be an amazing wonderful thing.|`|WpDBNcdcaa	yeah, a 22 yrs marriage all shot to hell....just give me a hole|`|KlIhfO6naa	I agree|`|c7ZSVByfaa	yeh totaly agree wif you hun|`|v1worPvIaa	Well when you get cheated on and you thought that you could trust that person, it's a disapponitedment, then you feel stupid that you did and that you should have seen it coming and so on and so on.

I am one of them. It can really suck. But when you feel that way about someone...it's great. I wouldn't be any other way.|`|ICjBorriaa	I agree, relationships are a bit over rated. I think as long we like the people we hang out with that's all that matters really. I think at a minimum as long as wee can say the other person is cute and nice that's all we can expect really.|`|XwtZXbY5aa	Well Ashlee .. some people..  they fall 100% in love .

Welcome  byee|`|mQlYlQ4Paa	people get to emotionaly involved its all a bit of fun x|`|B94G0Y7haa	i agree, but sorta disagree? i mean, its true how people kind of make a big deal out of it so that the real thing really isn't that special. but in my case, i fell for someone accidentally. i mean i wasn't "looking for love" or anything. no way. it just sorta hit me:\ but i don't get why they act that way either, i mean i would be very sad, but it wouldn't completely reck my life. i'd be sad for a couple days and then move on with my life, maybe even move on right away. i think people get so bent out of shape about it because they make a huge deal out of it and call it "love". then when its over there all depressed and then they see someone hot and its "oh my gosh im in love!" all over again. yeah, i don't like when people do that either. but yeah, love is a great thing when its real, and obsessing over it just ruins everything. so yes i agree with you:) but the people who were really in LOVE, they kinda have a right to be depressed for a couple days, but yes, they should move on. but i get why, i mean, you feel like you'll spend your life with someone and you see your future then it ends and your blind at first. it just takes a little while to get over strong feelings like that.    answer my question?:http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=AqsN...|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Most relationships...especially younger ones throw the L word around and often wo meaning...and without understanding what love really is. Love is an amazing and complex feeling, and i promise anyone out there they will feel ashamed for using it so falsy when they meet someone that truly shows htem waht love is. Love isnt about just being around someone, or calling ur self "bf and gf"... love is about many things, and can be shown in many ways. Relationships are the building blocks of your future, sure some fale but eventually one doent for most people, its like shopping around for your match, the one you want to spend life with. Life is short, and to beatiful to spend alone.. thats the main reason why people try so hard in relationships.. because when you find the one its the most amazing thing in the world, notihng can ever compare.. knowing that your with someone who truely loves you.. who is willing to go through not just the good but the bad, not just the easy times..but the rough ones too...to have someone who can look at you and love you for not just your best qualties but your faults aswel...to know that they arnt going anywhere..no matter what and you can trust them with all who you are.    I think the heartache involved in searching for this, is more then worth it.    Hope this is wut you were looking for!|`|0BioKSmaaa	i knwww...its pretty messed up :S   speaking only for me ~ I usually don't like getting close to someone, but the one time I did, well, he broke my heart when he cheated on me, when you trust someone with a porcelain figurine it takes forever to stick it back together when they've dropped it...that's all I can really say about the matter...    Edit..    well i've never really had a...plain relationship...that's just a waste of time..either you love the person...or you don't   people who are 'broken-hearted' over a breakup from a relationship they never gave 100% in are just doing it to get attention or because they think it would be appropriate - that's just my opinion    i get what you mean though, so many times I feel like the world has forgotten what it truly means to love    Edit again (this question has really got me thinking here ashes lol)     Some people naturally give their hearts away so fast that it seems like they don't even value it - i have a friend who does that all the time and it really is in her nature, but i also have a friend who goes out with any guy, claims that she's doing it for love but when everyone can see that she just does it for attention...a lot of times people who attach themselves easily are actually just clingy people who need the approval of others to be happy - i know i'm not really answering your question and the whole point of my edit was actually to just say that even though love does hurt I have to agree that "it's better to love and get hurt than to never have loved" - i think i paraphrased it tho :P    again, very interesting question :)
xarKlp0Oaa	I can talk when I am angry but I usually end up saying things that I regret and then I have another problem. I think that it is best to waite a little while and cool off a little bit so that this doesn't happen to you.|`|0F8hauikaa	I've learned (the hard way) that it's best to hold your tongue in anger lest you say things you regret and will most likely be reminded of in the future. It's best to think before speaking and then, do so with diplomacy, kindness and understanding, if even the other person doesn't necessarily deserve it. Easier said than done sometimes.  <br>  <br>  A wise man once said, "You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.”|`|zHmZkMStaa	I have great difficulty talking when I'm angry.  If I even try, I end up sputtering and not making any sense.  I've learned to walk away, pace a bit, collect my thoughts, and then deliver a zinger one-liner that gets my point across before storming off into the horizon :)|`|0Opi3SWKaa	no. u have to be somewhat calm to have a productive conversation.|`|tr2JSLQqaa	yes.
YuVSDBkzaa	You mother shouldn't be correcting you around your daughter, it undermines your authority (as you are learning first hand). I would have a private talk with your mom and let her know that you don't mind her input and correction, but she needs to do it privately so your daughter doesn't get the wrong impression. She may have been genuinely concerned about your daughters healthy and comfort (referring to the clothing) but just remind her that you know what's best for you daughter and appreciate her advice. It really sounds like this is a communication problem that can be easily resolved. It makes a HUGE difference in how you approach other people as well as your tone of voice. Try to explain this to your mom. Tell her she needs to respect you as your daughters mother more and talk to you like an adult instead of correcting her like a young mother who doesn't know anything. But be very gentle in your approach.|`|UinOWcMUaa	They just care for you ... be a good mom and learn everything you can !|`|7cjqT33Baa	I'd decide if their questioning had valid reasoning behind it.  Maybe you are over-disciplining and too mean.  Do you spank?  Do you use a threatening tone?  Discipline is not meant to be a release valve for your anger, it's meant to keep a child out of danger and doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  If my parents /grandparents were critical of my parenting without any valid points behind it and they were just doing it to be critical, I'd put a stop on it pronto.  I'd tell them it's my child and if they have constructive advice, that is fine, but that they aren't to second guess my parenting all the time and never in front of my child.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Usually I don't pay attention to what people say BUT, if everyone around me is saying the same thing then I have to admit they might be on to something. You can't be right and everyone else around you is wrong. <br>  <br>  Grand-parents will always be super-sensitive when it comes to their grand-children discipline. They all think we're too tough, that's normal. <br>  <br>  I think they're doing it without knowing how hurtful it is to you. <br>  <br>  You can always tell your mother: <Mom, you went through raising me, you did a great job, so have some faith in me doing a job as good as you did.> Remind your mom that when she was your age she was learning along the way as you're doing.<br>  <br>  ADD: A dear friend of mine had a child at 16 y/o. She was a great mom to her little girl cause she allowed her own mother to watch over them and she always listenned to her advices. Your mother has more experience then you, she sees things you don't, don't shut her out. Yes, it's now your previledge to raise your daugther as you wish but do not overlook the advice of people with greater experience.|`|qSSiV0mmaa	I think all parents do this.  Just do what you know is right for your child.  My mom use to get on my case because I did not send my son to a private school which cost about $3000-$4000 a year.  But when I was young she home schooled me & then ended up sending me to public school & I had to  start a grade behind because I was far behind the kids my age.  I think she might regret some of the mistakes she made with me & doesn't want me to make the same mistakes with my son.  Just take in everyone advise & then decide what is best for your child.  You can not go wrong when you put your child first.  Good luck.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Teen moms...gotta love 'em for being so self-centered they can't truly see the BIG PICTURE.  <br>  <br>  I have yet to meet a teen mom that really parents well.  Sorry - but it's the reality of the situation.  <br>  <br>  I think if that many people are on your case about it - they are for good reason.  Try taking some parenting classes or join a mother's group so you can work on your parenting skills.|`|AA10420452	i Truly feel that without hearing both sides to this. that no one can give you an honest answer.and being your asking this makes me think that you should stop take time out.to see what your doing and how you are doing it.you will know if you stop and think hard about it. good luck|`|SfGyzMSFaa	"I don't know if it is just me being defensive or if it is them being critical? What do you think?"<br>  <br>  I wonder if it could be a little bit of both; you may feel a little defensive to any comments about your parenting, and your mom and grandmother might be a bit critical. I think it is normal for older mothers to offer comments to younger mothers; our moms and grandmothers have done this for generations. It is a sort of support system for parents; however some are better at sharing their knowledge than others, for example some are too free with the advice or say it in a way that seems critical. On the other hand, younger moms sometimes lack confidence, and feel that every piece of advice is putting them down or makes them feel like they are not doing a good enough job. <br>  <br>  Try to be patient with yourself and with your older family members. It is fine to ask that they offer advice privately. On the other hand; it doesn't hurt to at least consider what they are saying. <br>  <br>  It might help if you could spend time with other young mothers. Maybe take a parenting class, join a mommy and me class, or have play dates. When you have questions; chat with your child's pediatrician, don't be afraid to ask questions.|`|YPsBEwlDaa	I know what you mean. I was there once. When I had my 1st daughter I was 21. @ 21 my mother always told me what to do & what not to do. It got to the point she was telling my daughter " go to _____ " (my name ) instead of saying  ' go to your mom " I got tried of it. Now @ 37 yrs old and w/ 4 children. My mother STILL SOMETIMES TELLS ME THINGS But I just either tell her I'm in charge let me make my own decisions!! <br>  <br>  So if you can try not getting mad @ them and just tell them let me make my own decisions w/ my daughter. Let them know that they already raised their children and let  me raise mine my own way!<br>  They just care. You can also let them think your taking their advice. <br>  Good Luck|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Oh god i've been there and still a little bit. I'm a young mother too and my family tries to correct me. I guess a lot of people go through this a lot but in my case my husband kind of took care of things, he's is a really intimidating person and when he doesnt like something he would tell you so that kind of stop my parents from involving themselves in our parenting problems.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that parents can tell you some things but not everything. It's your child now and it's your turn to be a mother not them (again) and your child is supposed to respect you first than anyone else. Just have a talk with them and let them know that now it's your turn to learn and teach your child what you want, that you don't mind advice or some opinions but they always have to have a limit.|`|djUMvICoaa	Isn't great that everybody has opinions?  Yet none of them has written the book about it.  Take it all with a grain of salt, they mean well, but sometimes even well meaning people can come off as being know it alls.  Yet they have the experience to back them up, they did it once, but nobody said they did it right.  I think you have to smile and say thank you, I'll take that into consideration.  Sometimes giving them their validation is going to make them feel good, that you acknowledged their wisdom in the matter, even if you don't do anything about it, you took it into consideration.  One day you will be in their shoes too, and things might come out right or taken right.  give them a little slack, and a smile.  Even you will  feel better  with the smile.|`|pxOzlLhYaa	I agree with Caleb. I have been in this situation with my children. My problem was that my family (mainly mother) was so used to me asking her for advise which was extremely helpful, and to an extent being "involved" in some of the decisions I made early on that she felt that she was helping me raise my son. When in fact I am his only mother and ultimately every decision i make regarding my child is MINE to make. <br>  Yes your parents/ grandparents are entitled to their opinion, but if you do not want their advise then you need to tell them so. They will not be happy with you, but you need to get this straight before they are causing problems with your children undermining your authority. The only person that has any relevant say in your decisions with your child is that child's father. And if you are not with him, then once you marry you will turn to your husband to help with parenting.  <br>  And it DOES NOT matter your age because any new mother has to start somewhere and learn as they go.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Our parents always think they "know better", and there are always things that they would do differently. The difference is that some parents mostly keep it to themselves, and others are vocal about voicing every little disagreement. It seems that your parents are the latter. Don't worry! Do what you feel is right, use your judgment, and you'll be fine. Yes, in all truth, there ARE things that parents know better... simply because they've been down this road before, and have a lot of experience. Don't disregard their advice and insight outright. But do run it through your own brain, pick out the useful bits, and don't feel guilty if you do things a little differently. There's almost always more than one way to do something.<br>  <br>  Example - my brother and my sis-in-law have a 3-year-old; she's not working now, staying home with the kid. Her mom has been bugging her to go back to work, because if "something happened" to my brother, my sis-in-law would have "no means" to support herself. On the other hand, my mom is horrified by the prospect of taking this very young child to daycare, and is trying to convince my SIL *not* to go to work, as my brother makes enough money to comfortably support them. The difference is in the life experiences of the two women: my SIL's dad died when she was young, and her mother raised two kids entirely on her own; she had to be self-sufficient. My mom and my dad raised children together, and my mom stayed home throughout much of our childhood. So you have two life experiences, two view points, that are mutually exclusive, each having its own pros and cons. Bottom line is, my bro and SIL need to decide for themselves what feels right to *them*. No matter what they decide, one of their moms will be unhappy, and will be getting on their case about it. But what can you do? That's life. They're not "young" parents, BTW, my bro is 31 and sis is 28. These situations will come again and again, over things large and small. Listen to the advice, but make the decision yourself.<br>  <br>  P.S. And yeah, regarding the discipline, my grandma was also a "go-to" person when I got disciplined by my parents. She was always very protective of me, and took my side - or at least listen to me complain. It's super-common, I think. Grandparents spoil, that's for sure.
JEOBrEbFaa	You have only been out with him twice, yet you say you love him? I am sorry, but in my experience that is impossible. Attracted to him, yes, but you can't know him very well after two dates. It takes time to know somebody. I don't mean to sound patronising, but I guess I do...<br>  Anyway, you feel strongly for this guy, If he felt the same for you, believe me, he would find time for you in his busy schedule. Besides, I don't understand why once a week is worse than never.<br>  You will get over him. You have been on two dates and after both of them he broke up with you! Come on, is that "Mr. Perfect"? No, it is not. Fill your life with activities and good friends, and probably you will soon find a guy that is much more perfect than this one.

Just say you haven't heard from him in ages an wanted to catch up.|`|lNiv7Cupaa	Wait if he want's to speak etc he'll come to you, just be therefore him when he does, don't admit to stalking - however you could just drop him a message saying "hi how goes it stranger long time no see/hear?"|`|ZZkInusMaa	well just say you couldent help hearing he broke up with who ever and after that just talk to him if you get were im coming from ...|`|byTXglKiaa	He's ignoring you for a reason which leads me to believe that once you two were close.Sometimes it's best just to leave them alone. They either come around or they don't. I know how you feel because I've been there myself. You could just move on or wait and see what transpires because if you try too hard it could just end up making things worse.
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	We're having a buffet dinner and still having the cocktail hour.<br>  <br>  The cocktail hour is to occupy the guests time before the dinner starts while the bride & groom are off taking photos and having a little quiet time.<br>  <br>  If you don't need/want that bit of time for yourselves, then go ahead and skip the cocktail hour and go right into the reception.|`|AA11380378	I had a cocktail hour and offerred a meal. The mingling occurs during the cocktail hour, not the meal service.<br>   It's a chance for you to talk to your guests and the guests to tall to each other, sociallize and relax. During the reception, everyone will be seated, eating or dancing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|i3PGjRRfaa	ALWAYS keep cocktail hour.<br>  <br>  The whole point of going to a wedding is getting drunk and stupid...............|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Buffet dinners are not mingling events where just appetizers are served. They are simply allowing guests a choice of what they want to eat rather than having it already decided for them, but it is still a full meal. They still sit down to eat the entire meal. So a cocktail hour before a buffet dinner is no different than one prior to a plated dinner. <br>  <br>  Whether you keep the cocktail hour or skip it is entirely your decision. Also, guests will get up and mingle after dinner regardless if you have a plated meal or a buffet.|`|D9ufwiMXaa	you should keep the cocktail hour.<br>  A buffet style dinner only means that people make their own plates and return to their table and eat at the same time as everyone else.<br>  At my wedding we had the cocktail hour and buffet dinner, it worked out well. The cocktails and hors d' oevres were served while the buffet was being "put together" if you will then our MC announced that it was approaching time for dinner and the the head table would get their food first and each additional table would follow, so everyone ate at the same time just like a regular plated dinner.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I think you should ditch the cocktail hour.  The bride and groom usually are never at the cocktail hour anyway, so no one will really get to mingle with you and you won't get to enjoy what you're paying for.  And since your reception is going to have alcohol and the buffet is going to give people a chance to mingle, I would save your money and maybe have some hors d'oeuvres before the buffet.  Have like an appetizer buffet and than the dinner buffet if you really want to have some hors d'oeuvres.|`|bzfv8aT9aa	I would definitely do whatever I wanted to do. Your opinion counts more than anyone elses.|`|LqpNve02aa	I had a cocktail hour and a buffet.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Keep it, without a doubt. Congratulations on your marriage! have a nice day!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	a buffet dinner doesn't necessarily mean people mingle.  they get a plate of food and sit at their table and eat.  just like a served banquet style dinner but cheaper ;)  so yes, you should have a cocktail hour with finger foods, cheese & fruit etc.  and you only need to pay for open bar during the cocktail hour, then you can switch it to cash bar for the rest of the reception.  no one expects you to pay for everyone's drinks for 5+ hours.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Keep it, this will give the guests something to do while you are taking pictures. :)
ZxCLrB1Taa	Best way, is to just tell them. Let them know that it wasnt planned, it just happened, and you are sorry if you disapointed them, tell them wether or not you want to keep it, and make sure it's your choice and no one else's, if they love you they will prob be mad at first, but then you guys will work through it as a family
x59uoIpMaa	Leave her alone and move on. Shes stupid.  Trust me, one day she will realize what she's doing wrong, and she'll look back to what happened w/you and realize why you walked away. You are not in the wrong. I cant stand being friends with people like that either.|`|bgi0AtiFaa	If you continue to ignore her antics eventually she'll get bored and find something else to cause too much drama over. You're doing the right thing.|`|S1O0bDesaa	Kiss her passionately, then eat her out...|`|AA10778911	dump her|`|d7ISUrkYaa	if everyone is believing the stuff that she is making up, then you should confront her and tell her just because she's mad that you guys aren't friends doesn't mean she has to be immature & start crap.    but if no one believes her, then just blow it off and let her go make a fool of herself, haha|`|Ic2CzEojaa	Okay i cant tell u wat  2 do but i can tell u wat not 2 do. DONT BECOME HER FRIEND AGAIN!!!thatz exactly wat she wants u 2 do and she iz expecting u 2 come bak crawling 2 her dont let her control u. if u become her friend now everyone will think ur a jerk b/c u jus became her friend again cuz u didnt want her telling everyone wat happend so either way u loose. Jus tell every1 itz not true and the real story. Hope this helps |`|UtwMxaPzaa	Nope. I think you're right. you did what you could, and you made your choice. Move on, ignore her, and good for you.
aIEkNM0Paa	just tell him you're sorry for what ever you did and i think its a perfect time to tell him that you like him and explain the way you're acting.. good luck i hope he likes you too :D|`|86Pd2qxLaa	if you like him like you say you do don't email or myspace or hi5 him talk to him in person and ask him why he's mad at you when you get it all settled tell him you like him ..........if it goes well tell me the details in email.
0fVtHNtmaa	He's a total loser. Find a guy that can support himself and that stays out of jail.
08RHxGGFaa	Well, on a lighter note, this sounds almost identical to the plot of the show Fresh Prince!<br>  <br>  But down to business, maybe try to talk to her and tell her that you won't let it happen again. Tell her that you were in the wrong to have messed with them in the first place, and if you see that they will be a harm to you or your friends, then you will definitely consider the move.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
GGSSxFsUaa	Nothing has changed for you! You can't speak for your husbands emotional state or what is going on in his mind and body. Talk to him as honest and open as possible.<br>  <br>  If he isn't having orgasms I would say it's medical condition or you just don't do it for him anymore. Sorry, but it's either one or the other.|`|kbz5S3waaa	get back on Birth Control... it might be eating at him inside, he may not be ready for a baby.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Some medications will do this.  Some anti-depression medication can keep a man from getting off.  Is he on any meds that you know of.  If he is, do some research on it.<br>  <br>  Another thing, is, if hes getting it too much or too often, a guy gets "used to it"  and its like the same ole same ole.  Take a few week break and try it again.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Is he taking any type of medicine? Antidepressants can cause this. Can he masturbate to orgasm? If yes, it's probably psychological.|`|AA11348136	Maybe he has erectile dysfunction|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Let him take the matter in his own hands.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	The best thing you can do is act like nothing is wrong and keep humping him.  Anxiety on his end is bad enough, without throwing yours on top of it. It's possible he is anxious about getting you pregnant. <br>  <br>  If the problem persists, he should talk to his doctor.  Either that, or he is orgasming elsewhere (with his hands, for instance).|`|tX2giFynaa	This is a very serious problem, but do not worry. There is a best solution for this problem.<br>  Read the following link carefully.<br>  <a href="http://www.health.com/health/condition-article/0,,20190122,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.health.com/health/condition-a...</a><br>  <br>  I hop that you will get your happy marriage/sex life very soon.<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS YOU|`|AA11349925	He is subconsciously doubting the decision to get you pregnant which can cause him to mentally block the sexual sensation. Go back on birth control for a while and see how it goes.|`|ppF6oSCQaa	Decrease the amount of sex you're having.  Try once a week and let him initiate it.|`|dprURFLxaa	He does not want to pollinate your flower. ★|`|88bDvyiwaa	try to masturbate him.|`|kej0H1AXaa	you must be a boring lay|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Maybe he doesn't really want a baby and doesn't know how to tell you or why. Maybe it WAS something he wanted but now he doesn't... Your username out here is "hoping for a miracle baby 2009" so it seems plausible that you really want this to happen...   It seems really interesting that you want a baby and now he cannot orgasm.  Maybe he thought he was ready for a baby but he's not and he has anxiety that is preventing him from reaching orgasm.  After all, his ejaculation means a baby that he may not want right now.<br>  I'll bet you that if you just go back on birth controls or use condoms, he'd be able to enjoy sex and orgasm again without worry of pregnancy.  If so, there's your answer.<br>  If not, perhaps it's stress from work or maybe he's on medication that disrupts his sexual function. I mean, I'd have to have you complete a questionaire to try to pinpoint what the problem is.  I cannot say that he just doesn't want kids.  You might try cutting back on how many times a week you have sex.  I don't know his age or what medications he might be taking or what kind of stress he has in his life.   He may have some kind of sexual problem with ejaculation.  The truth is, we'd all need to know more about him to really give an educated response to this, and it would be pretty personal to give us everything on him but blood and urine here.|`|3607b56f2bf23c8bf13c28d67a71c6f5aa	Possibly he doesn't want to orgasm?  If you're trying to have a baby perhaps he's not ready, maybe has a girlfrfiend.  If known of the above try anal.|`|dKyi5MLKaa	try toys<br>  creams<br>  striptease<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226090202AAb2uS3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|6zCalKvKaa	He might have AIDS or a tapeworm.|`|8os6wuQLaa	I think he needs to be evaluated by a doctor. This is not normal|`|c6tiEmB6aa	its because you're not tight enought.|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Even though you've stopped trying to get pregnant, is the idea of wanting a baby stressing him out in any fashion?  Men love to provide and when they feel like they're not providing for the women they love (whether it's food, shelter, sexual pleasure, or children), it totally impairs their libido.  <br>  <br>  How long is your foreplay?  Are you taking time to kiss, massage, stroke, talk to each other?  It's so important to make sex magical which includes having a real connection and setting the mood.  <br>  <br>  Without knowing the full situation, I'd say it still has to do with TTCing.  Even though you've stopped, the pressure is still there and the loss of not being pregnant yet is still there.  Be sure you reassure him that he's doing everything he can in that department, that it'll happen when it's supposed to and don't complain at all or lament over not being pregnant.  That will keep him worried about it.|`|ad2f9df6e51923e9b041c490b085104eaa	Honey, sounds to me like your man is going through some emotional crap. Is he really ready to be dad? Not to be rude, but a lot of women don't really care about the man's feeling on the issue. You need to have a heart to heart with your guy and just listen. DO not interrupt him, and do not get all girly emotional. Ask him if he is ready and willing to take on such a huge responsibility and commitment.  If it turns out that he isn't, then you should seriously reconsider.
gzaVGE4Qaa	If you're going out with Laura doesn't that mean you have a girlfriend?
AA11101968	I think you should worry about getting back together first before you ask him to marry you.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if he was in an accident and not allowed to have visitors, odds are he is still in bad shape, and on pain meds and wouldnt remember you asking him in the first place.<br>  <br>  as hard as it might be, wait till he is out of the hospital, THEN sort this out.  just because you think you will get back together doesnt mean that he does.  for all you know he might take this car accident as a sign that life is short and he needs to move to india and help poor kids.  wait till he gets a chance to sort his own life out after this<br>  <br>  like, please dont think im being an insensitive ***** here, but honestly, if he was in a car accident, his first concern is going to be getting well enough to function, then he is probably going to have a ton of other stuff he needs to sort out as far as doctor bill and whatever is left of his car and stuff like that.  injecting a marraige proposal into his life is just going to complicate things.  let him sort his life at his own pace honey.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	wait until he is allowed vistors and just ask him. Tell him you have had time to think and you can't live without him.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Maybe the car accident was a sign of fate that his life is going to be a wreck without you.  You should bring that up in conversation.  <br>  <br>  If you're not allowed to visit him, you can write him a letter and bring it into the hospital.  The nurses can give it to him or read it to him, etc.  You can drop off food or flowers.  I'm sure as he starts recovering you will be able to visit him.  But I would go with a romantic letter to get the ball rolling.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Remember, the two of you are no longer together. You need to accept that fact and stop being in denial. When he is able to receive visitors and is willing to see you you should pay him a visit. Greet him as a friend and let him know that you still care about him. However, recuperating in the hospital is neither the time nor the place for  a marriage proposal. Let him recover before trying to get back with him. If he agrees then work on the relationship and take it from there.|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	get on your knees and beg|`|GfPclAo0aa	Meet him as soon as he is allowed to see his visitors. If he seems mad and upset then steer clear for a while. If he seems kind of happy that you decided to visit him talk to him like a friend not boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. If the break up was your idea also tell him you feel guilty and stupid about the whole thing.Don't mention you want to marry him yet since you just broke up with him but i guess if he seems happy you can tell him you love him.|`|QvdlLBNCaa	I think you should tell him first that you regret breaking up with him in the first place and you want to be with him but I think you should give it a little time before you ask him to marry you.  :)|`|0GcJezYyaa	I really cant live without you?<br>  <br>  please be my husband<br>  <br>  come home to me a night<br>  <br>  let me work with you to get you better<br>  <br>  i love you

FjDzAtLPaa	She has no sense of humour Lmao.<br>  I think you should apoligse directly to her bf, so she recognizes your maturity about being mates again. <br>  gOod luck :-)|`|991d9dbadb757302092acf58552d5e65aa	ok I am surprised she still talked to you after the first time.  I am also surprised her bf didn't harm you!  Anyways I think what you should do is offer a heartfelt honest apology and then stop screwing around, and acting like a jerk. Otherwise eventually she'll stop talking to you for good, and then where are you at?|`|lzJCGcQbaa	Honestly, no.<br>  never try the same approach twice.<br>  im a woman, i should know this.<br>  The flowers were nice the 1st time, but now u haveto make up for your mistake by NOT ******* up again. and u pretty much have to come from your heart. if u cant stop making her mad, maybe she's not for u.<br>  or the other way around.
2IucAWrQaa	Yup, it is.    If I were in the position, i'd kick his a** to be honest lol.|`|SPAZHdXWaa	yes|`|WMiv4xeLaa	yes|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Yes.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	because the jails would be full if it were illegal. its legal according to the laws, but its not according to god's laws.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	What do you mean by legal?  As far as getting a ticket for cheating, then in that aspect you could assume it is legal.  So until that time that we have marriage police, I guess your safe.  But is it right, no.  Cheating is breaking the vows of the marriage, you may not get a ticket, but you may be paying for your cheating ways, either financially or in the afterlife.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	It depends on the culture.  In some cultures, it is NOT legal to have extramarital affairs and the cheater will be punished or even executed.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Fornication happens.

I think that infidelity could be viewed as a breech of a marriage contract, and therefore not legal, but grounds for divorce, a civil law, a broken contract, with legal remedies available should the wronged spouse wish to pursue legal 'remedy'.|`|djUMvICoaa	If it was illegal, how would the law be enforced.  You have to have evidence to convict someone.  Who's going to tell?  Another reason one isn't passed is have you listened to how many of our lawmakers have been having affairs?  You don't think they want to ruin a good thing do you?  It being immoral should be enough for the people.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Why are Big Macs legal?<br>  Why are Twinkies legal?<br>  Why is booze legal?<br>  Why are cigarettes legal?<br>  For goodness sakes why are the Jonas Brothers legal?<br>  <br>  We live in America, the land of the free. All of these things that are bad for you are legal. You get to make choices.|`|uDkXHaa6aa	because it's a moral issue not a legal issue.|`|ppF6oSCQaa	It's not legal to cheat on your spouse in some state, for instance it's illegal in the state of Michigan.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	You can't legislate morality.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Well go to Iran, There it's illegal.

Iam sure some where there is a law against it. but its like to old of law if you look around you can find some old laws that would blow your mind.that no one uses anymore .<br>  i seen one that it is illegal for a woman to ride in the car next to her husband she is to walk outside the car beside him .just try telling my wife that .|`|RBRq8406aa	Ok look at it from other direction why should it be illegal? Also what do you want the police to do arrest people our jails are full enough and now want to add too it? Not that say cheating is great just think about what your asking.
jwIdq5qkaa	When I was dating my husband, I got busy. I had started a job to help save money for the wedding and was still trying to go to school. Then dropped both of them for a higher paying job and online school. There were times I didn't pay attention to him and didn't even realize it till he brought it to my attention! I felt horrible about it and put him first not the high paying job or my education. Maybe she just doesn't realize it yet.

Try to get the truth from her. If she wants to separate, that's ok, and if not, then maybe you should stop worrying so much, because that will lead to mistrust, jealousy, and so on.

She might be having second thoughts or might have been hurt in the past and scared if she gets to close that she will get hurt again. I would ask her if there was anything wrong between you and see if you could work through it cause you miss the closeness between you and her. See if she will meet you for dinner or a movie and talk things out. Hope I could help. Been there quite a few times.

Stop flirting with everybody!|`|gCR2DaJzaa	If you love her than prove to her that she can trust you and that you will never hurt her.|`|7evhfqQsaa	NO she doesnt like you cause your a sad sad individual....  its not that she doesnt like you because your a 'player' she doesnt like you because you THINK your a 'player'...    get a hold of yourself you twat!|`|IGpCFPWsaa	Actions speak louder  than words so the best way to  demonstrate you love her  is to just show her.|`|h06mx3d8aa	no, i don't think she likes u. & show or tell her u like her honestly.|`|JNUWzHGzaa	you need to prove to her that your not a player because its the biggest turn off to a girl! dont flirt with girls around her, flirt with her! Hug her when shes just walking or somthing, or wen u walk by her show her ur noticin her by like pushing and and winking or ruffling her hair up! Then maybe just tell her? BUT FIRST you need to prove your not a player if your not x|`|f5a4fe2b807592bfe565a15dd455d134aa	flirting with other girls isnt going to help..you need to pay attention to her be a gentlemen and you need to confess all of those feelings you have for her to her|`|YGZuAl2Caa	Shower her with attention. Don't flirt with other girls. Smile, try to touch her shoulder, or maybe preted hit her, just for fun. Be her best friend, then move on to something more.
hHnNprYLaa	hes a keeper|`|RdvL6CGmaa	I don't think I would be able to take that... seems a little odd and a weird thing to think of... I would be mentally horrified for the rest of my life!|`|EYPuklEfaa	implant an extra vagina|`|0fae7d421461e0079bc59a49dbe27030aa	Use both hands would help|`|iEvlbsXDaa	Well thats strange...|`|c6tiEmB6aa	i think you should stuff yourself in both places|`|6Nv8unWraa	Consider yourself the luckiest girl on the planet.
waY5APFkaa	There isn't anything wrong with it- as long as you leave the details about your ex out of conversation. I wouldn't tell your current girl that you used to take your ex girl to the same place- that would be tacky.|`|7w2kCTDJaa	I don't see the big deal. I mean, don't announce that you used to come here with so & so. No need to say anything about it at all. It's not as if it was a special place for you & your ex.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Of course. Just don't mention the ex at all.|`|sg2hOcXLaa	I truly think that you should try a new place with her. Nothings wrong with having a new favorite place with someone new. <br>  Sometimes sharing old memories in new relationships can lead to problems. So be sure to experience as much as you can with her so that you can have new memories to keep with you in your heart concerning her.|`|XLjSYo67aa	something new is always good but if you took your ex there no biggie just doing bring it up in the convo that "me and my ex have been here a couple of times"! lol it doesnt matter, i have went to places with guy friends of mine and boyfriends of mine with other boy friends and such lol! its perfectly fine!|`|SmFVG8eXaa	I don't see a problem with it. Imagine if you couldn't take your new gf anywhere where you took your ex - wouldn't be a lot of places left.  Plus, it doesn't sound like it was a fond memory of your old relationship, so I say go for it.
CEXgGQUvaa	Alcohol and the children dont mixing.  Leave this loser for safety.  Enough was when he first start to drink.|`|AA11603468	Enough is enough when you decide it is. If you don't want to divorce, I would tell him you are considering a separation, as you simply cannot live that way anymore. It's worn you down. His promises mean nothing-he's an addict and truly he isn't in his right mind. He can make promises, but lacks the ability to translate those promises into behaviors that are acceptable to you. He probably needs rehab and also probably needs to go to AA. Once his head is clear, you can talk about getting your family back together, but really, he's coasting because nothing in his life has gone really wrong as a result of his drinking.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	if it's 'hard for you and the children' then it's not a 'functional' relationship.  tell him to get some help one more time and you'll support him as best you can.  if he doesnt follow through, well then, get your kids out of the situation.  <br>  <br>  sometimes, a woman finds the right genetic partner for her kids but he proves not to be a worthy father/spouse.  move on if you must.|`|zprAkP3eaa	It's alright to want to leave him, he needs to cut back, that's not hate way to live. He wont change unless something big in his life makes he want to stop. For ex: My cousin was a big drinker, drunk everyday and all day, not to long ago he found out he had something wrong with him and if he kept drinking then he would die, he has been sober for months and months now. He groped it cold turkey.|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	huh???|`|4EWCegiRaa	So he's an alcoholic AND he lies to you...Relationships go both ways and if he's not even trying, you have every right to say enough is enough.  Actually, you should have said it already.<br>  <br>  Here's what I'd do so I could try to help and move on with a clean conscience if necessary.  Sit him down and tell him you're giving him one more chance. Tell him you know it won't be hard but if he lies about, hides it, or stops trying, you're out.<br>  <br>  Try your best to help him but if he doesn't make any progress, leave him.  <br>  <br>  As for "stick through like a good partner", you're only ENABLING him if you stay.  What about him being a good partner?  Don't ever forget that relationships go both ways.|`|wb781QEzaa	I agree with most of the answers below. It is not good for the kids and no you shouldnt feel bad for wanting to leave and sometimes that is the best medicine for someone who drinks alot is to see if they dont quit that they will end up losing everything in their life and sometimes it will wake them up unless he is abusive when he drinks. If he has close friends and family that also notice the behavior see if they will help you get him help for the sake of your family that yall have made.|`|LJuMOlPPaa	If his addiction could have serious damaging effects on you and the family and it seems to be getting worse gather family and have an intervention. Some addicts will put they addiction over everything until they they hit rock bottom. Giving ultimatums gives them a chance climb back up before they reach that bottom. when make your decision think long and hard about you and your family and the future.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	Baby, you'll know when enough is enough!<br>  No one can tell you when to leave! I know it might not seem like I'm helping you in any way, but its turn!<br>  As far for the kids, never stay with someone that you know you're just there for the kids!<br>  You'll be living one big lie!!<br>  What will happen when they're grow and have moved out, then what?<br>  Do whats best for you and your kids!!!<br>  Pray about it, and God will show you exactly what to do!!!|`|AA10958492	I would suggest giving him an ultimatum- its me and the kids or the booze. This is just the tip of the iceberg, more alcohol and problems will come. I suggest you talk to him soon and tell him what you are going to do. No tears, just the truth. You seem like a strong woman. Do what you need to do to make your life the best it can be with your children. Best of luck to you!|`|xF6e9LcJaa	it's ok to leave him.|`|tGEMwgyBaa	Here's the thing,...he is an alcoholic, functional or not. Do you want to wait until he is dis-functional to leave? By that time he may do more damage to you and your children. He will not stop until he has hit bottom and he will not see that he is taking you and your kids down with him. I don't think you would want to send out the message to your kids that this is o.k. and acceptable behavior. Let him know that you are not keeping the kids from him and he can see them when he is sober. If he continues to drink then he is making the choice not to see them. Maybe this will be what he needs to see that he needs to clean up and sober up for himself and his children. Good Luck, I hope everything works out for you and your family.
znr8ep4eaa	w8 to see what it is  it might be nothing  don't freak out  and if it turns out to be cancer, then remember that it doesn't have to kill her. people survive from cancer every day  and try to appreciate what you have with her|`|AA11684065	Try to make your mom's last days pleasant ones! & then pray for her soul when the time comes.|`|AA10531094	Try to stay calm and don't get upset.  A lump can be serious or something simple as a cyst or your mom could have lumpy breasts especially around her period.  I'm sure they'll biopsy the lump for cancer.  Keep your fingers crossed and pray.  Good Luck!|`|1i5HSIbkaa	i would spend as much time as possible with her for now and see how everything turns out. good luck|`|q0b6uPCraa	Stay calm and dont be upset. It will worry her more. Pray for her and spend everyday with her. Bring her favourite things and be curious and ask the doctors what are the possible drugs. Then search up a brest cancer website and see the cures on there.    Good luck!    I hope she doesn't pass away. Tell us if she does. God bless.|`|966e591e0a8b096ea3291985162ce64eaa	Unfortunately there is nothing you can do but wait and see. From what I have read most lumps are not cancerous. I just found a lump and I have an appointment with the doctor Monday. I have been reading as much as I can on the internet, and that has made me feel a little better.Keep in mind that your mom is probably very worried and try to be strong for her.|`|3MGsq3a0aa	well spend alot of time with her keep tellin her how much you love her cuz u will miss her so much when shes gone i lost my mother to cancer its something scarey that you cant do anything about but get all the memories in and dont let it get her or you down
