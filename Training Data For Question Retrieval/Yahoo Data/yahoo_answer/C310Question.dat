I believe your sun definetly has a lot to do with it, as I've noticed patterns; however, I believe there must be another part of your chart that plays into this, due to variations I have noticed in people.  I also would think ascendant and aspects.      And, specifically what sign/aspect would make a person go for the Bohemain/Artsy look?  I am thinking Neptune aspecting ascendant.  I also think Scorpio suns, Pisces suns and Aquarius suns (females), but with Neptune aspects.

I was watching this horror movie about 2 weeks ago on t.v. the setting and picture look like its recent. Anyways I caught the tale end of it and forgot what the title was. I just remember some professor i think, and he won't let the girl out of the place. then im not sure if its jason or who but this guy in a mask comes out and he looks like a teen and they show his story real quick, i guess he had a bad childhood. then he puts the mask back on apparently and kills the professor. the girl goes and ends up killing him presumably. the cops come and it shows that she though she killed the guy but it ended up being some girl. she then repeatedly says "he's still here!" and i guess they arrest her.then the movie ends.   its not scary movie or scream if that helps. anyways thanks.

20090307151558AAE8Z19	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Where's the love for Anette Olzon? You know, that singer chick from that one band?	Everyone knows her now as the "new singer for Nightwish". At best, she is only "good" to some people. At worst, she's a terrible excuse for a human being because she has a different style than Tarja did and the band dared to accept her as their vocalist. Well, I quite like her. Nothing is going to bring Tarja back so we might as well get used to Anette. And if you can't, then don't listen. :)      I did a little bit of research about some other things Anette has provided vocals for and here's some of what I came up with. What do you think? Did I miss anything obvious?      Pain - "Follow Me" (2008)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRbv4O65v...       Pain - "Feed Us" (2008)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV6tQgYtL...

I'm trying to find the episode of Family Guy where Stewie and Brian are eating at a restaurant/diner and a hooker/prostitute walks in and her and stewie make eye contact and Stewie calls out threateningly where his money is. And the hooker runs out the door.      What episode is this in? I've only seen it once. And No I'm not referring to the time Stewie beats Brian, its easy to find those clips on youtube.

20090307154215AArqHnN	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Which show is more 'sacrilicious'- The Simpsons, or South Park?	I love both shows, although there are some very controversial topics and episodes.       My wife thinks that the Simpsons is more sacrilegious than South Park. I suspect that Matt Groening may have some prejudices against Christians and Christianity, but I could be wrong. I have been wrong many times before.       I say that South Park is more offensive (to some people) and sacrilegious. I would feel comfortable asserting this because the show tries to push things to the extreme limits, and it does it very well! But I also happen to like the show, and I think it's quite funny, the fact that I am a born again Christian notwithstanding. I am more open minded than some conservatives, but not so open minded that I would compromise my core beliefs. I am not offended that easily- well, it really depends on what the nature of the offense is. I can't honestly say that I always respond the way that a Christian should when people try to "rile me up." I am very hypersensitive, but not easily offended. Is this a contradiction?      I am an advocate of free speech, and so I would never want the plug to be pulled on any of those shows. To me, it's not so important what people say as what they do in life. Do you agree?      What is your opinion on these matters?

20090307154939AApiN8k	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: What is Love??? Im 17, and i'd like to know what love is. as stupid as it sounds?	As stupid as my question sounds, “what is love?” Its true. What is love? People claim they know what love is. Or they say “love is” and then they pull up some quote by some person that I don’t know. And there like “that’s love” love is something that one person claims they know? I thought no one knows that love is because of how beautiful and special it is. How can you say “love is… a feeling you have of a person” or “love is.. when you first wake up in the morning and the first thing you think about when you frist open your eyes is them. Its someone you can never stop thinking of…. Then your in love” I thought lust is also like that in some ways!! Am I not wrong?!      Well I have a Question!! What is love? Like a movie? But even in movies throw, that not love. Is it? cuz really the actors playing the people there not in love usually. So wouldn’t that be lust as well right! Songs? No songs have nothing to do with love either right? because most people that write about being in love later one break up like the song “love story” by Taylor Swift that was written for one of the Jonas brothers that she was dating. And they later on broke up. So what is love? Its not a movie, show, book, play, song, quote. What is it? don’t tell me its something as stupid as something from a movie, like “when you look into the person eyes the frist time you just know” don’t give me that ****. That’s not love that can be lust like every other feeling. WHAT IS LOVE?! Can words really say what love is? Or is it just a personally feeling no one knows, until you fall in love? Its not something someone can judge is it? ANYWAYS what love???      ~*~*~ P.S. sorry for the typo’s… ~*~*~

It's a documentary of the daughter who grows up in Tennessee I believe and she has a pretty heavy southern accent.

Which had people living there as well. In this Village there was a garden with flower that grew and were well taken care of. The owner of the garden was a witch and guarded her garden. Also in this village there was a young couple with two children and a husband and a wife. It was soon to be the husbands birthday and the wife had nothing to give. She would always pass the garden looking at the flower and thought how great of a gift it would be to give her husband one. So anyways she goes and grabs a flower from the garden. As she leaves the garden the witch appears before her. She yells at her and does her thing and says she is punished and vanished her no more. Many hours later her husband is very worried about his wife. The witch appeared before him and told what his wife has done. He cried and cried and told her he would do anything to get his wife back. The witch said to him. "There are three new rose bushes in my garden, you wife is one of them. you have until 3 days to pick a rose from garden and figure which one is which, if you pick the wrong one you and you family will be part of my garden forever." The witch did also did say that from dark to dusk his wife would be there, so when the sun was about to set she would vanish to one of the three rose bushes.After the three days of pain and sorrow. He went to the garden right as the sun was coming up. He headed straight for the rose bushes and started for a moment. He then grabbed for one of the branches and took a rose from a bush. Just then his wife appeared and everything was happy except for the witch. Here comes the riddle part, how did he know what rose bush to pick from?

One afternoon a man came home from work to find total disorder in his house. His three children were outside, still in their P.J.'s, playing in the mud, with empty food boxes and wrappers thrown all about the front yard. The door to his wife's car was open, as was the front door to the house. Proceeding into the entry, he found an even bigger mess.   A lamp had been knocked over, and a throw rug was wadded against one wall. In the front room the TV was blaring a cartoon channel, and the family room was strewn with toys and various items of clothing. In the kitchen, dishes filled the sink, breakfast food was spilled on the counter, dog food was spilled on the floor, a broken glass lay under the table and a small pile of sand lay piled up by the back door.   He quickly headed up the stairs, stepping over toys and other piles of clothes, looking for his wife. He was worried that she might be ill, or worse!.   He found her lounging in the bedroom, still in her pajamas, reading a novel.   She smiled, looked up at him and asked how his day went. He looked at her bewildered and asked, "What happened here today?"   She again smiled and answered, "you know everyday when you come home from work and ask me what in the world did I do today?"   "Yes", he replied reluctantly.   She answered, "We'll, today I didn't do it!".

20090307130544AAXEvJi	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Please checkout my new poem I wrote about zodiac sign "Virgo"?	Shy, reserved, I love to be neat,   Sensitive I am, and I have a perfect memory.   For I am the “Analyzer” I love details,   I could stick to any budget but I hate to fail.   If you ask me my opinion I’ll give you the facts,   I attract many admirers, and I easily adapt to any situation.   For perfection is my middle name no doubt about it,   Though I could mingle with a crowd I’d prefer to be more one on one in an intimate setting.  A mutable sign I do like to share,   Very alert to my surroundings, and devoted to the ones I care for.   Smooth, and laidback as the sound of the ocean’s shore,                  Pure the symbol “The Virgin” Virgo.

20090307130143AAQYjV8	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why do loyal Saggitarians get screwed over?	I'm a Sag girl and I'm very loyal to my few close friends and family. I'm also the oldest and it's natural for me to want to take care of those around me. I'm not overbearing but I'll do little things to express I care, that I'm there anytime. On Valentine's day (instead of mopping I didn't have a boyfriend), I gave single stem roses to 3 of my best girl friends w. a cute quote fr. our show "sex and the city".       Lately, I feel that whenever I really need someone - advice or emotional support, my friends aren't really "there" for me as much as I am for them. I feel alone and me asking for advice seems so selfish. I'm very independent minded and I'm not clingy yet they sense something and run off and I'm left alone.       - my male libra friend (who's ex girlfriend is one of my close girl friends - a leo) has been my closest friend recently. He's very very hurt and all he does is mope but I'm still there for him. It's really platonic and i would never go for him so it's easy for me to be cool w. him. On vday, i bought him a "chicken soup for the soul" book to cheer him up. Now I'm in the most stressful situation: I got into a bad accident (rear ended) my back/neck suffered a little more than whiplash and the guy who hit me is trying to "compromise" than call insurance. I'm frustrated over my major b/c I might not get in, and i'm healing from all the love situations and guys i've encountered the past few months. Work (and the economy as you know), has been stressin me out.       Now when I really need a close friend, my male libra friend cops out on me and I feel hurt. His ex-girlfriend (who he's been crying about - leo), hasn't been talking to me (not bc of her ex, she's aware he always txts me and she's fine) but it's like she disappeared. My cousin (who lives in hawaii also a leo) - haven't spoken to her in ages and she never responds to my text when i ask how she is. My virgo friend (younger) also never reponds back....she's only there when she needs someting..      sorry i'm being a baby but i feel like my loyalty has done nothing for me.

20090307131949AAqpKQR	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Is Pisces a powerful sign (Feb19-Mar20)?	I dont mention Jesus Christ because his method to save the world is too old with a lot of mistakes, I think L Ron Hubbard′s method is so much much better. Maybe Scientology is not the true religion but is the best.       - Karl Adolf Eichmann (born March 19) Directly responsible for the final solution of the Jewish question ¨Holocaust¨.      - Albert Einstein (born March 14) You and I are solar powered, at least indirectly. It is the Sun's energy that grows plants that (one way or another) we eat and get our energy from. Until Einstein derived E = mc2 from his special theory of relativity it was a complete mystery as to what the fuel source of the Sun was.      - Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (born March 13) American science fiction writer who devised a self-help system called Dianetics, first published in 1950, which he developed over the next three decades into a set of doctrines and rituals he called Scientology.      Kim Ung-Yong (born March 7) listed in the Guinness Book of World Records under "Highest IQ"; the book estimated the boy's score at over 210.      -Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni[1] (born March 6) often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Italian Leonardo da Vinci.      Pisces: Astrologers who speak of an old soul refer to a soul which has gone through many lives, retaining the wisdom of each. Often they refer to Pisces, because a life as the fish is either the most difficult obligation a soul can choose _or a chance to reach perfect fulfillment. While Aries represents birth in the zodiac, Pisces represents death and eternity. The fish is the twelfth sign, a composite of all that's gone before, and his nature is a blend of all the other signs, which is quite a lot to cope with. His surprising ability to organize and concentrate on detail which pops up now and then, as well as his gentleness, reflects his inner knowledge of the lessons of Virgo. His judgment is as fair and detached as that of Libra, and his love of pleasure is also purely Libran. Pisces people have the crazy sense of fun of Cancer, as well as both the Cancerian sympathy and crabbiness. They're sometimes full of the Sagittarian outspoken frankness and generosity, as fun-loving and outgoing as Leo, yet as devoted to duty as Capricorn, and often just as envious of social distinction. There may also be a smattering of the Saturnine melan-choly. Perhaps more than just a smattering. The fish can be as moody as a Moon child and as happy as a lion. He likes to tease and analyze in Aquarian fashion. He's often overflowing with Aries idealism and enthusiasm, but usually without the Mars drive. A Pisces person can zip around with Gemini quickness, talk just as fast and think just as cleverly. He can also be as lazy and peaceful as Taurus. He has the clever wit of Mercury and the soft grace of Venus, and he combines it with the mystic penetration of Scorpio, without the Scorpio's ruthlessness.

During one of her daily classes a teacher trying to teach good manners, asked her students the following question: "Michael, if you were on a date having dinner with a nice young lady, how would you tell her that you have to go to the bathroom?" Michael said, "Just a minute I have to go pee." The teacher responded by saying, "That would be rude and impolite.    What about you Peter, how would you say it?" Peter said, "I am sorry, but I really need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back." "That's better, but it's still not very nice to say the word bathroom at the dinner table.       And you, little Johnny, can you use your brain for once and show Us your good manners?" I would say: "Darling, may I please be excused for a moment? I have to shake hands with a very dear friend of mine, whom I hope you'll get to meet after dinner."

However, most of the jokes I have told my whole life, have been old jokes from books and the internet, etc. I took a comedy class several years ago and had to write and perform my own routine in a comedy club for the exam. I did reasonably good on it. However, I only got a C in the class.   It was so hard to write my own jokes, I worked on my routine for over a month to get it good! It still wasn't perfect, because I was an armature.   What are some good ways other people write their own jokes?   I need all the help I can get here. I am not planning on getting on stage again any time soon. But I want to at least write some good jokes to entertain my friends with.   Also, if I get a good routine written for myself, I can go perform on stage very easily, because I live in Orlando, FL. Maybe I can even perform at Disney World!

With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)      2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)      3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it?       4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?      5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?

Well the same would go "Blame it on the A-a-a-alchol(Crowd yells Alkaholiks!)Blame it on the A-a-a-a-Alcohol(Crowd once again yells Alkaholiks!) Sounds like a good idea doesn't it? Of course they'd have to get sample permission from Jamie Foxx before they get sued out the butt. LOL Anyway, sound good don't it? If anybody related with the Alkholiks is in the future reading this, let this be one of your sample ideas if you guys decide to drop another album, this sounds like a great idea boys.

The 90's saw the rise of electronica/techno/rave, pretty mainstream these days, the 2000's (in my opinion) saw rap/hip-hop dominate album sales (can't deny this) which is extremely popular now (its everywhere, ESPN, Fox, CNN, pretty much every night club, etc.)...so I was wondering - what music will command the next decade?? It will be very interesting since downloading-internet piracy has hurt the music industry and changed it forever.

After a few seconds it became apparent that she was in real distress, and two locals, Bluey and Bazza sitting at the next table turned to look at her.      Ken ya swaller? asked Bluey      The woman signalled 'No!', desperately shaking her head.      Kin ya breathe?' asked Bazza. The woman shook her head No!!!      With that, Bluey walked behind her, lifted up the back of her dress, yanked down her knickers and ran his tongue up and down the crack of her butt.      This shocked the woman into such a violent spasm that the obstruction flew out of her mouth and she began to breathe again.      Bluey swaggered back to his table and took a deep swig of his beer.      Bazza said in admiration 'Ya know Bluey, I'd heard of that bloody Hind Lick Manoeuvre, but that's the first time I ever seen   somebody do it.

20090307152344AAEHnEp	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The ending of Watchmen *spoiler alert*?	I just came back from Watchmen, and from what I saw, I loved the movie, but there was a HUGE problem with the projection.      About 30 minutes before the movie ended, the sound speakers blew out and all the actor's voices became muffled, as if they were talking with their hands cupped over their faces.      CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW WATCHMEN ENDS??      Last I left off, I saw that Dr. Manhattan was coming back to Earth to save the East Coast from nuclear bombs.  Rorschach and Nite Owl had just found out that the person behind the whole scheme was Ozymandias.      Easy 10 points for person with the best answer.  Please and thank you to everyone!   P.S. I got compensation via free passes to another showing, but I don't think I have another two and a half hours to blow this weekend.
20090307134739AAJWN7X	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Watchmen Comicbook Movie Survey: Penises in Movies - For or Against?	- For. There aren't enough male members in movies today. It's discrimination I tell ya!   - Against. They're ugly, shriveled little things. Yuck.   - Who cares? You see one tallywhacker, you've seen them all.      The original survey is here.   http://www. comicbookmovie.com/watchmen/news/?a=5077      The whole situation makes me giggle. Not the tallywhacker itself, but response of the general public. I mean, you see breasts in movies all the time.
20090307140047AAgP5fQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	How is it that a song written in major and minor can sound different?	I understand that a major scale will sound different than a minor scale.    The relative of C Major is A minor. Neither have any flats or sharps.    So, if a composer writes a song in the key of C Major, it will generally (I know this is  not always the case) have an upbeat sound. But if he/she chose to write the song in A minor, it would most likely have a more mysterious, ominous, or sad feeling. Both songs have the same key signature, all the same notes are used, but how in the world can both of them sound different?      Also, my piano teacher says that a major scale sounds different than a minor scale because of "the intervals between the notes" I don't understand that. Then I looked it up myself and a website said it is the tonal center (also called the tonic) that defines the sound of a major or minor scale. And I guess the tonal center is the the note that the whole scale is centered upon, or circles around. I don't get it, honestly. Explain it.

Its so much fun to dance to!   of course he can be a bit like gross in an immature way, if you watch his videos, but I read his blogs on myspace and a lot of what he says is true! he was talking about abuse to women and stuff. He may be a bit bizarre but he can be pretty smart believe it or not. His videos are pretty funny also, but if you hate gays than I'd rather you not answer this question please. Who gave YOU the right to tell THEM wether they can get married or not? And don't say god. I believe that god and jesus love gays as much as they do straight people. Can love be a sin? No.

My friends and I were going out to dinner and this disgusting old white man he must have been at least in his late 40's or 50's kept staring at every girl that walked by and his wife didn't even notice. She was innocently talking to him and he was responding while staring at girls half his age. What a pig. I am Muslim so I was covered up even when he was trying to smile at me I ignored him...but my friend was wearing a short black dress with her back turned against him-shes blonde- and he kept staring at her rear end. We finally went up to him and told him to start looking at his wife and not as girls his daughters age. His wife slapped him after that. These men are animals, did we do something wrong?

At the end of every episode, there's the cartoon of the scene from Jaws where the old man is ribbing the chief about not going into the water in which Chief Brody replies, "That's some bad hat Harry."  And there have been a lot of one-liners during the actual show.  I just saw an episode when House discovering a problem while reviewing an x-ray film says, "Where going to need a bigger boat!"  This is a line that Chief Brody says in Jaws when they realize the size of the shark they are after. Is one of the writer's or the producer a major fan of the movie Jaws?  Has any one else noticed this? Am I crazy?  (Don't answer the last question, ha, ha, ha)

I've played a bunch of basses at local music shops and I can definitely tell the difference between cheaper ones and more expensive ones. My price range would be somewhere between $200-500.   Also, how much should I spend on an amp? I was thinking somewhere around $150-200.   I'm not sure if I'm going to play seriously with it or not but I was thinking I should at least buy something that's good enough to be played live.

(this one u probably already know) how do u drown a blonde? glue a mirror to the bottom of a pool OR put a scratch n' sniff sticker at the bottom of a pool.

20090307144520AAfNGjD	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Movie I saw as a kid, Something about a killer doll (NOT CHUCKIE!!!)?	I remember my parents told me not to watch it and to go to bed but i snuck out of my room anyways and hid behind the couch to watch the movie...worst mistake ever!!! It terrified me for the next, i don't know, year of my life.        Anyways...   There was this voodoo like doll that had an evil warrior spirit inside and people were gettin' killed and the doll was runnin' around and killin' and stuff.  The part I can remember the best is when a woman trapped it in a suitcase and it was trying to cut itself out with a knife.  She was freaking out and tried to stop the knife and got her hand all cut up.  I'm pretty sure that she finally destroyed the doll by putting it into a container of acid.  Then she was a fine little idiot and opened the container of the dissolved doll and the freed spirit posessed her.

So I just recently remembered this movie I used to watch when I was younger (this was probably mid- to late-nineties) and I was wondering if anyone could help me find it.

It was an animated movie about a girl (possibly a princess?) and I know the first scene she's sitting under a tree reading or something and her mom/nanny/someone calls her into a house (castle?)   I remember a big part of the movie revolves around some door that she wants to go inside      haha I realize that probably no one will no what I'm talking about but if anyone has a clue I'd appreciate it

My friend posted this on a myspace bulletin and I was just curious what you would do if you got a call like this.      So im at work and it's 4 pm on a Friday and some guy calls and says there are people at his home taking things out and his house is going to be foreclosed on tomorrow. People don't usually start carting things out of your house until after the foreclosure and then after an eviction process so i become immediately suspicious of his story....he's frantic and is having trouble answering my questions. I said to him, you realize you are calling at 4 pm on a Friday? And if you want us to file a bankruptcy for you to stop a foreclosure that quickly you will need to come up with $2310.00 ....i ask "Do you have $2310?" he says yes on a line of credit and i say we'll it has to be cash you cannot pay for bankruptcy on credit...DUH!       then, he says, how about crack?? will you take crack...shocked im like, what did you say? and he says, i'll give you a kilo of crack to file my bankruptcy......      OMG who effing asks an attorney office if they will take crack to do their case?      i just told him he's have to call somewhere else and hung up the phone on him.         effing crack heads

Why do people seem to think that a show that had so much success is racist? Are ALL shows, or ANY shows suppose to reflect demographics! Because if they are, then cartoons should be abolished shouldn't they? Because there are not any cartoons on the streets of Texas or California or Washington etc.       Why are people so crazy?
