NEUILLY (AFP) - Arnaud Teullé, candidat dissident aux municipales à Neuilly, a indiqué mardi avoir demandé à rencontrer son concurrent divers-droite soutenu par l'UMP, Jean-Christophe Fromantin, après des incidents entre leurs partisans dans la mairie de Neuilly dimanche soir.       M. Teullé, arrivé en deuxième position (32,12% des voix) derrière M. Fromantin (47,89%), a affirmé que certains de ses militants avaient été "agressés, tant verbalement que physiquement", lors de la soirée d'annonce des résultats en mairie dimanche soir.      Selon plusieurs témoins, des militants des deux candidats avaient alors échangé des insultes dans une ambiance de tension et de bousculade.      M. Teullé a évoqué des "verres jetés aux visages, et des agressions physiques de toutes sortes".      Source:  http://fr.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080311/tp... 
20080305065956AA96jEK	Politics & Government;Government	Pourquoi ne pas vendre ce chateau pour remplir les caisses de la France?	Domaine secondaire de l'Elysée, le chateau n'a pas re?u de ? visiteur ? depuis six mois. Un abandon qui risque de durer jusqu'à la fin du mandat de Nicolas Sarkozy.       S'IL N'AVAIT PAS bouleversé le protocole, c'est à Souzy-la-Briche que Nicolas Sarkozy aurait pu fêter son mariage en troisièmes noces avec l'Italienne Carla Bruni. Mais le président de la République a préféré conduire sa nouvelle épouse à la Lanterne. Cette résidence de Versailles, dans les Yvelines, est pourtant normalement réservée au Premier ministre.         Mais depuis son élection à l'Elysée en juin dernier, Nicolas Sarkozy a fait savoir qu'il ? troquait ? le domaine de Souzy-la-Briche contre la Lanterne. Résultat, cela fait plus de six mois que cette petite commune de 434 habitants située au coeur de l'Essonne n'a pas re?u de visite présidentielle.      ? C'est pas plus mal, lache un habitant en passant près du domaine à vélo. Notre village était transformé en bunker dès qu'un politique arrivait. On retrouve notre tranquillité. ? Une voisine avoue une petite amertume : ? Quand Nicolas Sarkozy a annoncé qu'il prenait la Lanterne au Premier ministre, on a pu lire que Fran?ois Fillon se retrouvait renvoyé dans la lointaine banlieue du c?té de Souzy. Faut pas exagérer, on n'est pas au fin fond de la Creuse. Le village est situé à moins de 50 km de Paris. ?

20081002195018AAt4pDh	Politics & Government;Military	Are air superiority fighters even needed any more?	Look at the F/22. Arguably the most advanced fighter ever created, limited in performance ONLY by the limitations of the human body.  I can't see the "next gen" of air superiority fighters even improving a little on what this fine aircraft can do.      THAT SAID, does anyone feel the days of air dogfights are over? With increasing technology in terms of ballistic missiles, satellite tracking/navigation, and other weapon systems, it seems that needing a "jet" to deliver a weapon is a bit bygone.      So if we dont need fighters to eliver tactical weapons anymore, that would leave their roles left to protecting the bombers- big vehicles that carry big bombs that cant be fit on an inter-continental missile.  But what if advanced satelite weapons and other weapon systems make huge explosions a thing of the past? Precision weapons can now enter a building through a window- no need for carpet bombing tactics.      I'm not foolish enough to think we wont need soldiers- it is the ground troops which win a war (an F/22 can't capture a building).  BUT, if we don't need airplanes for carrying bombs, protecting bombers, or deliverying speialized weapons, what's the point?

20081003090803AAN1jP7	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do all the polls say Palin won the debate?	This is an AOL poll which I'm sure is dominated by the far left and it gives Plain the win.

If Bush is so good at defending America, why is he letting a terrorist run for President? Why is the U.S. Government allowing it?      I want people to answer these questions
20081007095358AAGu95p	Politics & Government;Elections	Why wouldn't Obama stand up and tell the Ohio supporters?	that picking up homeless people and people from rehab centers is completely unethical?  They might as well just hand out 20 dollar bills for an Obama vote.  I do not understand why he would not have at least TRIED to put an end to this.  Please don't just bash Dems.  I really am curious if there is a valid reason behind him not speaking out against this.   
20081007130533AA94pmv	Politics & Government;Elections	Will Hillary supporters vote for McCain so they see her again in 2012?	Think of it this way.  If Obama wins Hillary will most likely never have chance to run for president again since he would be the incumbent in 2012.  If her supporters don't vote for McCain now she'll never be seen again. Not to mention the giant diss from Obama regarding the VP pick.

He deceives us about Ayers, his senior theisis on Russia, his college days, his ties to Wright, his ties to Louis Farrakhan.      How can you trust a man with a shady past and no experience to be President of the free world?   Isn't it time we stand up to this left wing candidate and stand behind our Constitution?

20081016110030AAONWVu	Politics & Government;Elections	McCain still has a chance...?	think so? i do. those polls are very misleading. because you have to look at the TYPE of people who partake in those polls. That type of people GENERALLY tend to be liberal. Also, do you think with the media declaring its "over" do ya think a lot of Democrats will be like "oh, Obama's got it in the bag so we dont need to go vote" just a thought... also thoses polls ALWAYS sho the Democrat in the lead. e.g. Gore, Kerry. Me thinks this is gonna be a LOT closer than a lot of people think hell, i even think McCain got a decent chance to pull off the upset.      What da ya think?
20081016120411AAXeIFU	Politics & Government;Elections	Does the election stress you out?	 No matter what you do, you can't get away from it.  No matter who you support or don't the election is shoved down your throat.  What gets me is all the people slicing each other over the internet and the arguments politics causes.  One side only knows whats best for half the country whether they want to admit it or not; Democrats and Republicans have reduced Politics in the USA to a running joke.  Does anyone else feel this way (PLEASE NO ENDORSEMENTS FOR OBAMA OR MCCAIN; I KNOW WHO I SUPPORT ALREADY!!)?

20081022084949AAsZ1C7	Politics & Government;Elections	What is more shocking in today's news?	1. Biden says we can expect to be attacked in the U.S. "mark my words we will be tested by our enemies within 6 months if obama is elected." due to obama's lack of experience in foreign affairs.      2. the obama camp responds later the same day ."joe says some crazy stuff from time to time because he has brain damage.he suffered a aneurysm years ago" . it was never treated properly. that is why he's health records have not been released.      3. CNN is cornered by Sarah Palin in yesterdays interview.and they admit they won't cover this story because it would be the end of obama.. but if they had this stuff on McCain/ Palin they admit they would make it the only thing you heard on the news till election day
20081019160547AAIYFd4	Politics & Government;Elections	Is it worth it for the Middle Class?	Think about it, if you are employed by a small business owner, and the owners tax rate is going to go up if Obama gets elected. Do you not think that your job is in jeopardy. Is the $2000.00 in tax savings worth your family's lively hood or future. That is less than $200.00 a month.    My success will not be spread around. I will be selling assets, cutting jobs and canceling contracts to stay under $250,000.00    I have also notified 25 employees that their jobs are in the balance of this election. If Obama wins then they loose, if McCain wins then we will be expanding and greater opportunities await them.    So I ask you....IS IT WORTH IT AMERICA?

A few years ago some buds and i were talking about the governor[the terminator] of california and how he cant ever be president cause he was born in austria.   I just realized that it is known that Barack Obama was not born in america, he was born in kenya.   i dont understand how he is running for president then!   he was born in kenya and raised as a citizen in indonesia.   For better or worse, this is a fact.   i just read there is a lawsuit to stop him from being able to be the president.   my question is, with this known, how can he still run for president?

I tend to think they know the only real experience Obama has is as an orator. That is why they consider him qualified to be President. And if he makes a mistake at what he does best, it shows a flaw that they are not willing to admit.      You think I am right on this?       I can't see why they attack a private middle class citizen so vehemently for his opinions.

20081102150807AAYlArn	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do some people equate socialism with stalinism?	Especially Americans, who when you talk about socialism some of them say things relating to the Soviet Union and how if there was to be socialism in the US they'll have to stand in breadlines and etc. Do they not teach what socialism is in some American schools? I find it amazing because I was taught about it when I was 14, but you see some grown men not having a clue about what socialism actually is.

Ohio has already had problems with early voting & from what I've read, people aren't exactly comfortable with the idea of having a radical politician at the head of the white house.

20081027132711AADgR71	Politics & Government;Elections	Would this be a good idea?

I have a friend who works for one of the larger law firms in my state, a democratic state, the senior partner is the head of Obama's campaign in my state. He has made it mandatory that all associate's work a 14 hour day at a polling station and to ONLY help democrats that have a problem voting. They are to inquire who the person was trying to vote for and if they were trying to vote for a republican not to offer assistance.

Se si parla di qualsiasi altra cosa certi utenti chiedono fonti,link,prove e articoli dettagliati?      Mi spiego meglio:si dice che la Carfagna abbia avuto rapporti sessuali col premier:può anche darsi.   Di sicuro io non lo so,perchè prove CONCRETE al riguardo,checchè se ne dica,non ce n'è.      La domanda è soprattutto per quegli utenti che prendono per oro colato le dicerie se fanno loro comodo.      Al contrario,se posti qualcosa che non è di loro gradimento,ti subissano di richieste di prove,e,nel peggiore dei casi,ti danno del qualunquista,per non dire peggio.

20081028123108AAp4TSZ	Politics & Government;Elections	I'll admit that John McCain is a good man, will you Republicans admit that Obama is a good man?	I think McCain is a good person though I think he's impulsive and angry and makes bad decisions, but I'll stop short of calling him a complete evil corrupt oil baron.  But I keep hearing attacks from the Right that Obama is friends with terrorists, or hates America.  This is bizarre and outlandish.  Can you guys show you've made your decision based on serious consideration of the two candidates campaigns and policy objectives, not on the basis of unfounded smears?
20081028065130AAw6zxx	Politics & Government;Elections	Should I still vote for John McCain if my parents want me to vote for Barack Obama?	I am a 21 year old African American female. This will be my first election that I am voting in.       I want to vote for John McCain because I really like Sarah Palin. I am a  Christian and a social conservative or religious right. My views tend to fall in line with the McCain/Palin ticket.      But my parents are kind of mad at me because I want to vote for them. They want me to vote for Barack Obama. Because it would be a historic moment if he did get elected.      So I am kind of undecided right now. Should I vote for Obama, become a registered Democrat, and go along with history but sacrifice my religious beliefs or do I just disregard what my parents want me to do and vote for whoever I want?       I don't want to make my parents mad. Because we were watching CNN and I told them that I was thinking about voting for McCain/Palin and my mother got mad and stormed out of the house at 10:00 at night and for 2 hours we didn't know where she was.       What are your thoughts???

20081027071325AA4kfpm	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do people fear loss of jobs under Obama. . .?	There have been 735,000 jobs lost just this year alone under the current Republican president.  Obama has said that he will end tax breaks for those companies who ship jobs overseas.  He also said that he would give a $3,000 tax credit to any company who creates a new job--$3,000 for EVERY new job they create.  To me, this seems like a stimulation for job growth.  Why is everyone falling for McCain's "Joe the Plumber" scare tactic when he has said nothing about creating jobs for the middle class?  Don't you people get it?  McCain is a fear monger just like our current president!

20081028094215AATwp0T	Politics & Government;Elections	Should voters be required to pass a test?	It's a sad state of affairs that far too many American citizens do not even have a remote idea of how the US came to be, the Constitution, how our Republic is supposed to operate, etc. I'm not talking about left or right, I'm talking about the basic facts.      Should everyone have to pass some basic "hey buddy, ever hear of the Constitution" type of test? I suppose its a pipe dream since everyone would try to inject left or right spin into the test. It just ticks me off that I take the time & effort to educate myself on the issues, only to have my vote negated by some knucklehead who votes for "Joe Candidate" because they saw the name on the back of a bus or something.

20081102174805AAmwa1T	Politics & Government;Politics	Is anyone surprised how stupid Americans are?	Somehow, the Democrats have done a wonderful job of laying the blame for our current recession on Republicans. And because of their expert job of manipulating public opinion, they stand to gain control of the Executive and Legislative branches of our government...and then Judicial in a few years when Obama gets to replace existing judges.      But how are we, as Americans as a whole, stupid enough to buy into this story?      In 2005, Senator John McCain and the Senate Finance Committee tried to bring to the floor of the Senate a bill to pass oversight on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But that bill was stopped dead by the Democrats on that committee, saying that Fannie and Freddie were fine and needed no oversight.      In 2008, Senator Dodd even went as far as to say that we should trust in Fannie and Freddie to right themselves.      And in 1995, Bill Clinton passed CRA1995, which deregulated portions of the banking system and required banks to make loans to unqualified borrowers based on a new point system - a point system that escrewed the credit report and instead awarded loans based on a point value generated by the person's income level (lower the better), race, and neighborhood of residence. And banks that refused to comply were harassed by (wait for it...) ACORN until they complied.      While I'm not saying Democrats are solely to blame, a fair (if not majority amount) of the blame is on their shoulders.

20090114174111AAGBL62	Politics & Government;Politics	Question about British people and Islam?	Well, I've been reading the Yahoo Answers board on a regular basis.  I've noticed that the British people - perhaps they're in their teen years or they're full-grown adults - on Yahoo Answers generally despise Islam because they fear it may ruin their British culture.        My question is:  British culture exists in small towns or villages, no longer in bigger cities. The bigger cities, where most Muslims live, have been taken over by Americanization - that is, the establishment of American companies and media.  Americanization overshadows the influence of Islam.  Isn't it reasonable to be more worried about Americanization ruining the British culture?  American movies, songs, technology, companies, products, services...      Only serious and mature answers will be considered.  Any racist comments will be ignored.

20090205170019AAkrtHT	Politics & Government;Elections	Is government spending socialism?	Is government spending socialism....and does that mean that Bush was a socialist, since discretionary spending went up faster during two years of his term than all 8 of Bill Clinton's?      Or is Socialism actually what it says in the dictionary.....government ownership of businesses/industries.....much like what happened under Bush?      Do you think it's possible that if Obama isn't able to stimulate the economy enough to get out of the recession we are in, it would cause a major depression, and result in true socialism....where government is forced to take over many industries?      Could spending now actually be the catalyst to PREVENT socialism, much like it was during the Great Depression?      Just wondering.

"WASHINGTON — The husband of President Obama’s Labor secretary nominee paid about $6,400 Wednesday to settle tax liens that had been outstanding for as long as 16 years against his business, the Obama administration told USA TODAY this afternoon."         Committee Republicans have held up Solis’ nomination since she appeared before the committee last month, in part because of questions about her service as an unpaid board member and treasurer of a pro-union nonprofit, American Rights at Work. The group’s disclosure reports with the Senate say it spent $110,000 in 2007 and $200,000 in 2008 on lobbying, primarily to support legislation Solis co-sponsored that’s designed to make it easier for unions to organize.       "Solis did not list her board membership as required on her House financial disclosures. In written responses to questions from Republican committee members, Solis said the omission was "an unintentional oversight" she had corrected last month by amending her reports with the House clerk’s office"          http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/... 
20090205162004AA0ytKw	Politics & Government;Immigration	Does this pretty much sum up the issue of illegals?	A common tactic employed by immigration proponents is to accuse opponents of racism. They charge that opponents want to deny a new breed of immigrant the chance to become Americans as many of our immigrant forefathers did. They paint a Norman Rockwell-type picture of honest, hard working immigrants, planting gardens, working in fields, doing the work “no Americans want to do.” So, in town after town across the nation the battle rages. And that is really the point. Illegal immigration is not just a border issue. It is a national issue affecting every large city and almost every small town. It must be understood that illegal immigration is not just a matter of some unhappy peasants hoping to seek a better life. It is a $300 billion a year industry, combining the interests of multinational corporations with those of drug cartels and Latino street gangs. Caught in between are American communities and the American way of life. Some cities, especially those along the points of entry at the border have become dangerous no-mans lands, where no property is safe, no American citizen is able to leave their home unarmed and some politicians turn a blind eye as they profit under the table. As a result American civilization is beginning to break down. That is why so many Americans refuse to back down on the issue, continuing to demand a crack down, no matter what name calling they must endure.   Senator Gillibrand’s position on illegal immigration represents the position of the vast majority of those New Yorkers who have taken the time to understand what the true cost of ILLEGAL immigration is costing their communities.      The issue is simply about the abrogation of law. The effort needs to be focused against the individuals, businesses and politicians who create this problem and cheat honest business owners and workers by allowing illegal hiring practices under the table. In short, the issue is about enforcement of the law, cost and corruption.

Chief Performance Officer: Nancy Killefer - STEPPED DOWN: Failed to pay employment taxes on domestic workers.       Health and Human Services Secretary: Tom Daschle - STEPPED DOWN: Failed to pay taxes on the personal use of a car and driver provided to him by a firm for which he was consulting. Also had a conflict of interest associated with speaking fees he had received from health care interests.      Treasury Secretary: Timothy Geithner - STILL AT LARGE: Failed to pay all of his taxes on income received from the International Monetary Fund in 2001 and in three subsequent years.      #2 Defense Department Official: William J. Lynn III - STILL AT LARGE: Recently lobbied for military contractor Raytheon. I guess Obama forgot about the time he said that "I don't take a dime of [lobbyist] money, and when I am president, they won't find a job in my White House."      Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services: William Corr - STILL AT LARGE: Lobbied through most of last year as an anti-tobacco advocate.      Question: If Obama was really serious about taking responsibility for having "screwed up" and embracing a new kind of politics, why are their still tax-dodgers and lobbyists in his White House?

My parents have to go to court tomorrow for this witch I think is stupid, Here is the situation, around last year, in the start of November 5th I think it was, we where pulling out of the parking lot in Giants, and we wanted to go out, and we did, So when you pull out of the shopping center, it's like a stop light, and we where behind this SUV van, and a lady was standing there with her baby, we thought they where just talking, cause you know how people ask for directions, but later we found out there was a wreck, because the car was little in front of the big SUV car, so, the cop did not have his lights on, he was parked two streets away, he was kinda of a prick, and we did not know so my dad beeped the horn, for the lady to move so we can turn around, and then the cop comes running to the car, and said hey you don't beep the horn there is a wreck here, so snobby sounding, my mom never got into trouble before with tickets, at all, and he was just screaming like a maniac, he was a young guy to, and then he gave us a ticket for blowing the on for non sense, well we thought the lady was just talking we did not see there was a wreck to my mom talked to the lady, and then the cop made us wait there for like few longer minutes everyone thought was where broke down.      Then when the copy was behind us, he turned his lights on and finally after the last minute, but the thing is though, What do you think of that?      We just wanted the lady holding the baby to move out the way, and we did not see fully what was going on, and also, my mom did not want to sign a ticket unless there was another officer out there, so we called one out and then he writes us another ticket saying refuesed to sign ticket, I think that was dumb, my mom was worried about it the entire time, and then my parents have a court date tomorrow, what do you think and my mom went on the internet and there aint no law for blowing the on,
20090205174216AAEa2VO	Politics & Government;Government	What do you think about the delay Congress put on the digital tv switch?	Government agencies, consumer groups, television broadcasters and other parts of the industry have invested more than $1 billion over the past several years to educate consumers about the shift to digital broadcasting. The message all along has been that analog signals would be shut off on Feb. 17. This aggressive campaign has pushed consumer awareness rates well above 90 percent, they have been working for almost three years to educate consumers that this is the day that will be the digital tv switch. How are they going to recreate that? It will also be costly  forcing the government and industry to pour more resources into additional public service announcements and outreach efforts. At this time, with the economy struggling like this, why do they need to worry about people being unprepared for a tv switch, there are radios and by now they should be well prepared. Shouldn't the government be more concerned about more important issues? Opinion?

20090205175407AAMnYjB	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Police psychological test?	For a police cadet position, I had to visit a psychologist as one of the last stages in the whole hiring process. During the interview with the psychologist, he brought up the fact that he is going to reccommend to my background officer that my history with underage drinking (which is not TOO extensive) might be an issue of compulsive behavior.       **Mind you that my past alcohol use has already been discussed with my background officer, and I have taken a polygraph, and my friends and references have been interviewed, to validate my answers. And if my drinking history was a serious issue, I wouldnt be this far in the hiring process anyway.      So, after the psychologist told me that he thinks my drinking was an issue, he sort of paused and waited for my response.       If you are a psychologist, is this a tactic that is often used to test somebody's response to an issue like this?      Do you think that the psychologist brought this up, and said that he is going to tell my background officer that it might be an issue, ONLY to see how i responded to the news (in order to test my temper)? OR, do you think he really is concerned that my drinking is indicative of impulsive behavior.

20090205171138AAUbMmC	Politics & Government;Politics	Conservatives, how well does this describe your ideal family?	I'm reading the book "Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think" by George Lakoff. The basic thesis is that liberals and conservatives have different conceptions of the ideal government because they have different conceptions of the ideal family. Conservatives emphasize discipline and respect for authority, while liberals emphasize a nurturing environment and open dialogue with authority.      My question is: how much do you agree with the thesis, and how much do you think the follow statement describes your ideal family?      "This model posits a traditional nuclear family, with the father having primary responsibility for supporting and protecting the family as well as the authority to set overall policy, to set strict rules for the behavior of children, and to enforce the rules. The mother has the day-to-day responsibility for the care of the house, raising the children, and upholding the father's authority. Children must respect and obey the parents; by doing so they build character, that is, self-discipline and self-reliance. Love and nurturance are, of course, a vital part of family life but can never outweigh parental authority, which is itself an expression of love and nurturance -- tough love. Self-discipline, self-reliance, and respect for lefitimate authority are the crucial things that children must learn. Once children are mature, they are on their own and must depend on their acquired self-discipline to survive. Their self-reliance gives them authority over their own destinies, and parents are not to meddle in their lives."

My family was recently forced to file for a peace order in the state of Maryland to remove an extended houseguest from our home.  The district court issued a final peace order with the added instruction she was to pick up her personal property today 2/5/2009 between the hours of 0930 and 1530 with a police escort.  The respondant showed up this morning without any help, or a proper vechicle.  The deputy with instruction of his shift commander refused to stay while she made multiple trips.  She left our property around 1230 and never returned to claim any more property.  There is a fairly large amount of furniture left unclaimed.  I fear moving it to one central area in my house due to fear of possible civil action due to damage.  I want to return my home to normal, and would like some advice on my options be it a petition to the court or hire a lawyer (and what specialty).  I dont want this to turn into a financial or legal nightmare any further than it already has.

20090205175547AAkhMoi	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should we contest power of attorney?	My grandmother has Alzheimer's and a long while ago when she was still in a mind to do so, made my aunt power of attorney. I'm not sure what exactly it encompasses, but as far as I know it's for her to decide legally for my grandmother every decision from medical to finances.    Now that my mother lives closer, she goes over to my grandmother's every day twice a day to make sure she eats, takes meds, etc.  My grandmother is really far gone, and from what I know she should have been in a facility at least five years ago but my aunt always refuses, especially now. We recently found out that some of the household bills for my grandmother are not being paid, and there's speculation that my aunt is using my grandmother as a cash cow. The problem with this is that if she is, I know it must be out of desperation, because her husband, my uncle has had seven heart attacks and a bypass in the last three years, so things must be hard on her all around. But if she is, it's no excuse. My question is though, can my mom and the other siblings contest the power of attorney? Would it be worth it? I think it would benefit all around if my grandmother could be taken care of in a facility equipped to deal with people with this disease. My mom and her other siblings can't be there 24/7 and there's no way for her to be moved in with anyone in the family, none of us are trained in this sort of thing anyway, and we're all worried she'll do the cliched turning on the burner and dying in a fire.    Any one have experience in this? Should they contest my aunt's standing as power of attorney? Especially since it seems finances aren't being handled properly and that she is in need of more detailed care and isn't getting it?   Thanks to anyone who can help.

By Russ Dallen   Latin American Herald Tribune staff      SAO PAULO -- General Motors plans to invest $1 billion in Brazil to avoid the kind of problems the U.S. automaker is facing in its home market, said the beleaguered car maker.      According to the president of GM Brazil-Mercosur, Jaime Ardila, the funding will come from the package of financial aid that the manufacturer will receive from the U.S. government and will be used to "complete the renovation of the line of products up to 2012."      So was the bailout of the beggers 3 a real good idea now that we know how they are spending our tax money?

20090203064630AAI2TMI	Politics & Government;Politics	Is anyone else disturbed by the amount of pro Obama commercials on TV these days?	I've been noticing a lot of strange commercials on lately. There are privately funded commercials supposedly from independent, nongovernmental sources that are simply saying that all of Obama's decisions are right.       But now the Obama administration is getting involved in commercials, a USA Today article was titled, "Obama Plans Media Blitz on the Stimulus Plan". This is weird... since when does a president push his political ideas on people after the election via TV and radio?       the first part of the article reads, "President Obama planned Tuesday to blanket US television with the message that Congress must approve hundreds of billions of dollars to fight off economic collapse."       I don't know what he plans on doing with this, it's not like the public can over vote the Congress.    Ive also seen a commercial that seemed like it was trying to push for Judd Gregg to leave the senate and join the Obama cabinet,       (And for those who don't know, if he did leave then a Democrat would more than likely be appointed by that state's Democrat govoner which would give the Dems almost free range to do what they want without Republican opposition.)      So finally here is the question, Does this new pro Obama plan ad campaign have you raising an eyebrow?      personally I think it looks like propaganda or a more intense level of government brainwashing.

I have a strong belief that socialism leads to horrible things.   It enables people to become lazy and careless while a government is promising them stress-less and carefree lifestyle.      With health care people move around the world to get the proper needs met and socialism makes it extremely hard to get it. Many people move to America so they don't have to wait for several weeks to get something done or die while trying. I believe that America is being led to Socialism. Agree? Or Disagree?            Note: Please answer with an open mind and explain your answer. Don't just say, "OBAMA IS TRYING TO HELP US!" Because quite frankly, I didn't ask that. Also, If you are non-American what are your stories with government and do you believe America could be going toward this?

I was driving down a road that goes from 35 to 50 and was less than 50 yards from the sign that posted 50 when I was passed by a police officer coming from the opposite direction. He turned around and pulled me over a couple minutes later claiming that I was driving 58 in a 35. I don't believe I was going that fast...50 at most.       I don't speed often, but I was running late and had to bring my sister to work before I could go to work myself. This is my 2nd speeding ticket ever (7 years driving) and I have no other kinds of tickets so I was a little upset that I wasn't given a warning or a reduced ticket...$230 is a lot of money when you can't afford it. But I'm not one to tell the guy how to do his job, he was polite and considerate about it, at least.      I don't deny that I was speeding, but I was wondering how radar works. Can radar be used while driving, especially while driving toward one another? I'm not trying to get out of the ticket, b/c I was in the wrong, but I think my speed may not have been accurately measured and I just want to be sure that I'm not being screwed.      Thank you for your help.

Can anyome get more info on this or possibly check what is the right code name? To help I think it was the vietnam war, thank you in advance.
