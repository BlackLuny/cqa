Here are the cold hard facts:      Reagan increased government spending by 92% while lowering the government's share of total economic production from 22.2% to 21.2%      Clinton increased spending by 32% and lowered the government's size as a percentage of the economy from 21.4% to 18.5%.      GW Bush increased government spending by 68% and increased the government's share of the economy from 18.5% to 22%      If you're truly, honestly concerned about big government, then you should support Democrats.      Obama says he'll raise spending this year and next, then bring it back until it again represents 22 percent of the economy at the end of his first term.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/200903...

Seems like these days, I meet so many younger vets who have received discharges with conditions other than honorable or even bad conduct (BCD) or dishonorable discharges (received due to special or general courts martial.) All of them swear up and down to me they're going to get them upgraded to honorable.       I've been out of the Marines for more than 25 years but back then I was a legal services clerk, and I remember being told that it was next to impossible to do that. Has that really changed?       Personally, I don't agree with upgrades...to me if you screwed up, then you should take your medicine..."upgrades" dishonor those of us who did the right things while on active duty and earned those Honorable discharges.       So anyone know if anyone's ever really done this or are these folks just talking smack?

Ok, so here's the deal- My boyfriend is in the Marines and he is across the country from me right now so the only contact we have is over the phone.  I really hate talking on the phone, to anyone.  I'm just not a phone person.  It feels awkward for me to talk to someone that I can't see and I feel like I can't communicate everything I want to say when I'm not with him in person.  I was wondering if anyone had some tips on what kinds of things I can talk about when we talk. I think another main reason that it's hard to talk on the phone is because he is always in a bad mood because he hates it where he is at. What can I say to brighten his mood and let him know that I'm there for him?

20090306224846AAHiiqI	Politics & Government;Politics	Question about fiscal conservatism?	If I get conservatism, it basically says:   Less gov't interference and low taxes should spur the most growth in the economy and benefit the most people in theory.      But it is claimed (by conservatives) that the financial crisis was sparked by dems trying to help the huge numbers of poor Americans own homes.  How could a system be that stable if the gov't trying to help the huge number of existing poor people cause the whole house of cards to come falling down?      Was the system that stable to start with?   To be a good system, either fiscal conservatism would have to prevent less poor people from existing, or be strong enough so that gov't assistance would not cause chaos in the markets. right?      Can you have a system where in which, as long as the gov't does nothing to help those people down the street, then most of us are fine.  But, if the gov't tries to help the poor, then were all screwed.  This doesn't seem to make any sense.      Yes/No ------- Opinions?
20090306222422AACg8ZK	Politics & Government;Politics	Question for conservatives about the motives of Democrats?	If I understand correctly, most democrats pander to the poor and downtrodden in order to get their vote and make them dependent on gov't.  Hense the high taxes, the welfare, the housing projects and all of the other stuff that is designed to keep people poor and a slave to the system.      My confusion is this: Democrats interfered in the market in order to help poor  people get houses by enacting and enforcing the Fair Housing Act which forced banks to give loans to people who likely could not pay them back.  Thinking being, that if poor people can get into homes, instead of rent, they could build equity and eventually achieve social mobility. But, if this is true, wouldn't home ownership make the poor less dependent upon the gov't, which contradicts the dems first goal of keeping them poor?      So, Dems try to keep poor people poor, but wrecked the economy trying to help them own homes, which would get them out of poverty.  Do I have this right because it seems to make no sense.

My opinion, Love who you Love.

So my friend has a son whom he helped to raise with the baby's mom until he was 3 or so...then they ran into problems in their relationship. He moved to another state and she asked him to sign the papers to give up his parental rights. He said no, but didn't show up for court so supposedly his rights were given up by default? This took place in California. Years later, he really misses his son and would like to try and contact the mother.

So isn’t it fair to say Yeah When Obama is right or at least on the right track Ok or at least here the opinion of anyone else besides those that agree with him then He (Obama) can be worked with?       But since he don’t need the right one lick to pass anything (so long checks and balances) and he don’t need to be bi-partisan then he don’t care if we work with him or not         He can say what ever he wants but, the truth is a funny thing and actions speak louder than words      for example lets work on this or compromise on this    The Republicans have laid out a plan, for example, rather than spending a billion dollars on the Census, $300 million to buy federal government cars, instead of all the wasteful spending in the stimulus, why not do what they first said they were going to do: let's do targeted infrastructure investments, let's do tax breaks, let's lower permanently the tax, lower tax breaks on the lower tax brackets in the income tax, let's cut taxes on capital gains, let's give a more aggressive net carry forward of losses for small businesses.  Here's the fundamental disagreement.  We think we do need to work to get the economy moving.  We think it's more important to get the private sector moving rather than just spending government money.  We need to focus on getting our businesses to hire people to create jobs.  That will help to address the challenges that our country is facing.

Didn't we learn over the past 8 years that "trickle down" doesn't work? Obama's plan is no different than giving tax breaks just to corporations and hope that it gets to the people.

20090227053439AAvR4pS	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are most people ignorant of the fact that Hitler was a Keynesian?	source:  http://www.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/hitl...       For today's generation, Hitler is the most hated man in history, and his regime the archetype of political evil. This view does not extend to his economic policies, however. Far from it. They are embraced by governments all around the world. The Glenview State Bank of Chicago, for example, recently praised Hitler's economics in its monthly newsletter. In doing so, the bank discovered the hazards of praising Keynesian policies in the wrong context.      The issue of the newsletter (July 2003) is not online, but the content can be discerned via the letter of protest from the Anti-Defamation League. "Regardless of the economic arguments" the letter said, "Hitler's economic policies cannot be divorced from his great policies of virulent anti-Semitism, racism and genocide…. Analyzing his actions through any other lens severely misses the point."      The same could be said about all forms of central planning. It is wrong to attempt to examine the economic policies of any leviathan state apart from the political violence that characterizes all central planning, whether in Germany, the Soviet Union, or the United States. The controversy highlights the ways in which the connection between violence and central planning is still not understood, not even by the ADL. The tendency of economists to admire Hitler's economic program is a case in point.      In the 1930s, Hitler was widely viewed as just another protectionist central planner who recognized the supposed failure of the free market and the need for nationally guided economic development. Proto-Keynesian socialist economist Joan Robinson wrote that "Hitler found a cure against unemployment before Keynes was finished explaining it."      What were those economic policies? He suspended the gold standard, embarked on huge public works programs like Autobahns, protected industry from foreign competition, expanded credit, instituted jobs programs, bullied the private sector on prices and production decisions, vastly expanded the military, enforced capital controls, instituted family planning, penalized smoking, brought about national health care and unemployment insurance, imposed education standards, and eventually ran huge deficits. The Nazi interventionist program was essential to the regime's rejection of the market economy and its embrace of socialism in one country.      Such programs remain widely praised today, even given their failures. They are features of every "capitalist" democracy. Keynes himself admired the Nazi economic program, writing in the foreword to the German edition to the General Theory: "[T]he theory of output as a whole, which is what the following book purports to provide, is much more easily adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state, than is the theory of production and distribution of a given output produced under the conditions of free competition and a large measure of laissez-faire."      Keynes's comment, which may shock many, did not come out of the blue. Hitler's economists rejected laissez-faire, and admired Keynes, even foreshadowing him in many ways. Similarly, the Keynesians admired Hitler (see George Garvy, "Keynes and the Economic Activists of Pre-Hitler Germany," The Journal of Political Economy, Volume 83, Issue 2, April 1975, pp. 391–405).

Sales of “Atlas Shrugged” Soar in the Face of Economic Crisis      Washington, D.C., February 23, 2009--Sales of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” have almost tripled over the first seven weeks of this year compared with sales for the same period in 2008. This continues a strong trend after bookstore sales reached an all-time annual high in 2008 of about 200,000 copies sold.      “Americans are flocking to buy and read ‘Atlas Shrugged’ because there are uncanny similarities between the plot-line of the book and the events of our day” said Yaron Brook, Executive Director at the Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights. “Americans are rightfully concerned about the economic crisis and government’s increasing intervention and attempts to control the economy. Ayn Rand understood and identified the deeper causes of the crisis we’re facing, and she offered, in ‘Atlas Shrugged,’ a principled and practical solution consistent with American values."

A Madison biotech company is offering what it is calling a mental stimulus package to government officials who forget to pay their taxes.      Quincy Bioscience will provide free bottles of its flagship brain-enhancing supplement, Prevagen, to any member of Congress or the Obama administration who has forgotten to pay taxes during the last 10 years, the company said this morning.      “We’re confident that after 30 to 60 days of taking the supplement, most legislators and government officials will recall, without being reminded by aides or reporters, all tax periods for which they have forgotten to pay state or federal income taxes,” Quincy Bioscience president Mark Underwood said in a news release.      Prevagen is so effective it also should help most government officials recall when they failed to make Social Security and Medicare contributions for undocumented household workers, Underwood said.    http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/24/har...

Don't misunderstand; Fannie and Freddie were certainly guilty of having management and accounting problems, but it seems that any Republican will quickly chant "FANNIE AND FREDDIE" as soon as the housing crisis is mentioned.      Most don't seem to understand that Fannie and Freddie had strict lending standards to the loans they underwrote and most of loans they backed were prime, and not sub-prime.      It was the private sector that issued the most sub-prime mortgages and issued the most mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  Sub-prime MBS were the most risky and what helped bring about the economic crisis.  It is these companies that share most of the responsibility for the failures of the financial sector.      But it seems Republicans just like saying "Fannie and and Freddie!" so does an angel get her wings or something when they blame Fannie and Freddie?

20090306235146AAC9qcE	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How many of you believe the National Stimulus/Bail Out Package is going to FAIL?	...cause I just know it!      First of all, if your reading this, then you are one of 50 people who actually do their homework & use 10% of their brains.  I commend you & thank you for your time reading this!      Second, if you voted for Barack Obama, I would like to say, "Shame on you!"  Why?  Because the man has NO EXPERIENCE with business fundamentals.  The same goes for our current congressmen & congresswomen.  To all those who voted for Obama, I would like to say, "Your vote is going to bite you right in the butt," because he is in support of the National Bail-Out plan.      For all those n00bs out there who no nothing about Obama, here's a little history lesson.:      Barack Hussin Obama II's History:   1.  Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA in 1961   2.  Graduated high school in 1979   3.  He attended Occidental College in LA in 1979   4.  He then tranferred to Columbia University in NYC in 1981.  There he worked in  the Business International Corporation for one year (one year is NOT enough experience, according to the US National Better Business Bureau [BBB]!)   5.  Four years later, he created Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based community organization.  He also help set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.  Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.  (Hmm...these firms seem to be nonprofit organizations.  Repeat after me:  Volunteering DOES NOT equal a J.O.B. in terms of standards, job orgainization skills, & experience.  Is just physical labor at no cost.  Disagree with me if you want, the profit made by nonprofit organizations speaks for itself!)   6.  He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991 with a Juris Doctor (J.D.).   7.  He taught for 12 years in Harvard Law about constitutional law.  (Was that his only job?  Probably not.  Too bad he's never started he's own business.  Nowadays, in our latest economic struggle, we really need a president with some business common sense.  Looks like were screwed.)   8.  He was a State Legislature from 1997 to 2004.   9.  He was a US Senator from 2005 to 2008   10.  He became the first black president in 2008  (Strange.  I feel as though people were more interested in making history than actually deciding who was the right candidate for the job.  John McCain may have supported GW Bush, but from what I have read, he seemed to have had the strongest business logic.  Bush was stupid!  Bush hesitated too quickly when trying to fix our business sector & he thought too rationally at times instead of thinking toroughly before fixing the problems.  That's the only reason why he was a bad president.  Oh plus he approved of some of US Congress's regulations, which in this moment, which caused the recession to last longer.  Sadly, I feel Obama came into power for all the wrong reasons.)        His campaign slogan:   Obama:  A New Era  (Ha!...Bullshit!)       Now, let's talk about the National Bail Out Plan:      What's in the Bail-Out Plan:   1.  The government is suppose to borrow $2 Trillion from foreign countries(Is is really worth the sacrifice?  I think not.  We are already have a national debt of $1.5 trillion.  But if we combine the amount of debt of every individual, every corporation, & every government agent, we get a sum of $10 TRILLION!!!.  Believe it or not, this is true amount of debt we owe ourselves & other foreign nations.      So let's do some math to predict the total amount of debt if the National Bail-Out Plan is passed:         What year did we devlop our national debt?      Ans:    1940.      So:   2009 - 1940 = 69 years   1.5 T + 2 T =  2.5 T       What will be our national debt on average in the next 69 years,  if the stimulus package is passed?    Ans:        69 yrs * 2 = 138 yrs      2.5 T / 69 yrs = newDebt / 138 yrs   newDebt = 138 * 2.5      new Debt =   $345 TRILLION!   ....AND THAT'S ONLY THE AVERAGE!! o_O                   How much will our total debt be by the time, if the stimulus package is passed?    Ans:          We already know, on average, we will have a $2.5 T national debt   So,       currentRate = currentAverageDebt / currentTotalDebt   newCurrentTotalDebt = currentRate * 2.5 T      newCurrentTotalDebt = (1.5 T / 10 T) * 2.5 T   newCurrentTotalDebt = 6.67 * 2.5 T      newCurrentTotalDebt =  $16.7 TRILLION ....<---  THIS WILL BE OUR NEW NATIONAL DEBT ON AVERAGE, IF THE NATIONAL BAIL-OUT IS PASSED!             How much debt in total will we owe the next 69 years, if the national bail-out is passed?    Ans:        16.7 T / 69 yrs = newTotalDebt / 138 yrs   newTotalDebt = 138 * 16.7      newTotalDebt =  $2304.6 TRILLION --or--  $2.3 QUADRILLION!!!!                 If my math doesn't convience you, then you shouldn't vote, shouldn't start a business, shouldn't go to school, & shouldn't live in the USA (sorry for the harshness, but its a FACT:  People with no political logic & n

My husband and I are currently going through a divorce and there has been no property settlement agreed to at this point.      However, there were several things he and I agreed that he would pay for, but he is now refusing to do so because I contested the marrige due to the fact that the agreement we made was nowhere in the complaint for divorce.      Now he is wanting to come get his boat out of my yard, which I currently have chained to a tree because I was told that no property should exchange hands until a final order is issued from the court stating who pays for what and who gets what property. In fact, he has refused to allow me back into our marital home to get the remainder of my belongings as well.      Should I notify the police that I have done this because my husband is claiming that he is going to come over this weekend with the police to pick it up?       Also, since we are still married, does is matter that the title is in his name only? Can I actually get into trouble for doing this because he's making it sound like i'm stealing it, even though he parked it her almost a year ago and hasn't been back since?      Thanks for all the answers, and just FYI, we are in Michigan if it makes a difference.

20090226183342AA0EuZF	Politics & Government;Politics	People are constantly saying " he has only been in office for a month, give him a chance"?	Are they blind ?    The proposed budget spends TWICE the assumed government revenues. This is based on an assumption of 3.2% economic growth when the best economic estimates stand at about 1.5%   Add to that the spending bill aka "stimulus".   The warnings of another $2trillion of "stimulus" that may be needed.   And we are on track to borrow nearly twice as much money in two years than we have in the previous eight.   Increasing forces in Afghanistan and keeping 50,000 troops in Iraq for "the foreseeable future.   Increasing the 'effective tax' on all Americans, due to the national debt increasing by nearly 40% in two years, the rising cost of electricity due to the 'cap and trade' emissions program, the increased costs of goods and service brought on by the added costs incurred by businesses by the 'cap and trade' program among many others.      What more do they need to see?   The last administration had major issues, but in one short month the proposals of the current one are going to make that previous one look 'fiscally responsible'.   All we face now is 'more of the same' fiscal irresponsibility we have endured. The only "change" is that it looks like it will be twice as bad.

Think for a moment, $1.75trillion deficit in a budget of $3.6trillion. That is spending almost TWICE what the national revenues are estimated to be.      And it doesn't include the nearly $1trillion spending package aka 'stimulus' that was just passed into law. Not even the billions that will be needed for continuing military operation in Iraq. (plans are to keep 50,000 troops there for the foreseeable future) or the escalating actions in Afghanistan. Or even consider the estimated $2trillion that the administration has said may be needed for further 'stimulus' bills.      The last administration had major issues, but this administration already out of control in just one short month.

I'm 18 and I'm enlisting for 2 years active duty as 11B Infantry with 6 more years of reserve. My recruiter told me that I'm not eligible for a bonus of any kind because I'm enlisting for such a short term. He suggested me to enlist for 3 years active instead of 2 but I said no.       I don't want to enlist for 3 years active duty because I heard that if you enlist for more than 2 years, they are more likely to station you overseas and I really don't want to do that.      But I also heard on YA that I AM eligible for a bonus of $10,000 after all despite my short enlistment term. Is this true? Is the recruiter lying to me? How do I approach him about it if he IS lying?

My Blu-Ray disks, DVDs, and games are not recognized in the Playstation 3 anymore. The system froze up during online game play, and I manually turned the unit off from the back. The laser then stopped working. I was on the phone with Sony customer service, and was told they had never heard of the problem I was having (of course not), but 213 other people from this website had the same problem:  http://www.fixya.com/support/t448106-pla...  . If Sony acknowledges that there are other cases like mine, their liability goes up. They made me feel like my case was isolated and random. I didn't search very much to find the fixya website, and I'm sure there are tons of other sites with similar posts. I would like to get started with a class action lawsuit. I have been in contact with a few people from the forum, and will be contacting my lawyer in the morning, but any ideas from you right now would be really helpful, thanks.

Texas Congressman and former presidential candidate Ron Paul was a guest of Shuster’s last week and wouldn’t take his bait. But, unlike most Republicans, he wasn’t afraid to criticize Limbaugh.       Further, he said he would debate him.      “I was disappointed with Rush because he is a good conservative, yet he hardly said hardly boo against George Bush,” Paul said. “He supported all that big spending. Did he complain about George Bush? Did he complain about all those wars that were going on that caused us so much trouble?      “That’s the kind of issues that I want to talk about. And I will be quite willing to challenge Rush Limbaugh on those issues. But just to pick out a word or two and say, he is wrong, I don’t think that solves any problems.”      Why has Rush completely ignored Ron's challenge to a debate? Does he know that Ron would crush his credibility?

20090307102653AAkhQHj	Politics & Government;Embassies & Consulates	Can someone tell Obama to answer the clue phone?	The Obamas, Barack and Michelle both, pretty much diplomatically botched the recent visit of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife. Oddly enough, the U.S. Old Media seems uninterested in the story that is a hot topic in England, a story that's left many Brits a bit miffed.      As the visit of the national leader of our closest ally began, the President informed the Brits that he wouldn't be attending the joint press conference that was planned to be held once PM Brown's plane touched down. This threw the visiting delegation into a tizzy leaving them scrambling to explain the sudden change in plans to the folks back home. Still, meetings were had and things smoothed out. Eventually the visit seemed to right itself... then came the Obama's gift gaffes.   It is well understood that visiting diplomatic delegations come bearing gifts and gift giving is returned in like fashion by the host country. It is an ages old human practice in diplomacy after all. Usually the gifts are valuable, representative of the products of the nations involved, or at least symbolic of the history of those nations.      For his part, PM Brown gave two symbolic gifts and one that expressed national pride. Brown came bearing a pen holder carved from the timbers of the sister ship of that which gave the wood to create the famous "Resolute Desk," the desk that has been in America's charge since 1880. He also gave Obama the framed commission for that famous ship, the HMS Resolute. His third gift was a seven-volume biography of one of England's greatest leaders, Winston Churchill.      So, what did President Obama give the British PM? 25 movies on DVD. Yeah, that's it. Brown gives a symbolic gift like the pen holder fashioned from a famous British warship and Obama responds by sending a staffer to WalMart to pick up a few quick movies.      How thoughtful. Or not.      And I'm not the only one to scoff at this thoughtless gift. The entire British press is up in arms. Many in Britain are seeing this as entirely gauche and indicative of the low esteem in which the Obama's hold England.      Worse, no one is 100% sure that Obama was smart enough to know that DVDs made in America don't play on European DVD players. American DVDs are created in the "Region One" format while those in Europe play in "Region Two" format. A U.S. DVD just won't play on a machine made for the English market.

20090307125316AACQ7o2	Politics & Government;Politics	How Can There Be a Fair Debate About Healthcare When the Most Popular Model Is Eliminated From the Discussion?	While the President said every idea must be considered, the idea of creating a single-payer national health insurance program has already been rejected. White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said Thursday, “The President doesn’t believe that’s the best way to achieve the goal of cutting costs and increasing access.”       Initially, no supporters of single payer were invited to the summit. After protests were called, the White House invited Democratic Congressman John Conyers and the president of the Physicians for a National Health Program.       Major newspaper, broadcast and cable stories mentioning healthcare reform in the week leading up to President Barack Obama's March 5 healthcare summit rarely mentioned the idea of a single-payer national health insurance program, according to a new FAIR study. And advocates of such a system--two of whom participated in yesterday's summit--were almost entirely shut out, FAIR found.      Single-payer--a model in which healthcare delivery would remain largely private, but would be paid for by a single federal health insurance fund (much like Medicare provides for seniors, and comparable to Canada's current system)--polls well with the public, who preferred it two-to-one over a privatized system in a recent survey (New York Times/CBS, 1/11-15/09). But a media consumer in the week leading up to the summit was more likely to read about single-payer from the hostile perspective of conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer than see an op-ed by a single-payer advocate in a major U.S. newspaper.      Over the past week, hundreds of stories in major newspapers and on NBC News, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, NPR and PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer mentioned healthcare reform, according to a search of the Nexis database (2/25/09-3/4/09). Yet all but 18 of these stories made no mention of "single-payer" (or synonyms commonly used by its proponents, such as "Medicare for all," or the proposed single-payer bill, H.R. 676), and only five included the views of advocates of single-payer--none of which appeared on television.       http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/6/as_...        http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm        http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/03...

If someone celebrates gluttony and achieves a weight well over 300 pounds (with a body mass index classified as morbidly obese), is that as unhealthy as a sinful homosexual who practices that lifestyle? Shouldn't we ignore the morbidly obese since their lifestyle is only defiling their own holy vessel and in no way an affront to devout clergy such as the Catholic Priests?

They act as if the "rich" are sooo good for the economy, yet they criticize Paris Hilton like the rest of us. Seems silly to me that these middle-class (not even upper-middle class) people believe that taxing the rich is sooo bad for the United States. For one thing, there's only 146,000 families in the U.S. that even make more than $1.5 million a year, and with nearly 305 (soon to be 306) million people, that's way less than even 1% (which would be 3.05 million math experts). And if you consider people who make $250K, then yes, it would be 1%, but how much can that whole 1% perfect be tax if the ones 146,000 who make over a million get taxed first. I think its silly that some Americans believe rich care about them. America is a business and apparently its newest venture is making dumb Republicans think the CEOs of Sears or Walmart actually care whether Obama takes a few millions away from the $$billions$$  they annually make. Then there's people talking about the poor. Well, its really dumb to think only people who are on welfare are poor. Bush made the rich only richer and the poor only poorer. Sounds like Calvin Coolidge's same policy in the 1920s and that certainly made thinks better in 1929 did it?

However, after doing some of my own research and after seeing a couple spots on the news, I have to say that I'm a little uneasy of the direction our country may be heading in.  From what I've seen, a supposed 800 'detainment' camps have been set up around our nation for the holding of American citizens in the case of an instilled Martial Law situation.  Now I really cannot attest to the validity of the numbers of these camps, or to their actual purpose, but the fact that so many are reporting on them is a little disconcerting.  I as a member of the military and a proud American citizen feel it is our right and responsibility to stand up against such action were it to take place.  So, I'd just like to know what everyone elses take on these camps is.

When government maniaclly insists on hammering square pegs into round holes, they destroy our nation.      They continue to put our country in grave danger with their folly. Some are guide my greed, others by their gullible ignorance. The result is the same, failure and ruin.         I am convinced the attachments, bonds and caring is being universally destroyed by evil fools in high places who are sadistic and enjoy power and inflicting misery on others.      iIt makes them feel like demigods, much like a child pulling the wings off flies. until these powerful people are identified and removed, things will only grow worse.

20090307143623AAqXBP6	Politics & Government;Politics	Good things about 9-11?	Ok let's get something straight first, i am NOT a conspiracist, and i think 9-11 was awful. Many inocent people died that day because of what happened due to another countries supreme hatred of the united states. but some good things that happened are:   1. America pulled together as a nation- we set aside and political beliefs and pulled together as a nation. WE gave everyone including the 9-11 families the assurance that american can get through anything.   2. Airport security DRAMATICALLY increased-  with new things like terrorist threat levels, we were shown that we were making an accident waiting to happen, happen. But now there is so much security that it is unbelivable. THIS IS A GOOD THING! People should not be allowed to get away with what they use to on planes.      ****ANY RESPONSES/OPINIONS PLEASE ANSWER BELOW**** :)
20090307144555AAf9eXx	Politics & Government;Elections	How to win my high school election?	Im running for ASB Secretarty. I really want to win, but need some help. I have written a speech, but I don't know if it is any good, the election is one Wed. and I have Mon. Tues. to camapign. Im the least popular canadaite, Im running against a varsity basketball player, and a cheerleader. I play sports and am involved in some clubs, but not as well known, and am a little shy, but I really want to win this election.       Here Is My Speech:      Why are we here? Why do we come to this place we know as school? This is a question that ran through my mind once or twice before. For a few of us, it’s because we like school, we like to learn new things. For many of us, it’s because it’s required to some degree. For the rest of us, it’s for friends or sports, and to make sure we don’t end up flipping burgers the rest of our lives. Me, I’m in the learning category. I strive to achieve great things, to challenge myself , and  come up with solutions that someone may overlook. I’m a detailed person, and though I sometimes procrastinate, like most people do, I always seem to get things done.      For those of you that  know me, you know that I am everything I’ve said, I try hard, I’m honest and determined. You know that I would go to the end of the world and back to prove myself right, or by doing so, end up proving myself wrong, and that I NEVER accept defeat willingly.     As your ASB Secretary, I believe that I can put my skills to good use, and work hard to improve the school we all love. When I say we, I mean it literally, this isn’t just my school, its our school. Its not what I want that matters its what you as the students want. This is a very important concept to me. That changes to our school should come from the people. And, You Are The People.     Though I don’t know many of you, I will work hard for each and everyone of you. Doing things asked by you, to help improve our school. If elected the first thing I would do is create a suggestion box, Giving power to our people. Though I can’t promise that all suggestions will be made into solutions, I can promise I will try my best to make them happen. Because, I mean, there are some restrictions on the power of an ASB officer.     I’m a pretty friendly person, if elected, and even if not, you can come up and talk to me. If you have an idea for improvement, you need a friend, concerned about a class or anything, or you just need someone to talk to, I’m all ears, I’ll listen.     Being secretary means a lot to me. It gives me the opportunity to help and improve the lives of my fellow students. It means changing the way things operate in our school. Improving classroom conditions, creating fun school activities, organizing clubs, mixing and changing things up, and who knows what else.    As ASB secretary I Allyssa Hall promise to do whatever I can, to the best of my ability, to improve our school. I hope that when you vote, and I hope you do vote, that you will vote for me Allyssa Hall for your ASB Secretary. You don’t have to, but if I was someone else, I would vote for me. Together we can make next year the best year ever.     Allyssa Hall for ASB Secretary       Sorry this is so long. If you could please give me input on my speech, campaign slogan ideas, and ways to get elected, or be more funny, or anything really, I would really appricitae it.       Thanks

20090307143122AAO8qXE	Politics & Government;Politics	Which political viewpoint is this?	I'm trying to work out what the technical term is of these political beliefs:   - Money should be abolished and what people earn should be the product of how much they work, and everyone should produce their own food   - All political set ups should be removed and all matters should be discussed at a local level   - No class systems, everyone as equals   - No countries or political borders.      I don't know the first thing about politics, but I would like to know the technical name for this viewpoint. I presume it is linked with communism a bit, but there should be no revolutions involved. Is there a name for a particular brand of politics that links to this utopian viewpoint?
