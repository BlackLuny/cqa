20090309133319AA1SuKI	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How is this for the beginnig of my story i am making up?	“Help! Help!” people screamed all around me. My head whirled around.   I clutched my knees tightly to my chest, my palms sweating. Tears and blood trickled down my face, squashed beneath all the rubble of the burnt down building. I was so scared I wanted someone to cuddle up to and tell them all the worries I had, I wanted my mam. I realise now that my mam is my hero, I didn’t think I would have a hero but I do she was there all along when I needed her. I need her now.    I never wanted all this; I didn’t want my life filled with danger and death.   Now that I think of it I was better of as an ordinary girl, so brainy and such a swot who everyone picks on and forget her name. But its to late now to late to go back to the my ordinary life now its come to this. I know I shouldn’t have done it I just wanted to be normal is that so bad to ask for? May be I did it because I felt sorry for that man who searched for sympathy saying he didn’t have long to live and how I’d loved to see the world the way you do in my last moments of living? Maybe I new he was evil and lying? Maybe I was the one who caused all these deaths and all the screaming of people in pain as the burning building falls to the ground.   I remember when my life was so different to this before I got my so called gift. Why is it a gift when you can play with the lives of people? And Whatch the ones you love die?

First of all, I came above average in all my classes this year. I have improved my already good marks this tearm, and I get my report card in 2 weeks.I am in the french Immersion program. I got straight A's. What do you think of my course choices?      Secondly - The courses go like this    Locally Developped - School to Workplace   Applied - School to Apprenticeship   Academic - School to Collega/University   Enriched - School to University      ____________ I am taking      Immersion French (Better than Enriched Core French)      Academic Geography ( I'd have taken Enriched only it's mandatory to be in french for the immersion kids, and they only offer Academic)      Enriched Science      Enriched Math      Enriched English      Family Studies      Dance      Co-Ed Gym (Also mandatory for French Immersion)      So, what do you think? I really want to take enriched geography,as it's one of my favourite subjects and a possible future career choice but I also want to REALLY graduate with a bilingual diploma, and you can only get those in immersion. Should I Take Enriched Core French and Enriched Geography, or stick with French Immersion and take Academic Geography?

20090309160249AAVj5qn	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Can I Sue my College for Dis-enrolling me without telling me?	Hi! Sorry, this will be kind of long and complicated but here it goes:   To start, let me please explain really quick: I am a HS Grad from another country, {US Citizen} and I had to go through a company called ECE to validate all my HS info before enrolling in this school. I ordered 2 sets of documents, one for school, one for myself, to have as well for the future. I received my copy, assumed school got theirs.      I enrolled on an "Online Art School" {a certain Institute that is very well known, you might know what I mean now} in September 08. I got a mix of Grants and Loans to pay for this OH Very expensive school. Started classes, have been doing very well. These classes last 5.5 weeks, did my first "term" of classes {2 total}, all fine, did the second, everything well {1 class} when I went to log in for my next set of classes {2 of them} I was not able to. this was on a Friday, so, after a few calls to different departments, I found out on Monday that I was put on "hold" because they never received the documentation from ECE. I think to myself "Easy, just call them and have them send the documents" called them, had them send the papers to the school, I also faxed the papers to the office to expedite me being able to log into class.    5 days  after school started, I'm finally able to log back in class. I find a mountain of homework and assignments to catch up with. I talk to my instructors, explain them the situation, they decide to work with me to catch up with my classes.    I get an email, from someone I had never talked to on the school, telling me that I had to log in, post my assignments or I'd be dis enrolled. I reply back, explain the situation, and go about my business catching up with all these assignments {HUGE assignments by the way, required days of work, nothing easy at all} Oh, did I mention, this was on a Thursday, Friday I was trying to post.   When I log in, the next day, to post my assignments, I see my classes have been deleted off my account. I call my student advisory, who tells me that I was dis enrolled because I never logged in {which, I did, to get the assignment info and introduce myself, by the way} but said not to worry, I could just re-enroll for the next 5.5 weeks coming up, and that should even it all out and that there was no problem.    I believed her. I think to myself, oh good, then I'll have more time to make the assignments better, I already have the books and the materials, this is great, I need a break.    Not quite the case. They sent me to collections. Now, I have a collections person from their own company, email me not 2 days later telling me I owed the school almost 5,000.00   I'm obviously confused, I ask for more info, he explains me that my student loans never got to pay them. I'm even MORE confused now, so, I call my bank, and they explain me that they did in fact pay them, a total of almost 6,000.00 ...SOOO, I'm thinking to myself, well, it's just a small accounting error, I decide to download all my financial info off the school website to go line by line and see where the mistake was done, I worked on billing for a very long time and have gotten good at this, wish I had paid attention earlier though!    Anyways, I print it all out, and I see all the payments the bank gave them, I also see where they credited me for the classes I was dis-enrolled from ... the charges are because they refunded to the government ALL the grants they gave me originally.    At this point, of course, I have lost all faith in this school. All this has happened in a matter of less than 2 weeks. And now they are requesting a "review" to ... well, I'm not even sure who, but they are making it sound like they're doing me a favor by asking "someone" up there to please forgive me from dis-enrolling and get me back in class... when all this was caused and started by them.    So, my question is, do you think I have grounds for suing this school?  If so, What would the term be? I just fail to see where and how this is my mistake, when I was never warned, told, explained that they were missing some paper that I had and just plain blocked me from class and then, before letting me resolve the issue, dis-enroll me for reasons that are based on nothing, as I had already worked something out with my teachers? Is this even legal?      Ooops, sorry this was so long, any help would be greatly appreciated.

20090309162707AAse70Q	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	I need a dose of hope?	I know the rotten economy is affecting alot of people.  It is affecting me greatly.  I have a very weird situation.  For the past 2 years I have struggled with college and certain jobs I have applied for.  I suffer from a learning disability which hampers my ability to understand and grasp concepts as well as an anxiety disorder.  I tend to become very anxious with jobs when I feel they are over my head.  It's a cycle I'm having a hard time breaking.  What happens is when I begin to get confused at a job or college I start to feel my head spinning.  I get very disoriented, nervous, sweaty, and scared.  I have to ask a ton of questions just to understand technology or concepts that are difficult for me to perceive.  I panic because I feel the world around me collapsing.  Due to this I had to leave those jobs. I did fine in high school with my disability because I found ways to compensate for them.  I can memorize things and feed them back very well.  Anything that is technical or math based I just don't get.  So I have found a solution to my problem.  For now I plan on concentrating on jobs I know I can learn without stressing myself out.  That way I can build my self esteem and start setting goals like going to a vocational school again.  A couple of years ago I graduated from BOCES with a horticulture/landscaping certificate.  I was thinking of going back for conservation. Vesid would pay for that if I am found to be eligible. I know I work well in green houses and grocery stores.  I used to work in a grocery store and could hold down the job.  Your probably wondering what is the problem.  Well, the economy really stinks and I've applied to all of the green houses that are nearby a month early as well as the grocery stores nearby as well.  The competition for any job is really tough out there, even for seasonal.  I feel the work I can do is pretty limited because I don't know how to cope with my anxiety and learning disability in more complicated jobs.  I want the opportunity though.  I want to be successful.  I have contacted VESID which helps those with mental and learning disabilities.  The problem is they don't have an opening for orientation until 2 months from now in May.  I feel like I'm stuck. I want to go forward with my life, secure a full time job, continue my education, and plan my wedding.  Instead I am stuck at home doing everything I can to better myself.  I am attending job fairs and work shops on job skills.  Does it sound like my case is hopeless?  Things are bound to look up, right?  Do you think my disability makes me eligible for VESID?  What else can I do in while I fight my battle of waiting?  Is anyone else in a situation like me?

I have a BA (in communication), and plan on returning to school in fall to get a Masters in Ed.  I have gotten several calls for jobs for 2 hour jobs.  I just got one for a job tomorrow from 2:30 to 4:00.        I really have a problem getting ready for a job 12 miles away for such a short period of time.  I can't imagine it being worth anyone to go in for such a brief period.  What's worse, is if you decline a certain number of jobs, you're taken out of the system.        My friend is a teacher in Ohio and has never heard anything other than full or half days.  But, she said they're paid per day, not per hour like us.        Are sub 3 hour jobs common anywhere else, or am I in a strange district?

I'm not that well informed on gun control, so if you know more than I PLEASE let me know!   Pro gun control means people are willing to compromise some of their time (like in an airport security check) in order to fill heavy paperwork before buying a gun, in means to filter out people who should not be buying guns.   Another aspect of gun control seeks to lessen the amount of guns open to the public.      Anti-Gun control are offended by this because they feel its hurting their freedom.   They also feel that government should not tell who gets and who doesn't get to keep a gun.      Very debatable subject! Please help me out!

Okay, my current situation is that I will be a licensed Cosmetologist in June. This is when I was supposed to graduate high school, but due to personal and family reasons, I missed a lot of school last year. Which means, I'm behind a few credits that I couldn't fit into my senior schedule. My guidance counselor suggested coming back until january of next year to make up those credits and get a high school diploma.   I currently attend an alternative school that includes GED classes, and my school district is willing to pay for me to take the GED test. If I did this, I would be done by June and be able to go right into work at a salon.   I do HAVE to move out of my mom's house in June-July and I'm going to need all the hours at work I can get. Thus, I'm not sure if it's worth going back and wasting those hours in high school when I will already be in the profession I want to work in for the rest of my life, and I could already have my GED by then and just be done with it.

I'm a junior in high school yet I've been doing the age-old college search and through it all the top two schools that I have heavy interest in is Stanford U and Caltech.      BOTH are amazing schools, I know that, yet when it comes to this fall to start applying I'll be getting a little nervous. If by springtime I get accepted to both, I really don't know which one I'd pick.      I've visited Caltech before and I really love the campus and almost everything about it, however, I'm not too totally sure how good their biology program is, especially since they dont have a med school, and Id have to transfer out to another grad school for PhD and all that jazz. And btw, Caltech has always been my "dream" school.      For Stanford...well, all I need to say is Stanford. Its an amazing school with a good undergrad program, yet their med school is primarily research-driven, and I want to go for being an actualy doctor in practice.      When it comes down to it, I'm VERY capable with being in either school academically [I'm like, 8th in my class] yet there are so many things to think about to choose between them. What school would you pick if you were in my situation?? Any advice/tips/comments would be helpful, especially if anyone has been to either college or goes there now.

Thomas Hobbes and John Locke wrote about the social contract.      The Declaration of Independence split the United States from the rule of Great Britain.       Joseph II ended serfdom in Austria.      After the American and French revolutions, colonists in Latin America pushed for independence.

The US Constitution divided power among three branches of government: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.      Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry called for independence from Britain.      Leaders of the French Revolution stripped power not only from the monarchy, but also from the nobility of the church.      Principles of the scientific method were applied to human behavior.

20090309130205AAxvK0i	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help with my persuasive speech intro...?	This is the intro to my persuasive speech. Can anyone suggest how I could make it better...Any help os greatly appreciated.       I. Last year sports illustrated ranked the top 50 earning professional athletes in the United States. 306,000,000, that’s what the top five athletes made last year adding together all their salaries and all the endorsements that they got. This is an outrageous amount of money to make for any job let alone for playing a sport. You may not think about it much but it’s actually the fans who don’t make much who really pay these athletes most of the money they make.    General Purpose: athlete’s salaries are a topic that people neglect to think about.   Specific Purpose: understanding the athlete’s outrageous salaries, maybe the fans can make a change and bring them down a little.    Thesis: athletes are undeservingly overpaid, in a society where some crucial careers are overlooked and underpaid and together we can make a small change in all of this.

20090309131926AA4VA6Z	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Opinions please !!!!!?	I have already asked for help with this and I used some of the ideas given by people so thanks for that. I was just wondering though if anyone could read what I have so far and give opinions on it, any constructive criticism. I have changed the angle which i am looking at the idea slightly but this is just for fun. (see my other question for the bakground behind the idea)      I recently found myself sitting in the corner next to my closet contemplating how messed up life had gotten lately, when a shoe fell from my closet. I sat there gazing at the shoe thinking to myself for a moment, what it is about something as simple as a shoe which attracts women all over the world…Alexander McQueen, Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik, Prada, Vivienne Westwood…what is it about these designers and their incredible shoes which makes almost half the worlds population swoon at the sound of the names. Perhaps it is the longing to strut down the street, head up high, feeling confident, all eyes on you for once, this was a plausible explanation, still though, what is about these shoes that makes women feel this way. Then it hit me…      …If a woman could choose her path in life like she chooses her shoes then it would be expected than this same feeling would occur. Therefore life and shoes must have a lot in common, mustn’t they? I pondered for a while over this idea and the more I thought about it the more sense I saw in it.      Impulse buying,  a danger for any woman. You see a pair of shoes in a shop window and think you have immediately fallen in love. You spend every last penny you have on this pair of shoes and cant do anything for ages afterwards, but it’s okay because they’re worth the investment. You wear your new shoes on a night out, they go down a treat, everyone loves them and you feel fabulous all night. You get home take your new shoes off and throw them to the back of the closet. For the next few months you try as hard as possible to find another occasion to wear the shoes or an outfit to match them but it seems like a lost cause and eventually you give up…so were the shoes really worth the investment???   Now think of the shoes in this situation as a man…you see a guy in the street, he’s the typical ‘tall, dark and handsome’ and you think it’s love at first sight. You use all of your resources and blow off all of your friends trying to find this guy, fully aware that your friends will not forgive you. You fantasise about meeting him and when you eventually find him you arrange a date. However when you meet you don’t quite hit it off, you realise that you loved the idea of this guy but not the actual guy himself. You are left all alone with no friends anymore…so was the man really worth giving up everything for???

Thank you:)      "In the first stanza he is trying to introduce the main idea of the poem.  The poem opens with a joke - as if “half-caste” means only half made so the speaker stands on one leg as if the other is not there.      In this part he compares having parents of different background to mixing colours. He is angry and frustrated because people call him half-cast. He wants to show that this term is offensive and that he is not treat equally because of his background.       As he get more angry about the term half-cast he starting to speak Caribbean. By mixing two languages he wants to show that he is comfortable with his background.          And again, he wants to show  how the greatest artists mix things - Picasso mixes the colours, and Tchaikovsky use the black and white keys in his piano symphonies, yet to call their art “half-caste” seems silly. In this stanza he is asking questions why people don’t call piano music half-cast if it is mixture of black and white keys.      In this stanza the writer of the poem is challenging a potential reader because by writing “Ah listening to you” he wants to show that he has willing to hear other opinions and different points of view.      This time by suggesting that the “half-caste” uses only half of ear and eye, and offers half a hand to shake. By extending the idea of being “half” to the individual parts of his body he wants to show how stupid it is.        He also is taking a miki of the reader because if he is a half person he has just a half of shadow. By writing “I dream half- a dream” he wants to show how sill the idea of being half of something and I think it is hurtful to the poet because people thinks that he is different because of his background.      I also would like to mention that he doesn't use the standard form of punctuation."
