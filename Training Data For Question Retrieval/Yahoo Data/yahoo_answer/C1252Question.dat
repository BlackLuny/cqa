They don't fight for dominance like lions and tigers do.   .......Lions and Tigers are the superiors , they don't fear each other and they don't respect each other.

A certain brand of fruit-and-cereal bar contains 160 food calories per bar.      1.) If a 65.0 kg hiker eats one of these bars, how high a mountain must he climb to "work off" the calories, assuming that all the food energy goes only into increasing gravitational potential energy?   h=_____m   2.) If, as is typical, only 25.0 \% of the food calories go into mechanical energy, what would be the answer to part (a)? (Note: In this and all other problems, we are assuming that 100 % of the food calories that are eaten are absorbed and used by the body. This is actually not true. A person's "metabolic efficiency" is the percentage of calories eaten that are actually used; the rest are eliminated by the body. Metabolic efficiency varies considerably from person to person.)   h=____m

My thought was that someone said the gods from sumeria where able to describe the planets and knew we went around the sun, yet no one had proved this anytime near then.. so is it possible people came from planet x?? would that me that we first came from there and earth wasn't our real home?? and someone said the planets on a drawing on stone weren't accurate.... won't have things changed since that drawing??? like planets blowing up like what happened to mars.. would that have happened since the drawing? would that be the reason that is wrong???    here's one of the websites i was mainly looking at:    http://www.xfacts.com/x2.htm

What is the electric field at the midpoint between the two charges? (kC = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2).      I've been trying to figure out this problem but can't get the correct answer.  The answer is suppose to be 1.3 x 10^9 N/C.  I'm using the equation E = kC (q1q2/r^2).  Can anyone please help me get the correct answer?  Thank you!
20090222214034AAitHze	Science & Mathematics;Physics	NEED HELP with last physics problem. With kinetics I believe.?	1.A particle experiences a constant acceleration that is north at 100 m/s2. At t = 0, its velocity vector is 70 m/s east. At what time will the magnitude of the velocity be 100 m/s?       This is what i got so far, but i believe i might be right.   So far I know:   ax (constant acceleration) = 100 m/s^2   Velocity initial = 70 m/s (initial because time starts at 0 correct?)   Velocity final = 100 m/s (same theory applies to how i found velocity initial)   time = ? (what I need to find)      I find a suitable kinetics equation: vfx - vix = ax*deltaT   apply my simple algebra skills and get an answer of .3 seconds. But apparently that's not the correct answer. What am I doing wrong here? Am I suppose to consider vectors too?
