BSnwIJ0oaa	When most people use the term "mirror," they are referring to what is known as a plane mirror. A plane mirror takes the light that hits it and reflects it back. Mirrors used for common consumer purposes are of this sort.<br>  <br>  A mirror is essentially a highly reflective surface. The sorts of mirrors one sees on walls or in bathrooms are of a type known as back-silvered mirrors. This means that the reflective surface--in most modern mirrors this is aluminum--is viewed through a thin layer of glass. The glass protects the aluminum from scratching and bubbling, but also distorts the image somewhat.<br>  <br>  Early mirrors were created by simply polishing a suitable substance until it became highly reflective. Neolithic mirrors have been discovered, made by grinding down obsidian rocks and polishing them to an incredible sheen. These mirrors have remarkable properties, allowing even subtle details to be clearly seen in their reflections.<br>  <br>  To make a Neolithic mirror, one need first find the right stone--ideally, obsidian. A rougher stone is used to grind the base stone down to a flat surface on one side. After a flat surface is achieved, a finer grinding stone and clay slip can be used to polish the stone to a fully reflective sheen. Extremely fine abrasives, such as ash, can help further. After a substantial amount of time and effort, one will have created a very primitive form of mirror.<br>  <br>  Modern mirrors, however, are made using an entirely different process. By taking liquid metals and allowing them to condense on a sheet of glass, one can get a surface far more reflective than anything achieved by polish. Making a mirror can be done at home with only a few supplies easily acquired at a local chemistry shop.<br>  <br>  With pure silver nitrate, distilled water, and ammonia, one can make a mirror virtually indistinguishable from those purchased at a store. The process (in abbreviated form) involves dissolving a small amount of silver nitrate in distilled water, then adding diluted ammonia until the mixture goes through distinct chemical changes. A second mixture is made using silver nitrate and Rochelle salts. This mixture must be boiled and filtered. By pouring these mixtures on to a very clean piece of glass sufficiently heated to the proper temperature, the silver will precipitate and form an even coating on the glass. After drying, one can coat the back of the silver with a solid paint to help prevent degradation of the silver. The result is a fully functional mirror.<br>  <br>  Commercial mirrors are manufactured in more or less the same manner as is described above, though materials such as aluminum might be used instead of silver. Mirrors produced for specialized purposes, such as lasers or telescopes, are manufactured using much more exacting techniques to acquire a much more precise mirror, but the general principles remain the same.|`|gdPdtEjtaa	they are transparent , having no colour

The explanation of course being the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus.    Deniers don't have much to say about this except that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 on Earth is much less than on Venus.  Nevertheless, it's a perfect example of a runaway greenhouse effect in action.    *edit* hah sorry, but you don't actually expect deniers to click a link to a scientific website do you?

People want to believe that they are basically good, but causing global warming is damaging, so to reduce this "cognitive dissonance, they are faced with the need to build a case against the facts:    "Cognitive dissonance can be reduced in two ways: a) adding new beliefs or b) changing existing ones. Adding new beliefs can reduce dissonance if the new beliefs add weight to one side of the conflict or if they reduce the importance of the dissonant beliefs. Likewise, changing existing beliefs reduces dissonance if their new content makes them less contradictory with others or their importance is reduced."  http://www.cs.umd.edu/Honors/reports/Sch...    In other words, they MUST believe theories which say that global warming is not an issue by adding new beliefs, even if those new beliefs are based on wacky, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.

The only problem, Venus does not have any carbon sinks (well at least not for roughly the past billion or two years).  Many people think Venus is Earth's "sister" planet, when they have very little in common.  When the sun was a baby star and Venus was young, there may have been a possibility that Venus once held water and/or plant life.  But as the sun expanded and the planet was stripped of those carbon-eating objects, the greenhouse effect "ran away".  The planet also takes 243 Earth days to spin on it's axis, the Earth is 23.9 hours.  It takes longer to complete one spin on it's axis than it takes to orbit the sun.  As the Earth slows down from the moon moving further away (billions of years), it will have a similar long day.      For Earth to go through a runaway greenhouse effect, all of the planet's water and plant life will have to be stripped away in a similar fashion.  Being that it will take the sun another billion or so years to expand to a similar distance from Earth, there is no reason to be so "alarmed".    The theory of a runaway greenhouse effect is sound, but the Earth does not currently have the capability of that.  As long as we have water, we will have clouds.  Increased heat creates more cloud cover.  With heavy cloud cover over the planet, the Earth will cool and send itself right back into an ice age.    Atmospheric composition:  Venus:  * CO2: 96.5%  * N2: 3.5%  * SO2: 0.015%  * Ar: 0.007%  * H2O: 0.002%  * CO: 0.0017%  * He: 0.0012%  * Ne: 0.0007%    Earth:  * N2, 78.08%   * O2 20.95%   * Ar 0.93%  * CO2 0.038%   * trace amounts of other gases    earth's atmosphere once had more than 10% concentration of CO2, yet there was no runaway greenhouse effect.  Why?  That is a mystery and most scientists believe because of the massive oceans and plant life.|`|t1zlbOURaa	It's really close to the sun and has a much different chemical makeup than the earth.    It's like asking apples: "just how do you explain oranges?"|`|T9vf2uU7aa	It's 30% closer to the Sun, mate.  And, the planet's atmosphere absorbs some of the emitted infrared radiation (which is received initially from the Sun). The composition of the atmosphere determines how much is absorbed. The more CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere, the more infrared it will absorb. This warms the atmosphere and the process will continue until the amount of infrared leaving the atmosphere equals the amount of incoming sunlight. On Venus, the temperature in the atmosphere must reach 750 K before equilibrium is achieved.
HlTF3X3Baa	Probably the scientists weren't surprised. But dumbass hysterics made a political cause out of it, similar to the global warming scare.        Did you know that Duponts patent on R-12 was about to expire at the time ? And that they also had the patent for the replacement for it ? (at much higher price, and lower efficiency).

But like anyone else, scientists are people too, and if they hear something enough without actually doing a little research for themselves, they are likely to buy into it.  And for many more than I'm sure you'd like to acknowledge, grants, stipends, and allocations by government and private organizations are their livelihood.  If you take away the money that was specifically given to "study the effects and possible solutions of man made global warming", the second that person either decides it's all a giant farce or that the solutions have been found, the flow of dollars ceases to continue.  So not only is the money a factor for those receiving it, but the stated objective of said money was already swayed to begin with by studying the effects and solutions of an issue that hasn't evne been shown to be reliable based on the empirical evidence and history.|`|FY5fccoZaa	Yes, the arguments of GW deniers are so funny!    First they accuse climatologists as being "leftists" and USA enemies, and then they cite from Pravda some Russian scientist who is a denier too. Very amusing indeed.  Also they (deniers) don't have a coherent theory to support their thesis. At one time they say we are just out of an ice age period and it is normal for the temp to rise, then they say we are entering an ice age and the temp is already falling, afterward they say the temp is indeed rising but it's the sun to blame, then they say there is cold winter in half US so the temp is falling, and so on.

I'm not saying we shouldn't try to project future conditions, but one should take the results with a grain of salt.    The earth has warmed over the last century. Those are findings and I don't doubt them (much). There is a correlation with atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. There doesn't seem to be anything to doubt there, but correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation. But the dire predictions based on computer models that have never been released or had the assumptions in them fully vetted - sorry.

But what other conclusions can one draw when they behave the way they do?  We have this testimony before the senate:    Dr. David Deming (University of Oklahoma)   Around 1996, I became aware of how corrupt and ideologically driven current climate research can be. A major researcher working in the area of climate change confided in me that the factual record needed to be altered so that people would become alarmed over global warming. He said, "We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period."    Time and time again Steve McIntyre has tried to get the statistical  methodology from various scientists (Mann, Santer) to try and reproduce results and he is constantly denied.  Then you have the current fiasco with a new study that showed Antarctic warming and the bad data that was used:    http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=5077|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It is very simple.  Those that don't find crisis don't have any need to be funded.  The ones that remain find crisis.  The feds threw so much money at it that most of the new people going into it had a stake in there being global warming.  That hasn't changed.  If global warming is true or not doesn't change the fact that people's paychecks and careers depend on them finding that global warming is harmful and caused by humans, not just that it exists.  I hope you aren't suggesting that scientists who went into the field to "study" human caused global warming are going to threaten their own jobs by suddenly reversing field.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Will they manipulate their findings? In some circumstances they will.   That is part of what they do.  They manipulate their analyses based on thier findings.  If they don't find what they expect, the look harder.  Those things that make sense to them, that fit their views of the world are credited and that data that doesn't isn't.  When Piltdown Man (a hoax) was "discovered" the scientists of the day were eager to accept it.  It provided them exactly what they were looking for, a large brained hominid with apish jaws.  When actual potential human fossils were found such as Australopithecus Africanus by Raymond Dart which didn't fit their preconcieved ideas, the scientists ignored that data.  If you think that preconcieved ideas and biases don't play a part in scientific research, I think you are naive.  It shouldn't but it does.  Global warming is no different.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	James Hansen manipulated temperature data that wasn't his own.  He deleted it and replaced it with false data that he concocted, which then went to "prove" his alarmist global warming ideas.  The whole idea was to get more funding, which he got, before he got caught.    Last I heard NASA GISS was still working to restore temperature records to what they were before Hansen got his hands on them and falsified the data.    He certainly did it for funding, as well as to prop up Gore.  I find it amusing how the warmers here try to defend his honor.

Not every scientist will manipulate their results. Occasionally, there will be a scientist or two that will manipulate their results because of the funding or because of their job. But it's not just scientists that 'could' fall into manipulating the results. Have you been paying attention to the news - the peanut butter incident in Georgia? They continued to do tests until they got the results they wanted.     Anyway, it is obvious that you have no background in any of the sciences or you would know that there are many issues in how scientists get their results. Yes, scientists will submit a grant proposal for money from an agency. A lot depends on the available funding and the potential success of the project. As a graduate student in wildlife biology, I would never consider lying or manipulating my results because of a grant or a job. I would present my results the way that I got them. The wording of the results do depend on who you are reporting to. It would probably do you some good to take an environmental or wildlife conservation policy course. Don't criticize things that you don't understand.     To me, it sounds like you are an ignorant conspiracy freak.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	It's really sad that the two most frequent arguments we get from deniers are    1) Global warming has stopped because of    a) winter weather, or  b) statistically insignificant cooling trend which happens roughly once every decade  http://greenfyre.wordpress.com/2008/12/0...    2) "Follow the money" a.k.a. scientists are falsifying data or committing some other form of fraud to get grant money.  Anytime I cite a peer-reviewed scientific study I can guarantee that a denier will call it "propaganda" or say the scientists authoring the study are just trying to make a buck.    The problem the deniers face is that virtually all climate scientists agree that the planet is warming and humans are largely responsible.  http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Dor...    So if you're in denial and the experts almost universally disagree with you, what are your options?  Not many.  Basically, you have to find a reason that the experts are wrong.  And since they certainly know more about the science than you do, the denier is left with only one option - find a way to dismiss the scientific findings.  And the only way to do that is if there's some sort of bias among the scientists.  Hence the "follow the money" argument is born.    Of course this argument requires that literally tens of thousands of climate scientists are all part of a vast conspiracy.  And it also requires that the few 'skeptical' scientists for some reason or another aren't exposing this theory.  The real killer for the deniers is that guys like Richard Lindzen and Roy Spencer may disagree with the causes or effects of global warming, but they don't claim it's all a conspiracy or that other scientists are falsifying data or perpetrating a fraud.    It really goes to show how desperate the deniers are that they resort to such laughable conspiracy theories.

You can expect the believers to get more and more shrill and nutty as it becomes more and more obvious that they're wrong.<br>  <br>  In the end, it will be one screaming naked dude running with a sign down the national mall in the snow.<br>  <br>  Then it will be over. (hope the last guy is Al Gore, just to hear what his "friends" say about him then.)|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The government can botch anything! Global warming is happening -- that is just a fact. U can argue all U want on what is causing it. But the government can waste money on anything!<br>  If people would use common sense about a lot of things we could all be better off. If people did not buy over priced, manufactured food stuffs, then we could save a lot of money there. Just wait until the "free" government supplied water is no longer available to farmers out west, and watch what happens to food prices. This will happen sooner than U think. <br>  Most persons in the USA do not realize that the government (TAXPAYER) subsidized water is what gives us cheap food. When that program crashes due to mismanagement of water resources --- look out. Then global warming will pale by comparison. <br>  And just as a side note, the government has done a lot of weird experiments that the general public does not know about, that has contributed to strange weather patterns already. If U want to amuse yourself, go do some research on the tides of Nova Scotia and the bays areas of the north-west coastlines of the USA.  Also check out E.L.F; towers and the damage they do. So much to learn if U know where to look.|`|AA11946554	Probably not. Investing in new jobs and technology would definitely help to get money flowing...<br>  I know some of you have a problem with change (I will admit it's a pain sometimes) but deal with it. It happens and the ones that survive are the ones who adjust.<br>  Edit: I would agree that the free market would ultimately decide but climate scientists are trying to get attention to the subject but deniers keep spreading false info-the govt is trying to help get it going...|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Only if the entrenched industries continue to bribe senators to stop them from actually doing anything to keep us from  advancing to already available 21'st century technologies.   The country as a whole is living in the past.   All we have to do is accept new, efficient ways of doing things and we could keep our lifestyles as good or better than they are now while helping out the environment too.|`|sSvPEf97aa	I think it already has.  Not only do we pay tax dollars to subsidize corporate welfare programs like solar energy, wind power, and corn based bio fuels, but then we also have to bear a greater cost of electrictity and food.<br>  <br>  This is done despite that a free market will acomplish the same goals without raising prices on those who can least afford them<br>  <br>  The free market would accomplish the same goals with out the extream expense associated with gvmt programs.|`|AA11105711	The problem with the US economy is a cash liquidity problem.  I see no connection to climate change.
P8gGMlbIaa	Global warming is a fraud. The Earth has been cooling for the past decade. Scientists have been lying about it for government grants fro research. The Government blacklist any one with an opposing opinion on this whole thing to the point that they are not willing to discuss this. They just claimed discussion closed before there was even a chance to. What kind of NAZI like way is that to be civil about all this?  Yes, I'm calling the Global Warming crowd the Nazis they are.    Even if the ice melts New York isn't going to flood because scientists say the east coast is still rising from the weight of the last ice age.    So what was it that allowed the Vikings to settle in Greenland 500 years before Columbus crossed the Atlantic? And after several decades had to abandon those settlements because of a cooling climate? I'm sure they could first settle there because of the heavy industry and large vehicles of the Roman Empire (sarcasm).    Global Warming is a fraud as is any one that believes it.|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	What are the qualifications of "the man who made the weather channel" to make such a claim for you to agree with him?  Do you trust his climate expertise simply because of his business track record?  Come to think about it his business track record isn't that great either.  He's now a TV weather reporter in San Diego.|`|JmSHwiEFaa	Global warming is real, as you said in your explanation.    You're halfway correct about the flooding.  Melting of the floating polar ice cap will not contribute even a millimeter to the sea level.  However, melting glaciers and continental ice sheets will contribute.  This ice is currently on land and will melt into the oceans.  The other major contributor is thermal expansion.  When we warm something up, it expands!  Increased Ocean temperatures makes the water increase in volume, which will contribute to sea level rise.    EDIT: Sorry midnite... ice floats because it is less dense than the water.  When the ice melts it becomes more dense and takes less volume... by the exact ratio of ice out of the water to ice in the water when it was an ice berg or cap.  Net effect, no rise in sea level.  Experiment yourself with a glass of water with an ice cube in it.    EDIT: So the scientists who believe that continental crust is rebounding from the last ice age are trustworthy but nobody else?|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	You really didn't think this through - did you?    Ice floats in "salt" water - like the ocean. Haven't you heard of icebergs? If the ice rises up out of the water it is like a sandcastle in a sandbox. If you flatten that sandcastle, the level of sand surrounding it rises. If the ice melts the sea rises.     On the other hand, I believe that global warming is real. As real as the Easter Bunny,  George Bush's military service, and the Pope's Sex club membership.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	1) I don't care what a TV weatherman thinks about global warming.  I care what the experts think.  97% of scientists actively researching climate science (something John Coleman has never done) agree that the planet is warming and humans are largely responsible.  http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Dor...    2) Here is the sunspot data from the Stanford Solar Center.  Take a look at it and tell me if you still think the Sun has caused the recent global warming.  http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...    3) Sea level rise is caused by two factors: melting *land-based* ice (not sea ice), and the thermal expansion of the oceans (as it gets hotter, water expands).|`|53VgQm9Caa	So how do you explain the fact that according to all the indexes, the amount of heat from the sun has been level for about 40 years, while over the same period the planet has gotten hotter?      http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...  http://www.mps.mpg.de/images/projekte/su...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Climat...  http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi...    And you're quite correct that if sea ice melts, it behaves exactly like ice in a glass of water.     If glaciers, ice caps, and permafrost melt into the sea however, it's like adding extra ice cubes.|`|EKFyplGjaa	Climate change is happening-their is no doubt in my mind.  But to say we as a species are changing the nature of a PLANET is absurd. People give humans way to much credit. Yes, we are having a negative impact on the Earth in how we abuse our nonrenewable resources. However Climate Change is something that has been occuring for million-possibly billions of years. We are simply going through the cycle once again.
AA10498232	The glaciers that planed the land from Michigan to southern Indiana melted long before man started burning anything but a few sticks to keep warm. It 's a natural cycle of the earth. Al Gore if a dork!|`|oWYevEPtaa	Yes, Global Warming is real.  The Earth goes through periods of hot and cold.  When there was an Ice Age, you could say that was a "global cooling."    Even if there were not humans on Earth, the Earth would still be getting warmer this decade. HOWEVER. The fact that we have all of this pollution and greenhouse gases warms the Earth more than it would naturally.    So yes, Global Warming is real...But the Earth would warm regardless of human activity..just not as much.|`|4qUVll5Yaa	DUH!|`|dubuFbxuaa	Nope, and i agree with you - it is a huge scam, and the reason it's gained so much attention is because the media feels they need to go along with it (if they don't, they'd better watch out!). scientists too are scared of going against the theory. so people hear it over and over again and eventually they begin to be brainwashed, and suddenly almost everybody believes in doomsday.    We are not causing it! the earth always goes through climate cycles for many reasons, ex. the sun, volcanoes, etc. Climate is sooo complicated, it's nearly impossible for one unproven factor (greenhouse theory) to cause it. and i agree 100%, the whole 'rising sea levels' is a lie created by Al Gore himself. I could go on and on but hopefully you understand that yes, i am the dreaded 'climate change denier'! (but as far as i'm concerned that's a good thing!)|`|PqUXnWZGaa	Obviously Global Warming is real, it was 109 degrees in Australia just the other day! And its all because of Global Warming being affected by humans, nuclear plants, coal, factories, etc... Where do u think all that pollution goes, into space???|`|T94hMGajaa	wow you r the one person i know that beleavs the same i do hahahah|`|GWzoQ0iaaa	That is true but you cant ignore all the time and effort some of the best minds in the world are putting into the effort to stop it. I believe it is real but not for sure i question it. the reason why its brought up so much is because it is a fact that as a race we have been irresponsible, and we need to make changes. just because you dont believe in it doesnt mean you shouldnt do your part in making this a better planet
yyQaxfaMaa	Yes, its a good idea to listen to your local radio in the morning, they will update you|`|8EsicBxUaa	Why cant you search yahoo because this question has been asked on about 39 occasions....       Phone your school tomorrow morning and find out :)|`|pzZW3coraa	I went onto the brmb website and they show you a whole list.. but yes you probably will be :D ENJOY !! i know i will ! xx
oKFAt7Lsaa	Its a limit set by the government that restricts the amount , size and type of fish that is legally allowed to be caught by fishermen, or countries.|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	The amount of various species of fish that fishermen can fish from particular areas. I think this is in place so they do not over fish and therefore deplete the supply.
zTT3MZk8aa	Yeah, he saw his shadow unfortunately.......Well they did a survey and it is actually 34% true that we will have 6 more weeks of winter. I hate the winter too!|`|pcJ6EGwkaa	Pfft not in cali. Could have worn shorts and a t-shirt at 6 am if i wanted to|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Phil and Pete did. Beauregard did not. I gather that PA will be cold longer than Alabama will. Aren't groundhogs informative?|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Spring does not officially start for 6 weeks no matter what some ground rat says- look at a calendar.
