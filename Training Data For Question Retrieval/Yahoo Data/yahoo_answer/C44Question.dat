At the time I plugged these numbers into a spread sheet, the National Debt is at $10,814,02,391,983.9      Currently the US population stands at 305,699,370 people.  Current Debt load is $35,377.58      The median income is about $48,201      Potential tax needed to cover National Debt: about 73%      This doesn't look hopeful.  Do you think the government will really ever raise taxes this hight?  Would you be willing to pay?

Please read this before answering, because this question is not just about Ron Paul:      From the pro Obama website:  "We must make the internet more "Obama" friendly, there are a whole bunch of conservatard sites that criticize our president. I have been assured by Sec of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano that she will take steps to make the internet more friendly but she needs sites that should be banned. Websites that must be banned! "       http://www.theobamaforum.com/showthread....       Are these people for real?

I'm getting ready to get my first personally owned handgun, and after firing the Glock 17 I'm thinkig of getting it. I'd be using it for target shooting, as well as using it if I go into law enforcement.       I fired 50 rounds through it. I had 6 casing jams (the guy at the range said the gun was dirty and that's why the casings didn't eject correctly)      I had 4 double feed jams (probably because I'm not used to shooting yet and I have "limp wrist".  Tips to stop that is appreciated as well)      All shots were within the target, most being in the X-9pt. area, at 25 feet. I have yet to try it further out, mostly because time at the range is limited to about an hour a week and I was just getting used to the weapon.      The gun had a nice weight when loaded and the hand feel was decent. It's not a very "pretty" gun, but who buys a gun for it's looks?       So what do you think? Is it a good investment? The one I'm considering is $629.

Everyone needs to work together to make it function.      I don't have people coming to my door begging me to work for their company. It's hard to get a job. It's beyond hard to get a job that pays a living wage. I have a job, but sometimes, I don't work some days, so it's difficult.      I hear a lot of these bozos telling people to "help themselves" and "get a job." I think a lot of these people got a job from daddy or have a trust fund. Either that, or they don't remember how they got to where they are in life. Simon Cowell basically admitted in his book that he was a bum, but that his father got him a job at a music company. Tom Brokaw essentially was too.      I can't tell you how many people, not just Republicans, walk around in fantasy land acting like there are scores of jobs out there. "You have a college degree? You should be working in a University or high-tech lab somewhere, maybe even for a Congressman!"      I even get bitches that work at Applebee's or grocery stores telling me this.

The first question the lady asked was "are you employed?" I replied "well yes." She said there is a waiting list for "employed parents." I am just wondering - why do unemployed parents get priority over employed parents? I know they probably need to look for a job, OR lay on the couch while their kids are being care for free of charge. etc...

We were running massive budget deficits even during good economic times.   We just cannot afford it anymore, because we need to start focusing on our infrastructure and working on the home front.      Not to mention - we have no real military threats.  As we've seen in Iraq, there are limits to the power of the military force.     Our military didn't stop the 9/11 hijackers....but it indirectly caused it (since the attackers were opposed to the US military forces located in Saudi Arabia).      Justified wars - like Afghanistan - result in coalitions.    Why can't we just rely on treaties and working with allies more, going forward?       Finally, the biggest war the USA was involved in - World War II - was not won through a massive standing military.   It was won because we had the domestic manufacturing base to build that huge force AS NEEDED.

Please look at the picture before you read and answer:       http://www.emilyslist.org/images/poster_...          Do you find anything "Politically Incorrect" or "Racist" about this poster, or does it just prove that Dem/Libs are hyper sensitive and look into things way too much?      ************   I was at a friends house this past weekend and they had one hanging on their fridge- I didnt think anything of it until one of them said how 'wrong' it was to have Obama's picture on the "N"............. I laughed.      Is it going to be that way for the next 4 years- Libs just being rediculous and making a big deal out of nothing and using the word "racist" far too often?    EXAMPLE: The Chimp Cartoon, voting republican, against Obama in general.

The checks total $51, yes I said $51.  With fines and court costs she has to pay a total of $304 to clear both checks.  She moved to another county after getting bonded out to be with family and her unemployment checks are in limbo.  Her hearing is wednesday, two days away.  If she doesn't have the fines paid prior to court what will happen?  Will they make payment arrangements with her or throw her in jail until she pays?

20090223084242AAThxLM	Politics & Government;Politics	Can you trust colleges and universities anymore?	I was watching an ad on TV the other day. It asked why people were leaving Michigan when there are 90,000 jobs going unfilled everyday.      The ad was by Baker College, a community college in Flint.      Every time I click on a Yahoo news link about jobs, it's from HotJobs or it's an article done in conjunction with an online university.      Who's stupid enough to believe these people? There are two things I've learned in life: 1. Don't go to school unless you're sure your employment is guaranteed after graduation or your employer is paying for it and 2. Salesmen are always commissioned to sell crap no one wants to buy.      I like community colleges, I went to a big university and went to community college in the summer. I learned more there, while at the bigger universities, I was taught by uninterested TA's that were not there to ensure that we learned anything, but just to talk...about garbage. Essentially, adult day care.      I stopped listening to colleges a long time ago. You should have seen the money my university spent on construction and technology. It would have made people in Dubai flustered.

20090223083253AAC7c01	Politics & Government;Military	What do you think about this deserter?	 http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2...       To summarize it up, she joined the Army in 1998 as a mother of two coming off of a failing marriage and went AWOL during AIT because one of her kids got sick and the Army wouldn't let her bring her kids back to her base with her after her emergency leave was over.  Ten years later and after only two attempts to turn herself in to Naval bases she gets arrested.      What amazes me is that over half of the reader's comments on the page support her and say she should get away with it scott-free, with one person going as far as saying she should get back pay for the ten years she was a deserter.      In my opinion, she deserves what is coming to her because she went AWOL instead of doing the right thing.  There were plenty of resources available for her and her kids at this time.  Her sick kid was being treated at a military hospital on a Navy base at the time as well.  Going AWOL wasn't necessary in my opinion but what do you think?

Bush spent a lot of money and did not seem to have the traditional philosophy of fiscal conservatism. Why was it okay for Bush to spend all this money but not Obama? My friends tell me that it was okay because Bush spent all that cash to defend the country. But Obama is doing it for a good reason as well: to get us out of this recession. I AM NOT TRYING TO BE POLITICAL HERE. I just want to know. Why did Bush get a pass from conservatives for spending tremendously but Obama doesn't?

My husband has been active duty in the Army since October.  Ever since we arrived at his duty station he has been depressed and has said that Army life is not for him.  He started doing drugs  and ended up failing 3 drug tests.  He had been given 45 days extra duty, loss of rank and pay and they told him that he was going to get discharged from the military.  Then I found out I had a miscarriage and we both really took it hard.  He has lost all motivation and last night he said he could  not take being here any longer and admitted himself into a mental health facility.  We have been together since 2001, and I have never seen any signs of depression, or drug use prior to arriving here.  I love him with all my heart but need advice on what to expect.  I really am un familiar with everything about the military ( I've only been here a few months) and the center he checked himself into isn't on base, it's just approved by tricare.  I am scared for him, and wonder what this facility that he went to is like, and if he will be able to check himself out.  I have tried calling the facility and they won't give me any information.  They said a case worker would contact me and couldn't give me a timeline.  I'm sorry if I'm babbling, I just need to hear some advice.

My 18 yr old cousin should be recieving money at 19 yrs old this year that was left to her from a neglect settlement and death of her mother. She used to live with my mom but my aunts/uncles have been fighting for my cousin every since they knew that this money was involved and my cousin accused my step dad of a few sexual harrassment events. I know that this is true because he did me the same way for over 10 years while in the home.Now she lives with my aunt but my mom still serves as the legal guardian. My aunts/uncles are taking my mom to court again to remove her name from the estate. The first time they took her and my step dad to court to have him put in jail for sexual harrasment. That didn't work. Can they remove my mom's name ? My mom hasn't messed with the money and my aunt and her husband basicly wants it for themselves and their family. My cousin has lived with them for about 9 months. And my mother has been taking care of her every since her mother died about 10 yrs ago. My mom loves my cousin like a daughter and she was always there for her before my aunt became involved or the money was involved. They were never really there.    Can they change the estate for real? If they do the money will not go to my cousin and she will have to try to live after all this which will be almost impossible because of all of the emotional trauma she's experienced.,

IMO, we were just stuck in limbo before Obama got into office.   Yeah, Bush signed his TARP funding that Paulson 'distributed' to Wall Street.   But, outside of that, Bush vehemently proclaimed almost to the end that everything was going fine. Meanwhile, things kept going downhill without any action.      So, why is doing nothing better than what Obama is trying to do?   Don't say "running up debt" because Bush did the same thing. The difference was that he didn't have to ask for bailout funds since he was already working with a surplus.      Thoughts?

20090223095305AAaDstG	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Has Obama done in 31 days what no enemy, foreign or domestic has been able to do?	That is.   Destroy America      everything that makes America great is under assualt while he panders to the under achieving, under motivated left.      Taking money from those people who are motivated to make this country work and giving ito to the laziest, most foolish or selfish of us, is a sure fire way to kill this country.      Why seek to excel, if your country is only going to punish you in favor of the  hamburger flippers.      This life is what YOU make it. If you aren't succeeding then it is because of a choice you made, or didn't make in your life.   I am not perfect, and I am not rich, but I am trying...trying to succeed, trying to excel, and now if I do all my efforts will be used to drag those people who refuse to.      Socialism has killed every country it has ever touched, and now Obama is bringing it here.         Good job sparky.  You are going to bring fruition to Abraham Lincolns words :      January 27, 1838      At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth in their military chests; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in the trial of a thousand years.      At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.

20090223090404AApItaZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should she have to pay?	I'm gonna give a little backstory to this so it all makes sense.      I was in a car accident in August of 2007. There were 5 people in the car at that time. It was me, 3 of my friends, and a friend of one of my friends. The friend of a friend was the one that was driving. My case with my lawyer is already done and closed, and in the process of all of that I came to find out that the driver had died. We don't know how or any of the details.       My friend is being sued for $8000 from the hospital because she hasn't paid her medical bills. A claims examiner from Geico said that the only way they would pay her medical bills was if she could provide her car insurance information and/or proof of address. Her car insurance had lapsed at that time. She couldn't provide proof of address because she had just moved in with me and another friend that was in the accident. They said they could accept her previous proof of address because that wasn't where she was living at the time of the accident. They said they needed something pretty much in a month window (two weeks before the accident and two weeks after). She moved in the week before the accident, and I was in the hospital for a week, and she was with me the whole time. After I came home, she was helping me around the house, and we didn't have a computer or a car with insurance at that time so she was unable to get her mailing address changed right away.       Should she have to pay the medical bills. The accident was not her fault. With the driver being deceased, is it possible for her to go after his parents. He was 23 at the time of the accident, living by himself in Delaware (where we live and where the accident occurred). He moved back in with his parents (who lived in New Jersey) after the accident (which the car had New Jersey car insurance).       Any help is greatly appreciated. My friend is very scared, and doesn't have that kind of money. Thank you very much.

And I don't want to seem whiny, but do I really have to wear those horrible Army-issue glasses?  I can't get away w/o wearing glasses or contacts because, without corrective aids, my sight is extremely poor.  I.e., absolutely no driving, reading, NOTHING.  Would I be allowed to wear my civilian glasses?  They aren't flamboyantly colored or oddly shaped--just plain black plastic in a rounded/rectangular shape.  Or perhaps wear my contacts?    but if I do have to wear them, are the Army glasses any smaller these days than they used to be?  and do you get different frame choices?  And after Basic, when I do my weekends and 2-weeks-a-year in the Guard, would I have to wear the Army glasses for those?   And really, does wearing glasses make Basic any  harder than those who don't have to?  I really hate to wear glasses, I much prefer contacts when I'm working out or working outside.  It seems like the glasses in Basic would get all scratched and dirty and slide down your nose from all the sweat and stuff.  if anybody has gone through Basic with glasses, I'd appreciate hearing about your experience.   I really appreciate any answers/advice you guys can give me.  I won't let such a stupid thing like glasses define whether I serve my country, but I do want to get all the details.  I will probably end up serving, but I want to get all possible info first.  Thank you!   If you are a past, present, or future Armed Service member, I thank you very much for serving us.

20090223090043AAcLyh8	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does it seem that some people hold up the poor as some type of honorable thing?	I grew up poor in Detroit Michigan.  Left an abusive home at the age of 15.  Left school after the 10th grade.  Spent 2 1/2 years on the streets.  Joined the Navy at 17 and was honorably discharged at 21 in 1993 and went back to Detroit.  In 1994 I made a grand total of $12,000 for the year.  I left Detroit and today I own two small businesses and am doing very well.  What I learned along the way is I was poor until such a time as I quit being a victim and began making good choices.  When I was poor I valued being able to have long hair and wear grubby clothes...when I cut my hair and began wearing a suit...my "Luck" changed dramatically.      From experience I can tell you that the vast majority REMAIN poor as adults are that way due to their own poor decision making and victim mentality.  So why do people treat them as if there is honor in it?

20090223092524AADji74	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How far back can you file a discrimination suit against your employeer?	Last august another coworker and I were involved in a harassment situation. He (by the way he was also in the spot of 'Lead Man' which meant that he ran the team that I was working on). He had gone through my things when I had gone to the bathroom and looked at my paycheck. Payroll had made an error and paid me for an extra hour for my holiday pay. I hadn't even noticed it. Anyway, long story short, he started harassing me, making me do more work than the other guys (I was the only female that works in the foundry in this division, by the way.), telling the guys not to help me, complaining that I was not fast or good enough to my face, making me do things by myself that require additional help, etc. You get the point. Well, it came to HR and our supervisor and I had even gone to one of the head people of the company. Their resolution was to demote me and him. He took over my position, and I was sent to the sorting belt. I still feel like I was the one that was wronged, and I would like to know if there is anything that I can do about it now. Thanks. Also if it matters, I live in the state of Wisconsin. And I never signed anything regarding the situation.

20090223091321AAnHqbX	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do you vote for Democrats?	Why I voted Democrat       I voted Democrat because I love the fact that I can now   marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my horse.       I voted Democrat because I believe oil companies'   profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene but the   government taxing the same gallon of gas at 15% isn't.       I voted Democrat because I believe the government will do a   better job of spending the money I earn than I would.       I voted Democrat because freedom of speech is fine as long   as nobody is offended by it.       I voted Democrat because when we pull out of Iraq I trust   that the bad guys will stop what they're doing because   they now think we're good people.       I voted Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to   own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to   protect me from murderers and thieves.       I voted Democrat because I believe that people who   can't tell us if it will rain on Friday can tell us that   the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I   don't start driving a Prius.       I voted Democrat because I'm not concerned about the   slaughter of millions of babies so long as we keep all death   row inmates alive.       I voted Democrat because I believe that business should not   be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to   break even and give the rest away to the government for   redistribution as THEY see fit.       I voted Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to   rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit some fringe   kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.       I voted Democrat because my head is so firmly planted up my   rectum that it is unlikely that I'll ever have another   point of view, other than the crappy one I have now.

We also have a child together.  He was paying on and off when he was able to.  He hasn't been working consistently for those 9 years. They intercepted his tax returns in the past but it seems he can never get this amount down. He's starting to pay the current $300 (it used to be more) per month but how can he ever pay down the arrears with his income and supporting another family? Plus, they charge interest as well.  Any ideas on what he can do? I have a great job now.  Do you think I should help him pay? He hasn't asked me or anything.      Another question is, it's very difficult for him to see his child.  Whenever he calls his ex to see his child on the weekend there's always something they have to do like go to a birthday party or something.  I told my bf that he needs to make an arrangement with his ex to see his child every other weekend, some holidays, summers, etc.  He only sees her at the most 5 times a year! I feel he has a right to see his daughter more. His ex is remarried and has a new family and my bf daughter considers her husband as her dad.

20090223095753AAOA6rB	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did Americans let FDR steal their gold via Executive Order 6102?	Executive Order 6102 is an Executive Order signed on April 5, 1933 by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt "forbidding the Hoarding of Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates." It required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933 all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve. Under the Trading With the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, as amended on March 9, 1933, violation of Executive Order 6102 was punishable by fine up to $10,000 ($166,640 if adjusted for inflation as of 2008) or up to ten years in prison, or both. Because of this forced immediate sale of gold to the Federal Reserve at the government set price of $20.67 per troy ounce, this Executive Order is often referred to as the Gold Confiscation of 1933. ****Shortly after this forced sale, the price of gold from the treasury for international transactions was raised to $35 an ounce; the U.S. government thereby devalued the U.S. dollar by 41%.***       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_O...

20090223085838AAOA7Zk	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the Republican belief that tax cuts will equal jobs flawed?	Here's some simple math: Cut taxes for Republicans, and you will expect them to create jobs, right?      That's if you assume these people are decent. If they can function with the taxes in place already, why can't they just pocket the money from the tax breaks? Why wouldn't they just pay off some of their existing debt?      Maybe this is the key vulnerability in the Republican thought process. As one person that converted from the Republican Party told me, he assumed people were naturally decent, but that he was wrong. He was right.      If I am one business owner, I cannot do anything to change the economy. I WILL pocket the money, because my business will have trouble because of the economy. The government can tax me however, and influence the economy much more effectively than I can. By proving that I have provided jobs, that should ensure that I get a tax break. It's either that or the government will have to tax me and other business owners and provide those jobs somehow, getting more customers through my doors.      I'm going to have some balls and say this; Republicans don't understand how an economy works, plain and simple.       Now, there are bad Democrats out there. Jennifer Granholm is one of the worst, most clueless ones. However, I don't understand the hate towards Obama, he knows what he's doing. Tax cuts for the rich, as he has said, have been done for the past 8 years; it didn't work. It just gives more money to the people that shouldn't get any more to begin with, making more people poor.      Why can't you people understand this? Every economy needs socialism to survive. Expunge your ingrained hatred of socialism, it is a variable that the economy needs to survive.       It's like coolant for your car.

They've been getting away with a lot because of the Republican administration. However, they're not stupid.       Poor Republicans aren't smart. What, John Thain got $300 million a few years ago? My god, do you think he would feel under-compensated if he only got $50 million? Jesus. Why should this guy get paid $300 million as fair compensation? Why should Bill Gates have $45 billion, or even more now, I think? Is that fair compensation?      What, he's going to leave the country and GO WHERE? Europe, where they probably would tax him even more? Costa Rica? Honduras? Sure, he could do that, but how long will they get away with that? What if we refused to allow their products to get sold here or split their company up, which is more common?      I love how they think when business owners get tax cuts, they hire more people. That's hilarious.

He has made false claims saying my husband is a pervert and trying to touch our daughter. I have witnesed each of the incences he is comlaining about and there was NOTHING  wrong with what he did. Showing affection to your stepchild isn't perversion. CPS didn't find anything wrong either. And since  he didn't like the answer they gave him he files a PPO.   We of course file for a show cause hearing. The judge di not know why this case was in his coutroom and refered it to FOC. Telling my husband to stay away from her until FOC makes a decision. Apparently in his hurry to retire the judge over looked something.    The PPO was left in effect.The day before we are to appear at FOC for our hearing w/ the reffaree, a cop shows up saying that the PPO was violated because my husband has guns in the house.( reported just hours ago by my ex)   These guns were under lock and key and had we known that the ppo was still in effect,they would not have been there. And I took them out to my cousin's right away. Because we were genuinly confused and the cop was as well, he did not arrest my husband.   NOW my ex is PO'd because the prosecuting attorny has not filed against us, so he takes things into his own hands and files a PPO violation against us.     The oder to appear in court statesthe violation happened in Jan 2008 but there was no PPO in effect in Jan2008 ( but Jan 2009) Also we were told by a friend and an attorny that since the guns were locked up and the key was put away,he was not in possession of them .   We need a copy of the police report, but for some reason it is still open and we cant get it.   How did my ex get a copy?

So of course all fingers pointed to me even though i had an alibi. I went to court and charges were dropped but they also said i had to take a lie detector test along with my younger sister and her friend. They then said charges will be filed again in the result of the test. Well my father refused to allow my younger sister take and so i didnt either. Now they are trying to harass me saying i can go to jail unless i take the test but they arent saying a word to my younger sister. I want no part in any of it and im just trying to move on with my life.  My question is are they allowed to put me in jail if i refuse to take the stupid test? The cops around here are really shady and many have been kicked off the force before? Someone with knowledge in law please answer only!!

20090223100256AAmGi9s	Politics & Government;Elections	Will the republicans rush out and purchase Sarah Palin's unauthorized biography?	ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A new unauthorized biography of Gov. Sarah Palin written by a People magazine editor hit bookstores Tuesday, drawing quick criticism from a Palin spokeswoman who said it can’t be trusted and that Palin wants to write a book of her own.      The governor has hired a Washington lawyer who brokered book deals for President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton to work with publishers, said the spokeswoman, Meghan Stapleton. Publishers have been approaching the governor about a book since the campaign, she said.      But first comes "Trailblazer: An Intimate Biography of Sarah Palin," written by Lorenzo Benet, an assistant editor at People.      Benet says he interviewed the governor’s parents, sister and old friends to explore Palin’s personal life, from her pre-politics days in Wasilla to pregnancy in office. The story recounts her underdog run for governor and her explosive bid for the vice presidency, though political junkies searching for bombshells may instead find an emphasis on things like Palin’s tastes and relationships.

The ex has sine gotten married to a paralegal, and they are taking my cousin to court using her dad/boss as their attorney. I guess there was a past due amount of about $1700.00 that they paid so it wouldn't reflect on their credit, but they are suing for over $3000.00.    I am close with the ex and his wife, I understand that he is in a cruddy situation-but he knew what he was doing when he cosigned the loan.

My husband has been laid off since the week before Christmas.  He's been looking for a job, even at the grocery store. Should I write a letter and thank my wonderful Gov. Haley Barbour for being smart enough to turn down money because it might force taxes to be raised on businesses that lay off people when they don't make the huge profit they were making before?  My husband worked in an oilfield that is in no way suffering because of the economy. Their entire rig was laid off. Should we just be happy that I'm still employed and thank him for looking out for big business?        I guess we should just sell our house, which we could afford easily before this, and adjust our living to the $200.00 that he receives from his unemployment benefits until he finds decent employment or his job calls him back.

First and foremost, after World War II, we had a monopoly of the world economy because we were one of the few countries left undamaged.      We also have a lot of natural resources that haven't been tapped because of how young our nation is.      Recently though, our economy has projected an illusion of wealth. Ever been to another country? The stores close really early, you rarely see the amount of advertising and fliers, and there really aren't as many stores around.      Even in little American towns, there are all sorts of crazy businesses and franchises around. Look at what's happening now, scores of them are shutting down or slashing their hours. 24 hour Rite Aids are now opening 7-11 AM.      The reason is that America has been flush with fake money from credit card companies, home equity and mortgage firms. It was all fake! America doesn't make anything anymore! All the rich people that own companies make their products overseas and keep the money! America is economically stagnant!      The market correction is here!

20090223103218AAbVE7J	Politics & Government;Elections	Should the governors who refused the bailout money be impeached?	Why are these governors saying no to the bailout money when they NEED it? For example, the Governor of Louisiana said that his state does need the money. When the homeless is still high, their in a deficit, and their welfare program is outrageous. Alaska, Palin said she didn't need the money when the current oil prices are KILLING Alaska's economy. They need the money yet for some strange reason they don't want to accept it. Claiming that "I feel like our state don't need it" Rather, they just relying on their personal thoughts they should ask for the thoughts and concerns of the people they're supposed to be representing.      This is pure party politics! These Governors are more considered about impressing their Republicans buddies than about impressing and caring about the citizens THEY'RE supposed to be representing.       America, you should be getting sick of party politics, Democrat this and Republican that. Most of these corrupt politicians don't even care about you. They are suppose to be taking care of all the Americans in this country, not just their party friends.       Do you feel that these governors should be impeached and that the  government need to reorder their priorities?
20090223103145AAC8L1y	Politics & Government;Government	America's true colors? They help the troops they send to be killed, wounded and then toss them on the street?	FORT BLISS, Texas – As soldiers stream home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the biggest charity inside the U.S. military has been stockpiling tens of millions of dollars meant to help put returning fighters back on their feet, an Associated Press investigation shows.      Between 2003 and 2007 — as many military families dealt with long war deployments and increased numbers of home foreclosures — Army Emergency Relief grew into a $345 million behemoth. During those years, the charity packed away $117 million into its own reserves while spending just $64 million on direct aid, according to an AP analysis of its tax records.      Meanwhile, civilian charities for service members and veterans say they are swamped by the desperate needs of recent years, with requests far outstripping ability to respond.      According to 2007 U.S. Census Bureau figures, 1.3 million veterans — or 6 percent — lived in poverty, with 537,000 unemployed.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/army_s_stingy...

20090223104709AAea1Q9	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What is a typical sentence for a vehicular manslaughter?	I know this kid in my town who, back in summer 2007, was involved in an accident in which the passenger of the car he was driving was killed. This kid I know driving was 18 years old at the time, was was legally intoxicated with a BAC of 0.20. He also had 7 passengers in the car where there was only 5 places in the car, he was speeding and swurving and caused significant property damage, and there was speculation he was also on drugs. Like I said, the passenger in his car, a 15 year old, was killed, and 2 of the other 4 passengers were seriously injured. The bail was $150,000 dollars, but so far he has managed to put off the trial for some time (i think the excuse was that he is in college) and only has his lost his license. He has also exhibited violent behavior at times before and after (he was kicked out of his college dorm room for a semester because of fighting with the RA). Is he likely to serve jail time, or will he get off easy. This accident occured in New Jersey.

20090223112353AAYH7L6	Politics & Government;Elections	What thoughts would come to your mind if you saw this sign "One Nation under Obama"?	"Heine has a new battle to fight if he wants to keep the sign on display. Pinellas County code enforcement says the fence he put up around the sign is one foot too high. He's also been slapped with another violation. County code allows only one freestanding sign per business. Because of that, officials say the sign must come down."      Randy plans to fight that decision. "The only way I would consider taking down the sign is if President Obama asked me to. Otherwise, it will stay."          http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/ob...

"MOSCOW -- For a decade, Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting the U.S. will fall apart in 2010. For most of that time, he admits, few took his argument -- that an economic and moral collapse will trigger a civil war and the eventual breakup of the U.S. -- very seriously. Now he's found an eager audience: Russian state media."       http://www.babelup.com/blog-entry/left-w...

20090223112040AAxqoFu	Politics & Government;Politics	Can someone find the exact quote where Jeb Bush claims to be a "self-made man"?	It's supposed to be in Malcolm Gladwell's "Outliers: The Story Of Success" but I don't have this book and I'm too lazy to go to the library:      "[Jeb] Bush claims that his success is only the result of "his own pluck and work ethic" and that he was actually at a "disadvantage" having a grandfather who was a senator and a father who was president!"       http://www.anamericanstudies.com/2008/12...       "It was fun reading about Jeb Bush insisting that he is a self-made man, that he got ahead by his own individual pluck and determination. This from a man born to a United States president, brother to another, and grandson to a senator and wealthy Wall Street banker. Gladwell points out that this is "thinking that cannot be described as anything other than delusional." "       http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TZ2B8K42...

20090223111654AA2lN43	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are people blaming Bush for the economy?	Why are people blaming Bush (And some people are even blaming Clinton, which is just beyond stupid) Just because it happened during his terms doesn't mean it's his fault. Yes, he was a bad president, but for other reasons. Bush deregulated many things, which allowed Banks to venture further. However, a few banks became too greedy and start handing out loans to everyone, regardless of their credit and even often knowing that the person wouldn't be able to pay them back which ended in mass foreclosures. (Auto industry has nothing to do with this and is simply about American car companies have been unable to produce a car that people want to buy for about 30 years)      It's like one guy giving a homeless man a few hundreds dollars for food and shelter, but instead that homeless man goes and buys a gun, then robs a convenience store, shoots the clerk and runs away.      Now you know.

Under the Bush administration, we fell 1.2 trillion in debt. In one month the Obama administration has added another 800 BILLION of debt to an already incomprehensible number. For eight years I put up with this "Bush stole the election," nonsense. For the next 4 years at least, I get to look forward to this "Obama is a socialist," nonsense. Both parties are socialist. Both parties want to wage war, just different countries. Both parties grow the government, neither party cares about the national debt. Both parties hand out welfare checks, Dems to the poor, Pubs to the corporations. Under Bush, 13 banks gave preferred stock to the government. Under Obama, citigroup is now %40 controlled by the government.Both parties are quite guilty in this current recession.      We have a social security ponzi scheme that is already broke. Medicaid and medicare are almost in the red. And now, let's start a nationalized healthcare system. Where's the money going to come from?      The two sides are playing us off of each other. Or am I wrong?
