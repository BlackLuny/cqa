20090205004308AALnfcJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	What do you do when your computer needs more RAM installed but it won't be covered under extended warranty?	In late 2007, I bought a lap top using Vista, with 1 GB (2 x 512 MB RAM sticks installed) of DDR 2 667MHZ.      I only really use the lap top for general internet use, and word processing/printing.      Even though Vista uses (takes up) at least 512 MB of RAM, I have been told that despite non intensive use of my lap top (graphics, games, downloading video/s and audio) that computers using Vista, needs at least 2 GB of RAM to operate and run smoothly/well/optimumly.      The Manufactuers Warranty (Hewlett Packard) that went for 1 year, expired in late December 2008, and it is now under a 1 year extended warranty done by Clive Peeters and Lumley (An Insurance Company)   I have been told that if I add (install) any other RAM (different to the original supplied by the manufacturer, that I will not be covered if (say new RAM I buy, causes something bad to happen to the computer)      Is there any way I can get around this?      I don't know that you can find or buy approved Hewlett Packard RAM from anywhere/Australian retailers, and even if you could, it would be much more expensive such as $ 119 AUD for 1 GB of RAM,   rather than buying any other/alternative/cheaper brand of RAM from anywhere.      If I install the new/additional RAM myself, that would void the extended warranty too would't it?      Even if something did go wrong with the computer with new/changed RAM in it, and turned off/unplugged the lap-top and replaced the New RAM with the original RAM supplied by HP, the company/companies who I bought the extended warranty from, would still somehow tell that a technical problem wouldn't be caused the originally supplied RAM (by HP) would they?      What cheaper sticks of RAM are good and reputable for HP lap tops/notebooks, and which brands of RAM which I steer clear of?   I heard Zeppelin is a bad brand.

I don't even use the wireless internet for it.  I have one ethernet from the wall into the router, another ethernet cord from the router into the Xbox, and finally a third ethernet cord from the router to my Macbook.  I called Belkin and they couldn't help, and I tried looking all over the internet and cant follow anything cause they all use terms that i don't understand.  I'm just wondering if anyone can help me change the NAT from Strict to Open.  Please Help!!!

I got it working but I had to enable MAC Address Clone then Release/Renew in the router page. I don't remember if the MAC thing has always been enabled and since I reseted to factory defaults I can't check.      Is it possible for a router to have Mac Address Clone disabled and work properly? Or did I just never notice. And is there anyway my ISP can trace who I am with that MAC Address?

THIS COULD BE CAUSED BY AN INVALID VALUE FOR THE 'SERVICE NAME' FIELD FOR THIS CONNECTION. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR ISP  AND INQUIRE ABOUT THE VALUE FOR THIS FIELD AND UPDATE IT IN THE CONNECTION PROPERTIES      This has annoyed me no end due to the fact that these things have got a really good rating for being simple to setup and i thought it would be easy. Could someone let me know if they know how to sort this out with step by step instructions as am not very good at this sort of thing. Am on vista premium and any help would be appreciated.      thanks.

20090204215844AAdr3jx	Computers & Internet;Software	Can I have Windows XP and Windows Vista on the same computer?	I have a professional thermal disc printer but it won't work on Windows Vista.  The company hasn't come out with printer drivers for Vista yet. I can get it to print once and then the Subsystem Spooler App stops working and I have to restart the computer to print again, but this doesn't happen with XP, so, since I only have one desktop at home and primarily use this machine at home, I was wondering how I could go about having XP and Vista on the same computer.  Should I just buy a second internal hard drive and install XP on it with the print drivers and whatever other programs I need and then just boot that drive when I need to use the printer?  Or is there another way to go?  I'm computer knowledgeable but not a pro so keep it simple for me.

20090204221242AApVRPl	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How Should I Determine A Price For Developing A Web Site?	Okay, so a local car body shop owner is aware that I have a lot of knowledge with computer programming in general, and that I also develop web sites. He would like to pay me to develop a small web site for his shop.      What factors should I consider when naming a price? I know no one can tell you a set amount. And that I need to factor in what I feel my time and effort are worth, as well as what I feel the quality of my work is worth.      One thing that will drop the price is the fact that I've never worked with a business setting. I've done some personal web sites for friends and family, but that's about it. I know I'm perfectly capable of giving him what he wants based on some specs. he is going to give me.      Oh, and is the industry standard an hourly charge, or a flat fee?

20090204223044AAaleM2	Computers & Internet;Internet;MySpace	MySpace uploader problems..?	Ok so, i've noticed that a couple people have asked this question, but have gotten no real answer.    Every time I try to upload a photo to MySpace, my browser(Mozilla) freezes up. Right when I click the "Upload" link it freezes. I can't even use the old uploader because it freezes before I can get there.   I've updated my Flash because apparently that's what the new uploader uses, but that didn't help at all.   Does anyone know why this is happening and what I could possibly do to fix it?

20090204223555AA2zSPI	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Can somebody please help me get my E8500 stable over 3.8ghz?	Hello, I'm using an ASRock P45xe motherboard, and a E0 stepping e8500. I have it stable at 400 fsb(3.8ghz clock) with these voltages:   vcore = 1.25625   nb core = 1.12   vtt = 1.2      I have sb core set on "low" though I don't know exactly what that equates to. I also have an option called "1.1v sb core" which I dunno what it does, but it's set on low as well.   I think I have gtlref set on .63 X vtt      It seems rock solid at these settings...but I can't seem to nudge it any higher. I'd read so much about these people who's only limit on their E8500s is heat. So I'm banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to get my chip to go higher. At 410 fsb it'll boot into windows, but can't handle even two minutes of Prime95 without getting an error. I've tried increasing each voltage one at a time, till I thought it was as high as is safe...to no avail. And I'd tried changing them all at once, and in different combinations....all of it no no avail. In fact, it feels like increasing my voltages is having adverse affects. Seems to make me error even faster, usually instantly. By the way, I'm running my ram at the factory recommended voltage(2.1v), and I'm actually downclocking it to run 1:1 with my fsb. I seem to be unable to post when not running 1:1.      Is there anything that I can try? Or am I just limited by my hardware? If I am hardware limited, then what is most likely the cause? Is my processor just an unlucky one? Or would it be more likely that my crappy motherboard is the cause? Is there a way that I can test and see? I think I can RMA my processor on the grounds that my temperature sensors are stuck(I hope that's reason enough). And I'm sure I can find an excuse to RMA my motherboard. I'd just like to know which of them is most likely the cause, as I'm already like 11 days into my 30 day return period with newegg, so once shipping and such comes into play, I don't really have a lot of trial and error time to mess with. Thanks for your time and suggestions.      P.S. If I do need a new motherboard, I'm considering the Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3R, as I don't have much money at the moment. Does anybody have experience with this board? Is it good for overclocking?      If it matters, my specs are:   Antec 900   Corsair TX-750 750W power supply   ASRock P45XE Motherboard   Core 2 Duo E8500 with Xigmatek HDT-S1283 for cooling   Corsair Dominator pc8500(ddr2 1033mhz)   EVGA Geforce GTX 295   WD Velociraptor 300gb
20090204223628AAHxEtX	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	How can i fix my webcam?	Alright heres what happend; I went to the store, came back home, and found my apt torn apart by my StBernard puppy. He had gotten my webcam from ontop of the computer and chewed on it. Its still in one piece except for the wire in the back of the cam. I doubt its fixable but its worth asking. Is there anyway to fix the wires so it works again? Even just as a mic. Im pretty sure the whole bunch of tiny silver wires that are broken are fiber optics or something. Yea i know im a noob thats why im asking this question. i DID order a new cam on ebay but they gyped me and took my money without sending me the cam. Real answers only PLEASE.

20090204224529AAfMYSy	Computers & Internet;Internet;Google	Search engine problems?	I have antispyware and antivirus Webroot. I've ran several scans that pick up cookies. I delete them and I still have the same problem, and the search detects no other viruses.      When I use a search engine like google or yahoo something like myspace will come up if you search it, but when you click the link you are re-directed to advertising sites. This happens no matter how many times I run my systems mechanics or Webroot sweeps. I've tried downloading other antispyware free online but always delete it because it's search also never catches whatever is causing these search engine problems. If my antispyware won't work and none that I try work I fail to see how I can fix this problem. I've posed this question to the yahoo community a number of times in the past two weeks with no good answers, I'm hoping this time I might actually get some help.

20090204225422AA5pHEg	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Can touching RAM kill it?	I recently got 2GB of DDR1 400MHz RAM for my computer (motherboard supports DDR1 400MHz, up to 2GB). It's two 1GB sticks. I took out the old RAM (two sticks) and put in the new RAM, after touching the computer case to remove any static buildup. When plugged back in, the computer showed nothing on the monitor. I took out one of the new RAM sticks. Still black screen.      I swapped the new stick with the other new stick. It worked, 1GB of RAM working correctly. Swapped them over again, still no luck with the other. Swapped them back again (with the 1GB that worked) and it doesn't work! I'm afraid that I've killed the RAM.      Is it possible to kill RAM by handling it? I was very careful, only touching the sides, not the contacts or chips. I also removed any excess static by touching the computer case each time.   I also pressed the computer's power button every time I unplugged it, to remove any excess capacitor energy (doing this made the light flash for a second).      HELP! I don't want to lose the $90 of RAM that I have JUST bought! Can you kill it by touching it?

20090204225555AAef4xe	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why is my computer taking so long to start up and why does it freeze when I'm surfing the net?	Does anyone have any idea why my computer is slowing down and freezing?      What's happening is that when I open a window I surf the Internet as I usually do and then everything freezes. I tried closing the window but it doesn't work.   I tried the "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" method but the task manager window just doesn't open up.      I had no choice other than to press the "refresh" button on my hard drive.      When my computer starts, it takes even longer for everything to load. It's been like that for the past three days.      It doesn't load everything and freezes. Since the "Ctrl + Alt +Delete" method didn't work again I pressed the refresh button on the hard drive to start it again. I had to do this several times. It was about an hour before I could finally use the computer as usual again.      I thought it might have been the registry so I used a program I've bought to clean it up but I still have the problem.

20090204230944AAGwrGl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop infected with 3 different types of viruses.  Can it be saved?	I bought a brand new dell over 18 months ago.  It has worked like a dream since the day I brought it home from the rental store.  I bought it at a rent to own store.  The laptop has been paid off for about a year now.  Last month, my husband was on the internet.  The laptop started acting funny.  It would freeze, then play, then freeze.  I went on the internet to check my emails.  A blue screen appeared then the computer shut down.  My anti virus software appeared and said that it found a virus and had quarantined it.  The next night the blue screen appeared and did what it had the night before.  But no message from the software.  In the middle of surfing the internet, the screen froze and another blue screen appeared and the computer shut down again.  I finally took the laptop back to the rental store since I had a warranty on the laptop.  The computer repair tech scanned my laptop and found 3 trojan viruses which had infected the hard drive.  He said he wasn't sure if he could save the hardware or the laptop.  The store manager said she would notify me by Wednesday (today) if they could repair it.  I was given a loaner computer while mine is being repaired.  I like the loaner, but it's a desktop and I'm use to the laptop.  Does anyone know if a computer can be saved once it has been infected by a trojan virus?  I feel like I've lost over $1500 which I paid for the laptop.  The desktop PC is nice but I miss mine.  Thanks for any answers.

I started to notice because i play xbox live and I would get a "disconnected from xbox live" message.  It took a while for me to find out, and this is what i discovered.  My internet connection would drop every night at 11:08 pm.  It would just loose connection in a NANOSECOND, and I can quickly get back online.        It does not affect me when im surfing the web or whatever, but it affects me more when im playing xbox and it drops the connection.  I would be a host in some games and if connection drops, then everything else does.      I find it totally weird that it drops every night at the same exact time.  I have no idea what the problem would be.  Can anyone help me out on this mystery?

I downloaded SpeedFan to see if it was overheating and whatnot, and I showed my friends the results and they said that a fan that size shouldn't be spinning at 6k+ RPM.      My GPU is 60+ degrees    HDD is 50+ degrees   Core temp is always 40+ (It lists 2 Core temps, the other one is always 60+)      Anyway, if anyone has any information on this that could help me it would be great, the top of the case is REALLY HOT, and it's a new computer so I don't want to run the risk of any physical damage to it - would it be as simple as a fan is loose, etc?      Oh, and when the guy plugged it in at the shop it didn't make the noise.. at all. I didn't bump it or anything on the trip home, or when I was setting it up, and it's so loud I can hear it out in the kitchen, over 10m away.         Thanks again.

20090205003116AAGG9qJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Compaq Presario V3000 v3415AU problems wireless XP?	I experienced a few problems when dealing with Windows XP on Compaq Presario V3000 series which is v3415AU type of the laptop. The main problem here is about the wireless which is stated as Broadcom Wireless (on the sticker), but then when we have done installation of the drivers (all of it), nothing match on that wireless driver.       Some of the people are saying that, the usual installation of the drivers are OK except the wireless. So then, each time when we do turned ON the switch of the wireless, the lamp is OK turned ON, but then there's no wireless icon, or something-else related. Evenmore, there's only 2 network icon on the systray, which is LAN and Bluetooth LAN Access. See? Those are very strange on this laptop. Is there anyone could get the solution for this, but not in Vista please.       Thanks a lot.

I would like to take several shots from a movie DVD, convert them into a video file format acceptable to After Effects CS3, bring them into AE to add a few extra effects.       I'm doing a little project, private, only for myself... a 1950s movie where several visual effects were needed but the producer ran out of budget. I have some original storyboards & thought it would be interesting to try to recreate those "missing shots".  I have AE and would like to see if I could add a few matte paintings.      What is the best file format that would preserve the original video quality/imagery through the download/conversion of a DVD clip -- and then import it into AE? (I'm trying to avoid compression and information loss. Unfortunately, After Effects doesn't accept .avi files).       Thank you very much for your suggestions & help.

When it came to entering the product key, I found the sticker but instead of the license code it said "Direct CD No Key".  Searching Microsoft forums proved fruitless and Google just linked me to illegal downloading/Torrent sites which is no good.  It is a full proper license of XP Home with the holograms and watermarks, just no code!        Does anyone know how I can get the product key from this?  I know there are Keyfinder programs but I cannot proceed any further into the Windows installation so they are no good.  Will Microsoft supply a key and if so what credentials will I need to supply to prove that is legitimate?      Many thanks

20090205021941AANplAB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	How to configure Lexmark E120 laser printer for Vista?	I just bought the E120 today. Salesman didn't tell me the USB cord needed to be bought separately, so I've used the cord from my LaCie HDD to connect it to my PC. Installation CD wouldn't work, so I downloaded the drivers from the Lexmark website. It seems to have installed properly, but when I try to print anything, it doesn't seem to send to the printer. When I open the Printers status, it says "Error - Printing" or "Error - Sent to printer". I can print a test page using the button on the printer, but can't print one using a computer command. Could it be because of the USB connection? Or can you suggest anything I can do to fix it? The Lexmark support is closed until tomorrow morning and my father needs some things printed urgently.   Thanks so much to anyone who answers!

The wireless in our house is crap and unreliable. So i thought i would buy 2 powerline homeplug adaptors (They send the signal across the wiring in the house)      my brothers computer is connected to the the router (wired) in his room. he has no problems with the connection and it is quite fast and he is on XP.      the first powerline adpator is connected to the router by an ethernet lead then it is plugged in2 the wall socket in my brothers room      the second powerline adaptor is connected to my computer by an ethernet lead and then plugged into the wall scoket in my room.      it should work mo problems but i try and connect it and i keep getting this error code       CONNECTING THORUGH WAN MINIPORT (PPPOE)      ERROR 815 - THE BROADBAND NETWORK CONNECTION COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED ON YOUR COMPUTER BECAUSE THE REMOTE SERVER IS NOT RESPONDING. THIS COULD BE CAUSED BY AN INVALID VALUE FOR THE 'SERVICE NAME' FIELD FOR THIS CONNECTION. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR ISP AND INQUIRE ABOUT THE VALUE FOR THIS FIELD AND UPDATE IT IN THE CONNECTION PROPERTIES      i have loaded the software that came with the adaptors and it registers that both of them are on the network but i can only get one connected.      i have even tried swapping the adaptors over to see if that mite help. it only seems to want to connect to the adpator i had in here! i put that in my brothers room and it connected but the one that was in my brothers room doesnt want to connect even if its in here.      we are both on the same floor.      its really beginning to annoy me!      This has annoyed me no end due to the fact that these things have got a really good rating for being simple to setup and i thought it would be easy. Could someone let me know if they know how to sort this out with step by step instructions as am not very good at this sort of thing. Am on vista premium and any help would be appreciated.

20090205030859AA6GHTM	Computers & Internet;Security	How can I get rid of this Trojan virus?	As you may be able to tell from the question I have a Trojan virus problem. It is called "Trojan.Bisv.A!inf". I don't understand any of the technical jargon so I don't know what it does specifically besides it affects your multimedia files in some way. I'm also not sure about what it does because last time I got a Trojan virus, which was years ago, it stuffed up my computer to the max. I don't remember how I got rid of it last time. I have a Windows Vista and I downloaded some Symantec thingy that is supposed to remove the virus. Everytime I run it the program says there isn't any Trojan virus on my computer. However Norton Internet Security scans keep coming up with the virus. The Norton program itself can't remove the virus so I need to find another way to remove it..... Any ideas?????

20090205033550AAaDdIJ	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Infuriating browsing problem?	I am having severe problems when trying to browse the internet. I am using Firefox mainly, but have the same problems with Internet Explorer. I apologise this is quite a long post, but I really need your help.      It's like the browser "times out" immediately, nothing happens when I click a link. Just dead. In Firefox it shows the loading progress of the web page you are trying to get to in the bottom right hand corner - 90% see no progress at all. However, if I keep hitting refresh button or the link of the web page I am trying to get to (anywhere up to 20 times) I see  the progress bar working and then the page will eventually load.       However, when it does load the page it's usually incomplete, pictures missing often the format of the page completely wrong - layout screwed, fonts incorrect size etc. If I refresh many more times I will eventually get to see the page how it is supposed to be.      I have had this computer for over 2 years. I had no real problems with it for most of that time. About 2 months ago I started having the exact same problem I am having now, so decided to Format (for the first time on this computer) which corrected the problem for a couple of weeks. The exact same thing happened not long after so I formatted again & again it was fine... until yesterday.      This is not strictly a connection problem. When I use Vuze to download torrents I get decent speeds - up to 700 kb/s and also when I can get on world of warcraft, I stay connected with ms under 200.       It is a 2mb broadband connection, but those speeds are decent for such a rural area. I have no download speed caps or limits from my ISP.      When I reboot my computer everything works fine for 10 minutes or so. Then this happens ALL over again.      I can't begin to explain how frustrating this is.      The computer is dual core Pentium D 2x2.66mhz, with 1 GB RAM running Windows XP professional with service Pack 2.   The motherboard is ASrock 775i945GZ (full details of it here:  http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?Mo...    The graphic card is a 512mb Nvidia Geforce 7300 GS. I downloaded and installed the latest set of drivers last night.   The harddrive is small - just 80gb with next to nothing on it, I have more than 1000gb on USB harddrives.      The computer connects to the net via Router. It is a BT voyager wireless router, but I had problems running wireless so now it is wired via ethernet cables. It connects my girlfriends computer and this one. This computer is placed outside the DMZ. I also have disabled all firewall settings in an attempt to correct the problem. I have not, as yet, had a chance to check my girlfriends PC but when I had this problem in the past she had no such problems.      I have turned the router off and on, but have not done a full reset to factory settings as I would have to re-do all my port forwarding settings. If this could be the problem I could do this.      I am absolutely stumped I have NO IDEA at all. The only program I installed recently was TMPCGENC DVD author 1.6 it does alter the registry information but does not connect to the net in anyway at all.      The only hardware I changed before this problem was the graphic card. I cannot see how this would be the problem.      So in short - I cannot load web pages properly.       Can anybody offer an explanation?    Is there anyway I can stop the browser "timing out" - maybe a manual setting regarding how it loads the information?   Should I possibly try "repairing windows" or creating a new partition?

20090205031901AAgK1jP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Are macs overpriced, compared to pc's of course?	I mean for example Why is an upgrade to a 128GB SSD on the macbookpro $500 from 320GB at 5400rpm while dells is $200 from 320GB at 7200rpm. you can get a faster dell studio for 80% the price of the new macbook, and the dv5t has been out for a very long time and it can beat the maxed out $3000 new macbookpro 15 inch in all specs at just $1800. Even the new 17 inch can be beet in all specs for half the price, except for the battery life, and that battery life is accomplished just from the use of a new technology which will be in pretty much all new pc's within the year just like multitouch technology. I'm mean is the on average 50% mark up really worth it, isnt it more money wise to be patient and wait for a year

My computer just got infected with lots of spyware/adware/malwares. So I installed MalwareByte's Anti-malware and that removed most of or all of the malwares and put them in quarantine.   Anyway the problem is after I deleted the malwares, I get this error saying Win32 program not responding. So I send error report.    After an hour, I left my PC idle and by the time I get back, AVG won't update. The Internet Explorer won't work anymore.   I deleted all Temp files, tried to re/disconnect the router wires. When I reconnect, it doesn't say Status connected. Actually it doesn't say anything.   I have no internet connection on my PC, but I get an internet connection through my laptop. It goes through the same router/switch.   I think it's malware problem. I didn't fully scan it yet, but I get 0 infection on Quick Scans.       PLEASE HELP. I'm willing to go to computer repair in order to get this fixed even though, I'm short on cash.       Thanks.
