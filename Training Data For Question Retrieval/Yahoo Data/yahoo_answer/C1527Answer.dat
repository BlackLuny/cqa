IxoBFCpTaa	It would be the same as today. If you live in the western world, it is not based on religion that much. The politics is not really related to religion.<br>  ___________________<br>  <br>  I see; you are getting this from your previous question. Being an atheist does not mean without religion, but without God. There is a difference between the two; this is what we get from deists, pantheists, etc who do not believe in religion like we do. <br>  <br>  I also do not understand how no religion would mean that men would rule the world. Most atheists seem to think the opposite way: they say religion is the cause that women are downgraded, even though I disagree with them.|`|1bubNOQmaa	I don't understand your question - for most of the history of humans there have been religions, and men have been dominant over women in almost every one.  It's only as our humanity has grown that our gender equality has grown.  This is only because women became better educated and realized we weren't inferior, not because the men decided to recognize this fact but because WE recognized it and fought for that belief to be recognized by all.|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  Does Allah not tell you to say IF or But?

The damage to others/society in general/him if he cheated is considerably less than the damage that would happen were he to fail the test.|`|WseLyvSpaa	Like all good moral questions the answer is dependent on circumstance, which is why religious absolutists are so bad at morals:<br>  <br>  Is it a test the government is giving to see whether he is smart enough to be allowed to live?

But the laws of morality are far more complicated than cheating on a test. A gray area could arise where your friend's future depended on such a test and the universe put YOU next to him or her in order to make the path they are supposed to walk reveal itself. Intent to do harm is rewarded with negative karma. Intent to do good is rewarded with positive karma. Neutral karma exists as well. All will be as it should be. Morality is defined by intent.|`|3CxtflUsaa	Religion - or the lack thereof -  has nothing to do with morals.

One your friend is taking an advantage they don't deserve against people who are not cheating and earning their scores the hard way. Another is that your friend will not really know the material. If this is something that will come up again this will hurt them. If their performance and success is based on having a foundation that they don't really have and if are counting on them having that competence and ability based on the test results. I understand its tempting to help a friend but I don't think you will really be helping them in the larger picture. I'd rather help them prepare to take it honestly.|`|n0uMBKtJaa	Act only on that maxim whereby at the same time you can will it to become a universal law. ---(Paraphrased) Kant<br>  <br>  If cheating became a universal law then no one would have the answer to anything because they'd just want to cheat instead of learning the material therefore cheating would be pointless because you'd always be wrong thus defeating your reason for cheating.<br>  <br>  This rule doesn't apply to everything (after all I still think for the most part that Kant is an emotionless idiot) but it does work well here :)|`|AA11058044	Depends on the test.<br>  <br>  If it's an internet purity test, then it's immoral, that sh*t is sacred.<br>  <br>  If it's a pregnancy test or sobriety test, it's perfectly fine to sneak your buddy the answers.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Pointless.

You have to learn how to be True to Yourself before you will ever know how to be True to others.

That is personal, between you and the divine and no one else's business, period.<br>  <br>  Be Yourself, "who cares what others think" they are not you!  Don't allow others to suck the life out of you just to please them, if you do, depression will follow, speaking from experience.<br>  <br>  Do your own thing, in your own time.

He's trying to fill your head with there thoughts and then make you feel guilty.<br>  But Jesus said "I have come so that you may have life, and have it to the FULL."<br>  If you know that you believe in God and desire to live for Him, you've got it girl! <br>  If you have that desire, Jesus is in your heart. You are saved and you are His. <br>  And isn't it so amazing to know that you're His! Everyday I'm amazed that the God of everything actually passionately loves me, and wants me. And I know that He does. Never in my life have I been so sure of anything. And i know He passionately loves and wants you too :)<br>  So you don't need to be afraid. If you really love God and want to live for Him, that's being saved. You are saved! :) What a blessing!<br>  And i cannot wait to meet you in Heaven.<br>  <br>  Feelings like this are going to come, I still have them sometimes.

You can fall back on Him :)<br>  <br>  Prayer is such an important thing in having a true relationship with God, so pray for His guidance and comfort. Also, reading His word is so so important.

The evil he doesnt want to do, he does.  He explains the Law of Sin battling against the Law of god - ALL BELIEVERS have this battle.    (let me know if this helps)

Evolutionists have placed a picture at one particular excavation so that tourists can see how the animal and plants lived in the region "millions of years ago."

Or stop smoking pot, it's making you really paranoid)<br>  <br>  Do you honestly believe we scientists get together and ignore data just to disprove religion????<br>  <br>  The fossil record makes absolutely no sense for a young earth ( no dinosaurs never had saddles).<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  "no, more people have claimed to see angels and supernatural stuff than fossils found. lol"<br>   <br>  <br>  Yeah.  Except you can hold a fossil in your hand.  "I swear I saw an angel" isn't exactly proof.  I mean the closest thing you guys have is a picture of "the virgin mary" on a grilled cheese.   Sorry if that isn't all that convincing to those of us with a brain.|`|AA12193600	Scientists are interested in truth no matter who it offends. Scientists say it's rare to find a fossil because that is the truth--the conditions that fossilize a plant or animal are not particularly common place. A animal carcass laying in the open will not fossilize--it will simply decompose.  A animal that gets stuck in a mud flat for example--may fossilize if the animal carcass is covered up by mud rapidly enough.  This is why fossils of leaves are more commonplace than animal fossils.  It's easier for a leaf to fall from a tree and get buried in the soil.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	Walk across the Serengeti plain, it's full of wildebeest, zebra, elephants, warthogs, In fact almost uncountable animals. Hundreds of them die each day, but where are the bodies, where are the bones? You may be lucky and come across the remains of  lion's kill, vultures ripping the bits of carcass to bits. But then the hyenas turn up, and there go the bones. You might be lucky if it's a buffalo the skull might be left, but it will eventually weather away. This is the landscape humans spent the formative years in<br>  <br>  Now, if one of these creatures has died at a secluded waterhole and there was a flash flood, the body covered in sediment then it might survive and fossilise. Or perhaps if it was unlucky enough to get caught in a volcanic eruption and drowned in dust and ash then one day its materialised bones could be dug up. Now tell me why you never even made the effort to find out why terrestrial fossils are so rare.|`|AA11946554	They have plenty of fossils that are millions of years old. Just not as plentiful as would be more helpful.<br>  Think about it. What exactly do you think can survive thousands, millions of years of change? Seriously, do you have any idea how much the earth goes through? Take a geology class. The 'rocks' even cycle-there have been earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, animal interaction with the surroundings...everything organic, even bone, deteriorates over time unless the conditions are 'just so'. Between all that, it's great that there are any remains left.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	Because the conditions necessary for fossilization to occur are rare.<br>  <br>  They were rare a billion years ago, they are rare now.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are rocks at least 3 billion years old.  The Earth has to be at least that old.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  More people have seen angels than fossils?   Want to bet?  While fossils of a specific species can be very rare indeed finding a fossil of some sort is not that hard.<br>  <br>  I would suspect that there are more fossils in the Natural History Museum than the number of people who have seen angels.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	OK. How about this. You go into the minimal condition  it takes to become fossilised, and then survive for over a million years, facing erosion, worms and bacteria.<br>  Not everything dies in the perfect place to become fossilised.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	nope. <br>  Why don't you dig in the closest cemetery to see how many fossilized humans you find. You can then extrapolate from your results. If you find zero fossils, then fossilization is not a common event, ok?|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Not that many animals and such stayed in perfect form.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Stella, when you follow the link to the Methodology section you discover that the sample size was FAR too small to have any true and direct relevance to the general population (<1/2 %). Considering that the samples were obtained by random cold calls would explain why such a high percentage of responses were "No response". People tend to simply hang up on such surveys and would be recorded as NO response. This number correlates perfectly with similar studies which show a similar response for just about any random phone survey. The failure to break down the data into further sub-categories IS a big let-down for me as it seems to be with you. <br>  <br>  If we take Llewellyn Worldwide's latest figures for Buckland's Big Blue Book (2,223,518 copies) as a figure from which to work and estimate that about 30% of the buyers of that book never go on to follow Wicca, add to that about 15% who either lose or destroy the book, we would come up with a more realistic number of practicing Wiccans of around 1,334,110 practicing Wiccans in the United States. This is a significantly higher figure than was reported in the ARIS figures. Now if we acknowledge that an additional 20% of Buckland's book was sold outside of the U.S., we would still come up with about 1,111,758 milion Wiccans in the U.S. This is still a full order of magnitude greater than the ARIS figures. I obtained these figures through a friend who actually works at Llewellyn and is in a position to actually KNOW how many books have been actually SOLD as opposed to numbers that are remaining as unsold inventory, and his information is 100% reliable.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm not going to dish you out MY theories about the disparity between both sets of numbers BUT, keep in mind the Trinity College IS a Divinity College. Their numbers show a similar disparity among Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims and OTHER non-Christian Religions in the U.S., whose own internal census shows a vastly different number of adherents as well, and along the SAME order of magnitude. This translates to a far greater number of members of the family of Chistian Religions as decreasing by FAR greater numbers than the ARIS report would suggest. Unfortunately the ONLY truly accurate way to get a handle on REAL membership would be through the National Census in 2010 and I highly doubt that such a query would appear on that Census survey.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	I think it's interesting, definitely. I would like to see a break down, but I feel shocked that the number is that big. It certainly doesn't feel that way, but then, I live in Amish country, so, environment. <br>  <br>  Since Santeria is included in NRM, I sort of wonder where Vodou went, considering it was actually uninterrupted, and older than LDS.<br>  <br>  That said, I think they would be more peeved to be included with us, since the few Santeros I've come in contact with also consider themselves devout Catholics.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Only mildly annoyed. I'm eclectic anyway so there's only one of me. Take out Scientology, which is a religion of fiction, and Santeria, which has a bad rep of sacrifice, and I'm okay being listed with the others.<br>  <br>  I do wish there were more precise numbers. I think there are more of us than many people realize. But it's hard to prove it when the research is so vague.|`|HWYutIJDaa	Hopefully the increase is not entirely due to scientologists.... somehow I doubt the number of Rastafarians has increased dramatically. <br>  <br>  "Indian" Religion - is that Indian non-Hindu such as jainist, Zoroastrian or Native American ?<br>  <br>  Encouraged to see that the number specifiying 'no religion' has almost doubled.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	I have no problem with us being included in the "New Religious Movements."  Wicca IS an NRM.  Plain and simple, it clearly fits the definition.  Calling religions NRM does not imply those religions are similar.  All it says is that they are newer religions (generally less than 200 years old).<br>  <br>  You seem to be mad that they aren't catering to your specific needs.  Yes, I would like to see specific numbers for Wicca.  That doesn't make them flawed for not providing it.  Also, counting specific memberships for NRMs can be highly dodgy.  Most people accept that there were far more than 100,000 Wiccans in 2001, for example.  So maybe they concluded that the specific numbers were not helpfully accurate, and thought a more general statistic would better represent the truth.<br>  <br>  Finally, have you tried asking them for specific numbers?  They may have the numbers available but simply chose not to include it in the report.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	As a heathen I can only say that it simply confirms my suspicions that the vast majority of people - including the "experts" - don't know the difference between a heathen, a pagan, a deist, a.....  Well, they don't realize there are vast differences. I can see why they'd separate out catholics and protestants rather than just put them all under the label "christian", but to put a faith such as mine under "new religious movements" when it is somewhere around 8,000 years old is more than a bit asinine.  It smacks of a horrific level of ignorance about the very thing they're trying to analyze. A better choice would have been to separate out "new religious movements" and "pre-judaic" or "old faith" religions. It would be much less insulting to people like me and would also show they know WTF they're analyzing at least.<br>  <br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  Oh - since we don't proselytize and we're not real into converts, tending to view them with more than a little suspicion, I'm actually fairly happy  that I can't judge any growth in my own faith outside of our own birth rates.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Sorry sweetie but both links would not open for some reason. Page unavailable it says on both. <br>  <br>  It's a bit like politics isn't it. The conservative party, the labor party, liberal democrats, and others. I don't take offense at being labeled as 'other'. It means I have won, I am different, I have broken free of the mundane. <br>  <br>  There are lies, damn lies and then there are statistics. Statistics are about the biggest act of futility ever invented. They can be changed to meet any result you wish. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman.. .quantum physics rocks.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Honestly, it doesn't matter. Many pagans don't come out of the broom closet simply because of the types of people they share a community with. I don't know how they come up with their statistics. I have never been asked by someone doing a consensus on my religious affiliation. Guess I would make it difficult as I am a UU Eclectic Pagan.|`|dFBccLExaa	I find it sad overall that no one seems to validate any pagan religion enough to actually count it worth something. Anything related to counting the numbers of religious only looks at the abrahamic faiths or atheism. That's it. I agree, it's very very sad that we're all lumped together... but I guess that's the way it is *leh sigh*.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	The only one I am uncomfortable about being lumped together with is Scientology. And what the hell is Eckankar?<br>  Off to look it up, now...|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Ew. Were old. Just makin a comeback sista! <br>  <br>  <br>  Lol scientology...well to each his own. :)|`|NsLtN7oLaa	Well, I think the important finding in ARIS is that<br>  Christianity is declining steadily. I'll refrain from a<br>  grocery list of the reasons for that, but it's clear<br>  that soon they will no longer constitute a majority,<br>  or wield the sort of political power that we have seen<br>  in the past... what a relief !<br>  <br>  As to the treatment of our various traditions, the<br>  survey did mention that it was getting difficult to<br>  deal with the large number of so-called NRM's...<br>  (new religious movements). That's a strange <br>  title for religions like mine which is over 9000 <br>  years old.... but I suppose they would classify<br>  it as neo-pagan, since there was an "interruption" <br>  (due to being mass murdered by Christians) and <br>  we have had to re-create some of our rituals.<br>  <br>  Anyway, since the NRM total was only 1.2%,<br>  breaking it down farthur probably would have not<br>  served much purpose... but the group is growing<br>  fast... up 50% in 18 years... so as we become<br>  larger, we can expect to see the statistic broken<br>  down into various traditions.<br>  <br>  Finally, I think the survey provides some valuable<br>  clues as to how those of us who are doing outreach<br>  might best structure our efforts in the coming decades.<br>  <br>  Bright Blessings,<br>  <br>  Jean

Funny thing is, I am not in agreement on water baptism in general or at least the reason the baptists believe in it, but that is not so much a doctrine as a sacrament if you will, so nothing to worry about or to not fellowship over.   They are involved in outreaches worldwide with missionaries being sent out to Haiti and to Asia.   The church is involved in many good works also in the community and to it's members.

When she was 6, her proud, noble parents walled her up beside a chapel. She could not get out, but could attend Mass and receive the Sacraments. After 14 years of imprisonment, her parents took her to a shrine to pray for a cure. When no cure was forthcoming, they abandoned her. She became a lay Dominican and spent the rest of her life in prayer and works of mercy. When she died at age 33, the townspeople thronged to her funeral and demanded that "the saint" be buried in a tomb inside the church. The priest protested, but when a crippled girl was miraculously cured at the funeral, the people had their way.  Her body is still incorrupt.|`|Run7dyraaa	what on earth are you talking about?

And no, it doesn't "prove" that there's "no God". It DOES show how the curse of sin has attacked our bodies ever since Creation. When Adam and Eve first started out, there were no diseases, no mutations, no deformities. These came about gradually as a result of the Fall. <br>  But the inner human dignity of Joseph Merrick was a testament to the "image of God" within him.

To bad it ain't going to fly.|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	A couple of things you need to know:<br>  <br>  First, the Elephant man existing does not prove or disprove that God<br>  exists.<br>  <br>  Second, I knew a young boy who was completely paralyzed from the<br>  neck down.  He spoke thru a tube connected to a computer with lines<br>  to his voice box.  HE IS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN.  A newpaper guy<br>  asked him if he is angry at God for doing this to him.  The boy<br>  said this:<br>  <br>  "Angry at God for what?  I never knew him before - I was too busy<br>  with dumb things, but now I know him.  Thats why I'm happier than<br>  I've ever been, but I feel so sorry for the people who are lost; they<br>  are more crippled than I could ever be".<br>  <br>  Now I ask you:<br>  Can you find a brighter or better testimony or witness for God?<br>  When this boy "speaks", people listen.  He is a greater witness to<br>  the love of God than all the Churches, Pastors and Priests in the<br>  World put together.  <br>  <br>  The Elephant man's life was not destroyed by God; it was destroyed<br>  by a disease.  You sound very ugly inside, like a disease has taken<br>  your heart and destroyed it, too.  Do you blame everything on God?<br>  Does that make you better able to justify your own bad deeds? Or<br>  are you one of these who blames the devil for everything? Try taking<br>  some personal responsibility for a change. God gave us life in the flesh<br>  for a specific purpose; the flesh is very fragile and is prone to disease, damage and ultimately death.  We live in a natural world where we<br>  have weather patterns that can be dangerous, high winds that cause<br>  people to die who are on ships,  landslides that send mud rolling down<br>  at an astronomical pace wherein whole homes are destroyed and<br>  people unfortunately killed.  God does not cause these things, but we<br>  are here in this natural world and hopefully with common sense you<br>  can avoid most of these bad occurances.  But don't blame God for<br>  everything.<br>  Do you blame God for:<br>  <br>  the hungry?  He put you here, so go feed them.<br>  the poor?     He put you here, so go help them.<br>  the sick?     He put you here, so go and comfort them.<br>  <br>  God was asked when the wall fell and killed several men, was it because those men had sinned?  Gods reply was no, the reason that<br>  those men died when the wall fell, was because they were near the<br>  wall when it hit the ground.   God didn't build the wall, God didn't<br>  shake the wall, and God didn't throw it down to the ground; but more<br>  importantly, God didn't tell any of those men to stand next to the<br>  wall when it fell.  So why did good men die that day? They died because when solid concrete smashes the human body between it<br>  and the hard ground, the human body gets crushed, thats why.<br>  The flesh body is fragile.  Thankfully, we have a better body to look<br>  forward to that is much more durable, because it needs to last an<br>  eternity.  These bodies only need to last for a short period of time.<br>  <br>  God is not evil, but there are some people in this world who are evil<br>  when they attempt to blame natural occurences on their own Creator<br>  without regard or knowledge of the truth.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 3,000 individuals (NF type 1). The "Elephant Man" had NF type 2 affecting about 1 in 200,000.

Ants get poisoned, cattle get butchered, but that doesn't mean there is no God. Why is there anything in which humans assign a negative value?  Is it because humans don't know God and live in ignorance? <br>  <br>  We assign values to everything based on pain and pleasure, what helps us survive and what doesn't. God didn't assign those values, you and the the rest of society did. Perhaps God has values that we don't understand which are more important to Him. Suppose God's values transcends the physical world, a world that to God is just an illusion and doesn't exists but is necessary for His purposes.|`|Yje1ZUAFaa	I have asked something like that myself. I think the argument that there is in fact no God is so rationally strong that it goes hand in hand with judgemental fundamentalists engaging in serious atheist bashing to overcompensate.<br>  <br>  I also see the arguments for Christianity and Islam prove there is no God.<br>  <br>  Abernathy-stop kidding yourself.

And it was a genetic mutation. And the elephant did not lead a bad life, he was knighted by the queen, later on.<br>  <br>  But it proves that you must always watch what you do. I think it called Karma?? And if you have read the Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux, you might find out a thing or two.|`|cPGSRwm2aa	Yeah, God is messed up. How could he allow an innocent person to live such hell on earth? He would have to be so evil to think up such a thing that the most evil men in history would become His disciples?<br>  <br>  The thing is, that innocent person was His Son, Jesus. And those evil men that became His disciples? They eventually gave their lives for God and that's why Christian organizations today have more to do with charity and relief worldwide than all the other organizations put together.<br>  <br>  The answer is that God is the answer to all evil. No matter what you're going through, He's been there. In fact, He's been to hell and back. The thing is, we deserve it and He doesn't, but He did it so that you don't have to. Don't waste a good thing. Find out what good God is doing in this evil world today.|`|7z1Mfcdqaa	From what I understand having seen the movie John Merrick was a beautiful human being.

It simply exists from living in a multi-metaverse full of forces and beings that are buffeted by those forces.  The only way suffering is overcome is because Jesus Christ has atoned for us, giving us a way to subdue forces that challenge us.<br>  <br>  God doesn't allow suffering.  Exhibit One: The Ten Commandments (lots of advice on how not to suffer or create suffering in others).<br>  <br>  God does allow us to have agency (choice) and he does allow us to experience all that there is to experience here on earth.  We agreed to come here knowing it would be challenging.  But we wanted knowledge.<br>  <br>  But God's main activity is to rescue us and heal us and otherwise lift us from suffering, now and forever.<br>  <br>  What was the Elephant Man's own opinion about his life condition and his relationship to God?  Did he believe he was in hell?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are angry, and want to help and defend innocent people in the earth.  I'm sure God loves that about you, and you should give free expression to that Defender's heart of yours.  Serve your fellow beings like crazy!!|`|3CxtflUsaa	You base your opinion of God on what has been taught by every christian, jew, muslim, etc. Remember that these holy texts were written by men. <br>  <br>  Religion was created by the few to control the many. And many harms are done in HIS name, and many harms are done because of the lack of faith in HIM. You can't win. <br>  <br>  Your question has no answer but every christian, jew, muslim will answer as his holy text dictates. And that is not the truth. Because no one knows the truth, it's all conjecture.<br>  <br>  The Eelephant man just was, and it was his fellow man that made his life hell. He lived well in the end, albeit not like he wanted. I hope he is in a better place, living as he wished. He deserves it.<br>  <br>  It's what we do for each other in life that matters, God doesn't have much to do w/ it. Want to make someone life miserable? Go ahead, just don't use God as an excuse. Want to make someone happy? By all means, just don't use the fear/love of God as a reason. Do it because it's right. <br>  <br>  But that's my just my opinion. :-)  God Bless!|`|SHwuzsPyaa	shut up<br>  <br>  i could just say why did god allow you to be so ignorant?<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  why did god allow you to have good health when someone else could use it much more than you|`|oofVoI2Vaa	No more than that the existence of Robin proved Batman s**ked.|`|G2PRIe3laa	He's no worse than the tree dude (yuk)

We believers need no further evidence to convince us that a loving God does indeed exist. If, however, it will help you lose the attitude, I'd be happy to provide you with two solid pieces of evidence for a logical belief in God. <br>  <br>  1. The generally accepted theory of the Big Bang posits that billions of years ago, in a sudden, massive explosion of light and energy, all things in the universe were created. While this event did indeed produce the tangible, atomic foundations for all material things that now exist, scientists concur that because nothing could have existed prior to the event, it must have also produced all non-tangible entities in the universe - most notably time and the laws of nature. That said, if nature itself was created in the Big Bang (a theory promoted by a primarily atheistic community of scientists), then by definition, whatever caused the Big Bang to occur must have been Supernatural (Latin: super, meaning "above" or "beyond"). What that Supernatural entity is called is entirely up to you, I call it God. <br>  <br>  2. There has yet to be any widely supported scientific theory explaining the inherent human qualities of conscious, moral thought. <br>  <br>  The claim that life has come into existence by sheer chance and from a place (space before the Big Bang) devoid of literally anything - material and immaterial - is easily explained away when looking a the insanity of such a claim when applied to other things in our world. Take a can of Pepsi, for example. If I were to say to you that the Pepsi can was not made, it simply came into being, what would you say? Taking that one step further, how would you react if I were to tell you that the Pepsi can started out as nothing. Then, over billions of years, small fragments of aluminum began to piece themselves together in a cylindrical shape. Then, over a span of another few hundred million years, blue paint began to cover the can. But not only blue paint, red and white too. Then by sheer coincidence, letters started appearing on the can and spelled out "Pepsi." After another million or so years, nutritional information showed up on the back of the can. Once the can was self-shaped and self-painted, with words and designs and logos covering every square inch, a dark sugary liquid began to fill the can. And once the can was full, then magically, it sealed itself. THAT, my friend, is the epitome of the Atheist argument. By sheer coincidence, humans, plants and animals, along with all of the things we need to survive, have come into being on this earth. <br>  <br>  Get over yourself.

sE94HgDBaa	I am Circassian. Circassians are originally from Northwest Caucasus mountain region, now a part of Russia.  (Places like Nalchik, Cherkessia- which are close to Georgia and Ossetia on a map. Also Maikop but that's further North).  Most are displaced (now live in diaspora) since the Russian-Circassian war which lasted for about 100 years up to 1864. There are many in ME (probably the highest condensed population in ME is in Turkey but there are plenty in Jordan, Syria and other places. There are communities in Germany and lots in America- especially Jersey and California).  Circassian is our name in English, it was named from the Turks back when the Ottoman Empire was in existance, we call ourself Adigha; and Cicassia is Kafkasya. I have to go now, but I will post a map for you later.|`|OJWApbmbaa	There people from the Caucasion mountains who live in Turkey, Egypt, and Syria and there not Arab or Turkish.

AA12181796	Exactly - to be honest, pro-life is more anti-choice than pro-choice is pro-death. What also angers me about that bumper sticker is that it assumes that all babies are conceived by accident, and these wonderful, angelic women made a selfless choice to have the child they hadn't planned for, at the same time belittling the many good reasons women have for having an abortion. Of course some women conceive by accident, and choose to keep the baby, but it's not true of all women who get pregnant. Clearly if a couple plans a pregnancy, they're not going to choose to abort.|`|AA11946554	:-)<br>  I completely agree with your mother. I am definitely pro-choice and have a 13 1/2 year old son. I love him very much and if I could go back in time, I would do it all again. He's very intelligent and one of the things in my life I could not be prouder of.<br>  I WISH more people would view accidental pregnancy as a good thing, at least in the long run, but I know they don't and there's at least one, if not one daily, story a week about how some dumb female ends up killing, or severely damaging her child-either directly or indirectly (ie-her 'b/f' shakes/beats the child).<br>  I think it would be much more humane to just let those people have an abortion. You never know what kind of people are involved. Then there are medical and psychological considerations.<br>  I saw a bumper sticker that says, 'If you can't trust me with a choice, how can you trust me with a child?'<br>  'Pro-life' is anti-choice and many times, anti-life.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	No, it means in your case, your mom was "pro-LIFE" - that is, she believed you had the right to live.

Some Christians at conversion experience an incredible joy which may be a foretaste of heaven and the life to come. Have you sought and found the Risen Christ for yourself. I left it to the age of 35 to make that discovery because I was too wrapped up in higher level Science. Follow Jesus tonight if you do not already know Him as Lord!|`|HbCWNCQzaa	we will be very aware in heaven|`|5shqstYraa	We will find out on judgment day|`|5nCKxYsUaa	how can you be unconscious and happy ?|`|f0xROd1daa	I have heard different people's theory on Heaven that you may be in just a happy state in the presence of God, but I personally believe that heaven is a place where we will actually be able to roam around and do thing. Jesus said in John 14:2 "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you" also in Revelations it speaks of a city with a street of pure gold. if there are mansions and streets than you probably wouldn't be in just an unconscious state of being.<br>  <br>  Also to the second part of your question; it doesn't matter if you think you are going to be unconscious in Heaven, that doesn't determine whether or not you will go to Heaven or Hell. What determines on whether or not you you go to Heaven or not is that you accept Jesus as your personal savior. To get into Heaven first you must realize you are a sinner; the Bible says in Romans 3: 23 " For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God", then in Romans 6:23 it states that "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." what that means is if you've ever sinned than you are domed to hell, BUT to go to Heaven you have to accept the gift of God for salvation. in Romans 10:9 it says "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."  If you pray to God and admit that you are a sinner, ask God for forgiveness, believe that Jesus is the Son of God and he died for your sins because he loves you, than you will be saved and go to Heaven. Romans 10:13 says " For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  Whosoever means ANYONE and EVERYONE has the opportunity to be saved and God WILL save them.<br>  <br>  Jesus Loves You.

The best way to go about this is to look up new age shops in your town. Go in and get a feel for the place/people. Look for/ask about message boards in the shop that people advertise services on. You can usually find some one on those that will help, but there is still gonna be a price involved. Also, there is usually someone working in these shops who has experience with this themselves, or can direct you to someone good. Blessed be.<br>  <br>  Karma makes a valid point. If you have bad intentions, 1) you'll be hard pressed to find a real Wiccan who will help you, 2) it will come back on you anyway because your still sending it out even though it's through someone else.|`|6f71b2cd793ff1b2e18fbf2a075142a9aa	LOL  I Like To Explode Things believes in flying magical talking ponies, but not Wicca!<br>  <br>  Anyway, Do a little research and perform the spell yourself.  It will work out better that  way.  And do not pay anyone exorbitant sums of money to someone who says you are under a curse and that they can lift it.  It's a scam.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Anyone can put up a site and the internet is used for business as well as exchanging Information. <br>  <br>  You cannot just buy a spell. No reputable person would do anything unless assured that the need was desperate and justified.  For that you would have to meet someone in person and give a lot of information, after making sure you could trust said person. <br>  <br>  It is better to rely on good, old-fashioned working it out for yourself.  If you have a problem try to sort it out before getting outside help.|`|elYa6YFuaa	OMG people, this is so annoying!?!?!?! Harry Potter magic crap aint real omg!!!?!?!|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	You're not likely to find a legitimate site online that will cast spells for you without charging you a pretty penny.  Real witches don't work this way.  <br>  <br>  And think about it - how would you know some contact over the internet actually cast a spell for you?  They could just take your money and send you a notice in a couple of days that says your spell has been cast, and you wouldn't be the wiser, other than the seed of thought would be planted in your head, so you might actually "make it work" even though they did nothing. (Self-fulfilled prophesy)  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you should just consider empowering yourself to make the changes you need to.<br>  <br>  Or, if you specify your need, others here may be able to offer you advice on how to resolve your problem without the aid of magic.|`|zc47c39daa	You will most likely 99.9% of the time only find websites who will charge you a fee, or try to get you to buy from other websites, spam you, etc. It just sounds too good to be true, and in this case- it usually is.<br>  <br>  If you are doing the spell with good intentions and you know how to do it and know what you are getting yourself into, then there's no reason you can't do it. If it's a 'bad' spell and that's why you don't want to preform it yourself, well then why do it in the first place?<br>  <br>  I don't believe you will find someone who would be willing to do one for you, a stranger, through the internet, for free. There will most likely always be a charge. And even then, how do you know if they have really performed the spell? You really don't. Most witches won't be willing to do this for you unless they are out for your money.

iHDYncuXaa	Actually, looking back the 19 years since I became born again I can honestly say I have never considered leaving my faith. It is what gets me through life. It's my sustainer. I haven't found anything that could possibly replace it.|`|AA11923447	Yes, very much so. I'm a lifelong Christian, but have been strongly considering leaving Christianity for another belief system. Have I had doubts? You bet. I've never had such strong doubts before. But I had some experiences over the weekend that are making me think twice. Whichever path I choose, I just don't want to make my decision too hastily.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Converting to what exactly?<br>  Of course.  I think everyone has doubts at some point but that is the point of faith.  Its not for the weak.  You are meant to struggle with your faith.  Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.  If something is easy, you should be asking yourself why.  The same is true in other aspects of your life.  Think about loving relationships.  Those aren't easy, they take work, time and devotion.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Converting to atheism? Well, since atheism isn't a religion, one cannot "convert" to it. One choses to accept that there probably is or that there is no God.<br>  <br>  When I was growing up, I did doubt God as prayers, events and things never went my way even praying before hand. Besides, the world made more sense without a deity.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	"When I was a Christian, I once considered it but never went through with it."<br>  <br>  how were you a christian if you didn't convert?<br>  <br>  i converted to being a Christian.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Oh sure.  Satan puts doubts in my mind.  What I do is go to my experience, over many years, of the truth of the word of God.  That ends that.|`|aJLXBhoAaa	I did doubt once a long time ago but God has made Himself more real to me and I'll never doubt again and I'll never convert.|`|tfkpNh89aa	Nope, never never considered converting to anything....  <br>  <br>  BUT there were many times and many years in my life that I did not acknowledge my religion -Christianity- but never gave it up.  <br>  <br>  I just didn't practice it.  <br>  <br>  Now, I've changed and became at peace with my self and since I'm older, I have a better understanding of lots of things which I never understood before.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Yes.  I've studied world religions and many of the cults, and found them wanting.  Christianity is the only "religion" that makes any sense, and the others have a savior that is dead.  Ours is alive.  Have you ever considered becoming a true christian?  many people think they are, but they are not.  You say that you were, but you are mistaken.  You never were.  I was, however, an atheist, and found that wanting too.  Now I'm glad God chose me, and gave me wisdom to get out of that stupid religion.|`|PDwlIrtsaa	I have never doubted Christ, but I have doubted religion and the church. Christ preached love and forgiveness, but all I seem to hear anymore is fire and damnation, I dont believe in Hell, if there is one this is it, but I do believe that Christ died for our sins and I love him with all my heart. I consider myself a Christian Buddhist.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	Converting to what?<br>  <br>  I was a Christian. Now I am a Pagan. Highly recommended.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	i have doubted before but never once considered converting...not once|`|pfNnuD5saa	I was agnostic, I converted to Christian.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	No way|`|9CKV2Peuaa	It's not enough to accept a religion because it "makes you feel good" or "sustains you" or "helps you from committing suicide" etc. You accept a religion because it makes sense to you and you believe what it calls for. There is something very wrong in staying in a religion that you do not believe in.|`|E0CZ69FYaa	Doubted that He cares, yes. Doubted that He exists, certainly not. There is no way I will EVER switch to atheism or agnosticism. I would die before I didn't believe in God. No, I have not and will not consider another religion. I believe that Christianity has the whole truth.|`|36a3d2a013f3a63ba2e1ac7628f12feaaa	Let's see.  When I WAS, I thought about it, but didn't do it.  What?  It's human to doubt, but Jesus never doubted His love for us.  And convert from hope to no hope, no thanks!  God bless!|`|hMzLqR9qaa	As ashamed as I am to say it, yes. But you know, I think every christian has at one point. Not that im saying its ok or anything, but i think its just apart of our sinful, unbelieving nature.|`|DgJDRA2eaa	i guess there is a individual answer for each individual

Why is this such a big topic now it never was until now. Why was this not a topic in the 50's 60's or whatever. If a biracial person was black enough to be a slave and not white enough to sit in the front of the bus half the time if they say they are black then i don't really care.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Well I'm mixed but I identify as black. My father is half-white and half- native american (blackfoot) but both of his parents died when I was very young. Never got to meet them. I've only been around my mother's side of the family. So I identify myself as black plus I look black so why not. My father never got upset he's been around black ppl all his life also. Although I identify as black if someone was to ask me if I was mixed I never hesitate to tell them that I am.
YMnTveWuaa	I doubt there is such thing as a true atheist. You've been hanging out with JIMBO a bit lately, huh?|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I'm not sure if you are claiming atheists never do those things or defending them from someone else who said it. At any rate, marriage doesn't have to be religious, its also a civil institution. I got married in an entirely nonreligious ceremony at the beach. I won't baptize as I don't believe in it and neither does my husband. I could understand though someone whose spouse did deciding they would respect their feelings. Celebrating Christmas has become a secular-cultural tradition as much as religious. I have Hindu friends who celebrate it non religiously for example because they think its fun and their kids are so surrounded by others that do so.<br>  <br>  If a religious person invites me to a wedding or baptism I generally go to support them and be nice. It doesn't mean anything about my personal beliefs.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	Weddings aren't a Christian ceremony, different faiths and cultures were doing it thousands of years before Christianity.<br>  <br>  I've never been to a Baptism but if I did it would be as a social occasion.<br>  <br>  I celebrate Yule, the ancient celebration of life, light and vitality that became Christmas. Virtually all the things people associate with Christmas are pagan, trees, lights, presents etc.|`|AA12360579	I celebrate Christmas because my family does.  There's nothing religious about our Christmases together, we just exchange gifts and eat good food.  I haven't been baptized by my atheist parents, and I don't plan on baptizing my children.  I plan on getting married eventually for the tax benefits--not that it's a religious institution anyway.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I'm a godmother to two of my nephews.  I've been married for 35 years.  I've gone to every wedding in my family.  Christmas isn't Christian.  Jesus wasn't born on the 25th of December.  No one knows when he was born, so you can't celebrate his birth. My celebrations are secular and FUN!|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Sure I do, when I have to, but I do not pray or recite religious doctrine. I am an Atheist, not a hermit.|`|aEdkaXmtaa	marriage is not always related to religion but besides that yeah..|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Err...I've been married 11 years.|`|1affa83ad0745f49e382a8f368114f59aa	An atheist can go to a wedding or a Christmas party - why not? And getting married is, first and foremost, a legal contract not necessarily is a religious one. Celebrating religious holidays does seem a bit hypocritical, but if all one does is take the day off work like everyone else, then why not? I do get your point about people being mean to each other though - sadly I have seen too many religious folks do that as well.|`|AA12181796	Obviously we wouldn't baptise children. Baptism is a religious practice. Marriage isn't, though, and most major Christian holidays started as Pagan holidays and have now become secular, but we also don't take part in those religiously, clearly. I'm not sure how you go from us not having our own religious wedding to the idea that we wouldn't attend anyone else's. It's not the same thing at all. What exactly are you asking here?|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	I had a civil marriage. Up until 1547, marriages were all civil events, it was the Council of Trent that made marriage a religious thing and the protestants didn't copy them for 50 years or more. None of my children have been baptised, if they ever want to do it, then it's up to them. Most of the people I know had civil weddings, a couple married in church because it was traditional, the participants were not actually atheists, more like don't know, don't care.<br>  Christmas, well I eat, drink and get very merry. It was a festival long before Jesus was born and will be one long after he is forgotten, same with easter, same with the days of the week and the names of the months.|`|SC7sxZDMaa	You're making a lot of assumptions about atheists. What are these assumptions based on? <br>  You are making generalizations about atheists that conform to the stereotype that you have in your mind. You are bigoted regarding atheists. It's no different than those who voice racial stereotypes. Would you find it offensive if I said that all African-Americans eat nothing but fried chicken and watermelon? I would, and I think most African-Americans would too. Your statements about atheists are no different. They are based on stereotypes and ignorance - just like racism! <br>  Do not base your beliefs about atheists on what you read on this website.

We have heard the mullah's calls and seen the gang get down on their lil'rugs, oh yes and gotta face Mecca (good grief) and we celebrated Id Fitah too, right next to Christmas and have a few Hindu gods about the house. We use to live in the Middle East.<br>  <br>  We are True atheist and can in our freedom to think (epistemologically), happily accept all. I do mean all! <br>  <br>  Atheist are usually rather quiet as it is the religious extremest (ever hear of the Crusaders?, Jahadists, Zionists, etc, etc?) that go about killing others. This is agnotology at its best (Ref. Wikipedia).  <br>  <br>  Yep there are happy atheists. Sorry to disappoint. Please read the books below. As a family, we regularly spend time together and enjoy watching the sun go down. A family peaceful celebration every day of the world all about us. <br>  <br>  No need for a goofy man made-up god with all the goofy man made-up lil'rules. Lots of hugs, lots of love and an extended family (a crazy number of what others call races). We laugh a lot. Just a true appreciation of the natural world and a deep commitment for those about us. Gods get in the way of all this. Please, you do not need a god, to find true happiness and a spirit of joy for all. It comes with our DNA!<br>  <br>  No better example of a bad god then the one that claims he has chosen people and put them in a chosen land. Now there is a crock! Guaranteed to bring unhappiness and wars, 2,000 years and still counting! So today the Irish-Catholic believers murdered two British protestant soldiers. I guess they are "Believers."

There are over 1500 references to the OT in the NT. Without the OT, there IS NO NT! <br>  Now, it's true that the Mosaic laws were "nailed to the cross", such as sacrificing animals, because Christ was the "last Lamb" to be slain for our sins; he fulfilled that. However, the 10 Commandments are NOT part of the Mosaic laws. This is God's moral Law, written on stone with His own finger, and it lasts forever. These are absolutely still expected to be obeyed by the Christian. <br>  <br>  1John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.|`|oGVvEl3Maa	your question is worded "What is the view of the Old Testament in Christianity"... not "What is your view of the Old Testament in Christianity."  <br>  <br>  i agree with Poя￠??αιη V?ss??'s answer whole heartedly... she has cited scripture and stated it as simply as possible.<br>  <br>  i believe that is your best answer... and i wonder why she got two thumbs down?  was it because she told the truth... or because she is a Jehovah's Witness...? <br>  <br>  Christians are Christian indeed... if they are Christians...<br>  John 13:35.

I probably shouldn't even bring up the Apocrypha...|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The OT is full of Messianic prophecies showing that Jesus is the Messiah!  :)   There are also future prophecies as well. <br>  <br>  The OT also gives examples of people that walked with the Lord.

Nobody is to try and keep the laws of the OT.|`|E0CZ69FYaa	I refer you to "Chris"s answer but I would say that all Scripture is still applicable to today's life even the OT. The OT shows the fall of man and that people had to sacrifice to God for their sins to be forgiven. It also points out people's inperfection and how futile it is trying to work a way to heaven. The NT shows that Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for people's sin; therefore, we have no need to sacrifice animals in the such because Jesus made salvation a gift by His death on the cross. We are save by faith in Christ.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	All scripture is given by inspiration of God

There are many other ways people choose to be judgmental. The biggest issue is can people keep their hands to themselves when feeling judgmental? My experience is they can't. I have also noticed that people who like to complain about racism are the most racist when it comes down to it but they think its ok for them and not everyone who is "against" their race in their opinion.<br>  <br>  Is racism really worse than sexism, incomism, educationism, homosexualism, heightism, weightism, drugism, or any other of the ways people choose to judge others? I think it would depend on the individual situation. If you hurt a fat person's feelings and another race's feeling by saying rude things but the fat person is hurt twice as much by your insult then where have you committed the greater wrong.<br>  <br>  Can we as a society stop judggeing others at some point in the future?

This only exasperates the problem. Forcing people to accept other people, and to assimilate with each other (which in and of itself destroys culture) only fosters more feelings of anger and resentment toward other groups. <br>  <br>  As for education, you can be an expert in someone else's culture. You can have the best understanding of someone else's beliefs, but that does not mean you have to accept it. If their culture is in direct contradiction to your culture's beliefs, no amount of education can stop you from feeling that your culture and that other culture are incompatible. A very educated friend of mine from a small rural white town had this to say when he moved to the big city for college: "I was never racist until I moved to the city." He had no problem with people of other cultures, beliefs, or races when he lived in a homogeneous society, but when he moved to the large city as was more or less forced to live side by side with people with vastly different cultures and values than him (often of different races), and they did not accept him or his culture, and he did not accept their culture, either, he began to resent them.

mVTGl6HGaa	The first use of the term was to describe all British people living in India, regardless of whether they had mixed blood or not. This usage changed to describe Anglo-Indians as people who were of mixed blood descending from the British on the male side and women from the Indian side.[2] People of mixed British and Indian descent were previously referred to as 'Eurasians' but are now more commonly referred to as 'Anglo-Indians'.[8]<br>  <br>  During the British East India Company's rule in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British officers and soldiers to take local Indian wives and have Eurasian children, due to a lack of British women in India at the time.[9][10] By the mid-19th century, there were around 40,000 British soldiers but less than 2,000 British officials present in India.[11] As British females began arriving to British India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of British officers and soldiers, intermarriage became increasingly uncommon among the British in India and was later despised after the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857,[12] after which several anti-miscegenation laws were implemented.[13][14] As a result, Eurasians were neglected by both the British and Indian populations in India.<br>  <br>  Over generations, Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. Anglo-Indian cuisine, dress, speech and religion all served to further segregate Anglo-Indians from the native population. They established a school system focused on English language and culture and formed social clubs and associations to run functions like their regular dances at occasions like Christmas and Easter.[2]<br>  <br>  Over time Anglo-Indians were specifically recruited into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, The Railways and teaching professions - but they were employed in many other fields as well. A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians. Their English language school system, their Anglocentric culture, and their Christian beliefs in particular helped bind them together.[15].<br>  <br>  Originally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, they were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of Mohammedan law outside Calcutta - and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. In 1821, a pamphlet entitled "Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons" by a "Practical Reformer," was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled "An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons." Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the "East Indian Committee" with a view to send a petition to the British Parliament for the redress of their grievances. Mr. John William Ricketts, the first noble pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of Madras, he received quite an ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian Government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.[15].<br>  <br>  Since the railway was first introduced to India, Anglo-Indians were involved with it.<br>  <br>  During the independence movement, many Anglo-Indians identified (or were assumed to identify) with British rule, and, therefore, incurred the distrust and hostility of Indian nationalists.[citation needed] Their position at independence was difficult. They felt a loyalty to a British "home" that most had never seen and where they would gain little social acceptance. (Bhowani Junction touches on the identity crisis faced by the Anglo-Indian community during the independence struggle.) They felt insecure in an India that put a premium on participation in the independence movement as a prerequisite for important government positions.<br>  <br>  Most Anglo-Indians left the country in 1947, hoping to make a new life in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Nations, such as Australia or Canada. The exodus continued through the 1950s and 1960s and by the late 1990s most had left with many of the remaining Anglo-Indians still aspiring to leave.[16]<br>  <br>  Like the Parsi community, the Anglo-Indians are essentially urban dwellers. Unlike the Parsis, the mass migrations saw more of the better educated and financially secure Anglo-Indians depart for other Commonwealth nations. [2]<br>  <br>  There has been a resurgence in celebrating Anglo-Indian culture in the 21st Century, in the form of International Anglo-Indian Reunions and in publishing books on Anglo-Indians. There have been seven reunions wit

It was not bound by the normal laws of Earth, such as needing enough space to fit everything inside it. Otherwise it would have been much larger to hold the insects alone. And it would have needed fish tanks to preserve the freshwater fish who would have died when saltwater was introduced to their environment. Then of course there's the animals who can only survive in certain climates (temperature, humidity, etc.). But like I said it was magical, so all of this was possible inside the boat. Just like Noah's ability to feed these millions of animals as well as remove their waste. These problems seem to dwarf the woodpecker issue. I'm sure God gave Noah some magical wood that could not be eaten, pecked, chewed, or chucked by any of the animals on the Ark.<br>  <br>  Or maybe it's a fairy tale for children and naive adults.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	He didn't take insects.

While I am not accusing you of sweeping generalization: I don't know to whom you are referring as regarding the fundies as the "face of Christianity." Do you mean ourselves? Do you mean foreign nations? <br>  <br>  In my neck of the US woods, I live in a predominantly Catholic area, so the face of Christianity in my reality is Catholicism. However, I will also agree that they would like to be the face as you ascertain, judging by religious-political interest groups and pressure. <br>  <br>  Do I try to get my word out there? Well I don't evangelize, (most Catholics adhere to Matthew 6 and are instructed to practice our faith in peace. When our brethren see our peace and our pleasure in faith they will hopefully ask about it. In other words we are encouraged to bring people to the faith -- when they want to be led. Not shove it down their throats. Certainly not with threats of hell fire for all eternity. I am actually getting angry as I type this.)  *Deep breath.* I do spend a lot of time here trying to act as an apologist to our faith and defend it so that bigotry does not spread. <br>  <br>  What really, truly bothers me about the current face of fundamentalist Christianity is their total and complete disregard for their past. They don't know world history, Christian history, Protestant Reformation or anything about Martin Luther. This is why Sola Scriptura is a bad idea: one is powerless of repeating mistakes of the past if they do not know their own history. One is powerless to make their own decisions or question authority if one is told they just have to trust that a single man can decipher the bible for them. Have you seen how angry they get when Catholics and Atheists alike point out that their history IS the Catholic Church? I don't think many pastors in fundamentalists churches even know this. You can always tell it's been anti-catholic night at the church service by the plethora of questions from a fundie about the Catholic Church's evil ways and false doctrine. While of course I rise up to defend it, it just makes me wonder what else they are being taught. Isn't that a frightening thought?<br>  <br>  For instance, here is a part of a speech made by Martin Luther regarding Mary:<br>  "Luther gives the Blessed Virgin the exalted position of "Spiritual Mother" for Christians:<br>  <br>  It is the consolation and the superabundant goodness of God, that man is able to exult in such a treasure. Mary is his true Mother .. (Sermon, Christmas, 1522)<br>  <br>  Mary is the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of all of us even though it was Christ alone who reposed on her knees . . . If he is ours, we ought to be in his situation; there where he is, we ought also to be and all that he has ought to be ours, and his mother is also our mother. (Sermon, Christmas, 1529)."<br>  <br>  Sorry so long, but yes, it bothers me. It bothers me that they speak so righteously, but it's of blind faith. Not leap of faith that all religion requires, but literally "blind faith." This sinner's prayer and the belief (much less the spread of) that "all you have to do is accept Jesus into your heart and you are going to heaven and with that take license to attack every other faith and or denomination of your own while you act like a condescending tool telling everyone how God judges." It seems to me that a lot of their speak is in bigotry, ignorance and lack of education of their own history, or that of other faiths. They are sheep, but not the sheep that the Good Shepherd had intended. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, of course.|`|wTfY9AmPaa	I agree that fundementalism (i feel that way for all Protesantism) is a shame but look at the bright side.

In a recorded interview with Time magazine[12] McVeigh professed his belief in "a God", although he said he had "sort of lost touch with" Catholicism and "never really picked it [back] up." The Guardian reported that McVeigh wrote a letter claiming to be an agnostic.[13] McVeigh at one time said that he believed the universe was guided by natural law, energized by some universal higher power that showed each person right from wrong if they paid attention to what was going on inside them. He had also said, "Science is my religion."[14]<br>  <br>  I think we can all agree, he was just a damn nutter.|`|AA10067344	Why people think the religion of famous or notorious people has anything to do with anything is beyond me.

Walking is the best way to lose weight.  It's free,  easy, and it makes you feel amazing.  The way I stuck to  my weightloss program is this...Mon-Thur I ate right and walked 30-60 minutes a day.  Then on Fri-Sun I ate and did what I wanted to.  It was really cool having the weekend to look forward to.  I never over did it on the weekends.  I could if I wanted to, but I was so proud of myself for all the hard work  did that week.

So I started riding my bike because that was something I enjoyed (easy because I enjoyed it so I would be less likely to slack about it) and eating better (so I limited what all was in the house to eat and drink, choices are easier when you can't really make any). Then I did some little things, like trying to walk more and move more. So if I dropped something, instead of of leaning over I'd actually get up and go get it. It also applies to trying to take the stairs instead of elevators or escalators.|`|P7phsL52aa	Yes, yes I have.

I lost my appetite totally. Like, I'd go to school with no breakfast nor lunch, come home, have a small snack maybe, and that was it. During the reconstruction of what had been affected in the house fire, which took a month, I had lost within 20lbs. I'm glad I lost that much, that I could lose that much, but from starving, I didn't think that was the best way I could've lost it. But it works, and I'm still the same size almost a year later.

It is said he had an upright, forked tail. The forked tail is symbolic of what we believe to be the appearance of the Devil. <br>  <br>  In Greek Mythology Hephastus was half goat (Zeus’ son) with cloven feet and he worked with fire.<br>  <br>  Zeus often took the appearance of a snake. Olympia (Alexander the Great’s mother) claimed Zeus took on the appearance of a snake and impregnated her.<br>  <br>  The Snake can be a deceitful or contemptible person…<br>  <br>  “Now the serpent, in the form of the tempter, of which ye read, was not made manifest in the appearance of a snake; but he is called the subtle deceiver, a serpent, because of the crooked insinuations which were made use of, through the agency of fallen angels, that had become the ministers of lustful and vile gratifications, of which ye can all witness who have ever become partakers of it, to be a bewitching, seducing spirit, calculated to lead its captives into many by and crooked paths.” (Divine Book of Holy and Eternal Wisdom; Part VI; Chapter 2:2)<br>  <br>  The word Satan just means Adversary.|`|SOlh57iKaa	Actually Satan used a serpent to speak to eve much like a ventriloquist speaks while using a puppet. But to answer your question Satan was an Angel in heaven that turned bad. Being an Angel he would have a spirit body not one of flesh and blood. Therefore the goat head with horns is inaccurate. <br>  <br>  <br>  A Sincere Bible Student<br>  H B J|`|pfNnuD5saa	Satan was actually a good looking angel. The horned fellow comes from Germanic folk tales. They all kind of merged together in Medieval times.|`|U4dHE6Kwaa	Satan can taken on many forms by transformation, possession etc!

Sort of like in some of those old WWII cartoons where you find out that Satan is also a card carrying member of the Nazi Party.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Because the early Christian church stole the images of pagan Gods to use as representatives of the devil in an effort to convert more people to their cause.  It's the same way they stole pagan holidays like Yule and Ostara to make Christmas and Easter.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	They stole this from the pagan religion in england because the god is depicted as such.
T588vfJDaa	Woaaaaaaah. I agree it's none of Oprah's business but I agree with her advice|`|n1Ga3kdYaa	How is that being a hater?<br>  <br>  A woman should stand by her man even if he beats the snots out of her? No. I don't know what planet you're living on, but that's certainly not my idea of a good relationship.<br>  <br>  if you have so many problems that you can't resolve them in a calm manner, then you need help. fast. A woman doesn't need to degrade herself by staying with a man that doesn't respect her. I'd rather wait all my life for someone else than stay with a man that hits me.<br>  <br>  Oprah is right, if a man hits you once, what makes you think he won't do it again? A man doesn't stop abusing someone over night. Therapy takes longer than a month my dear. There is some deep psychological problems in there.<br>  <br>  I don't know why you believe everyone should follow your chauvinistic ways, but most women are not out to be aggressive and independent, we just want a little respect.<br>  <br>  Change your attitude.<br>  <br>  BTW would you feel the same if it were your sister or mother?|`|0hsh000waa	No. Oprah is giving her good advice. If someone abuses you, you leave them.|`|vMJV1Jf0aa	Oprah is a lesbian, she hates men.

I'm pretty sure if it was her that beat Chris Brown your views would be totally different. Everyone has your opinion, but im not gonna lie, yours is wack!|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Stop making excuses for a thug.

IxoBFCpTaa	I go around the entire site answering questions, not just Ramadaan section.

I try remembering every single thing I learn.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't answers question that asks if something is halal or haram.

I give serious questions (like yours) serious answers.  I don't go out of my way to find answers--if I don't know, I usually won't answer--but I will look up website addresses and verify my facts if I'm unsure.  I'm pretty bad for mocking trolls and idiots, and tend towards brutal honesty (and it's the latter I get reported for most often). <br>   I compose each answer specifically for each question, and take into account the perceived personality of the asker, based on their avatar, ID, and style of typing.  I am ruthless towards people with long posts with excessive bad grammar, because I feel that you should express your question in a concise readable manner if you want real answers.  (For example, your grammar is pretty rough, but I'm not going to get on your case about it because I can still understand your question.)<br>  I also have a tendency toward profanity and being a smart aleck.  However, I can safely say that the way I answer questions here is how I answer them in real life.|`|tfkpNh89aa	I participate in many sections on Y!A, not just this one.<br>  <br>  While on here, I use searchquran.org site, islam-qa.com and also my favorite very accurate Bible site.<br>  <br>  In the food section, all answers are typed out manually because I'm an excellent cook and baker and give advice on there, unless I have to give a user a recipe of some sort.<br>  <br>  And well then, there is the family, teen, parenting section and the news section and oh yeah the pet section.....  phew..... I'm all over the place...<br>  <br>  But mainly, if I cannot use site as source, I use my life experiences and knowledge..<br>  <br>  And oh yea, I do use copy and paste when I quote the koran and hadiths and some of the Bible...|`|KKkOPwZMaa	Hahaha sis <br>  <br>  Well, I usually click on a Q that interests me then answer. If I don't know much then I research, and I might copy and paste. lol<br>  <br>  My method is the same, old, boring one.|`|075ddc678f370797a19050edaae8be18aa	Well in fact, as I read the question, I mentally draw a draft profile of the one asking the question. Sometimes, I’ll even go to his profile to see his “level of understanding”, and try to get an idea of how I may get the message(answer) to him in the best way.<br>  <br>  Besides, I have a talent- I can somehow imagine/ put myself in another person’s shoe!  And so, my answers tend to be very precise, alhamdulillaah. Needless to say that my academic background helps a lot. Also, my in-depth knowledge of some topics give me the ability to answer correctly the question posed.<br>   You know, sometimes, I don’t even need to hear the person’s question fully. I can complete it. Ya, you have well understood. I can guess what’s the question about! So, i’m always very rapid at answering(oral). <br>  <br>  Besides, to be able to remember many things, I do not actually remember them by heart, but instead remember them by a keyword. I index all my knowledge in my head. Therefore, if somone needs the reference to lets say a quranic verse, I just go to Islamicity’s Quran Search, and type in the keyword I have in memory. In fact, I mentally index almost everything I need to remember. Somewhat like.... a computer! You may find this weird or strange, but its true!<br>  <br>  One more thing! Very often, I simulate questions by muyself, and auto-provide the answers. i do this for common questions I may have from non-muslims. Like, "Whay are men allowed to marry 4 times". these are common and very typical questions. So, I mentally have the answer ever ready!! :)<br>  <br>  Thats my secrets!! :) But nomore to the people reading this post of mine!! :D|`|FhXzlnDOaa	You are methodical, huh?  Did that help you earn your badge?<br>  <br>  Me...I just answer whatever jumps out at me, honestly, my own words usually backed up with quotes, once in a while trading a few words with Thaan Noon (Peace Raw!).

Suffering began with Adam and Eve. God allows us as humans to see that humans can't govern themselves without him. Jer 10:23 says that "to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step". God does set out guidelines to help us avoid suffering, but it is up to us to follow those guidelines.            2 Timothy 3:16,17 tells us "All scriptures is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work." We also have to keep in mind to the scripture at Ecclesiastes 9:11 which tells us that " time and unforseen occurence befall us all". God hasn't deviated from his origional purpose. Suffering will end as brought out in Revelation 21:4 where it say "And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away."|`|AA11570675	the Bible shows 2 things from the outset 1) that God handed rule of the earth over to mankind & 2) that by sin we've messed it up - everything. <br>  That's the message of the first few chapters of Genesis which is essentially the prologue to the Bible - the story of God's redemtion of mankind from death which is the worst consequence of sin.<br>  God hasn't chosen to take control back from mankind. When God gives a gift, he gives it for good - or evil. So we have a battle between good & evil, both of which take on some personality in the spiritual world which influences ours. So we're constantly under attack but the difficult bit is we can't see our enemy.<br>  Instead of wresting back control, God has chosen to take on the consequence of this himself. In order to do this, death - which is right & just for all sinners had to sin for itself by killing one who was not sinful. So God himself became a man, got killed but death couldn't hold him. So now death itself can die & ultimately will have to.<br>  In the meantime we've still got to live here with all the fallout from this war, including suffering & death, until God puts an end to the present order of things. That bit is shown in the epilogue to the Bible which is Revelation & is promised to be fulfilled at the right time.|`|CRDl9nffaa	Oh dear.

But the house and the apartment building these places what the people can live in these places. And the money what the people can wants to buy for the mortgage and/or non-mortgage to buy food, clothings and all types of access.

mXsWyVueaa	True "atheism" is a complete lack of belief, yet about 90% of the people on here that call themselves "atheist" are in fact "secular humanists," which is a religion.<br>  <br>  The dictionary defines religion as:<br>  <br>  "1. A specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects, 2. The body of persons adhering to a particular set of beliefs and practices, and 3. Something one believes in and follows devotedly; a point or matter of ethics or conscience" (Dictionary.com)<br>  <br>  These definitions do not restrict religion to believing in a supernatural being. Thus, Humanism, which can be defined by a certain set of beliefs, practices, and ethics, fits very nicely in the niche of religion.<br>  <br>  It is errant to believe that religion can and must only be defined by a belief in a deity or supernatural forces. One person can have a totally different set of beliefs than anyone in existence and believe in such forces, but that does not make that person's beliefs a religion, because religion is more strongly related to a community of people that hold the same beliefs.<br>  <br>  Humanists generally all agree that the worth of people is based on their ability to determine right and wrong based on human qualities. Logic and rationality are foremost in Humanist thought. Humanists believe what is seen and what can be deduced using intelligence and logic. They believe in the search for truth and reject ideas of supernatural and spiritual explanations for anything. Humanists are nearly universal in this thinking. To them, there is no afterlife, there is simply life.<br>  <br>  The religion of Humanism can be seen as replacing gods with man, morals with political correctness, and miracles with science. Changing a few basic ideas, Humanism still maintains a set of beliefs to define the world and human interaction just like any other religion. Humanists are no less devote in there beliefs than any other religion in the world, with strong adherents and even Humanist leaders that could be seen as "prophets" or great teachers.<br>  <br>  Because Humanists beliefs can be generalized among all Humanists, even the fact that there is a term for them and their beliefs, shows that they do fall under the term religion. By a Humanist's own means of looking at the world, logic, it can be shown undeniably that Humanism is a religion.|`|kdRalNpvaa	ive never actually gotten that statement either.<br>  im a christian and if you really look into the bible.<br>  it explains so much about these days.<br>  :)|`|AA11232725	Atheism is obviously not a "religion" in the traditional sense of the word. Nevertheless, it does contain many components of religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  1. It's faith based since Atheists believe that God does not exist when that cannot be proved and there is substantial evidence to support the idea of a divine Creator.<br>  <br>  2. Based upon this faith in "no God", Atheism promotes a world view that impacts all areas of life where belief in a God would also impact them. Morality, the purpose for life, what we can expect after we die, and many other areas of how a person views them self are all dependent upon whether or not someone has faith in a God or gods.|`|DzGKfdKnaa	Its a worldview.|`|U51pBeLfaa	Look at Chinese communism.

From the outside they are denominations within the religion of atheism.<br>  <br>  There are Christians who say "I am not religious I just Praise the Lord" What they mean is that they are not affiliated with organized religion. It does not mean that they are not religious.<br>  <br>  Some atheists proclaim that all religions are irrational.

If you come through this you will actually be the stronger, especially if you trust in God.<br>  <br>  The LORD God is real and He is true. What we have to do is read and absorb His inspired word, the Bible. We have to pray sincerely to God for His help in this. We cannot do these things alone but we must always turn to God and ask Him to increase our faith.<br>  <br>  "Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God." The wonderful thing is that the Scriptures show us that there is salvation. On our part we have to repent, be baptised in water and come up out of it to a new way of life. A life dedicated to sering God<br>  <br>  This perhaps sounds too difficult for you at the moment. But faith will come if you let it, the disciples never had it easy and Jesus certainly didn't.

Currently when we hear about terrorism it is often about Islamic extremists but there is no rule that terrorists come from any specific background or religion. In the United States the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City was done by a terrorist who was a Christian (although a very extreme sect) and was an American Citizen. During the Revolutionary War England thought of the citizens in the American colonies as terrorists because they fought against their mother country. In the United States those very people are called patriots and the founding fathers of the nation. Sometimes the word is used correctly and sometimes it is really a matter of perspective and which viewpoint you side with between two groups. But terrorism is definitely not exclusive to a religion.|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	A terrorist can become a Christian if he gives his heart to Jesus<br>  Christ.  This is why in Matthew 13:36 when you read the parable of the tares of the field, we are told to not disturb or pull them up, but let them alone and at the end the Angels will gather them up and burn them.  Thats because they have the opportunity to change and become the children of the Living God, if they so choose.<br>  <br>  Many who are terrorists of Islam, will continue on that path.  Many<br>  who practice Islam would be killed if they publically say they wish to<br>  convert to Christianity - so even if they do, most of them would keep<br>  quiet about it.  The whole thing disgusts me and you can be real<br>  cutsie here with this question where obviously your whole dumb intention was to crack wise against President Bush, but just remember that it was that man who has kept your dumb asss safe for the past 7+ years and now you have your Messiah who is going on<br>  Arab tv apologizing for America, cutting our defense money AND WEAPONS in half, talking about dumping our defense system, talking about ending our space defenses, weapons and Satillites so he can<br>  pay for his dumb socialist programs, and that means that your arrogant little asss will be a sitting duck when these Islamic nutjobs<br>  come a-callin'.

To be a christian means to be like Christ, or to strive to walk in the footsteps of Christ. Christ was a man of love not terrorism.<br>  Christ condemn violence and taught his disciples to have love for their fellow man regardless of race (Luke 10:27). Therefore one would not qualify as a christian if he fail to follow the example set by Christ, although that person may claim to be a christian.

The Baptism itself will not save you or make you a Christian. The world today is full of Hypocrites and we all know that. We always are looking for an excuse to make ourselves look OK in our "bad deeds". That is not Christianity and it is condemned by Jesus who will tell them one day..."I don't know you..."<br>  Matthew 7 :21-23<br>  21Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br>  <br>   22Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>  <br>   23And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <br>  <br>  It takes more than saying I am a Christian or getting baptized or accepting Jesus.

AA11232725	It's the result of a process that started in the middle of the 1900's when secular humanists armed with Darwinian propaganda and aided by a turning away from traditional morality to drugs and sex and selfishness made it popular to think of the Christian religion as a worn out superstition that intelligent people had no need for.<br>  <br>  As a result parents stopped going to church or sending their children to church. Sex and drugs and rock and roll was the battle cry of the 80's which followed on the heels of the "turn on, tune in, and drop out" message of the late 60's and 70's. When people started getting depressed grunge rock and punk rock catered to that mind set. <br>  <br>  But God is well able to preserve a remnant for Himself and to turn sinners from the error of their ways. It goes in cycles. People turn away from God, seek to be the ultimate authority in their lives, fall into sinful rebellion, and then when the "chickens come home to roost" as it were, they run back to their loving Creator who in His mercy forgives them like in the parable of the Prodigal Son in Luke 15.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	It's the "great apostasy" it's been prophesied in the Bible and those who are aware of what is happening now and what has been spoken of concerning this from the bible understand that this is one of the things that must be before the ascension of the beast. <br>  There is a lot more to it than that but basically; the downturn in religions across the states and the world is called "the great apostasy".|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I'm going to answer assuming that you mean Christianity, because that's what most people mean when they say religion.  Other religions are actually growing.<br>  <br>  Because of the fact that information is more readily available to people now, people are discovering that there is more than one religion in the world. Twenty years ago, someone in Kansas or Nebraska may never have heard of anything besides Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, which only would have been described in very derogatory ways. With the internet, people in even the most remote places now realize that there are thousands of different religions in the world, and they may be finding ones that suit them much better than Christianity. Besides just the spreading of information, there is the fact that it is no longer dangerous, in most places in the US to be openly involved in a non-Christian religion. Just twenty years ago, some people of other religions would have been in mortal danger had their neighbors known. People are no longer afraid to either change religions or not have one at all. With the spreading of information, we are also learning that scientific theories with mountains of evidence completely contradict the Bible. They no longer believe that it could be infallible. <br>  <br>  Perhaps most importantly, the Christian church is driving people away. Women are considered second-class citizens. Gay, bi, and trans people are constantly being told that they're going to hell. Church-goers are taught not to ask questions. Christian hymns are filled with phrases "a wretch like me." They are taught that science is wrong about everything. They're being told to actively discriminate against people of other religions. They are encouraged to vote their own religion into law, even when it violates the rights of others. Everyone, no matter how good, is going to hell if they aren't in the right church in the right religion. Many churches are still racist. As people learn more about the world, they appreciate less and less to be taught to hate the people around them.<br>  <br>  People are literate now. The ability to read is almost universal in the US. Many people leave the church after reading the Bible. Have you read it? The Biblical god encouraged genocide, war, slavery, the murder of disobedient children, and when he demanded that the Israelites massacre their neighbors to get the promised land for themselves, he instructed that even the babies were to be killed.

It wasnt that anyone can think what they want...it was more of a "why dont you beleive the truth." I went to church and school and never really understood that there may not really be a god. I always assumed that that was a commonly held fact, and for whatever reason some people chose not believe what was obviously the truth. But I now realize that was because I was brought up in a way that was intended to make me think this way...it was not accidental. It is like a great con artist...people always say, buthe seemed so trustworthy. That is why he is such a good con artist...you are unable to tell whether or not he is lying. That is why it works so well.<br>  <br>  But once I started to doubt (I am now an atheist going on 5 years or so), 100 channels on tv, the internet and access to info about anything anytime, realizing that there is more to life than following the generally accepted way things are supposed to work because so many people do it, Yahoo Answers R&S section, books, and the number of surveys coming out saying hey, there are more people who dont believe than you may have thought...you are not that weird to not believe. <br>  Information and easy cheap access to that information.|`|gLMhG9fVaa	I was going to ask this<br>  <br>  I think its ties in with the rise in people that believe they are entitled to whatever they want<br>  <br>  media indoctrination from people like bill mahar<br>  <br>  the idea that Our own understanding of science is absolute and there is "no way we can be wrong"<br>  <br>  things in the world that are bad and "if all this is so bad then there can be no god"<br>  <br>  and honestly just what people are exposed to and they see evangelical christians acting like zealots and doing the wrong thing then they blame religion not the person.|`|3GO5k5nNaa	Its more of a decline in Christinity.<br>  <br>  Islam is on the rise in the US and is the fastest growing religion.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	9/11.

JCGtfNeTaa	The Bible does NOT say that plants can talk. Judges chapter 9 gives a parable about talking trees. A parable is a short figurative story that illustrates a moral attitude or religious principle. It is not a literal account of an actual event.<br>  <br>  You are grasping at straws. You are building up a straw man just to knock it down. This is known as a straw-man argument. To make your opponent appear to say something that he never said, just so that you can refute it. You are making a false claim, and then you try to refute your false claim.<br>  <br>  Your allegation makes as much sense for someone to claim that civilization today is stupid because they believe that animals fall from the sky, based upon the commonly-used phrase, "It's raining cats and dogs".<br>  <br>  Please take your trolling elsewhere.<br>  <br>  ADDITION:<br>  <br>  Just as I thought, no further response!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I believe the bible, and in the bible a snake talked and a donkey talked.

gDVQNMR7aa	Seems to me the doctors who impregnated the Octo Mom should be banned from practicing medicine.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	i dont think anyone should have that many children|`|yHfsHp6naa	No, but I think that our tax code could be amended to discourage irresponsible breeding.|`|LeaUjOoUaa	Are you really advocating a limitation on reproduction? We are not China. Also, if the person in question is not a Christian and has 13+ children, are they permitted? How exactly would you manage this ban? Would we have forced sterilization? Forced abortions for those that jump the arbitrary line for reproduction. Do we require those that want to reproduce to register for a baby license? What you are suggesting is just ridiculous. People have their freedoms and their own rights that you cannot infringe upon.<br>  I think it is important that people have children responsibly and be able to care for the children they have. And also, the differences between the Octomom and the Duggars is vast. The Duggers believe that they should allow God to manage their family for them. They do not prevent pregnancy. Key to this is also the fact that they are also not going to a clinic to force a pregnancy either, such as the Octomom has done repeatedly. <br>  The Duggars appear to be a very responsible family. They live in a home large enough to provide for their family. They have an income large enough to support the family they have and they are good stewards of their money. They are not in debt, they spend sensibly, and they do not look for the government for a hand out to support their family. How many people with even far fewer children than they have, can make the same claim? <br>  I would think it would be appropriate to have a system that is more rewarding for those who cannot afford children to refrain from doing so and not providing a free ride to those who cannot provide for themselves and their children. Make it difficult to be a person who acts in such ways.|`|uurTX7POaa	all Christians have that many kids ? you do not say... I say kill all Atheists BEFORE they multiply, do I have the right to say that ? <br>  You make me sick...|`|cXXJVz64aa	I think society should look down at anyone having more than 4 kids due to the use of resources!|`|c0f6bd3b726b4f3a16f21d6f8759e7abaa	first and foremost the Oct mom is a totally different story. She expect citizens of Cali or America to care for her kids while she get's back on her feet. Not to mention that she receive food stamps and paid for fertility treatments with student loan money. She thinks she is qualify not to be wrong in her part to bring kids in this world that she can not take care of. In situations like these women should be banned to not have kids they cannot care for when they try to have them on purpose.<br>  <br>  2nd,<br>  <br>  the duggars have the mental, psychical compass to care for their kids. They do not receive government assistance, they are not in any debt, they own everything they own and they do not believe in credit cards and debt. They take care of their own kids and have a ample enough space for their family. They own 3 cars and their home was bought out of cash. They own 7 real estate commercial properties.<br>  <br>  Do I have a problem with this no, because I'm not paying for it. A woman should bare as many kids as she can allowed or god allowed and afford. In this case the duggars have a well rounded respectable family in which they can afford and take care of.<br>  <br>  Many women do not believe in having that many kids because they can't afford them are they don't have the time for them, or just don't want to make time for them. They believe that kids are expensive and also may believe that having that many kids will drive them crazy. But for the strong women who have the patience and gratitude to bare as many kids they can afford and have the time for are really super hero's. Most women believe having 1 or 2 kids get an education and a job and replacing their time with their kids with toys and accessories.. Rather then taking care of them instead of letting daycare or nannies take care of their kids. Now someone women can't help this but the ones who know they can stay at home with their kids don't because they rather work and worry about material things. <br>  <br>  The duggars are great people and in fact Michell has a degree and a high school education she just rather raise her kids and take part in their live rather than someone else. One thing to remember you only have one chance to raise your kids.<br>  <br>  One more question what does religion have to do with this. Besides living in a communist country I believe women all over the world have as many kids they want. I don't think it has anything to do with religion. Christians don't believe in birth control if that is what you mean!|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	Actually, I think Christians and all other religious believers should be sterilized at birth so they don't spread their inferior genetic material further into the gene pool than they already have.

This is a trend, meant to be applied to a large group as opposed to individuals.  Of course, the area of study tends to play a role as well.  Art, music, literature and other liberal arts tend not to really challenge a person's belief structures, however geology, astronomy, physics, biology and other sciences tend not only to challenge beliefs, but they also train cognitive skills like critical and analytical thinking, evidence evaluation, and others.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	When I went to college I was a Baptist.

If you are strong in your faith, and you know what you believe, then nothing willcause you to falter that. Religion is much more than just history. Many Christians do not take literally the Bible, but merely take it for what it should be - a guide and a storybook representing the origins of the religion. But not a history book. People attending liberal arts colleges who wish to remain religious can do so by simply having their own faith in their own ways. Just because they are expanding their minds in the way of history or world religion or philosophy does not mean that they will change their faith. I think it is very possible to be very spiritual and religious while going to college and learning about the world without compromising my beliefs.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Easy. Know who you are, be open to their ideas, but don't just buy what they tell you hook-line-and-sinker.<br>  <br>  I'm not a believer, but grew up in a fairly conservative house hold. My parents are both registered Republicans...but they are atheists.<br>  <br>  They raised me to think for myself, and not to simply buy what someone told me, no matter who they are. So I have that attitude toward life in general.<br>  <br>  I remain open minded, but get information from several sources, then I decide how I feel or think about a particular subject.<br>  <br>  And contrary to popular belief, while it's true colleges do tend to be more liberal, that doesn't mean that ALL the teachers and professors are. Just look around for a school you like, and don't worry about how "liberal" the campus is. If you know yourself, and aren't easily swayed by others, you'll be just fine.<br>  <br>  But keep in mind too, that college is your first time away from your parents, and many people grow and change a lot in that time. So even if you, or someone you know does change, that doesn't mean some "evil liberal" professor is responsible.|`|entRyNolaa	the nonbeliever does not get to choose.<br>  I call it "inevitableism".<br>  The doubt leads them to a place of total imprisonment, and they can only choose non belief based on the limited and shallow results of proof, evidence, human reality, and science, and mostly.......non want.....etc|`|cXXJVz64aa	Usually once a person becomes well educated with non-religious courses, they realize the flaws of religion, and drop it.|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	For the same reason that G.W.

After all it is hard to overcome beliefs that have been ingrained into you since birth.|`|NBJF2UcBaa	i am Muslim . i believe that Islam is the only religion that respects the needs of the humanbeing  it doesnt tell you not to marry or not to eat or some other things that you have to do in other religions .Islam wants the world to live in peace and happiness some people think that the veil that women have to wear in Islam makes the woman feel uncomfortable and sad but this is not true.in Islam woman is like a diamond you cant leave a valuable diamond left in the street anyone can touch it or hold it if you have a valuable diamond you have to cover it this is the same as woman .she is valuable so you have to protect her from the eyes of the people.the nearest religoin to Islam is christianity . i belive in christianity but i think that it was a religion just like islam but people changed its principles i belive that christianity said that God is one and that jesus is his prophet but people changed it and changed the bible until we had this bible in our hands.please dont take this personally i am just expressing my beliefs .|`|0c7afeab4d0a2cffaae3b6f595659888aa	I'm not I'm a human.<br>  <br>  Gasp ...I accept Jesus as my saviour...<br>  <br>  Now I'm a Christian.

Born into a Protestant home, baptized as a child, mother became a born again christian. In my late teens became an atheist, early 20's became a spiritualist and finally in my early 30's became a Muslim.<br>  Why?<br>  Because I had grown up in a Multi cultural city and known people of many faiths and was class mates, neighbours, family friends and collegues with Hindu's, Catholics, Sikhs, Mormons, Christians, Muslims, Jehovous Witnesses, Jews etc etc etc <br>  So when I moved to a place that was not so multi cultural and in the current climate of opinon of Muslims, I heard so many degrading things about Muslims and so much hate towards people who they did not know or have ever experience living with.<br>  I would think to myself they are not describing a single Muslim I have ever known. As a child I was always welcome in my Muslim neighours home, they where always generous, sweet and giving people. The best neighbours anyone could wish for. My parents being white Protestants where always invited to weddings etc and treated with nothing but respect and love.<br>  So I though well they are not describing Muslim I know so many its something in the Quran that I dont know of that is causing all this anamosity. So I bought a Quran and started reading for myself and became so overwhelmed with what I read I felt I had found the true path and just knew I was going to become a Muslim.<br>  Why? Because I just felt it was right for me, I felt this is my purpose in life to worship God as he wants to be worshipped. If you had asked me did I ever think I would be a Muslim, the answer would have been no, I have nothing against Muslims its just not for me. But there you go, isnt life funny?

EYqTV2EYaa	If today is your birthday, then Happy Birthday! As for your question, nothing is wrong at all about wanting time and recognition for you birthday, and you did a great thing buying other people gifts and making their birthdays great. However, simply because you helped people out doesn't mean you should expect the same treatment in return. Trust me, it would be VERY nice if you've gotten the same treatment, nonetheless, it doesn't always work that way. I mean, the true definition of generosity in my book is to help people out and give them things, even if they wouldn't give something in return or not care because like I said, it doesn't always happen. See, in your mindset, you're probably the type that would do something nice for someone that didn't a nice thing for you, which is probably why you're upset and hurt. That's not being selfish, for you're only following a basic mindset that nearly every human follows. I'm sorry you had to feel that way, but don't feel bad. See, if you can keep your cool and realize people have different mindsets pertaining to being 'selfish' or 'generous,' you wouldn't feel upset and hurt, you would realize the thing that matters is that you did a great thing at other birthdays, then you wouldn't be upset anymore and have a great birthday.<br>  <br>  EDIT: By the way, what is that in your avatar's mouth? lol.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	i dont see that as selfish. its ok for you to feel this way especially when you go out of your way to to pay for gifts with your money for those people birthdays.<br>  but next time make a party with ur friends. Before your party if you at the mall n dont have money or looking in a mag. then tell them omg i so want that! <br>  thats a clue for them. (dont make it expensive though)|`|ZOYyfBFYaa	Of course it is not wrong of you to want a little attention. You have been a good friend with giving the gifts and attention, why shouldn't you deserve some back? From a personal experience, my supposedly "best friend" forgot to get me a present or say happy birthday to me.<br>  <br>  The thing in the avatar's mouth is a heart or a kiss|`|e4aF8tdPaa	no its not. its nice to go out on your birthday you know. but hey if no body wants to do anything, treat yourself to something and just forget about everyone else. (if it is your birthday....HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
2A6AQGeHaa	You can't.  Fact is people today are so far removed from the time, location, and culture of what the scriptures were actually written for that it's like trying to play a song written for the violin with a harpsichord.

If you're taking artwork from the 1500's as gospel, then, you're right -- it's confusing.<br>  <br>  But any intelligent historian or even layman can understand that what an artist paints 1500 years after an event is not the same as what's described by eyewitnesses to the actual event.<br>  <br>  In fact, historians have shown that the Romans used the captial T cross, the lowercase T cross, and the X cross.|`|4BPYNiKVaa	it is hard to talk about accuracy, I mean he was just a carpenter then fisherman before history was split into "before" and "after" him, and still talking about him after 2000 years, I am sure it is a coincidence, and not an accurate one|`|XKzUsb7zaa	The Bible says crucified on a cross.

This force will be captured in the clouds or the atmosphere. Eventually it will rain and this water will be accumulated and processed and eventually made potable. Some person or animal will receive this water for consumption which will assist in the digestive process and you will eventually become crap.<br>  <br>  Centuries later someone will dig up your grave and open to see what artifacts you were buried with and say, "Hey, check out this crap!!!" not realizing that truer words have never been spoken.<br>  <br>  Have a crappy day, and I mean this in the nicest of ways.|`|VEDZrnpcaa	yep. the spanish inquisition.<br>  <br>  bet you weren't expecting that were you.<br>  <br>  no one ever expects the spanish inquisition.|`|qp5EFetJaa	Just empty space, but it's being filled with the expanding universe.|`|xr6hivGdaa	the universe is never ending it goes on forever supposedly..

For Conrad pronounce the c softly from your throat and the o should be pronounced like you say o when you say the alphabet not like a short a.  For R?ntgen the r is from the back of your throat and then just like the english spelling <Roentgen> pronouncing every letter subtly.|`|PZGpFzTsaa	It's kind of hard to type. <br>  <br>  <br>  rowntkin  . . . . . sorta|`|RuUawJ8Saa	Since you don't speak German, I would simplify the pronunciation a little. German is very phonetic, i.e. you say every letter so I would pronounce it "runt-gun". The "u" in "runt" isn't exactly equivalent to ? but it is closer enough for a presentation which is otherwise in English. If you can roll the "r", even better!|`|Am1JsWmAaa	It's hard to say because ? is not in your alphabet. ? is pronounced like when people say "eeeeem" if they are unsure what to say, the long e-sound is pronounced close to an ?. So something like reee(mm)wntken|`|Mj8ojDMMaa	its something like this<br>  r??ntg??n|`|UFtSDTlSaa	r-OOnt-g-en<br>  The umlauted o (?) is like the English "o" sound, but you press your tongue against the back of your lower teeth when you say it.  The rest is pretty similar to how you would pronounce it in English.
OZjlW5utaa	WRONG SECTION!!!
S4XUl7qWaa	No you don't. I never did after 5th grade, and it was my right. I did catch some flack for it though. Took some time to explain to my fellow students and teachers that patriotism (loving your country, which I do) is not the same thing as nationalism (blindly reciting compulsory loyalty oaths for fear people will think you aren't patriotic, which I don't do).|`|Znw52fxkaa	Despite it's use of the word god, it is a pledge of allegiance for your country - not religion. Just ignore the world god, or change it to something you feel more comfortable with and take part. Or you could probably choose not to take part...or simply stand without saying the words.<br>  <br>  I have to attend a couple of religious ceremony's throughout the year because of something I take part in, I too am atheist, whenever they mention god, I just spend my time thinking about something unreligious, for me it's a time to reflect on things and renew my lack of belief.|`|86PUxs1jaa	You should at least stand, to show a bit of respect for the USA (unless you're an anarchist, as well as an atheist), but you don't have to actually recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  I've always been a bit of a patriot so I used to just skip the "under God" part.  <br>  <br>  Addendum:  "perdylilpeaches"  I essentially agree with you.  However, I am not a Canadian and refusing to stand for the pledge in the USA is generally considered a serious sign of blatant disrespect.  If I'd tried that, back in the fifties and sixties, my male peers would have literally beaten the crap out of me.  I presume it's much the same today, so standing silently is a reasonable compromise.  That's what all the JW's did back when I was a student.|`|POzCKBzvaa	Just reading some of these answers... it's ridiculous to think that if you don't stand for this speech that you hate your country. They say that and then say, on some countries they force you to believe certain things, etc. Do they not see the similarity between the two?? If Americans are so "free" to believe what they want than it shouldn't matter if you stand or not. <br>  A friend of mine while growing up didn't stand during the national anthem because she was a Jehovah's Witness and got so much flack for it. That doesn't seem like freedom of belief to me. <br>  <br>  Glad Canada got rid of the pledge of allegiance when I was in the first grade.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	The Pledge is about patriotism and respect for our country.  If you hate America, the good news is that you get to leave.<br>  <br>  You COULD stand and not say "under God."<br>  <br>  Be thankful you live in a country where this is an option.  In some countries, you are forced to believe in certain things and are executed if you don't.|`|TOm0lawCaa	No, you will be arrested and handed over the secret service.<br>  <br>  Seriously, the pledge of allegiance is about patriotism, not religion.

There is certainly something wrong if a vast swathe of a population study a language for 14 years and still don't know  some of the grammatical and vocabulary basics.  There's people who have shown themselves   capable of learning many foreign languages  who struggle to master it from their formal schooling.<br>  The system is a shambles and has been for generations by now.

FgRUdQOBaa	The Catholic is absolutely positively against the death penalty.<br>  There are some Catholics that are personally in favor of the death penalty but it is in complete opposition to the teachings of the Church and of Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  We respect all life, and it is not something we are allowed to pick and choose, that is for God to decide.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	I'm not pro-death penalty.  Murdering murderers is not civilized behavior.  What's next?  Raping rapists?|`|YnGIccE8aa	We are not pro-death penalty. Who told you that?|`|AA11796124	At issue in both cases is protecting the life of the innocent.<br>  <br>  The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches:<br>  <br>  ABORTION<br>  2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: <br>  <br>  You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. <br>  <br>  God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. <br>  <br>  2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society.<br>  <br>  2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a "criminal" practice (GS 27 § 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. <br>  <br>  2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. <br>  <br>  Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."<br>  <br>  DEATH PENALTY<br>  2267 Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. <br>  If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person. <br>  <br>  Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm - without definitely taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself - the cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity "are very rare, if not practically non-existent."|`|AA11520296	I'm not Catholic, I'm Methodist, but I'm against taking all life.

That would be wrong to say )|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Cardinal Bernardin espoused official Catholic teaching of the <br>  "Seamless garment of the sanctity of Human Life ethic."<br>  That means that life is sacred from Conception to Natural Death.<br>  The only justification for killing is in the case of self-defense.<br>  This means there can be some exceptions:<br>  Abortion of an ectopic pregnancy to save the mother.<br>  Using deadly force against a dangerous attacker.<br>  A just war in the case of defending a nation against terrorists.<br>  Use of pain-killers even if they shorten life.<br>  The death penalty, when prisoners cannot be safely detained.

I have a interstate commute and there are crazy people out there.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	I wear The Miraculous Medal of Mary.<br>  <br>   The Meaning of the Front Side<br>  of the Miraculous Medal<br>  Mary is standing upon a globe, crushing the head of a serpent beneath her foot. She stands upon the globe, as the Queen of Heaven and Earth. Her feet crush the serpent to proclaim Satan and all his followers are helpless before her (Gn 3:15). The year of 1830 on the Miraculous Medal is the year the Blessed Mother gave the design of the Miraculous Medal to Saint Catherine Labouré. The reference to Mary conceived without sin supports the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary—not to be confused with the virgin birth of Jesus, and referring to Mary's sinlessness, “full of grace” and “blessed among women” (Luke 1:28)—that was proclaimed 24 years later in 1854. <br>  <br>  The twelve stars can refer to the Apostles, who represent the entire Church as it surrounds Mary. They also recall the vision of Saint John, writer of the Book of Revelation (12:1), in which “a great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of 12 stars.” The cross can symbolize Christ and our redemption, with the bar under the cross a sign of the earth. The “M” stands for Mary, and the interleaving of her initial and the cross shows Mary’s close involvement with Jesus and our world. In this we see Mary’s part in our salvation and her role as mother of the Church. The two hearts represent the love of Jesus and Mary for us. (See also Lk 2:35).<br>  <br>  `````````````<br>  <br>  Our Blessed Mother Mary spoke to St. Catherine: “Have a medal struck upon this model. Those who wear it will receive great graces, especially if they wear it around the neck.”<br>  <br>  The Miraculous Medal is not a “good-luck charm”. Rather, it is a great testimony to faith and the power of trusting prayer. Its greatest miracles are those of patience, forgiveness, repentance, and faith. God uses a Medal, not as a sacrament, but as an agent, an instrument, in bringing to pass certain marvelous results. “The weak things of this earth hath God chosen to confound the strong.”|`|l3f8kf7xaa	I used to wear a brown scapular.

I wear it to bed, I wear it all day and all night.  It is far more important than wearing a medal because Our Lady promised that whosoever dies wearing the scapular shall not suffer the fires of hell.  You must be enrolled in the scapular by a priest first in order for it to benefit you.  And the scapular you do wear must not have any plastic covering of any kind.  Those are invalid.

Besides, I know he'll be named a saint, someday, too, and he was such a major player in the pro-life movement, and I really respected him.|`|xxEhpytpaa	The cloth Scapular is very powerful and should be worn at all times. My whole family wears one. It was given to St Simon Stalk by our Blessed Mother and the promise is that if you wear the brown Scapular all the time you will never suffer the fires of hell. It doesn't mean that you won't have to spend some time in purgatory, for if you need purification you will have to spend time there, but you will eventually get to heaven. There is more, at Fatima when our Lady appeared to the three children She added more to the promise. If you wear the Brown Scapular faithfully and pray the Rosary daily and go to confession, mass and receive our Lord in the Most Blessed Sacrament and spend at least 15 min. with our Lady when saying the Rosary that day, on the 5 consecutive first Saturday's of the month, the promise is: Our Blessed Mother will escort you into heaven on the first Saturday of you death (if you are in purgatory). This alone should make us want to wear this piece of material, for it is very powerful. And if you are enrolled in the Brown Scapular, you need not get it blessed to wear it. If you are not enrolled you must get it blessed. If you want any more info on it please feel free to email me I will be glad to help.

I3rjYVUFaa	Genesis 5:3 And Adam lived 130 years, and begot Seth<br>  Genesis 5:6 Seth lived 105 years, and begot Enosh<br>  Genesis 5:9 Enosh lived 90 years, and begot Cainan<br>  Genesis 5:12 Cainan lived 70 years, and begot Mahalalel<br>  Genesis 5:15 Mahalalel lived 65 years, and begot Jared<br>  Genesis 5:18 Jared lived 162 years, and begot Enoch<br>  Genesis 5:21 Enoch lived 65 years, and begot Methuselah<br>  Genesis 5:25 Methuselah lived 187 years, and begot Lamech<br>  Genesis 5:28 Lamech lived 182 years, and begot Noah<br>  Genesis 5:32 Noah lived 500 years, and begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth<br>  Genesis 11:10 Shem lived 100 years, and begot Arphaxad 2 years after the Flood<br>  <br>  Add all these up and you get 1,654 years from Adam until the Flood + 2 years and Arphaxad was born. We continue in Genesis 11:12 Arphaxad lived 35 years, and begot Shelah<br>  Genesis 11:14 Selah lived 30 years, and begot Eber<br>  Genesis 11:16 Eber lived 34 years, and begot Peleg<br>  Genesis 11: 18 Peleg lived 30 years, and begot Reu<br>  Genesis 11:20 Reu lived 32 years, and begot Serug<br>  Genesis 11:22 Serug lived 30 years, and begot Nahor<br>  Genesis 11:24 Nahor lived 29 years, and begot Terah<br>  Genesis 11:26 Terah lived 70 years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br>  (Abram's name was later changed by God to Abraham--see Genesis 17:5) So, if you add up these numbers, you get 290 years from the flood to Abraham.<br>  Now, if you skip over to Matthew 1:17, you will see that it was 14 generations from Abraham to David, 14 generations from <br>  David to Deportation to Babylon, and 14 generations from Bablylon to Messiah. This is 42 generations from Abraham to Jesus. If we make an assumption of 36 years per generation, this places Jesus birth at 1,512 years after Abraham.<br>  So, to summarize, we have 1,654 years from the beginning (Adam) to the Flood, then 290 years to Abraham, then 1,512 years (give or take a week) from Abraham to Jesus. Jesus was born in 4 BC, so from then til now is 2,013 years. This adds up to 5,467 years for the age of the earth; based on an assumption of 36 years per generation. You can rerun the figures with a strict Biblical 40 years per generation, but you don't get millions or billions. Those numbers are reserved for Congress and evolutionists.<br>  <br>  Come to think of it, billions are no longer enough for Congress.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	Most of the dating is based on conjecture. Genesis provides lists of years down to the captivity in Egypt. Scholars noticed that one of the names of the cities built by the Hebrews was "Ramses," so they assumed that the Exodus took place during the reign of Ramses. Counting backwards led them to a date of c. 4000 BC for the creation. Using that method also happened to give accurate dates for the ancient Babylonian Empire, but nobody knew about that until fairly recently. <br>  <br>  But even if you take the Bible literally, there are problems. The city called "Ramses" in Goshen was actually built centuries before the actual Ramses (who only expanded some of the public buildings and renamed the town). Also, the date of 430 years for the period of the Exodus is based on a letter of Paul, and may very well have been a symbolic reference. And then there is the problem that Jewish genealogies (including both genealogies provided for Jesus in the NT) frequently listed only the more famous ancestors, and did not necessarily include everyone. Genesis, for example, omits Canaan (I believe), who was listed in Luke's genealogy, as well as the Septuagint.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	It was a bishop who's name escapes me at the moment who worked out by looking at the various families and people quoted in the old testament and the ages given that god created the world in 4004 BC.

Rather, there is no such thing as energy - just as there is no such thing as matter. Both of these terms can be transformed (the formula is already listed by other answerers) - so it is not really valid to talk about matter and energy separately.<br>  <br>  As far as our creator part - well, not exactly, no.

Yes it indeed formed the universe.<br>  <br>  The universe as we know it had a beginning.  That does not mean that nothing existed at that time, nor does it mean there was any "before" that time (see the point about time itself having a beginning).|`|WHJDbvmEaa	Yes, energy and matter are the things the universe is made of.

And matter could not be created or destroyed, it could only change form.  There was only so much energy in the universe, only so much matter in the universe, and there could never be any more or any less of either.<br>  <br>  But Einstein took us one step further.  Energy could be converted to matter and vice versa. Energy and matter, he said, were both made of the same thing.  And there is only so much of -that-, whatever it is.<br>  <br>  In a nuclear reaction, some matter is converted to energy.  When a uranium atom splits into two lead atoms, some energy is released. The two lead atoms weigh less than the original uranium atom, because some of its mass has been converted to energy.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Energy can be converted to matter, kid.  E = mc^2

The tithe went in part to help feed the poor.  If God can respect socialism, why can't conservatives?<br>  <br>  Conservatives are afraid that their hard-earned money will go to support lazy, unworthy, or low-class people who haven't "earned" it.  They teach right-leaning Christians that socialism is evil.

One night, a few years later, I felt my legs vibrate. I had been drinking and I remembered what Mark had said about the devil. I am not sure what I was thinking, but somehow I remembered that story about the devil and it struck me as odd that was happening to my legs and then it felt like the bed was vibrating.

7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	I dont recall anywhere in the scriptures where anyone was condemned to hell for not being in a church, the reason we are condemned to hell is by not having Jesus Christ as our Savior... period.<br>  As for your first question, yes edification and lifting up of fellow believers in a church fellowship setting is very rewarding. However check your motives for attending a church. Be sure you attend for the proper reason, which is to honor and glorify God, to learn of his word and to grow in fellowship with your brothers and sisters in Christ. Do not try to use the church as a social aid or you will be sorely disappointed.<br>  The #1 piece of advice i can offer you as for your relationship with Christ, one thing I noticed you did not mention, spend time in his word, read your bible daily. Keep a strong prayer life, spend time with the Lord in prayer. This does not mean you have to be on your knees with eyes closed all afternoon, but you can be in a prayerful state of mind while you are moving around doing your daily activities. I often talk with the Lord when I am driving or cutting grass or any other activities that I do alone around my home.<br>  I will certainly be keeping you in prayer here.<br>  <br>  God bless :)|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	I mean, I'm not God, but I don't think God's going to discriminate because you don't attend church. However maybe the feeling you're getting that he wants more from you is Him wanting you to join a church. Finding one where you feel comfortable can help you get rid of that spiritual wall and have more of your questions answered.|`|iou7nV3Kaa	Finding a "good" church is hard. There's only a few churches out there that teach the right thing. Reading the bible and meditating on those scriptures will bring you closer to God.

I would say though you may feel like there's a little bit of a separation between you and God, the reality is that God is always with you for the Holy Spirit abides with you forever.

Both are good places to learn but not everything in it is factual. For instance I am Roman Catholic by birth and upbringing but I do not believe the Pope is the voice of God. I know that for centuries the Pope was a political figure who often was more corrupt than we would like to know. Does this mean the current Pope is not an honorable man of God? No! It simply means that the present incarnation of a church does not always reflect its image at conception. So instead I have made efforts to look at as many sources for enlightenment as I can and in doing so I have found many common threads that have helped me weave a more complete tapestry of how I am to interact with God.<br>  <br>  I subscribe to many beliefs that precede Christ but at the same time my faith allows me to accept Christ. I am able to embrace the Holy Trinity, it makes sense to me. The one thing that you need to grasp is that God is a journey and so long as you are traveling with an open heart you are heading in the right direction. Remember the old saying the destination is not as important as the journey.|`|sGojEWOxaa	I think that going to church will certainly help you, it is one of the main ways that we feed our spiritual man.<br>  Also, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?<br>  Acts 19:2-4 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   2He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. <br>  <br>   3And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. <br>  <br>   4Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you that you will go to heaven if you don't do this or that.  ONLY God's word will judge, people have nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  What does His Word say about going to church?<br>  Hebrews 10:25<br>  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>  <br>  Psalm 27:4<br>  One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.<br>  <br>  Psalm 23:6<br>  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.<br>  <br>  Find a good Apostolic Church and you will grow, I promise you that!<br>  <br>  You need to seperate yourself from the world and the things of the world.<br>  2 Corinthians 6:17<br>  Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.<br>  1 Peter 2:9<br>  But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;<br>  1 John 2:15<br>  Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

Salvation is based on God's grace in our lives, not on what we do.  If you believe He died and rose again for your sins and you've confessed them, then you will be in His presence for eternity.<br>  <br>  Yes, you should definitely get involved in a Bible believing church.  I also think that you should find a woman to disciple you.  This is someone who can talk w/you, pray w/you and help you study the Bible more effectively.  I'm sure there is a woman at the church who would be more than willing to do this.<br>  <br>  God bless and feel free to email me anytime if you have any questions.|`|7a8myOpKaa	maybe you should find a church you fit into and feel comfotable in.<br>  start praying more and more.<br>  talk to God.<br>  praise him, let him kno you love him.<br>  ask for forgiveness and give thanks.<br>  its not the religion your in but the relation you have with God.(:<br>  and im not sure about your second question, sorry :/|`|LMlZPygwaa	Get off of Y!

And no one can really tell you where you are going because only God knows your heart and whether you are saved or not.  And what really helps is have daily prayer with Him.  Maybe at least like 10 or 15 minutes a day but you should try to increase it as you go.  It might be hard at first to just talk to Him for even a few minutes because you feel like you have run out of things to say, but after a while it feels like you could just talk to Him for hours.  But going to a church will help you a lot too.  But make sure you go to a Holy Spirit filled church, not just a church that wants to make you feel good.  Pray to God about it and ask Him to put you in a church where you can get the closest to Him.  Churches can help you grow in God.  Also try to stay away from things that God might not want you to do.  Also another thing that can really help you get closer to Him, is to truly worship Him, you could worship Him just in your lifestyle as well.  Also reading the Bible helps.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Find a simple Bible church in your area.  :)  Baptist is fine as well. <br>  <br>  Going to a church building isn't what saves.  It is BELIEVING in Jesus alone for salvation, that saves you  :)   Believe, and you will never be sent to hell, no matter what!<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|oFiStmkGaa	Heck, I don't go to church, yet my relationship with Yahweh (God's personal Name) is more secure than it ever was. Going to church is certainly beneficial, but it depends where you go because some places leave a person unsatisfied and more spiritually down. In Matthew 25 we need to have the oil (symbolic of the Spirit in our lives) in order to partake in the Rapture, it's not about going to church or not, consider people in places where there aren't any churches (like in the Middle East), do you think Yahweh will punish them?<br>  <br>  I'm gonna recommend free material (check out the sources section below) for you to browse through, it's what made me really fall in love with Yahweh (God) on a deep level, I have become convinced He exists, proven by science, prophecy, archaeology, history and spirituality. You need to rekindle your relationship, and you need new revelation of Him.<br>  <br>  BTW: The majority of mankind will cease to exist upon death, neither being born from above nor born from below they'll simply perish (John 3:16) when the die, they'll have their souls dissipated. Hell, eternal emotional suffering (not physical flames), is only for those who actively lead people away from Yahweh, like religious leaders, politicians, humanist leaders, etc.<br>  <br>  BTW: the Rapture happens on the Feast of Trumpets on the 1st day of the 7th month on the Biblical calendar; however, we don't know which year, hence it being a surprise.|`|AA11232725	Going to church doesn't determine your eternal destiny however when a person becomes a Christian they are called to be a connected part of the body of Christ.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:11  And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,  12  for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,  13  till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;  14  that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,  15  but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head--Christ  16  from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the Spirit has already identified for you what you need to do. Consider these passages if you will.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:23  Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.  24  And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,  25  not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 12:5  There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.  6  And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all.  7  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: <br>  <br>   8  for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit,  9  to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,  10  to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.  11  But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.  <br>  <br>  12  For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.  13  For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free--and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.  14  For in fact the body is not one member but many.  <br>  <br>  15  If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?  16  And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?  17  If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?  18  But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased.  19  And if they were all one member, where would the body be?  20  But now indeed there are many members, yet one body.  21  And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."  <br>  <br>  22  No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.  23  And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty,  24  but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it,  25  that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.  26  And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.  27  Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Jam 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.

It is your relationship with Jesus Christ that saves you.  "It is by grace we have been saved, and this not of ourselves.  It is the gift of God.  Not by works, so that no one can boast."  You are saved not because of anything good you did to earn your salvation, but because of what Jesus did on your behalf--because He came to earth, lived the perfect life, and then died on your behalf.  Because He loves you that much.<br>  <br>  It is very, very difficult to grow in relationship with God when we are not in fellowship with one another.  Hebrews 10:25 says "Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another —and all the more as you see the Day approaching."<br>  <br>  If you are having a hard time finding a good church, try listening to their sermons and finding our about their ministries on-line ahead of time.

You could do a paper on the struggle of gay youth - for one thing, young people are not suppose to be sexual, so its already hard enough to mature in a healthy way, but GLBTQ kids have it even harder because a lot of adults see homosexuality as something deviant and sick, even if they pretend they dont (my family say they are all in support of me, yet they havent even mentioned it to any of the other relatives, or my sisters wont tell their kids they have a gay brother - **** that).

I bet you haven't even read the book of Mormon.<br>  Deciding if a religion is true or false requires more than just talking to friends and family.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	An angel appeared to a boy with a book written on plates which holds words of God.  <br>  <br>  The book is real and tangible, you can hold it and read it and determine for yourself if it's true.  Millions have, and nobody is worse off in life for having knowledge.<br>  <br>  If you haven't looked into it from their point of view you don't know anything about it and therefore can't make a poor decision on it's veracity.<br>  <br>  Open the door, read the book, and give it an hour of your life.  If you find what I found every other hour for the rest of your life will be enriched and blessed.  If not, you learned something in the same amount of time it takes to watch a prime time tv show.<br>  <br>  Either way, give it a chance!|`|fFq68dJYaa	Tell them you will convert as soon as they convert into your First And True Church of Satanism.

I think you should keep your meeting and listen to the Missionaries some more and address your concerns to them. If you still can't get your answers resolved than tell them you're not interested anymore.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: The Book of Mormon wasn't written after the Bible it was written congruently. God's word will be similar because God's voice is the same to all.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	Why are you afraid?  There is no need for you to be afraid.  If you decide that you do not want to know about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ and the true gospel, there is no obligation for you to do so.  As for your statement about knowing that "mormonism is false" - I must disagree with you.  Your fears and doubts do NOT come from God.<br>  <br>  Please do yourself a favor that will have eternal consequences.  Learn about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and make it a part of your life.  You will be eternally grateful that you made the right choice.  I have put it to the test.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	The missionaries probably already suspect that you are no longer interested. They will not get angry they will not get upset. They might get a little disappointed but that will be about it. Do not be afraid to tell them that you are not interested any more. I served as a missionary and and I know that they will keep trying to come back as long as you keep telling them it is ok to. <br>  <br>  As far as proof that the Book of Mormon is true, look no further than your knees. It is God that we are trying to follow, so it is His opinion that matters. <br>  I am glad to hear that you believe in Christ, I believe that you are telling the truth. We do not want to take that belief away from you, we only want to help get it stronger. <br>  Someone once said that if you go to one religion to find out about another then the answer you get is frequently a violation of the commandment Thou shalt not bear false witness. <br>  We are promised, in the book of James that if we lack wisdom and we take our question to God with faith, then He will help us find the answer. (James 1:5)|`|g7XmorbCaa	I think it is more of the commitment you are afraid of. What is wrong with listening to them -Being open minded is a good thing. No -you can't possibly know the LDS church is false -Especially since you haven't heard what they have to say.-??.  At least listen -or you will go through your whole life wondering -and thinking you know -When you don't. Good-Luck!!

A friend of mine was in a similar situation and they started to show up to her house on Sunday mornings to ask if she wanted to go to church with them.  <br>  <br>  Say NO they'll get over it.

Tell them they are bothering you.|`|fI263M9eaa	You don't KNOW anything of the sort, only what others have told you.  As a child, you have to rely on the honesty and good intentions of those who protect you.  But being human, they too can make mistakes.<br>  <br>  When you grow up, you learn to put away your childish habits, and begin to learn and make decisions for yourself.  If you have the same skepticism about the beliefs you were raised with, as you do about those which are alien to you, then you are on the road to discovering a greater truth, and growing up at the same time.<br>  <br>  (This is not an endorsement of Mormonism, or even traditional Christianity.  It is only a recommendation to do your own research and thinking.)|`|c6mG9bIiaa	Tell them that you are not interested and hang up. Threaten to call police if they keep harassing you.

Believing in God or accepting that there is a God does absolutely nothing for you.  It won't change you.  It won't help you.  It won't make you different or save your marriage.  In James 2 we are told that even the demons believe in God.  James goes even further though, in that the demons actually shudder.  Do you shudder at the mention of God.  Are you filled with a picture of holiness and perfect justice?  If you are, that's a good start.  If you aren't, then you still don't know him, so you still haven't accepted him.<br>  <br>  Man needs to understand that for their to be a change God has to do a work in you, you don't do any work for God.  Your decision?  Foolishness.  We all know people who made a decision and their life is every bit as hellish now as it was before their decision.  If that is what salvation is, why in the world would you want to sign up for it?  Do you truly want to be different?  Repent.  Repent of your sin and cry out to Jesus for salvation.  The bible says that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.  It's in Romans, Acts, and the prophet Joel.  You won't be different until God saves you.<br>  <br>  Remember, on that day many will say, "Lord, Lord!", but Jesus will say, "I don't know you.  Depart from me you worker of lawlessness."  These people knew who God was.  They knew who Jesus was.  They read about him and they even prayed to him.  They didn't act like him, though.  They didn't do the work of our Father in heaven.  They treated Jesus like an accessory.  I've got the life I want, now all I need is Jesus to make it complete.  No, friend.  If you aren't different than before, if you don't see a change in your life then God didn't save you.  You are still in your sin and you are still bound for hell.  As a favorite preacher of mine once said, one grace gets a hold of you, you will get grace.  You'll get it and it will be uncontrollable.  You can't help but worship and you can't help but tell people abou tit.<br>  <br>  If God accepts you, you'll be very different than before.  Don't stop crying out to him for salvation until you get it or you die.|`|d4L1vqxEaa	You are "bestowed" with the Holy Spirit in your heart.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Great question....here's the answer...<br>  <br>  "But as many as received him (Jesus), TO THEM he gave the power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his name, which were born.... not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God"- (John 1:12)<br>  <br>  "If any man is in Christ he is a NEW creation; old things are passed away , all things are become new".<br>  <br>  You will be so new it is called being "born again" by Christ.....and you will HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Life.

I can be with others, but my relationship with Jesus is so sweet.  He knows me so well and loves me just the way I am.  I can tell you that Jesus wants to change you only in as much as you will be a happier person.  He will not make you into a cookie cutter image of anyone; you are one of a kind; you are unique.  If you seek Him and find Him, you will find acceptance and a love deeper, more profound and trusting than anything you have ever experienced.

If the church is a friendly open church you will be approached by others and they won't care if you aren't the 'belle of the ball'.

Churches are very welcoming.|`|5CoJZut4aa	Of course! God uses all kinds of people! Consider the nuns and monks*( Yes there are protestant ones) who sit in silence and reflection and pray. God would not think that there is anything wrong with you. He created you to be that way! You may also want to consider moving to be more contemplative church! Where silence and reflction are practiced. But remeber also that God didn't make us to be alone. There is great risks in being an introvert!

I promise you that there are many people who would enjoy your company.  I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “The problem isn’t the bait you are using it is the pond you are fishing in!”  As many people here have mentioned it may be time to broaden your social circles.  <br>  <br>  You can also try emailing some of the folks here on Y!A.  I’ve met some very delightful people here and I am constantly amazed at how smart, funny, and entertaining this bunch can be!<br>  <br>  I’m not sure there is a term to describe my belief system since it contains components of several different religions.  I guess the closest thing is atheist.  It might surprise you to know that my husband is a devout Christian and we love each other very much.  My point is that you don’t have to agree on everything for someone to be your friend.  In fact, having different views is part of what makes things so interesting.|`|ZpXFulyCaa	Of course there are loners in the church and God loves His introverts as well as His outroverts---I mean His extroverts.  :-)<br>  <br>  But there's still the matter of the Great Commission that Jesus gives in Matthew 28:16-20 (Go into all the world...teach...gospel...)  Everyone won't be a preacher or a teacher.  If you know Jesus, you'd need to find a way that doesn't freak you out to share Him with others.  There are quiet ways (like via written correspondence or online or by writing poetry.)  There are one-on-one ways---just being a Christ-like example with someone you know.<br>  <br>  It's sad that you're in that situation---surrounded by and ignored by cliques, I mean.  Church cliques are not God's idea of Christianity and people need to be sure they're looking out for loners to help them feel more comfortable.|`|uUTmx9ZPaa	No one should be a loner. Being in christ is not like the worlds religions. We are all members of the one universal Body of Christ. No matter how spiritual you are individually, you can never be complete without the Body. The tabernacle is the old testament was made of wooden boards (signifying the individual members of the body). Each board was 1.5 units wide. The number 3 signifies the triune God. No matter how spiritual you are you will always only have a fraction of God ~ 1.5. You need to be joined to the another member to be 3 units, signifying God's complete nature.<br>  <br>  Probably the place where you meet is still not yet composed of genuine Christians. Consider praying to the Lord. Tell the Lord you want to be in the reality of the Body of Christ. Let me tell you, after you pray this, you will find the genuine expression of the body of Christ in your locality.

That's not a viewpoint.  It's a fact.<br>  <br>  Edit: You start with a hypothesis and then look for evidence.  The type of evidence we need to look for is empirical evidence.  Other kinds of evidence, such as anecdotal, are not valid for establishing a viable scientific theory.  It might help lead us to empirical evidence, and if so, that's fine.  It doesn't matter what led us there as long as it's verified.<br>  <br>  I am not aware of any valid scientific theories about God.

And there's no good argument against it... so that just proves the point further|`|f0JLp4hFaa	Not necessarily.  We're allowed our beliefs.  <br>  <br>  My reasons aren't "superior", they're just my reasons for believing there is most likely no supernatural anything:<br>  <br>  <br>  1) Supernatural explanations are ALWAYS replaced by natural explanations:<br>  All of these things were once attributed to god(s) or spirits:  floods, hurricanes, the existence and movement of the Sun, Moon and stars, the tides, earthquakes, disease and health, success or failure of crops, rain or drought, tidal waves, eclipses, why children look like their parents, the diversity of life.  ALL of them have since been explained as our understanding of the natural world has improved.<br>  <br>  Number of natural explanations replaced by supernatural explanations:  zero.<br>  <br>  2) Inconsistency of world religions:  <br>  If God is so important and ever-present in our lives, why can't anybody agree on anything about God?  If God is not important or ever-present, why does God matter?<br>  <br>  3) Arguments for God are always weak:<br>  The arguments presented by religious people fall into the same categories:  argument from authority (God exists because the Bible says so), argument from personal experience (I just KNOW God exists), and special pleading (God is above being questioned).  None of these are based on logic or evidence.<br>  <br>  4) God keeps shrinking:<br>  In the Old Testament, God parted seas and made worlds.  Now God seems to only give comfort to a few individuals, magically craft the occasional bacterial flagellum, and put his image on toast or tree bark.<br>  <br>  5) Religion comes from parents:<br>  Children may learn more about subjects than their parents, may have differing views about so many things (politics, social issues, etc.).  But religion is almost always chosen, not by the individual, but by the individual's parents. <br>  <br>  6) All components of the "soul" are affected by physical things:<br>  Consciousness, identity, personality, character, emotions - these can all be affected by drugs, brain injuries, etc.  So all appear to be based on physical mechanisms.  No supernatural component is required.  No supernatural soul means no afterlife.<br>  <br>  7) Nothing supernatural has EVER withstood testing:<br>  When someone claiming paranormal powers or a paranormal event agrees to have it tested, they ALWAYS fail and almost always claim the test was unfair.  If gods are supernatural, and if no claim of supernatural has EVER survived testing, why should I believe in gods?<br>  <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/online.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csicop.org/si/online.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-c...</a><br>  <br>  8) Most claims of an all-powerful god are untestable or unfalsifiable<br>  Reality can be tested.  A reality-based idea can be proved true or false.  But a divine being with no physical form whose actions are indistinguisable from random natural phenomena cannot be tested or falsified.  Knowledge or worship of God provides no useful predictions.  A small coastal town full of simple, religious villagers is just as likely to get wiped off the map by a tsunami as a big city full of atheists.  And if the divine being's actions are indistinguishable from random nature, why bother to worship him/her/it/them?<br>  <br>  9) Our understanding of God never improves:<br>  2000 years ago we had a bunch of different religious factions, all bickering or warring over their different interpretations of their gods.  That is exactly what we have today.  Our understanding of God never improves because there's nothing to understand.  But over the same time period, our understanding of the natural world has grown:<br>  - from huddling around a wood fire to harnessing the power of the atom;<br>  - from witch doctors to eradicating smallpox and polio;<br>  - from astrology to the Hubble Telescope;<br>  - from mud huts to skyscrapers;<br>  - from camels to Airbus;<br>  - etc...<br>  <br>  10) Complete lack of evidence<br>  If a powerful god wishes our worship, he/she/it need only part a sea, write in the sky or do SOMETHING sufficiently grand and inexplicable, and all religions would unite, all bickering would cease, and all atheists would pray.  If a giant voice boomed across the Earth and said "You must protect the planet, must never have more than 2 children, must help a person in need every day, and must stop burning coal and oil within 5 years or I will smite you all", the entire planet would unite in common purpose.<br>  <br>  So, that's why I don't believe in God, and why I think the only way to avoid destroying ourselves is to stop wasting thought and energy on the supernatural, put down our Bibles/Vedas/Korans, and learn about the REAL world.|`|oFiStmkGaa	Yes, and atheists (Humanists) are some of the most arrogant people you'll ever meet, especially when you say you're a believer in God, they obviously think themselves superior to any other beliefs, it's only natural.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Some Christians also see themselves as superior to any people of other beliefs, and also appear "arrogant".|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Yes, is superior of people blindly believe illogical "kuso" have no proof, most intelligent humans use logic and science that show gods are imaginary, you claim superior viewpoint use imaginary god, why your god not know pi is 3.14159, sky not solid dome 7 miles above us, have many contradictions in holy book?

X3Lp0ewMaa	It was the Chicken Pox we had as kids that comes back as adults and attacks the nervous system causing Shingles. I had them on my face 2 years ago and in my scalp it was awful. I kooked like someone had beat me up one eye swelled shut. But they didn't give me a shot this must be very new. The only thing the doc said is that I could get them again... I hope I never have that again It's very painful...|`|y7HD8unTaa	Cut back on certain foods to avoid shingles before taking any shots...that's my advice.  Yes, shingles is painful.  Yeast, organ meats, fish, high fat foods, swiss cheese are just a few of the "offending" food on the list that I have had to cut out or cut back on.  <br>  <br>  Yeast is one of the hardest to avoid. <br>  Fish oil is another.  glucosimine condroiden (sp)joint compound has far too much fish oil & causes shingles outbreaks in many people who take it for joint pain.  <br>  <br>  Remember if it's stored in the liver of other animals & we humans take it...it's also stored in our livers & that's a big part of the problem that these medical & herbal companies are conflicting on.  No one wants to talk.

In fact, my mom, who is in her late 80's, got one about two years ago.  A lot of insurance companies do not pay for it and it is not inexpensive -- I think it is about $100 or so (it may have even been more than that).  My mom was lucky in that her insurance paid for most of it.<br>  <br>  I had a very mild form of shingles about 2 years ago -- only had 4 breakout spots on my left arm -- it was very painful.  I thought I had been bit by a spider.  My doctor told me I was lucky, that I had a very mild form.  That is when we decided that my mom should get the shot.  I haven't gotten one because the doctor said you are actually immune from shingles for about 4 years after you have had it.|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	I've heard of it, it's been out for a few years.  It was chicken pox.<br>  Shingles is not debilitating if you catch it fast enough and get on the medicine, but it takes a few months to fully recover from it.

Ask your doctor about this. Do not wait until you must wish that you had.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Medicare now pays for the shingles shot for seniors who had chicken pox earlier in their lives.  I had mine last month. I had no side effects aside from a little redness at the site of the shot. It is very expensive to treat shingles aside from the pain and suffering.  Medicare prefers that you have the shot rather than go through all that and it ends up paying way more if you get the disease.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	A couple years ago, my doctor told me about this shot.  It cost about $100 (if I remember right).  He had to call the pharmacy and tell them you were coming to get the serum, and give you the prescription.  Then, you had to go quickly to the pharmacy and back.  Short time limit between getting the serum from them, and getting same back to the doctor, so you could be injected.<br>  <br>  Now, that was a couple years ago.  They may have improved it since then.  I hope.<br>  <br>  I have had mild cases of shingles about twice.  First time, I thought I had a spider bite on my left side of my tummy.  Second time,  I had a spot on my arm, one somewhere on my torso, and a 3rd spot on my upper arm.  When I told my doctor, he knew where the 3rd spot would be before I even told him.  <br>  <br>  It hurt.  It lasted weeks and weeks.  And it was preceded by nausea and vomiting before the spots broke out.  Even at that, I was lucky.  It can get really, really bad.  Involving the eye and everything.  So, I think that even if the shingles vaccine is expensive and you have to do that quick trip to the pharmacy, it is still worth it.  Worth every penny and every bit of bother.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	My husband had a horrible case of shingles last winter (2007-08) and when he asked the doctor about the shot he said it was up to him and that it isn't all that effective if you have had shingles already.  So, he did not get it;|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Yes there is a shot for shingles. I got one about 5 years ago. I woke up one morning with the worst headache I have ever had and the left side of my head was very red and swollen. I had a temperature. I called the doctor right away and they told me to come right in. The doctor took one look at me and told me I had cranial shingles which effect the head to the shoulder. He explained to me that there are three sets of nerve systems on one side of your body and three on the other. The nerve systems are head to shoulder, shoulder to waist and waist to feet. You can get shingles 6 different times but never in the same area twice. Anyway, he told me that I was the first person to get to him before I broke out in a rash and he gave me a shot and I never did break out in a rash. He also gave me some pills to take but within 24 hours it was all gone. He still tells me today that I am the only person that ever got to him before they broke out. Once you break out, the shot will not help you. I do think that there is a vaccine out now though but I am not sure. Ask your doctor about it. That was the worst pain I ever felt and I have had natural child birth. The only way you can get shingles which is a herpes virus is from a chlld who is contagious with the chicken pox. There is no other way to get it. It might be a child that sat in the grocery cart you used or something else the child touched but diet has nothing to do with it. Anything that causes a rash comes from the herpes virus that includes measles, scarlet fever, hives and so on. Again diet has nothing to do with it. You have to be infected by the virus.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I knew it was in the works, but was not sure if the doctors had begun to administer them. It would be a good idea to check with your GP.

So since you believe Jesus is God, can you answer the following:<br>  <br>  Why did God not show himself to Moses fully if Jesus is God? I thought no one could see God and live, yet Jesus is God???<br>  <br>  Why does Jesus pray to God if he is God? I don't pray to myself. Jesus said the father is greater. I am certainly not greater than myself.<br>  <br>  Why would Jesus & God BOTH be in heaven, if Jesus is simply a manifestation of God?<br>  <br>  Or do you believe that they are all equal, and together they make up one god?? That reminds me of that cartoon Captain Planet where they have those rings, and then one superhero forms from their combined rings. Is this how you view Jesus, God, and God's spirit? They combine to form one mighty God?<br>  <br>  Why does Jesus never clearly tell us that he is God? He clearly tells us he is the messiah, son of God, and son of man. He spoke these words very clearly. Yet he never says he is god, or that you have to believe he is God.<br>  <br>  Why was Jesus happy when he asked Simon Peter who he thought he was, and Peter replied that he thinks he is the son of god, and the messiah. It made Jesus happy. If he was God, he should have rebuked Peter and told him to take of his sandals (just like God told Moses).<br>  <br>  I could go on and on. It simply isn't biblical the concept Jesus is God, or the trinity. It was a teaching the church developed in about 300 AD (after Jesus & the disciples were long gone), and they were divided on the issue and basically had a vote to decide it.<br>  <br>  Does that show you anything???|`|DArAz67Caa	it's very doubtful-----JW is a cult----|`|hj76FSKdaa	They believe that Jehovah God existed from the beginning. His first creations were two angels, Michael (who later becomes Jesus) and Lucifer (who later became Satan).  <br>  <br>  But to have a relationship with Jesus, you have to accept him as he claimed to be.<br>  <br>  A good question to ask a Jehovah Witness is this: If the evidence of a saving faith is our good works, how many good works are enough so that we know we will be forgiven and accepted by God?<br>  <br>  They will usually answer something like this: Jehovah sees our heart and if we are doing the best we can, He sees this and He will accept us.<br>  <br>  You should respond by saying: But how you know that you are doing your best? If you think about it and are truly honest, can't you think of more things you could be doing to please Jehovah than what you are doing now? <br>  <br>  Christians are supposed to have an assurance of salvation (I John 5:13).   And you get that assurance through Jesus, not through faithful membership in a particular religion.   Jesus himself thought that it was important who people thought he was (Matthew 16:13-15).

MjPCRFbOaa	Strictly speaking they didn't always say his presence began then, the first said the kingdom of God would come then and they would ascend in a type of rapture, but it didn't happen so they revised the doctrine to say it meant Christ actually took his throne in heaven then and all saints who had died then ascended to heaven, and will come to earth within the generation who sees the events of 1914. <br>  The Biblical numerology they use to calculate that date is a bit baffling because they lift numbers from 5 or 6 passages throughout the old testament prophets to the letters of Paul and John's Revelation.<br>  This is the best I can say from memory.<br>  Incidentally the followers took this prediction very seriously.  J.F.Rutherford built an enormous, oppulent Xanadu-like estate for the resurrected heroes of the Bible to live when they returned.

But they have never contemplated it from this angle.<br>  6 When, now, they had assembled, they went asking him: "Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?" 7 He said to them: "It does not belong to YOU to get knowledge of the times or seasons which the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction; 8 but YOU will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon YOU, and YOU will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Ju?de′a and Sa?mar′i?a and to the most distant part of the earth."<br>  Noticed how Jesus responded to the question:  He said:  It does not belong to YOU to get knowledge of the times or seasons... Jesus wanted that his followers would continue to witness about him to the most distant part of the earth.<br>  Why then have the leaders of the Watchtower-society tried to figure out times and seasons which the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction? Is that not disobedience?<br>  Here are some points out of their Revelation Climax-book, something indicating that the Kingdom is not yet established. Page 220§22:<br>  The final three trumpet blasts were different, for they were called woes. (Revelation 8:13; 9:12) The first two of these consisted particularly of the locusts and the armies of cavalry, while the third introduced the birth of Jehovah's Kingdom.<br>  The first woe is the locusts.  Which symbolize according to the Watchtower-teaching the anointed preaching from 1914 until the so called other sheep appeared. <br>  The second woe; is the armies of cavalry. According to the Watchtower-teaching represents today's preaching of Jehovah's witnesses.<br>  The third woe, which follows the first two, is the introduced of the birth of God's Kingdom as stated in § 22 and it's also written in the Bible. Revelation 11:14, 15:<br>  14 The second woe is past. Look! The third woe is coming quickly. 15 And the seventh angel blew his trumpet. And loud voices occurred in heaven, saying: "The kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever." <br>  So, we live in the time of second woe, while the preaching is going on around the earth. That means that the third woe has yet not begun with the birth of God's Kingdom. So no God's Kingdom in 1914 in heaven invisibly. <br>  Then after this Revelation 12 tells about a war in heaven and that Satan is hurled down to earth for a short period of time. That means that Satan too is not yet hurled down to earth. <br>  This also means that Jesus has not yet approved a faithful and discreet slave according to Matthew 24:45.<br>  Actually the context, verse 43,44 once again says that the slaves of Christ do not know when He returns.

Do you see it as an event that spells doom, desolation, and punishment for mankind? Or do you expect it to bring an end to all our problems? Is Christ’s coming something to be feared? Or should we look forward to it?<br>  <br>  Concerning Christ’s coming, the Bible states: “Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, . . . and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him.” (Revelation 1:7) This coming refers to Jesus’ appearing in the future to reward the just and punish the wicked.<br>  <br>  Rather than fearing it, the apostle John looked forward to Christ’s coming. After receiving the revelation about this coming and about what it will mean for the earth, John earnestly prayed: “Come, Lord Jesus.” (Revelation 22:20) But why do “all the tribes of the earth . . . beat themselves in grief because of him”? In what way will “every eye” see him? What will Christ’s coming accomplish? How can putting faith in it benefit us now? The following article will answer these questions.|`|mCpWSayeaa	They don't know. They are probably making it up or have a weird answer why. <br>  I say just believe in Jesus and God.

AA11047076	A correction to some of the answers given:  the calendar we used today is based on calculations that were fixed by Hillel around 30 BCE- however, until 400 CE the times were still varied a bit from this as they were fixed by observation and the proclamation of the Sanhedrin.  It was only when the exile was too widely dispersed for the Sanhedrins proclamations to be readily disseminated that calculation alone became the basis for the calendar.<br>  <br>  However, since the proclamation of the month was by visual sighting of the new Moon- it would invariably at worst be only a day ot ar most two days after the calculated day thus the calculation programs used which rely on lunar cycles still give  a good reflection based on what would have been the reality.  As such- the 14 Nissan in 3791 would most likely have been on the Monday night- but with a possibiltiy of Tuesday night and a very low probability of Wednesday night<br>  <br>  If it had been a leap year and an extra month of 29 days inserted than it would have been on the Tuesday night, with a possibility of it being on the Wednesday night and a very low probablity of it being on a Thursday night.<br>  <br>  Note to Dave C:  The festival of Pesach was celebrated for the first time the night they were delivered form Egypt, not before that.  Nothing in Psalm 81 contradicts that- especially as Psalm 81 is referring to ROSH HASHANAH, not Pesach!  (You know the festival when the shofar is blown on the first of the month...)  As for Jesus- sorry, nothing in the Tanakh refers to him- the Tanakh insists on monotheism, it does nto have place in it for Pagan concepts of gods going around impregnating unsuspecting girls.  Yes, I know Zeus and Jupiter were notable philanderers, but Jews don;t worship anything with a satyriasis problem!<br>  <br>  edit to BMCR:  You ar emistaken over the timing:  The lamd was sacrificed in the afternoon- and then eaten that night- the afternoon would have been the 13 Nissan, the night 14 Nissan.  The Korban Pesach had to be eaten after nightfall- but no sacrifices were done at night- therefore the actual sacrifice was done in the daylight, the eating at night.  Theres actually a great description of this in the talmud- it talks about how the people would line up in rows in front of the slaughtering rings int he temple while the Levi'im sang specific Psalms.  as one finished, the next would take their place as the previous people took their lamb to roast.  People were so eager that it is said that even though thousands of sacrifices had to be made in that afternoon the Levi'im never got to finish the third repetition of their psalms.|`|2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	????????As you've already discovered, you cannot get definitive information on that subject.  The devil seeks to obscure such things.  You must take the Bible at its word.  Also, you are correct in your understanding that the Passover is on the 14th day of the first month of God's annual calendar.  Starting with Exodus 12, you will see that God specified the 14th day as Passover.  Then, that evening, the Passover meal was eaten -- but that is not the beginning of Passover, that is the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  Modern Jews often call the entire period "the Passover" but it is not.  You will notice in Leviticus 23 that God specified the 15th day as the first holy convocation of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  The 15th day starts at evening on what we would call the 14th day.<br>  <br>  ????????To answer your question, though, the Bible specifies the Passover, on which Jesus was crucified, was on a Friday (the preparation).  It also specifies He rested on the day of the weekly Sabbath, and it specifies He rose on the first day of the week.  The Bible further specifies that Jesus would resurrect from the grave on the third day.  Sunday was the third day.  By faith, hold fast to that pillar of your faith and don't let the deceptions of the devil sway you from it.<br>  <br>  ????????To continue, though, we had a presentation at our Feast of Tabernacles, last fall, from an astronomer.  He used the Bible descriptions from God as to how to determine the beginning of God's annual calendar, plus mathematical calculations and observations from astronomy, and one seemingly unrelated statement from Ellen G. White, to demonstrate that Passover was, indeed, on a Friday in the year 31AD -- rather than the Monday suggested by Jewish calendars and the Wednesday suggested by using other means of determining the beginning of God's annual calendar.<br>  <br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  EDIT: BMCR:<br>  ????????You're making too many assumptions, but I'll address only a few...  The Feasts were celebrated a long, long time before there was ever a Jew and before Mt. Sinai, too (Psalms 81:1-5).  Nothing I said is strictly from a Christian perspective nor assumes Jesus was born in the year 1.  Everything I said is based on the Old Testament -- not the New.  The New Testament isn't new -- it's just true.  Also, I said "based on"...  Even the days of the week on which He was sacrificed, rested, and resurrected are based on the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  God bless.

However, we know that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit while he was still in the womb.  Hence, the body has a soul even before birth.<br>  <br>  Is it possible that all fertile embryos have a soul?  Yes, it is.  The soul is not limited by the size of the body.  Since it is possible, then we should not be creating embryos for the purpose of destroying them.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	To me, the soul is the combination of the physical and the spiritual elements. When does the soul first appear in a living thing is a better question and it is almost identical with to the question, when does a fetus become a living human?<br>  <br>  This is one of those areas that is filled with debate because it is not specified in the Bible. We know that at some point prior to birth, the unborn become conscious and react to stimulus (loud noises, for instance) outside the body of the mother. To me, that indicates that the unborn has become a living human. There is a strong indication this was well known in Biblical times (the case of Elizabeth's unborn child, who would become John the Baptist jumping in her womb when Mary, who was carrying the unborn Jesus entered the room).<br>  <br>  But when, before that, does it take place? In my opinion, it takes place when the fetus becomes viable to surviving outside the womb with or without additional help.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, but I didn't respond to your second question: I do not consider a human embryo to be a viable life.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	A human being - who is composed of body and soul - is created at the moment of conception.

Some teachings in the lds church say that a baby not born with life will be attatched to a spirit in the resurrection. Imaginations and theories arise all over the place based on these assumptions. <br>  it is possible that an embryo is more like a clone. or it can also be defined as cannibalism. <br>  but if a cloned embryo has not life, its more like transferring dna from a Petri-dish. <br>  on the one hand God took DNA from a rib which was taken from Adam. and EVE was the cloned and manipulated creation, thereof. <br>  so the technology is used by God in a different form. <br>  so there can be said not to be sin. <br>  the question is! did the created body of eve have life or did God breath another spirit into the body before she had life.<br>  one of the greatest ABUSES of this technology is the men Who pay for it, while those that cannot pay for it are denied. if there is anything Ethical about it.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	I have to figure out what you mean by an embryo before I would feel qualified to answer that question.<br>  <br>  I am very serious about this point.

vEEeq7kYaa	I’m going to give my views on the Jewish responses here since I’m Jewish.<br>  <br>  1) Do Hollywood and the entertainment industry threaten your values?<br>  Jews answered no to this in greater numbers primarily because we have ALWAYS been a minority ( we are less than 2 percent of the population ) and our values have NEVER been dependent on the majority culture surrounding us.  We’ve managed to keep Judaism intact for four thousand years despite every form of assault and assimilation effort around.  <br>  <br>  2) Society should accept homosexuality?<br>  The reason I believe Jews answered primarily that it should :<br>  The majority of Jews in the U.S. are Reform, and most of us ( I am Reform) recognize that one’s sexual identity is not a choice.  Thus, the majority of  answers here appear to be from a Reform Jewish perspective. Promiscuity, abuse, etc are choices and those are  the harmful aspect of human sexuality.  IMHO if we deny homosexuals the right to be married and have their own families, we’re essentially discouraging monogamy and fidelity to them.  Male homosexuality is condemned in the Torah, but they had no real notion of sexual identity in modern scientific terms then..it was more about keeping the roles of men and women separate and there are Jews who still hold to the same views of this as the strict view of Torah that it is a sin.  <br>  <br>  3) What factors most influence your thinking about government and public affairs?<br>  The choices were personal experience, views of friends and family, your religion, your education, what you see or read in the media or other factors.  <br>  <br>  Jews appeared here to have some of the hardest to pigeonhole since religion and views of friends and family were the least likely things to influence their choices.<br>  <br>  This contrasts with the rants of what antisemites are always railing about to us here in Yahoo Answers.  I think I’ll save this one for the hijacked Israel travel section<br>  <br>  4)Do you believe there are clear and absolute standards for what is right and wrong?<br>  In this one Jews answered higher in disagreement over that statement than most Christians and equaled the total from Buddhists and other religions.  I think this answer also tells me that this polling sample perhaps was overwhelmingly Reform or secular.  <br>  My own choice would have been that sometimes there are clear standards other times there aren’t so the two percent other since I can’t say “mostly” either way.<br>  5)When it comes to questions of right and wrong, which of the following do you look to most for guidance?<br>  This was a surprise.  Such a small percentage of Jews looked to religious guidance?  That doesn’t reflect my experience as a 50 year old Jew, and a Reform Jew at that.  Perhaps the majority answer of practical experience and common sense was chosen because that is what our religion TEACHES us to do, to use our common sense!  Jews question and challenge what we are taught with our God given sense to determine what is real and true.  So..yes, in a way this does make perfect sense the more I think about it.<br>  6)Aside from weddings and funerals, how often do you attend religious services?<br>  The Jewish answers here most definitely reflect what I know of Reform synagogues.  Most of the membership shows up only on holidays or Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and a small percentage show up every Shabbat. My own attendance averages a couple of times a month, perhaps a little more some months, and less others. <br>  7)Do you think there is a heaven where people who have led good lives are eternally rewarded?<br>  This answer is almost half yes, half no for Jews…and reflects the fact that there is no clear  defined dogma of just what the afterlife or the world to come will be.  It reflects that Judaism focuses on the fulfillment of what God wants from us in this life, with our gift of life from God, and that we focus on making our world a better place for us and for those who come after us.  Judaism is a life affirming faith, not focused to dwell on the afterlife.<br>  8) Do  you think there is a hell where people who have lived bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished?<br>  While the overwhelming majority of Jews said no, and that reflects Judaism.  It surprised me to see 22 percent say yes, since the Jewish notion of a place of punishment in the afterlife isn’t at all like the Christian concept of an eternal hell.  We believe that people are judged, but the concepts of hell are so different as to make this question as asked..one that I don't see how a Jew knowing Judaism could say yes at all.<br>  9.)Which of these statements comes closer to your own views :<br>  Only my religion leads to eternal life<br>  Many religions can lead to eternal life<br>  Other<br>  Another answer where Jews overwhelmingly agreed with Buddhist and Hindu and contrasted with Christians. Of course this is an answer that directly reflects the teaching of the Jewish Bible ( Tanakh) that has always taught that God is not exclusive to the Jews, but commands the Jews to be exclusive to God.  The righteous of all nations merit blessing. All humans are equal before God..those are core doctrine of Judaism and known to even the most secular among us.<br>  10)Is there only one true way to interpret the teachings of your religion?<br>  This answer overwhelmingly saying NO, certainly reflects the old adage..two Jews in one room and three opinions.<br>  11)Should your church<br>  preserve traditional beliefs and practices<br>  Adjust beliefs and practices in light of new circumstances<br>  Adopt modern beliefs and practices<br>  Other<br>  The mixed reactions from Jews again, appear here to reflect to me that among the Jewish respondents here were a significant number who were non-religious period. <br>  My answer would have been other since I think that all the history and beliefs need to be preserved, but some traditional practices should be adjusted in light of new circumstances and that modern practices to honor ancient beliefs ( such as Miriams cup) can be useful. That really isn’t an option available in any of the first three choices.<br>  12) Outside of attending religious services, how often do you pray?<br>  This answer confirms what I suspected..that among the Jewish respondents here..was a significant number of Jews who are non-religious and secular.<br>  Prayer is a daily part of Jewish life for anyone who follows Judaism.  I can't imagine a Jew that doesn't at least say the Shema or one of the many daily blessings and considers themselves following Judaism..no matter the branch.<br>  And the last q that has almost equal answers of all choices also reflects that<br>  The responses from the other groups weren’t all that surprising to me <br>  Jews comprise less than 2 percent of the U.S.population and religious Jews are less..so if this was from only 35000 people of all religions I wonder how many of each religion were asked and  I’m really wondering how good an example this is of the views of Jews who practice Judaism.<br>  This was really a small sample of the populace|`|39de4d27076c334630a8108a6bb9b519aa	Wow, that makes Jehovah's witnesses look like fanatics.|`|urQQ6kbcaa	The Mormons look popular

FOzN3xwzaa	"Cavemen" never existed.  The truth is that Adam and Eve were literally the first people that the Lord created. <br>  <br>  The word "dinosaur" wasn't an English word until the 1800's. Before that, they were called dragons, leviathans, and behemoths. All those words are in the Bible. <br>  <br>  Not every animal was brought on the ark. Only two of every kind (with a few others that were more, but most just two). <br>  <br>  Kinds produce diversity. Dogs produce other kinds of dogs, but they always make dogs. <br>  <br>  As for dinosaurs, they walked alongside man according to history, even up until three hundred to four hundred years ago or so.<br>  <br>  Very many dinosaurs died in the flood along with other animals, which is where the fossils came from. <br>  <br>  The word dragon is used a few times in the Bible. <br>  <br>  Leviathan: Job 41:1-34<br>  <br>  Behemoth: Job 40:15-24<br>  <br>  VERY detailed explanations.

Simply blind faith I am afraid...sorry.|`|NznqjqtPaa	Genesis is not a literal scientific explanation of creation.  It is an allegorical poetic narrative that is designed to tell us that there is a God, and that this God is the source of all things in the universe.<br>  <br>  The Bible is not now and was never intended to be a scientific text book.  It is the story of humanities relationship with God.  It contains many myths and stories - just because something is a myth doesn't mean it doesn't convey truth.  As I mentioned the Genesis account contains the great truth that God is the beginning and source of all of creation - however the way it is depicted is a myth - not an actual account of the scientific process used.  Other myths in the Bible which convey great truths are found with Jonah and the great fish, and with Job and his suffering. <br>  <br>  Does this mean everything in the Bible is just metaphorical?  Of course not! By studying the original language and keeping in mind the time each event is written about as well as the intended audience we can deduce what was a mythical story used to teach a moral lesson and what is an actual recorded historical event.<br>  <br>  Please just remember there is no need for conflict between faith and science.|`|pfNnuD5saa	You do know that not all Christians are creationists don't you?

gQEFy4BVaa	I'm sorry, but I think you are missing the point.<br>  <br>  The Big Bang Theory is basically that the universe itself (i.e. space-time) expanded outward from a single point, being approximately 13.7 billion years old. It is corroborated by various sources, e.g. the Cosmic Microwave Background, galaxy recession velocities and implications of metric expansion.<br>  <br>  The Cosmological Argument, or First Cause Argument, is an argument for God, in that the universe had a beginning (likely citing evidence of the Big Bang) therefore there must have been a cause for the beginning. The cause is God. This argument is flawed for many reasons, one being the fact that 'God' is not a reasonable, scientific hypothesis.<br>  <br>  The Teleological Argument, or Argument from Design, is an argument for God based on perceived evidence of order, purpose, direction and/or design in nature. This is also a flawed argument in that it is based only on personal perception, not on science, logic or observation. Also because it leads to an infinite regress: if the universe requires a designer, by the same logic God also requires a designer, and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, the Big Bang Theory is a scientific model, based on the evidence we have, that states the universe itself expanded from a single point. The Cosmological and Teleological arguments for God are completely independent of the Big Bang Theory, and all science for that matter. They are not mutually exclusive and they are not dependent on each other.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	Neither of those is actually a convincing argument for the existence of a god; they are both logically fallacious and unsupported by actual evidence.<br>  <br>  Nor is either of them actually a theory.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Neither make any logical sense|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	The best explanation we have at the moment is the big bang theory because it fits most of the known facts.

However this could be the reduction is the gravitational force as the galaxies move away from each other. And of course we still don't know exactly what "dark matter" is or even if it really exists. The other arguments are clearly just nonsense invented by people who cannot help believing in the bible no matter much evidence is against or how little for it.|`|QUg9W2NGaa	Design theory.

Ever hear of Jesus?|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: why do you persist? Leave off! You've your beliefs, Jews have theirs. "Know everything"? No, just know what the Tanakh teaches and what the NT teaches and how incompatible they are. <br>  <br>  You've spread the "good word" - we believe differently.  Goodbye<br>  <br>  It is the hallmark of pagan, idolatrous faiths, to confuse God with human beings, either that God becomes human, or that humans become God. In Biblical history, one sees this confusion with Pharaoh, and with Haman (boo, hiss!), as well as with Antiochus, the Assyrian King against whom the Maccabbees rebelled. Furthermore, as one example, in Hosea 11:9 God tell us, "For I am God and not a man."<br>  <br>  . The Jewish idea of God is that God is One and Indivisible. We cannot divide God up into separate parts, where each part of God is UnEqual to each of the other parts, but somehow they are one and the same. The Hebrew Scriptures describes God as an absolute One, but the Christian's New Testament describes the Christian idea of God as divisible into three parts called a trinity. In the Christian's New Testament, Jesus at one point claims to have different knowledge than other parts of the Christian Trinity. For example, Matthew 24:36 or Mark 13:32. In another verse, Jesus does not have the same power as other parts of the Christian Trinity, for example, Luke 23:34. And in Matthew 26:42, Jesus's will is not the same as the will of the Father. Indeed, Jesus often contrasted himself with the Father, for example, in John 14:28, or Luke 18:19. Furthermore, Jesus supposedly said that the punishment for blaspheming against one part of the Trinity is not the same punishment for blaspheming against another part of the Trinity. In the Hebrew Scriptures, however, God is One, as we read in Deuteronomy 6:4, as well as in Isaiah 44:6, where God tells us, "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God." When Isaiah tells us that God said, "I am the first," it means that God has no father. When Isaiah tells us that God said, "I am the last," it means that God has no literal son. And when Isaiah tells us that God said, "Besides me there is no God," it means that God does not share being God with any other god, or demi-god, or semi-god, or persons, and there is no trinity.<br>  <br>  The Bible is clear, and it is consistent. One person cannot die for the sins of another. This means that the guilt from the sins committed by one person cannot be wiped out by the punishment given to another person. First, in Exodus 32:30-35, Moses asks God to punish him for the sin of the Golden Calf, committed by the people. God tells Moses that the person who committed the sin is the person who must receive the punishment. Then, in Deuteronomy 24:16, God simply states this as a basic principle, "Every man shall be put to death for his own sins." This concept is repeated in the Prophets, in Ezekiel 18 "The soul that sinneth, it shall die... the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him." <br>  <br>  What, EXACTLY does God say about human sacrifice in the TaNaCH? In Deuteronomy 12:30-31, God calls Human sacrifice something that He hates, and an abomination to Him, "for every abomination to the Eternal, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. In Jeremiah 19:4-6, God tells us that Human sacrifice is so horrible a concept to Him, that it did not even come into His mind to demand it from His creation, "They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind." We see the same thing in Psalm 106:37-38, and in Ezekiel 16:20. This means that God would not accept Jesus's death on the cross as a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. The very idea of that God would accept a human sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins is UnBiblical.<br>  <br>  Christians identify Messiah with Jesus and define him as God incarnated as a man, and believe he died for the sins of humanity as a blood sacrifice. This means that one has to accept the idea that one person's death can atone for another person's sins. However, this is opposed to what the Bible says in Deuteronomy 24:26, "Every man shall be put to death for his own sin," which is also expressed in Exodus 32:30-35, and Ezekiel 18. The Christian idea of the messiah also assumes that God wants, and will accept, a human sacrifice. After all, it was either Jesus-the-god who died on the cross, or Jesus-the-human. Jews believe that God cannot die, and so all that Christians are left with in the death of Jesus on the cross, is a human sacrifice. However, in Deuteronomy 12:30-31, God calls human sacrifice an abomination, and something He hates|`|HFSpKgDpaa	God has given us the power and ability to create things you can not imagine like our ability to reproduce our self, <br>  a reason why god does not reveal its self is because all depends in what your believe if you truly believe in God then you will understand me.  god wants us to believe in him he wants us to have faith in him with out having to see him.

G2yUpoqfaa	Nice words.  In the practical order you won't find a bishop on earth who will give "permission" to do it.  Nor will any pastor dare to proceed without that "permission" which, after all, is stated as the "right" of Catholics to have their Rite.  They avoid the encounter by refusing any use of the Mass of Trent (it is not called the 'latin' Mass).  Thereby, those who wish to attend the Mass of Trent are out of luck.  It is somewhat distorted in the version of the 1962 edition, which is violated by Roncalli with the addition to the Canon, and the 1965 edition, which drops 18 of the Trent prayers of the Mass!   <br>  <br>  It's a hopeless situation altogether, in spite of your quote above.
bR4BgFLlaa	The Bible, especially the Old Testament, is filled with numerous stories of animal and human sacrifice. God, we are told, likes the pleasing aroma of burning flesh. Animal sacrifice is much more common than human sacrifice, but both occur and are "pleasing to the Lord". <br>  <br>  Genesis, the first book of the Bible, has Abraham preparing to sacrifice his son to God. "Take your son, your only son – yes, Isaac, whom you love so much – and go to the land of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will point out to you." (Genesis 22:1-18) Abraham takes his own son up on a mountain and builds an altar upon which to burn him. He even lies to his son and has him help build the altar. Then Abraham ties his son to the altar and puts a knife to his throat. He then hears God tell him this was just a test of his faith. However, God still wanted to smell some burnt flesh so he tells Abraham to burn a ram.<br>  <br>  Even though he didn't kill his son, it is still an incredibly cruel and evil thing to do. If Abraham did that today he would be in jail serving a long sentence as someone's prison-*****. It amazes me how Christians see this story as a sign of God's love. There is no love here, just pure unadulterated evil.<br>  <br>  The first seven chapters of Leviticus have extensive rules regarding animal and food sacrifices. These offerings are supposed to be burnt so that God can smell them. If you read through these it seems clear to me that the priests were getting their followers to make a big feast for them every week. The priests were very particular about what kind of food to bring and how to prepare it.<br>  <br>  Even more peculiar is God's obsession with first-born sons. In Exodus 13:2 the Lord said "Consecrate to me every first-born that opens the womb among Israelites, both man and beast, for it belongs to me." Later it says that you can redeem (replace) an *** with a sheep and that you must redeem a child for an unspecified price. It is clear from the context that "consecrate" means a burning sacrifice. These priests are guilty of theft and kidnapping. Since any sins in the Old Testament were punishable by death, these priests used the threat of death to extort food and money from their followers. What do we call a scum-bag that threatens to kill your kids unless you pay a ransom? A kidnapper! If these priests were alive today they would be in prison with Abraham.<br>  <br>  However, in Leviticus 27:28-29, the Lord allows for no redemptions. "Note also that any one of his possessions which a man vows as doomed to the Lord, whether it is a human being or an animal, or a hereditary field, shall be neither sold nor ransomed; everything that is thus doomed becomes most sacred to the Lord. All human beings that are doomed lose the right to be redeemed; they must be put to death." I must admit that I am a bit confused by this contradiction, but it might only apply to slaves in your possession. Not that it makes any difference. A human sacrifice is a human sacrifice, and it is just sick.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bible Passages About Ritual Human Sacrifice<br>  <br>  <br>  Jephthah Burns His Daughter<br>  <br>  (Judges 11:29-40 NLT)<br>  <br>  <br>  God Commands Burning Humans<br>  <br>  (Joshua 7:15 NLT)<br>  <br>  <br>  Josiah and Human Sacrifice<br>  <br>  (1 Kings 13:1-2 NLT)<br>  <br>  (2 Kings 23:20-25 NLT)<br>  <br>  Human Sacrifice (Wisdom 3:5-7 NAB The Book of The Wisdom of Solomon is mostly in Catholic versions of the Bible.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Child Sacrifice<br>  <br>  (Wisdom 14:21-23 RSV) The Book of The Wisdom of Solomon is mostly in Catholic versions of the Bible.

Some of them might well have adopted those ways which is why He was so angry with them and ordered them to destroy those nations. Unfortunately they didn't entirely wipe them out and so there was a continuing problem.<br>  <br>  All the way through the Old Testament we get people rebelling against God's ways and putting up groves in which they worshipped other gods.

Everybody thinks of stereotypes when they think of something of which they are not familiar. Stereotypes are often wrong, but there is truth in them to a certain extent. Plus, when you hear of a term or place in this case, it's only natural to think of what you know about it based on what you've heard previously. I don't think it's bad to think of stereotypes, but you have to remember that there are many, many exceptions.|`|4kaOPWFeaa	sometimes but i don't believe those stereotypes. i know what you mean i hate it! i am a Californian and i always am labeled those stereotypes!

Even though i have blue eyes and blonde hair it still bugs me. <br>  <br>  My cousin went to a 7 day trip to a college in Florida during the summer. When she told them she was from California they all asumed she was 100% in style (even though she mostly is).

I3rjYVUFaa	Yes, I've suffered through it.<br>  <br>  It's in a foreign language, so you can't understand one word.<br>  <br>  That DOESN'T mean you can't understand what's happening.<br>  <br>  When they TURNED Jesus over to beat/whip/shred his flesh from the other side you could physically feel the chill over the crowd, they're going to kill this man.<br>  <br>  The beating scene has some of it in slow motion, and it makes Friday the 13th look like a food fight. If you can watch this whole movie and NOT feel emotionally moved, you have a heart of stone. Or you're sadistic, which the guards WERE.<br>  <br>  Before striking ONE blow with the whip, the guard PLAYFULLY hit the table where the commander was sitting and ripped chunks of wood off of it, laughing with anticipation as he relished what it would do to flesh. They beat this innocent man with such physical fury that the GUARDS chests heaved from exertion; no matter, they ROTATED so as to keep a fresh man beating.<br>  <br>  It's not all painful. Jesus IS a carpenter, and there is a scene in which he makes a table, and his mother asks WHAT is that for? He tells her "Trust me, this is gonna catch on"<br>  <br>  My opinion of the movie is that Mel Gibson used the communication mode of the 20th century to create a Gospel tract. This is a salvation message. I loved it; even though the brutal beating made my stomach turn.<br>  <br>  Mr. Gibson DIDN'T overdo the violence, Jesus ACTUAL suffering was MANY HOURS longer than the movie, but I believe Mel Gibson did his best to make this realistic and he accomplished his goal.<br>  <br>  Trivia: The closeup of the nails being driven through his hands, the "soldier" who does it is Mel Gibson.<br>  <br>  The Bible itself states that Jesus despised the shame, but endured the cross for the joy he knew would result:<br>  <br>  Heb 12:2  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.|`|e6t9FPUdaa	VERY good movie. It means a lot to watch it. The scene where the teardrop falls from Heaven is just as powerful as the scene where Satan is left screaming in the pit as it is finished. I couldn't think of any possible way to improve the movie, and have nothing but awe for the work. <br>  The other thing that gets me is that Mel Gibson stands up to the status quo and makes a movie that reflects his personal religious beliefs no matter what people tell him. Hollywood is very anti-Christian and he knows that having worked there for a long time. But to some people some things are more important and become a labor of love. The Passion of the Christ is one of the best ever movies.|`|mCpWSayeaa	Well, I wasn't able to see the whole thing, because I can't watch scary movies. I did have a glimpse at it, and I think the producer did a pretty good job. Satan was just as said to be. Scary, ugly, disgusting, and so on. As Jesus was resurrected, I felt I might have cried. It was cruel what they did to him, and they couldn't give any really good answers.|`|5ac5b76d7f8ed84c1048c43e47d56ae5aa	As a Christian, I  understand  that Jesus suffered and died, for us. <br>  <br>  I do not believe there is  any justice in  witnessing  a reenactment of the event.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am Protestant.<br>  <br>  I saw the movie. I shouldn't have. <br>  <br>  I do not agree with Mr. Gibson's choice in representing 'demons' as physical entities. <br>  <br>  I do not have any faith in 'evil spirit'. <br>  <br>  I know of only One Spirit. For Christ's sake.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Yeah, when I was like 14. Didn't feel anything then even though at time I believed that god existed and that Jesus was the Messiah. It was just really gross, and that's coming from a huge 'Saw' fan.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	yes.<br>  it was gross.  Watching a man being tortured.<br>  Nice that every good christian felt a need to bring their children to see it.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	I born Japan, see part  on DVD, not understand it, too bloody, turn off TV.|`|YJ5kPI8baa	A two and a half hour snuff flick. It was crap.|`|vOBuQ5l2aa	I saw it, but wasn't a big fan. I thought the music was real good and the production value was nice, and I guess if you're obsessed with all the brutalities of crucifixion, then it's a nice graphic depiction...? Personally, I don't need to see a movie to know it sucks to get flogged and nailed to some coarse wood before suffocating to death.<br>  <br>  My main problem was that there was very little actual story presented. Basically, you had a two-hour torture scene that was momentarily interrupted by flashbacks that you would only understand if you were familiar with the source material.|`|hchHxyseaa	The truth is that the Crucifixion was more horrified than what is shown in the film.  If you read the Gospel, you will find the horrible death he took on our behalf to forgive us and bridge the gap to reach God.  Without which there is no way of Salvation.  If this is gross, can you imagine the what it was like for Him?  Still people do not heed to the Gospel and harden their hearts.  I sincerely hope this question will lead people to think and ponder upon our Savior and to accept Him as our personal Savior.|`|yMVdKHhmaa	it was thought provoking, whether its a true depiction of what actually happened to Jesus we'll never know. but for sure The Romans did carry out those acts on people, many people, and the sad part is that humans are capable of such heinous acts.<br>  <br>  How can one human inflict such pain upon another.|`|ZH58ckgjaa	A good and perfect person such as Him, was willing to go through all that pain for a stupid sinner like me. I'm not perfect, I have flaws and regrets... but He still died for me out of Love.<br>  <br>  They say success is what we should all aim for, but I always find myself dissatisfied with what I accomplished; like I missed perfection. However Jesus, loves me perfectly as I am. Nothing I can do will make Him love me more or less.<br>  <br>  And that's the beauty of the message.|`|zkCnArG0aa	it was a snuff film<br>  <br>  was grotesque and horrid and really had nothing to do with the religion it pretended to represent.|`|AA11579650	it was overexaggerated.|`|b1Fr373gaa	I thought it was gangsta|`|5y38Pdtiaa	no|`|eAMq1iBWaa	It is catholic through and through|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	As far as entertainment value goes it wasn't entertaining. However, I don't think Mel Gibson meant for it to be entertaining. It was more like a history lesson presented on the big screen. I did like the acting, props, and special effects. The foreign language bit was a nice touch too. I am a Christian so I thought it was wonderful. I think some people took it a little to seriously in the theater though because some were praying and crying. Nevertheless I did learn alot from the movie even though it had an obviously Catholic attribute. My favorite scene is when Jesus is being questioned by pilate. Since you brought it up I may have to watch it tonight.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Yes.  My honest opinion?  It's been over hyped and is melodramatic at times but it was OK.  I thought having the dialog in Aramaic was a gimmick that tended to distance the non Aramaic speaking members of the audience (which is just about everyone) from events in the movie.  As for the blood, other films have told the same story successfully without being as graphic.  If you want a movie that will basically tell you the same story you have heard since a child then this is as good a movie as any.  However if you want to see a film that is more compelling, that delves into the psyche of Jesus then I would recommend the Last Temptation of Christ.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i saw it!<br>  <br>  there are several great Movies of jesus. there are few really bad ones. This movie was not BAD. <br>  <br>  i wonder where Mel gibson got the idea of jesus stepping on the serpent, especially in the garden. while the demon-children harassed Judas and pushed him to commit suicide. He claimed that these things have their sources. <br>  <br>  i dont believe the entire country spoke Aramaic. especially when i read the gospel which says Pilate wrote on the piece of wood in Greek, and hebrew and latin.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	The one thing I appreciated about the movie was it didn't hold anything back.<br>  <br>  For too long the church cushioned the crucifixion to appease those who disliked violence. It made people luke warm and apathetic to what jesus suffered for our sakes and most still do not fully understand what Jesus really did for the sinner in us all.|`|FmazIF6Maa	It wasn't meaningful to me, any more than any other fiction.

And if I find that resentment dwelling in me, I pray that God root it out.<br>  <br>  It's a killer, resentment.  It can do horrible things to you.

I believe God has everyone be wronged in some way by someone else to test us and to see if we will choose to forgive or not to forgive.

It's easy for me to let something go and not want revenge because if you think about it revenge is the highest compliment you can ever give to someone.

I think practice does help.|`|UR4mWefGaa	I forgive, but it is awful damn hard to forget.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	I am Christian, and maybe in the past I was a grudge holder, and a person who was very hard at forgiving-example, my father who I haven't see in 15 yrs now, although just recently I have gotten in touch with my half brothers, and now James (my father) knows I exist again...<br>  <br>  I am a different person then I was years ago.  I was a "lukewarm" Christian who just decided that I wasn't all that into God.<br>  But things have changed for me, and at this point in time in my life, I do not find it at all hard to forgive because I take it to the Lord in prayer and let all my feelings go.  Talking to him about it and praying takes all that weight off and I feel better.|`|0lFvJXbXaa	I'm a very forgiving person in most circumstances, if you sincerely ask me for forgiveness I will always give it to you. I can think of a handful of things a person could do that I could never forgive, but most are bad enough I wouldn't have a problem killing someone for them if I caught them, maybe that's my vice. I can't forgive the REALLY bad things, especially involving children or people that are weak in general. Not going into details though..|`|AQIhcBiuaa	I do forgive but it is difficult sometimes. I know that we are told to just hand it over to God. That is sometimes easy to say and hard to do. When that happens to me I pray and ask God to help me to be strong enough to forgive and to help me to let it Go and release it all to him. One thing that helped me is that I have learned to pray FOR the person who wronged me.|`|2SroATikaa	I know it isnt easy for me to forgive. I recently finally found to forgive my mother for giving me an ill omen for a name.|`|5y38Pdtiaa	it depends. i have a bad memory and don't care enough to really hold grudges|`|zXfA7yYoaa	I always let it go, and congratulations!<br>  i'm guessing you had a baby! lol|`|9VJV2Dcvaa	It depends..... but I won't lie to you: most of the times, it takes a while to forgive somebody......|`|42d1de7ff8420f02c887feec3a13ae5baa	If they ask...I usually do.

MhfneF0xaa	Just explain to him that you are straight, and that he is making you uncomfortable. If you want him as just a friend, tell him that, too.<br>  <br>  If he keeps on making you uncomfortable, then he doesn't want you as just a friend.

252ab75f8df2aaa8b03c0bca4bc85675aa	These things are indeed given to pendulum swings. After the severe repressions earlier in the 20th century a sense of wild abandon and license set in with the heady days of gay liberation in the late 60s through the 70s. This in turn was followed by a kind of "gay prudery"  which was in fashion for a while after the onset of the epidemic back in the late 80s early 90s. None of this restraint was due to induced religious morality. <br>  <br>  The fear has abated somewhat since then and standards somewhat relaxed due to ongoing anti-retroviral treatments.Any resurgence of restraint that may be emerging out of a sense of modesty and growing responsiblity will almost certainly be due to the ongoing campaign for marriage equality. I do not think that translates into gays flocking to any christian church which has tradtionally been a toxic place for gays. Neo-Paganism may fill the void, but I do not see this as growing social phenomenon yet.<br>  <br>  Time will tell, and we may yet see other swings of the pendulum. But I wouldn't bet on gays  being "lured" back to the christian church.|`|CDft5bscaa	I think the idea of gay and lesbian people waiting until marriage in significant numbers and gay and lesbian youth doing the whole promise ring thing is much less far fetched than it once was<br>  <br>  that's not to say that were going to return en masse to the sexual mores of some earlier era, it will just be more of a diverse mix|`|nuCXcLUIaa	I think as religion slowly dies out, "No sex until marriage" will as well, alongside homophobia.|`|r6fGmJK1aa	Why can't it happen now?  If two people do not want to have sex, then they can agree to that. Just cause we are gay, does not mean we do not have morals! <br>  <br>  My partner and I waited to have sex until we were in a committed relationship. I know marriage in the US is a long way off, so waiting to have sex until married, we would never have sex!  In our eyes we are all ready married to each other.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	Personally I dont think " no sex b4 marraige " will ever make a comeback in todays society. Straight or Gay,.
eAMq1iBWaa	Jesus spoke these words to His original apostles. He was telling them they would have to leave families, jobs, money, everything - to follow Him.<br>  <br>  And they did!<br>  <br>  The Greek word for hate here actually means to love less|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO, it is a widely used Eastern idiom. Have you noticed that you never see the word 'prefer' in literal translations ! Why ? Because it is expressed by the word 'hate' and the lesser thing(s). <br>  <br>  It means two things<br>  1) God has top priority, and<br>  2) You love the people in your life best by going along with God's Will.<br>  <br>  Remember, that applies to the people listed too.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	it means that you should be ready to believe the word of God even when it s not popular to do so like obeying these  verses; 1corinthians 14:34-35 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.<br>  <br>  35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	While I agree in part with Selah I see it as more as a comparison.  Jesus was not saying hate them as much as he was saying love God so much more that the only way to compare the two is hatred.  Simply put no matter how much you love those dear to you love God more.|`|2WnbP80Taa	it simply means not to put others in front of God.  Loving your husband more than God, Loving material things before God.  God will always be with you, all others will die an earthly death one day.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	In that text the original word for hate meant 'love less'.

YVJQ7Y4jaa	Seems like all actors, by osmosis seem to have all the answers to everything. This crime of abortion dwarfs the combined slaughter of the Soviet Union and the Nazi government. It is a crime against humanity.<br>  If you open your eyes, just a little, you will see the lack of any morality or respect for life.  Politicians teach our young that it is OK to take bribes, lie under oath, deny the existence of God, Fornicate, Have an ethics committee without ethics, spit on our troops, surrender our country, thereby, dishonoring our war dead. This is only the beginning.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Oh for the FSM, using stem cells is not mass murder of unborn babies. Besides, we no longer need to use fetal stem cells. Through genetic engineering, we can use skin cells to turn them back into stem cells. <br>  <br>  What about those blastocysts which are thrown away in IVF clinics? Isn't that murder, according to you?<br>  <br>  But to call it murder, the victim must have personhood. A fetus or a blastocyst, does not have personhood.|`|qbelhflAaa	Blah, blah, blah. I have more important things to worry about, sorry.<br>  <br>  Anyway, they're embryos. Not children. Big difference.|`|WcxrnINvaa	embryonic stem cells used are ones that were going to be flushed away if not used, so can't see how it'd be mass murder.|`|8IyZphFVaa	the president has separated morality and respect for human life? what exactly do you think happens to the dead fetuses? you think the doctors give them some kind of burial? they're thrown away like trash. just think of this like you'd think of someone who donates their organs after death.|`|lcvhhGjpaa	Stem cell research can take place on adult stem cells and stem cells removed from foetuses in the womb that are not aborted. <br>  <br>  Also embryonic stem cell research from 'unfertilised eggs'.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/topics/stem-cells">http://news.yahoo.com/topics/stem-cells</a><br>  <br>  No abortion has to take place.<br>  <br>  So basically you are spouting BS.|`|faT4MyVkaa	It beats just throwing the dead fetuses away.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are interested in "talking about an issue", you might want to stick away from the flaming hyperbole of "federal funding of unborn child mass murder"|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Frozen, fertilized eggs aren't human life.

I personally would not choose abortion<br>  but then again I'm not always against it. I once shared a hospital room with a 12 year-old retarded girl that got pregnant because her Uncle raped her. Her religious parents forced her to have the child so it might be placed for adoption. This girl was so traumatized. I thought in her case abortion would have been appropriate. I also knew a drug addicted woman who opted for abortion. There will always be abortion wether we all agree on it or not. So,if some good can come of it through stem cell research then so be it.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	"unborn >child< mass murder " you misspelled fetus<br>  "FOR >HUMAN< LIFE" you did it again<br>  <br>  Abortion is league and horrible as it should be.

Science and the LAW do not consider a group of embryonic cells a human life.  That is all that matters in this case.<br>  <br>  Have you never heard of separation of church and state?<br>  <br>  You are quite delusional if you think harvesting organs from living humans by force is the same thing as using left over embryos from invitro in order to further scientific research.  Only religious zealots think life begins at conception.  The law does not.  Our laws do state that forced organ harvest from the living is wrong so unless you live in some post apocalyptic mad max like section of North America that I don't know about than I am pretty sure your comparison is as extremist as your views on stem cell research.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	There are stem cells from adults that they can use, that is just as effective as embryonic stem cells.  I am so far, the only one that agrees with you. Frozen embryos are not just a bunch of cells, sorry for those who think so.  They may have discarded them - however was it EVER right for the embryos to be in the position that they would need discarding?  Don't think so.  Morality and respect for human life, has hit a new low.  Some may have not liked Bush, but I can tell you this, He respected human life. Science is not God- but people have started to treat Science like it is. Sad day!!!|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I think Obama is perfectly right. Stem cell research can do so much good; it's ridiculous to call it "unborn child mass murder." The people who call it that are absolutely, and perversely, ignorant.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, stem cell research is not going to randomly engender more crime. I fail to see how medical research equates to more people murdering and raping and stealing. The connection is ludicrous.

Its not all too effective, though, for it takes a while to heal, you are opening up the ability for infection, and it concerns people. Even though it is a quick fix, I advise against it.

6ead7e745899491ccfd40dbc9c7d5ef6aa	1. I don't believe that the media's intention is to stop blacks from progressing. In my opinion, I see it as their way of calling a truce with blacks, endeavoring to show unity and peace among races.<br>  <br>  2. In my opinion, yes. Black women are more practical. Our strength is our drive to pass down traditions and value hard work.<br>  <br>  3. I think that the western world is somewhat more advance than other parts of the world when it comes to social issues. In places where exists communism or lack of freedom, it would be harder to accept the unfamiliar.<br>  <br>  4. Of course. I think you can find any type of relationship in all races. Its not the color of your skin that brings two people together, its their character and personalities. So if two people, one being black and one being white, have a falling out, the REAL problem isn't the difference in skin color. The REAL problem is how those people were raised, who influenced them, what their opinions are and what sort of person they are on the inside.<br>  <br>  5. Its not just blacks who need to get their act together. Its whites, asians, indians, hispanics- MANKIND in general. Now if this were to happen, would i be in favor of seperatism? Not at all. I'm neutral when it comes to those affairs.<br>  <br>  6. Self hate?! Absolutely not. My boyfriend is white. I wasn't looking for a white man, or even a man at all, but it happened and I fell in love with HIM, not his skin color. You can't choose love. Love chooses you.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	1.No<br>  <br>  2.

No<br>  <br>  2) are black women better homemakers(cooks,sewers etc) no<br>  <br>  3)why is it that many parts of the western world are ok with interracial dating while eastern europeans and asians dint. is it because westerners are ahead in their thinking or are they destroying their cultures and traditions with race mixing? NO, most of those cultures and traditions are carried even with mixing. Remember culture and traditions are just information that can be duplicated. I think we are ahead with our thinking though when it comes this stuff.<br>  <br>  4) can black and white people have real friendships that last a life time and are 100% honest? yes there are plenty of interracial couples that do this everyday.<br>  <br>  5)if black people got their act together 100% to the point where they did not need outsiders for anything would you be in favour of bringing separatism back? no! this wouldn't allow for a freddom of knowledge and people<br>  <br>  6) with all the interracial dating between black men and white women is it really deep down self hate? no, Like the saying goes. What the world needs now is love sweet love and there isn't any other human love more powerful than the love of man and woman!|`|57oHulIDaa	...<br>  1. I think showing interracial couples on tv and on other types of media, do not show Blacks in a negative way. I don't really think its a bad thing to date interracially.<br>  2. It depends on which Black woman you are talking about. Because of all the "mammy" stereotypes, that have been on tv since before the 40's, I suppose some people who actually listen to and believe stereotypes would think so, but I think being a better homemaker is not determined by how much melanin your skin cells contain.<br>  3. I wouldn't say that Westerners are further ahead intellectually than Easterners in concerns with interracial dating, because some Easterners are okay with interracial dating. But, I do believe that interracial dting does not mean that you are "destroying your race", it's everyone's personal preference who they want to date, and if that person happens date outside of their race, that's their choice. I have no right to judge.<br>  4. Yes they can<br>  5. Not all Black people need to get their act together, some do, but most are perfectly capable of getting ahead in America without depending on other people for help. If some of the Black people that do need to get their act together, got it together, I strongly disagree that we should bring separatism back. We are all human with different amounts of melanin in our cells, different hair textures, and facial features, but the point is we are all humans, so we should be together and unite as a human race.<br>  6. I'm sure many Black men that date white  women, do not like Black women, but again, as I said before, that is their personal preference, and I can't judge them or change them for liking who they want to like. But also, many Blakc men that date white women, are nto dating them specifically because they are white, they are dating them because they love them for more than what their race is.<br>  <br>  haha, this answer is so long. :)|`|CvSKPHiqaa	1- in some ways. yes<br>  <br>  2- depends on the woman. african women-99% of the time yes<br>  <br>  3-they feel like its inevitable. many people are still not ok with it though<br>  <br>  4-yeh sure. i have white friends<br>  <br>  5-not complete separatism but i do believe that we should take examples from the asians and jews and provide for our communities more. <br>  <br>  6-most of it is in my honest opinion. some isn't|`|ht5CQV04aa	1) Interracial dating is bad regardless<br>  2) Yes sir<br>  3) Yep<br>  4) Absolutely not<br>  5) We need to separate America lets face it we are not getting along<br>  6) YES SIR!!!

2Hot9EJiaa	RELIGIONS- man's attempt to find God<br>  RELATIONSHIP- God's way to find and save man, through Christ|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Christianity is a religion, but there are far more religions than just Christianity. Religious Americans aren't just Christian, though the vast majority are Christians. There are American Muslims, Hindus, Baha'is, Wiccans, Pagans, Sikhs, Satanists, and others.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, there is a difference between generic religious people and Christian people. Religious people can be any number of religions, but Christian people belong to one specific religion, called Christianity. Not all religious people are Christians, but all Christians are religious people because they belong to the Christian religion.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus is a relationship!  :D  Jesus loves you so very much, and He wants a personal relationship with you<br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|paRGbr7Xaa	....you are aware that there is more than one religion, right? There's Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Paganism, Baha'i, Shinto, Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, Sikhism, and hundreds of thousands of more.|`|bda65b4ff72feb24ddd4bbe8bda19e51aa	Are you kidding me? Christianity is a religion. There are a lot more religions than Christianity.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	Religion is humans trying to reach up to GOD(YHVH)<br>  Christianity is GOD(YHVH) reaching down to us.|`|7ca5c6cf814ffe44b145b050ae60323aaa	Christianity is a religion in the sense of the definition of religion.  It has practices and principles that those who follow it adhere to.  It doesn't take much to make a religion.  Atheism is a religion.  Psychology is a religion.  When you read the definition or religion, that's what they are.  Wicca is a religion.  So there is no difference between religion and Christianity in the sense you are using those words.<br>  <br>  However, there is a difference between religious Christians and non-religious Christians.  Many Christians will be upset by this, but the non-religious Christians aren't really Christians.  They don't follow the teachings.  They don't listen to their teachers.  They don't submit to governmental authority.  They don't honor their parents.  They live sin filled lives and trust that God will be gracious enough to forgive them without them having to repent and lead a right life.  They will holler and scream that I am talking about works and that no one can be perfect and give lots of thumbs down, but the gospel they preach is nowhere to be found in scripture.<br>  <br>  Real religion, as it says in James 1, is meeting the needs of widows and orphans in their affliction.  Wearing the right clothes, having the right job, marrying the right person, and saying the right prayers are worthless if you aren't doing what Jesus did.  Religion, man made religion, is all about working to be good enough for God.  It's making sure everyone sees how pious you are and how holy you are and how much different you are than wretched sinners.  Real religion is humble and it is kind.  It is selfless and seeks to draw near to God to learn from him and be provided for by him.  Religion, in its purest form, is doing the will of God, just as Jesus did.  Christianity is the result of following Jesus, not a badge you wear regardless of what your life looks like.  Salvation is a work of God's grace in your life.<br>  <br>  When you define religion very broadly, there is no difference.  When you define religion like Webster's, attitudes, beliefs, and practices, or commitment and devotion, you actually eliminate many Christians from calling themselves religious because they aren't devoted to anything but themselves.  Then again, by definition that's a religion too.|`|l7KNCARGaa	well, Shirley, I think the difference is a real relationship with the Messiah!<br>  <br>  Please email me because I need to tell you something that will surprise you *wink*<br>  <br>  God bless,<br>  <br>  Mrs. S.|`|d4L1vqxEaa	What do you mean what is the difference?<br>  There are tons of religions.

Jesus did say that anyone who corrupts a child deserves to be drowned - you could certainly apply that to child molestation today even if that's not what he had in mind at the time.<br>  <br>  The Bible also doesn't say taking drugs is wrong either. However, the law is pretty clear on that.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Why are you asking atheists?  We have no use for the bible and don't believe a word of it, anyway.  <br>  There's also probably nothing in there about beating the crap out of your wife, either.  Even good guys in the bible offer their daughters and wives for sex with other men in exchange for something.<br>  Edit:  Smoothie, you're deluding yourself.  And if the Old Testament was good enough for Jesus, who are you to disregard it?   I guess you'd rather ignore it than try to defend or explain it.|`|iou7nV3Kaa	We live in the New Testament today. God doesn't punish or judge you when you do wrong. We have choices, and if we choose to do the wrong thing, those wrong choices lead to bad situations like jail and electric chair etc.. It's not God who does these bad things to us, it's us. He loves us so much. Satan tempts people to do wrong things, and if we listen to him, bad things happen.

3nV91UY4aa	CherryLipz,<br>  <br>  A "basic level attraction" is that which everyone finds attractive.

He meant it is a compliment.<br>  <br>  Unless, he meant it in a sour way, that you have a "basic level of attractiveness" which could mean you have average looks.

Most people who call themselves pastors and such are pretentious idiots.  <br>  <br>  After you have dedicated all you are to the God you are trying to find, or to the Whole, or Source...  After you have found the inner peace that passes all understanding...  then you will be ready to walk in service to others.   <br>  <br>  That service can be done by any Human who has dedicated their entire soul to Creator.  And any religion that kicks them out or says "You can not love others or serve others in OUR building" is not of the truth and not of God.   "He that loveth not does not know God.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|eNaSiUsZaa	kind of retarded|`|phxPTfu7aa	that was the bargian. to live for ever you must steak from others what keeps them alive. meaning we must take the blood to live. but seeing as not even death can teach us we do as we please with it. but blood shouldn't be taken in my humans. no bad with the sicknesses that go around today i wouldn't do it if i were human. but i'm not human.
2PZnXjZ7aa	Let me start from the beginning...<br>  The Mayans were an ancient civilization, and very advanced. They knew the world was round, the true length of the year, etc. Their specialty was astronomy. They were able to plot a calender up to thousands of years. Heck, they could even have kept going if they wanted to. Yet, they ended it on December 21th, 2012...<br>  Like most civilizations, the Mayans had their own religion and their own Gods. They believed that three worlds were created before ours. Each was destroyed because it's humans were defective and didn't worship the gods. We've only lasted so long because are the true people, made out of maize, a sacred corn to the Mayan. They say the end of this world is (you guessed it) December 21th, 2012!<br>  Along with this, there's several other things happening in 2012. First off, the planets are going to put on a little show for us! A few planets are going to line up. Alas, this occurs at noon, so I don't know if we'll see it. There's also a possible reversal of Earth's magnetic field. Research for some more if you'd like.<br>  Now I'll inform you 'bout some past parallel prophecies. A notable one is Nostradamus, the most famous end-time prophet. He saw visions or premonitions, and tried his best to put them into words. True, they're not specifically linked to 2012. Apparently, a comet will come, coinciding with earthquakes and other natural disasters. Also mentioned is a conjunction of the planets. Some interpret the words to describe a polar shift. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Anyways, the Earth changes bring famine, drought, and social upheaval. Civilization will be changed. Continents will split apart with waterways. Powerful nations will be weakened. The soical upheave will allow an antichrist to come to power.<br>  The Book of Revelation in the Bible is one of the best-known texts on end times. It talks about seven seals/scrolls opening, each with an event happening. Then, four angels appear and release winds of destruction. They're told to hold back the winds until Christ puts a seal on the foreheads of 144,000 worthy servants of God who will not be touched by the destruction. This also tells of an antichrist who will achieve world domination. The antichrist will rule until the battle of the Armaggeddon. At this point, Jesus returns to Earth, the 144,000 are sent to heaven, and Christ destorys the armies of the antichrist, who is thrown into a lake of fire. As this happens to Earth, a war is in heaven as well. Angels fight Satan, who is also thrown into the lake of fire.<br>  Edgar Cayce has been told as one of the greatest prophets of all time. He said that the end time would come within the next generation of his period, meaning around 1958 and 1998. Of course, it didn't happen. His basic prophecy fits, but the only relation to time ending in 2012 is the possible polar shift. Here's some hightlights of his end-time prophecy: The Atlantis and Pacific coats of America will be altered. New York city, San Fransico, and Los Angeles will disappear. Russia will become the spiritual hope of the world. Intense Earthquakes will destory California and the Baja peninsula will diappear. The Pacific ocrean will near Arizona and Nebraska. Mount Etna will erupt, signaling the sign of real changes. The Great Lakes will drain into the Gulf thorugh the Mississippi. Japan will go under sea. There will be a pole shift and ice caps will melt, meaning flooding. And new lands will rise out of the ocean, along with lost lands such as Atlantis.<br>  Now let's go to the Skeptic's Corner! There are several problems with 2012 predictions. Many do not come with dates and are vague. If a prediction does come with a date, it turns out to be wrong. What's the purpose of a prediction? Like Nostadamus. Many of his predictions are realized to be true until after it's happened. Useful, huh? The theory of the pole shift is an application of bad science. Have you heard of self-fullining prophecies? A child spills milk on himself, and thinks of himself as accident-prone. Then, several more accidents happen since he damaged his self-confidence. The prophecy is fulfilled. Remember this with 2012.<br>  In case you do indeed believe that the world could end in 2012 and you're scared, here's a bit of advice. It's no accident that you were born in this specific time of history. You were born ot be here. Perhaps you're meant to see the world as it ends. How do you know if this is true? Well, asking about 2012 is the first sign! <br>  Oh, and if you want my opinion on the matter... I suppose something will happen. It's not nessecarily the end of the world, but a new beginning! It's all 'bout rebirth, baby. Whether our DNA is getting a wake up call or fire will rain from the sky, 2012 is signifigant. Just overrated.<br>  I hope I've explained this all well enough.

If they didn't want to be challenged or want to believe they wouldn't be on this site. Of course there are people who have nothing better to do and just want to be belligerent. It also makes no sense to be an atheists and in fact it's much more easier to believe and if your spiritual practice brings you a happy life then there is nothing wrong with believing. <br>  <br>  7.

Without it anything goes because people who do not believe in Christ also don't believe there is a difference between right and wrong or good or bad, it is the desire of many non-believers to remove the consequences of ill actions in the attempt to out smart, out wit, or out right defy the laws of God while denying the effects their actions have on their fellow human beings. (Every action gets a reaction, whether it effects you personally or not).<br>  4. I would be very disappointed and strongly believe humanity was doomed to destroy itself by means of insanity eventually.<br>  5. No<br>  6. Not for me to say what Atheists believe.<br>  7. I don't know if there is an afterlife, I don't know if there is a God, I only know that when the basic moral standards outlined within the bible are not upheld in society someone always gets hurt, and it is not my desire to go around hurting people, so I do my best to uphold these principals.<br>  8. I believe we create our own destinies to an extent, but 50% of where we end up is determined by chance because we can't control the actions of others around us, and no matter how hard you work or try, other people are always needed to complete your goals.<br>  9. No, I am definitely not one of the chosen people. My life has been very difficult and I contribute most of my difficulties to my belief system because doing what is right is never the easy road to take and is often looked down upon or considered stupid or treated like a mental illness by the majority of society.

Sinners even with only one lie are sinners and will not be accepted into Heaven. God loves us and provided the escape through Jesus who died in our place so that by accepting Him we can live forever. There is no other way. See John 3;16-36 and John 14:6.If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to believe<br>  Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be willing to<br>  turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the Bible and<br>  owning Him before others.

Humans are unlike animals, which are described in the Bible as “unreasoning,” or as “creatures of instinct.” (2?Peter 2:12; New International Version) We bury our dead. We contemplate the future. We do not want to grow old, get sick, and die. Yet, these are realities of human experience.<br>  We are sobered by death’s approach, whether our own or that of a loved one. The Bible, however, encourages us to face death courageously, saying: “Better is it to go to the house of mourning than to go to the banquet house.” It adds: “The one alive should take it to his heart.” (Ecclesiastes 7:2) Why take death to heart, or reflect deeply on the matter?<br>  For one reason, we have an inborn desire to live and enjoy life in peace and security. Death—nonexistence—is inherently repulsive. It is difficult, if not almost impossible, to accept. The Bible explains why: “[God] has put eternity into man’s mind,” or “in their heart.” (Ecclesiastes 3:11; Revised Standard Version) We want to live—not die. Think about it: Would that desire be so strong if it were not our Creator’s original purpose for us to live forever? Is another life in endless health and happiness possible?<br>  Reason to Believe<br>  Last year, AARP The Magazine, published by the American Association of Retired Persons, featured the article “Life After Death.” Interviews of scores of people who were over 50 years of age revealed that “nearly three quarters (73?percent) agree with the statement ‘I believe in life after death.’” On the other hand, the magazine reported that nearly one quarter agreed with the statement “I believe that when I die, that’s the end.” But is that what people really want to believe?<br>  In the same article, Tom, a Catholic from New York, was reported to have said: “They preach life after death, you know? I just say, hey, people preach a lot of stuff. You just gotta make up your own mind about things. I go to Mass. I live my life like there’s life after death, but I don’t believe there is. If it’s true, well, hey, it’s a plus.”<br>  Like Tom, many are skeptical—as was the father mentioned at the outset, who would often say to his son, “Belief in religion is OK for those who can’t handle the reality of death.” Yet, as he and other skeptics have had to acknowledge, belief in an all-powerful Creator provides an answer to otherwise incomprehensible miracles.<br>  For example, just three weeks after conception, the human embryo begins to form brain cells. These cells multiply in spurts, at times up to a quarter of a million of them a minute! Nine months later a baby is born with a brain that has a miraculous capacity to learn. Molecular biologist James Watson called the human brain “the most complex thing we have yet discovered in our universe.”<br>  When considering marvels like this, are you—as most are—filled with awe? Have such reflections helped you arrive at an answer to the question raised by a man long ago: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again?” That man answered God confidently: “You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”—Job 14:14,?15.|`|wcQUjSUOaa	I think it will be Okay. It's as natural as birth. Maybe I'll have some regrets but that would not be unusual.
ACjzwLHraa	Not at all! In fact, Koreans tend to truly appreciate it when a non-Korean tries to speak their language. It shows that you care and that you are interested in the culture, and that's always a good thing. Never, ever be afraid to speak it. However, as you're starting out, always remember to add "yo" to the end of everything you say, even if you're responding with a one-word answer. This ensures that you won't accidentally offend anybody.|`|mpsYdkHTaa	They would love to hear some Korean<br>  Visit <a href="http://cours.coreen.free.fr" rel="nofollow">http://cours.coreen.free.fr</a> for a free online Korean course.|`|AA10789931	Not being Korean, but in my opinon if a person started talking in my native language it would be intresting.

Women and men both can connect themselves to the same sex as a way of feeling more secure or safe.  Those relationships are not healthy, whereas people who are born gay have healthy relationships.<br>  <br>  The gay people who are that way because of life experiences can be helped.  They can get psychiatric help, raise their self-esteem, and learn to be more secure in themselves. Then they will realize they want to be with the opposite sex.  People who are born gay can never be straight, and are healthy and happy with the same sex.

To keep my answer short, I just want to say that even scholars have studied the bible and it's claims and they have discovered that lot's of what it says can and did happen. Another key point about it is that, even though there are so many books within the bible written by different people at different times in different writing styles, they all agree with each other, which also gives some more validity to what it says. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be so fast to call all religious people, christian or otherwise, retards without having done you're research into it and with no understanding about what they're beliefs even are. <br>  <br>  oh, and as for your dog and bird argument.. there are tones of dogs and birds and many many other animals in the wild who get by just fine with God's provision.|`|hCcBKOrFaa	I agree religion is a key to human suffering as well as Wealth and aggression.

If you believe it has a soul from the moment of conception, then yes, I believe that child would go to heaven - it hasn't sinned, it's pure (and yes, I am denying Original Sin). If you believe the soul comes at a later point, and you abort before that point, then it's not going anywhere, really - but that's a huge debate that's been going for centuries.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that the abortion can be justified that way, though. You're still robbing that child of a life on earth, and that counts as murder.<br>  <br>  Oh btw - William I - it's limbo and it's now been abolished... you can blame Saint Augustine for it in the first place (silly idea - he was a gynophobic nutter).|`|NqJDWKDPaa	It depends on your denomination.

This was a requirement of the Jews under the Kingdom Gospel and program.<br>  <br>  The apostle Paul, who gives us the Gospel of the Grace of God, teaches us that there is ONE baptism (Eph. 4:5), one faith, one Lord, etc. This baptism is when we are baptized into the Body of Christ, at the moment we believe this gospel of grace, and in Christ's finished work on the cross.

When reading the old testament most people are turned away by the violence that they read not knowing that its a fight between good and evil.<br>  <br>  Christianity carries alot of negative history as well, about the crusades and other horrible times in history that depict religion as being cruel and controlling. But these are the birth pains, and not the real truth about our faith.<br>  <br>  Sine then Christianity has changed noticeably, but nothing like old memories to ruin something that is necessary for salvation. But this is how the enemy works, he destroys all that he can which upholds truth.|`|wwdllMzYaa	because christianty thinks negatively about most people<br>  <br>  it may seem untrue to you,but , maybe thats because your looking at it from your own view, not from everyoen elses whos not a christian<br>  <br>  we dont need "saved" from our lives thanks, we are perfectly able enough to do waht we want<br>  its our life, you do what you want, we will do what we want<br>  and tahts as it shoudl be<br>  i dont want to "save" you, why do you feel the need to "save" me|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I appreciate your last sentance.

514399d4937bf06c6e1d2828adbebde4aa	1. "Velkomin/n aftur" or "Velkomin/n til baka" - both are correct. I use "velkomin aftur" more though and i think it is more common.

"real quick" is "mj?g fljótt" but you would never say "ég kem rétt strax mj?g fljótt" you would rather say "ég vere mj?g sn?gg/ur" or "ég vere mj?g fljót/ur" which are "i'll be real quick".<br>  <br>  4.

wwdllMzYaa	well, i think you may be<br>  <br>  being an asperger is beign an individual with the same problem as other people with aspergers<br>  <br>  so your stil an individual, your aspergers still affects you in different ways<br>  not all aspergers are the same, or at the same level on the A.S.D<br>  <br>  you soudn liek you are doing well, which is great to hear,<br>  my boyf is an asperger too, and he apppears to have moved up the A.S.D scale a little and is also further along than most aspergers<br>  <br>  unbeleivably, he has even reached a stage where he can acutally converse, normally, with peopel, for a time<br>  its pretty amazing<br>  his hygene is on and off, as logn as i keep an eye on him ;-D<br>  <br>  so as i said, your all different, and your a.s affects you all in a different way, you can know if your further along than others, i think, if you judge how you were before, and how you are now<br>  as we do with my boyf<br>  <br>  its based on YOUR personal changes, not how different you are to other aspergers<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|BevylvVSaa	Asperger syndrome is a label - don't let it define who you are and what you are capable of. Be the best person you can be. If you compare yourself to others with AS - postively or negatively it will constantly stymy your true spirit within.|`|9a35060b1f035af576ef9d57f250b28aaa	I think you doing fine as long as the financial matter doesn't pressure you.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	i'd put you somewhere in teh middle--successful---and improving<br>  <br>  there is another aspie I know who thinks Aspergers is Severe and SSI is his only option....Personally I think its not teh Aspergers that is severe, but that he has severe anxiety with it (worse than most aspies)..<br>  <br>  I just can't convince him-that it relation to other disabilities--Aspergers isn't bad---most people are smart and learn to compensate--and make it appear that their disability is Mild...especially with technology opening up more work options.<br>  <br>  Many people have aspergers--and have been succesful--without even knowing they had a disabiity--many middle age adults who have been successful are just finding out now that they have aspergers--often when tehy have a child diagnosed on the austim spectrum.<br>  <br>  I have a cousin that I suspect has aspergers--he is married and has adopteed children (infertility problems)...he did have a 'language disorder as a preschooler--but that was gone by kindergarten.....|`|XHmz4R99aa	Don't worry about comparing yourself to anybody else.<br>  Don't let the label hold you down. People with AS also have qualities that makes them outstanding. They can achieve a lot more than "normal" people, because you are special. I am sure you've heard Einstein, DaVinci, etc, have some kind of syndromes as well, and that they achieved what they achieved in part because of their differences. Just like Bill gates dropping out of school because he probably can't stand to conform to the educational system, but look at him now. (not a vote for dropping out of school mind you.)<br>  <br>  In short don't use the label they put on you as an excuse for slacking of, but use it to your advantage. Don't let anybody tell you, you can't do something because of it. Work hard, have fun and be happy. Be a good person, everything will come in place.|`|VjkDIvezaa	I'm 21 &  in my 3rd year at college  with aspergers syndrome too. and I think I am further along than other people with it.

It's just a label that someone came up with. I'll offer this advice. Don't ever let yourself use your condition as an excuse. For example when you step back and look at yourself do not allow your say "Well, I didn't do "so and so" very well, but that's okay because I have asperger's". Doing so would be just shortchanging yourself and taking the easy way out. Having asperger's is not an excuse to be less successful or less happy that someone without it. It just means that you have to work a little harder (which I'm sure you realize by now) But hey, life's not fair. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you are doing well for yourself, keep it up.|`|b46BnmmIaa	You have certainly made good progress.  Low self-esteem is common among people with these kinds of disorders.  Heck, the problems we experience in the average day can really beat us up mentally and emotionally.<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged by the other Aspies you meet...they are individuals just like everyone else.  Each person with AS is different.<br>  <br>  Keep up the efforts and progress.  Your AS will never totally go away, but you will become better and better at working around it.|`|WjRqYf6naa	It sounds like you are doing quite well for yourself. I congratulate you. My neighbor two doors down is so crippled by Asperger's that he only leaves his apartment to shop for groceries about three times a month.<br>  <br>  It is good that you keep up your hygiene. Bad hygiene is often a sign of depression. You are not a loser. You are a courageous young man and I would be proud to have you as a friend.

Life is not all smooth; we keep on running up against all sorts of problems that we cannot solve, still get sick,  still have accidents and know that one day we shall die. It is impossible to live with all this and stay sane, so our mind finds it better to have a belief to give us hope.   <br>  <br>  You make a bargain with god that if you do right, then you will go to heaven.  Of course no one tells you that this makes ruling much easier for those in charge as not only the state but god will punish or reward you. <br>  <br>  Religion also provides a feeling of companionship and bonding as those in a religious group feel an affinity with the others.|`|urQQ6kbcaa	They can't sort it out for themselves

Portuguese, like from Portugal? The little country beside Spain? In Europe? Ever heard of it? looool<br>  <br>  there are only a few changes from Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese. Like the use of 'Tu' instead of 'Vo?ê', and a few changes in the sentence order. nothing too much.<br>  like american people can perfectly understand british people.<br>  A little dificult because of the accent, but nothing more.<br>  you can go on youtube and watch some videos in brasilian and in portuguese, you'll see that the diference it's not that big.<br>  <br>  And like I said, Portugal is beside Spain, so the languages are somewhat similar, much more diferent than E. and B. Portuguese, but you still can get it. =)<br>  <br>  Oh! some places in Africa also speak portuguese. A little diferent, kind of the same diference from Brazil and Portugal. You know that Portugal was a very curious nation, and discovered a lot of places. so we kind of teached portuguese to a lot of people in a lot of places.<br>  <br>  So, that's why you can understand both languages and a little of spanish.|`|P0gIKAVJaa	Hey - its looks like you can speak fluent Brazilian English too!<br>  <br>  This should tell you something... like Portuguese is Portuguese no matter where you are in the world - just like English is English and Spanish is Spanish - there may be some regional use of words that may be different but thats about all.<br>  <br>  Just because microsoft offer choices like US English, New Zealand English etc doesnt mean the two wont understand each other... its still English albeit with slightly different spelling and maybe some different words in use.<br>  <br>  So, you would not only "sort of" be able to understand European Portuguese (as you put it) - you would be able to perfectly understand it (with a small amount of variation in the use of some words)...<br>  <br>  Brazil does not stand out as having its own language - sorry bubs.

The Father and the Son are the Godhead or Family that the human family is modeled after and are One in the Holy Spirit as The Son is the offspring of the Father. So sorta yeah...but they are God...not god(s). No one has seen the Father except the Son by whom all things were made through Him, by Him and for Him. It is by Him that we live, move and have our being. So the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is the same God of the Old Testament which is manifest in Jesus Christ as our Savior...or Emmanuel "God with us.." See? Begotten is not the same as creating. I didn't create my kids...they wer begotten by me and their father as a human family. Jesus is God because His Father is God. Only God is immortal.|`|Cgz1n3xNaa	Yeah and God would probably make his clone do all of his work cause he's a slacker.

But these are "partitions" of God - not separate beings.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO, you have described a way way way lesser situation than the actual fact of the Trinity in which <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum039.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/...</a><br>  From the Summa Theologica<br>  <br>  The image of a thing may be found in something in two ways. In one way it is found in something of the same specific nature; as the image of the king is found in his son. In another way it is found in something of a different nature, as the king's image on the coin. In the first sense the Son is the Image of the Father; in the second sense man is called the image of God; and therefore in order to express the imperfect character of the divine image in man, man is not simply called the image, but "to the image," whereby is expressed a certain movement of tendency to perfection. But it cannot be said that the Son of God is "to the image," because He is the perfect Image of the Father.

UmjJmYsjaa	About Fullfiling bible prophesies.<br>  <br>  Jesus fullfilled more than 300 of them. Most of them he couldnt manipulate himself.<br>  <br>  THe book of Daniel talks about the Messiah coming and the time he would arrive. It starts counting from the 'word to restore Jerusalem'. Jerusalem was destroyed after the Conquest of Babylon and was left desolate. When the Medo-Persian Army conquered Babylon under Cyrus or Darius was went the Jews were freed. Until Artaxerxes was the word finally the 'word to restore Jerusalem was given.<br>  <br>  Daniel 9:25,26 -""Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree [f] to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, [the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. 26 After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing.<br>  <br>  The Jews wanted a Divine Intervention and a Human Ruler like King David. IF you read the Gospels, i forgot where exactly you'll see that some wanted to make him King.<br>  <br>  I could explain exactly only using the Bible and only the OT or TaNaKh. The bible time prophesy are in there.<br>  <br>  But, the question is. If Jesus Christ was rejected then, do you think the Jewish people would accept him now? NO. What exactly are they looking for? How would he come? <br>  <br>  Trust me when i say. They'll reject him again. Then there'll be Neo Jewish that Dont accept the New Jesus or Old Jesus, but will not accept neither.<br>  <br>  The fact is that, Jesus did Come, and you could see that it has grown to the amount it did. No new religion has spurred up out of nowhere. All the religions are extreamly old and why would some Jews just make up somebody during the Roman Period, when people are smarter. THe apostles preached about Jesus and so it grew by the reputation that was ACTUALLY flowing around that time. The Christian Congregation grew because it was true.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Because he filled none of the prophecies and was clearly not the messiah.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	We can be sure that that wasn't the reason.  <br>  <br>  Absolutely sure because we have this reported in Acts<br>  <br>  34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time. 35 And he said to them, “Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men. 36 “For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. 37 “After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered. 38 “So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will be overthrown; 39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.”|`|NznqjqtPaa	Put simply the Jewish understanding of what the Messiah will be is ver different to what Christians believe.  The Jewish people are awaiting an actual king who will reign on earth and bring peace to all nations.  Jesus didn't do this so they reject him.   It simply comes down to a different interpretation of Old Testament (Tanakh) prophesies.|`|8I9uduIiaa	They were Jews, not Hebrews. They didn't believe Jesus for the same reason we don't today: he was one of MANY young preachers claiming to be the maschiach, and he failed to fulfill our 23 messianic prophecies. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Because there heart were full of pride. and they chose evil over good. like many in our world do today .

M7ZU8VQfaa	We ask who created god because you INSIST that the universe needed a creator!!!  It makes plenty of sense, it is the universe, no one needs to make it since it is the universe.  The source of all is the Universe and it makes perfect sense.  The universe is the universe, there is no need for it to be created since it is whatit is.  Am I right?<br>  <br>  See what I did there.  I just took what you wrote and substituted the word universe for the word god.  If you insist that I accept your reasoning for god not to need a creator based on what you wrote, than I insist that YOU accept that the universe not need a creator based on the exact same argument.|`|wwdllMzYaa	not really<br>  if acording to beleivers everythign that exists has to have a creator<br>  then so does god, as he does exist and as he is part of eveyrthing|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Its easy to make claims when you don't feel they need to be backed by any real evidence.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	We only ask that when creationists and theists say that the universe must have had a creator because things don't come into existence without one. If that is true, then god would also have needed a creator. If you then say that everything except god needs a creator, then there is no reason to say that anything needs a creator. See the point now?|`|HSaVBaiaaa	It also makes perfect sense that matter is and always was here. Just like your lousy god.

It is an irrational question to anyone who has considered Aquinas' Cosmological argument. It is only when we consider whether or not a creator of the universe is a logical necessity that the atheist submissions that universe didn't need a creator become irrational.<br>     The question is posed like this; "It seems that everything witness-able in the universe is contingent in nature. That is it derives it's existence from some previously existing source. So the question inevitably arises; How does a universe consisting of nothing but contingent things come to exist at all?<br>     It is only after considering the witness-able contingency of the universe that the atheist answer that the universe always existed becomes insufficient. <br>    God is the answer to the contingency question if he indeed always was, is and shall be, an eternal being that always existed outside of time. It is a non-contingent answer to a contingent universe.|`|C42YeDPuaa	Then stop insisting that the universe HAS to have a creator.<br>  <br>  The universe is the creator of all so it makes perfect sense that the universe doesn't need a creator.<br>  <br>  You can't insist with one breath that everything has to have a creator, then with the next breath grant your god an exemption.|`|htQrkD8waa	"Why do people ask who created Galactus?<br>  It makes plenty of sense he is Galactus.

JY0Ix1rPaa	aww don't be nervous it will all come naturally once you get going. I wouldn't say that girls like to be kissed differently each person has there own personal preference. <br>  <br>  I like when kisses are soft light and with out a lot of tongue. My ex-bf absolutely disgusted me by shoving his tongue down my throat not to mention he had gross facial hair that did not feel good against my face uhggg. <br>  <br>  My current girlfriend is an amazing kisser and I'm the first person she's been with and so its been a great experience with her things get more comfortable the more we do it. She was super nervous at first but you just have to trust yourself and be in tuned to your partner and dont hesitate to ask questions. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|yFo1GR3gaa	Thats cute, I'm sure she's thrilled.

5hD0alFyaa	Kindred spirit or soul mate. Heterosexually speaking of course. They had a common bond that could not be broken, their love for the Lord, God of Israel. There was love and great admiration between them. Jonathan knew of David's anointing as the next King of Israel and that knowledge did not come between them, even though Jonathan stood to gain the throne if his father had not messed up.

NiOlegDyaa	Well, this is a very good point you bring up. While it has caused many tragedies and massacres over many centuries, I think that you're looking at it the wrong way. It is not religion that is the root of all evil, it is the people who misuse it for there own desires. Take the terrorists for example. The leaders of the terrorist groups take advantage of desperate people via religion.<br>  I have a religion and I find that it centers me.|`|AA10478297	the world would be a better place without religions|`|AA11336384	I do not think religion is necessarily evil, if you don't take it in extreme context. Even though I am debating religion within myself, I believe if you take only the good things that religion has given, then it isn't harmful. Then again, good aspects of religion are really moral things everyone should practice, regardless of religion (help thy brother [except the conservatives who don't want to], treat people with repsect [...if you're the same religion, but that's something I'd rather it to apply to the human race], etc.)<br>  <br>  For the truth part (such as creationism), it only hinders a person's knowledge, which is harmful.<br>  <br>  Terrorism is due to extreme religious thoughts, and it happens in all religions, not just Islam. (It's just the only thing you see on the news.) Terroristic actions exist in small parts of Islam. Not every Palestinian agrees with the Hamas. Same with Jews and how they should have all of Israel.Some religious people are quite nice, and won't care what your beliefs are.|`|r6JskEtxaa	unnecessary|`|fzih25msaa	I think religion is dangerous.

EQhY4x05aa	Their trying to start arguments?  I do that all the time, it really has more to do with your personality then with your religious beliefs.|`|AA12095483	Of course not. But you can. Ignore that behavior, and set a better example. Parents CAN learn from their children - if they are willing. If not, recognize that the parent in question has other problems and reasons for their behavior.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	No that is not Christian. However, you must honour your father and mother. You will be out on your own soon enough.<br>  <br>  P.S. You will likely be surprised at how much you are are like your parents when you are an adult. They programmed you for many years to be like them. That's where being born again comes into play.|`|RermzbWgaa	Honor them.<br>  <br>  If your parent is really attempting to unjustly bring you harm, then it is likely something apart from you that is motivating that behavior (IE. they have "issues").  The Lord commands we honor our parents however....sometimes his commands are difficult to obey...but He commands it nonetheless.<br>  <br>  Maybe tell them that you are trying to honor them, and that you seek mercy, forgiveness, and understanding.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	as parents go!<br>  <br>  children are to submit to their parents. <br>  but parents are NOT to proke children to anger. <br>  <br>  almost every person goes through phases. some learn by wisdom, others have to be chastened by the lord. <br>  as a third party observer, i think you should bring a 2nd witness or a 3rd and approach your parent. if it is not you they are bringing "down". <br>  if it is YOU. maybe one needs to look in your own eye for the beam. <br>  <br>  if its not you bring this to the attention of the church elders and Pray alot.|`|JxUFDutxaa	No..that parent isn't following Jesus.<br>  Even though parents aren't perfect and will make mistakes..<br>  To purposely demean or hurt someone is not the Christian way.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Pray for the parent.|`|AA11389157	Does this parent claim to be a Christian? And how old is the child that would "correct" this parent? You didn't say.<br>  <br>  IF this parent claims to be a Christian, I would just say, respectfuly, "I don't think it makes the Lord happy when you do that. I'm relying on you to set a good example for me."|`|kdo6qnS9aa	That depends upon what lind of "ruffling" your referring to. If that parent is ruffling the feathers of those who are living and acting outside the will of God, then they are being good parents following Jesus' teachings.|`|naI5hGjHaa	Regardless of whether or not that parent is trying to follow Jesus, I think that parent needs some help figuring out who he or she is, and what their purpose is.|`|cXXJVz64aa	I've met many people like that, claiming to be christians. Many old women like to gossip in church & on the phone about others, changing the truth to improve their stories.|`|lEPGcFqFaa	No, there is nothing like Christ in this conduct.  Always answer sweetly like, "Thank you so much, that helps my ego" or something similar.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	No , you should approach situations and people with kindness always. Even Jesus didn't MAKE  anyone follow him.|`|8w3gC9RUaa	Obey your parents Exodus 20:12 but always pray for G-d to soften their heart.  Tell them how you feel.|`|DFwnW5kFaa	Ephesians 6,1-7<br>  This is a good start for parents and children. If your parent(s) are acceptable then read this with them. Vs 4 is a reminder for parents not to be 'downing' their kids. There are so many more but i hope this helps you and the situaton.|`|iLC0KfP8aa	They wouldn't be following Jesus very closely if at all.<br>  <br>  "Do you think that parent is following Jesus?" <br>  <br>  No.|`|23a40057173c5d574883c830636c51ffaa	At that moment no.

From those reasons the “Green telephone lines” have been presented to the local media for free which the local organisations have given excellent cooperation.

d1226c2980a2b991f5c5e9b71b6f4359aa	Pat Robertson said about ALL other religions, "No.  They don’t have a relationship.  There is the god of the Bible, who is Jehovah.  When you see L-O-R-D in caps, that is the name.  It’s not Allah, it’s not Brahma, it’s not Shiva, it’s not Vishnu, it’s not Buddha.  It is Jehovah God.  They don’t have a relationship with him.  He is the God of all Gods.  These others are mostly demonic powers. Sure they’re demons.  There are many demons in the world." If Pat is mixing in Government is he also doing a demonic thing too if we read Matthew 4:8-10 right? Jesus had a good godly reason to say no to the one wanting to give him ALL the human kingdoms of the world because he would have had to give up worship of Jehovah to worship the Devil. So if Pat does not hallow Jehovah's name daily on his TV religious show is he not too doing the Devil's will since Jesus said hallow the Father's name Jehovah? Jesus is the Son but he did not say hallow the Son's name ONLY the Father's name! At John 17:3 Jesus said, "This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ." Showing ONLY TWO people to take in knowledge of above ALL else! Not three just two! The three idea came from the Pagan world outside the Bible but the paid clergy twist things to fool people into believing that teaching is from the Bible. In time the clergy will pay for their lies!<br>   <br>  Like said by, Americans United for Separation of Church and State "The cast of characters has changed, but the script is still the same," said Lynn. "Pat Robertson is still driving for a controlling voice in the Republican Party and the U.S. government. If he succeeds, this play could have a tragic ending."

IVy35SE2aa	That is part of growing up and learning social skills.  As a sophomore<br>  you are too young to be looking for a life partner.

Having a crush on a guy leaving in 3 months<br>  looks to me like a way of avoiding having to meet and date guys.<br>  It sounds like you are living in a dream world and avoiding the real<br>  world.  <br>  You probably won't find a knight in shining armour right away, and<br>  as they say, you will probably have to kiss a few toads before<br>  you find the frog that turns into a prince.

EsptpSYHaa	As a fluent speaker, I can say that Japanese is not as difficult to learn as you'd think.  The pronunciation is fairly straightforward.  Grammatically, everything follows the same rules, so you don't have to memorize eight or nine different conjugations as you would with Spanish or German.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the writing, there are three sets of characters, two of which are identical in pronunciation and can both be learned simply in a couple of weeks.  You'll pick up the Chinese characters (Kanji) as time goes on, with the help of a little practice and a good dictionary.<br>  <br>  The hardest things to learn are probably slang terms or different dialects, but overall, standard Japanese is technically a very simple language.  My best advice would be to just give it a shot and not be intimidated.  If you can master something like German, I think you'll be surprised at how quickly you'll pick up Japanese.|`|f0I1f6Y5aa	Compared to the Romance languages and company, Japanese--like all other Asian languages--have no connections to anything Westerners do grammatically except for borrowed words.<br>  <br>  If I'm correct, translation from Japanese to English/whatever is often broken because of the different syntax. They have simple words that are emphasized by other words to distinguish time place etc. But it's way~ different.<br>  <br>  Our: That boy is running in front of a car!<br>  <br>  Could be their: Boy running front of car!<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure, honestly. xD|`|gRG6iGZoaa	I took Japanese for three years in school.  I found it to be difficult, but as long as you're up for a challenge then you shouldn't have a problem.<br>  <br>  As stated, it is unlike any other language (minus other Asian languages) but I don't regret learning it.|`|0093ec8ace66f00d94d7fb1fcb4edb3aaa	go to " byki " it is a free learning system for languages. all languages are difficult to start with.but most languages have 1000 common words used in all languages.like up down etc.more people are learning japanese as it is easiest eastern language to learn.I speak german.dutch.greek.russian.and a little japanese.Oh ! and of course English.|`|92EBhWdtaa	Japanese is totally different from English Spanish or German.

W5VqTPQRaa	When trying to learn a culture, the more time is always better.  However, it largely depends on how much you really want to immerse yourself.  Argentina has a complex culture, but the people are very warm and receptive, so you shouldn't have a problem.  Also, you may think that you know spanish now, but wait until you get down here.  I thought i knew spanish too, but the people here speak a different dialect and very very fast, so it is difficult.  It might take you a few months to get used to it.

Also, study with friends. Divide up the material to cover. You will remember things based on who made which presentation.

Some people think that because the ancient Mayan calender cycle ends on that date, the world will end.  Actually, it's just like the end of a cycle and it will start over again, like a new year or new decade.

Often Doomsday prophecies are very scary, but the Mayan calendar only stops on that day. The Mayan's never predicted that this would be the end-of-the-world, but the beginning of a new age! Many more predictions about specific dates of the end of times, have been made in the past which have never come true. The predictions of end times appear to increase in certain time periods. After the crucifixion of Jesus Christ the apostles started predicting that the end was near way back then.<br>  <br>  During world wars 1&2, the Korean war, and Vietnam war, there were also many predictions of the end times. The media and television programs about 12/21/2012 are only trying to cash in on all of the hype and make a quick profit with 12/21/2012 fast approaching. It is true that mankind is obviously on the edge of another great change, with the recent economic crisis looming, global climate changes occurring, the speed of Internet communication ever increasing. Religious and moral differences world-wide are causing conflicting belief systems about the planets future. The doom and gloom prophecies about December 12, 2012; may or may not have any basis in fact or reality at all!<br>  <br>  Do you remember the Y2K frenzy? There is however one interesting astronomical phenomenon that will happen on 12/21/2012 when the sun rises on that day, as seen from Central America, it will be in the direction of Sagittarius in the exact center of the galaxy. While the Mayans deserve credit for figuring this out, as well as all the rest of their marvelous astronomy, none of this means their mythology is reality based. In fact they couldn't even predict their own future of what tomorrow might bring!<br>  <br>  <br>  Please check out source as under:|`|SzybqjFxaa	Depends on your personal taste.  To me, it's a little TOO convenient for the world to just happen to end at the end of the last month in the year.|`|JI1chuBQaa	The only thing that's going to happen on 12 21 2012 is that the Mayan are going to need another Calendar for the next Baktun Cycle.

Eventually, you won't hear as much from them. They are very busy on the other side aspiring; waiting for you.|`|NOTc1b9saa	Yes, absolutely, for we are all spiritual beings, temporarily within our physical overcoat whilst we manifest on Earth, but after we die, we continue living in the world of Spirit, or Heaven, and are basically the same person five minutes before we die as we are five minutes after, the same memories, the same beliefs, the same loves and the same hates!..As happens here on Earth, we learn slowly as and when we choose to do so..There is no sudden revelation of the truth there or here..<br>  <br>  It is often the case that when they first pass over, especially if they did not have knowledge of the life hereafter, they endeavour to appear to us when we are most relaxed, often at night and, as others have said, sometimes in *dreams* to show us they still live and still love us..<br>  <br>  Ive been aware of the Spirit world for a long time and have had some wonderful and moving experiences..It is not wrong to have a natural interest in such things, especially when we lose a loved one..Some people have special *gifts* to be able to sense, see or hear those from Spirit, although we all are psychic to some degree and it depends on how sensitive we are as to how aware of such things we might be..<br>  <br>  How great to have three other positive responses and, as yet, no religious condemnations on our using the inner senses that God gave us!|`|dFBccLExaa	Yup.

mVTGl6HGaa	Tisquantum (better known as Squanto) (c. 1580s – November 1622) was one of two Native American Indians (Samoset being the other) that assisted the Pilgrims after their first winter in the New World. He was a member of the Patuxet tribe, a subtribe of the Wampanoag Confederacy.<br>  <br>  [edit] Biography<br>  <br>  George Weymouth was an English captain who explored the area now known as the state of Maine. During the course of the exploration in 1605, he and his men captured some indigenous people to show to his sponsor, as evidence of his exploratory work. The names of the natives were: Manida, Skidwarres/Skettawarroes, Nahanada/Dehanada, Assacumet and Tisquantum. They were turned over to Weymouth's superior, Sir Ferdinando Gorges. It is then thought that Tisquantum was trained in English to be a translator in New England. He returned to North America in 1612 with Captain John Smith, who after some service time released him to walk home to his village.<br>  <br>  On his way back to his tribe in 1614, Tisquantum was kidnapped by another Englishman, Thomas Hunt. Hunt was one of John Smith's lieutenants. Hunt was planning to sell fish, corn, and captured slaves in Málaga, Spain. Hunt attempted to sell Tisquantum and a number of other Native Americans into slavery for ￡20 apiece.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Sir Ferdinando Gorges, in A Brief Relation of the Discovery and Plantation of New England (London, 1622) wrote that some local friars, however, discovered what Hunt was attempting and took the remaining Indians, Tisquantum included, in order to instruct them in the Christian faith. Eventually, Tisquantum escaped to London, living with a John Slany for a few years, and then went to Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland. Attempting to avoid the walk from Newfoundland to his home village, Tisquantum tried to take part in an expedition to that part of the North American east coast. He returned to England in 1618, however, when that plan fell through.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  He returned once more to his homeland in 1619, making his way with an exploratory expedition along the New England coast. He was soon to discover that his tribe, the Patuxet, as well as a majority of coastal New England tribes (mostly Wampanoag and Massachusett), had been decimated the year before by a plague, possibly smallpox.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Tisquantum finally settled with the Pilgrims at the site of his former village and helped them recover from their first difficult winter by teaching them to increase their food production by fertilizing their crops, and by directing them to the best places to catch fish and eels.<br>  <br>  Whatever Tisquantum's motives, he ended up distrusted by both the English and the Native people. Massasoit, the sachem who originally appointed Tisquantum a diplomat to the Pilgrims, did not trust him before the tribe's dealing with the pilgrims (as is evidenced by the assignment of Hobamok, whose name may also have been a pseudonym as it referred to "mischievous," to watch over Tisquantum and act as a second representative), and certainly not after.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  On his way back from a meeting to repair the damaged relations between the Natives and the Pilgrims, Tisquantum became sick with a fever; however, it is speculated that he had been poisoned because of his disloyalty to the sachem.[1] He died a few days later in 1622 in Chatham, Massachusetts, and is now buried in an unmarked grave on Burial Hill in Chathamport, overlooking Ryder's Cove. But his legacy remained relatively untarnished as peace between the two groups lasted for another fifty years.[citation needed]
KwUhbxY8aa	The Torah was given to the Jewish people in the year 2448 since the beginning of creation. By your calculation the year would be 1313 BCE. <br>  <br>  The real Author of the Torah is none other than G-d Himself. And although He may not have physically written (with "His hand" so to speak) it was taught completely to Moses who wrote down every single word spoken to him while he was on Mount Sinai for 40 days and 40 nights. <br>  <br>  It was at Mount Sinai that the Torah was then given to the Jewish people - together with the 7 laws of Noach which were given to the non-Jewish world which they would be required to follow from that point onwards.<br>  <br>  Moses wrote down what is known as the "5 Books of Moses" or commonly called the Bible. It is true that within the entire Canon of the Written Law known as Tanach (for Torah, Neviim and Ketuvim, or Torah, Prophets and Writings,) there are 24 books in total. 19 additional books over and above the main 5 books as above. These were written by various prophets and leaders of the generations then (see sources below for more information) and compiled by the Men of the Great Assembly in about the year 450 BCE. This is not a confirmed exact date however and it is possible that the canonisation took place later.<br>  <br>  There is also the oral part of the Torah. This of course has been given over throughout the generations up until today - since that day at Mount Sinai over 3320 years ago. While it was never written down formally, the most classic text known as the Talmud is in truth the essence of the entire oral Torah. Thousands of books have since been written, and thousands are written daily describing and clarifying more and more what the Talmud teaches - although the original source is exactly the same with absolutely no disputes about it from any orthodox and authentic Torah Rabbi.<br>  <br>  See sources for more information. All are authentic Torah and authentic Judaism - the only places to look when searching for authentic answers about Torah and Judaism|`|NCRfZRopaa	There is no single person who wrote the Bible as it has many authors. It was most likely put together during the Diaspora in BabylonIan empire.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for the "religious" answer, you can always fall on the non-scholarly answer, Moses.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Ezra didn't write the whole thing but he put it together in Babylon.|`|AA10556726	No one.  The books that eventually became the torah were not written until around 600 BCE and then many of them where stiched together from various other sources.

I am 3 years older than my man and we've been together for 10 years.  It depends on if he's someone you are interested in.  I would probably not like it that his dad was my preacher, but, it wouldn't be too bad.  The worst that could happen is you could part on bad terms and you may feel uncomfortable at church.  But, it could work out great.  Where better to find a guy than in church?|`|4MLtp9g1aa	My wife is 5 years older than me, and we have been married 35 years.

In fact, I daresay the Christian church supported many things that we today see as atrocious.  Puritans supported masecuring demonic indians.  The Deist movement that arose in America sought to treat everything with respect and fought against the negative image given to the indians.|`|OlLMoT5Daa	Humanism - or have you failed to note the changes in how people have been treated in the past 200 years?<br>  <br>  If a lot of churches still had their way, slavery would still exist, ethnic minorities would not be considered human, women would have no voice and be allowed to be beaten. Children could be abused without anyone saying anything about it.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Christianity.  God is the only benefit to man.

Check out the life forms that exist at the bottom of the ocean around thermo vents, for examples.  <br>  <br>  Finally, you're talking about a massive sudden evolutionary shift rather than the scientifically accepted mechanism of gradual branching and progression of species.  You need to remember that the earth is very old, and that changes in life forms likely shifted gradually.  If you wish to trace this sort of gradual change, but at a pace which is more easy to comprehend, please look at viral DNA.  Please see the evolution of the AIDS virus over the course of the past ten years.  On an admittedly different model and slightly longer scale, please trace the evolution of human language as human kind spreads.  Look, for example, at the differentiation between Irish and Scottish Gaelic.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to discuss a topic, you might wish to study at least the commonly accepted basics and mechanisms of the subject before passing judgment or posting criticisms of it.|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	> "Was the first single cell organism an animal or plant?"<br>  <br>  Neither - it would have been a bacterium.<br>  <br>  > "If it was an animal what did it eat?

It would need to bio-originate with a fully functioning photosynthesis capability."<br>  <br>  Since your original suggestion is wrong, this is meaningless. BUT:<br>  most single-celled organisms can obtain their energy from multiple sources, such as both photosynthesis and "eating" food.<br>  The original life-form would most likely have been chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic (getting its energy from non-organic chemicals or from heat) - both of which still exist today as energy sources for autotrophic bacteria.<br>  <br>  > "And then suddenly at some point, a plant mutates and stops consuming carbon dioxide and begins to burn oxigen and feed on plants. Or suddenly a plant gives birth to an animal."<br>  <br>  Since plants and animals (and bacteria, and archaebacteria, and fungi) all evolved at the same time as each other, your statement shows a staggering lack-of-knowledge about evolution. Well done!<br>  <br>  > "A plant giving birth to an animal."<br>  <br>  Here's one for you: corals (animals) live by photosynthesis.<br>  Here's another: the dodder (a plant) has no chlorophyll, and cannot perform photosynthesis.<br>  Euglena (a single-celled organism) performs both photosynthesis and food-consumption.<br>  <br>  See?

AA10034051	It should be important to all Christians, not just Catholic Christians.<br>  <br>  Lent, in the Christian Church is the forty-day-long liturgical season of fasting and prayer before Easter. The forty days represent the time Jesus spent in the desert, where according to the Bible he endured temptation by Satan.<br>  <br>  The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer—through prayer, penitence, almsgiving and self-denial—for the annual commemoration during Holy Week of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the events linked to the Passion of Christ and culminates in Easter, the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Is Lent biblical? Well lets see what the bible says<br>  <br>  our Lord observed Lent for 40days. <br>  <br>  Moses observed Lent for 40 days and received the commandments from LORD. (Exodus 34:28). <br>  <br>  Elisha observed lent for 40 days and taken to heaven. (1 Kings 19:8).. <br>  <br>  The people of Nineve observed lent for 3 days and were saved from the wrath of God. ( Jonah 3:6). <br>  <br>  Esther describes in chapter 4, that during the time of Ahasuerus, that all Jews observed lent for 3 days and were saved from the death. <br>  <br>  Prophet Daniel observed lent by praying and fasting for the Jewish people (Daniel 9:3-21) <br>  <br>  Ezra received blessing from God when she observed Lent. (Ezra 8:23) <br>  <br>  Nehemiah observed lent and received blessing from God (Nehemiah 1:4) <br>  <br>  “Proclaim a fast, call an assembly; Gather the elders, all who dwell in the land , Into the house of the LORD, your God and cry to the LORD. <br>  <br>  In all these versus our Patriarch’s and our LORD observed the Lent. Though the number of days varied, in all these cases, God favored and blessed the people who observed the Lent.<br>  <br>  <br>  She [Anna] never left the temple, but worshipped night and day with fasting and prayer” (Luke 2:37) <br>  <br>  Matthew 4th chapter describes our Lord’s observance of lent for 40days and His win over Satan. <br>  <br>  Our Lord commands how to observe Lent in Matthew 6:16 . “When you fast do not look gloomy like hypocrites……… But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to be fasting, except to your Father who see what is hidden will repay you” <br>  <br>  Our Lord teaches that the church should observe Lent till He come back. “The days will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast” (Matthew 9:15) <br>  <br>  Acts 13:2 says that the Christians at Antioch has been fasting and worshiping the Lord. <br>  <br>  “The completing their fasting and prayer, they laid hands on them and sent them off” (Acts 13:3)|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Yes, it is open to all who wish to participate.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Lent is a catholic tradition<br>  <br>  But feel free to give something up if it makes you feel good.<br>  <br>  <br>  I gave up Catholicsism for lent, 30 years ago.  But I love the Lord!|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	Lent is a liturgical season and I don't know if your denomination recognizes it or not and the best person to ask is your pastor.<br>  <br>  It's a beautiful thing to give something up for our Lord and God.  You don't have to be Catholic to give something up in the weeks before Easter for our Lord.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	It is what the catholic religion does, but it wouldn't hurt to give something up for Him anyway, anytime!!  :)|`|7mhRDbvsaa	till this day i still don't know what lent is|`|9apjRRsRaa	Let this verse set you free in your pursuit of God:<br>  <br>  Rom 14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you there is any ritual that will get you closer to God. We do communion "in remembrance" of Him. We are baptized to be "buried with" Him. There are more, but the focus is Him, not the act. If God leads you to lent, so be it. If not so be it. Go through with whatever He says. Just know that formality will bring about death, but the Spirit gives life, and life abundantly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, my friend.|`|8cE7LFPDaa	you should choose.  Jesus spent 40 days in the desert being tempted by satan.  thus catholics give up something they enjoy.  if you choose to give up something be honest about it.

AyEkA6Flaa	Let me re-phrase what your son and his friends said.<br>  <br>  "It's the anatomy that counts, because it is the embodiment of maleness".<br>  <br>  There is a certain power, vibration, aura (not sure how to say this) of "male" that is just incredibly attractive to a gay guy.<br>  <br>  That maleness is embodied, of course.<br>  <br>  It's interesting, I have at times found myself wildly attracted by a cute young man only to walk up to him and find out that "he" was actually a "she".  The instant I realized that, my interest level plummeted to zero!  Obviously there is the physical element that she lacked male anatomy, but -- she just wasn't a guy, hence not what I was hoping for at all.<br>  <br>  Feminine acting men annoy me a little bit personally, but honestly, even if they seem to act a bit femmy, they are still male and still have both that anatomy and that aura.<br>  <br>  A lesbian with short hair is still definitely a woman.  And a gay guy with long hair or eyeliner is still definitely a man.  I'm not sure I can fully explain it, but that's the way it is.|`|qTRzRi8gaa	No, of course not.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way, unless someone is asexual, meaning *if they are sexual*, then yes, sex matters to them.<br>  <br>  That's not in any way to say that it's the only thing.  Not even close.<br>  <br>  But it is an important part.  Imagine a sexless relationship.  Would that be fun for most people?<br>  <br>  Males in general tend to be *quite* sexual, gay or straight.  The only difference is they find the male form appealing rather than the female form...|`|420d72e7d945fb5cb4d470808614f009aa	Of course, I can't speak for every gay man, but for myself, I do not wish to date someone I would not eventually want for a long-term partner.  This means I will date men exclusively.  I like the male physique, the flat chest, the body hair, to a certain extent, and this is what attracts me sexually, and romantically.<br>  Whether that man acts feminine or masculine is secondary, as long as he has a personality that pleases me.|`|nuCXcLUIaa	They're saying that it's the 'technical gender' that counts, not how they may or may not act.  For instance, if I were to see a guy that I thought was really cute then found out he was actually a she, I wouldn't be sexually attracted to her at all.  Aside from that, it's not all about sex, but usually to fall in love with someone, you have to be physically attracted to them, and in the case of being gay... anatomy counts.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	Not necessarily. Most women aren't even that feminine to begin with. But being gay is being able to love another man. Sure, it may not be love for now, but the strong attraction is there. It's kind of like a male instinct when people say gay men are promiscuous, but so are straight men when it comes to liking sex. Your gay son will always be a "man", because he is.<br>  <br>  :)|`|Wplt9tuNaa	Ask the same question of straights; why date a female when there's feminine guys? It's still the "anatomy that counts", and apparently *those* relationships aren't *just* for sex...|`|8OXVSoe0aa	No. it's...complicated. But there is a difference between feminine acting men and women. And the same could be said for straight people. Why wouldn't you date a masculine girl?|`|AMa9czcBaa	Its the reason why you married your husband. Would you have married him if let's say he was exactly the same minus the penis? I highly doubt it.<br>  <br>  No matter how femme a guy can look he will never be a girl. Sex is a big part of life and how you choose your partner to accompany you on this journey and life in general is also important. <br>  <br>  I think though that your question has some underlying factors to it, which you might or may not have discovered yet, such as the fact that you are still praying your son might not be gay.|`|fdMKpXCHaa	The anatomy is the attraction.  It's not the only attraction, but the lack of said anatomy is a deal breaker.  Like some guys only like blondes.  If you're not a blonde, you don't have a chance.|`|4Te5gVvDaa	It is not only about the anatomy. Yes there are some initial biological impulses that they base there sexual predilections off of but many gay men also are seeking a fruitful relationship. Homosexuality is not a trait of inherent perversion. People are attracted to certain traits. They probably were not able to convey their real intentions or did not expect you to scrutinize their every word.

mVTGl6HGaa	In 1851, the United States Congress passed the Indian Appropriations Act which authorized the creation of Indian reservations in modern day Oklahoma. Relations between settlers and natives had grown increasingly worse as the settlers encroached on territory and natural resources in the West.<br>  <br>  President Ulysses S. Grant pursued a stated "Peace Policy" as a possible solution to the conflict. The policy included a reorganization of the Indian Service, with the goal of relocating various tribes from their ancestral homes to parcels of lands established specifically for their inhabitation. The policy called for the replacement of government officials by religious men, nominated by churches, to oversee the Indian agencies on reservations in order to teach Christianity to the native tribes. The Quakers were especially active in this policy on reservations. The "civilization" policy was aimed at eventually preparing the tribes for citizenship.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Reservation treaties sometimes included stipend agreements, in which the federal government would grant a certain amount of goods to a tribe yearly. The implementation of the policy was erratic, however, and in many cases the stipend goods were not delivered.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  [edit] Controversy<br>  <br>  The policy was controversial from the start. Reservations were generally established by executive order. In many cases, white settlers objected to the size of land parcels, which were subsequently reduced. A report submitted to Congress in 1868 found widespread corruption among the federal Native American agencies and generally poor conditions among the relocated tribes.<br>  <br>  Many tribes ignored the relocation orders at first and were forced onto their new limited land parcels. Enforcement of the policy required the United States Army to restrict the movements of various tribes. The pursuit of tribes in order to force them back onto reservations led to a number of Native American Wars. The most well known conflict was the Sioux War on the northern Great Plains, between 1876 and 1881, which included the Battle of Little Bighorn. Other famous wars in this regard included the Nez Perce War.<br>  <br>  By the late 1870s, the policy established by President Grant was regarded as a failure, primarily because it had resulted in some of the bloodiest wars between Native Americans and the United States. By 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes began phasing out the policy, and by 1882 all religious organizations had relinquished their authority to the federal Indian agency.<br>  Most Indian reservations, like the Laguna Indian reservation in New Mexico (pictured 1943), are in the western United States, often in arid regions unsuitable for agriculture.<br>  <br>  In 1887, Congress undertook a significant change in reservation policy by the passage of the Dawes Act, or General Allotment (Severalty) Act. The act ended the general policy of granting land parcels to tribes as-a-whole by granting small parcels of land to individual tribe members. In some cases, for example the Umatilla Indian Reservation, after the individual parcels were granted out of reservation land, the reservation area was reduced by giving the excess land to white settlers. The individual allotment policy continued until 1934, when it was terminated by the Indian Reorganization Act.<br>  <br>  [edit] The Indian New Deal<br>  <br>  The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, also known as the Howard-Wheeler Act, was sometimes called the Indian New Deal. It laid out new rights for Native Americans, reversed some of the earlier privatization of their common holdings, and encouraged self-government and land management by tribes. The act slowed the assignment of tribal lands to individual members, and reduced the assignment of 'extra' holdings to nonmembers.<br>  <br>  For the following twenty years, the U.S. government invested in infrastructure, health care, and education on the reservations, and over two million acres (8,000 km2) of land were returned to various tribes. Within a decade of John Collier's retirement (the initiator of the Indian New Deal) the government's position began to swing in the opposite direction. The new Indian Commissioners Myers and Emmons introduced the idea of the "withdrawal program" or "termination" which sought to end the government's responsibility and involvement with Indians and to force their assimilation. The Indians would lose their lands but be compensated (though those who lost their lands often weren't). Though discontent and social rejection killed the idea before it was fully implemented, five tribes were terminated (Coushattas, Utes, Paiutes, Menominees and Klamaths) and 114 groups in California lost their federal recognition as tribes. Many individuals were also relocated to cities only to have a full third of them return to their tribes in the decades following.

I, too, am a visual learner and for me to retain knowledge I have to read it. I learned to read, speak, and write Spanish almost 10 years ago and it is still easier for me to read it than understand it when it is spoken.  Being surrounded by the language helps a lot.  When I am in South America, it becomes easier each day to understand what is spoken to me.

It isn't a matter of which spirit we carry, but where do we put our values? If we place our values on the things of the world, then we follow the things of the world and turn our back on the things of the spirit. It is all a matter of will -- and the choices we make.<br>  <br>  The spirit we carry is our own. We can let it give in to the pleasures of the body or we can have it control the body's passions. It is all up to us and the choices we make.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Mar 14:38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly [is] ready, but the flesh [is] weak.
pfNnuD5saa	Yes, I love animals. I think humans will pay for harming Gods creation.|`|3T2s2Snuaa	The bible sets many clear examples of why animals are here.  Before Jesus was sacrificed humans killed animals as sacrifices, and for passover, and to eat, Jesus himself told the story about the boy who took his inheritance and blew it, and his father embrased him when he came back home and he had the fattest calf slaughtered.  Eating and killing animals is a necessity to life, I have no problems with it.  However, I despise it when people kill things for the pure sport of it (not including pest) when people do that it shows that they have no respect for life.  I hunt birds and deer, but I always eat whatever I kill.|`|2d30854bec7b4d3aa1bb8af4207bdf4baa	First, to Valerie...the stem cells are there, so wouldn't it be better to use them to save someones life rather than to kill them off? Kind of like the West Nile example you gave. I am Pro Choice, but I am NOT pro abortion. I think that in most cases abortion is not the right one to make, but I don't think the government should have a say in it. That being said, since abortion is legal, why not make something good out of the bad? My cousin's life was saved by a stem cell transplant.<br>  <br>  Now to the real question...I think the we punish ourselves for the 'sins' we commit, not God. If we abuse an animal, we will be punished for it. I think any deliberate abuse or torture is probably done by a dark spirit and they recycle back in to life to present us with lessons and obstacles. I think the intended purpose of many animals is to feed us. As someone else pointed out, Jesus ate meat, so therefore we can conclude that God feels it's okay. I do not believe in hunting for sport, but I also don't think God sees that as a sin.<br>  ~Pearce, my friend~|`|6nExSFMZaa	Im a atheist, so i don't think they will be punished by god.<br>  <br>  And i am 100% against animal cruelty, its pointless and weak.<br>  <br>  Im not sure about god though...look at the bible and nature , he seems to be all for cruelty .|`|5GL2eFhyaa	We have hard enough time taking care of our OWN species|`|Z5ereta1aa	of course!!!!! god created all living things and they all deserve respect!|`|btYjw5wQaa	YES|`|Ac3Z0RLuaa	i believe we should treat all of god's creatures<br>  with the respect that God treats us|`|FXL6xsXAaa	God is a nonexistent entity and we assume too much about the form-- even if there is something of a deity that exists in our comprehensible Universe-- of a God.  It is foolish, simplistic, yet honorable, to believe in a God and a set of morals.  I am Igtheist and I believe this to be entirely true.  I also find it an insult that Yahoo spellchecker recognizes Christianity as a correct spelling, and Igtheist (or igtheism, for that matter) as a mistake.  This is a bias by all means.  Either way, I can't resist giving my two cents.|`|8mLuWhzhaa	Im kinda Christian and there is 10 commandments BTW you can skip to six and ten at the bottom!!! <br>  1.I am the Lord your god.Who brought you to the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

Six days you shall labor, and do all your work; but the seventh day is a Sabbath to The Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your manservant, or your maidservant, or your cattle, or the sojourner who is within your gates; for in six days The Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore The Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."\<br>  5.Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which The Lord your God gives you."<br>  Well thats a few of them but I think these are them<br>  6.You shall not kill<br>  10.You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ***, or anything that is your neighbor's.|`|tdcUUA5Zaa	I'm not sure if they will be punished, but I beleive that God put us on this earth to take care of it, meaning take care of the animals too.

They have no reason to say that they KNOW that there is no God.|`|86PUxs1jaa	1.) I know that there is no God.<br>  <br>  I've been an atheist for most of my life and, as far as I know, there are two types of atheist -- those who "know" it is impossible for God to exist, usually because there is no verifiable evidence (strong atheist), and those who don't personally believe in God because they choose or prefer not to (weak atheist).<br>  <br>  Fence sitters, who refuse to commit themselves to belief or non-belief, because "nobody knows" are generally called agnostics.<br>  <br>  Anybody who does believe, regardless of the quality or lack of evidence, regardless of their personal reasons, is still called a Believer.<br>  <br>  I suspect you've confused yourself because you've used the word "unfavorable," which implies some sort of evidence that God doesn't exist.  ...and there essentially isn't any such thing.  It's always impossible to prove that God doesn't exist because there will always remain an infinity of unexamined possibilities.  Thus, any negative evidence, regardless of how compelling it may seem, is ultimately meaningless.  <br>  <br>  I'm a strong atheist entirely because no believer has ever been able to provide even a shred of verifiable evidence to substantiate the assertion that God actually exists.  I'm certainly not an atheist because I have overwhelmingly conclusive negative evidence, nor because I have a personal superstitious belief that God doesn't exist.  I don't believe mainly because I know for certain objective reality actually is physical and the only evidence Christians ever offer for God's existence are their own subjective mental experiences.  I just cannot ignore the fact my own thoughts are entirely imaginary and cannot be said to actually exist, nor can anything else that is merely a part of my subjective mental experience.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that both Solipsism and Idealism are completely absurd and amount to nothing more than persistent unsubstantiated superstition.|`|2ogimlBxaa	2.<br>  <br>  There's no way to absolutely know.|`|XuO2rTteaa	Number 2 best describes me.<br>  <br>  No, agnostics don't believe in a god. When someone calls themselves a agnostic, they're typically referring to there knowledge. Richard Dawkins even called himself an agnostic on that note.<br>  <br>  If someone believes there is a god, but then says that is unknowable, than that is a contradiction. Typically those people will refer to themselves as general theists, or deists.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	2 because Ra and I get along just fine most days.|`|a9etFur6aa	2. Because the evidence is unfavorable. It's impossible to actually know. Just like I don't know if there are leprachauns, but I'm betting my money there are not because there is 0 evidence. It's the believers job to prove, not the disbeliever.<br>  <br>  Agnosticism is simply believing that it is impossible to be sure.<br>  <br>  There are such things as Agnostic Atheism and Agnostic Theism. ALso, there's weak and strong Agnosticism. Strong means that you believe "I can't know if God exists and neither can you." Weak means that "I don't know if God exists, but maybe someday there will be some way to find out."|`|6Nuaqihpaa	2.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	More like:<br>  <br>  3) It is extremely improbable that any god exists because of the total lack of objective evidence that supports that existence.

Second, the answer is no.|`|l6Jew1qAaa	It is clear that you only perceive the physical...<br>  Whether you choose to believe it or not, there are two realms of reality...the natural or physical realm and the spiritual realm. <br>  <br>  (NIV) 1Corinthians 15:35-49<br>  But someone may ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?" 36How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 38But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. 39All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. 40There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. 41The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.<br>  <br>   42So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 43it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.<br>        If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being"[e]; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. 46The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 47The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. 48As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we[f] bear the likeness of the man from heaven.|`|sjYBcnYLaa	what?

Where christianity takes moral stand, atheism takes a moral stand against theirs; however, like a faithful AGNOSTIC (they must see proof of anything with their own eyes), they revolve around ONLY that which christianity has DONE.  They leave the rest to them, waiting for them to DO something about it.<br>  <br>  The next great atheistic movement is merely going to be a counter of christianity's next action.  "Like good amoebas, they only act when stimulated."  This is because organized christianity, in waiting for their 'savior', might pull some religious strings to keep 'faith' in them alive.  Not faith in their diety.  This is important because in the DOING of anything, they must leave 'god' out and resort to more humanistic measures.  "Enter the atheist."<br>  <br>  Where the United States is concerned, atheism as a whole has been doing this at least since the signing of the Constitution!<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  How can an atheist argue against a christian when they begin to exhibit emotional signs, talking about love and such, when speaking about their beliefs?  After all, no atheist can counter the "fact" that we all have tons of emotions and can be driven to such depending on our emotional threshold?

It emerges that explanations in terms of electron orbitals, and indeed all talk of orbitals in chemistry, is not sanctioned by our present understanding of quantum mechanics. The remarkable fact is that at the most fundamental quantum mechanical level electronic orbitals become ontologically redundant. Electronic orbitals simply do not exist<br>  according to quantum mechanics, although they remain as a very useful explanatory device. This result is embodied in the more fundamental version of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which is frequently forgotten at the expense of the restricted and strictly invalid version of the Principle, which does uphold the notion of electronic orbitals (Eric Scerri 1991, 1995).<br>  <br>  <br>  The Br?nsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases is wrong for philosophical reasons, my little fako chemist. <br>  <br>  Readers, This guy thinks you're stupid.|`|AA12070800	yay! i hate hydrogen.

4wH3Hvcxaa	A brand new car or house !i|`|eAMq1iBWaa	One of the most common questions I get on this site is: do you give gifts at a bar or bat mitzvah, and if so, what kind of gifts? <br>  <br>  Yes, gifts are commonly given. They are ordinarily given at the reception, not at the service itself. Please keep in mind that a bar mitzvah is incorporated into an ordinary sabbath service, and many of the people present at the service may not be involved in the bar mitzvah. <br>  <br>  The nature of the gift varies significantly depending on the community. At one time, the most common gifts were a nice pen set or a college savings bond (usually in multiples of $18, a number that is considered to be favorable in Jewish tradition, see: Hebrew Alphabet: Numerical Values). In many communities today, however, the gifts are the same sort that you would give any child for his 13th birthday. It is best to avoid religious gifts if you don't know what you're doing, but Jewish-themed gifts are not a bad idea. For example, you might want to give a book that is a biography of a Jewish person that the celebrant might admire.

I get enough scary stories by reading Voice of the Martyrs Newsletter or magazines or books.  People all over the world have many scars from the past.  The quickest way to get over it is to trust the Lord completely.  Look to him for he is your answer.  Forgive whoever did some bad thing to you---could be they didn't want to but somehow the devil got ahold of them and God allowed you to get tested.  So, our spiritual warfare is not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.  Casting down imaginations and bringing every thought captive to the knowledge of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  So, if the devil is playing with your mind, you can do this, and get more to pray with you too, to overcome and win the victory.
cic4J2hzaa	I dont know. They think all we do is shove our religious beliefs down there troats which i dont....i just answer there questions according to what God would tell them....but anyway...Just remember this scripture..<br>  Every knee will bow and every tounge WILL confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.....God wins in the end....They can blame God for whatever they want or they can not believe in him period but one day they will see. Take care.|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	Because they think there is no God that exists who can judge them.  Now, I do believe in God, but your question doesn't make theists look very smart.|`|QroOULvPaa	atheists do not believe they know. its called science.|`|OlLMoT5Daa	OK - let's ask you this.<br>  <br>  Just because you don't believe in faeries, does that mean they don't come into your house and mess about with your stuff?<br>  <br>  Where is the proof that ONE god gets to judge the actions of all? That's like saying a person who worships Kali is going to get judged by the Christian version of god. Unlikely.  Not his follower, not their pantheon or dogma.<br>  <br>  And so if there is a god that judges all, what happens when the atheists go to heaven anyway, because they have been, overall, pretty good people?  God judges the whole picture, not just one belief.<br>  <br>  maybe one day, someone will have belief strong enough that they can jump out that window and instead of falling, they float.  You can't say it doesn't happen, because you can't know everything that goes on world wide, every second of the day.|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	mainly because there is no god, gravity on the other hand is real|`|FrdSJmJ5aa	Because belief in God is a paradox. If you look at it from the viewpoint that the concept of faith is actually a mechanism of control, then you can't in good conscious believe in god. Its kinda hard to explain really, because not many religious people are willing to accept that faith is, in fact, not actually a divine quality.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	You are assuming that God is real.  There is proof of gravity all around us.  There is no proof of God.  I can't be judged by something that does not exist and I will not live my life in fear of something that you believe in.  If it turns out that you are right and I am wrong, I will gladly go to hell.|`|hxTjtzISaa	Because god is not real.|`|cXXJVz64aa	We don't believe in your god.

I'm not saying for sure God doesn't exist (personally i think its probably BS), but he can only judge if he is.  Gravity is dumb example b/c is it obvious: you jump off a building-you fall-you die.  It proves its existence just be existing.  The only evidence of God, however, is the bible and "personal testimony" so to speak.  Whether or not you believe in those sources is up to each individual person, but it your logic that's screwy.  Religious beliefs aside, certain things follow another.  For instance, if I was never born, I never could have typed this message.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you also base your question on the idea that you know best, in that you know god exists and atheists are in the wrong, thus they will be judged anyway.  If it was 100% or close to it provable that god exists, than your argument might make sense.  But as it is, that is not the case because if you are wrong, well, you prob know where I'm going...|`|6nn7f41Faa	How can anyone be judged by someone or something that does not exist?|`|0ALinE42aa	Gravity has been proven to be real.

4aveC2aaaa	my father's brother does that. actually, he doesnt email nor call. and only says hi when we visit palestine. <br>  <br>  what do we do? well my uncle completely ignores me and my family for no reason after all that we have done for him. i dont care about that, its not the money or the wealth. but after all, we are family. i dont know what is wrong with people. <br>  <br>  we keep praying that Allah makes them better people and maybe one day they will realize. and if not, Allah will do something to them for the bad they have done. i stand by the line:<br>  <br>  "WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND"|`|7Q33v5hOaa	i would reply :-) obviously they still care about you one way or another, otherwise they wouldnt have emailed. reply sis cos they are still family afterall, maybe he/she wants to say sorry.|`|Tledw3eAaa	I would respond, and be sure to go into detail about how wonderful my husband and kids were doing.<br>  <br>  Regardless of whether they asked asked about them, if you live with family that is a part of your life, they are a part of you.. and when someone asks about you they shouldn't expect only the bits and pieces that make up who you are.<br>  <br>  Besides, if the spouse and kids were somehow a reason behind not speaking, it might just be that the person doesn't want to bring up a part of the past that will cause any tension. Maybe they just want a fresh start, and thought it best to simply say hi before asking anything else.<br>  <br>  Can't hurt to be honest and bring up the important people and things in your life though.|`|aYi8oEkJaa	i would mail back something like this : <br>  " Alhamdulilah me, my wife and kids are all fine. what about you and ur family ... hope everything is good. its been so long and i am glad you asked" <br>  <br>  we should not do what they do to us. =)<br>  and about the dad's side... well, they talk to us but the sisters have some kind of a problem ... lol! .. universal problem!|`|kkO87h0Xaa	He probably doesn't know if you're married or have kids.<br>  <br>  I would reply, and ask him/her how he was doing, and how life is going with him/her.<br>  <br>  --OH. Lol. Hmm, yeah. My dad's side of the family is troublesome too. Haha. Weird.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	I'd just talk to them normally. My family aren't really close anywayz|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	You know there aer alot of families that believe that "family is family" blood is blood.  Me, personally, I don't believe that, i've experienced more of a family bond from people who were NOT my family then I have from my own real blood family who some have treated me terribly over the years.  I've heard from so many people that family is family and that is taht...I personally think people no matter who they are need to be held responsible for their actions and how they treated you and how they affected your life.  Everyone needs to be held accountable.  so that's the first part of my answer, just because it's your sibling don't let people tell you that you have to let everythign go and just forgive and forget.  Now, on to the email that is pretty random, I would definitely wait otu a response for a week or so, not just to make them wonder but so you are decided completely on your answer.  I am a firm believer in bieng a straight shooter in life,  blunt and tell it like it is.  You don't have to be mean but tell him/her exactly what your feeling and thinking.  I woudl say something like:<br>  <br>  "I was surprised to hear from you after so many years and cant help but wonder what brought on this change of heart.  It's not that I wish or want to stay estranged from you but I simply can't just go about small talk without resolving years of pain and confusion for me.  <br>  <br>  I would also tell him/her that your family (husband, kids) have been there all along and helped you through the times when it was particularly hard to be without family (holiday,s etc) and let him know that it bothers you that they don't inquire as to how your family is.  <br>  <br>  I'm not telling you to start a fight, this person is reaching out to you, realizing life is short and wanting a chance back in your life but is doing a really bad job at it...i'm just saying, resolve the isssues and hold them accountable, this small talk, hey how are you doing stuff just won't work.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|yBJSqDliaa	You know sometimes, differences arise. But we should be ready to make amends. So my friend i want to remind you to let it go.

7ZqSiZqUaa	the best revenge is to succeed at something -tmaybe even something that they think they're good at.<br>  <br>  the next best thing is to ignore them completely - anyone who puts someone else down is a moron and not worth worrying about<br>  <br>  PS those who brag are bostering up thier own lack of confidence - people who really are popular don't have time to brag about it!  people who really are good at something don't need to constantly show other people thier medals.  *they* know they're good and that's all they need.  excess bragging is a sure sign of insecurity.  when she starts, just smile pityingly and get on with your life.|`|cBu32Zixaa	She's obviously insecure. I think that the worst thing you can do is put her down- this is just her way of dealing with people. Some people really have problems with humility.

AA11263450	Does she just lack confidence or is she non-trusting?  These are two very different reasons for this behavior with different solutions.  Controlling is more of a demand to know who you are with, exact time you will be back...etc.  From your question, it sorta appears she is just insecure, clingy, needy and can't do anything much without you.  What are your ages?  I really need that info to continue.  Just my thoughts.<br>  <br>  Okay, new reply as per your request :)    At 22, you two have just begun a life together.  Do you both have jobs?  Are there money issues?  Do you control the money and the bills?  Is everything split equably?  My partner used to be very capable of independence and now a serious medical condition makes her incapable of having anything to do with money.  But we can still argue about it, she hates to have to ask me for everything.  My partner is very needy, clingy and dependent on me.  Sometimes, I hate it.  But I love her enough to try to work through it.  Some people can't handle that though, and that is okay.  What I really want you to ask yourself is these main questions to continue this relationship...Do you think lovingly think of her many times a day?  Now the really important things for a long term partnership...do you both have the same dreams/ideas for your future together?  Do you share many hobbies/interests?  share the same morals/ethics/religion?  same friends?  These are the things that hold one thru a lifetime, trust me, 29 years of a monogamous relationship.  Sex alone is NOT enough to keep it going.  Now, one more point...as this is akin to my partner too...perhaps might your girl need pysche meds?  Mine is on Effexor and believe me there are some people who really need medication for many reasons beside depression, anger(my partner's problem) and there is paranoia.  I'm not saying this is your girl, but it could be investigated by a pyschotherapist.  Most are free or low-cost through county services.  I hope I've given you some food for thought.  Good luck.

UmjJmYsjaa	What exactly dont you understand? Or think we dont understand? Athiest perspective?<br>  <br>  If you're talking about History. THe bible has been correct. Historians thought the Sargon, an Assyrian King didnt exist an so they made fun of the bible, UNTIL they found his whole temple or what ever it was. The Egyptians have some of thier history in thier conquest agains Judah in the Walls of Thebes. Then there is the Cyrus Cylinder talking about the Jews and Giving back the vessels of Yahweh back to the Jews. Then there is the Babylonian king Nebucchanezzar and the relics left behind talking about the kings that he conquered. The bible played a big role in history, even Alexander the Great was said to have read the Book of Daniel, when he passed by Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  Daneil 8:21,22 - "The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king. 22 The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.

I cannot deny that, but know that it only begun after the apostles died, after 95AD.<br>  <br>  But that is not a cause to become Athiest just due to some ignorant men. It is true that there have been alot of atrocities due to Church officials.<br>  <br>  PS: I do agree with you on this, and there are alot of things that are unbiblical.

But we must dig to find what the truth is.|`|AA11923447	Of course, I paid attention. I grew up attending Christian schools, and we were fully taught about the atrocities of organized religion. We were told that our generation must never allow such things to happen again. So we were taught about social justice, equality and tolerance. It is important to speak out against those who attempt to bully others in the name of religion. Additionally, I am a strong supporter of the separation of church and state, and oppose attempts at drafting religious beliefs (mine or anybody else's) into law.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Glad you said that because if you paid attention from 450 BC to about 300 BC you would have seen why the corruption and creation of religion during this times argued for a God !!!!!!<br>  <br>  Socrates was put to death for atheism and Plato systematically destroyed the stupidity of the Greek gods.

We studies Modern World History so it wasn't an issue. In RS we did however study other theories for the creation of the world, and I did pay attention, and got an A* (100%) in GCSE because just because I believe one thing, it doesn't mean I will turn my noes up and blatantly deny and refuse to listen to anything else. I'm currently reading the God delusion. That's how you learn, by exploring the information and opinions available to you, not by deciding you already know everything and blatantly ignoring everything else.<br>  <br>  Besides, that would have been rude to my teacher.<br>  <br>  For your second question, I think that people corrupt religion, not the other way round. If you take the idea of any religion, it tells you God wants you to be a good person, and any atheist can do that (Today at asda, the guy in the queue in front of me randomly let me go before him because I had less stuff) and that was a random act of kindness and human is capable of, you do not need to be religious to be good and not all religious people are good either, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I take all facts into consideration. It depends on what you have faith in. Even though there is little proof for some Biblical events dispite the Bible, I know in my heart that they are true (some may disagree and that is fine).<br>  <br>  Lots of people tell me that I am very diplomatic about stuff like this for a 15 year old who was raised into Islam and was therefore moderately religious and then converted to Christianity, but at the end of the day, God does not want us to be rude or mean to each other, just to love your neighbor and love your enemy, and all get along despite differences.<br>  <br>  =D<br>  <br>  I hope this fully answers your question!|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	different times.different standards of education,morals ,etc,in those days.people are only human and can make mistakes.  unlike God.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Why do you assume I don't understand atheists?

Or, if one single part is wrong, it can not be infallible.  Since we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that many parts are wrong, draw your own conclusions.<br>  <br>  Basically, the only rational view of the Bible is that it is historical fiction, or myth mixed with some potentially true parts.|`|XurYYreBaa	The Bible is not a single writing, but a collection of writings/books from many different persons (often anonymous) over a long span of time.  Occasionally there is dispute over the translation of various passages & anyone who doubts this should compare an older King James version with the NIV, or any other version.  The best NT example that comes to mind is, King James' text has 3 kings visit the infant Christ, but other texts translate the visitors as magi or wise men.  Big difference, no?<br>  This said, it is perfectly possible for a devout Christian to believe that some passages are not completely accurate, some are tempered with the personality of specific writers, some are meant to be understood as metaphors & some are truly inspired Divine Word.<br>  IMHO, any part of *any* sacred text that promotes hatred & violence is probably  more political than sacred.

It's like light shining through the trees, you still see the light. If you look for error in the Bible you will miss the point of the Bible. Some of the Bible is parables, or illustrations etc. Usually it's obvious that it is parable. Only people who are trying to find error will mis-interpret these things. Many people try to twist the Bible into something that it's not. Remember, infallible is a man-made word. That term could be used to point out errors.

You will also be able to discern what can be described as the "Words of a Prophet of God." <br>  <br>  3. And you will most readily observe that the bulk of the Bible is the records of eye witnessess or ear witnesses, or people writing from hearsay. As such they are the "Words of a Historian"<br>  <br>  The FIRST Type: <br>  (a) I will raise them up a prophet . . . and I will put my words in ... and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him."

(Isaiah 43:11)<br>  <br>  (c) "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the end of the earth: for I am God, and there is non else." (Isaiah 45:22)<br>  <br>  The SECOND Type:<br>  (a) "Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying Eli, Eli, lama sabachtani? . . ." (Matthew 27:46)<br>  <br>  (b) "And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord:" (Mark 12:29)<br>  <br>  (c) "And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God." (Mark 10:18).<br>  <br>  The THIRD Type:<br>  "And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he, (JESUS) came, if haply he (JESUS) might find anything thereon: and when he (JESUS) came to it, (Jesus) found nothing but leaves . . ." (Mark 11:13)<br>  <br>  The bulk of the Bible is a witnessing of this THIRD kind. These are the words of a third person. They are not the Words of God or of His prophet, but the WORDS OF A HISTORIAN.<br>  <br>  And the Christians call the Bible, Word of God. |`|KclUlBw1aa	...

How delightful for Eve, on her first day of life, to be united with a husband and head who would cherish and guide her! Together they could look forward to carrying out God’s will in beautifying and populating the earth, and having loving dominion over the animal creation. What a grand future God placed before them!<br>  <br>  A rebellious spirit creature selfishly took himself out from under God’s love, making himself into Satan the Devil. This Devil persuaded Eve, and through her, Adam, to ‘do their own thing.’ Thus, they took a selfish course, independent of their Creator. But in doing this, they showed themselves completely unworthy of their Creator’s love. So God rightly passed the sentence of death on those willful sinners. Yet, out of his love for mankind, he permitted them to survive until they could produce children, otherwise we would not be alive right now. Moreover, though the human race had inherited sin and death from our first parents, the loving God provided a basis for hope.—Gen. 3:16-23; Rom. 8:20, 21.<br>  <br>  At the very onset of rebellion, God made known that he would raise up a ‘Seed,’ that is, an offspring. He would send this One forth from his own loyal heavenly organization to undo all the damage caused by the Devil, and Adam and Eve. However, back there in Eden, the loving God also declared that he would execute vengeance upon Satan and all others who would make themselves part of the offspring of Satan by turning from God’s love.—Gen. 3:15; Rev. 12:9.<br>  <br>  So the God of love declared himself also to be a God of vengeance. But his taking vengeance on his enemies would be right. Why so? Because it would clear the way for all persons who love God to be glad, to rejoice. Surely, we now can rejoice that God will clear the way for us to enjoy his provision of everlasting life. Notice what God inspired Moses to say: “Be glad, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and he will pay back vengeance to his adversaries.”—Deut. 32:43.<br>  <br>  Yet, repeatedly, the Bible tells us that the ‘God of love’ is also a ‘God of vengeance.’ Why? Because God’s love cannot forever tolerate evil. (Nah. 1:2; Deut. 32:35, 41) That is why the apostle Paul writes about the “revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thess. 1:6-9) How important it is, then, that we come to know God! In this mixed-up world of so many different religions, how vital it is, as the Bible says, ‘to seek the true God and really find him!’—Acts 17:27.<br>  <br>  Edit - you mentioned the Canaanites.Did you know that those people used to throw their own babies into a fire as a sacrifice to their own pagan gods. - the children were alive!

In the Bible, these spirit sons are called angels. Also they are called "sons of God"(Job38:7 ; Psalm104:4 ; Hebrews1:7,13,14) God created them all perfect. Not one of them was a devil or a satan. <br>  The woprd 'devil' means slanderer and the word 'satan' means opposer.<br>  <br>  The time came, however, when one of these spirit sons of God made himself the devil, that is, a liar who speaks bad things about another. He also made himself satan, that is an opposer of God. He was not created that way, but later became that kind of person. To illustrate: A thief is not born a thief. He may come from a good family, having honest parents and law abiding brothers and sisters. But his own desire for what money can buy is what may have caused him, to become a thief. How then, did one of God's spirit sons make himself satan the devil?<br>  The angel that became the devil was present when God created the earth and later the first human couple, Adam and Eve. (Job38:4,7) So he would have heard God God tell them to have children.(Genesis1:27,28) He knew that after a while the earth would be filled with righteous people worshiping God, that was part of God's purpose. However, this angel thought a great deal of his own beauty and intelligence and wanted to receive for himself the worship that would be given to God.(Ezekiel28:13-15 ; Matthew4:10) Instead of putting this wrong desire out of his mind, he kept thinking about it. This led to his taking action to obtain the honor and importance he desired.<br>   So satan was created an angel and had powers to do good, but he turned to doing bad with those powers which will soon be taken fromm him.<br>  |`|RyhluHk3aa	Here is the truth:<br>  Before he was Satan, he was Lucifer, the anointed cherubim. (Did you know that only cherubims have wings? All other angels appeared to men on earth as men!)<br>  His secret goal was to be like the Most High God. He deceived one third of the angels, and God cast him out of heaven. By deceiving these angels, he had usurped authority in heaven, and corrupted heaven, which was why God cast him out, with those angels that he deceived. And so it is that he is called the "prince of the powers of the air".<br>  Once he was Satan, he then entered the garden, where God had put man, and entered into a serpent. He deceived Eve, and caused her to disobey God. Now, God had given man dominion over the earth, and all the beasts in it. Through his deception, Satan once again usurped authority, corrupted the earth, and gained power over the earth.<br>  <br>  Notice when Jesus is tempted by Satan after His baptism: Satan takes Jesus high up into a mountain, and tells Jesus to look, as far as He could see, and see all the kingdoms that were his (Satan's), and that he would give them to Jesus, for they were his to give, if Jesus would only worship him. Jesus did not correct Satan, and tell him that those kingdoms were not his to give. Jesus knew that they were, and Jesus simply told Satan that it is written that "Thou shalt worship the Lord God, and Him only shalt thou worship."<br>  <br>  Worth noting here that the Kingdom church Apostles will sit in judgment of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the nation Israel will accept Christ as the Messiah, and become the holy nation of priests that they were meant to be. It is through this holy nation bringing all other nations to God, that God will re-establish His authority over the earth.<br>  <br>  Believers in the Body of Christ will sit in judgment of angels, ruling and reigning with Christ, and it is through this program, that God will re-establish His authority in heaven.<br>  Nice to know the will of God, huh?|`|f03c850b840553e6b4d515cd723f6280aa	From anyone who gives it power.

(Note that many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as "vampir/wampir" secondarily from the West).

But it can be precise.<br>  <br>  Theological cults differ fundamentally from the religion they sprang from.  Hari Christners are a cult of Hindusism.  That doesn't mean they're weird or mysterious, simply that they differ fundamentally from the religion they sprang from.  Mormonism is a theological cult compared to Biblical Christianity since it presents a different Jesus and a very different way to become right before God.  Again, not bad per se, but fundamentally different.<br>  <br>  Sociological cults are those groups who use coercive influence to get and keep members.  Fear, guilt, isolation, deception, accusation are the tools of choice.  Are doctrines withheld until you're sufficiently indoctrinated?  Cult.  Are you isolated from friends and family so you can't use others to evaluate the truth claims of a given religion?  Cult.  Are you discouraged from studying all sources of information on the organization you are considering joining?  Cult.  <br>  <br>  Moonies love bomb you until you're a member, then you're on your own.  Mormon often "fellowship" you until you either reject them or join them.  And Mormon have many deep doctrines that are not presented to you until you're well socialized into the religion.  It's misleading at best.<br>  <br>  Again, the same would apply to those who are kept through fear, accusation, guilt, shame or related approaches that diminish the capacity of their followers for the sake of keeping them a member.  When you question the religion, are you attacked for not being righteous enough?  I was as a Mormon.  I simply raised logical problems in the sacred stories and found myself being questioned about my worthiness.

AA11279082	You've got it BAD, girl!!  And what you have is most definitely a crush!!  In my mind, I'm thinking, it's either the strongest yearning for love I've ever heard of, or you're the worlds best stalker!  (Kidding!).  Sometimes you just cannot describe WHY or WITH WHOM you fall in love--it just happens!  And with every person you love, there is a great deal of trust and vulnerability that you risk when letting them know!  You sound like a very sweet and sensitive girl who definitely has the warmies for one certain guy!  Give yourself the chance of a lifetime, especially if he's not involved right now!  Go ahead, tell him!!

Id say no, it will put an awkward spin on things and it will not get him to ask you out. It would be like your begging him to and thats not how a relationship starts out.

AA11991883	We used to revere doctors. These days we question more which is good. Doctor as G-d does not work for me. Have tried yoga and massage as an alternative to stress medication.

I took two, felt horrible, and flushed the rest. Went back to the dentist a month later and my blood pressure had dropped.<br>  <br>  So no, not at all.|`|AA11017231	None what so ever. I've proven them wrong so many times. Right now I am self diagnosed. My doctors agree with me but have never run a test on me. I have done much study on my problem and know more than my doctors who refuse to send me to a specialist. I know what I need to best eliminate my symptoms(the problem is incurable) but my doctors won't allow it because it is still experimental and natural.

They are no more than legal drug dealers.|`|049a5ee66231db2295d9daeba62a36bcaa	Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM for joints has proved to be very good.

Seven years ago, I had severe abdominal pain, & could not eat any solid food whatsoever.  So, I just picked out a gastroenteroligist out of the telephone book (rather than on recommendation), & he was a quack to say the least!  He wanted to hospitalize me that day & start draining fluid from my stomach which made no sense to me.<br>  <br>  Luckily, on a friend's recommendation I sought another opinion & as it turned out, surgery was needed.  Due to chronic ulcers all my life, scar tissue had created a blockage, plus an endoscopy showed an ulcer the size of Texas!  He recommended a very well known surgeon who concurred & who probably saved my life!  I am symptom free today & can eat 5 alarm chili. lol!<br>  <br>  If you have any doubts as I did with the "quack," get another opinion or even a 3rd if necessary!  There are excellent & caring doctors, just as there are those who should not be practicing.|`|y7HD8unTaa	Yes, I sure have lost my confidence in pill pushers.  I turned to meditation & food elimination & combining in order to live without all of those meds that were killing my organs one by one.  I was dying a slow death.  My spirit & soul were being denied access to my brain.  I was becoming a robot who was blinding taking orders from people who were using me for an experiment.  I got sick of it & decided to go it alone.  Life is by no means perfect & I live in a constant state of physical pain....yet I find that it feeds by creative side & I get busy doing research & experimenting on my own body in a way that suits my own needs & allows me to live another day without that numbness caused by the pill pusher of the hospitals & so-called physicians.  <br>  <br>  I once tried accupunture & it left me temporary relief.  Herbs upset my stomach.  So it wasn't working for me.  Deep tissue massage is great.  Since I can no longer afford a physical therapist, I have learned how to massage my leg & shoulder to achieve comfort.  Heat is good & a day in the sun is wonderful.  Long hot showers are all I have left.  <br>  <br>  If I took pain meds, I'd really say some racey stuff over the internet.  I just won't chance that!  I'm bad enough as I am in my natural state.  Pain keeps me humble!|`|KWwW7N49aa	You have to keep looking around. Some doctors are too busy and can't give you the quality time that you need.

I think sometimes she finds me a little "difficult" because I research before I go in to see her if I have any particular problem, I always wants to know all the side effects or symptoms that may happen, I always need to discuss the pros and cons of everything and want to know if there is any alternatives inclulding homeopathic or chinese medicines or chiropractice, or anything else.

It took me getting back in touch with the Country Doctor with the little office and two office ladies. The Dr will spend as much time with me as I need and if he can't help me, he makes the appointment for me to see another specialized Dr. He is my main Dr and he is firm and fair with me and scolds me if I need it. He always has time to see me within a day of when I call, no waiting two months for an appointment. He charges $60 dollars a visit not the 145 dollars the other ones charged, he takes the medicare insurance and I am charged nothing. He calls in my perscriptions for me and I just love it that  he took me as a patient again after so many years, trying out the city Dr.s.
FOzN3xwzaa	The Book of Hebrews makes it clear that fallen angels (of which Satan is one), can never be saved. <br>  <br>  Making him a human, is changing things too much to make any point. <br>  <br>  And the Bible never presents "gratitude" as a requirement of salvation.  <br>  Read 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Romans 10:9-10, Acts 16:31, John 3:16, John 5:24. <br>  <br>  Gratitude never comes up. <br>  <br>  We ought to be grateful of course.  But don't dare add things to the Gospel.  It is VERY dangerous to do that (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  Salvation is a free gift.|`|LZJPMl8raa	If you believe in Jesus, then you have to act on it. As James said, faith without works is dead.<br>  <br>  It is like skydiving. If you believe in the paraschute to save your life, then you have to use it. If you believe and don't use it, well, you will fall to your death.<br>  <br>  Same thing, if you belive in Jesus, then obey him and repent of your sins|`|OzHqHV5uaa	faith alone is enough.  it is not about feelings or human behavior|`|tI1NHwfBaa	This is kind of like asking "can you eat the cake, but not digest it?"|`|256t9bIqaa	You are saved when you believe in Jesus.   John 3:16.    That's all.    <br>  <br>  The English translation of the Bible falls short in this verse.<br>  <br>  John wrote his gospel is Greek.   The Greek word for "in" in Jn 3:16 is "ein."   Ein means "place your trust in" Jesus.   When you place your trust in Jesus, you do as Jesus says because you believe him.   The things you do are the Golden Rule, love one another, etc.   <br>  <br>  The other Greek word for "in" is (eis), but eis is not used in Jn 3:16.   "eis" means "in the existence of".    Satan believes "eis" Jesus, but does not believe "ein" Jesus.|`|8f1i9DWyaa	You have some great questions that blow holes in frozen doctrine. Jesus said the 2 great commandments are to love God with all our heart, soull, mind, strength and body and to love our neighbors as ourselves. So yes,  I think everything is required to get our sorry selves into heaven. Humanity needs God so badly; so thankful that He did not abandon us here on planet earth. But we have to believe in God's plan of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone. Because we had nothing to do with the work on Calvary; Jesus paid it all, all the price for our nasty sins. So why wouldn't we believe in God's wonderful plan and then praise Him and glorify His Greatness and His Wisdom and glory.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Salvation without gratitude is inconceivable to me.|`|qJXdyUY3aa	Just knowing the mere fact that Jesus is the Son of God and paid the price for all of our sins but having an attitude of ambivalence not enough to be saved and, ultimately, to get to heaven. You have to actually believe it and accept Jesus into your heart and life. Satan and all of the demons know that Jesus died and conquered the grave, but they hate him with a burning passion. That is why they try and pull away as many people from Him as they possibly can.|`|93a54e25bc4518bbeae2c0d1b7716654aa	KING JAMES SAYS:<br>  <br>  Eph II; chap 8 & 9:  For by Grace, are ye saved through Faith, that not of yourselves, it is a GIFT of God, not of works alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  First and formost, (only my personal opinion), you need to ask God to forgive you of your sins; Then believe in your heart. Let your heart dictate your actions, not your brain.|`|6jAVElX7aa	when you believe salvation is in Christ alone, then when you ask the Lord into your heart, (holy spirit)  He will flood your heart with joy that you are now saved by faith in Christ Jesus.  Then because the Holy Spirit lives in your heart, He will guide into good works, as Jesus our Lord said "without me, you can do nothing"|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	My feelings are these (and they also answer the faith vs. faith plus works):<br>  <br>  If you REALLY believe that someone died for you, can you still live in hatred toward them? Of course not. In Luke 7, Jesus says, He who is forgiven much loves much, he who is forgiven little loves little.<br>  <br>  People who claim to believe that Jesus died for them, yet live against him, show by their actions that they don't really believe it at all. To really have faith in Christ's death is more than intellectual...it is to understand that someone DIED, and a painful death at that, to forgive you for sins you committed...against that very person! It is the ultimate demonstration of sacrificial love.<br>  <br>  So, in short, I don't even think it's humanly possible to (really) believe he died for you, without being grateful (and because of that gratitiude, living for him). I think if you read James 2 carefully, you'll see this is exactly what he is talking about. Also 1John deals with this quite a bit. And Romans, interestingly enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: All I mean is, if I took a bullet for you (and suffered a slow and painful death!), how would you feel about me?|`|U51pBeLfaa	The first part is we are saved by God's grace through faith in Jesus.<br>  God's gift is free for everyone. There are no good works to buy it or pay back after receiving it. We would be grateful for the gift.<br>  <br>  Faith is acceptance of the gift. Not everyone accepts it unfortunately not all are saved. You, someone or Satan can believe that the gift is there but not accept it. You either accept it or not there is no room for ambivalence.<br>  <br>  We now have salvation. We know we are called to be holy. Therefore although salvation is by faith alone; faith is never alone. This is not an excuse to beat up sinners for not being holy. If we claim we have no sin we deceive ourselves. Just saved from sin then beating someone up (or ourselves) for sin does not make sense. However it is now an opportunity to express our gratitude and practice good works. Time to move on from milk to meat.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

The Christian god may exist to others, but he can never exist to me even if they say so. My mind won't allow it.

6dL7UGvfaa	Traditional Institutionalized Religious Practices I used to do since childhood as it was part of the family ritual but I felt them very mechanical and often acted  as a pressure creating a sort of tension in me. I gave up all as I was growing up to colleges and universities. But when I entered professional practice I saw Meditation being used as a means of relieving tension and anxiety and as a professional practitioner I could not ignore and deprive my client the rightful remedy although it smacked of religiosity. When I went to investigate the effect of meditation on mind and body by using my clients as sample, I was laughed at. Meditation is known only by self experience, not by seeing,hearing, reading but by doing. So, I was introduced to meditation in 1973 as a professional necessity as Clinical Psychologist, and I never looked back. Since then, I might have missed food, sleep, meeting my friends and so on out of pressures of work but never, never missed my meditation even a single day! It at once offered me deep relaxation, peace, intense but scintillating alertness, energy and freshness which none my earlier childhood religious practices offered. The experience of unity - connectedness - with all that exist ( animate and inanimate ) and a feeling of love flowing through all in that connection. I thought this is spirituality. Perhaps, originally, religion came into existence to kindle this spirituality in us but somehow it inherited the ills of any established institutionalized system with all the attended vested interest, politics and what not.Now,the Religion  is offering  everything else but spirituality! <br>  <br>  Spirituality has offered me strength to weather any crisis in life in calm by allowing(not resisting) all the forces within and out and beyond me to enter and navigate me.<br>  <br>  Life and death cycle go on till the effects of our deeds - good and bad - are cleared, divinity realized and embodied.|`|AA11586837	Hello!<br>  I was raised Catholic.

I don't meditate, never have never will. I handle the lows in life by keeping cool about it and trying to think positive(i know that sounds a little stupid).I don't pray or nothing like that. I don't think the higher power cares about us its just studying us. I don't think there is anything after life. Its like before you were born, nothingness. That seems very peaceful to me.
UmjJmYsjaa	So why is Jesus spelled with a J<br>  and why is Joshua spelled with a J<br>  <br>  Why do Italains say Gesu Cristo, for Jesus, thats not a J<br>  Why do Japanese say Ehoba for Jehovah or Yahweh.<br>  <br>  About corrupting Biblical names. Jehovah witnesses are not the only ones to say that name. THe Catholic Church when Latin was the common language used Iehova. when it went to Englsih it was later used Jehovah. So dont say that Jehovah is only from JW's.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lets compare Joshua and Jehovah.<br>  When i compared the name Joshua (YHVSH) to Jehovah (YHVH or Yahweh) the first three characters are the same, but nobody discredits Joshua as being an actual name when Jehovah is disregarded as Yahweh OR not even pronounced at all and just kept at YHVH OR YHWH.<br>  Joshua has the Tetragammaton (YHVH) in its name that it means "Jehovah is Salvation."<br>  <br>  THen if you want the J to be left out then change Joshua, Jeremiah, Jesus, Jacob, Hallelu jah, Jebediah, Josiah. etc....<br>  <br>  Does that mean that all of them are wrong?<br>  Even the King James BIble has the name Jehovah in it.<br>  Genesis 22:14<br>  Exodus 6:3<br>  Exodus 17:15<br>  Judges 6:24<br>  Psalms 83:18<br>  Isaiah 12:2<br>  and Isaiah 26:4<br>  Isaiah 42:8<br>  <br>  Pick a better subject.

So it's Ok to call God Jehovah if you're an English speaker.<br>  <br>  The English name Jehovah had it's source from YHWH, and it slowly evolved over time. At the time of the King James bible in 1611, it was Iehovah - again, no J. The J and Y sound are closely related in linguistics. Languages and words change over time.<br>  <br>  Joshua, Jacob, Judah, Jesus, James - all these names started with a Y in Hebrew - and most would be completely unrecognizable to a ancient Hebrew speaker. It's funny that many people who believe that Jesus is God himself have no problem calling him "Jesus." Yet they have a problem with "Jehovah." That's inconsistant.<br>  <br>  The idea that you must pronouce something with the precise sounds and vocal intonations of an ancient language has its roots in magic - something strictly forbidden in the scriptures.<br>  <br>  Since there is no scripture in the bible commanding us to pronouce God's name in a particular way, JWs will continue to pronouce the name of God in the common vernacular.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  <br>  Modern Hebrew uses V instead of W.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

ctOge9SLaa	Hello sister:)<br>  <br>  Before giving the thelogical definition, I thought it might be interesting to look up the word in the dictionary.<br>  <br>  To " Justify"  is to declare innocent or guiltless, absolve, acquit.<br>  <br>  Justification is the act of God whereby humankind is made or accounted just, or free from guilt or penalty of sin.<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/justification?qsrc=2888" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/j...</a><br>  It was interesting to see the secular take on this matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  From the Bible.<br>  Justification is God's action, whereby He approves people according to His standard of righteousness.  God can do this on the basis of the redemption of Christ.<br>  <br>  Rom 3:24<br>  Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Since Christ has paid the price for our sins and in His redemption has fulfilled all God's requirements on us, God, because He is JUST, must justify us freely.  Such justification is by the Grace of God, not by our works.<br>  <br>  Hallelujah, we have been justified and now have bold access in the Blood of our Lord Jesus to God.<br>  <br>  Grace be with you sister<br>  ty for this wonderful question,<br>  In Christ<br>  sandy|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It means to be forgiven, to have a debt paid in full. <br>  <br>  We are sinners.  Sin is a debt.  There is no way for our sins to be paid for by us.  Works do not pay for our sins.  "Good behavior" does not pay for our sins.  <br>  <br>  The only acceptable payment for our sins, is Jesus.  Jesus dying on the cross.  <br>  <br>  When Jesus died on the cross, then He paid for all sins of all people.  And then Jesus rose from the dead.  To be saved, you must believe it.  <br>  <br>  And when you believe it, then you are JUSTIFIED.  In heaven, you are seen as Jesus is, without sin.  Because Jesus's perfect obedience is exhanged for your sinful record.  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)
kWz0nEdBaa	When I was a child I was taught that when you go to the priest to confess your sins you will have absolution, say prayers for penance, and receive communion wafer, and everything is all right between me and God.  When I got converted, the Scriptures tell me that therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin.  But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	The Protestant articulation of soteriology (theology of justification) is as follows: <br>  We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, apart from good works. <br>  <br>  The  Catholic position: <br>  We are saved by grace alone through faith infused works. <br>  <br>  The difference here is very subtle. Protestants see justification as a single act in time, whereby the sinner accepts what has already been done in Jesus Christ and claims it for him or herself. There is an exact moment of decision to place your faith in Christ. At that moment, you are "born again" and made right with God as an absolutely free gift. Faith is knowing that you are saved by what Christ has done for you. <br>  <br>  For the Protestant, what separates Christianity from all other religions is that in Jesus Christ, the work has been done for us so that there is nothing left to do but accept the free gift in trusting faith. <br>  <br>  Protestants say we are saved by a faith that produces works, but the works themselves do not save us and are not necessary. Works are done in gratitude as the soul is freed from the bondage of guilt. Protestants may see these works as an outward sign that salvation has already taken place. However, such works have no merit to the person. We are all equals before God, and no one person has more merit than another, and no one person has greater guilt than another. While there may be degrees of reward in heaven and degrees of pain in hell, the fundamental option toward heaven or hell is not based in any way on the merit of works or the demerit of sin. <br>  <br>  With the Protestants, Catholics believe that salvation is by grace alone, such that all people who will be saved are saved by Christ, and we can rightly say that God is the initiator of salvation and the one who brings the work to completion. Salvation is a free gift and we do not earn it through our works. <br>  <br>  Likewise, with the Protestants, Catholics see faith as a necessary component of salvation. We must trust the one who started the work in us to bring it to completion.<br>  <br>  However, Catholics speak of salvation in terms more akin to a process. There is not a single moment which one can point to where one is considered right with God. Indeed, to the Roman Catholic, as long as you are alive on earth, God is still working out your own salvation with you. There is God's initiation and then there is the response of the human person. This is not a one time deal, but an ongoing relationship made possible by what Jesus did on the cross. <br>  <br>  With the Protestant, the Catholic wants to emphasize that we need to trust God in this process, which is what faith is. However, the Catholic does not see faith as a single act on a particular date where you know that you have already been saved. <br>  <br>  Instead, the Catholic speaks of the "born again" experience as a beginning that started with baptism, but continues throughout life until death. Only at the moment of death will the final result be known with absolute certitude. <br>  <br>  Catholics go on to say that grace is defined as God's life entering into the soul. With this act of God, faith, hope and love are infused in the soul so that good works are inspired by God. These grace inspired works have merit because it is God inspiring, and even to some extent, doing the works in a believer. <br>  <br>  Yet, because the subject being saved is cooperating with this grace in the performance of the works, the merit is rightly applied to that individual as an application of the completed work of the cross to the individual. The Catholic also maintains that a person who is not doing good works may not have grace operating in her or him. <br>  <br>  Thus, good works are necessary to salvation.|`|vouUQQzBaa	In Christian theology, justification is God's act of declaring or making a sinner righteous before God. The concept of justification occurs in many books of the Old and New Testaments.<br>  <br>  The extent, means, and scope of justification are areas of significant debate. Broadly speaking, Catholics and Orthodox Christians distinguish between initial justification—which occurs in baptism—and final justification, accomplished after a lifetime of striving to do God's will. Protestants believe that justification is a singular act in which God declares an unrighteous individual to be righteous because of the work of Jesus. Justification is granted to all who have faith, but even that is viewed as a gift from God (compare Eph 2:8).<br>  <br>  Justification is seen by Protestants as being the theological fault line that divided Roman Catholic from Protestant during the Reformation[1].|`|eZA1ZBSaaa	catholics feel it is an ongoing process. protestants feel it is a one time thing, once saved always saved, which isn't in the bible

8ifjeqqQaa	See this is a good question.<br>  <br>  God did not created flawed human beings; he created humans with the right to choose.  We have choice and that is what makes us different than any old machine.  God wants us to love him by our own choosing not because we are forced to, because that is not love that is duty or obligation.<br>  <br>  Because of choice death entered into the world (adam and eve)  Death is the punishment for sin.  God is so holy so righteous so good that he cannot "just accept" sin and evil.  He even turned from Jesus when Jesus took on our sins.<br>  <br>  God is not setting us up for damnation.  Jesus redeemed us so that we are good again by believing in him and God.  It is by pure belief that we can have eternal life with God.  It is our choice.|`|VgfUAleGaa	God is perfect<br>  So therefore, anything he creates is perfect, unless He chooses not to make it perfect.<br>  <br>  He created us flawed on purpose, then punishes humanity with the Original Sin when Eve ate the fruit.

We have a choice whether to obey God or disobey God. <br>  We do not have to endure eternal death for our flaws. God is a God of justice, but He is a God of love. That's why He sent Jesus to save us from our sinful nature. (the sin came down in the DNA, all the way back to Adam and Eve) <br>  God does not want to live in the universe alone. He wants a family. He wants a loving group of people around Him that love Him back. People that respond to His big love. God wants to be loved, too. But all He gets from spiritually ignorant and rebellious people are backs that are turned to Him and accusations that He's mean and unjust. It's time to stop accusing Him and start seeking Him out without trying to put fingers in His eyes. God is on the throne in heaven, satan isn't. God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. Start seeking Him. Otherwise, you'll never know what He will do for you. (God has done a lot for me.)|`|Dhujji4Haa	our forefather Adam was perfect but through his sin with Eve by eating the apple we were flawed and death passed onto man. God accepts us but when he commands us not to do something and we do it, then we have to face him. and if we are his children he chastises us. God only gives eternal death to those who choose not to believe on him. That's why he sent his only begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins; eternal death is only onto those who haven't believed on him. But heaven is promised to his children and ones he calls his own.|`|EI9dKzy9aa	he does accepted our flaws that's why he hasn't flooded the earth like in noah's time. he accepts us because<br>  "For God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him shall not parish, but have Eternal life."<br>                                                         -John 3:16 NIV<br>  <br>  God loves each one of us.we have the choice of hell or heaven. some people CHOOSE to go to Hell by ejecting the Christian Faith .we have free will.

Humans are the only creatures on earth to have free will.  God made us that way.  I think he made us 'imperfect' on purpose, because perfect beings can't learn and grow and mature, and that's what he wanted us to do.  <br>  <br>  I think he deliberately designed Adam and Eve in such a way that he knew they'd eat the fruit.  Then he put these two brand-new individuals in a garden and told them everything was there for them to use any way they wanted, except this one beautiful tree right in the middle of the garden.  This is like leaving a four-year-old alone in a room with a wedding cake.<br>  <br>  All of the history of human development stems from the 'sin' of Adam and Eve.  What if they hadn't eaten the fruit?  There would be no story!  Just two 'perfect' people living forever in a garden.  The whole Bible would be three pages long, and we wouldn't be here to read it anyway.<br>  <br>  Mind you, I don't believe Genesis is literally true.  I see it as allegory.  Every creation story has to explain why, if God is perfect, and we are his creation, why we aren't perfect.  And the answer is that human nature was designed to deal with conflict, to grow and mature, to be creative, to consider hypotheticals, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  As for your second question--Why God had to send his son (or himself) to suffer and be tortured and die so that he could forgive us for our imperfections, why couldn't he just forgive us himself because, after all, he made us that way on purpose--that is a good question!

Then the fig leaves, and then God killed a sheep for their clothing. <br>    We have a choice as did Adam and Eve. Do we with free will serve Him and obey Him, or not. If we chose to serve Him Mark 12:29-31; Matthew 22:37-40; Exodus 20; Deut 5 and surrender all of ourselves to Him, This is what He is asking from us, to die to selves and serve Him. He created us to worship Him and not sin. Jesus Christ died for us and His precious Blood is our way into heaven, But please look at 1 John 3, Will you continue to sin knowing the consiquinces, you chose hell not Father God for you, 2 Peter 3:9

I don't believe that it's the right religion for every person in the US, much less in the world.  I actually believe that 'atheism' and agnosticism is 'right' for some of those who believe in them, while Buddhism, Taoism, or any of the Native American and all other religions are 'right' for some of their believers.  I have been offered 'full ordination' as a Baptist minister when I was a practicing Episcopalian (with me remaining an Episcopalian, too), as well as the chance to become the first 'fully ordained' Vietnamese Buddhist monk when I was a Vedantist (a sub-sect of the Hindu religion).  Yes, I have seriously studied the 'religions of the world' and yes, I can see far more 'the same' in all of them than I can 'differences.'  What you are should 'fit well' but not 'be perfect' ... if you don't have 'room to grow' in your religion, then you should think about finding a new one, because 'growth' is learning, and learning is essential in all religions if you truly want to 'believe' properly!

Anything a Black says against whites will not affect whites in an influential way because they really have no way of affecting things but if it is allowed the other way the minority can be over taken incredibly easily .  <br>  It can't work both ways unless the people were equal in numbers.  <br>  A white persons way of life is not going to change because someone says "hon kee" in public. But if a white people go back to saying N word then things could go out of control.<br>  Not saying racism is right either way.|`|V69pvYEqaa	because black ppl are ignorant and they hate the white man so much and were the ones who pax taxes for the welfare they are on go back to africa|`|axylPYftaa	whites are the majority, and blacks are the minorities, so theyre viewed as the underdogs|`|v1JBAwSTaa	Its not true, remember only Whites can be racist or else its called "Reverse Racism"|`|tehdmkjkaa	They think they are better then anyone else.|`|HM2pvjWmaa	Slavery.

Wouldn't that stop all the wars and strife going on?  Wouldn't that bring love of fellow man and peace to the earth?  Hell No!  Because somewhere some one or some group would want "more".  There is always the greed issue because that is human nature.  It really isn't about race, never was.  If you check out history it was always about greed and power.<br>  <br>  How many people realize that if they checked out Black history back in Africa some of the most profuse traffickers in slave trading were Black Africans?  Does that shock you?<br>  Once again I emphasize this is not a question of race but a question of human nature and mans inhumanity to man.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	some think that they have earned that right. because of history.|`|5tY3eZcoaa	Society was taught to be sensitive to them because of history, but despite Blacks who are successful or aren't the ones bringing negative light to the black community, people always judge a whole race by the negatives.  And those black people you are talking about are the ones that give them a bad name, people like Oprah, Bill Cosby, would say the same.  Many people in society instead accept the racism against Whites.|`|8e0955220ed4a4405d699fae1bf2b11faa	because black people think that whites gave us a reason to hate you. nobody that is alive today owned slaves, so i feel no need to have hatred towards white people. i mean, i dislike whites and blacks and anyone else with a narrowminded, negative attitude.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Because if anyone ever said anything about it they'd be called a racist.

0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	"friendships of princes" - I think it's an allusion to Horace's Odes, Book 2, Ode 1.<br>  <br>  Edit: It makes a lot of sense actually - this ode is about writing poetry and plays about Roman history. The part with "principium amicitias" (or really "principum" - it's not usually an i-stem noun) is talking about the civil wars particularly. I can see the connection to Shakespeare's historical plays, which treated the Wars of the Roses the same way.

xyIZv6iiaa	First of all --- context is everything when trying to determine the meaning of something said - when put into context (included at the end of this answer) one can see that that was not what BY was saying at all --- he was speaking of JS as the prophet of the time.<br>  <br>  No mortal's role in the judgment supercedes the role given to Jesus, as the Book of Mormon bears witness: 2_Ne. 9:41.  However, as a prophet of Our Lord Jesus Christ - JS may well be called to witness for or against us, as any other prophet may be.<br>  <br>  BY's Comment --- "Joseph Smith holds the keys of this last dispensation, and is now engaged behind the vail in the great work of the last days...no man or woman in this dispensation will ever enter into the celestial kingdom of God without the consent of Joseph Smith.... I will now tell you something that ought to comfort every man and woman on the face of the earth. Joseph Smith, junior, will again be on this earth dictating plans and calling forth his brethren to be baptized for the very characters who wish this was not so, in order to bring them into a kingdom to enjoy...he will never cease his operations, under the directions of the Son of God, until the last ones of the children of men are saved that can be, from Adam till now.... It is his mission to see that all the children of men in this last dispensation are saved, that can be, through the redemption"|`|jdRKZe18aa	I personally put my trust and faith in GOD not Brigham Young... even as a member of the church "Journal of Discourses" IS NEVER a place I would go for prophetic info or doctrinal understanding... to put it mildly.

Likewise, every ecclesiastical authority from Bishop clear up to prophet will be a judge over those for whom they were responsible.  Each Bishop will present his "flock" to the Stake Presidents.  They, in turn, will present their stakes to the Area Authorities who will then present them to the General Authorities.  The Prophets will then present their "flocks" to in this dispensation to Joseph Smith, who is the head of this dispensation of the gospel and priesthood.  Joseph, along with the other leaders, Abraham, Noah, Enoch, Moses and Peter will then present their respective dispensations to Adam, the Father of mankind, who will present his family to Christ who then presents us to the Father.  Everything in its proper order.  <br>  Thus, those of this dispensation will be presented by Joseph Smith as Brigham Young stated.  <br>  This is not shocking, but rather makes sense.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Interesting quote. <br>  <br>  Note that you have ellipses in it that takes out what was before all that. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't believe misconstrued quotes. It's an easy thing of scholarship that people put [....] when they don't want to put in the whole material in. It generally means that they want to prove a point in a paper. I've taken lots of classes as a person with an English degree and you do that to prove your point of view. Same thing here.<br>  <br>  Edit: And here's the whole source material <a href="http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/JournalOfDiscourses3,2855" rel="nofollow">http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/JournalO...</a><br>  <br>  Bringham Young is talking about the priesthood that was restored through Joseph Smith and his holding of the keys of the Priesthood.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Because even Joseph Smith said God is the only Judge, and we don't believe quotes from Brigham Young taken out of context.|`|AA11636949	I will be more than happy to answer your question when you give the entire quote and not just the convenient part that helps you prove some point.|`|yakmXr5Jaa	When Brigham Young said that Joseph Smith would judge the people of our day, that was completely consistent with the Bible.<br>  <br>  In 1 Corinthians 6:2, Paul told the Corinthians they would judge the world.<br>  <br>  Mormons believe each dispensation will be judged by the leaders God called for that time period.  The church leaders called in Corinth and Ephesus will judge the people of their time, under the supervision of the apostles Christ called during his ministry.  Those apostles will ultimately report to Peter, the chief apostle, who reports to Christ.<br>  <br>  That's where the belief came from that when you get to the pearly gates you meet Saint Peter.  Because he's in charge of the judging.<br>  <br>  Moses will judge the people of his day.  Noah will judge the people of his day.<br>  <br>  This completely fits the pattern of the way God works in other things, too.  God doesn't do everything himself in person.  He sends messengers and calls others to carry out his work.  And those people represent Him.  That's why when holy messengers visit Abraham in Genesis 18, some of the time it is phrased as if it were God himself that visited him.<br>  <br>  And when an angel visits John in Revelation 22, the angel clearly establishes that he is not the Lord, but then speaks directly as if he were the Lord, "I am Alpha and Omega", etc.<br>  <br>  So, yes, if God called a prophet in our day, then that prophet represents Him, speaks for Him, and will judge the people of our time.  That's completely consistent with the Bible.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Jesus said that the Apostles would judge the 12 tribes.  I can see how the scribes and Pharasees would have reacted to such a prospect.  I assume the Prophets and Apostles of this dispensation will have similar duties.  <br>  <br>  Matthew 19:28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	You evidently misunderstand the quote.  Go back and reread it and you will see that it states that Jesus Christ is our judge.  Christ is our advocate with the father.  It also says that each prophet of each dispensation of time will be there, including Joseph Smith for this last dispensation of time, but that Christ is our judge.<br>  <br>  That is Mormon doctrine, that Jesus Christ is our judge.  Pure and simple.|`|AA10637643	What's your point?  God is right or Brigham....?<br>  <br>  God said Christ is the Judge.  Period.|`|AA10066888	You need to follow the living prophet|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	The passage you refer to does not ever say that Joseph Smith will be the judge of everyone it says that "   Joseph Smith holds the keys of this<br>  last dispensation" and because of that "no man or woman in this dispensation will ever enter into the celestial kingdom of God without the consent of Joseph Smith."<br>  <br>  To understand that quote you first need to understand what the word Keys is referring to. the following is a quote taken from one of our scripture study aids.<br>  "Keys are the rights of presidency, or the power given to man by God to direct, control, and govern God’s priesthood on earth. Priesthood holders called to positions of presidency receive keys from those in authority over them. Priesthood holders use the priesthood only within the limits outlined by those who hold the keys."<br>  <br>  Moroni in the Book of Mormon phrased the same concept a little differently<br>  "And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?"<br>  <br>  You will be judged by God and He will have His servants there like Moroni and Joseph Smith and many others, to testify for or against you. Why does God want other people there? couldn't He just pass judgment Himself? We are repeatedly taught throughout the scriptures that God wants two or three witnesses to establish any word.<br>  Deuteronomy 17:6<br>  Deuteronomy 19:15<br>  Matthew 18:16<br>  2 Corinthians 13:1<br>  The passages in Deuteronomy specifically say that God even wants 2 or 3 witnesses to condemn someone to death. So the reason that God does not just pass judgment Himself is because He follows his own commandments.<br>  <br>  Edit: I thought a bit of clarification on the word dispensation might be in order as well. Again from one of our study aids I quote.<br>  "A gospel dispensation is a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood." <br>  <br>  So basically that passage is saying that Joseph Smith will be a witness in the trial of everyone who has lived since the Lord restored the Priesthood to Joseph Smith.

Diamonds, rubber, and many other goods were used to make Europe rich while Africa was left in poverty.

tYqUutidaa	Intelligent or Traditional Hauntings<br>  <br>  This type of haunting is what most people think of when they hear the word ghost.  Unfortunately these types of hauntings are very rare.  An intelligent or traditional ghost is kind of like Casper in the sense that they interact with people.  The most common belief is that the ghost is connected to the site or people in some way.<br>  <br>   Some reasons the ghost may be tied to the site or people:<br>  <br>     1. Died as a result of a traumatic event, murder, car accident, etc.<br>     2. Due to unfinished business.<br>     3. The spirit may have died suddenly and not realized he/she died.<br>     4. The living loved ones are so emotionally distraught they can’t let go.<br>     5. The spirit is emotionally connected to their loved ones.<br>     6. They cannot rest due to an injustice done to them.<br>     7. Fear of the other side or judgment<br>  <br>  These ghosts are generally associated with physical activity like slamming, opening, closing, unlocking doors and windows, voices, and sounds.  A strong presence, a scent, or touch may be experienced.  People rarely see a manifestation of the ghost in the form of an apparition or mist.<br>  <br>    <br>  Residual Haunting<br>  <br>  A residual haunt is believed to be activity of reoccurring or traumatic actions from past events that leave an imprint on the environment. <br>  <br>  This type is probably the most common type of haunting. Because its' characteristics are similar to the intelligent haunting, people often mistake it for an intelligent/traditional haunting.  Like intelligent haunts, some examples of activity are phantom footsteps, sounds, images, and scents. One major difference between this haunting and the intelligent/traditional haunting, is that this type of haunting is not considered to be that of a ghost, and there is no interaction with the living.    <br>  <br>  It is believed that this activity is the dissipation of stored energy from the site. The theory is the energy is stored or absorbed by the site due to repetitive or traumatic events of the energy expended while performing such actions. Similar to a tape player, the energy is stored in the magnetic field of the environment. Over time the energy builds up and is discharged showing a replay of the event, and then the cycle starts again. Some suggest that atmospheric conditions such as storms may initiate the playback.  There is also a quantum physics theory that relates the energy as light particles that are dormant until they are stimulated by an outside variable under the proper conditions. (Brandon, The Ghost Hunters Bible) Researchers have observed that the energy tends to diminish over periods of time until eventually it is either exhausted, or the level is so low that it is not experienced again.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Portal Hauntings<br>  <br>  Portals aren't really a new concept, as we've seen them in a lot of sci-fi flicks. But in the real world portal hauntings are considered controversial as there is little known and the idea is mostly theory or speculation. Portals are thought to be doorways to another world or dimension in which entities travel through.  It's speculated that portals are not limited to one location, region or limited to sacred ground. Typically places that experience a wide array of different types of anomalous activity such as glowing balls of light, odd creatures, strange shapes, or unexplained mists or fog, are suspected to have a portal in which these energies are traveling back and forth.|`|Aoj0croZaa	Intelligent or Traditional Hauntings<br>  <br>  This type of haunting is what most people think of when they hear the word ghost.

This falls into the realm of a "demonic" or an "inhuman" type of haunting. It is perhaps of other-dimensional origin, and is often possessed (no pun intended) of a quite hostile nature. Anyone who has up close and personally encountered a demonic entity in action never wants the experience repeated; no one I've spoken to, anyway! It often evinces a form of intelligence (initially similar to a "human" type of haunting) in that it may insidiously seem to anticipate the approaches of the person(s) it menaces, including any paranormal investigators who are endeavoring to rid a home of its presence. Endemic to this most unwelcome infestation is a pronounced psychological instability, distress or unresolved conflict on the part of a resident or residents of the household subjected to the demonic assault.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Pragma, letteralmente, significa : FATTO, nel senso di avvenimento realmente accaduto. In tal senso, per derivazione e ragionamento deduttivo, si definisce PRAGMATICA una persona o un modo di pensare ed agire che, prima di appellarsi a mere teorie astratte, si esprime semplice e concretamente con i fatti effettivi, ben visibili e comprensibili a tutti. Generalmente si usa definire pragmatico l'atteggiamento di vita dei popoli anglosassoni (Inglesi, Tedeschi ed anche Americani) , le cui regole della esistenza sono in molti campi concretamente basati sulle azioni concrete e non sui pensieri astratti, i quali si addicono maggiormente alle cosiddette polazioni neolatine o mediterranee.|`|2CE1Is5caa	Si dice che è pragmatica una persona che mette in pratica soluzioni atte a raggiungere lo scopo, anche se queste non corrispondono perfettamente ad un ideale teorico o personale che se seguito con meticolosità avrebbe poche probabilità di successo.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Absolutely. It was a movie, not based on any real life occurrences. I can very easily survive in the wilderness by myself - doing it at an abandoned summer camp for a week would be a walk in the park.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Absolutely. I'd do it for free (well, I'd like travel expense reimbursed & per diem for food). But to be there alone..for a week...no biggie. <br>  <br>  It's a movie. There are no monsters or ghosts or paranormal beings...|`|Kru3PZbkaa	Most definitely.  In case you weren't aware, Friday the 13th was fiction.<br>  There is no Jason, or Mrs. Voorhees.  Where do I sign for this?  GIVE ME MY MONEY!!<br>  Sorry, I got a little carried away.  Honestly, I wouldn't trust someone who would say no to this.  I mean, really.  Again, the story is fiction, the campsite is no different than any other.

OJ had years to screw his mind up.  Chris Brown is only 19.<br>  <br>  Enough about OJ, because there's a bigger symptom here that African Americans must distance themselves from their culture even further: the secret belief that a "real," "strong" Black man keeps his wife/woman "in line" by brutalizing her physically  and that a "real," "strong" Black woman will take such abuse again and again to show that she is "for her man."<br>  <br>  I'm glad Brown was indicted 2x and gets some treatment and PUNISHMENT for brutalizing that girl in the rented Lamborghini, and I hope that Rhianna develops here considerable talents and beauty without reinforcing  uncool stereotypes like they both did recently.  Giving somebody Herpes is no excuse.  It's endemic in the American population, anyway.  It's hard to say who gave whom what.<br>  <br>  As my late, great father always taught me and my 2 brothers: no "real man" EVER strikes a woman.|`|855e3290e2f7ec6ade521df07c141b01aa	Yup its possible.

c7542c11a3b9acd45fe04819f759c984aa	You'll find many different ways of approaching the Eucharist (or communion, or the Lord's Supper) in Methodist churches.  To start off with your questions, though:<br>  <br>  1) Most practice open communion.  If you can come to the "table" with your heart in the right place, then you are welcome.  There aren't people there to check on you; it's an issue between you and God.<br>  <br>  2) Again most Methodists celebrate on the first Sunday of the month.  I do know of some that have a weekly communion service, however.  And on the other end of the spectrum, there may be some that rarely celebrate it at all.<br>  <br>  3) By taking the Eucharist, we enter into the story of the Christian faith.  It is an act of obedience and remembrance.  Obedience to the command that Christ laid before the disciples, and remembrance of the story of the Christian faith.<br>  <br>  Now, for the other stuff.<br>  <br>  a) Methodists do not believe in the actual presence of the body and blood of Christ, as the Roman Catholic church does (RCC belief is known as transubstantiation).  Methodist recognize the spiritual presence and the symbolism of the bread and juice, which falls more in line with a Zwinglian understanding of the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  b) You do not have to be a Methodist to take communion.<br>  <br>  c) Most Methodist church do use grape juice; the bread varies from church to church.  Some will use wafers, others crackers, others loaves of bread, and still others will use unleavened bread<br>  <br>  d) Again, it depends on the church you go to.  Some will have a communal cup and dip the bread in that cup (called intinction), others will have individual cups.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Well I'm a former Methodist<br>  <br>  It was pretty open and they did it once a month.  They just had me start one week when my parents decided I was ready.<br>  <br>  We were told that God was always present.  I don't know about the baptism thing since I was baptised, but it really wasn't like they checked.

lcvhhGjpaa	All are Electro-chemical reactions within the brain, all can be mapped scientifically.<br>  <br>  Try to keep up with things please, it's 2009.<br>  <br>  Edit: Cognitive memory attempts to integrate molecular, cellular, electrophysiological, and functional imaging data dealing with questions of encoding and retrieval of episodic memory. Ridderinkhof et al. (2004) review the literature and perform a meta-analysis of the role of the posterior medial frontal cortex in functions of cognitive control, such as monitoring of unfavorable outcomes, response errors, and response conflict. They suggest that the posterior medial frontal cortex is commonly activated when the need for performance adjustment becomes evident to the individual. Glimcher and Rustichini (2004) describe the latest developments in neuroeconomics, which tries to combine modern neurobiological techniques with well-established traditional approaches in economics and psychology. In a Viewpoint, Gelman and Gallistel (1978) discuss two papers in this issue of Science by Pica et al. (1987) and by Gordon (1999) on exciting new findings concerning the role of language in the origin of numerical concepts. They discuss these findings in the broader context originally proposed by Benjamin Lee Whorf (1956): how language not only influences but constrains the way we experience the world and even how we think.<br>  <br>  Miller (reveals how this field uses the remarkable diversity of the animal kingdom to understand the ways in which a brain controls behavior.

In current usage it typically denotes a criminal organization or else a criminal affiliation. In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance.<br>  <br>  The term gangster or mobster refers to a criminal who is a member of a crime organization, such as a gang. The terms are commonly used in reference to members of gangs associated with American prohibition and the American offshoot of the Italian Mafia, such as the Chicago Outfit or the Five Families. The related word "mobster" is a term derived from Latin and Aramaic. The word mobi means large gathering in Aramaic, and similarly, mob in Latin means crowd. In modern slang, the term "gangster" or "gangsta" is associated with being powerful, admirable or street smart.

mVTGl6HGaa	According to the U.S. Department of Justice, as of June 30, 2007, American prisons and jails held 2,299,116 inmates.[10] One in every 31 American adults, that's 7.3 million Americans, is in prison, on parole or probation. Approximately one in every 18 men in the United States is behind bars or being monitored. A significantly greater percentage of the American population is in some form of correctional control even though crime rates have declined by about 25 percent from 1988-2008.[11] 70% of prisoners in the United States are non-whites.[12] In recent decades the U.S. has experienced a surge in its prison population, quadrupling since 1980, partially as a result of mandated sentences that came about during the "war on drugs." Violent crime and property crime have declined since the early 1990s.[13]<br>  <br>  As of 2004, the three states with the lowest ratio of imprisoned to civilian population are Maine (148 per 100,000), Minnesota (171 per 100,000), and Rhode Island (175 per 100,000). The three states with the highest ratio are Louisiana (816 per 100,000), Texas (694 per 100,000), and Mississippi (669 per 100,000). [14]<br>  <br>  Nearly one million of those incarcerated in state and federal prisons, as well as local jails, are serving time for committing non-violent crimes. [15]<br>  <br>  In 2002, 93.2% of prisoners were male. About 10.4% of all black males in the United States between the ages of 25 and 29 were sentenced and in prison, compared to 2.4% of Hispanic males and 1.3% of white males. [16]<br>  <br>  In 2005, about 1 out of every 136 U.S. residents was incarcerated either in prison or jail.[17] The total amount being 2,320,359, with 1,446,269 in state and federal prisons and 747,529 in local jails.[18]<br>  <br>  A 2005 report estimated that 27% of federal prison inmates are noncitizens, convicted of crimes while in the country legally or illegally.[19] However, federal prison inmates are only a 6 percent of the total incarcerated population; noncitizen populations in state and local prisons are more difficult to establish.<br>  <br>  The United States has the highest documented per capita rate of incarceration of any country in the world.[3][5]

If it is Gigantopithecus, obviously it didn't go extinct.  Gigantos are thought to have gone extinct half a million years ago, not 10,000 years ago but it is difficult to know with limited fossil evidence when they went extinct (assuming they did).  Gigantopithecus is believed to be closely related to ancestors of orangutans and most paleontologists don't believe they are bipedal except those that believe in bigfoot.  It isn't likely it would evolve bipedalism in a convergent (parallel way).  It seems more likely to me it is descended from something closer to us such as one of the giant Homoerectus (had to mispell so it wouldn't delete), or H. heidelbergensis.   In any event, gigantos prove that it is viable for a hominoid to grow into a giant.|`|JKRgfXFXaa	I think the Roger Patterson video tape is proof for me, some people say its fake but if you look really close I have a hard time believeing it is a man in monkey suit because you can see the muscles under the skin moving as it walks and also the gait of its walk is not human.<br>  <br>  I believe that Sasquatch/Bigfoot is a real primate, an ice age great ape called 'Gigaintipithicus' which is thought to have gone extinct 10,000 years ago but most likely still exists in the shrinking pockets of unexplored wilderness that remain. There are probably about 2,000 of them in the North America alone in the Forrest's of the Pacific Northwest (Cali, Oregon, Wash, & B.C)along with being nocturnal which keep our encounters at a minimum they must have learned over the milenia's of cohabitation with us that their survival depends on their avoidance of man. <br>  <br>  Gorilla's the worlds largest known primate was only discovered 100 years ago before that it was thought to be a myth much like bigfoot and know we've driven them to the edge of extinction and keep them in cages for our entertainment...

2eztcCO0aa	It is natural.  There are gay animals.  In fact, recently there were a couple of Penguins at a zoo in New York, I think, who were gay and "adopted" an egg. <br>  <br>  In the animal kingdom, there is a role for gay members of a monkey troop or other animal community, so there's a survival advantage for the entire group to have gay members in it.<br>  <br>  There have always been gay people.  In some cultures it's not considered strange at all to be gay.<br>  <br>  There is more and more evidence that people who are gay have inborn traits that make them different.  If these traits are common in gay people but not in straight people, that makes it very possible that people are born gay.<br>  <br>  Having said that, there is a spectrum.  Some are totally straight, some totally gay, and a lot of people are in between.  We should all just let people love who they want, assuming they aren't abusing children or animals.  Why would we want to tell people they can't love who they want; why tell people that they have to be unhappy and lonely just because they don't love who we think they should?  That's just cruel.<br>  <br>  Okay, to answer your question partially:  I just read that many gay people have hair that whorls in a counterclockwise direction, while most straight people have hair that whorls the other way.  It's not a big thing, I know.  But it's just one of many things that make scientists think that these traits are linked to whatever trait makes people gay.|`|2ab909820942304668ac078e08751277aa	i think its natural to be true to yourself.<br>  if you happen to develop feelings for someone of the same sex, there is nothing wrong with that.|`|EwUcmfoFaa	No, its perfectly normal, we are all humans, just some of us fall in love with people of the same gender.

Stoner says that by using the modern science of probability in reference to eight prophecies, ‘we find that the chance that any man might have lived down to the present time and fulfilled all eight prophecies is 1 in 1017." That would be 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000. In order to help us comprehend this staggering probability, Stoner illustrates it by supposing that "we take 1017 silver dollars and lay them on the face of Texas. They will cover all of the state two feet deep. Now mark one of these silver dollars and stir the whole mass thoroughly, all over the state. Blindfold a man and tell him that he can travel as far as he wishes, but he must pick up one silver dollar and say that this is the right one. What chance would he have of getting the right one? Just the same chance that the prophets would have had of writing these eight prophecies and having them all come true in any one man."<br>  <br>  Stoner considers 48 prophecies and says, "we find the chance that any one man fulfilled all 48 prophecies to be 1 in 10157, or 1 in 10,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,... 000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,... 000,000,000."2<br>  <br>  The estimated number of electrons in the universe is around 1079.

Were those scientists there millions of years ago to document it? And don't give me "radiocarbon dating" BS. The dating methods used are always compared against the preconceived geologic column, which is purely arbitrary and made up about 200 years ago by an atheist lawyer - not a scientist!  The geologic column does not exist anywhere in the world except in a science textbook. If it did, it would be 100 miles thick. All dates acquired through either radioisotopes or carbon-14 dating must fit the preconceived geologic column, or else the dates are thrown out. Over half the dates they get, they throw out. Their dating methods are based on HUGE assumptions. They won't even carbon-date dinosaur bones. Why? Because carbon dating only works for things less than 50,000 years old, and they already have a preconceived BIAS that the dinosaurs died out "65 million years ago", so they refuse to carbon date them. But if they did, the dates would show them to be only a few thousand years old. They also have the problem of fresh dinosaur bones that still contain blood and marrow. Not possible if it's 65 million years old.<br>  Another problem is that carbon dating has been shown to produce false results for items of KNOWN age, but they are "assumed" to be correct for items of UNKNOWN age! Can you see how "evolution theory" is an IMPEDIMENT to intelligent scientific research? <br>  <br>  The Bible, on the other hand, has been around for thousands of years, has NEVER been proven wrong, and we find geological, biological and historical evidence all over the world that show that the Earth is young, there was a worldwide Flood, and life is intelligently designed. Also, the Bible tells us that the Earth will not be around another 10 million years. Christ is coming soon! Be ready, and stop wasting your time with "evolution". It's a load of bunk.|`|HGadAqG9aa	what are you talking about. the bible is scientifically accurate.<br>  A. The Sun<br>  <br>  In contrast to the Qur’an, the Bible teaches that the sun is actually on a circuit through space. Writing of the sun in Psalm 19:6, David said, “Its rising is from one end of heaven, and its circuit to the other end.” For many years critics scoffed at this verse, claiming that it taught that the sun revolves around the earth. Scientists at that time thought the sun was stationary. However, it has been discovered in recent years that the sun is in fact on a circuit through space, just like the Bible says.<br>  <br>  B. The Shape of the Earth<br>  <br>  When the rest of the world believed the earth was flat, Isaiah declared that the world was round… Isaiah 40:22 “It is He who sits above the circle of the earth." The Hebrew word there for circle [“chuwg”] literally means “sphere.” When did Isaiah write these words? Between 740 and 680 B.C. That was at least 300 years before Aristotle suggested, in his book On the Heavens, that the earth might be a sphere. Other verses are Proverbs 8:27 and Job 26:10. More than 2,000 years later some people still believed that Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) was going to sail off the edge of a flat planet in 1492!<br>  <br>  C. The Suspension of the Earth<br>  <br>  Before Isaac Newton discovered gravity Hindus believed that the earth rested on the back of an elephant who stood on the back of a turtle that was swimming in a great endless sea. The Greeks believed that the mythical god Atlas carried the earth on his shoulders. What did the Bible say? In one of the oldest books in the Bible, Job said in Job 26:7, “He [God] hangs the earth on nothing.” Scientists did not discover that the earth hangs on nothing until 1650.|`|7K3RcnNcaa	No.  Only a very small minority of us Christians are literal Fundamentalists.  <br>  <br>  The rest of us, the MAJORITY of thinking, rational, educated, Christians, do not see a contradiction between the metaphorical Biblical story of Creation and the scientific TRUTH.<br>  <br>  If you don't know that, you are as willfully blind as the Fundamentalists are.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	If the the bible is the so-called "infallible word of god" it should be 100% flawless, 100% unchanged and 100% unvarying (only one version).

Think of how hard it is to realize that your parents and grandparents, and those before them, were wrong.  <br>  No--it's easier to deny science than it is to face the truth of what they've been told to believe their whole lives.<br>  Marj, how do atheists lie?  And if you believe science doesn't lie, how on earth can you believe in your religion?  I mean, that's a cute phrase, but it makes no sense.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Because your "dating systems" are built on lies. <br>  <br>  "Carbon 14 dating" does not work, because the earth has not reached equilibrium in terms of carbon 14, so you'd need to know the age of the fossil, to know the age of the fossil.  That's obvious circular reasoning.   How much C14 was in it when it lived?  Nobody can say.  And then, has the rate of decay been constant?  Nobody can say that either.  They throw out half of all results they get back.  So how do you know if either half is right?  The reality is that both halves are wrong.  One experiment had a freshly killed seal, carbon dated as 1,400 years old.  When you date a sample that is of known age, it is always inaccurate.  Some system!  So C14 dating is worthless.<br>  <br>  The "geologic column" is also circular reasoning, the layers dated by the fossils and the fossils dated by the layers, disrupted by petrified trees that go through all the layers. <br>  <br>  The layers really came from the Flood, in reality.|`|118h96Q8aa	The Bible does not say that the earth is a thousand years old.

CEChcfKwaa	The Tuskegee incident was an example of the government's belief that Black people were expendable and showed their total lack of regard for our humanity. <br>  <br>  Unless you have a link to Alicia Keyes stating those beliefs I have to disregard that part of your question although there are some people (and not only Black people) who believe the government created HIV seeing as how it appeared out of nowhere and originally targeted the gay community (also considered expendable?) and then minorities. <br>  <br>  Some people also believe the government created crack cocaine because of it's highly addictive nature and it's affordability to poor minorities. If you recall, when it appeared was right about the time Black people had started unifying and gaining some political power in this country.<br>  <br>  We have all seen throughout history that governments are capable of secretly causing all kinds of atrocities, especially the USA, so you can't blame some people for wondering what else they may have done.

This being the case, Methuselah's lifespan has been a source of much speculation. Some resolve the issue by suggesting that Methuselah's long lifespan is not meant to be taken literally, while others attribute it to translation errors inflating a shorter lifespan.<br>  <br>  Notably, in the times of King David, when actual ages were recorded, the ages of the kings generally were in the range of 40-70 years old.<br>  <br>  If one assumes that the age of 969 indicates months (it says years in the bible) instead of years (indicating a mistranslation), Methuselah's age is calculated as 80.75 years which is a more realistic lifespan, but this requires that months be in the modern twelfths of a year. Another theory suggests lunar cycles were mistaken for the solar ones. If this is the case, each lifespan from Genesis would be shortened by a factor of 12.37 and give an age or 78 for Methuselah which resembles the lifespan of modern humans. However, objections to such life-shortening calculations have been raised on the grounds that, if reductions by these factors are carried out, several biblical fathers would have had children while they themselves were approximately five years old.[5]<br>  <br>  One solution involving translation error is proposed by Robert Best, who suggests that inaccurate conversion between various ancient Sumerian numerical systems produced the ages of Methuselah, Noah, and kin out of archaic Sumerian numerals. Best calculates that Methuselah's actual age would have been 85, and that he would have had his first son at age 17 (instead of age 187) When a thousand years was the limit for lifespan it would be like a 120 years now people have lived very close to the age just like methuselah. .[6]"<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah</a>|`|DS5rJQkwaa	Do you have any idea of the depth of your question?<br>  <br>  So I preface my answer in this way: <br>  <br>  It may get a little weird for some, and I use biblical text to support because it is the only popularly known text covering events and lore in a specific chronology that appears to have been deliberately preserved where other documents that may exist, have yet to be fully revealed in a way that might alter the current mainstream holdings on the origins of man/ persons.<br>  <br>  In other words, I am only drawing from what has been made easily available to almost all here, and subsequently assimilated by the majority of the masses. Other facts may be revealed at some later point proving what we do not know for certain now.<br>  <br>  My answer:<br>  <br>  Biblical text depicts the person-ality of GOD - YAHUWEH/ YHWH/ Jehovah / Allah predating all persons resulting from scriptural accounts of "the creation" credited to THE GOD. Old testament text depicts THE GOD saying to the effect about creation and the [stretching of the heavens and earth] "he was alone and there was no other with him".<br>  <br>  So The Person-ality of GOD is oldest, biblically speaking. <br>  <br>  Much later, it was asserted in New Testament text that Jesus the Christ had been with "The Father" from the beginning and that both are eternal. Eternal is about as old as a person-ality can get. Even if Jesus only became a living person 2000 years or so ago, 2000 + years old is pretty old. <br>  <br>  Biblical text in Genesis depicts Adam as GOD'S first created man/ person. Factually there is no Biblical text suggesting that Adam or Eve, (the first woman and second person) ever died. It is only written that they would die on a certain day if they engaged in certain forbidden behavior.<br>  <br>  If they are still alive, and they may well be, they would be the oldest post-creation persons according to biblical text. <br>  <br>  Then there is Methuselah, a person, who is depicted in biblical text to have lived 969 years. This is the longest life with a specific numerical accounting of years lived. <br>  <br>  Lastly, there is the talking serpent in the garden, later identified in the Revelatory text as The Dragon/ Satan/ The Devil, a person-ality that appears to have existed before the creation of Adam. <br>  <br>  Finally, who can say for sure if there are not older persons living on this planet or other planets that predate the commonly circulated records and texts we have here? Only those who know for sure could.<br>  <br>  If they do exist, for whatever reason, good or bad, thus far, they have chosen not to come forth conspicuously to all who inhabit this Earth and if this is the case, it is another issue entirely. <br>  <br>  That's enough for now!|`|8f1i9DWyaa	Methusalah.

FOzN3xwzaa	Catholicism can't get you or anyone into heaven at all.  That's why they have no guarantee to give you.  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works, that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  Yet the Bible says we are to KNOW that we are saved (1 John 5:13).  <br>  <br>  So who will you believe?  Believe JESUS. <br>  <br>  Believe in Jesus alone for salvation, and then you will KNOW right now that you will be in heaven.  You will be in heaven, no matter what!  :)   <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  We really do not know until we meet God / Jesus.

After all, He knew you before you  before you were born, knows everyday of your life and knows your future as well. So  who else would you trust your life too ? You are His child and He died for you. He was resurrected on the 3rd day and holds the keys to heaven and hell and it is to Him that we will all stand before, when judgment comes, for all authority on earth and in heaven has been given to Him. He is our King and our Judge as well as the author and perfector of our faith and if you want to see heaven, then start giving Him the Glory that is due to Him. Tell Him how you feel, praise Him for what he has done in your life and thank Him in every situation.

You can't have a god exist, if that god comes from nothing. It defies existence itself. <br>  <br>  Belief in a supernatural being who has 10 special laws for you, who sent down himself in the form of a human born of a virgin, who eventually got killed, rose from the dead and will return again, just seems more far fetched to me than "I don't know".|`|qp5EFetJaa	Okay, I have to get this out...

They contradict science, history, and even themselves frequently.<br>  <br>  Also, people who claim to believe a god exists don't seem able to say what a god is.  Generally, it is some kind of invisible sentient superbeing.  But they can't really get more definite than that.  So, until there is actually a concrete definition of what you're claiming to exist, there's really no need to refute it.  There's literally nothing to refute.<br>  <br>  People claim that they don't need evidence and they only rely on "faith", but they do so only because they have no evidence.  Note that even those who espouse faith seem to like to point out alll the dubious "miracles" and "prophecies" in their "holy" books.  They claim to not need evidence while pushing what they think is evidence.<br>  <br>  If you look at human psychology, you'll find that we are very prone to make up and strongly believe in myths, legends, superstitions, and urban legends.  Those have many characteristics in common.  And if you compare them to religion, you'll find the same basis, evolution, and structure.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but there is a lot of evidence that religion is just superstition.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Science has proved the Bible is wrong about many things.<br>  <br>  But you can't prove I don't own some beachfront property in Florida.

34CfVwbFaa	- Because you are being victimized by the world of "reverse discrimination" - which probably targets whites (and particularly white males) more than any other group.  This is (in my opinion) the result of decades of society preaching against discrimination against various minorities - (PARTICULARLY blacks) - which has now resulted in the ironic reality that it is now largely okay for members of "minorities" to make unfair or unreasonable criticisms against whites who make a statement with some regards or reference to "race" that they don't like.  It's kind of similar (again - my opinion) to the fact (no matter what anybody says to the contrary) that while many blacks often - and freely - use the infamous "N-word" - and get away with it - anyone white uttering the word in a public place could end up being beaten, charged with a 'race crime', or perhaps even killed - and no "authorities" may likely intervene. <br>  I myself have always believed that discrimination and 'racism' is wrong -but I believe the new dilemma I described above is also an unfair and improper result of trying to "correct" the problem.  "Reverse" discrimination is still called "discrimination"...|`|pvDVFrKwaa	people might mistake it as being racist because your calling it black and white music there is no such thing. there is hip hop, country, r&b, rock etc. there isnt white and there isnt black so that can come of racy just watch the way you work things that can offend people|`|7Nxw7jWFaa	You should of chosen your words more carefully.

Do read the Scriptures more thoroughly. Jesus increased the fish and loaves so that the people who had followed him (the 5000) wouldn't go hungry. It was a miracle that he did more than once. Jesus had been given power from his Father.<br>  <br>  Luke 9<br>  12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. <br>  <br>  13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people. <br>  <br>  14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. <br>  <br>  15 And they did so, and made them all sit down. <br>  <br>  16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. <br>  <br>  17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Man you need to go back and reread scripture because you are lost.

Jesus didn't turn bread into wine.<br>  <br>  As for the feeding of the 5,000, Jesus actually performed that miracle three distinct times.  He took a small amount of bread and fish and handed out enough to feed everyone, and then picked up baskets of crumbs.<br>  <br>  No, he did not hide food in the desert to accomplish this.  The best part of the story is after he feeds the multitudes for the THIRD time, the disciples notice the miracle and he asks them where they think all of the food came from the previous times.<br>  <br>  Get it?  They don't even notice the miracle that happens right under their noses, TWICE.<br>  <br>  I think life is a lot like that.|`|BlA60kDVaa	Wasn't this another way of saying he could feed the many within an egalitarian society?

However - Tut died unexpectedly at 19-20 years old.  A tomb was probably dug out and decorated during the embalming process.  Or the physical tomb was appropriated from another dead official and decorated for the King.<br>  <br>  So -- 2009 + 1324 = 3333 years ago.......|`|Ah458EfWaa	some time back in the year 1400 A.D. i think|`|eAx9wk1zaa	along time ago

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	There are people who can't take the infer red from sunlight, so direct sunlight hurts them.<br>  There are people with allergies so can only eat certain foods, which may seem too weird around others so they only eat at home just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  And there are people who think paranoid people who are willing to believe in horror stories and condemn others are uncomfortable to be around.|`|RrQNJsVsaa	No, vampires are not real.

V6bEFC6qaa	It does have to do with putting things "out of the way" as someone mentioned earlier. And I suppose that over time, the phrase "out of the way" blended and sounded as "away." It is probably a change in dialect and people heard it so often that it is in constant use. <br>  Otherwise, it may be a language thing. For example, in spanish, your face is " su cara" but when someone expresses that some feminine noun is expensive, they use " Es muy cara!" So "cara" in both cases, spelled same, but are used differently. I suppose this applies to "away." Hope I was helpful!|`|XMdG31HIaa	I think it's an expression adopted from the idea of putting things out of the way. That's my take.|`|b8168bb55990a4beab8a91471abee4efaa	when put into this reference the word "away" is the adverb for putting something in storage or safekeeping.|`|6866354d7549da6990e940de7aabecffaa	To keep them from getting in our ways!|`|uGcOxbwNaa	Well yes in a way they are because you are putting them somewhere where they are not in your way, like a closet or desk or wherever else you may stash stuff. So we are putting it "away" from us. Hope that helped

5qBFKtDiaa	Kalau mau bicara tentang "Bahasa Indonesia asli", pertanyaan pertama yang ditanya harusnya: Apa definisi "Bahasa Indonesia asli"?<br>  <br>  Bahasa Indonesia berawal dari bahasa Melayu yang asalnya dari Sumatra (sekitar Riau). Bahasa Melayu ini tersebar ke pulau2 lain karena berfungsi sebagai lingua franca untuk dagang selama ratusan tahun. Karena fungsinya ini, banyak pengguna bahasa ini yang bahasa utamanya bukan bahasa Indonesia, dan akhirnya bahasa Indonesia dalam penggunaannya tercampur2 dengan bahasa2 lain, seperti India, Arab, dll. Waktu zaman Belanda, bahasa Belanda juga terasimilasi ke dalam bahasa Indonesia. Ini bisa terlihat dari adanya kata2 seperti handuk ('tuala' dari 'towel' dalam Bahasa Malaysia), kamar ('bilik' dalam Bahasa Malaysia), persneling, retsleting, dll. Ada juga pengaruh2 dari bahasa Jawa dan bahasa2 lain.<br>  <br>  Baru saat Indonesia merdeka di 1945, bahasa lingua franca ini dijadikan bahasa Indonesia secara resmi. Sebelumnya, pemerintah Belanda juga memakai bahasa Melayu ini untuk administrasi. Alasannya hanya karena ada begitu banyak bahasa di kepulauan kita, dan ini adalah bahasa yang digunakan oleh paling banyak orang. Dan untuk memerintah ratusan suku dengan ratusan bahasa dan dialek sendiri, bahasa penyatu penting sekali. <br>  <br>  Tapi, bahasa Indonesia yang diresmikan itu bukan bahasa asli yang awalnya dipakai sebagai lingua franca. Malah, karena sudah sangat berbeda dari bentuk awalnya di Riau, bahasa resmi ini bukan bahasa yang dipakai oleh suku apapun di Indonesia. Kalau dilihat sejarahnya, memang "bahasa Indonesia asli" hanya dipakai di sekolah, administrasi pemerintah, dokumen2, dan fungsi2 formal lainnya. Sisanya, dalam keadaan informal, seluruh bangsa Indonesia memakai bahasa hybrid, entah itu Indonesia-Jawa, Indonesia-Sunda, atau Indonesia-Betawi yang biasa disebut bahasa gaul. "Bahasa Indonesia asli" tidak pernah populer sebagai bahasa lisan. Buktinya, seorang dosen bahasa Indonesia pun kalau dalam situasi informal bicara tidak bicara dengan bahasa Indonesia sesuai dengan segala peraturan bahasanya.<br>  <br>  Intinya, 'bahasa gaul' itu hanya salah satu bahasa hybrid yang dipakai di kepulauan Indonesia. Kalau memang mau mengkritik 'bahasa gaul', berarti seluruh bangsa Indonesia harus dikritik juga karena memakai bahasa hybrid. Dan bahasa hybrid ini selalu berubah mengikuti teknologi (kata 'komputer' atau 'hp' misalnya) bahasa lain terutama bahasa dominan seperti Inggris, dll. Ini sudah berlangsung sejak bangsa Indonesia belum eksis, dan menurut saya bahasa hybrid ini jauh lebih asli dari "bahasa Indonesia asli".|`|0526ac6ed0c2436f385019d50efb62ecaa	wahh itu ma ga bisa diketahui sampai kapan,, <br>  sampai semua orang indonesia ingin berbicara bahasa indonesia yg baik dan benar,,tp kayanya ga mungkin<br>  <br>  masalahnya bahasa indonesia yg baku itu ribet ga praktis,,<br>  tapi kita ga bakal kehilangan bahasa indonesia yg asli, soalnya kalo dikantor2 dalam dunia pekerjaan atau semacamnya kita masih memakai bahasa indonesia yg baku|`|Wq9oMTeOaa	Bahasa Indonesia asli ? apa yang dimaksud "asli" disini ? apakah "baku".

The recent (relatively recent, anyway) discovery of period specific Nordic cloak pins on the continent itself confirms this as the indigenous people of the region did  not travel to Europe.

I know that people do need to be given rules and so on but as a species we do have innate morals and a sense of fairness that means even without religion in society we would have some way of policing each other.

Not bad in itself. However, the most populated religions of today are not the best solution to the problems you have presented. How about a merciless emperor who enforces rules strictly? How about everyone who breaks the law is either killed or publicly whipped and beaten? That would certainly get 6 billion people to follow a certain sense of order. But what a cost. Same thing goes for religions like Christianity and Islam. There's a lot of good to their faiths at the core, but unfortunately we see what can happen to these systems: the inquisition, witch hunts, terrorism, holy wars, etc.<br>  <br>  You are right about one thing. The complete absence of religion may not be the best solution either. It is only the opposite extreme. This is why LaVey made sure to highlight in his writings some of the positive benefits of rituals and even dogma. There is no single solution that will work for all people. We're all different.

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	I'm going to ignore the part about abortion is OK because the babies go to heaven.  I think if you think about that for a moment,  or read some of the other poster's comments on that..you'll see how foolish that comment was. <br>  So anyways...<br>  <br>  Not irreparable?  OK genius,  try to UNKILL an aborted baby?  Try to make them alive again.<br>  <br>  Yah know what.. I'll lower the bar for you...<br>  <br>  If the harm done to a fetus is not irreparable, then try to put them back to gether and in one piece, when they are ripped apart by the vaccuum process most abortionists use.  IF you can even PUT the baby back in one piece,  THEN we'll resume negotations on whether or not the "harm" is irreparable or not.<br>  <br>  Until you can do that... I consider it PRETTY irreparable.<br>  __________________<br>  <br>  ::EDIT::<br>  <br>  The harm done is separate from where the soul ends up.  All actions which result in someone going to heaven does not MAKE the action good.  <br>  <br>  Using that logic, we would conclude that Killing ALL babies from here on out, would do the MOST good.  SURE the human race would END,  but the MOST percentage of people would go to heaven, ergo, our actions would be deemed "good"<br>  <br>  The infact going to heaven is NOT an infallible teaching. It is a Theological construct.. based on the understanding that God is merciful, and while the Baby is human, it has not committed any sins of its own freewill,  ergo, it would seem UNJUST to send such a soul to hell.  BUT,  it is a theological construct,  NOT known for sure.  It is NOT infallible teaching of the Catholic church NOR a unanimously taught principle amongst ALL Christians denominations.  - So you are taking liberties to ASSUME for SURE that the baby goes to heaven. <br>  <br>  Irregardless,  the baby Going to heaven is a RESULT of the fact that it was killed before it committed a sin of its own.  The person aborting it can not take credit for that.  <br>  Anotherwards we need to differentiate consequences and secondary consequences.  <br>  <br>  The Primary consequence of abortion is irreparable harm. The baby is killed, the abortion procedure is girzzily and horrific, Scientific evidence is NOW shedding light on the fact that the fetus most likely DOES feel pain.<br>  <br>  The Secondary consequence is that "theologically speaking" the baby "probably" goes to heaven. <br>  <br>  Catechism 2272 is not talking about the 2nd consequence but the 1st. <br>  <br>  Example:  A drunk driver hits my Car and totals it.  Insurance company pays me money for it (Primary Consequence) The fact that the Insurance agency pays me HIGH blue book for it AND includes a sum to pay for "mental anguish" even though I suffered no medical complications is a secondary consequence to me. The Drunk driver can NOT claim that his actions were GOOD, because I was paid extra by the insurance agency.|`|E71jweytaa	it is not known for sure that the fetus does go to heaven|`|FpeEJbhaaa	It's estimated that between 25-50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage or, as it's also called, spontaneous abortion.

This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: <br>  <br>  You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. <br>  <br>  God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. <br>   <br>  2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society.<br>  <br>  2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a "criminal" practice (GS 27 § 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. <br>  <br>  2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. <br>  <br>  Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."<br>  <br>  2399 The regulation of births represents one of the aspects of responsible fatherhood and motherhood. Legitimate intentions on the part of the spouses do not justify recourse to morally unacceptable means (for example, direct sterilization or contraception).<br>  <br>  Gen 1:28, 9:1,7; 35:11 - from the beginning, the Lord commands us to be fruitful ("fertile") and multiply. A husband and wife fulfill God's plan for marriage in the bringing forth of new life, for God is life itself.<br>  <br>  Gen. 28:3 - Isaac's prayer over Jacob shows that fertility and procreation are considered blessings from God. <br>  <br>  Gen. 38:8-10 - Onan is killed by God for practicing contraception (in this case, withdrawal) and spilling his semen on the ground. <br>  <br>  Gen. 38:11-26 - Judah, like Onan, also rejected God's command to keep up the family lineage, but he was not killed. <br>  <br>  Deut. 25:7-10 - the penalty for refusing to keep up a family lineage is not death, like Onan received. Onan was killed for wasting seed. <br>  <br>  Gen. 38:9 - also, the author's usage of the graphic word "seed," which is very uncharacteristic for Hebrew writing, further highlights the reason for Onan's death. <br>  <br>  Exodus 23:25-26; Deut. 7:13-14 - God promises blessings which include no miscarriages or barrenness. Children are blessings from God, and married couples must always be open to God's plan for new life with every act of marital intimacy. <br>  <br>  Lev.18:22-23;20:13 - wasting seed with non-generative sexual acts warrants death. Many Protestant churches, which have all strayed from the Catholic Church, reject this fundamental truth (few Protestants and Catholics realize that contraception was condemned by all of Christianity - and other religions - until the Anglican church permitted it in certain cases at the Lambeth conference in 1930. This opened the floodgates of error). <br>  <br>  Lev. 21:17,20 - crushed testicles are called a defect and a blemish before God. God reveals that deliberate sterilization and any other methods which prevent conception are intrinsically evil. <br>  <br>  Deut. 23:1 - whoever has crushed testicles or is castrated cannot enter the assembly. Contraception is objectively sinful and contrary, not only to God's Revelation, but the moral and natural law. <br>  <br>  Deut. 25:11-12 - there is punishment for potential damage to the testicles, for such damage puts new life at risk. It, of course, follows that vasectomies, which are done with willful consent, are gravely contrary to the natural law. <br>  <br>  1 Chron. 25:5 - God exalts His people by blessing them with many children. When married couples contracept, they are declaring "not your will God, but my will be done." <br>  <br>  Psalm 127:3-5 - children are a gift of favor from God and blessed is a full quiver. Married couples must always be open to God's precious gift of life. Contraception, which shows a disregard for human life, has lead to t|`|B6r56Nr7aa	Only Divine may create or destroy mortal life.|`|entRyNolaa	It does damage to the parents, and the entire universe. end of story.<br>  <br>  If you had a child and decided not to let her read books, or socialize with others ...ever. <br>  Abortion is like that, but worse.|`|QUg9W2NGaa	Is not for humans to decide whether  somebody lives or die.|`|FV7SkAcIaa	Here let me give it to you in graphic form|`|GH48p1Loaa	Using the same logic, why not kill any 2-,3-,4-year-olds we don't want, won't they go straight to heaven as well?<br>  <br>  Edit: the church believes a "fetus" to be a baby, does it not? why else would they label it irreparable harm if they did not consider it to be a child? Here is why I believe this way too: <br>  There are four differences between an unborn child and a 6 month old, and only four. 1. Size. Do you think that being larger makes one more human than a smaller human? 2. Level of Development. Fetuses are less developed than a 6 month old, just as 6 month olds are less developed than a teenager. The child is not less human. 3. Environment. The location of a child does not determine its humanity. and lastly, 4. Degree of Dependancy. Of course fetuses are completely dependant on the mother. 6 month olds are also mostly, if not completely, dependant on others for survival.
AA10554783	One day, the Buddha sat down in the shade of a tree and noticed how beautiful the countryside was. Flowers were blooming and trees were putting on bright new leaves, but among all this beauty, he saw much unhappiness. A farmer beat his ox in the field. A bird pecked at an earthworm, and then an eagle swooped down on the bird. Deeply troubled, he asked, "Why does the farmer beat his ox? Why must one creature eat another to live?" <br>  <br>  During his enlightenment, the Buddha found the answer to these questions. He discovered three great truths. He explained these truths in a simple way so that everyone could understand them. <br>  <br>  1. Nothing is lost in the universe <br>  <br>  The first truth is that nothing is lost in the universe. Matter turns into energy, energy turns into matter. A dead leaf turns into soil. A seed sprouts and becomes a new plant. Old solar systems disintegrate and turn into cosmic rays. We are born of our parents, our children are born of us. <br>  <br>  We are the same as plants, as trees, as other people, as the rain that falls. We consist of that which is around us, we are the same as everything. If we destroy something around us, we destroy ourselves. If we cheat another, we cheat ourselves. Understanding this truth, the Buddha and his disciples never killed any animal. <br>  <br>  2. Everything Changes <br>  <br>  The second universal truth of the Buddha is that everything is continuously changing. Life is like a river flowing on and on, ever-changing. Sometimes it flows slowly and sometimes swiftly. It is smooth and gentle in some places, but later on snags and rocks crop up out of nowhere. As soon as we think we are safe, something unexpected happens. <br>  <br>  Once dinosaurs, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers roamed this earth. They all died out, yet this was not the end of life. Other life forms like smaller mammals appeared, and eventually humans, too. Now we can even see the Earth from space and understand the changes that have taken place on this planet. Our ideas about life also change. People once believed that the world was flat, but now we know that it is round. <br>  <br>  3. Law of Cause and Effect <br>  <br>  The third universal truth explained by the Buddha is that there is continuous changes due to the law of cause and effect. This is the same law of cause and effect found in every modern science textbook. In this way, science and Buddhism are alike. <br>  <br>  The law of cause and effect is known as karma. Nothing ever happens to us unless we deserves it. We receive exactly what we earn, whether it is good or bad. We are the way we are now due to the things we have done in the past. Our thoughts and actions determine the kind of life we can have. If we do good things, in the future good things will happen to us. If we do bad things, in the future bad things will happen to us. Every moment we create new karma by what we say, do, and think. If we understand this, we do not need to fear karma. It becomes our friend. It teaches us to create a bright future. <br>  The Buddha said, <br>  <br>  "The kind of seed sown <br>   will produce that kind of fruit. <br>   Those who do good will reap good results. <br>   Those who do evil will reap evil results. <br>   If you carefully plant a good seed, <br>   You will joyfully gather good fruit." <br>                                      Dhammapada|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Because extreme opinions and methods are usually not the best approach.

When he was young, he was rich and spoiled by his father who wanted him to become a great ruler.  Then he became a wandering ascetic "seeker" after spiritual truth.  Neither of these paths of excess worked.  The former he found to be useless and degrading, and the second he found to be painful and degrading.  He achieved liberation from suffering after he gave up austere practices and looked after himself more.  The same applies to Buddhist practice to this day - it is based on not merely following your every impulse, but not denying that they exist and thinking that you are wicked for wanting pleasure.

The Lord said, I have seen the grey oppression upon the hairs of thy head. Thou shalt bestow color upon them, with all my wonders I have given the Earth. Also hath I seen the clothes which fiteth thee ill. Thou shalt travel to the land of Macys and speak to the Queen of Makeover.  <br>  <br>  Then saith the Lord, I know thy sorrows and I will send unto thee a man who shall be thy friend, and he shall say unto you, I AM hath sent me. Thus shalt I deliver thy both unto the land flowing with Olive Garden, and unto the place of the Applebees, and unto the Picture Theater of the Lord.

You can never predict what they are going to do.  If they deliver a message to you from the SUPREME BEING, will you understand it?  Or, are they just messin with you?  And will they wrestle with you?   I'd hate to get one of them angry.  But if I did get one of them to deliver a message to my brother I would have him say this:<br>  <br>  "Be of good spirit and forget about who won the election.  Did you think it would matter?  And quit being such a bigot!  You wanna see some lightening bolts?  Then behave yourself, be a good sport and quit being so negative!  Haven't we always taken good care of you?  Didn't you catch that nice 42 pound salmon after only one little prayer?  You got a lot on the line here - hope to see you at the pearly gates eventually, but you gonna need an attitude change."
AA10246871	I guess my question is: Do we really want to?<br>  <br>  It's a strange story, but I have heard others equally strange. I read someplace that approximately 50% of couples in Ireland prior to 1995 were living in sin, because they could not get divorced. Young people get curious about sex and have sex outside of marriage (sin), but don't use birth control (sin). Then the girl gets pregnant at a young age, but they have to get married because the baby is considered illegitimate if they aren't married by the time it's born (sin). So they marry very young, and may not even love each other. (I consider that a grievous error in judgment, if not a full-blown sin, but the Catholic Church feels differently on the topic.). Discontent grows in the young couple, often leading to abuse in the relationship (sin), as well as one or both parties hitting the pubs a bit too hard. (I'd rather see them hit the pubs than one another, but I don't get to decide who does what.) Finally, after they have gained a bit more maturity, they both find someone else who they would have preferred to marry (generally already married and playing out the same drama in his or her own home). Since they cannot get a divorce, they simply move in together, often with the woman adopting the new man's last name, and live as if married, though they are not (sin). Among the older generation, the new laws allowing divorce seem a waste of time and money, so they often choose to keep things as they are, which is, naturally, a sin. It's just a sin-a-thon!<br>  <br>  A quick rundown of the 10 Commandments shows me I sinned greatly, and that was just yesterday! I guess that gets me off the hook from having to go out back in the snow and dig around for rocks suitable for stoning.<br>  <br>  Thank goodness God is merciful, and sins can be forgiven. <br>  <br>  My only true hope is that they are both happy now, and leading the lives they wish to lead.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	If both of them agreed with the sex change operation, then  only the last one, the divorce that I consider a sin.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	Sounds like they need deliverance ministry help!!!  and a new therapist!!!!|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Only St. Jerry of Springer could sort this out.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	I don't think it's as complicated as you make it out to be.<br>  Catholics believe that sex outside of the sacrament of marriage is a sin.  I don't know that it makes any difference whether it is homosexual or heterosexual.  <br>  Since these two never got married in the church, all of their sexual relationship was sin.  The surgeries make no difference.  (I actually attended a Catholic church where the administrator was transgender.  That didn't matter to anyone).    And since they were never really married, the divorce isn't anything.|`|AA12140229	since the bible didn't have to consider the trans gender situation, as far as i can tell the only sin would have been committed AFTER the divorce since the church doesn't acknowledge divorce without some sort of dispensation from the church. i'm not sure about being married in the church, but as long as the ceremony had the words ' in the eyes of God' somewhere in it i think it counts. <br>  <br>  i'm not catholic so i feel free to have a pretty liberal view of what sin is. to my mind sin starts with your own conscience. i see no place for conscience in the above story. not my thing but i'm no judge. the only judgement i feel comfortable making here is that neither one of them took their catholicism very seriously.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	For Catholics, the not being married in a Church is not a sin...<br>  <br>  No idea what the rules on homosexuality for Catholics are other than that they are clearly opposed to it...<br>  <br>  Divorce would be a Sin for Catholics. You need to get it Annuled (I'm guessing 'He' now being a 'She' and 'She' being a 'He' would definately be grounds to have your marriage annuled).|`|piBBg34kaa	That's my problem with the Catholic Church , everthing is a sin.  Now the transgender stuff would be sinning because that is the way God created and he always gets it right.  The Homosexuality is also a sin.  But sin can be forgiven.|`|79f5a220cbaeaee23f7053e20846799faa	And (((8TM))) thought his dangit suburban life was sinful and complicated!!!  lol<br>  <br>  .|`|JdYVmsNaaa	The Church answer: <br>  <br>  A marriage outside the Church without dispensation from a bishop is a mortal sin. They were doomed from that moment. As for the rest-- down the hole is down the hole.

LOL). After much research, pondering, and complex theorizing, we developed a new and revolutionary philosophical position which we like to call, " Гμ?≤ Sin! ".<br>  <br>  And that's what I would recommend for this couple, as well. :-)

Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with himself.  <br>  Rom 8:34   Who then will condemn us? Will Christ Jesus? No, for he is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting at the place of highest honor next to God, pleading for us.  <br>  Rom 8:35   Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love?

Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away.  <br>  Rom 8:39   Whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.

The obvious import of Jesus' words is that those who do not obey Jesus' directions do not belong to him.<br>  <br>  While Jesus' yoke is easy and his burden is light (Matt 11:30), there is work to be done by Christians.  The main work is acts of charity, described in Matt 25:  Feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, tending the sick.  These are not just suggestions, but requirements in obedience for salvation.<br>  <br>  Those who reject these works cannot rightfully claim Jesus as Lord, and he will not claim them as his own. Rather, he will say, "'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."<br>  <br>  Those who teach a false gospel of faith alone are misleading themselves and others about God's expectations for his people.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	If you read the whole text instead of just tearing out a single line, you'll see that Jesus is speaking with someone who called him "Lord", but Jesus knew he didn't actually believe He was.

That comes from Deut. 11:27; 13:4; 27:10; and 30:8.

I need to make some huge changes. Still, I'm confused about the balance between obedience and relying on faith. I believe God will help me work it out and help me serve Him soon. Too many people are hurting and in need of the Gospel for me to be sitting on Yahoo Answers. Thank you.|`|hWvvrEphaa	Nah, it doesn't bother me. I know what it means and its exactly what I try to tell everyone. People labeling themselves Christians, meanwhile calling atheists stupid and idiots. I've even heard some 'christians' curse on non-christians. That is not a christian. <br>  <br>  I believe what Jesus means is -why do you call me your lord if you're doing the opposite of what I want you to do?-<br>  <br>  :)|`|OAjN34M4aa	He was referring to the hypocrisy of people who pretend to follow Him but do not obey His commandments or adhere to His teachings. Such people bother me very much, but the words of my Lord do not. We all fail sometimes, though.<br>  <br>  Jarhead: thank you for that last sentence you wrote. That is an awkward truth many fair-weather Christians ignore.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	Well, It makes me think. That's why it trips me out how atheist will say "Well that doesn't sound to Christ like" When They have no idea how completely real and blunt he is. He doesn't dumb things down, he tells it as it is.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	I've never met a single person that quoted this, that didn't assume that they themselves were not being referred to.  They always assume it refers to everyone else. <br>  <br>  Funny how that is.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	I feel a sense of guilt so I try to obey Him as much as I can.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO, why. Are you claiming that you are the only one that does what Jesus says. Well then you are in worse shape than we could possibly be. I might sound great to say the following but read the whole thing and see how it ends !!<br>  <br>  Luke 18:11<br>  The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, 'O God, I thank you that I'm not like other people-thieves, dishonest people, adulterers, or even this tax collector.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	No it does not trouble me.  It encourages me that our perfect Lord and Savior was aware that we will fall short of His teachings and loves and forgives us anyway.  He then goes on to explain himself and show us how to be better.

8ud8Y3CRaa	Because of upbringing. If you had a father who was not in your life and left the mother for no reasons, or seen your mother abused, or see how others treat women in general....you tend to follow and they bring that into their music. Now this is music wise, other races of men degrade women, but not in music most of the time. Also the mess sells....because of the tunes/beat not what their saying.|`|PrkW6YV4aa	I guess you've never heard of Anthony Hamilton, Luther Vandross, Teddy Pendergrass, Al Green, Jaheim, Mario, Omarion, Usher, Aaron Hall, Teddy Riley...I could go on and on, but none of those guys sing or rap about disrespecting women or doing drugs.|`|GInSlNYcaa	Maybe you should try listening to different types of rap music, like Christian rap. I seriously doubt they disrespect women or sell drugs.|`|89lAhznQaa	to finish their rhymes i guess, they always talk about either that, or firearms, or money, i think it's becoming repetitive.|`|qSqs7PoCaa	lol what the heck, what kind of retarded question is that?<br>  <br>  I'm with Zellparis and jsg.

If they talk about selling drugs, it probably because they lived through it, so they rap about their lives. Im tired of people blaming rap for violence and promoting other bad things. <br>  <br>  80% of the movies are worse than any song ever made. You have movies that show people getting killed, raped, and other crazy things. There's rock songs out there that talk about satanic worship, or about committing suicide.|`|bnjjeBLYaa	Most black men don't rap. Some do, but it's not like every black man is a rapper. A lot of people from other ethnicities rap, too, by the way.<br>  <br>  Not all rap is about the same thing.<br>  <br>  For rap that is about those things, it's an easy thing to rap about because others have done it so it's safe. Rappers like that just are too nervous of being rejected to try anything new.<br>  <br>  Listen to a wide variety of rap and you'll see it's about many different things. Rap, like any type of music, can be about anything. It's just a style.|`|JGGbQhCaaa	Most African American men do nothing of the sort!<br>  Most African American men are self-respecting and hold African American women in the highest regard.<br>  Most African American men would like these raps to disappear.<br>  <br>  The extremely small number of African American boys of which you speak are fame and fortune desperate and dance to the dictates of the obscene bosses of the industry who demand obscenities, vulgarities and anit-Black expressions for the sick markets they serve.

Yes, we talk about the problems that face the black community.  All the time.  How to overcome them, and what to do about it.  Many of us actually are involved in community work to solve it.  Maybe if you are truly concerned, go get up and do something about it.|`|DeuKCARsaa	they are not...<br>  <br>  only when people (you) pretend these problems ONLY exist in Minority (black) communities are they labeled irrational (keish)|`|Ps9eOIchaa	You're not a sellout for discussing problems within the community.Open communication about such topics can help to improve the community and give a better name for yourselves.But there is a way to come about it.Acting ignorant,racist,stereotypical,generalizi... rude and acting as though you have no fault is why someone would be called a sellout.|`|H0SeSesWaa	I know. I so get you. I grew up in an interracial family; my mother is African-American and my father is Italian. My mother is constantly called a seel out,just for marrying my dad. But the minute she discusses her issues with black men and the black community, she gets shut down. I myself am called a sell out just for being intellegent and not speaking slang and dressing a certain way. Its rediculous.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Because "ignants" cant handle the truth. It diggs into their souls and consciences like a rusted knife.<br>  <br>  Statistics also hurt the "ignants". Rather than try to beat the odds and stereotypes, it makes them angry and perpetuate them even moreso.<br>  <br>  By "ignants" I'm referring to the true sell outs of the culture.

AA11232725	It isn't so much that God blames us for inheriting a sinful or as you call it rightly a "human" nature as much as He commands us to recognize our fallen state and repent or turn from it and trust in the salvation that He has provide through the Lord Jesus.<br>  <br>  Now if all He did was command us without making provision we would be unable to comply. But He gives his Holy Spirit to those who ask Him and the Spirit of God makes them a "new creation" on the inside and starts to work of sanctification. That's why it's called being "born again" or being "born from above".<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,  10  nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.  11  And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.<br>  <br>  "And such WERE some of you". The Apostle Paul loved the people whom he preached the gospel to. He knew that he himself was the worst of sinners before he got saved and he went around and told people of God's power to live transformed lives in Christ.<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 1:12  And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,  13  although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.  14  And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.  <br>  <br>  15  This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.  16  However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I know it does not make sense at all!  <br>  <br>  Esther are you choosing sin as well then?|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	That's why christianity is a war on natural instinct.  Sin is a man made thing.|`|AA11987172	Reminds me of the mob tactic, "creating a problem and then solving it."|`|ulwXFrrJaa	I did not chose to get stuck in a question and answer cite with Esther.  But my brain is still punished for it.|`|ZOsdAyrjaa	Your example of lust isn't REALLY lust... trust me, there's a BIG difference between noticing someone's attractive and lusting after them... lust always craves the forbidden, never being able to be satisfied. I've fought it enough to know that. Ever since the beginning, we have ALWAYS chosen to sin, regardless of what we'd like to do. There's only one man who hasn't: Jesus Christ. It says in Hebrew that He is our high priest who has been tempted in every way we are, yet was without sin.<br>  <br>  I'm not claiming to understand WHY things are the way they are, but I can accept it, because there's a way out... You'd think people would be jumping on the opportunity, but they don't because it's "just not fair." To quote the popular saying, "life isn't fair," and anyways, who are you to judge what's fair?? To say His rules aren't fair is like a young child saying that their parents' rule that they can't run out into the street isn't fair. All they're asking is that you don't play in the street; the rest of the yard, the woods and streams, and even inside the house is fair game. God has certain things you can't do, but otherwise there's a world of things you CAN do... He tells you to not play near the edge of the cliff and not to drink poison, even one little drop... but there's rivers, mountains, caves, meadows, and plenty of other things to do! Why focus on what we can't do when we've got lots of stuff we CAN do?? All He asks is to do what He says and always act in love, after acknowledging we can't do it on our own, and we NOT ONLY get saved from eternally hungry flames, we get to hang out in a place He made just for us!! All that's required is submission and obedience... I'll take His way over whining and complaining over what we can't change ANY day!|`|JREs9K0Gaa	God wants a response from us regarding our sins.  We have to ask God for forgiveness.  It's not an automatic process.  To not be charged in the first place wouldn't matter much if you just continue to sin.  You have to want to change.  God doesn't force us to change otherwise he'd be taking away our freedom of choice.|`|VLxU5112aa	Religion is supposed to be about love, and understanding, and forgiving, or so the preachers tell us.  Yet when you read the Bible, you see very little of that.  Yes there are morals told, yes there are fabulous stories to convey messages to people, yet if God was so benevolent he wouldn't kill everyone who wasn't as perfect as his own son.<br>  <br>  If God created man in his image, does that mean that God is a sinner?  Does that mean God is naturally sinful, or chooses to sin?  Does he like evil?  If so, why worship him?  Why expect him, of all people, to absolve you of your sins?  These are really some questions I'd like theists to consider.|`|casg30Ataa	Apparently, its because he loves us.<br>  <br>  Kind of like how I love my dog so much that whenever he acts like a dog i beat him to a bloody pulp.|`|macZI2dzaa	Sin became our nature when our 'representatives', Adam and Eve sinned.  The idea is that if the best that there could be represented us, then we too would have chosen to sin.  Don't fret no one receives the wages of death for Adam's sin, we get death the old fashioned way, we earn it.  <br>  The original sin idea is kind of like your political representatives voted now over 3 trillion dollars in bailouts of mostly people that made exceptionally poor decisions.  Not just you but your children and grandchildren will pay the price of that bailout, even though they may not yet be born.  Nasty ain't it?<br>  Oh, and God has paid our 'bailout', Jesus died so you do not have to. <br>  As a holy and perfectly just God He must charge the offense.  Justice must be served.
g4nlUfmeaa	If Heaven did exist (I'm not inclined to think it does), then as long as the souls that ascended to Heaven retain their memories of life, they would have sufficient frame of reference to understand and appreciate their lack of suffering.<br>  <br>  Besides, who says that pain and happiness are two sides of the same coin, and that they can't exist independently of each other?  Can you actually prove that, either with evidence or through an exercise of pure logic?<br>  <br>  Do you need oak trees to understand elephants?  Do you need to be gifted with sight to be able to hear things?  Do you to have experienced loneliness to enjoy another person's company?  Do you need to have experienced bitter taste to enjoy something sweet?  I don't think so.  Knowledge of pain and suffering may give added dimension to the experience of being happy (and vice versa) but that doesn't mean that you absolutely cannot experience one without the other.|`|e4yczpKsaa	The whole point of the aspect of Heaven is something not attached to human standards...something that humans aren't apart of in the world of mortals...in this case, pain.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Well I'm willing to live in perfect harmony.

Hell is for those who haven't.<br>  <br>  There can be a short without long.  Because we have seen long.<br>  There can be a small without large.  Because we have seen large.<br>  There can be happiness without pain.  Because we have experienced the pains of life.<br>  <br>  A closed-minded atheist is what you are.

hZjPYyFTaa	He is an amazing, clever interesting guy and a great biologist. But he violates a standard principle of academic debate – he knows too little about what he is attacking. He has simply not bothered to familiarise himself with the vast literature on philosophy of religion and science and religion. <br>  He has not taken on the most sophisticated representatives of the religious viewpoint. Instead, he chooses a few easy targets and scores cheap points. He persists with a quaint and erroneous nineteenth-century view of the relation between science and religion or  ‘the conflict myth’.<br>  His own na?ve and plodding counter-arguments would make a first year theological student blush.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to the blunders he's made:<br>  <a href="http://www.arn.org/docs/williams/pw_goddelusionreview2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.arn.org/docs/williams/pw_godd...</a>|`|knOdcrDkaa	Never met the man.

Contention leads nowhere but to confusion and animosity. Contention, in any good form, is unChristlike.

jYwSKzg1aa	I think it's in their definition of "neighbor".  Since many christians would call a gay atheist an abomination or some other equally unkind term, they feel released from the requirement to treat you as a neighbor.|`|gf3CCvuUaa	Cuz Christians are still human being. They are prone to hate others who are different from themselves. I'm sure atheists do the same sometimes, and whether you're gay or straight doesn't make any different.

It also doesn't seem to include other Christians of a different sect.<br>  <br>  I don't know how they justify it, but as an outsider it seems very hypocritical to me, and not what Christianity is supposed to be about.<br>  <br>  It could be something to do with what they consider as "sin", and those who are not willing to repent their "sins" are not welcome within the fold.<br>  <br>  The bigotry in some quarters is one of the reasons I am not overly impressed with current day Christianity.|`|macZI2dzaa	Jesus said, "Love your enemies."  The only religion that calls its adherents to love their enemies is Christianity.  The fact that many Christians deny the main principle of Jesus is dreadful.  <br>  Anyone can love their neighbor, or someone who loves them, but a Christian is commanded to love even an enemy.  Sorry you have not seen love from those who claim loyalty to it.<br>  Oh, but you do not care about love, your faith is that love is merely a chemical reaction that is determined based on genetics and environment, because you believe in a totally mechanical universe.

He made all of us intelligent enough to recognize truth - you just fail to acknowledge it.<br>  <br>  Romans 1:19-22<br>  what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, 21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  He did not give out free will JUST so he could send us to hell. He made hell for the angels who rebelled. But since some of his children still choose to reject him, he can't accept them either, because they don't want to be accepted. This world will soon be no more. That leaves heaven and hell. If people choose NOT to go to heaven, they, by default, choose hell.<br>  <br>  God gave us free will because he wanted us to CHOOSE to love him. If you chain your spouse to the wall in your basement and he/she tells you they love you, would you believe them? No! You're not giving them a choice, so they will resent it. God understands this even better yet.<br>  <br>  Or take this example: If you live in a crumby apartment, and the landlord is going to be tearing it down, but he offers for you to live in a huge mansion with everything your heart desires - for free - would you take it? Or would you choose instead to live on the streets?|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Romans 1 says that the Lord did make it obvious. <br>  <br>  We choose to ignore it, because of our love of sin and hate for the truth. <br>  <br>  But you can believe in Jesus at any moment, and be saved. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

I think Plato for example (not sure).<br>  <br>  But that doesn't change anything at all.<br>  <br>   What is 'belief' . St Thomas Aquinas gives a classic answer :<br>  Credere voluntatis est, to believe depends upon the free will, says St. Thomas (Summa Theologica Part II-II:Question 10: Article 8)<br>  <br>  Your problem is with the nature of belief and not with any inclination one way or the other. Pascal pointed this out centuries ago :<br>        “In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows for those who don't.”<br>  <br>  It is the nature of the WILL that decides :<br>  ================================<br>  “Man can be compelled to do a good many things. There are a good many other things he can do in a halfhearted fashion, as it were, against his will. But belief can never be halfhearted. One can believe only if one wishes to. Perhap the credibility of a given person will be revealed to me so persuasively that I cannot help but think: It is wrong not to believe him; I “must” believe him. But this last step can be taken only in complete freedom, and that means that it can also not be taken. There may be plenty of compelling arguments for a man’s cedibility; but no argument can force us to believe him.<br>  <br>  The unanimity of statements on this point is astonishing; and the agreement ranges all the way from Augustine and Thomas to Kierkegaard, Newman and Andre Gide. Augustine’s phrase from the Commentary on John is famous; “Nemo credit nisi volens”: No one believes except of his own free will. Kierkegaard says that one man can do much for another, “but give him belief, he cannot”. Newman is forever stressing, in one guise or another, the one idea that belief is something other than the result of a logical process; it is precisely not “a conclusion from premises”. “For directly you have a conviction that you ought to believe, reason has done its part, and what is wanted for faith is, not proof, but will.” And Andre Gide? In the last jottings he published after his Journals we may read these sentences: “There is more light in Christ’s words than in any other human word. This is not enough, it seems, to be a Christian: in addition, one must believe. Well, I do not believe.” Taken all together, these statements obviously mean the following: It is one thing to regard what someone else has said as interesting, clever, important, magnificent, the product of genius or absolutely “true”. We may feel compelled to to think and say any and all these things in utter sincerity. But it is quite a different matter to accept precisely the same statements in the way of belief. In order for this other matter, belief, to come about, a further step is necessary. A free assent of will must be performed. Belief rests upon volition” (Josef Pieper, Faith, Hope, Love, p 35-36).|`|aJLXBhoAaa	Because God didn't want us to be a bunch of mindless robots.

Abortions are being performed primarily to end unwanted pregnancies - largely by teens afraid to admit to their religious parents that they are having sex.<br>  <br>  It is the lack of sex education, and the reactionary attitudes of religious groups and parents towards teens that do have sexual relations that are the primary cause of abortions.  Attitudes that positions such as Bush's promote.  This is borne out by the fact that with higher education, and amongst atheists, the rates of teen pregnancy and abortion are much, much lower than they are amongst those who profess to being devout Christians.<br>  <br>  If the feotuses are being aborted anyways, tragic as that circumstance is, would it not be better to use those cells to advance medical knowledge, rather than simply disposing of them in a dumpster behind the clinic?<br>  <br>  Perhaps if more stem cell research is conducted, techniques can be developed which permit the usage of undifferentiated epithelial cells such as those lining the peritineum or buccal cavity - then there wouldn't even be the need for fetal cell collection at all.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Please post questions like this in politics.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, absolutes are always a problem and this is no exception.

I'll repeat that....No embryos are created just to be used in stem-cell research.  When couples go to fertility clinics, they created embryos from the couple's sperm and egg cells.  There are always more created initially because of the issue of viability.  If the embryo implanted takes hold, fine.  But sometimes the first embryo or even the second one does not take hold...that's why they created more than one.  Those embryos that are created but not used belong to the individual couple.  It is up to them whether those embryos are kept or destroyed.  It is the embryos that would have been destroyed that are used for stem-cell research.  I'll repeat that.....it is the embryos that would have been destroyed that are used for stem-cell research.

Right religion, as it would state in James, is to attend to widows and orphans in their needs (James 1).  Basically, widows need godly young men to come along sometimes and help out chores around the house that they cannot take care of themselves.  A young widow may need help from the church to pay bills if her husband was not a good steward of finances, or to watch the kids while she finds work to support her and her children.  Orphans need godly men and women to poor wisdom and instruction into their lives.  They need help with many things that they do not have parents to provide.  Additionally, in Matthew, Jesus says that those who call themselves believers but didn't: visit the sick, visit prisoners, feed the hungry, clothe the poor, etc would be separated and cast into the fire.<br>  <br>  As you can see, these are things not so much considered Christianity or Organized Religion anymore, but just what people are supposed to do.  So people aren't tired of Organized Religion, but bad religion and worthless religion.  The places that still teach and truly practice these things continue to grow.

VSWl45cKaa	For the the first pair, the second sounds better but you forgot the word 'mais' . Also 'now' is better expressed 'en ce moment" to denote 'at the present time' or 'now' . I think you want to say .....but I will do it the next time you reply (presumably to an e-mail?). If so, it should read:   "......mais je le ferai à la prochaine fois que tu réponds." (you had the incorredct form of 'tu réponds'). Assembled together it becomes:<br>  <br>  - Je ne peux pas t'envoyer ma photo en ce moment mais je le ferai à la prochaine fois que tu réponds. <br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>   Both sentences in the second pair are incorrect.<br>  <br>  I think you mean 'e-mail' over 'letters". The correct word for 'an e-mail' is 'un courriel' though you will occasionally see the same in French as it is in English. <br>  I think you want to say 'I prefer e-mail over a letter because of its speed. <br>  <br>         Je préfère un courriel au lieu d'une lettre à cause de son vitesse.<br>  <br>  or literally, 'I prefer an email instead of a letter because of its speed.'<br>  <br>   -Je préfère les mails plut?t que des lettres parce que ?a va plus vite.<br>  - Je préferais les mails plus que des lettres parce que c'est plus rapide.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  "Ta lettre est arrivée samedi dernier"<br>  <br>  The letter has arrived so the action is completed, hence the passé composé tense for the verb. Because 'lettre' is feminine and the verb 'arriver' uses 'être' as an auxiliray verb, the past participle of 'arriver' needs an extra 'e' to agree with the gender of 'lettre' (hnece arrivée)<br>  <br>  **************************************...|`|Vrx086VIaa	Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

pSCHJJ7raa	I am Seventh-day Adventist, I have been since 1979 and I was told when I joined that we are not a perfect people, but we have a perfect message. I believe that is true today. Any church is meant to be a hospital for sinners not a museum of saints. We are not perfect people but by the grace of God we will be. True, Ellen White's writing have been abused, almost as much as the Bible has been misquoted misapplied and abused for what ever reason. I hope those who seem so ready to attack something they look at from the outside will remember something that we teach, God has faithful followers in all churches, and outside of the churches as well, including some Adventist.

If God didn't want us to figure out our problems he would make it impossible.<br>  <br>   Obama knows that with the study of stem cell research it could be possible to save lives and cure diseases, or at least treat them.<br>  Perhaps the most important potential application of human stem cells is the generation of cells and tissues that could be used for cell-based therapies. Today, donated organs and tissues are often used to replace ailing or destroyed tissue, but the need for transplantable tissues and organs far outweighs the available supply. Stem cells, directed to differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>  <br>   I think everything happens for a reason, and I am in support of this.

That's how socialism works.<br>  <br>  More realistic answer: you would have to study more on the issue and see what exactly the stem cell research was and why it needed federal funding. Your average conservative is against stem cell research because of the slippery slope fallacy: first you allow X, then Y will happen, next thing you know Z will happen too. In a nutshell, conservatives do not want anything positive to come from abortions, especially if further research would require more abortions to happen. These conservatives cling to the fantasy that abortion being illegal will mean that it will stop. They are operating from the same mentality of people who thought that prohibition would stop people from drinking or that banning guns will reduce crime. This mentality can be found in nearly every spectrum of the political scale. But back to the point. The stem cell argument has close ties with the abortion issue. As long as the prolife movement is operating as it does now, there will be extreme opposition to stem cell research. Therefore you will find criticism of Obama's decision on this issue.|`|0puMsQJgaa	Simple Answer!<br>  <br>  President Obama is An Abortionist!

29w9pQYwaa	That is one of the most ignorant questions i have heard. Answer this: Why won't christians become muslim so they an have an afterlife which is a million times better? If an atheist took your advice (better known as pascal's wager):<br>  - It would be blasphemy (not truly believing in God)<br>  - And it would be a stupid waste of time.<br>       They are very confident that Christianity is wrong, and will not embarrass themselves by following it. I don't want to get started on christianity (like i do for every other question like this), but with the countless contradictions and massively edited stories in the bible are one of the first things that may turn someone into an atheist. Also there is no proof Jesus existed, or that there is a christian God. So if there is no proof of the christian God and "saviour", other than a book written from century-old stories, which was constantly changed and rewritten. I would personally feel like the dumbest person on Earth to forget that and blindly follow a religion I hate. I could seriously write a 10000 word essay on this if i had the time and space.<br>  AND,<br>  - when you say: "the meaning of death IS life, just read the Gospels of the Man whom we call the Lord Jesus Christ.", Just because someone (no one knows who specifically) wrote that, doesn't mean that it is fact. If i wrote that if you died in a tree, you would come back as a happier person, I don't think you would believe it.<br>   - when you say ":)we don't get virgins, that's silly talk.", you should take a long look at your religion, and think..."Could someone else see that as weird/stupid/silly?" scientology probably looks stupid to you, but the christian church has said to kill people if they do not believe in God etc., etc., and many scientist (ex. Galileo) have proved the christian church WRONG (and many were killed for that). Your religion can look retarded from any other point of view, so think about what you say.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	First, you clearly have no idea what atheists believe. They don't believe you should have fun in this life and throw caution to the wind because there are no penalties.

"why  won't atheist become Christian so they'll know the true meaning of death? suicide is illegal according to the bible, that's why"? What? How do you get from one topic to the next?

cddb777eba8aa486c8115040d8875907aa	The Catholic Church allows the practice of cremation.  The only time cremation would be a problem is if someone was using cremation in order to deny the church's teaching of the resurrection of the body.<br>  <br>  The cremains must be buried or interred in a vault.  They are not to be kept on a shelf or scattered.<br>  <br>  Usually the priest will wear white vestments since the funeral Mass is actually called the Mass of Resurrection and is a celebration of our belief in life everlasting in heaven.  Some older traditional priests will still wear black but thankfully they are few in number.<br>  <br>  Catholics do believe in Purgatory as a step before heaven.  There is no definition of it as an actual physical place and no determination of time.  When we die we will know as God knows.  That means we will realize all the consequences of any action we every committed.  We will know every one who we have ever hurt.  That does not sound like the eternal happiness of heaven. Something happens to purge those memories from us so that we can be forever happy in heaven.  That something that happens is Purgatory.|`|AA10676836	The Catholic church follows Greek mythology that your soul is separate from the body and it goes somewhere when you die. The bible contradicts this. Also they believe in purgatory where people on earth can buy masses and get people into heave, I don't know how much a mass is today but it used to be $10 per mass.

IDZTtipeaa	It is not about finding answers for those who do what you ask about.  Those who ask science questions here, aiming them directly at atheists, are the type who get their scientific info from the Bible, Youtube and AIG.  <br>  There are many reasons they do this.  None of them are good (Christian).

He was lifted up by GOD to be saved from the those who wanted him dead. Among his companions was a betrayer, whom know one knew except GOD.

While Jesus was lifted up (meaning by his whole body) by GOD.<br>  <br>  Also, GOD has told us that Jesus will return.<br>  <br>  <br>  "“They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but they thought they did.” (Quran 4:156) “God lifted him up to His presence.

But I don't like crosses with Christ on them. Christ is no longer on the cross and I find it almost offensive.|`|AA10920670	First off, there is a difference between a cross and what you're asking about - a crucifix.<br>  <br>  The cross actually comes from the ancient Aramaic alephbet. And, no, that's not a misspelling.<br>  <br>  The Tau, a small t, is the last letter of the ancient Aramaic alephbet. Tau signifies "covenant." As in Ezekiel, where God has an angel go through town and mark a tau on the foreheads of everyone under the "covenant."  Many bibles have whitewashed it to say simply 'place a mark."<br>  <br>  So yes, Jesus most definitely approves. Since he would have used the ancient Aramaic, I am the Al (first letter) and Tau (last letter). Which means I am the leader and the covenant.<br>  <br>  As for using the crucifix, that's an entirely different thing. One might use the stigmata - a genuine phenomenon - as evidence to the cause. Since God allows the imprint of the wounds of Christ, to bolster faith, then one would say a crucifix would do the same. We Catholic wear the crucifix to acknowledge the sacrifice Jesus made for us. Sacrifice is not always easy. And it really is not simply about taking care of one another. Jesus himself says one must be ready to lay down one's life for another. THAT kind of sacrifice.<br>  <br>  So it would seem the answer is again yes.

If it were not for Religion, we probably would be in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, sitting on our computers talking about something else. The biggest migration of people to first come to america that actually made it, were very religious people that wanted the Freedom to worship how they chose. The religious power was so oppressive that many small groups of people decided to try their luck here. An Instrumental figure at the time was a man named William Penn.He made it possible for these groups to start settling in the now known area ," Pennsylvania". <br>  Anyway, back then Religion was that important to those people, that it laid the groundwork for the settling of the USA. <br>  When I think of religion I think of church. So when you see all the corruption these days when it has anything to do with money and Power. I can see why people are turned off. <br>   God is our power, and we have the right to organize and connect with the GOD.

Christianity here is rapidly on the rise but this fact is being largely ignored.<br>  <br>  I think that the drop in numbers (if there is one it would only be in the west, as I know that Christianity is on the rise and has six million Islamic converts a year in the east) may be temporary and think it has nothing to do with science.

Everyone believes in something.  Unfortunately, instead of turning to God, some people choose to worship earthly things, like money, material possessions, etc.  Unfortunately, these things aren't going to get them into heaven.  <br>  <br>  Read James 1 and pass it on!<br>  <br>  James 1: 2-8,12 "Concider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverence.  Perseverence must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.  If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.  But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.  That man should not think he will recieve anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does. Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will recieve the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him."|`|jW4LVl8maa	Cause parents don't want their kids 2 get rape by perverts of the church|`|ZAQCvcIyaa	I don't believe in god i believe in science.|`|nfAM7NcMaa	people are thinking if god was real why is the world getting worse why doesnt something good happen for once|`|lci0uwMvaa	I guess I have decided that I am not going to worry about the after-life when I don't know if it exists.

We get that not everyone is going to believe the way we do.  It's when people become irate, rude, and dishonest that they get blocked.  Honestly, why would anyone want to subject themselves to that?  If you asked a question about how to deal with your child's behavior problems and got an answer that you were human trash and should never have had children, would you be inclined to care about the opinion of that person?  I've had several people respectfully disagree with my faith and I can accept that.  Their logic sometimes baffles me, but I can accept they disagree.  It's the ones telling me I'm a member of a cult, going to hell, etc. that tend to get ignored.  It's not about forcing people to agree, it's about being respectful of others' beliefs.|`|AA11714512	I have never blocked anyone.  I never plan on blocking anyone.

They have been mentally conditioned since birth to "follow the prophet; he will never lead you astray." This is, of course, a false statement.

First Vision versions were fabricated - go back to the first version in his own handwriting! <br>  "The Lord's House Need to be Cleansed" Meaning they are the most wicked because they altered the identity of God and other "follies and abominations which ye do before me, saith the Lord" (D&C 124).

She is in a new country, she is originally from Barbados, a small island, and being thrust into the limelight and probably not able to handle it.

But think about it: is it a matter of exposing your personal business or exposing the truth? Or is it slander or information that the public needs to know? Hm..<br>  <br>  I've also heard people bring up the Juanita Bynum thing also. The fact that she was trying to damage her husband's career and that she brought the pain upon herself. I can't really comment on that story, mainly because I don't care. <br>  <br>  Domestic violence does need to be addressed, but since she chose to stay, I'm done with the sympathy.|`|rnMRYBEuaa	We don't know what it's like.<br>  I try to step into her shoes.<br>  I think their relationship was not made up of just constant beatings.

The victim is often so beaten down (no pun intended) that their self-worth, self-esteem, etc is next to nothing. It's sad, but true. Many men and women continually return to abusive relationships because of the emotional and physiological abuse that has taken place.<br>  <br>  It is so easy to judge someone (like Rhianna) when you're not in her position or haven't experienced abuse like this. Of course, I don't agree with her decision, but I am more saddened than anything else. They BOTH need to seek counselling, and of course she should get out of this relationship.

9BeUbORtaa	Purgatory is a place of trial and purgation for souls guilty of venial sins, where they will suffer and endure penitence in preparation for entry into Paradise. <br>  <br>  Limbo is a state experienced by unbaptised infants in some Catholic thought, in which they will dwell eternally without suffering, but alienated from the beatific vision of God through original sin. Belief in Limbo is no longer essential for Catholics (and in fact I don't believe it ever was).|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Purgatory is an official teaching of the Church, with roots in Scripture and Tradition to account for those who die in a state of grace, but who have the imperfection of minor (venial) sin in the soul. We can't be united with God, Who is perfect, in heaven if our soul is still in a state of imperfection. Purgatory is a time of final perfection before entering into heaven. Purgatory is a good and joyful thing. <br>  <br>  "Limbo" is just a theological theory that was never officially taught by Church to somehow account for babies, who died before they were baptized. (The Sanctifying Grace of Baptism is needed for salvation.) <br>  <br>  Babies, like all of us, are born with the Sin of Adam (Original Sin), but died before they were infused with the grace of Baptism needed for salvation. On the other hand, they are innocent of personal sin. Theologians were trying to figure out what happened to them in the overall system of theology. Today, we simply commend them to God's loving mercy.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Limbo was suggested as the place where unbaptized babies went when they died. This idea was never official Church doctrine and has been rejected.<br>  <br>  Purgatory (or purgation) is the process of God's love changing our imperfect selves on earth into perfect beings in heaven. Depending on the amount of change needed by different people, this can be an easy or slightly harder process. Everyone in purgatory is on his or her way to heaven.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Purgatory is the process of being washed clean of our sins by the blood of Jesus.

8kcbn1siaa	Dear Sister, <br>   Forgiveness is like Love--they are not feelings, they are a CHOICE.<br>  The reason a (truly) Christian marriage works is that both partners understand this, and when the (infatuation/romantic) feelings end or falter, they CHOOSE to keep on treating each other in a loving manner.  That is what love really is--it's not how you feel about someone, but how you treat that person.<br>  By the same token, you can choose to forgive this (creepy, unworthy-sounding) person who your heart abhors.  It is a very hard choice to make, but as a counselor, I have seen many severely abused clients do it successfully.  This is how it works: You get before God and say something like "Lord, you know how much I despise this man, and all the hell he put me through. God, I feel hate for him now, but I am choosing, with your help, to forgive him. Please keep me from spiteful actions and attitudes toward him, and cause my feelings to eventually  become one with my choice. Help me find ways to even bless him.  Open my eyes that I might see him and his own brokenness through your eyes of compassion and understanding.. And now I ask you to bless him, heal his heart of any wounds, draw him to yourself, whatever that takes, and cause his life to bring you honor.  And while you are at it, please heal my (and others') hearts of the hurts he caused, too. Thank you for this opportunity to stretch my faith, Lord. Amen."<br>  <br>  I have prayed this prayer myself, as well, for my husband who left me and our three young children for my best friend.  I know it works, if you can entrust any revenge to God.  Your choice to forgive can be instant...but the feelings may take years to follow. That's OK, just keep saying this prayer. You can't control your feelings, and God doesn't expect you to. But he does tell us to forgive, and I'm rooting for you to choose that hard, but beautiful path.<br>  Remember this, too, my friend....Unforgivenesss like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die. So if you can't forgive him for his sake, or for Christ's sake, forgive him for your own sake, because bitterness makes a person sick and stunts their spiritual growth and their own emotional healing, too.  God bless you.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	When you say "it's not working for me" what I hear you saying is, "I'm not willing to let go of this anger and resentment".  I think if you're honest, that is the answer.<br>  <br>  If you pray to Jesus to root out that anger and resentment and replace it with forgiveness and mercy, and if you are willing for Him to do that, it is exactly what will happen.|`|JXfGHsF6aa	"claim this promise" and changing your diet will manage anger, as well!<br>  <br>  Phi 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.|`|piBBg34kaa	It is hard to forgive someone.

Perhaps that person is there to teach you how to deal with troublesome people. You know a life lesson|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It is not true to say that if you don't forgive, then God won't forgive you.  That would be true under the law, but we're not under the law.  The sermon on the mount is mostly law, not grace.  So many people misuse that portion of scripture, it is scary. <br>  <br>  We're not under law.  We're under grace.  Grace is that you are forgiven, so you ought to forgive others (Ephesians 4:32). <br>  <br>  Pray to Jesus and ask Him for power to forgive.  You'll have yourself set free  :)<br>  <br>  And above all, understand the Gospel, because it seems like you don't understand it yet. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

AA11232725	There are a couple of reasons to consider. First of all to address your last point, the God of the Bible does not discriminate on the basis of race but only on the basis of faith and loyalty to Him.<br>  <br>  Second of all, human beings can sense that there is something more than meets the eye. There is the natural revelation of a divine Creator and mankind who has been separated by sin from their Creator seeks various ways in which to search HIm out. That's why Jesus came down to earth to make a living way for people to be reunited with God.<br>  <br>  Third of all, the Bible teaches that Satan seeks to displace God in the hearts of humanity and that he has a host of demonic forces allied with him who are more than happy to deceive people who are trying to find God.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 10:19  What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?  20  Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 4:3  But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,  4  whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:1  And you  He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,  2  in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,  3  among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.|`|VncSMLMpaa	To start from the end, there should be no discrimination because of race alone. What is important is if we serve the one true God as He wishes, not as some false prophet has dictated.<br>  <br>  Of course the one true LORD God Almighty is real. The reason that there are so many gods is that human nature is perverse and will not obey God. Everyone does that which is right in their own sight, not in God's.<br>  <br>  Do read the Bible thoroughly until you really do understand it. In there is the inspired word of God that offers salvation to all men if they will repent, be baptised in water and obey.|`|koynaDYbaa	I wouldn't say there are "different" God's. If you look at Christianity, Islam and Judaism, they all follow similar roots: therefore I would say there is ONE God that people believe DIFFERENT things about, which causes different religions.<br>  The question is which religon and path is correct? That's what we have to decide.<br>  <br>  And yes, I would say religious people would be strong believers in what it says in their book as it provides a basis to religion.|`|SOlh57iKaa	There are many gods (1 Corinthians 8:5) but only one God Almighty (psalms 83:18).

Christians, Muslims and Jews claim to worship the God of Abraham.  Generally speaking, the divisions start with the <br>  role/purpose of Jesus and the truth of the New Testament.  <br>  <br>  As for other gods...I believe there are spiritual entities that have supernatural power. I believe them to be the fallen angels that were kicked out of heaven masquerading as gods, spirit guides, etc.  Their main purpose is to exalt themselves and lead people away from the one true God.|`|AA11570675	There can be only one real God. All the rest are just posing but aren't really gods at all. At best they're just local spirits that aren't universal. A real God would have had to create & hold everything & so be universal.<br>  In the 3 major world religions (Judaism, Christianity & Islam) there's only one God who made the entire universe. You can dismiss Islam as it's just a manufactured religion, made up using altered stories from the other 2 in order to give it's creator a following. Christianity is based on Judaism, claiming to be a fulfilment of Judaism in that Jesus Christ is the Jewish Messiah, which Jews don't accept. So those 2 religions only have one God between them. Other faiths tend to be more like philosophies, often useful paradigms by which to interpret the world but with fairly obvious flaws. Then there are polytheistic faiths like Hinduism which evolved as one religious group after another became prominent in India, so the followers of each religion became layered into different castes within an overall system made up of many separate faiths, usually the older the religion the lower the caste.<br>  So a knowledge of history & how & when each religion formed is a pretty good guide to its validity. But the age of a religion doesn't make it right. <br>  You should evaluate also on whether a faith can apply throughout the world or is geographically centred. Anything centred on Geography alone is obviously not following the true God who created the entire universe, it can be dismissed as following some minor local spirit that likes to pose as a god. For a religion to be true it must be able to apply no matter where its followers live and would not demand that its followers visit any one place - though it may have holy sites which are significant because miracles happened there. Also, the faith should be unchanged throughout mankind's history except that prophecies are clear & repeated by many through the ages before they are finally fulfilled.<br>  Any deity that can be followed only by one race or can only be worshipped in one language is not universalisable therefore unlikely to be the true God, so the faith must be open to all races.<br>  If there is a true God, then He (or She) should be able to reveal himself (or herself) to all people regardless of race or previous religion, but might not necessarily choose to do so. Lets face it, if the true God didn't hide a bit we'd all have just one faith between us. So you'll have to be very open minded & ready to change religion to the true one when you find it. You can be pretty sure from the converse of this that any religion that won't let you leave it is not a true faith & therefore you should leave it.<br>  Finally, religion should be beneficial to the people that follow it & should not bind them down. Any god that is just a burden to its followers isn't worth having either now or in another life so I wouldn't follow that sort of a god anyway, even if it existed.<br>  <br>  So in summary:<br>  One God is likely to be true, many Gods are likely to be deception;<br>  Look at the history of the religion & don't believe anything that appears to be made up by just one man;<br>  Multiple layers are more likely to be an elaborate social system, but don't dismiss it entirely as one of those layers might be the truth;<br>  Anything geographically bound is not univeralisable, therefore unlikely to be true faith;<br>  Look for genuine miracles;<br>  Look at prophecies. Many prophets should confirm them & if theyre fulfilled it should be clear;<br>  Racism is a sign that the faith isn't true;<br>  Pray & see if God is revealed - if not, religion might not be that important anyway so don't get stuck in one that won't let you leave;<br>  Consider whether the god benefits or burdens its followers.<br>  <br>  Obviously these are just my thoughts, but I hope it's a helpful guide to examining the hundreds of religions around.<br>  All the best in your search for the truth.|`|AA12213074	'There is only one God but the wise call Him by many names.' This is what the Vedas say.In a sense, it is also true that there are many Gods. We, each of us, have God in us so what does that make us? Religions came due to the demands of environment. They usually reflect the people and the times.If you note, the two main religions of the Middle East have a harsh and stern feel to them. Christianity was like a rebellion against that and Jesus was influenced by the Buddha and the Guru parampara system of Hinduism. Divisions are a natural human phenomenon. Even those who claim to be all inclusive tend to discriminate, albeit covertly. I tend to question everything respectfully. When something doesn't gel with me, I reject that, again respectfully. I am a Hindu because I find my answers in that religion. I investigated Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism. I found some to be contradictory, some to be misogynist, some too dry and some too violent. So, I rejected them as not for me, with respect. What I can't abide about certain religions or perhaps the followers of those religions, is their absolute certainty that they are always right and everyone else is either misguided or stubborn.I like the message of the movie 'Dogma' which says that it is better to have ideas rather than beliefs. You can challenge or change an idea but beliefs are harder to do so.|`|AA11520296	A majority of the world worships the same God, the Abrahamic God, just under different religions(Islam, Christianity, Judaism)|`|Nxolwd5Baa	MAYBE they are all real!! the universe is a big place hehe :)|`|yyxMzBdDaa	honestly i belive in god

I have assembled the best I can to answer this big question like a little question. YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW ALL THIS THOUGH. YOU SEEM LAZY OR TRIVIAL.<br>  <br>  “To believe always means: to believe someone and to believe something. […] The believer—in the strict sense of the word—accepts a given matter as real and true on the testimony of someone else. That is, in essence, the concept of belief.” (29)<br>  <br>  Then, “For to believe means: to regard something as true and real on the testimony of someone else. Therefore, the reason for believing ‘something’ is that one believes ‘someone.’ Where this is not the case, something other than proper belief is involved.” (30)<br>  <br>  “To believe means: to participate in the knowledge of a knower. […] Belief cannot establish its own legitimacy; it can only derive legitimacy from someone who knows the subject matter of his own accord. By virtue of contact with this someone, belief is transmitted to the believer.” (42)<br>  <br>  “There are several statements implicit in this proposition. To begin with: Belief is by its nature something secondary. Wherever belief is meaningfully held, there is someone else who supports the believer; and this someone else cannot be a believer. Before belief, therefore, come seeing and knowing.” (42)<br>  <br>  “[B]elief has the extraordinary property of endowing the believer with knowledge that would not be available to him by the exercise of his own powers.” (44-45)<br>  <br>  “[T]his act does not take place in a vacuum and without reason—without, for example, some conviction of the credibility of the witness on whom we rely. But this conviction in turn cannot possible be belief; the credibility of the witness whom we believe cannot also be the subject of belief; this is where real knowledge is required. The matter is, to be sure, somewhat complicated.” (45)<br>  <br>  “No one who believes must believe; belief is by its nature a free act.” (49)<br>  <br>  “[T]he certainty of the believer must possess a special quality.” (49)<br>  “There are quite a few definitions of ‘certainty’. […] The first conceives of certainty as a ‘firm assent, that is, assent excluding all doubt and regarded as ultimate’. It is immediately apparent that part of the nature of belief, not only of religious faith, is to be entirely certain in that sense. The concept itself excludes the possibility that belief and uncertainty can coexist side by side.” (49)<br>  <br>  “The second, equally common definition holds that certainty is a ‘firm assent founded on the evidentness of the matter’. [With evidentness meaning nothing more nor less than obviousness. ...] According to this definition, no believer, of course, can possess certainty—for belief means: to accept as true and real a matter that is not in itself obvious.” (49-50)<br>  <br>  “To be sure, the certainty of the believer cannot possibly stretch farther than the insight and reliability of the witness on whom he depends. If, therefore, we read again and again in the old theory of belief that the certainty of belief transcends the certainty of knowledge and insight by an infinite amount, we must consider what grounds there are for this statement. The reason for that transcendent certainty does not lie in the fact that certainty of belief is involved but rather that the believer has to do with a witness whose insight and truthfulness infinitely exceed all human measures. Belief is more certain than any imaginable human insight—not insofar as it is belief, but insofar as it properly rests upon divine speech.” (54)<br>  <br>  “Belief still means: to accept something unconditionally as real and true on the testimony of someone else who understands the matter out of his own knowledge.” (55)<br>  <br>  “[T]he crucial factor of belief never consists in the matters that are believed. The believer, of whatever sort, is not primarily concerned with a given matter but with a given someone. This someone, the witness, the authority, is ‘the principal thing’, since without his testimony the matter would not be believed at all. Herein lies the decisive difference between religious belief and every other kind of belief: the Someone on whose testimony the religious believer accepts a matter as true and real—that Someone is God himself.” (56)|`|UWKF7x4faa	Faith has for far too long been held in high regard as a virtue, when in fact it is an insidious vice that should be given up by all humanity.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I do believe that all faith is blind faith.

8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	At one extreme of its meaning, "myth" is fable, falsehood, or superstition. But at another, "myth" is a useful and fruitful image by which we make sense of life in somewhat the same way that we can explain electrical forces by comparing them with the behavior of water or air. Yet "myth," in this second sense, is not to be taken literally, just as electricity is not to be confused with air or water. Thus in using myth one must take care not to confuse image with fact, which would be like climbing up the signpost instead of following the road. <br>  <br>  <br>  Myth, then, is the form in which I try to answer when children ask me those fundamental metaphysical questions which come so readily to their minds: "Where did the world come from?" "Why did God make the world?" "Where was I before I was born?" "Where do people go when they die?" Again and again I have found that they seem to be satisfied with a simple and very ancient story, which goes something like this: <br>  <br>  <br>  "There was never a time when the world began,because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. Look at my watch, which tells the time; it goes round, and so the world repeats itself again and again. But just as the hour-hand of the watch goes up to twelve and down to six, so,too, there is day and night, waking and sleeping, living and dying,summer and winter. You can't have any one of these without the other,because you wouldn't be able to know what black is unless you had seen it side-by-side with white, or white unless side-by-side with black. <br>  "In the same way, there are times when the world is, and times when it isn't, for if the world went on and on without rest for ever and ever, it would get horribly tired of itself. It comes and it goes. Now you see it; now you don't. So because it doesn't get tired of itself, it always comes back again after it disappears. It's like your breath: it goes in and out, in and out, and if you try to hold it in all the time you feel terrible. It's also like the game of hide-and-seek, because it's always fun to find new ways of hiding, and to seek for someone who <br>  doesn't always hide in the same place. "God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with. But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear. "Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that's the whole fun of it--just what he wanted to do. He doesn't want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self--the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever. "Of course, you must remember that God isn't shaped like a person. People have skins and there is always something outside our skins. If there weren't, we wouldn't know the difference between what is inside and outside our bodies. But God has no skin and no shape because there isn't any outside to him. [With a sufficiently intelligent child, I illustrate this with a M?bius strip--a ring of paper tape twisted once in such a way that it has only one side and one edge.] The inside and the outside of God are the same. And though I have been talking about God as 'he' and not 'she," God isn't a man or a woman. I didn't say 'it' because we usually say 'it' for things that aren't alive. "God is the Self of the world, but you can't see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can't see your own eyes, and you certainly can't bite your own teeth or look inside your head. <br>  <br>  <br>  Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding. "You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn't really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It's the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world."<br>  This story, obviously mythical in form, is not  given as a scientific description of the way things are. Based on the analogies of games and the drama, and using that much worn-out word "God" for the Player, the story claims only to be like the way things are. I use it just as astronomers use the image of inflating a black balloon with white spots on it for the galaxies, to explain the expanding universe. But to most children, and many adults, the myth is at once intelligible, simple, and fascinating. By contrast, so many other mythical explanations of the world are crude, tortuous, and unintelligible.<br>  <br>  <br>  _()_|`|LjsRfaskaa	I think everything will come full circle and the new belief system will be based on Shamanic principles. The only difference between shamanism and quantum physics is the language used. Shamans used what they had available, totems, to describe the nature of an energy. Where the quantum physicists have an advantage of a scientific language to describe the same things. <br>  <br>  Atheism is based on the earth sciences, the base chakra where ego rules. Everything is a natural process of earth. Geology, history, climatic sciences, medicine, etc. <br>  <br>  It is not until you start looking at the nature of matter, what it is made of. The nature of time and how it is relative to speed and gravity. The nature of energy and frequencies and how they affect everything that comes in to contact with them. That you start to realize there is much more going on than meets the eye. <br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|503991d7e18cf8ad3b3864e35df39ec3aa	No, religion - whatever its based on - could not be accurate idea.<br>  But the new understanding of God/the universe, would be more accurate than the old one.<br>  <br>  it would be like .. going back to the future!|`|8Zey1ntAaa	So you're looking for a new, scientific definition of an eternal, unchanging sky daddy?|`|ni6SCUm9aa	The point of religion is that 'the truth' is not tainted.<br>  <br>  If things were altered, it would be as if god was lying or something.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I don't think so. Shakespeare, Homer, and Leonidas would never allow it.<br>  <br>  The reason I say that is this. What religion is about, and what religion teaches us has little, if anything, to do with the level of science or technology we enjoy. Stealing is still stealing regardless of if you steal an I-Pod or thirty pieces of silver. Murder is murder regardless of if you hit your victim with a bronze headed mace or shoot them with an AK-47.<br>  <br>  What religion deals with are...for lack of a better word...transcendental questions. "What happens after I die?" " How should we treat each other?" "Who is my neighbor?" <br>  <br>  Shakespeare's plays still speak to us after over 400 years, and Homer's stories still excite us after 3,000 years, and Leonidas' bravery at the Pass of Thermopylae still inspires us after 2300 years because they reach into a place within us that isn't about steam engines or dual core processors, they reach to something that is fundamental in, and common to all humans. <br>  <br>  Aristotle's logic and philosophy is still worth reading, even though his astronomy is less than stellar, as are Plato, and Hobbes, and Locke and Marcus Aurelius.  People don't change, they just get more expensive and deadlier toys.<br>  <br>  So what was true 2000 years ago is still true today, and it is on those levels that the important things in life occur. If your wife cheats on you with your best friend, does it hurt any less because a Republican is President instead of a Democrat?  If someone breaks into your house and robs you, will the confirmation of the existance of the Higgs Boson make it easier for you to deal with?  If your kid gets sick and dies does it hurt less because you live in the 21st Century instead of the 18th or the 12th?<br>  <br>  So no. Scientific truth is great. I love technology and vaccines and air contitioning and anti-biotics are all great, but technology is over-rated. Putting a man on the Moon it can do...dealing with the Human soul, that's beyond it's paygrade.

If you mean generally any system that contains many interacting parts which performs some specific set of functions then machines and living things could be claimed to be complete systems.  However next you would have to prove that all complete systems must have been designed, engineered and built to work with specificity.  Yes mechanical systems need to be designed, engineered and built because their components do not interact with each other on their own through any natural forces the way chemicals do.  But living things are made up of chemical components that do interact with each other through natural forces such as chemical bonds and chemical reactions.  It's this fact that allows them to reproduce in the first place.  Haven't you ever wondered why machines don't reproduce?  It's because their components don't interact with each other on their own.  They don't have the same internal chemical reactions producing energy to do work and to induce growth for cell division.  For this reason machines can't reproduce, however living things can.<br>  <br>  Your last sentence, though, was correct, but what good is it to be right for the wrong reasons.  In fact nothing does evolve into a complete reproducing system.  This is because the ability for a system to reproduce itself is a necessary condition for that system to be able to evolve.  So reproduction has to be present in the system first before evolution is possible.  It's not the only condition that's necessary for evolution, though, so reproduction is not itself a necessary and sufficient condition.  But it is still a very necessary condition.  Reproduction, Inheritability and Variation are the three necessary and sufficient conditions to allow for evolution to happen.  The rest follows from logic alone.|`|IdAHdu9laa	I read Darwin, that's why I ignore 'The Obvious'.|`|Cgz1n3xNaa	I wish you would've posted this in the biology section.

LuN1unJ3aa	The concept is not scriptural (at least, Biblical) that is, it does not appear in the Bible. The phrase is in the United States Declaration of Independence.<br>  <br>  The quotation "All men are created equal" is arguably the best-known phrase in any of America's political documents, as the idea it expresses is generally considered the foundation of American government. Thomas Jefferson first used the phrase in the Declaration of Independence as a rebuttal to the going political theory of the day: the Divine Right of Kings. Jefferson borrowed the expression from an Italian friend and neighbor, Philip Mazzei, as noted by Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress as well as John F. Kennedy in "A Nation Of Immigrants."<br>  <br>  Edit Add: Sense of fairness... I think that is what we consider to be fair more than anything that might apply to deity. For instance, I have yet to hear of a teenager who, at some point in their teen life, has not shouted at an adult (parent, teacher, etc.), "That's not fair!" or, "That is so unfair!"<br>  <br>  What is fair?|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Um... no.  Only the "created" part.  To answer that question: Do most Atheists believe all people are equal?  Yes (more than religious people, actually).  So of course not.<br>  <br>  It's a matter of morality.  The morality of human decency doesn't come from a religion.<br>  <br>  It comes from the heart - which tells us we should treat all people with respect, that tells us that it's wrong to hurt people.<br>  <br>  It comes from the brain - which tells us that all humans on Earth have virtually the same DNA.  Studies have shown over and over that all races score the same on IQ tests, social adjustment tests, and every other test you can think of.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Are all of the human races really equal? We like to assume so, because "God wouldn't turn out an inferior product". <br>  <br>  That's not quite right.<br>  <br>  The idea that all people  are created equal IS religious, (you are correct). However it does not stem from a fictional equality of ability (there is none), but rather from an equality of value.<br>  <br>  The two are separate and distinct. Some people do have more tallent and ability than others, there is no debating that. The thing is, that is not where their value comes from.<br>  <br>  All people have value because all people are made in the image and likeness of God, and because Christ's sacrifice on the Cross was made for all of us. Christ died for ALL of us,  not just the smart, the pretty and the strong.  <br>  <br>  So every person you meet is of such value that the Highest form of Life in the Universe came to Earth, was born, lived, suffered, and died for that person... and thought it was worth the trouble and effort to do so. That must make that person pretty valuable.<br>  <br>  So people, all people, have infinite value. They have this value regardless of if they are  black, white, asian, born, unborn, sick, old, stupid, smart, poor, rich, pretty, ugly, fat, think, "Jew or Greek, Slave or Free". They have infinite value because   God, so loved them that He sent his Only Begotten Son here to suffer and die so that they may have eternal life.<br>  <br>  So your value as a person doesn't come from anything other than the fact you ARE a person.  A person made in the image and likness of God.<br>  <br>  That is why  the Bible says that God is no respecter of persons. Partially this means that God doesn't really care how many degrees you have, how much money you made, what rank you were in the Army, if you have a title or not, or who your grandparents were. (This is no doubt in part due to the fact that it is hard to impress someone who can make galaxies out of nothing simply by saying "Let there be light"). Mainly though it is because  God loves us all, and values us for who we are, not for what we do.<br>  <br>  And YES it IS a religious idea, that all people are of infinite value. You can be glad of it. History shows that society gets really, really nasty when that particular idea isn't around.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	We are all equal in God's view<br>  <br>  There are cultural differences (obviously) but no one person or race is better than another<br>  <br>  Anyone who thinks one race is better than another is setting himself up higher than God.<br>  <br>  Acts 10:34<br>  "Opening his mouth, Peter said: "I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality," NASB|`|dDMOJWxwaa	The human race is like an orchestra, all to an individual level have talents and abilities of one type and degree.

That may just be a product of education (Asians tend to go through much more rigorous education, possibly why they do so well academically), but genetics could also come into play.<br>  <br>  Do we judge based on these things? If we do, it's a sin. I guarantee there are Negroids, Mongoloids and Caucasoids that are smarter, stronger, faster, et cetera than me in the world. I have no idea what a person is like inside by looking at them. <br>  <br>  All men being created equal is simply not in the Bible (unless you're talking about sin or the idea that all die). The differences is a result of the fall of mankind, degradation in genetics, and ultimately sin. When man was first created, in their sinless state, they would've all been equal (if Adam and Eve had propagated before their fall). But it's simply not true; sin has corrupted our entire race, and the physical and mental effects of that are sometimes unevenly spread. <br>  <br>  BUT: what really matters is that we're all equally sinFUL,  and all equally need salvation.

AA10276712	Yes...and no.<br>  <br>  Buddhism IS a religion and while few Buddhist teachers, masters or monastics would ever turn a person away from practice because they still clung to other religious traditions, these people could not become true 'Buddhists' in a traditional or orthodox sense. This is because to "Be a Buddhist" one must take refuge in the triple gem. That is to say, go to the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha for refuge. To take refuge one commits themselves to the Buddha (All Buddhas) as their teacher and role model, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha) as the basis for their learning, and the Sangha (the teachers, masters, monastics and learned Buddhists) for support and understanding. This also implies that ONLY the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha are to be taken as refuge. One can not got to the Buddha for refuge if one has taken refuge (worships) some other god, entity, power or idea. <br>  <br>  So, while you would never be turned away, you would not truly be a Buddhist. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|wsc96EDmaa	there are people who combine Buddhism with their faith, Im sure some flexibility and compromise is required.|`|RckU5Wbpaa	Buddhism isn't about "nothingness" and "emptiness".

xyIZv6iiaa	you've got some really good answers here - let me just add this.....<br>  it's about progression, not perfection.  The important thing is to just keep working on stuff.<br>  <br>  My mom was a huge coffee drinker when she joined and it was a very difficult thing for her to give up.  Eventually, she just replaced it with Dr. Pepper (lol  :D) - but once she did, she never looked back, and never once regretted her decision.  She used to say looking at us (her kids) that knowing that she could have the chance to have us in her world forever was well worth anything else she had to do.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Remember, we all have our troubles and vices - even those of us who appear to be doing wonderfully struggle with something.|`|jdRKZe18aa	To be honest - just liking or feeling good about this, or any church isn't ENOUGH.  If you felt this 100% certainty about it's truthfulness and need and desire in your life & heart to be a part of the LDS CHurch and NONE other - then you would be ready to give up such inconsequential things as coffee, tea and other things that the church holds as Word of Wisdom tenants of our faith.<br>  <br>  If you have not been taught, learned, studied, prayed and obtained a personal witness for yourself about this church - then you are clearly either not ready for such a committment, or this church is not for you.<br>  You can attend most any church and like it and even feel good about it - but members of the LDS CHURCH  make very real and personal promises with the Lord, promises of personal purity, personal abstainance from certain substances, promises of sacrafice and obedience, promises and convenants that come with it eternal blessings from God when they are kept.  THIS is not a church for the slothful, laid back, burger king - have it your way church attender!  <br>  <br>  If you do not have a testimony of Joseph Smith as a Prophet of God, the Book of Mormon as a 2nd witness of Christ, of the restored Gospel of Christ, modern day prophets & priesthood authority, if you are not ready to give up the worldly ways of mortality, realize eternal promises that only this church offers and understands and give your life in the service of your fellow man by baptism into His church - then by all means don't go further.<br>  <br>  The "sacrafice of all things" worldly is what we believe is expected of all who sincerely seek Jesus CHrist and His true church.  No one claims to be better than anyone else or perfect by any stretch of the imagination - but most who belong to this church truly live their daily lives for the gospel of Jesus CHrist.<br>  SO you either need to take the necessary leap of faith here and go for it with all your heart & Souls - OR realize that you are not ready for what is necessary to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  It's a big committment, it's a life changing one and it's an eternal beautiful one too for those who truly seek Jesus Christ's gospel for their lives.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	First, let me congratulate you on your sincere efforts to learn about the gospel as taught by inspiration from the Holy Ghost.  That good feeling you have is the Holy Ghost confirming the truth of the message to your hearts and minds.<br>  Second, I am in awe of those that have the courage to recognize the truth as adults and make the necessary changes in their lives to conform with what the Lord expects of us.  It is not an easy transformation.  <br>  In the Book of Mosiah, the sons of Mosiah, particularly Aaron, were teaching the Lamanite King and the King was so impressed by the Spirit that he declared that he would give up all his sins in order to feel the peace and joy of the spirit.  He then fell to the ground as the Spirit worked upon his soul to cleans him of his sins.<br>  The point is that when we accept the gospel, we want to become clean and become like Christ in every way.  The spirit can work through us better when our minds and our bodies are clean and free from impurities, be they physical or spiritual.  That is why we eat healthy foods and read sound literature.  <br>  I have been in the Church all my life (6th generation) and have grown up with these standards.  I have always felt the wisdom and good judgment of following the advise and counsel of the general authorities.  I figured, why should I try to create a path for my life when many, wiser and more knowledgeable than me, have already set up a path for me to follow.  Why reinvent the wheel?  So I have chosen to follow the path described by the modern prophets and have drawn much closer to Christ than I ever could have done on my own.<br>  So, in closing, I encourage you to stick with it.  Stay the course and make every effort to clean up your lives in conformity with what Christ expects of all of us.  It will not be an overnight accomplishment but a life-long endeavor.  <br>  I know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true church of Christ.  The priesthood of God is found there and it is led by revelation from prophets and apostles.  Who am I, or you for that matter, to question their inspiration?  I can, and do, get spiritual confirmation from my own prayers that what I am being taught is true.<br>  Again I congratulate you on your investigations and encourage you to stick with it.<br>  Best wishes always.|`|TzY9vkinaa	You are going to be blessed for making that sacrifice.

We all have things that we struggle with - and there are many addictions out there.  Already giving up some is great progress.  <br>  <br>  There are groups to help with addiction - since the coffee and tea will need to be tackled before you are baptised, and married.  I would suggest that asking for help from the Bishop/Branch Preisdent in overcoming these addictions might be your next step.  They want to help you, and you are not the only people that fight with addictions.  <br>  <br>  Go to the Lord in humble and earnest prayer - He wants to help you as well.<br>  <br>  The road back to our Father in Heaven is not the easiest looking path to commit to take, but it is the one that is the most fulfilling.|`|CTxGUFZOaa	Jesus said "Follow me."

It wil be hard for a moment, but then you'll feel the arms of mercy surround you and you'll feel supported.<br>  <br>  God won't ask you to do anything that you can't; it's not His intention to have you give anything up, He's trying to give you more than what you already have.<br>  <br>  It's worth it!  It really really is!|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	You've been given some good answers.

First of all, as hard as those commandments seem to you right now, they were given to us from a loving Father who only wants the best for us.  He wants us to live long, happy lives free of the addictions that distract us from Him and have brought so much misery to so many.  As hard as it can be to give up some of those things, you will find that your life improves dramatically once you have.  You will be healthier, you will be closer to God, and you will be closer to each other.  The Word of Wisdom is a gift.<br>  <br>  That said, I do know how hard this is for you.  Still, since this is so important to God and so important for you, of course God will help you with this.  As long as you're willing to make the sacrifices and put your trust in Him, He'll help you get through this.  He always does.<br>  <br>  Two of my closest friends were like your man.  Both were seemingly incurable chain-smokers, and both were utterly terrified at the prospect of even TRYING to quit.  It can be an understandably daunting process, but neither of my friends has so much as thought about a cigarette in nearly three years.  The one tells me on an almost daily basis how different her life is, because not only can she actually breathe without struggling, but everything in her life has gotten better.  She has stronger relationships, better health, more faith...the list can go on and on, but I promise that it can be done.  If you and your man are willing to put in the effort, God will help you do this.<br>  <br>  I have a few things that might help with the smoking, at least.  Many years ago, a member of the church came up with a program to help people stop smoking.  I used it countless times while I was on a mission, and as long as the person I was working with kept to the program, it never failed.  If you'd like, I can email the steps to you. <br>  <br>  And I'm not really sure why marriage is a problem.  Do you struggle with the idea for financial reasons?  Or is there more to it?|`|AA10637643	My husband drank alcohol and coffee for years.  It was very hard for him to quit both, especially coffee because he never ate breakfast.  What helped him was realizing WHY he was quitting those things and what the "reward" I guess you could say was.  The Lord has specifically said we should not partake of those things.  If you believe the gospel is true, then ALL parts of it must be true, we can't pick and choose which things we should or shouldn't do.  Also - the "reward", by quitting those things, we were able to be sealed together as an eternal family.  So, maybe your husband (and you) needs to ask himself, are the things I'm giving up worth what I am getting in return?  The answer *should* be a resounding YES.<br>  <br>  I know the gospel is true.  I wish you well in your journey to eternity.|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	Josh's answer is a compelling one to think about what you and your partner should do for your benefit. Stopping smoking and consuming the "hot drinks" seems to be a most difficult action to accomplish, but it can be done.<br>  <br>  I've never been a drug addict, but I smoked heavily and loved my coffee to the extreme before my baptism. I was able to cut such pleasures from my life because I knew the Church was truly the restored Church of Jesus Christ and I wanted to be part of it.<br>  <br>  I still miss a beer with my pizza or Mexican food, but I dismiss the thought because of the promises--and the wishes of the Lord that are in the Word of Wisdom.<br>  <br>  As you work on building your faith and testimony these other deterrants will fall to the side. You will be the better for it and so will your partner if both of you are strong enough to work at this together.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you realize that a prerequisite to baptism in the LDS Church is to obey the Word of Wisdom and separate yourself from "your man" or get married.<br>  <br>  I wish you success in bearing up to the challenges of membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We need you so don't let some addictive vices hold you back from your exaltation in the next life.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	No one will ever "force" you to do anything you want.

They both come to church every week, he has said he knows the Book of Mormon is true, he feels great coming to Church every week, he has had the missionary discussion and likes every thing about the church.

But people haven't forgotten this. The truth is, most of us have never been told about these tragedies.<br>  <br>  The Jews have been very vocal as a group about their sufferings (which no one should deny), and since the War have received much media attention and political advancement as a result.<br>  <br>  The Christians brutalized by the Turks and the Russian Communists have not sought recognition or recompense on the same scale as the Jews and Zionists.|`|0s8uOZHCaa	The World War 2 Holocaust was a lie. 250,000 people died, not 6 million. After World War 2 there were more Jews living than before.|`|rh8szekzaa	There have been plenty of cases of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the world. I could name a couple that are taking place right now. Unfortunately, these things don't really happen in the developed world anymore so nobody cares about Sudan or Uganda or Darfur.<br>  <br>  Btw, the total number of victims due to to Nazis genocidal policies is between 9 and 11 million. It is generally agreed that 6 million Jews (some say even more) did perish during WW2. There is no question. Figures have been checked and re-checked over the years and that is the figue that historians have come to agree on. So it is incorrect to say that not many think this is the number of Jewish victims, because it wouldn't be in every history book in the world if it wasn't. I haven't met anyone who claims otherwise either.
FyLfEPv0aa	Paul actually speaks of that in Romans which coincides with what Smith taught by saying that those under the law are judged by the law and those who don't know the law are judged without the law.<br>  <br>  As a Mormon coffee is something that I'll never drink and never have; yet I won't ever look at people coming out of Starbucks and think "what evil sinners, they're going to hell" because coffee isn't prohibited by their religion.<br>  <br>  In the same way although our religion is strict in many matters, we who covenanted with God to follow it hold ourselves to a higher standard than what others may be held to.<br>  <br>  So take an example of a man living in the year 1200 AD in Nairobi who is a herdsman and has never heard about Jesus Christ.  How will he be judged?  The answer is the same for all men - by our actions.  Not knowing Christ he still has a choice to be Christ-like and loving to his fellow man.  In this case there are some men who can know the master that they haven't served but no man can know the master who he refuses to serve.<br>  <br>  LDS theology doesn't damn people outside of our faith; we accept them for what they have and who they are.  If there are good points to our religion we hope others will come join us and benefit from those good points - but bring the good you already have and the faith you already have.<br>  <br>  So it's the good that knowledge of God can give to you which is important.  We constantly share our religion with our friends because it enriches our life and makes us happy; so the desire to serve God by serving our fellowman makes us want to share this with others.<br>  <br>  A Book of Mormon prophet speaks of a dream in which a white fruit represented the love of God and he wanted to share it with others. How selfish would he have been to think "if they don't every try anything this good they won't know what they're missing anyway".  Rather his intent was to share what brought him joy to others.<br>  <br>  Ignorance isn't bliss, it's ignorance.  We're also told that the glory of God is intelligence.|`|GPn55rjTaa	Yes, but don't forget that we all will be judged on our earthly experiences and trials.  If you had the opportunity to hear the gospel and didn't, you will be judged on that.  Besides, the blessings of this life make it all worth it!<br>  <br>  Thanks for your nice question.  We don't get a lot of nice Mormon questions around here.|`|AA10637643	You have it just a little mixed up, but that's OK...<br>  <br>  Those who die under the age of 8 will inherit a place in the Celestial Kingdom guaranteed, having died before the age of accountability.<br>  <br>  There are several possibilities for those who die without the knowledge of the gospel - and for those who "knew of" the gospel but hadn't accepted it.  (And of course, this is my own understanding of how things work and is in no way the "official doctrine" of the church.)<br>  <br>  Let's say there was a person who lived and died, without ever the knowledge of Christ or his gospel.  The options:<br>  The person is taught the gospel, accepts it, (we have done their ordinances by proxy) and is able to inherit a place in the CK.<br>  The person is taught the gospel but doesn't accept it, they were a good person on earth, so would most likely go to the Terrestrial Kingdom.<br>  The person was very unrighteous on earth, doesn't accept the gospel and goes to the Telestial Kingdom.<br>  <br>  No one can be saved in ignorance, no.  Because one day, every tongue shall confess that Jesus IS the Christ, so all WILL know, even if they don't accept his gospel, they will still know He is the Christ.<br>  <br>  There is also the point of "the chance" to accept the gospel.  IF a person HAS the chance to accept it here - and only God knows that - and they don't, then they do in the next life, they can't go to the CK because they missed their "first" chance to accept it.  <br>  <br>  It's kind of hard to explain, but it all depends on their knowledge and acceptance.  We shouldn't do away with it, because it makes our lives better and builds the Kingdom of God on the earth.  Also, just "doing away" with it kind of takes away their right to choose if they want to accept it or not...<br>  <br>  Anyhoo, just my understanding.|`|ApyKiltXaa	This is from the teaching of Joseph Smith.  I've added the link to the book below.<br>  <br>  “The great designs of God in relation to the salvation of the human family, are very little understood by the professedly wise and intelligent generation in which we live. Various and conflicting are the opinions of men concerning the plan of salvation, the [requirements] of the Almighty, the necessary preparations for heaven, the state and condition of departed spirits, and the happiness or misery that is consequent upon the practice of righteousness and iniquity according to their several notions of virtue and vice. … <br>  <br>  “… While one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy, the Great Parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; He views them as His offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men, causes ‘His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.’ [Matthew 5:45.] He holds the reins of judgment in His hands; He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the narrow, contracted notions of men, but, ‘according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil,’ or whether these deeds were done in England, America, Spain, Turkey, or India. He will judge them, ‘not according to what they have not, but according to what they have’; those who have lived without law, will be judged without law, and those who have a law, will be judged by that law. We need not doubt the wisdom and intelligence of the Great Jehovah; He will award judgment or mercy to all nations according to their several deserts, their means of obtaining intelligence, the laws by which they are governed, the facilities afforded them of obtaining correct information, and His inscrutable designs in relation to the human family; and when the designs of God shall be made manifest, and the curtain of futurity be withdrawn, we shall all of us eventually have to confess that the Judge of all the earth has done right [see Genesis 18:25].” - Joseph Smith<br>  <br>  Thank you for also being polite.|`|jOTN2MgMaa	tough one, it is said that young ones go to heaven, miscarriages abortions and kids who are not old enough to be responsible for themselves.   and i doubt its possible to find osmeone who has never heard of religion. even in the most remote part of the worlds  they are spiritual, we are spiritual beings,  the bible says if you look for Me you will find Me.|`|0T3weRh5aa	Actually JS said you can't be saved in ignorance D&C 131<br>  <br>  Actually why an innocent child who has not sinned won't be granted a spot in the highest kingdom of heaven?<br>  <br>  He is saved by the atonement of Jesus Christ<br>  <br>  You are judged by the light and knowledge you do know<br>  He never said people won't know about religion or christianity, they will know to a certain way and be judged by that|`|MeKe9i7Qaa	Just so you know, the Prophet Joseph Smith is the head of the Church of Latter Day Saints.  The LDS church is not part of mainstream Christianity.  What he says doesn't apply to most Christians.<br>  <br>  However, yes, the innocent do go to heaven.  But that doesn't mean we should swipe out religion.  That in itself would be a sin. Also, the Bible says that those who have never heard of God should be able to look at creation and tell that there is a Maker, and through that knowledge worship the Maker, and therefore God.  Even if you did eliminate Christianity, we would still be held responsible to know that there is a God.|`|PtIyg9Qqaa	The Bible says that all a person has to do is look at "nature" to realize that there is a God.  Those who do as God wants them to do, even if they don't know him, will have their part in the world to come.<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith is a different case. The man was a charlatan, a con man. He was ignorant of Hebrew/Jewish practices and language, and his English wasn't all that great either.  The Book of Mormon is a complete snow job, except where he ACCURATELY used Bible passages.  But there are many that are complete prevarications.<br>  <br>  One small example:  1 Nephi 11:6 says: "And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the eath, yea, even above all."<br>  <br>  This shows his ignorance of the Hebrew word "hosanna." It means "save us now."  How does that fit into the sentence?  "Save us now to the Lord, the most high God."<br>  <br>  He called Mary, the mother of Jesus "exceedingly fair and white."  He obviously didn't know that middle-eastern semites are olive-skinned and would not be "exceedingly white."<br>  <br>  I could go on but I won't.  Suffice to say, Joseph Smith is someone whose writings should NOT be accepted.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	That statement refers to those that didn't have a chance to learn the gospel in this life will learn it in the spirit world after mortality and then be able to accept the blessing provided to them.  If we fail to teach the blessings of the gospel, then we have fallen short of our responsibility and would be no longer eligible to enter heaven ourselves.  Furthermore, there is another scripture that states that he who gains more knowledge more in this life through his diligence and obedience, will have so much the advantage in the world to come.  In other words, the ignorant in mortality will have a chance to learn after mortality, but they would have a greater spiritual advantage if they had learned during mortality.  Therefore, we spread/teach the gospel to all the world to help others to have that spiritual advantage as well as to fulfill our own obligation and commandment to teach it to all the world.<br>  So while I appreciate your thoughts about leaving them in ignorance, it is not quite that easy.  They need the gospel as soon as they can get it and we need to share what we have been given.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	yeah, there is no heaven moron"<br>  <br>  gotta love the "unsaved"  :)<br>  <br>  i bear witness of jesus. i have had Nde's and Obe's and spiritual dreams and vision/dreams and at least one visitation and the appearance of angel "like" being in my bedroom. <br>  <br>  but those that TRULY have never had the gospel introduced intheir life will get a 2nd chance!<br>  <br>  i doubt there are any pigmies left on earth that havent had some form of the gospel taught to them. the name of jesus is even mentioned in the Koran. so All of islam knows of jesus, even if it is the wrong version of the truth. <br>  <br>  joseph smith taught that Everyone who dies in their sins, including Mormons, will go to hell. if they do not repent. <br>  but he also questioned what is Hell? because reading revelation of john he found a curious statement about having "torment" in the presense of angels. <br>  <br>  the bible says in a couple places that christians will go through the 2nd death too. as well those that speak his name on their lips but are far from him. which can only mean christians. some will not enter gods kingdom there will be gnashing of teeth.

If people have the goal of using this forum to convert others to their way of thinking, they are probably taking this whole thing much too seriously.  What's also true is that the attitude that people use, both in "real" life and on this forum, does have an effect in the way that they are perceived by their fellow human beings, and there's nothing about that that should come as a suprise to you.  If you come up with a question and a testy attitude, you're  probably going to get more testy responses than if you come across as nice or loving.  I've noticed that your questions often come with what I consider to be flawed logic or with a decided heavy-handedness towards Christians, and I often point out to you that other people are doing the same things that you're talking about.

Satan tampered with the fourth commandment also, and essayed to set aside the ancient Sabbath, the day which God had blessed and sanctified, and in its stead to exalt the festival observed by the heathen as "the venerable day of the sun." This change was not at first attempted openly. In the first centuries the true Sabbath had been kept by all Christians. They were jealous for the honor of God, and, believing that His law is immutable, they zealously guarded the sacredness of its precepts. But with great subtlety Satan worked through his agents to bring about his object. That the attention of the people might be called to the Sunday, it was made a festival in honor of the resurrection of Christ. Religious services were held on it; yet it was regarded as a day of recreation, the Sabbath being still sacredly observed.<br>  <br>       Constantine, while still a heathen, issued a decree enjoining the general observance of Sunday as a public festival throughout the Roman Empire. After his conversion he remained a stanch advocate of Sunday, and his pagan edict was then enforced by him in the interests of his new faith. But the honor shown this day was not as yet sufficient to prevent Christians from regarding the true Sabbath as the holy of the Lord. Another step must be taken; the false sabbath must be exalted to an equality with the true. A few years after the issue of Constantine's decree, the Bishop of Rome conferred on the Sunday the title of Lord's day. Thus the people were gradually led to regard it as possessing a degree of sacredness. Still the original Sabbath was kept.<br>  <br>       The archdeceiver had not completed his work. He was resolved to gather the Christian world under his banner, and to exercise his power through his vice-gerent, the proud pontiff who claimed to be the representative of Christ. Through half-converted pagans, ambitious prelates, and world-loving churchmen he accomplished his purpose. Vast councils were held, from time to time, in which the dignitaries of the church were convened from all the world. In nearly every council the Sabbath which God had instituted was pressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was correspondingly exalted. Thus the pagan festival came finally to be honored as a divine institution, while the Bible Sabbath was pronounced a relic of Judaism, and its observers were declared to be accursed.<br>  <br>       The great apostate had succeeded in exalting himself "above all that is called God, or that is worshipped." 2 Thess. 2:4. He had dared to change the only precept of the divine law that unmistakably points all mankind to the true and living God. In the fourth commandment God is revealed as the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and is thereby distinguished from all false gods. It was as a memorial of the work of creation that the seventh day was sanctified as a rest day for man. It was designed to keep the living God ever before the minds of men as the source of being and the object of reverence and worship. Satan strives to turn men from their allegiance to God and from rendering obedience to His law; therefore he directs his efforts especially against that commandment which points to God as the Creator.<br>  <br>       Protestants now urge that the resurrection of Christ on Sunday made it the Christian Sabbath. But Scripture evidence is lacking. No such honor was given to the day by Christ or His apostles. The observance of Sunday as a Christian institution has its origin in that "mystery of lawlessness" which, even in Paul's day, had begun its work. Where and when did the Lord adopt this child of the Papacy? What valid reason can be given for a change concerning which the Scriptures are silent?|`|SHtTPBieaa	No one is sure what the man said, everything written is from a hundred years or so after he was dead.

Some non-Catholics try to show from this document that it was the beginning of the Catholic Church. This is absolutely not true as the document clearly shows. <br>  <br>  <br>  When I, Constantine Augustus, as well as I, Licinius Augustus, fortunately met near Mediolanurn (Milan), and were considering everything that pertained to the public welfare and security, we thought, among other things which we saw would be for the good of many, those regulations pertaining to the reverence of the Divinity ought certainly to be made first, so that we might grant to the Christians and others full authority to observe that religion which each preferred; whence any Divinity whatsoever in the seat of the heavens may be propitious and kindly disposed to us and all who are placed under our rule. And thus by this wholesome counsel and most upright provision we thought to arrange that no one whatsoever should be denied the opportunity to give his heart to the observance of the Christian religion, of that religion which he should think best for himself, so that the Supreme Deity, to whose worship we freely yield our hearts, may show in all things His usual favor and benevolence. Therefore, your Worship should know that it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever, which were in the rescripts formally given to you officially, concerning the Christians and now any one of these who wishes to observe Christian religion may do so freely and openly, without molestation. We thought it fit to commend these things most fully to your care that you may know that we have given to those Christians free and unrestricted opportunity of religious worship. When you see that this has been granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made we that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion. <br>  Moreover, in the case of the Christians especially we esteemed it best to order that if it happens anyone heretofore has bought from our treasury from anyone whatsoever, those places where they were previously accustomed to assemble, concerning which a certain decree had been made and a letter sent to you officially, the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception, Those, moreover, who have obtained the same by gift, are likewise to return them at once to the Christians. Besides, both those who have purchased and those who have secured them by gift, are to appeal to the vicar if they seek any recompense from our bounty, that they may be cared for through our clemency. All this property ought to be delivered at once to the community of the Christians through your intercession, and without delay. And since these Christians are known to have possessed not only those places in which they were accustomed to assemble, but also other property, namely the churches, belonging to them as a corporation and not as individuals, all these things which we have included under the above law, you will order to be restored, without any hesitation or controversy at all, to these Christians, that is to say to the corporations and their conventicles: providing, of course, that the above arrangements be followed so that those who return the same without payment, as we have said, may hope for an indemnity from our bounty. In all these circumstances you ought to tender your most efficacious intervention to the community of the Christians, that our command may be carried into effect as quickly as possible, whereby, moreover, through our clemency, public order may be secured. Let this be done so that, as we have said above, Divine favor towards us, which, under the most important circumstances we have already experienced, may, for all time, preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state. Moreover, in order that the statement of this decree of our good will may come to the notice of all, this rescript, published by your decree, shall be announced everywhere and brought to the knowledge of all, so that the decree of this, our benevolence, cannot be concealed.
373KJjiOaa	Perhaps the meaning being implied is that homosexuality is not genetic but is an acquired behavior. Re the mental disorder, the choice is not in acquiring it, but in refusing to seek help for it.<br>  <br>  It would seem that you have a rather poor conception of what constitutes a mental disorder. Unlike physical illness, mental disorders, not all but most, have a definite "choice" component. <br>  <br>  The choice may become a compulsion, but it is still, essentially, a choice made due to exposure to certain environmental factors that shape a person.|`|0yTM98Odaa	A mental disorder?  what century are people who say that living in!|`|AA11849917	I'm somewhat confused by your question/statements here.<br>  <br>  I've never heard ANY Christian suggest that homosexuality was the result of a mental disorder.  It may result in mental disorders, but caused by?  Not according to those of us who have studied the Bible and knows what it says.<br>  <br>  People are ALWAYS trying to make excuses for their sins, no matter WHAT kind of sinful lifestyle they're involved in!<br>  <br>  Rather than own up and take moral responsibility, people try to blame everybody from Adam to their parents and everyone in between, including God!  But it is not Adam's fault, it MIGHT be your parents' faults (or someone else) if you were physically abused, but I once heard the testimony of a man who WAS physically abused, but with some counseling he's now living a normal and healthy life, so even having been physically abused isn't totally a good excuse.  Why can't we just own up to our own moral failings, ask God to forgive us, and repent (with God's help)?  Why must everybody try to find someone else to blame for their moral short comings?|`|TyRfv0eoaa	They're grasping at straws. The fact that homosexuality exists throughout nature tells them they can't call it unnatural. Mental disorder worked until the people whose job it is to classify mental disorders said that it wasn't.

Of course, it's as illogical as the others, since no one on earth gets to choose which gender they will be attracted to.<br>  <br>  All goes back to the middle ages when Europe developed homophobia.

I can't make a hard determination.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think our sexuality is not just 1 thing.  Hardly ANYTHING in humans is.  Therefore I think we don't know.  There are "aspects" of homosexuality that seem to be "choice driven" -- like the details of their particular lifestyle.  Where as, in a larger sense, there are "aspects" which don't seem to be choice at all.  Particularly when you talk to them and they say they "felt" different all their life.  OR they knew at a VERY early age. etc.  The fact that they face ridicule and censorship from society and yet they don't merely "choose" another orientation, both of those facts seem to bolster the idea that it isn't a simple conscience decision on their part. <br>  <br>  SO, I think he COULD Have been referring to different aspects of the same topic when he said that. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  He misspoke<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  He is a Flip-flopper and says whatever fits the situation and has not true point of view on the matter. <br>  <br>  Any 1 of those 3 can be true.|`|fbrdhY1aaa	They do have it both ways, and you're just misunderstanding what they mean.  <br>  <br>  Ehem, let me explain:<br>  <br>  Homosexuals are born the way they are.  They cannot help who they are attracted to.  In this sense, homosexuality is NOT a choice.<br>  <br>  However, you do CHOOSE your mate.  You choose what you do with your body.  You choose to have sex with someone.  You choose to be sinful if you so desire.  In this respect, homosexual acts are choices.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	True. Fortunately there are sane and reasonable xtians out there too. We just don't hear from that many on this site.|`|AA10091424	You have a good point there.<br>  <br>  However, it's possible that the "mental disorder" is in the desire or the tendency, while the "choice" is in the decision and the action.  In other words, I may feel like doing something "weird" or "forbidden", but that's separate from whether or not I choose to act upon my feelings.|`|SavvSFIXaa	They have to treat it like a choice, because if it isn't, that means God made them that way, which means God made people sinful, which goes against the Biblical claim that God made people perfect and people made themselves sinful...human action somehow negating the actions of God.

Men get all sorts of gadgetry to send up to find if there is surely some water or bacteria or anything. Whether there is or not we will doubtless find out some day but when you look at the earth how different it is.<br>  <br>  Even in the places which are desert there is life, everywhere abounds with life in the temperate climates. You don't need a microscope to find much of it. But if you do use a microscope things are teeming with life.<br>  <br>  The LORD God created this world in this way and He sustains it. We are told that if we were to see God we would die for we are mortal.<br>  <br>  The reason that there is death in the world is as a result of the nature of mankind being so rebellious towards God. It was so in the Garden of Eden, when God brought the process of death upon mankind because of sin. We may not like the process but we deserve it because we do not obey God as He would like.<br>  <br>  But, we are given the opportunity to serve Him here and now. If we do so in faith and obedience we will be given eternal life in the grace of God. If we don't want that blessing, and it really is a blessing, then we cannot expect anything from God.<br>  <br>  The Bible presents the picture very clearly. God's chosen people, the Jews, were led by faithful men like Moses, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The people were given choices - obey and there will be blessings, disobey and you will be cursed. You would think it was a simple choice but mankind can be just that bit perverse. They often turned their backs on God and made carved images to bow down and worship and offer their children as sacrifices to.<br>  <br>  These evils separate mankind from God. We may not have gods that we worship as such but there are plenty of things that take us away from God. While we turn our backs on Him how can we expect His help. But Jesus made himself a willing sacrifice for us if we will have faith in God his Father and will be obedient. All we have to do is turn to God and repent and strive to do His will rather than our own.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	I'm sorry but I cant help you.  You do or you dont.

Try to find a friendly church where you are comfortable and welcome. Some are tied up with rituals and are very 'religious'.<br>  <br>  Regarding your q's: <br>  <br>  1. NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM<br>  He can be known through the Holy Spirit God will give you when you put faith in Christ as your Saviour.<br>  <br>  2. Why would he let new born babies die when they havn't even had there first day of life?<br>  We have been given freedom of choice, and nature itself is also not directly controlled by God (currently). Mankind isn't living at the holiness level God is at so there is a disconnect and guilt. The whole world is similarly out of sorts. Those babies' spirits go to heaven of course.<br>  We can start to make things right through becoming united with God in Spirit through faith in christ, but the total righting of the world begins in the future when Christ returns.<br>  <br>  3. HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.<br>  He does when there is faith. You can investighate lives of people who have had very well developed relationships with God, and He does indeed answer prayer. He has answered some of mine.<br>  <br>  4. Why is he slowly letting the world end?<br>  Same as for 2) above. Men have freedom to make choices. Selfishness means problems.<br>  <br>  5.

They were forced to comform and lose this belief when constantine made christianity the religioun of rome, becomming a estranged branch latter knows as the Gnostics. But commonly today it's said to be for eternity. Funny thing though, there's no mention of hell in the entire hebrew bible (new testaments for christians), the jews did not have a concept of hell and jesus, being a jew of the time, did not either, so where did christians get this notion?

God searches our heart and tests our minds to see what our deeds will be, and then gives to us accordingly (Jer 17:10).  Punishment for wickedness, and reward for good deeds.<br>  <br>  The time for God is now.  If you have heard his word and the response from your mind was to believe it and follow it, then repent of your sins and follow God, believing in the sacrifice of Jesus as the atonement for your sins.  If hearing the word of God has no affect on you and no effect in you, then cry out to God for salvation and don't stop until he hears you and saves you or you breathe your last breath.  Read your bible everyday, regardless, and memorize every verse concerning salvation, the rewards, and the warnings.  Pray continually that the God of Heaven will hear you and save you.  Remember the first promise, everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved (Romans 10:13, Acts 2:21, Joel 2:32).|`|NuXv6YLWaa	wow, just wow

ZmdIlkpQaa	Ok, here's the deal...<br>  <br>  You're doing fine of you ask her about her faith and learn what she believes.  IF she asks you to reciprocate and wants to learn about how you see things, then that's great!  BUT, if you start out with the silly assumption that your faith is right and hers is wrong, and you start off by telling her "she had better" come around to believing as you do, then you're not only likely to lose a friend, but you're also in the wrong.  You want to convert other people to believe as you do, then be an example of how your faith makes you a better, more caring, more sensitive, more giving person.  Condemning people who  believe differently than you do is not a good method.  <br>  <br>  I'm 40 years old, have five kids, am a combat veteran and have traveled over a pretty significant part of the globe, and I can tell you that I believe differently than you do, and so do most of the people on the planet.

She has to see the Lord in you before she will be interested in asking about salvation.|`|Jsqlkb3caa	First off..do you know for a fact that your friend is Buddhist? My Grandmother had little statues of Buddha all over the place in her home and garden, but she was not Buddhist. She was a "holy roller" Pentecostal. She just really liked the little Buddha statues. Maybe your friend just likes Buddha. You may want to think about that first before you jump to conclusions.  <br>  Secondly, I am sure that your friend has heard all about Jesus, and Christianity. Very few people in this world have not. It is her choice to pick whatever religion (nor no religion at all) she wants. Preaching to your friend would be a really bad idea. But I do suggest you try to learn about her beliefs. Ask her to explain to you what she believes in, just remember to be respectful. This way, you will learn about your friend, her religion and maybe gain a better understanding of the diversity of the world around you. If she asks you about your religion, then by all means, answer! But don't push it on her. I am assuming that you are still pretty young by the tone of your post. As you go through life you will meet many many people of different religions, cultures..all walks of life. It would benefit you to start right now learning, opening your eyes to the differences, and learning to be tolerant. You don't have to share a religion to be friends with someone. You don't have to be part of a religion to understand, and respect it. The religions of the world are an amazingly interesting topic. You can learn a lot about a person by knowing who and how they worship. Just remember this...you were her friend before, and she has not changed. She is still the same person she was before.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	you have a choice to make. are you going to be a human being and a real friend? or are you going to be a nut who can't deal with other people?<br>  <br>  your truth is not THE truth. each person has their religion and they have the right to believe what they want. it's not your job to turn the world christian. if you do, you will quickly find yourself losing friends. do you really only want to be friends with people who think like you do? life is not fun that way, and you can't learn anything.<br>  and no one knows the rules about heaven, so don't start to speak for god or think you know what he's thinking.<br>  <br>  you have an opportunity to be a real friend, to talk to her about what she believes without putting down her beliefs or trying to change her mind.<br>  <br>  learn about her religion, but don't assume yours is right and don't try to change her mind.  talk to her about yours without having to prove that yours is right and hers is wrong. can you do that? i think you can!|`|4BPYNiKVaa	Matthew 7:20 "So then, you will know them by their fruits, have faith in the LORD he opens his heaven to every one , there is no cop on the gates of heaven checking the religion of those who enter!

gm9QYLjIaa	"aww you're a dear I love you so much (It's most likely about friendship, it's very common in Turkey to say I love you to people you care about or even just like, call them canim, cicim, kuzum, hayatim)<br>  <br>  I like living cheerfully but he's not really like that you know... let him feel secure, calm, happy, comfortable... it's not wrong, just different... right now I'm trying to understand the difference between love and break-up pain. Maybe it's because I don't know what I want. Maybe if we could erase everything and start from scratch, meeting each other now... what a shitty situation.<br>  <br>  I told him that I went out tonight. Why can't we just have fun together? I've also lied to him fearing that he might misunderstand, shouldn't I feel comfortable... it's better to be two independent people who are together. I guess we felt that we owned each other. That's why it's not great anymore and it's become monotonous.. let me think a little bit more, let me be with myself a little bit. Life is so precious dude, I don't want to miss out on anything. I want to live everywhere and know everyone. And that just doesn't work out when you're with someone. You know it's different here... <br>  <br>  Sweetheart, I need to rant, I wish we could talk face to face. Then we could have silly conversations and I'd start to annoy you. <br>  <br>  Dear worst of all is that I'm not afraid of being alone and I'm not letting anyone be around me. When I get mad I walk out immediately. I meet with people superficially. It's like it doesn't matter for me to have any friends anymore, I'm becoming savage roarrr :)) I guess I'm acting  like that too. <br>  <br>  The different culture thing is a must for everyone in my opinion, Tolgi (a diminutif of Tolga). But if you come here maybe you're going to adapt again and what I'm telling you will seem normal to you. There are a lot of morons it's hard not to have confidence in oneself, we're great ;P we're right and we're strong<br>  <br>  if it's like that now I wonder what going to happen after the marriage. I don't know how my brother and her wife turned out like that, it's great. They're both "can ciger kuzu sarmasi" (It's a Turkish expression  meaning they're inseparable, I don't know how to translate that). I do hate that expression. <br>  <br>  I think that men and women aren't different at all it's just their egos and complexes that makes things turn wrong. <br>  <br>  Marry her already, you'd get a citizenship too, what are you waiting for. And then come and visit. "<br>  <br>  Wow what a boring mail, she's just complaining about her own relationship. There are some parts that are loose since I don't know what your husband wrote to her, but everything should be right. I hope she was at least nice to you, she seems annoying, but she also seems to be a very close friend of your husband's so I guess you'll have to endure her from time to time. (Unless I'm mistaken)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

Dead is dead. There is no "soul" that goes out of the body to live elsewhere! No "soul" goes immediately to heaven or hell. Dead is dead!<br>  “For as the body without the spirit is dead, . .” [James2.26]<br>  <br>  The Sleep of Death.<br>  <br>  At death the body returns to dust and the life force (not the soul) to the creator<br>  “ . . . but the dead know not any thing, .” [Ecclesiastes 9.5]<br>  “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” [Psalm 146.4]<br>  Lazarus was dead four days, yet he gave no report of any “life after death” experience. (refer John 11.39)<br>  The Bible uses “sleep” as a figure of speech for death.<br>  Jesus said: “. . . Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; . . “ [John 11.11]<br>  David prayed “Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;” [Psalm 13.3]<br>  “And they stoned Stephen, . . . Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.“ [Acts 7.59-60]<br>  “. . . the fathers fell asleep, . . “ [2 Peter 3.4]<br>  <br>  “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: “ [Hebrews 9:27]<br>  <br>  The Hope of Resurrection – “Awake and Sing”<br>  <br>  Death is NOT the end. There is hope.  As there is a falling asleep, there is a waking up.<br>  <br>  “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: . . .” [Isaiah 26.19]<br>  “ . . . them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake . . . “ [Daniel 12.2]<br>  The next event that everyone will experience will be the resurrection, as John says, to face the results of his judgment.<br>  “And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. “ [John 5:29]<br>  Jesus said: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:” [John 11.25]<br>  <br>  What does it mean to “believe in Jesus”? – <br>  To believe that He is the ONLY source of resurrection life; that He paid the penalty for all of our sins when He dies on the cross and by His resurrection made possible our resurrection to eternal life; then by prayer we can invite Jesus into our lives and experience His resurrection power for daily living.<br>  <br>  The best way you can prepare for death is to get to know Jesus right now by prayer and Bible reading. You could pray this prayer right now –<br>  <br>  Father God in heaven, I am a sinner and I need your forgiveness; I believe that Jesus died for my sins; I want to turn from my sins; I invite Jesus into my heart and life. I want to trust Jesus as my Saviour, and to follow you as my Lord in the company of your Church; Lord please accept my prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|tuULGJS6aa	Death is final, so individual consciousness ends with the termination of life processes.

No more and no less.|`|qpmGLd7laa	If you believe in God and divine creation.  How did God happen.  Surely it couldn't have come from nothing.  Please use question marks next time.|`|lXu5cJd1aa	Evolution did not happen by accident. First of all, if you do not already know, evolution has nothing to do with how life began. So, there are organisms. A small percentage of them mutate. If the genetic mutation helps the creature in any way to reproduce or survive and can be passed down to offspring, then the part of the species that has the mutation will survive longer and reproduce more. Over time, the entire species has the mutation. We have plenty of evidence to show that this happens with no evidence against. The theory of evolution by natural selection has been proven and is widely accepted by most scientists and religions including the catholic church. <br>  <br>  The big bang however, has not been absolutely proven and has plenty of evidence for it. We can only hypothesize what it was like before it happened, or even when it happened. Our universe was in a small, hot, dense state. Then it rapidly expanded outwards. Our universe is still moving outwards. I'm not a biologist or an astronomer or physicist or anything, but as far as I know those are the basics of evolution and the big bang.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  Evolution is not an "accident", much as the Creationists would like to think so. It's an observable scientific fact; the only people who seriously reject it don't actually understand it.<br>  <br>  As for the Big Bang, no one knows exactly what "caused" the Big Bang, though a few hypotheses have been proposed (look up Brane Theory if you like). It's possible we'll never know for sure.<br>  <br>  The fact that we don't know these things does not damage the credibility of these theories. I have never fully understood why religious people think that the fact that there is not yet a scientific explanation for something means that there will never be one.<br>  <br>  Again: the fact that we don't know the answers to these question is not evidence that some supernatural deity was responsible. There is no observable evidence to support that concept.|`|AA11297267	You say, "Surely it couldn't happen by accident" as if you know that to be a fact.  Do you?  If so, can you please offer the evidence that supports your contention that it's a fact?  'Cause there isn't any that I'm aware of.<br>  <br>  "Accident" sounds, especially as you've used it, like a negative term.  "Chance" would be more appropriate.  But even then we don't have enough to go on to know for sure.<br>  <br>  See, since we really only know that life arose by all natural causes and then evolved on this one planet that we live on, we have no idea how often it happens on other planets.  The initial "event" of living things arising from non-living matter could be extremely common, and happen pretty much every time conditions allow it to.  On the other hand, it could be very rare -- and life on our planet could be one out of only a few others or even the only one.  With a sample size of 1 (which is what we have now), we can't know how rare or common it is.  <br>  <br>  As for the Big Bang...we don't know yet.  It could be one event in a cycle of such events.  It could be a common occurrence and there might be a "multiverse" out there with thousands of independent universes.  We don't know enough yet to answer that question with anything other than guesses.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, though:  saying we don't know just means we don't know.  It doesn't mean "god did it."  If you want to suggest that god did it, you have to offer evidence to *show* that god did it -- that idea doesn't just win by default because we don't know.  There's no evidence to support the notion of any god having anything to do with either of those events -- so until there is, there's no reason to accept that any god had anything to do with either of them.<br>  Less than 100 years ago, we didn't know the size of the universe, that there was a Big Bang, or nearly as much as we do about evolution today.  Give us another 100 years of research, and we'll probably have some pretty good answers to what we currently don't know.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I'm not a scientist. I really don't care. I find evolution likely, and Big Bang possible. But I don't really care that much. And science is a puzzle, the parts are never found all at once.<br>  <br>  All I know is that how ever it happened, either by those means or not, it certainly was not some invisible magic being because that concept is just ridiculous.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	I'd explain the current models for the Big Bang, but I doubt you'd have the math to understand them. What we know is that there was a singularity that somehow became unstable and expanded rapidly.<br>  <br>  Evolution? Of course it happens by chance!|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I think we are still investigating these questions so its premature to say. I think the religious answers are just made up and lack any credible evidence. I think a naturalistic explanation more likely. For example, the Big Bang or singularity may have been caused by a quantum fluctuation, this doesn't require a supernatural agency. Abiogenesis is also something we can't honestly say. God did it is not an honest answer either without any factual support. Simple organic molecules combining according to their chemical properties are the basic units of life.|`|UWKF7x4faa	Eternal multiverse|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Why do you people always ask this?

We do not know the answer to that yet and we may never truly know.  Second, how did life first begin?  We do not know conclusively how life first began.  There are theories, but nothing has been proven yet.<br>  <br>  What is great about science is that it can be tested, observations can be made, and theories postulated.<br>  <br>  But, like I stated some answers may never be known.  If you are speaking about religion, I would say that God is not the required answer.  You can choose that as your answer if you really need an answer.  But, to me that is the easy way out...|`|yHfsHp6naa	It's turtles all the way down.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	I don't know any reason why it couldn't happen by accident, but "accident" has a conotation that I wouldn't use.<br>  <br>  If I flip a coin and it comes up heads I wouldn't call it an accident.

The explaination of the origin of the universe can have infinite other possibilities besides God even if our limited human minds cannot think of any other explaination that does not mean that no other explanation exists.<br>  <br>  -Your second major flaw is that by God you obviously are referring to the Christian God.  How on earth do you go from needing a creator to assuming that it is your creator out of all the thousands of possible Gods out there.  This is a huge leap of faith.<br>  <br>  -Your third flaw is that you assume that if science can explain the origin of the universe then it must do so already or else it is flawed.  But science is an adaptive and revisible study.  What ever the origin of the universe turns out to be, science will still be used to explain it because everything needs an explaination even God.  By assuming that god created the universe, not only are you not looking for an answer but you are creating one that cannot be explained.<br>  <br>  -Based on your logic, the idea that God created something and that he is unexplainable is not an answer to the origin of the universe at all.  It is simply replacing the question mark of the universe with an even bigger question mark that does not deserve an answer.|`|BVVvb8Ieaa	Scientists have long known that matter can be converted to energy and, conversely, energy can be converted to matter. In 1905 physicist Albert Einstein quantified the relationship between matter and energy in his famous equation e=mc2, in which E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light (300,000 km/sec [186,000 mi/sec]).<br>  <br>  And to bring the point home Physicists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California have succeeded in producing particles of matter from very energetic collisions of light.

You might try contacting the Navajo nation directly and asking for a referral to a medicine man and talk it over. They have almost sixty sacred rituals, including the protection ceremonies they can perform, but I understand that most of these last several days, require you, your friends and family to be physically present, have to be conducted on Navajo land, and you're going to have to convince them that your need is genuine (And that they should give a damn and not write you off as a kook.

It's a con, a misinterpretation of your experience, a psychosis or hysteria of some sort, maybe even an intentional fraud by someone taking advantage of your credulity, but it's never anything supernatural. If it's something physical, physical countermeasures will stop it. If it's psychological, Zoloft will make it go away.

Apply them to mental experiments on prisoners.  Apply them to toxic research on animals.  After all, those are scientific experiments, and if you object, it must be your ideology that's getting in the way, not your love of scientific discovery.<br>  <br>  I think what Obama and the unthinking masses that support him in this policy really mean is "we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideologies that we personally disagree with."<br>  <br>  Critical thinking:  Still free, but still in short supply.|`|bYkXMGBHaa	As a Christian, it is my opinion that our government officials lost their way when they voted and allowed immorality as law.

That doesn't mean that I'm less, because I probably have strengths that they don't.  This is true of everyone.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong: some people are absolutely evil.  They are born with the potential to be good, but make themselves bad, and have bad influences too, usually.<br>  <br>  But, except for the bad choices that we make, we all start out as equals.|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Absolutely not. We are born as individuals that each has a purpose in life. Some as great as the difference in the sexes (a woman gives birth) to the simplest of differences of how we communicate.Some are born  to Royalty and others ascend to it because of their faith( King David). Some are born poor and gain riches through inventive means, hard work and savings. Others are born rich and through reckless behavior becomes poor. God designed each trait in us to be specific to who we are. We show our ability to conform those traits to honor or deny GOD.<br>   I believe we all should have the ability to witness to GOD in our own way but that is not so either.<br>   GOD is denied in any countries today and others have forced doctrines on the people.<br>   In no way are any of mankind totally equal.|`|THRtsl83aa	No.  Would you say someone who is mentally retarded is equal to someone like Bill Gates or Einstein?

How useful a person is depends on the society in which they are born.  Now we make much of some traits, such as academic or entertainments skills.

If a 7 year old can "accept Jesus and get saved" why not decide for themselves to be confirmed at 12-14 yrs old? <br>  <br>  And the poster who says confirmation is not biblical lies yet again..<br>  <br>  The sacrament of confirmation is found in Bible passages such as Acts 8:14–17, 9:17, 19:6, and Hebrews 6:2, which speak of a laying on of hands for the purpose of bestowing the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Hebrews 6:2 is especially important because it is not a narrative account of how confirmation was given and, thus, cannot be dismissed by those who reject the sacrament as something unique to the apostolic age. In fact, the passage refers to confirmation as one of Christianity’s basic teachings, which is to be expected since confirmation, like baptism, is a sacrament of initiation into the Christian life. <br>  <br>  We read: "Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment" (Heb. 6:1–2). <br>  <br>  Notice how in this passage we are walked through the successive stages of the Christian journey—repentance, faith, baptism, confirmation, resurrection, and judgment. This passage encapsulates the Christian’s journey toward heaven and gives what theologians call the order of salvation or the ordo salutis. It well qualifies as "the elementary teachings" of the Christian faith. <br>  <br>  The laying on of hands mentioned in the passage must be confirmation: The other kinds of the imposition of hands (for ordination and for healing) are not done to each and every Christian and scarcely qualify as part of the order of salvation. <br>  <br>  As the following passages show, the Church Fathers and early Christian writers also recognized confirmation as a sacrament distinct from baptism, even though it was usually given simultaneously with baptism. Their words speak powerfully about this anointing and imposition of hands for reception of the Holy Spirit and the role it has in Christian initiation.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	A person of any age should get confirmed when he/she wants to complete his/her initiation into the Christian Church. It starts with baptism and ends with confirmation.<br>  <br>  Biblical support for confirmation:<br>  <br>  We read in the Acts of the Apostles (8:14-17) that after the Samaritan converts had been baptized by Philip the deacon, the Apostles "sent unto them Peter and John, who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost; for he was not yet come upon any of them, but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus; then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost".<br>  <br>  Again (19:1-6): St. Paul "came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples; and he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost. And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism. Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance . . . Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied". <br>  <br>  So, baptism in one Sacrament, receipt of the Holy Spirit in a separate one (though they can be performed one after another without delay if need be). <br>  <br>  Chris is an unreliable source of information about ANY form of Christianity. He's made up his own church because he can't seem to work well with any denomination. He thinks 95% of Christians are going to hell because they don't agree with him, and he fails to use Biblical support for his own theology.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	For the simple fact that it's part of the hypnotism.

AA11923447	I wanted to undergo Confirmation because I thought it was a highly meaningful way to take a further step in my religion. I was raised in a devoutly Catholic home, and had no input in the matter. But Confirmation was my own personal choice. I made a conscious decision to remain in the church in which I was raised. It's about being entrusted by your church and your religious community to make an adult decision, rather than having choices made for you by others. How could being regarded as worthy of making such an important decision *not* be appealing to a young person? Also, in my denomination, people take Confirmation names. Many people very much enjoyed the process of learning about the saint whose name they took.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

This has become a patterning story for self-sacrifice in the Mahayana world, probably providing the inspiration for the auto-cremation of the Vietnamese monk Thich Quang Duc during the 1960s, as well as several other incidents."|`|AA12059478	I have to agree with Mark.<br>  I am a Tibetan Buddhist (RIME) and I have never heard of such a thing.<br>  It goes against the precept of causing no harm.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	I have not heard of anything like that... very strange.<br>  Ask him what school he is in.

AA11690436	You mean a connection between ripping the beating hearts out of defeated enemies' chests and their ability to build nice pyramids and have indoor plumbing?  I'm thinking not so much.|`|AA11058044	Actually, there was.  The Aztecs excelled at a form of flintknapping in which they would do considerable work to form a spindle-like core of obsidian.<br>  <br>  Archaeologists were puzzled by these cores for a long time, because they obviously took a lot of work to manufacture, but didn't have any obvious use.<br>  <br>  Eventually, someone discovered that if you took one of the long, wooden "crutches" they also had from many Aztec sites, and pushed down on the edge of the core with it after placing the crutch's pad in the center of your chest, you could easily flake off very long, nearly perfect razor sharp obsidian knife blades from all around the core.  Once formed, each core could produce dozens or even hundreds of high quality blades - one for every push with the crutch.<br>  <br>  These incredibly keen blades were used by the Aztecs in a variety of human sacrifice ceremonies, including cutting the hearts out of living victims, or flensing the skin off of someone in one piece - which was then worn for a week or more by the priest as part of their fertility ceremonies.|`|QVO9b0a8aa	No. While Aztec religion was based around pseudo-astronomy, their "technological" advancements usually were made out of crude wood and stone, so no.|`|hiCSVwchaa	*bangs head against wall*|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Do your homework...|`|pfNnuD5saa	Not really.

With out TRUTH there is no morals and once morality is gone, then killing another man, becomes easy and nothing matter's because there is no hope !|`|86PUxs1jaa	Everyone is different.  My immediate family, three insane Pentecostals, literally drove me to atheism.  Most people presume a child will willingly accept their parent's religious views.  That's not always the case, especially when parents are such Fundy extremists that their child is deeply humiliated and embarrassed by their behavior.  I never once brought a friend home from school because I didn't want any of my peers to know the sort of superstitious fools I had for parents.  <br>  <br>  You should also know that religion has nothing to do with morals.  Human beings are inherently moral because we are social animals and our success within our peer group greatly depends on demonstrating acceptable social behavior.  Beyond simple instinct, that's what we have a criminal justice system for -- regulating our behavior.  The assertion that atheists are immoral is utterly false -- a damn lie generally perpetrated by superstitious bigots.
0FDlNeHAaa	Hello - <br>  <br>  Firstly, I think you mean Henry VIII (8).<br>  <br>  The short answer is Henry thought his marriage was cursed.  <br>  <br>  The longer answer: A string of dead babies led him to wonder what he had done to deserve such tragedy.  Since Henry had at least two boys from his mistresses (Henry Fitzroy from Elizabeth Blount and and Henry Stafford via Mary Stafford) it was natural for him to wonder what was wrong with his queen - Katharine of Aragon.<br>  <br>  Katherine was Henry's brother's widow. Arthur Tudor had died in his teens, so Henry's father (at the time, King Henry VII) decided that Henry should marry Katherine. Young Henry wasn't to happy getting "sullied seconds" but you didn't cross Henry VII.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note that the pope at that time was Julian II (The Warrior Pope). He was uncomfortable in granting the dispensation that was necessary for Henry to marry Katherine legally. The pope delayed for a year and then Katherine's mother, Queen Isabella of Spain, pressured the pope into agreeing to the dispensation (Spain was a very powerful neighbour of the pope - they had immense influence in Italy at the time).<br>  <br>  Fast forward to the 1530's: Henry is getting older, and still no legitimate son. He begins to worry (as do many of his advisers and nobles) that without a son, England will fall into civil war at Henry's death. <br>  <br>  Remember that England had only emerged from the Wars of Roses when Henry VII defeated Richard III at Bosworth in 1485 - the spectre of these wars haunted the English upper class much like Viet Nam haunted Americans for a generation.<br>  <br>  So, Henry meets Anne Boleyn, who plays hard to get (which drives men crazy) and promises him a son. Most of us should know the result - she fails and loses her head for it.<br>  <br>  The common element in Henry's case is always A SON. He's remarkably consistent in this pursuit, and woe betide anyone who stands in his way.<br>  <br>  The Church of England:<br>  What may come as a surprise to many readers is that the Church of England maintained they had not been founded as a Roman Church, but had been started by Joseph of Arimathea shortly after the Death of Christ - this was Medieval Tradition in a time when it was hard to check sources. <br>  <br>  On top of the English claim to Joseph was the more concrete claim that the English Church had been established prior to the Council of Nicea in 325 CE (an arbitrary date that most agreed marked the formal coming together of Christians and the birth of the Church of Rome).<br>  <br>  Certainly the British Church had sent the Bishop of London to the Council of Arles in 314 CE, so they claimed eleven years seniority. This British Church is often called The Culdee Church or The Celtic Church.<br>  <br>  It was this claim that made it possible for English jurists to maintain that they were legally under no obligation to Rome. With the momentum of the Reformation behind them, the break with Rome was accomplished by several Acts of Parliament.<br>  <br>  Henry's Church of England was remarkably similar to the Roman church in practise, use and theology. When he died, the regents for his son, Edward VI (Jane Seymour's boy) reformed the English church with much German, Dutch and Swiss Reformation theology.<br>  <br>  The man who REALLY formed the Anglican Church as we know it was Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. He wrote the first Book of Common Prayer, various versions of which is still in use throughout the Anglican world. Cranmer was the leading figure in "Protestantizing" the Church of England.<br>  <br>  Whew!  I hope this helps.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Cause he wanted a divorce|`|DzGKfdKnaa	He wanted to annul from Catherine even though he had no grounds. She kept having stillborns and only one daughter when he wanted a son. Anne promised him a son.|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	Henry VIII is who you're thinking of.<br>  <br>  It wasn't him who formed the Anglican church, he just broke with the Catholic Church.  His daughter, Elizabeth 1, formed the Anglican church.<br>  <br>  She formed it because after her father, Henry VIII died, her  brother Edward (a child) gained the throne and his advisors made the country protestant and persecuted Catholics.  Then when he died, their sister Mary inherited the throne, and brought the country back to Catholicism, and persecuted Protestants. Then when she died in order to try and bring a political solution to the different religious factions and stability to the country, Elizabeth created a church in which you could still worship in the old catholic way, or you could worship in the new protestant way.  This was called the Church of England.  Instead of persecuting Catholics for being catholic, she declared that all Catholics were traitors and executed them for being traitors.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	It was Henry VIII, not Henry VII. He wanted to dump his wife for another woman. The only way he could do this was to declare himself the head of the Church in England.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	He didn't.<br>  The Church of England existed as part of the catholic church already, he just asserted his authority over it above that of te Popes.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	To obtain a divorce from his first wife in order to marry Anne Boleyn.<br>  <br>  Edit- My bad.

n9IHOYLuaa	Hello sir,<br>  I am once again answering a question that you have asked multiple times. Do you ever get tired of asking the same questions over and over again? <br>  Here is my answer to your question, once again:<br>  <br>  What makes you think that "black people" equate being nice with **** kissing? You've only given one example of this occurring, that's hardly reason for your sweeping generalization. Did you know that there are about 6 billion people in the world? Do you think it's reasonable to say that all people who share a darker skin color think and act the same? One person exhibiting a behavior is no reason to believe that another person, vaguely similar in appearance, will do the same.<br>  Do you trust anyone? just curious.......<br>  Your question is ridiculous as usual and you will probably be angry with my answer, as I have disagreed with you.|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	I don't think this is any one culture at all, I think your dealing with a socitey filled with rude people.  You might live in an area of that has more black people so it SEEMS like it's black people not trusting people.  really, people are people, we are all rude at times and alot of people ALL races have trust issues...go to a red neck white town without a black person in sight...they may not specifically say your an *** kisser but you sure will find someone rude...just don't classify it to one race and don't stop bieng yourself because of what people say.  it's not a** kissing to be polite.|`|7ZqSiZqUaa	if i knew what the  *** stood for, i might have a better chance of answering this question<br>  <br>  i'm assuming that there are three letters in the word,since you use three asterisks, and i can't think of anything that'd fit - oh, i just remembered that Americans spell "****" with three letter, don't they?  is that what you maent?|`|bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	Well not me some black people are decent than others|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	Try to look a little broader out into the crowd!|`|snVqB2rVaa	This is not true at all of black people.

iLFYj6Qgaa	Just a few alterations are needed:<br>  <br>  * La nourriture (no comma!) est bonne ici ...<br>  * Nous mangeons pendant quarante-cinq minutes.<br>  -> for this sentence, it would be better to say: Nous avons quarante-cinq minutes pour manger. Or: Notre pause de midi dure quarante-cinq minutes. (Otherwise it sounds like you are eating during the whole 45 minutes.)<br>  * pas cours le samedi<br>  <br>  The rest is fine!|`|gTVVz7Ljaa	No, unfurtunatelly is doen not make any sense; reazon why it is called a fragment sentence.

AA11923447	The invasion, of course. On the other hand, I support scientific advancement, and that includes stem cell research. Not all Christians oppose stem cell research, and many are horrified by both Bushes and their legacy.|`|AA10249608	President Bush protected us,obama will see us destroyed,one way or another.I see every move he makes as devastating,including putting the clinton back in power.|`|VYWaL2graa	I don't have a problem with either. Not sure what you mean by condoning torture or disregarding due process, since that didn't happen.<br>  <br>  Here's a question for you. <br>  <br>  Long haired hippies, what did you get more enjoyment out of?<br>  <br>  Watching the Twin towers fall to the ground or giggling in glee everytime a soldier died in Iraq so you could use their death to further your own agenda?|`|wSYYfBK4aa	"Pro-Life" is only "Pro-Embryo."  Once they're born, especially if they're born in another country, it's totally cool to drop bombs on them.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	Bush's failed colonization of Iraq|`|K24JFTOcaa	well, stem cells aren't trying to blow us up so......<br>  <br>  the 'torture' is highly questionable<br>  <br>  terrorists should not have due process, their not soldiers|`|ddea8dbfe02911fd00f96bb107edf2ffaa	As a Christian who believes and have faith in Jesus, I am totally against anything contrary to the will of God. The Gospel of Jesus is about enduring suffering. Likewise it does not give any man the right to alter the course of human life. But who am I to judge, I'll leave that to God.|`|YmqFqbNRaa	bush invading iraq. i mean honestly when the u.s had our civil war did other countrys come in and try to tell us how to run our own country? no they let us be i mean i understood at first going there to find the terrorist but now theyre just their sayign they ened to help the governement and their killing innocent people and pedestrians!<br>  thbe iraqians freakin bomb our us soldiers! dont the soldiers get it! they dont want us there! the u.s is being like hitler and forcing themselves upon iraq and killing innocent people!
THezIGOiaa	Put new curtains up.<br>  <br>  Change your lock (if you feel that it's necessary)<br>  <br>  Shower in the dark (if you feel that it's necessary)|`|PJzrBkpEaa	Report him to the cops ..|`|1LZdc4K5aa	Lol, you sound like your liying. If you aren't, then just have a set of binoculars ready when you shower and look right back at him.|`|RMsHTePVaa	If your truly concerned report him to the police. If not then charge him for the peep show. Economy is bad do everything to make a few bucks..lol
UPMdxJj5aa	The book that really helped me was "Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish" by Margarita Madrigal. It is an older book, but the exercises in it really helped me when i first started learning. Just actually FOLLOW what the book outlines and it will help a lot with verbs and reflexive pronouns. <br>  <br>  But you might prefer a program with recordings too so you can be 100% sure of the pronunciation and imitate it. In that case I would recommend Pimsleur's.|`|280PZZA9aa	One of the best books for learning verbs and pronouns is the Practice Makes Perfect series.  It gives clear explanations and there are lots of practice pages.  The answers are in the back of the books and you can check your answers...just be sure and not cheat by looking before you write your answers.  I required them of my Spanish students several years ago. Check them out at amazon.com.|`|R1OfYW6Yaa	try this method to learn Spanish.|`|bd5c7de49b15ec5ce776bd359797a407aa	Try this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mansionspanish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mansionspanish.com</a><br>  .

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	People who have hearing problems will almost always have a special phone that displays a running transcript of the conversation. The phone automatically connects to a transcriber/operator when someone picks it up; the transcriber/operator then puts them through to the person they want to call, and starts typing everything that is said.<br>  <br>  If they don't have such a phone, no doubt the person would send a reply saying "Um, I'm deaf. Can you please drop by in person, or arrange an interview instead?"|`|qnU1HS1aaa	Thats messed up

BevylvVSaa	No. Depending on what their license is they could be reported and have their license suspended or removed.  In some cases there would be criminal charges. <br>  <br>  This is a link to various code of ethics (social work, psychology, counseling, etc.):<br>  <a href="http://kspope.com/ethcodes/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://kspope.com/ethcodes/index.php</a>|`|8c3928ce39cd98e96b5b55afe6bfec47aa	OMG NO!<br>  <br>  The supervisor and care worker has a duty of care to protect the person from any from of abuse, they also have a ethical and moral obligation to not engage in any physical relationship etc with a client. <br>  <br>  Also this would be a serious breech of workplace polices & procedures, which are clearly defined, about relationships etc between workers and clients, regardless of what country one is in. <br>  <br>  Does it violate anything?<br>  Yes the clients rights to be protected on all aspects of their care. <br>  For the staff member it violates the workplace polices & procedures, and their professional conduct and ethics.|`|WjRqYf6naa	It's not acceptable at all. The supervisor has a duty to protect the person they are supervising and not abuse them. A sexual relationship would be morally and legally wrong.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	it could be considered sexual assault--even if it is 'consensual' if teh person is determined not to have the ability to consent|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	In most states it's treated as rape. Here it's treated as fifteen years in prison.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	no|`|n7WN8g7taa	I do not think that a supervisor/superior should be having sex with anyone under his supervision, whether the person under him is disabled or not. There is an unfair distribution of power in such a relationship, which can easily be abused. That's why teachers do not have relationships with their students, or policeman with their charges, or a doctor with his patient, etc, etc....|`|yCUOXInFaa	Definately not acceptable behaviour, its called abuse of power, and would breach ethical standards.|`|QMzsM2fkaa	You could but it'd be remarkably unethical.  You could kiss your job - and prospects for a future job - goodbye!|`|lijNJznEaa	I'm kinda guessing that its wrong, coz they're taking advantage of the PWD's
6NNpGROxaa	They are all the same. <br>  <br>  They all don't want you to kill.<br>  All of them are promised the holy land, by the dead sea.<br>  <br>  The torah is the first half of the bible.<br>  <br>  They all have their version of the ten commandments.<br>  <br>  They all promise salvation.<br>  <br>  I honestly think that they are the exact same religion, but just got lost in translation over the centuries.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: you already have 8, trying to find 10 would be pushing it.  Do your own homework!  The three religions aren't that similar|`|ws0nvFi5aa	1. They all believe that there is only one God. <br>  <br>  2. Believe that God is the origin and source of all that exists. <br>  <br>  3. Have belief that people are the ones who have high authority over all the other creatures. <br>  <br>  4. All 3 religions say that Moses was the prophet of God|`|5GL2eFhyaa	They believe in the same god of abraham<br>  <br>  They believe men have the authority<br>  <br>  They technically should be Pro-Life<br>  <br>  They all say 'Worship no other god but ours'<br>  <br>  They all originated in the Middle east<br>  <br>  Each one has a problem with the other. Sort of like 'Rock paper scissors'|`|FOzN3xwzaa	None. <br>  <br>  The truth is that Jesus is God.  But Islam rejects this truth, therefore Islam has a different and fake "god" that cannot save anyone from beign sent to hell. <br>  <br>  Only believing in the true Jesus saves.|`|AA11336384	1) God.

AA11767291	Yes. It re-enforces many ways to improve ones well-being and create abundance in all things. It is nothing new ; it goes back hundreds of years. it has just been formatted in a newer original version to open the eyes of those who will not see. It has helped me actualize many things.|`|AA11850523	the "secret" isnt much of a secret<br>  its called self esteem and positive thinking <br>  <br>  has a positive attitude helped me? always|`|dPsaYMOvaa	No, I do not use 'The Secret'.
