While Psychologists and Psychiatrists both share common roots, work in similar environments, and have comparable day to day duties, there are many profound differences between these two often confused professions.       The ancient Greeks and Romans considered psychological problems to be supernatural. Hindu scriptures known as Ramayana, and Mahabharata, describes illnesses of the mind arising from an imbalance of bodily fluids. The Chinese attached the afflicted with an imbalance of Ying and Yang. Each and every culture with the ability to display beliefs in a form of writing, reported a perception of mental illness. It was only a matter of time before the study of the mind became scientific. Psychologists today believe that mental illness is caused by life stresses and maladaptive behavior patterns. Whereas psychiatrists understand the disturbed mind to be of biological in origin. Both seek to understand and treat the unfortunate victims of the mental disorders that has taken hold of so many lives.       To better understand the perception and treatment of each field of study, one must understand the education, philosophy and the foundation of both professions. A psychologist, usually requires either a Ph.D or Psy.D to practice independently. A psychiatrist on the other hand, must acquire a medical degree before pursuing an education in mental health. This is coupled with at least four years of residency; a minimum of three of those four years must be in the mental health field. Possession of a medical degree allows a psychiatrist to administer a variety of medical tests, prescribe medication, and supervise electrotherapy treatments whereas a psychologist cannot. Both do however follow the same law of ethics, and provide similar duties such as educating students in the understanding the mind, conducting research, and, providing psychotherapy sessions. Some of the common places to see a psychologist or psychiatrist are hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, schools, prisons, rehabilitation centers, military settings, and also private practices. Both often work in a collaborative environment as team players to enhance diagnostic abilities, and improve treatment strategy.       The two professions also work individually. A psychologist mainly treats patients who are struggling with life issues. They may help someone adjust to life after being incarcerated, aid a family in the loss of a loved one, help children process the divorce of their parents, a veteran cope with the amputation of his limbs, or perhaps offer guidance to a confused adolescent. A psychiatrist can also do all of the same things, and can offer additional help due to the fact he/she is a physician. For example, patients suffering from schizophrenia may choose the aid of a psychiatrist rather than just a psychologist. This would be beneficial in order to receive medication and therapy from a single source to suppress the voices and delusions in their mind. Though the approach for treatment can be very different, the objective is always the same, both are in a position of service to aid in the quality of life to any given individual.      It is easy to see why these two valued occupations are commonly intertwined as being the same, but there are a number of other differences between the two. For instance, Psychologist and psychiatrists earn substantially different amounts of money. Psychiatrists procure an astounding average of $180,000.00 annually, while a psychologist doesn’t earn half that amount at a mere $59,440.00 per year. Another notable difference is that fifty percent of psychiatrists chose to maintain private practices, whilst a psychologist is more likely to work within an organization.      Many years of sweat and tears have of gone into the experimentation and research needed to further the understanding of the human mind. These two accomplices of service, work together, and individually, to aid our society through times of catastrophe and hardship. They are educated extensively, share common goals of assistance, and make significant changes in the lives of the unfortunate individuals who need the aid of these two professions so desperately. In order to care for a patient fully, both of these Samaritans are needed for their individual perceptions and treatments.

For one of my classes we have to find how teachers would react to these situations. What would you do? How would you react?      1. You are in your first year of teaching in a high school. You ask a student to do something which is reasonable and his response is that he does not have to listen to some teenager.       2. Shawn, who is a very hard worker, does not have his homework done because he forget his books at school. This is the first time he has not completed his work.
20090227094733AA5UCqa	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	If your college schoolmates called you ugly should you allow it to affect you?	My friend is away at college and she wants to leave school and transfer to a college here in the state where we live because she says that the students at her school are constantly refering to her as being ugly.      She has dealt with this exact same thing in high school.  I thought that college would be alot different and that she wouldn't have to go through this again.  I though that the students in college would be alot more mature and would be more focused on getting an education instead of concentrating so much on others look and the type of clothing that they wear.  There is no reason for my friend to have to deal with this.  She is a nice person and she doesn't bother anyone and i feel that others should not bother her either.  I hate to see go through this.  My question to you is would you allow this to affect you?

20090227094144AAM6nzd	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Please help, Literature test, Please help.?	3. Cassius is intent on persuading Brutus to join the conspiracy because (Points: 3)           as an ambitious man, Brutus is willing to kill to get power.            as a greatly respected Roman, Brutus will bring credibility to the conspiracy.            as an experienced assassin, Brutus can help the conspirators to achieve their goal.            as Caesar’s friend, Brutus can get the conspirators inside Caesar’s home to carry out their plot.          4. What is the function of these events in the play: the Soothsayer’s warning, the strange sightings and the earthquake in Rome, and Calpurnia’s dream? (Points: 3)           They provide comic relief from the conspirators’ violent plans.            They demonstrate Caesar’s unnatural control over his empire.            They allow the conspirators to intimidate Caesar.            They serve as omens to alert the characters and the audience that terrible things will soon happen.          5. Although Caesar wisely acknowledges that his life may be threatened, he also (Points: 3)           trusts Cassius and Brutus to protect him.            prefers to wait and see what may happen rather than to act.            ignores warnings about danger in his quest for power.            requests that Brutus stay away from the conspirators.          6. One conflict that Brutus faces and that Cassius does not is that (Points: 3)           Brutus does not know whether he can trust Casca, while Cassius trusts Casca easily.            Brutus cannot convince himself that he acted for the good of Rome, while Cassius knows that he acted for selfish reasons.            Brutus disagrees with Antony after Caesar’s murder, while Cassius and Antony are friends after the murder.            Brutus disagrees with Caesar’s wife, Calpurnia, while Antony and Calpurnia eventually marry.          7. What does Caesar say as Brutus steps forward to stab him to indicate his sense of betrayal at seeing Brutus?       (Points: 3)           Beware the Ides of March.              Et tu, Brute?              This was the noblest Roman of them all.              Veni, vidi, vici.            8. How does Marc Antony's rhetoric, such as his repeatedly calling Brutus an "honorable man," affect the crowd when he is giving his funeral speech?       (Points: 3)           Antony uses his ability to speak skillfully to make the crowd hate Caesar for his ambition.              Antony uses his ability to speak skillfully to make the crowd sympathetic to Caesar and angry with the conspirators.              Antony uses his ability to speak skillfully to make the crowd bored with what has happened to Caesar.              Antony uses his ability to speak skillfully to make the crowd mistrust everything that he says.            9. Why does Brutus urge Cassius and the others to march to Philippi to battle the forces of Antony and Octavius?       (Points: 3)           Brutus foolishly believes that if they do not move toward Philippi, they will be trapped and defeated at Sardis.              Brutus plans on betraying Cassius when they arrive at Philippi.              Brutus is terrified of seeing Caesar's ghost again at Sardis.              Brutus knows that Cassius is too afraid to make the march and wants to expose Cassius's cowardice.            10. At what point in the action is the conflict over who will lead Rome into the future resolved? (Points: 3)           when Antony leads his troops to Sardis to attack Brutus and Cassius’s forces            when the conspirators’ forces are overcome at Philippi            when Brutus claims that Cassius’s aims have become corrupted            when Brutus speaks to the crowd at Caesar’s funeral          11. Brutus decides to commit suicide at Philippi because (Points: 3)           Cassius unites his army with Antony and Octavius’s forces and turns against Brutus.            Caesar’s ghost commands him to do it, and he is too frightened to refuse.            Antony and Octavius force Brutus to kill himself so that his army will be leaderless.            Brutus’s inner conflict is resolved, and he acts honorably by killing himself to avoid defeat and capture.          12. What is the basis for Antony’s claim that Brutus is the noblest Roman of them all? (Points: 3)           Antony’s former friendship with Brutus            Brutus’s birth into a family of well-to-do aristocrats            Brutus’s goal of securing the good of Rome rather than his own good            Antony’s sarcastic response to Brutus’s treachery

Both boys, Arthur and Sundiata, went through a somewhat rough childhood. Arthur was taken from his mother the day he was born and given to another woman who raised him, who, even though raised him wonderfully, treated him as the lower of her two sons. Sundiata was a young prince that could not even walk properly, and because of this was subject to many malicious jokes.  His mother treated him hideously, and because of this, he escaped to neighboring Ghana and grew up there. Once he was a man, he returned to Mali only to find that it had been taken over by the king of Sosso, Soumaoro. However, both Arthur and Sundiata are extremely different in some aspects. Once Arthur became King of Britain, he was very content to settle his court at Camelot and stay there with his knights, playing period games such as jousting and sword fighting. Sundiata, on the other hand, was concerned with rescuing his country and family from the tyrannous sorcerer. Sundiata was not worried with if his people thought he was chivalrous or valiant, all he wanted was for his kingdom to be safe and secure.     A hero is someone who gives up everything that is of any value to save someone else from anything that might be harmful. Sir Lancelot was a hero in the way that he saved sixty-four prisoners because of his victory over Sir Tarquine, as well as the many other perilous endeavors he endured. However, Sir Lancelot did those things not out of pure love and a willingness to help another human being, but he did those things so that he would be remembered for the rest of time. Sir Lancelot wanted to be known as the daring and audacious knight that fought with the most terrifying of knights, and saved any damsel who was in distress. Sundiata, on the other hand, did not care about his name being written in the history books. Sundiata felt that it was his responsibility to conquer the cruel sorcerer Soumaoro, who had taken over his country. Soumaoro had also captured Balla Fasséké, Sundiata’s griot (at a time when the people of Mali could not read or write, the griot was a sort of living history book who recalled for the court the great deeds of the past and recited the country’s tradition and laws), as well as Sundiata’s half-sister, Nana Triban. Sundiata was prepared to surrender whatever it took to liberate his country and save his half-sister and griot, even at his own expense. Between Sir Lancelot and Sundiata, Sundiata is more of a hero than Sir Lancelot is. Sundiata did not wage war on the evil sorcerer to gain anything for himself; all he sought after was for his family and country to be out of harm's way. Both men had strong qualities of strength and kindness, even though Sir Lancelot did those valiant things for the wrong reasons; he was still chivalrous and charming all the same.     In the terms of magic, both stories have an abundance of magic woven through the plot. In the legend of Sundiata, magic shows itself first in the form of soothsayers telling Sundiata to sacrifice a hundred white bulls, a hundred white rams, and a hundred white cocks in order to defeat Soumaoro’s plentiful magical powers. The second time the reader sees magic is when Nana Triban is informing Sundiata of when she flattered Soumaoro into telling her which jinn, or genie, protects him and gives his arm the “strength of ten arms”. She then goes on to explain that Soumaoro took her into his magic chamber and told her everything.  However, in Le Morte d’ Arthur magic is the platform upon which the entire plot is written. One of the main characters, who while not necessarily being in the lime light of the story controls most of the plot, is Merlin. Throughout the story, Merlin is always in the right position at the correct moment, waiting to turn things the way he wants them. One tiny example of magic in Le Morte d’ Arthur is how Merlin arranged for King Uther to masquerade as the Duke of Tintagil so as to deceive Lady Igraine into conceiving Arthur with him. There is another place where magic is seen, and that is when Morgan le Fey, Queen of Gore, and her companions the queens of north Galys, of Estelonde, and of the Outer Isles see Sir Lancelot and each wants him for her own. Morgan le Fey then casts a spell over Sir Lancelot so that he remains asleep while they take him to her castle and make him their prisoner. The Queens then obliged him to take one of them as his mistress, or he could stay in the cell where they held him prisoner.

20090307182543AAs6WhQ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Will this hurt my chances at college?	I transferred to my current high school from another school district. Due to this, I was not able to get into all the honors classes I wanted this year. (took two this year in math and science) Now I am taking all honors and AP US History next year as a sophomore. Now, I'm aware that many colleges don't look very closely at freshman year. (receiving all A+s and one A this year) But here's the main dilemma: in my old school the highest math offered was Algebra 1 in 8th grade. In this school district you could take Algebra 1 in 7th and Geometry in 8th. Since I didn't know you could double up with Geometry and Algebra 2 this year, I am currently not on the most advanced math track (will take AP Calculus BC senior instead of junior) My counselor will not allow me to take Algebra 2 and Precalculus simultaneously next year. The only way for me to get ahead would be to take Algebra 2 over the summer, but the only place where they'll accept credit from is at one school where the course costs over $1,000. Due to my current financial situation (especially in this awful economy), paying that much money for a summer course is unrealistic. I'm not looking to attend Harvard or anything, but I'm looking toward some competitive schools such as Reed, Bates, Grinnell, and Vassar. Now, this wouldn't be such a problem if I wanted to be an English major or anything. But how would it look applying to these types of schools for a Chemistry or Physics major without being on the most advanced math track? Will schools hold this against me?

It was hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, but too hot for anybody to stay and watch. Everyone stayed in the cool comfort of their homes. Listless branches hung to the ground too tired to dance with the wind. Even the wind was exhausted, too worn out to even cool the heat, it just pushed the hot air around. It was the kind of day in which one should sit directly in front of a fan, or better yet an air conditioner, with a book and some ice cold lemonade. Definitely not a day for strenuous activity. Most definitely not a day for running, unless of course you wished to pass out from heat exertion.      The girl ran but she was tired and hot. Sweat matted her curls down and the effort had made her round cheeks red and her breath come out in rasping gasps. She had come such a long way already, at a pace that suggested her life depended on it, which it very well did. The Torments were fast approaching.       Torments were ugly, malicious little creatures, and once set loose would not stop until they had caught their prey. They were only about twenty inches high but fierce, they had but to touch you to cause tremendous mental amguish, they needed no rope to keep you bound.       Reluctantly, she stopped and leaned up against a solid oak to catch her breath. The sound of nearby twigs snapping urged her forward, so she brushed the sweaty curls from her brow and continued to run, her curls streaming in the wind. The Torments were gaining. All they could think of was the girl and they stared after her with their beady yellow eyes and gnashed their teeth.       Sweat poured down the small of her back, and her side ached constantly but still she ran. She had to. She had stolen the First Book and there was no turning back now. The book clutched to her chest didn’t look like anything special. It was bound in age mottled leather and was rather worn but she held it like something precious.   Ahead of her loomed the Hairy Forest, the most dangerous place in REM, but the girl ran in without a second thought. She had to get away from the Torments. She had to find a safe haven for the book.       In her haste she never noticed the glowing. Everly just ran right through the yellow, blue and green swirling vortex of light that had suddenly opened ahead of her. Perhaps if she had seen it she would have not gone through it, and maybe gone around it to some other adventure, but that would make this a very different story.       The sudden quiet chill made her realize she was suddenly alone. Nausea rumbled in her belly as the tumbling sensation hit. Everly was falling and it seemed like a very long way down.

20090307191037AABnzRg	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Why should I keep up with my education?	I know it's important, but not in my eyes. To me, getting an education is just a waste of 12 years of someone's life unless they like it and I have ALWAYS hated school, ever since kindergarten (well, preschool, actually, but that doesn't count). I don't plan to do anything in my life. There's no specific job or goal I have in mind or college I want to go to. Actually, I never even thought about college but I know I won't like it. My cousin took me to the college she attended before when I was 10 and it was horrible. A total nightmare. Even my cousin said she hated it. She only went there because she didn't know what else to do. Anyway, I wouldn't make it college. I'm barely making it through 9th grade and I barely made it though elementary and middle school (also nightmares). I wanted to drop out at 16, but my cousin said just go through with it, so my mom will be happy. My cousin is pretty much the only one who understands this and she brightens things up a little. But still, I can't find a good enough reason to keep up with my education. Can anyone tell me some reasons? That would help a little.      I actually wanted to be a prostitute, but my cousin told me I'll end up dead doing that. That wouldn't really matter to me because I've thought about killing myself many times just to get away from school. My cousin is the only person who can keep me alive. I'll stay alive for her.

And i have decided to take AP Physics but i am not too sure on which. Should i take ap physics b or c? Which one do you think is better? Cause, i want to take C because it's only 1 class hour and B is two class hours... Students who are taking physics b right now say that it's pretty hard since the teacher isn't doing so well? And we only have one physics b teaccher plus, isn't physics c much harder?   idk, what do you think and what classes (if you took them) were easier?

20090307185415AA7hibn	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you pleases help me summarize this ( 10 pts)?	Odetta was more than just a singer. She used her classically trained voice and some guitar playing to channel the colorful and sometimes deeply sad stories that make up American folk music. Odetta influenced generations of musicians and became an icon in the civil rights struggle. She died on December 2, 2008, after battling heart disease. She was 77 years old.        Odetta's voice sang for many. The highly praised folk singer gave life to the songs of working people and slaves, farmers and miners, housewives and washerwomen, African Americans and whites. She didn't just sing the notes in the songs. Odetta "became" the people in the songs and performed as though she felt what they felt.        "What distinguished [Odetta] from the start was the … care with which she tried to re-create the feeling of her folk songs [when she performed],'' Time magazine wrote in 1960.        Odetta's life began in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1930. She moved with her family to Los Angeles, California, when she was 6 years old. Odetta started studying music when she was 13 and later studied opera singing at Los Angeles City College, where she became interested in folk music. She came to prominence in the folk music world in the 1950s.        Odetta had not lived the lives of the people in her songs, but she was interested in their stories.           "I'm not a real folk singer,'' Odetta told The Washington Post in 1983. "I don't mind people calling me that, but I'm a musical historian. I'm a city kid who has admired an area and who got into it. I've been fortunate. With folk music, I can do my teaching and preaching … . ''        Odetta used music to preach messages of hope, justice, and humanity during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. She encouraged African Americans to take pride in themselves. In August 1963, she sang a song called "I'm on My Way" at the historic March on Washington, the civil rights demonstration where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.        During this time, folk music was experiencing a boom. Singers like Harry Belafonte, Joan Baez, and Bob Dylan began performing and recording songs in which they expressed their views on civil rights and other issues of the day. They and many other folk superstars were influenced by Odetta.        "The first thing that [got me into] folk singing was Odetta," Dylan said in 1978.        Odetta released album after album of songs. She was considered for Grammys in the 1960s and as recently as 2005. In 1999, she was honored with a National Medal of the Arts. President Bill Clinton said her career showed "us all that songs have the power to change the heart and change the world.''           In spite of her failing health, Odetta performed 60 concerts in the last two years. Her singing ability never diminished. Neither did her enthusiasm for singing. In 1983, she said that for her, music was still a way to express hope and grief.           "There's always something to sing about," Odetta said.

20090307194510AAeq1f8	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What colleges offer both a language interpreting program AND a program in music performance?	I'm trying to figure out where I want to go to college.  I've been debating between becoming an interpreter, as I love languages, and my mom is becoming an American Sign Language interpreter, I think that would be fun; and between music education, I've played guitar for 8 years, love it, and thought I'd enjoy teaching music at a college.  However I think I'd prefer being an interpreter, and also I think part of the reason I'd want to do music is simply to have the chance of going through college focused on guitar, it'd be so enjoyable.  So I decided I'd go for interpreting, and double-major in that and in music performance in guitar.  However trying to look for colleges that would offer something like that is difficult.  I live in Charlotte, NC and would prefer to go somewhere not TOO far away...hopefully within six hours perhaps.  Please, suggest others, but consider that too.        Oh, and for my language, I'm native in english, and would be interested in interpreting Spanish or Japanese, initially at least.  And for guitar, I'd prefer a jazz program over classical.  Thanks so much for your help!

Coyote from “How the Buffalo Were Released” and Geronimo were alike but different in ways. Coyote was trying to release the buffalo on earth from a man named Humpback, and Geronimo and his followers were trying to escape from the reservation in search of an untied existence. Geronimo was a real person; Coyote was not. Geronimo and Coyote had a few of the same skills but this didn’t mean they would achieve their goals.   Coyote and Geronimo showed determination in similar ways. Coyote didn’t give up when he turned himself into and a bird and failed. Instead the next day he turned into a dog. Coyote was determined to release the buffalo. Geronimo showed determination after being captured many of times, he continued on escaping from the reservations.     Geronimo and Coyote showed bravery in the same way. Geronimo bravery showed when he was escaping the lands because he knew there could be punishment. Coyote showed bravery by entering Humpback’s home and releasing the buffalo because Humpback knew Coyote was a trickster.   Geronimo and Coyote both had leadership and gained mythological status among their people. Coyote had councils to discuss his plan. His people thought it was a good idea .Coyote’s leadership was different than Geronimo’s. Coyote released the buffalo on his own; Geronimo had followers escaping with him.     Coyote and Geronimo were in different situations but both were brave and had determination in similar ways.  Their leaderships were different from one another. Coyote succeeded but Geronimo did not. Power or leadership doesn’t mean success.

20090307191647AA8ogP4	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Are there 0-6 pharmacy progams by me and will I get in?	I'm a sophomore in high school and have a 3.91 GPA, am in multiple activities including FCCLA, Peers for Peers, Youth Teaching Youth, FCA, tennis, track and field, and I plan on pursuing many more clubs as i advance in my high school years, as well as get my grades above a 4.0. Also my goal for my ACT score is to get a 28 (on the PLAN test it estimated that I would get from 26-30). Right now I am in all honors classes and one AP class. Next year i will take AP biology as well as honors chemistry, and my senior year i will take AP chemistry, as well as multiple other college level classes.       For the past year or so, i've had my heart set on becoming a pharmacist, and i plan on getting a job at the local grocery store as a pharmacy tech this summer. Now I have found out about the 0-6 pharmacy program, and i am thinking that it would be a better option for me. Now for my questions:      Do you think it likely that i would make it into the program if i continue on the track I have planned for myself?       And do you know of any 0-6 programs around Minnesota? I know that SDSU and NDSU both have 6 year programs, but it is my understanding that they are 2+4 programs; though i'm not entirely sure about that.      Also, is it possible to get a minor in spanish while in a 0-6 program? Or is there no option of a minor? I am currently in my 3rd year of spanish, and plan on continuing through a 5th year in college, and i know having spanish as a second language would be highly useful working with everyday people and their medicines.      Sorry this is so long!! Maybe i'm overthinking this, but i just have my heart set on becoming a pharmacist, and i want to do everything i can to be successful in this path i've chosen, though i've chosen it so early in my life. Thank you! I'll appreciate any info or tips you can give me!

20090307212849AAyhAdY	Education & Reference;Other - Education	I need major help!! I'm so undecided! Everyone please answer!?	So I'm in 8th grade and I am homeschooled over the internet. This is my first year homeschooling. I deciced to homeschool so I can work on my career more. I have been working with mtv producers and java records on an album. I'm an exceptional singer expecially for my age, and I've always wanted to live as a celebrity.   But I'm going to be starting highschool next year. And it may not seem like a big deal, but it really is. The highschool that I decide to go to could change everything. And here's why...      I could go to this sort of run down highschool, but it is an excpetionaly highschool to go to for performing arts. I was already accepted and they would really like for me to join. If I have to fly to LA or go to NY for anything, it would count as my school time. Awesome right? Since it's performing arts, If I'm involved with anything else like that, I'd be counted as credit. Also, there would only be about 50 people in my graduating class "just for performing arts" -- which means it will be 100X easier to score highest in my class which is what you need to get into a good college. But-- there's a dress code. I'm a fashionista! It's a great school for my type of thing, but it's also a little trashy, and has a dress code.! ahhh.!      My second option would be to go to the regional highschool that all of my friends are going to. It's a wonderful school. Very clean, great teachers, it's in the top 5 list of excellent schools in New Jersey. But it's all about the education there. I'd have to work really hard if I went there. But I want to go there to be a normal girl! I want to be able to hang with my friends and all the hot guys. I want to go to normal school proms, look cute for school everyday, etc. Going to this highschool would mean major popularity points for me. Plus-- no unforms or dress code. =]      Third option, I can homeschool again. Homeschooling is great, I get educated, and I also have time to work on my singing and other things working on my career. But I want to be a normal kid. Is homeschooling for highschool like loserish? Because I'm definitely not a loser. I've been the popular girl my entire life throughout junior high ( not conceited ). I just want to live that during high school too.          I know that was sort of long, but if you read it all, I really do appreciate it. I'm under alot of stress and pressure. I want to pursue my dream, but it would be taking away so many things I'd love to do in my teen years. I want to go to this performing arts school-- its what I do. I want to go to this regional school-- i want to live the teenage highschool life. I want to homeschool-- its easy, no waking up early, more time for working on singing.       I'm just so undecided. And I need help.    It may not seem like a big deal... but it really is to me.      What do I do? If I go to the regional school, I can still work really hard and be like a normal kid. But I wouldn't have time for the recording studio or anything. :/ And If I go to the performing arts school, there's no such thing as hot guys, cliques, cheerleading there. Its so different!         PLEASE HELP!!

20090307200758AAoVCdO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Will this hurt my chances at college?	I transferred to my current high school from another school district. Due to this, I was not able to get into all the honors classes I wanted this year. (took two this year in math and science) Now I am taking all honors and AP US History next year as a sophomore. Now, I'm aware that many colleges don't look very closely at freshman year. (receiving all A+s and one A this year) But here's the main dilemma: in my old school the highest math offered was Algebra 1 in 8th grade. In this school district you could take Algebra 1 in 7th and Geometry in 8th. Since I didn't know you could double up with Geometry and Algebra 2 this year, I am currently not on the most advanced math track (will take AP Calculus BC senior instead of junior) My counselor will not allow me to take Algebra 2 and Precalculus simultaneously next year. The only way for me to get ahead would be to take Algebra 2 over the summer, but the only place where they'll accept credit from is at one school where the course costs over $1,000. Due to my current financial situation (especially in this awful economy), paying that much money for a summer course is unrealistic. I'm not looking to attend Harvard or anything, but I'm looking toward some competitive schools such as Reed, Bates, Grinnell, and Vassar. Now, this wouldn't be such a problem if I wanted to be an English major or anything. But how would it look applying to these types of schools for a Chemistry or Physics major without being on the most advanced math track? Will schools hold this against me?

I have okay grades (4.0 GPA), and have taken 2 AP and 2 honors classes so far. My parents are afraid that I'd be wasting my potential to go to an art school though (I know I could have got better grades, I've just had so many disruptions/problems lately). I don't have any particular interest in any academic classes (math, English, science, hisoy, etc.), and art is basically the only field I'm interested in, and I dislike how classes like English/math are so important when applying to other universities. I noticed, though, that art colleges don't have language lasses, and I'd like to continue with studying French. Which would be better for me to go to, considering all the advs/disadvs of both?

The answer is $112,087.09      so Im sort of lost on where im tripping and i was away when my teacher taught this so dont be saying to me those useless words " pay attention in class" i do pay attention in class just i wasnt there on that day, going over it by myself with a useless pre-cal book isnt easier said then done.       My other problem is similar to the one i just asked for help about. But you have to determine the amount of time needed for $1,000 to be doubled, compounded annually, monthly, daily, and continously    the rate is 11%       So far this is what i got A = $1000(1+.11)^t      t=ln2/ln(1.11) = 6.642 yrs       which is the answer but the other ones Im sort of confused on, is it suppose work the same if u divide the (1+r) with 12(monthly), 365(daily), e^tr (continously) Im sure i can get the continously but daily and monthly i been having hard time on, any clues or tips on how to solve these?
