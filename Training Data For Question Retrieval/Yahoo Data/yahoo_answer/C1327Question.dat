20090202104149AAGf9kl	Social Science;Psychology	How many personalities are generally exhibited in dissociative personality disorder?	i'm working on a psychology project in which we have to create a board game with questions. every time a person tries to move a space(s) they must answer a question, however, our book does not fully explain many symptoms, problems, and causes of the disorder. if anyone has any information about it, information that is very simply explained/laid out, please let me know :]

20090202110023AAjP630	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	WOMEN... other than having KIDS and shacking up with a MAN. What are your GOALS in life?	I ask this question, because it seems that despite FEMINISM, the majority of women still put more effort and time into "meeting prince charming" and "starting a family" than anything else.      It's as if that's the only reason to live.      I personally, don't have a problem with this. However, I see a lot of HYPOCRISY in having such low goals while expecting men to be so ambitious at the same time.      So tell me your life goes LADIES. What are they?

I had a dream that my nan was a ninja and she started beating up bad guys in somerfields supermarket and doing flips and cartwheels all over the place then she gave the manager a flying roundhouse kick and knocked him out and said "that's what you get for nicking my teeth!" then she threw a smoke bomb and dissapeared. do you think my nan is secretly a ninja? i think it might be a bit of a dangerous job for her and i'm quite concerned as she is 80 years old!
20090202110911AAKFy8u	Social Science;Economics	How is having a negative trade balance good for US jobs and our economy?	When we buy more than we sell (and on borrowed money nonetheless) don't we just become more poor? How the heck does that help us? If in the new Stimulus package that's introduced, it has a buy American clause, what's the worst it could do? Would it, egads! give us a TRADE DEFICIT? Hmmmmm. Sounds kinda fishy, doesn't it? Maybe it might make buying a t-shirt at Wallmart a bit more expensive, but wouldn't you rather know the money you spend is going to help American workers? And if you think union "greed" is to blame for so many companies going overseas, do you also think it's "fair" to pay workers $2 or so a day (and sell the product for $100 like they do brand-name sneakers?) in the USA, like they do overseas?

20080514094556AAqlpzY	Social Science;Psychology	Pensez vous que les hommes font semblant d'aimer pour baiser ?	C'est une question sérieuse et si le dernier terme est un peu cru, il a le mérite d'être explicite car "faire l'amour" était un peu trop romantique dans le cadre de cette question.      cette question fait suite a une longue et électrique discussion entre amis(es) dont certain (les hommes en général) évoquaient le fait qu'un homme pourrait se contenter de l'amour de sa famille et de ses amis sans avoir a jeter son dévolu sur une seule et unique personne.       Ce serait donc le besoin d'une relation charnelle qui le pousserait a transformer ses sentiments... maquillés en "amour" pour cette occasion (sentiments réels qui pourraient venir plus tard dans la relation)      Quel serait la part du vrai et du faux la dedans ? Qu'en pensez vous ?

20081002072256AAkCf7q	Social Science;Psychology	Learning to drive seems overwhelming, any advice?	well actually i am just about to book my practical test but today i had a bad lesson. For some reason my leg felt weak and has been slipping backwards when taking my foot off the clutch causing the car to jerk forward and not been in full control, but that doesnt matter because i know i only slept for half an hour lastnight and got up early.       However, i am a fairly confident driver and i am usually confident that i have got just about everything sussed out but today i felt like everything was getting on top of me. Things like not looking over my right shoulder when bay parking and misreading road markings. The worst thing i did today was actually illigal let alone a fail, i forgot my instructor told me to turn right at the roundabout and i approached in the left hand lane. When i realised my mistake i quickly put my right indicator on and changed to the right hand lane when i was on the roundabout which was dumb to say the least.      is all this forgetfulllness to do with tiredness or maybe nerves because of my approaching test?      has anyone else expierenced the same thing? How can i restore my confidence?

I can understand that underaged drinking is considered bad for their health fair enough. but if responsible adults let their children have a tiny sip or very watered down wine or beer at special occasions do you think this is good or bad? my mum let me drink wine on its own and i grew up not liking alcohol and havnt changed! then if children are brought up with alcohol they may turn into heavy drinkers themselves or worse! what are your opinions?   im asking because i just saw a father letting his son take a sip of beer, and people were very shocked!

20081025074045AAQZZB9	Social Science;Psychology	Mental illness Help - Please?	I dont know where to start really, about 2 years ago I started suffering form Depression and Anxiety, which was horrible I was also on Anti-Depressants which just didnt agree with me and made me worse. During the Course of about a Year I saw an amazing Councellor who was fantastic and re-assured me a great deal, as time went on my symptons seem to very very slightly improve, about 5 Months ago, I had, had enough and decided to come of the Tablets, and ween myself of them very very slowly to minimize WithDrawral Symptoms, about 9 weeks ago I took my last tablet, since I came of the tablets I have felt a lot better, and have seen a big increase in my recovery, I seem to have 1 week good and 1 week bab, but then the good week would last lightly longer, during this time, i happen to read an article on OCD, to me OCD was like constantly checking the door or gas, little did i know that there was something out there called OCD thoughts, which when reading about it described my symptoms to a TEE, better that anything else had. I then realised why my Depressiona and Anxiety was so hard to get rid of it was because i wasnt working on the main course (OCD thoughts) I had always been told to take a negative though and make it into a Positive which isnt what you are suppose to do in OCD thoughts, the idea to get rid of them is to let them in, and not to analyze them, anyway about 3 weeks ago i bought a book on it and put the theory into practice and i must say my re-occuring negative intrusive thoughts have almost banished, I can nearly say i have beaten OCD. During the past 3 weeks I have noticed symptoms of Stress and Anxiety creeping back, but why is this, I have no reason anymore to feel like this? Why when i beat one thing i.e OCD does another come back in force? It seems I am destined to have some form of Mental illness and how ever much i beat one part of it another comes back? Is there any Concellors our there, or people with expirence that can help?

20081025081736AAT7Klh	Social Science;Psychology	Darn i'm so confused, she seems outa my league but sometimes it seems that she likes me?	ok so there's a tall blonde girl at my school (a school that happens once a week, not every day) who's just as tall as me. and she's the most "popular" girl in the school (also the best looking) and i'm just sorta on the fringe of the "popular crowd". she's as tall as me but almost a year younger. on the first week i noticed her but thought she was way outa my league. but...   i very well might be seeing something where there's nothing, but she might have been trying to get my attention:      -for some odd reason (not sure seems like she was trying to make it this way) she kept being at the door when i was going through it at school, and naturally i got it for her (didn't flirt w/ her then or even make eye contact cause i didn't think i had a chance, i just got the door like i would any other girl).    ~of course it could be just a coincidence.      -she also was looking at me in study hall while our mutual friend was talking about me how i nailed him by tackling in football during lunch, smiling, but it also seemed like she coulda been checking me out.   ~of course that's just probably cause it was a funny story.      -then the week after that i was talking to my friend (female) before study hall started and she walked in and sat right across from my friend and was looking back and forth like she maybe wanted to be in the conversation. and she never sits at that table. i didn't even look in her direction or anything then because i didn't know her at all.    ~but it could be just that she was just sitting in a different place for the heck of it.      i'm not sure if she likes me based on those facts so please tell me what you think, but i was at a party tonight and we got to be in the same group of people. she seemed like she addressed me more than the other girl did and i didn't know either of them at all. she asked me questions like where i went to church and stuff. and when she was about to leave she asked who i was, i told her, but she didn't volunteer her name till i asked her (which seemed weird to me). so what do you think in whole about what she thinks of me? if i'm crazy don't sugarcoat it, tell me the truth. How can you tell when a girl tries to get to know you and stuff whether she just wants to be friends or actually likes you? thanks ahead of time.

20090205095840AAUx5Xy	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream interpretation? Can you help?	So a couple of weeks ago I had a dream were I was with my ex boyfriend and his friend and that I almost tripped while walking with them. When I woke up for some reason I told myself I needed to remember that dream. I don"t know why? Also I've had a reoccurring dream about my ex saying a lot of different random things like I had a dream where it would just replay over and over him saying "and then i threw it up in the air" and he would pretend to throw something in the air. and I've had other dreams of him saying other stuff too. So yesterday for some reason his friend called me and asked me if I wanted to hang out. I said yeah and we went to this little park and just talked then when we were walking home a bunch of stuff from my dreams happened ( like the tripping). And all of a sudden every random thing he said in my dream, he said. Coincidence? Does this mean anything?
20090205104541AAZWgad	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	In my dream our baby becomes a doll?	I had a dream last night that I unexpectedly (almost instantly) gave birth to a baby boy.  He didn't look like either of us but had a HUGE smile and giggled constantly. We were both ecstatic.  I asked my fiance, "We didn't buy a bed for him, where should he sleep?" My fiance said "It's okay, I know what to do." While I breastfed him (which felt completely normal) my fiance made a makeshift bassinet out of a wicker laundry basket, pillows & receiving blankets. I pat the baby's back gently and put him in the basket, after a while he started to cry.  When i went to check his diaper - his body was made out of cloth (like a doll) and his legs were plastic.  I woke up feeling panicked.        What does this mean?

20090205103538AAid3WS	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I've been having creepy dreams?	I had a dream a few weeks ago. I was running from something that unless you've seen the corresponding movies, you won't get. It was a sort of cross between vampire, licker, zombie, and hemocyte. It looked creepy and disgusting as hell. I was running, trying to get away, but when I couldn't run anymore I gave up and stopped. I felt it eating me, trying not to think about it while knowing I would die. I felt peace. Then a few nights later, I had another dream. I was in a hospital for some reason, and a bunch of feds showed up. And by feds, I mean full-blown FBI, suits and everything with guns, cuffs, and big F E D letters on their backs. They wanted me to go with them, and it had something to do with my sister Arie. All I knew was that I couldn't let them take me. I tried to run, they caught me and I fought my way loose. Thank you, sis, for teaching me how to defend myself, I thought. I ran out the door and into the waiting room that wasn't a waiting room anymore. It was a maze of doors, all opening into and away from one another. I dove into the nearest one and slammed it satisfyingly into one fed's face. I dodged through, working my way through the doors and around the too-damned-fast feds. I finally made it out into the hallway and sprinted to the elevator. I knew it was too slow, but I didn't know where the stairs were. The feds rounded the corner and grabbed me. I fought as best I could, and some would be on medical leave for a while, but there were just too many. I considered giving up, not running anymore.  knew what would happen, but I wanted to stop running. I was tired of running. I don't know how, but that seemed deeper than just running from policemen. And I woke up. I haven't had any dreams since, and I'm wondering what it means. I have some of my own interpretations, but I was hoping someone new could give me any other insight into this "give it up, I'm tired of running" feeling. So what do you think?

20090205113421AAWifnY	Social Science;Psychology	A dream about being kidnapped?	Last night I had a dream about this guy that I know.  In my dream he had kidnapped me and was keeping me in his house.  I don't know how it happened or when it was or how long I had been there.  I just know that he was keeping me there and he was nice to me, but he had still kidnapped me.  I spilled something or made a mess on my shirt so he got me two shirts that I could choose from and he walked me into the bathroom and handed me the shirts and locked the door so I could change and as soon as he locked the door I heard the phone ring and I knew he would answer it and this was my chance to escape.  There was a window, but it was really high.  I had to climb into the bath tub and then climb onto a ledge and then open the window and crawl through it.  I was really afraid he was going to come back and I kept looking behind me.  After I got through the window I was in this room that I could stand up in and there was another window that I had to climb through.   Once I got out I ran across the street to where houses were.  As I was running across the street I kept looking behind me at the front of his house expecting to see him coming after me, but he wasn’t there and I felt bad.  I kind of felt like I should go back.  I kind of thought he would catch me anyway and that he was going to be really mad and that if I went back right now I could just crawl back in the window and he would never know what happened and I wouldn't get in trouble.  I also wanted to go back because I didn't want him to get into trouble and he had been really nice to me and took good care of me and I really didn't want anything bad to him.  I kept going and I found someone and was about to go into their house to hide and I woke up.      I know that he would never do anything like that to me or anyone else.        What do you think of the dream?      What does it mean?

I have awful teachers this year, all of whom are making it extremely difficult for me to take an interest in my classes and, thus, to get good grades.

Recentemente, vi na TV um policial federal usando uma marreta, algo assim, para rrrombar a porta de uma casa onde supostamente estariam escondidos  objetos piratas. Ele estava aocmpanhado p/ seus colegas e conseguiu arrombar a casa. Isso é correto?? E no caso de uma execu??o judicial - alguém que n?o conseguiu pagar suas dívidas com uma financeira e foi processado e condenado judicialmente - ocorre o mesmo?  Se o executor for a sua (dele) casa e n?o houver ninguém, ele pode arrombar a porta de sua casa, mediante testemunhas, e levar objetos de valor?? Se a resposta for positiva, que raios de Lei é esta????!!! Obrigada.
