I got an Email a few days ago saying "You've won 9700000 British Pounds Sterling!      I read this, and was like..wow. What a waste of a good Email. But then, reading again, I see..      "Yahoo is pleased to inform you..."      Top of the page says that it's from YAHOO also.       "in the Yahoo! All New Year Promo Lottery Draw held on 11th of February 2009."       Then of course, it gives me some stuff to fill out, and says to send it to an email address. It says at the bottom,       "Name: Mr. DANIEL G. TEJADA   [His email and phone number]      Best regards and congratulations!      Mrs. Hilary Blair   The Director-General   FOR: The board of directors"      Then it has the copyright info.      Now. I'm still have no real belief that this is possible, I mean come on..It says it's from Yahoo. So we either have a law suit, or a few million british pounds, right?      Please. Comments.

20090223132415AArZWeP	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why can't we flag stupid questions?	I've been an "answerer" for almost a week now, and I keep seeing the same exact questions being asked in the same exact sections over and over and over and over and over and over and over.  If someone is going to take the time to ask the questions, couldn't they just take two seconds to search for it and find the answer 100 times over?      Not to mention the fact that there are so many questions that are just so ridiculous that they just drown out real, valid ones.      While these may not be against the community guidelines, they're really making this otherwise awesome website unbearable.      So my question is... why can't we flag questions for different things, other than simply guidelines abuse?

What's the point of yahoo ask if we are not allowed to ask others about how they feel about a certain subject and then turn around and see that your question has been deleted? Is that fair? People are allowed to leave stupid answers that do not even pertain to the askers question the least bit, yet certain questions are not allowed! At the same time we can't remove stupid answers...What a JOKE! If the question offends you, ignore it, rather than complain and wine to yahoo support. Let everyone else have a fair share in asking their questions!
