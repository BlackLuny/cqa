BT7JeMx3aa	For a 7 year old, I would strongly suggest Gamecube. Many reasons. For example, good luck finding a Wii. If you can buy that. The Gamecube isnt just for kids. I've had mine for years and except for my Wii, I wouldnt have it any other way. Nintendo offers a wide selection of games for it. For starters, they have all the Mario and Zelda games which would be great for someone so young. But as he gets older, they do have some more mature games, like Gun, as well as many many sports titles. I've included a link to a list of the titles available. And you can find most of the games now for $30 and under. Only drawback is, Nintendo isnt making a whole lot of new games because of the Wii. But at $100 for the system brand new and $30 a game average, you cant go wrong. Get a Wii if you can. At $250 and $50 a game, it is worth it. Especially since they will be making new games.<br>  <br>  Do Not Buy A Playstation 2! Or Xbox 360. You are right PS2 is very very fragile. I've known people who've stupidly had them break 2-3 times and they still go out and buy a new one (at $200 a piece...still). Now most games are about $40-$50. Xbox 360 games are $60. And the system runs about $400. And there isnt a whole lot of good titles.<br>  <br>  OK, so I'm a little biased. I've only had Nintendo systems my whole life. I grew up with them, I still play on a daily basis. But I wouldn't have it any other way.|`|RLiQj1OIaa	i would give him a ds its portable and has kinda good games <br>  the next verisons of Nintendo will probably be compatible with the ds like the gameboy with gba|`|dOOF6xhWaa	I reccommend the ninetendo Wii. Awesome. Pretty nice games for it. You can use the remote to do many different kinds of things, depending on which game. It can even last through adulthood, because teens and kids aren't the only kids obssessed with this game console. Wii can also make you lose weight! Only if your EXTREMELY excited when you play. THe new games for the Wii sell for about $50 each. The old ones sell for about $10 to $20 cheaper. There's a huge variety of games for the Wii, from Poke'mon to Mario. When i mean using the remote, i don't mean just pressing the buttons. You are supposed to play by moving and wiggling the remote around. Kind of hard to explain. SOmetimes bonus games r included when you buy the console, depending on what pack you buy. You can get more info on Wii.com. :D|`|AOy1wf3waa	NOT A WII, wii will last a month and you'll get bored.<br>  my opinion is ps2/3,xbox/360, or a DS|`|Oa6NGn5oaa	Gamecube is good because the games don't have all the gore that others do.  I wouldn't say it is just for little kids however, i enjoy mine.<br>  <br>  Also, there will be about ten new systems before you child is thirteen.  Each company will have an upgraded system around every three years.<br>  <br>  Games for all systems usually start at $50 each.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Ciao

S66gFfcpaa	It says PKRS in a purple box above your pokemon when you view thier summary.   Pokerus heals itself if you keep them on your team when 12 oclock hits.  PM or AM both apply.  Once it strikes 12 your pokemon will heal of pokerus if they are on your team.  Pokemon infected with pokerus that are in your boxes will not lose thier pokerus and can keep it infinately.  When a pokemon is healed of pokerus they have that serious looking smily face on thier summary.|`|sBYp3dISaa	It will have the symbol you talk about store it in a box to prevent pokerus from dissapearing and every time you train take it out to infect the other pokemons and put it again in|`|TYuoNlCAaa	that mark ( :( )means it had pokerus and it went away. your pokemon have pokerus if by their name (when you are checking summary), there is PKRS is a purple box.  they will then grow fast.  i had one pokemon with it, and it spread to my whole team!  if there is a frowny face, it means that pokemon had it, but can never get it again

1G3XPiq3aa	It's cheaper in store I think. I picked my copy up for 30 euro, which is only about $20 USD I think. Buy the CDs if you don't want to wait for the download. It takes a while, and it's almost certain you'll have to reinstall at some point. But if the download time and bandwidth doesn't bother you, just buy online.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i personally wouldnt buy software from ebay, ya never know for sure what shape its in or how picky they will get if it is broken and you want to return it....<br>  <br>  but wherever you buy it from, it is always nice to have the cd around.  so definatly buy the cd.|`|WuhIoS1laa	I wouldn't buy software from eBay if I could get it anywhere else. Save the eBay coupon for something less dicey. <br>  <br>  eBay auctions are often misleading.  You might be getting the CD only and no upgrade code, or the code has been used, or is invalid. Best bet is   to either pay to upgrade online from account management and download the client from Blizzard for free, or walk into a Best Buy and pick up the expansion.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	Buy the E-bay one, it's useful to have a cd around for re-install (using a CREDIT card.)<br>  <br>  make sure it is the right area wow though, america/ eu/ russia.<br>  <br>  credit card = get your money back if you've been scammed.|`|H8uCYaCaaa	dont get off e-bay they will have used it so then u still need 2 activats your account, u can but it from wow.com and u downloaded it off there free when i hv bought your account upgread|`|ty9nJiSkaa	Yup i agree with chris it is always nice to have the CD.

f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	If you're at the point where you're thinking this seriously about strategy, it's time for you to graduate to real games and stop playing tic-tac-toe. After all, every game of tic-tac-toe ends in a tie if both players know what they're doing. Where's the excitement in that?<br>  <br>  If you really must get into tic-tac-toe, my recommendation is to grab the center square if it's free. Once it's taken, grab a corner unless you're forced to do otherwise in order to block your opponent. You can also force a tie by starting with a corner, I just prefer the center square.<br>  <br>  As for first moves, I would agree that there are really only three: center, corner, or edge. Once you take symmetry into account, there's really no difference between the different corner squares or the different edge squares.|`|1a6a009f525618df7a7b7c68ce2da61eaa	There are 9 options, but you don't really want to mark any squares other than the corner ones or the center one. <br>  <br>  So, you really only have 5 good options.<br>  <br>  Also, to think about it more technically, there are 18 possible first moves. There are 9 spaces, and each space could be marked with an x or an o, so 18.|`|hB6njLG0aa	You have only one thechnical 1st move but 9 choices to make. I would suggest one of the corners as it is my way of playing but that has no permanent affect if the second player knows the stratagie.|`|b81H0vlYaa	9 i suppose because there are only 9 squares, in the traditional game.  There are however several different versions, one I know uses 3 levels of "#"

eD7qRBKHaa	Six Flags is mostly a roller coaster park.  Disneyland is a true theme park.  The amazing attention to detail is what sets all Disney parks far above all the other parks I have ever been to.  If I had to pick one, I would pick Disneyland, no question.|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	Six flags has more thrill rides. like roller coasters, etc. Disney has themed rides.  they don't just paint it black, put a batman logo on it and called it a batman coaster, they try to recreate a runaway train or being in space.<br>  <br>  Six flags feels more like a fair and Disney more like a theme park. if you just want coasters, six flags might be a better option. if you like Disney and all things Disney, then that is the better choice.|`|GksSFTcVaa	I had this same question a few days ago too. I found out that if you are more of a fun person and like to just hangout, eat food, go on cool: slow rides, Disneyland is the place for you. Six Flags are for more outgoing people and who want the feeling of "Whoosh" in their stomachs on the fast rides. They want more of the adrenaline rush. I personally would decide to go to Disneyland because it is a classic and it is a great place to hang with friends.|`|wRb4Wgj1aa	If you are going for the total experience, like shows, good food, themed rides, making memories, go to disneyland.  <br>  <br>  if you want crap service (people who don't smile), yucky food, and rides that make you puke, choose six flags.  LOL  <br>  <br>  disneyland's rides aren't as "thrilling" as six flags, but i'm (obviously) not into wild rides.  so it depends on your taste.|`|hKOc2i8maa	neither, both have people who want to rape your children.

NaAtjJHHaa	yes you do need the disk but it runs the game of the harddrive. so the xbox dont sound like a jet engine. also stops the game from gliching because the disk dont slow down or jog.|`|dB4vVoNKaa	Yes, you need the disc in the drive. Running it off the hard drive will supposedly increase performance, and will definitely decrease the noise made while playing.|`|RQdFRaANaa	Yes|`|NHAKOXyXaa	yes, but the game will be smoother and will load faster. it also helps prolong your xbox life with those red rings since it won;t expend a lot of energy reading the disc. i know this cause i used to worked in an authorized microsoft service center.|`|nFg5iqOLaa	NO YOU DONT NEED DISC CAUSE I DID IT

It'd be best take some time off, without explaining why, if possible. They're going to be very busy becoming a millionaire and they'd probably want to quit. Sockman says most winners do, even though at their original interview about a quarter claim they'll keep working. He explains, "They can't imagine how much money they've won. It's a life-changing event."<br>   <br>     * Find people they can can trust - The most important financial decision to make initially is who's going to be accountant, financial adviser and lawyer.Referral is the best way and if none of your friends or family can recommend a particular professional, it would be good to  go to a major accounting firm, a major brokerage and a large law firm.Ask what they'll do for you.<br>    <br>     * Arrange for a special account at the bank - You can't just deposit millions into your plain old checking account. And they don't really give you a paper check with a lot of zeroes. They give you the money by a wire transfer to your pre-arranged special account, says Sockman.<br>  <br>     *Last bit of advice -Yep,they should definitely change their phone number because now that they're richer than their wildest dreams, everyone's going to want to reach out and touch them, and that will be a nightmare. So get a new unlisted telephone number ;)

AA11084698	To downgrade your PSP to custom firmware you must…<br>  <br>  1) First format your memory stick (Whether your PSP is a slim or a fat).  [Warning: Formatting your Memory stick will delete EVERYTHING on the Memory stick. I recommend that you backup all of your files by copying them to your computer.

Right-click your PSP. (On the computer, you will see it as a “removable disk”. On my computer, it’s called ‘Removable Disk (H:)’ However, yours may be different)<br>      d. Scroll down and click format…<br>      e. Make sure you select : File system: FAT32<br>      f. Click Format.<br>  2) Now your memory stick should be cleared of all its files.<br>      a. Keeping your PSP plugged into the computer, Click my Computer.<br>      b. Open to your PSP. (Now you should see nothing, since you formatted it.)<br>      c. Now, create a new folder and name it “PSP”. [Without the quotes and all capital letters]<br>      d. Now double click PSP and create a new folder inside of PSP. Name it “GAME” [Without the quote and all capital letters. It is “GAME”. Do not name it “GAMES”. There is no “S”.]<br>      e.

L2S9jjdLaa	Ladbrokes roulette machines are definitely not rigged. It is just randomness generated via a software algorithm. The machines payout is purely based on the game odds (2.7% house edge).<br>  <br>  The house edge should not be confused with the hold. The hold is the total amount of cash the table changes for chips, minus the chips taken away from the table - in other words, the actual "win" amount for the casino. Gambling Commission releases a monthly report showing the win/hold amounts for machines. The average win/hold is between 21-30%, significantly more than 2.7% of all players money because players are making repeated bets after winning and losing portions of their total money. This is known in the casino gaming industry as "churning" players who statistically end up losing all their wagers.<br>  <br>  A player with a certain total amount of money may not win or lose all their money instantly, such that the total of all bets they make will often be greater than the total of the money they actually started with.<br>  <br>  The house edge applies to each bet made; not the total money, which means the player can end up losing significantly more than 2.7% of his starting money. For example it is likely that a player with $100 making $10 bets on red will be able to bet more than 10 times, because sometimes he wins. He may end up betting a total of 20 times on red. <br>  <br>  A player who continually bets until they run out of money will give the house 100% hold.|`|aIakDSstaa	I doubt it, those websites are pretty heavily regulated|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Played a roulette machine twice, never again... after 16 straight reds, several other streaks 10+, yes...

He's not talking about the website, he's talking about the machines in the bookies.|`|5de7dedaa4d56e7cb43938bd89d0e068aa	I think so.  Used to play them all the time when they were first introduced.  You can see patterns in them which makes it quite easy to get some money out of them.  It does comes and goes like any gambling games.<br>  <br>  But now, you can't win a penny of them.  Every time you get a big win or starts to have a winning streak the machines suddenly have a delay in it and next thing you know you've gone through your money like water.|`|4WxJvc5Raa	It is the same as slot machines, the machine will payout in the region of 95%+ of the amount paid in over time.

They are a more family orientated machine rather than a games console you can play on your own,although you can of course.They have a lot of great family games such as bowling,rifle shooting,tennis etc and the remote controller is superb fun.<br>  If you decide that the wii isnt for you then that will leave you with the choice of either the ps3 or the 360.<br>  <br>  Let's compare PS3 and XBOX 360:<br>  <br>  1). A third of XBOX 360 (33%) are malfunctioning right from the start. PS3 return rate is only around 0.2%. Despite some people say, that new 360 has no breakdown issues - just visit Xbox section of Yahoo answers and see for yourself an amount of complaints. <br>  2). PS3 has 8 (7+1) kernels in Cell processor, Xbox 360 -only 3.<br>  3). PS3 uses advanced tech called Blu-Ray, one disc can store up to 54 gb (in the future - up to 200 gb), Xbox 360 - regular dual layer DVD-9 (8.5GB). It's possible to get HD-DVD (max. - 30GB) for 360, but it'll cost you around 180$, in this case Xbox is going to be MUCH more expensive, than PS3. <br>  4). Calculations per sec - PS3 - 51-billion-dot-product-operati... per second<br>  Xbox 360 - 33.6-billion-dot-product-opera... per second<br>  5). PS3 has full media support - USBs, built-in 4 slots card reader (except 20GB and 40GB versions), ability to use printer and so on.<br>  Xbox 360 has USBs and only 2 memory slots.<br>  6). PS3 supports up to 7 Bluetooth Controllers<br>  Xbox 360 - up to 4 Controllers<br>  7). PS3 - wi-fi included (except 20 gb version)<br>  Xbox 360 - wi-fi will cost you around 100 $<br>  8). From the first technical sight - graphics are stronger in 360 (it has a stronger graphics chip - Xenos), BUT PS3 can use it's Cell CPU for graphics too, which gives you better graphics in total. PS3 uses a weaker RSX chip, that was developed by Nvidia exclusively for PS3. RSX runs on 550 Mhz. It's difficult to compare their graphics, because 360 has a video chip with totally different structure and operating memory is divided differently in both consoles. Xbox isn't that versatile in dividing tasks between CPU and GPU as PS3. That's why PS3 exclusives look better than 360's exclusives.<br>  9). PS3 uses technology from AGEIA company. It does to physics of the game same thing GPU (videocard processor) does to graphics. This thing is on sale for PC(special card). The price is around 350$. There is no such thing in 360.<br>  10). Xbox 360 is widely known for so-called "red ring of death" problem - it gets overheated easily. My PS3 was running for more than 15 hours non-stop with no problems. Sometimes Xbox 360 becomes so overheated, that thermopaste on CPU melts, drips on motherboard and successfully shortcircuits it. That's why in some countries people call Xbox 360 "Coffin 360".<br>  11). Besides all of this, I've seen disassembled Xbox 360 - regular PC architecture - Billy Gates is an uninventive nerd (as usual).<br>  When I saw disassembled PS3 - it was a surprise - smart architecture, good cooling (don't buy external PS3 coolers - they make everything worse - original system is good), etc.<br>  12). In 2008 PS3 will get more than 300 games, including Metal Gear Solid 4, The Agent and other great exclusives. Here is the good link to the future PS3 releases. <a href="http://ps3.ign.com/index/release.html......" rel="nofollow">http://ps3.ign.com/index/release.html......</a> <br>  13). PS3 online is free, Xbox 360 - you have to pay.<br>  14). There were reports, that 360 scratches discs. No reports on that in PS3.<br>  15). The funniest thing, that right now there are no games for PS3, that show full potential of the console. Biggest games weigh only 25 GB (Xbox 360 will need more than 3 discs even for those).<br>  16). On PS3 you can install other OS, such as Linux Yellow Dog, Ubuntu and others. Sony officially lets you do it. There is no such thing in 360.<br>  17). PS3 HDD can be replaced easily with any 2.5" SATA 5400 RPM HDD (used in laptops). 250 GB will cost you around 170$. In 360 you have to buy exclusive HDD, where 20GB will cost you 100$.<br>  18).Sony expects PS3 to stay on the market for, at least, 7-10 years. Also Sony reduces price now. There is a cheaper 40GB version of PS3. <br>  19).Sony constantly upgrades PS3 software (free updates for OS) - you get new functions and improvements.<br>  20). PS3 controller (sixaxis) has a motion control - you move controller - game responds. Wii has it, Xbox 360 - doesn't. PS3 is getting rumble controller (Dualshock 3) in 1st quarter 2008, Japan already has it. On www.ebay.com I saw those controllers on sale 50$ and up (unofficial import)<br>  21).On PS3 you can help sick people by running Folding Home project. Wii and Xbox 360 didn't even think about it.<br>  22).New 40GB is 399$ or 399 euro (depends on the region) - it has no backwards compatibility with PS2 games, has 2 USBs instead of 4, no built-in card reader, but it's the same PS3, strong, reliable, less noisy, different cooling system. The price is friendly.<br>  23). But, to be just, I'm not a PS3 fanboy, so (despite I own one) hear this - PS3 games (exclusives) are very hard to develop due to complicated Cell's architecture. We have to wait till developers will figure out how to develop games properly. Sometimes multiplatform games run not so good on PS3 due to the same developing issues - it's hard for developers to get a grip on such advanced technologies.<br>  <br>  I would definately narrow the choice down between the WII or the PS3 and rule out the xbox 360.<br>  <br>  Family fun games----WII<br>  Hard core top graphics----Ps3..<br>  <br>  toss a coin!!!

Y510zWjzaa	there is no way its just a random event!!|`|hrVBkf1zaa	In Blizzard''s World of Warcraft, one aspect of creating a Tauren character involves making a decision among four classes; actually, since Hunters have yet to be implemented in the current beta, the available alternatives come down to Warrior, Shaman and Druid. The last of these was introduced in mid-April, in a build that required starting new avatars within the Horde faction, which also includes Orcs, Trolls and Undead. Playing a Druid is only possible for Tauren and Night Elves. The latter was locked out at the time, as were Humans, Dwarves and Gnomes, the other three races that make up the Alliance, and thus my Tauren Druid was born. Although I''ve played at least one character of every race and class, albeit certainly not every possible combination, this is the one that has seen the most playing time to date.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gametradeking.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametradeking.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gametradeking.com/sell.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametradeking.com/sell.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gametradeking.com/video.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametradeking.com/video.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gametradeking.com/news.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametradeking.com/news.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gametradeking.com/cdkey.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametradeking.com/cdkey.asp</a>|`|tgnhaRIgaa	LOL|`|zz8Th6Svaa	may the force be with you
c97884712264a19f23634b93afda8d19aa	Hmm. It definitely sounds like your game is either glitched, dirty/smudged or scratched. If the disc is dirty, simply clean it with a damp paper towel. If it is either scratched or glitched, try to return/exchange it for a working copy at the store from which you bought it.<br>  <br>  I hate it when that crap happens. The same thing happened when I first got the Xbox game Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. I got to the final stage, only to discover that it was a glitched copy.

74QzqUDbaa	I would probably say Wii. I happen to own both because both are amazing systems to me. The reason i own both is because both syetms vary in games and gaming. The real question is do you want hands on Mario Games (Wii) or kick but hard core gaming violent games (360)? Both are fine systems just don't buy the ps3 they suck. Also take into consideration that the 360 with the ability to play normal xbox games is 500$. Where as the Wii is 250$. Both are very well money spent though. Happy gaming. ^^|`|3eFoYae7aa	Xbox 360, Best graphics and as been around longer.Whatever u do never get a PS3 they have frame rate issues|`|MSlfbPMIaa	i would go with xbox 360 because you have a bigger amount of games and your arm wont get so tired|`|TZx4Lqfraa	Wii is so amazing i have guitar hero and instead of standing right by you 360 you can stand almost anywhere with the wii guitar . Also has great games SSMB SMG and others|`|fuytAM8yaa	Go for the wii it will last you longer and its more fun and active since your not just pressing the buttons on a joy pad and for guitar hero there sort of the same but in the long run stick with the wii ;D|`|lkvFktLxaa	xbox 360 wii gets boring after 2 weeks if you dont have a new game but xbox 360 isnt like that|`|mSsaiwAdaa	I would get the 360.  My step brother has one...I've played it and it's amazing.  We also have a Wii, but they are getting pricey.  Guitar Hero on the 360 is better, it has better graphics, and you have the ability to download new songs off of XBOX Live.  The Wii does have some pretty cool features, and you can buy other old school Nintendo games off of the Wii shopping channel, which is awesome.  But, which ever you prefer.

AA11614968	If you want some more achievement points play it on the highest difficulty setting.  For me tho, i'm also a "casual" player =D|`|E3JLBFZgaa	i play on insane on co-up, you get a lot of the achievements this way. Playing co-up is the best b/c you have another human who plays smarter the Artificial intelligence and its a lot more fun. I started out on casual too, but as you go on, you'll get better and eventually master insane- just stay at it. Hope i helped!|`|NxAE5ivSaa	i usually complete the game on easy first... then complete it again on the hardest difficulty setting!|`|jgdtsqzfaa	check out this site, they give you an xbox 360 FOR FREE!! i got mine last week and i'm luuuuvin' it!|`|k486mEM0aa	I do it on insane on co-op but hardcore is good if u just bought the game.

RKIt9zSIaa	It works just like regular woohoo - does your regular woohoo work?  It's either going to be a problem with woohoo throughout the game, a conflicting hack or you've not read the instructions carefully enough and put in two (or more) conflicting flavour packs.  <br>  <br>  1. Check regular woohoo is working<br>  2. If it isn't, do a hack check<br>  3. If it is, read the instructions again carefully.<br>  4. Make sure you have the right version of Inteen for your game - what EPs do you have and do you have?  You need the version for the latest EP you have.

awTwyIbYaa	No. The lower the form the more moves you can get, If you have a pokemon and raise it to level 90 without evolving it it will get all the moves so you can eveolve it safley.|`|X25ZcFZyaa	they can... if you keep them at there 1 stage they learn moves fatser but if you let them evolve early on they get stronger but dont learn some of the moves

The most distinguishing feature about Runescape is that there aren’t many online games like it. Runescape is a browser based game that is played for free by the majority of its players. It was created back in 2001 and was a relatively new entrant on the scene of MMO games. It has a fantasy setting like most other online MMO games that is adventure based with loads of quests to complete and skills to develop.<br>  <br>  I holp the site can help u:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.runescapemaner.cn" rel="nofollow">http://www.runescapemaner.cn</a><br>  <a href="http://runescapemaner.cn/runescapemaner.cn/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://runescapemaner.cn/runescapemaner....</a><br>  <a href="http://runescapemaner.cn/runescapemaner.cn/runescape-gbp.html" rel="nofollow">http://runescapemaner.cn/runescapemaner....</a>|`|Y510zWjzaa	the maximum u can get is yearly membership|`|fd2auzJcaa	No, you can't.<br>  <br>  You don't have to manually pay for each month, it automatically takes 5 dollars from your account, and you can cancel at any time.

Good Luck!|`|63Oh3zTmaa	i don't know about magmar but pinsir is in the safari zone on certain days.

TcD197MJaa	musical chairs lol|`|Enk9j8Fpaa	spin the bottle|`|Sw05w3iraa	Games:<br>  <br>  1) My sister said this was a big hit with the kiddies AND the adults:<br>  Big Bowl/Bucket of uncooked rice, mix w/ container of paper clips. Blindfolded 30 seconds to take out as many clips as you can.<br>  <br>  2) Dizzy Bat Races<br>  <br>  3) tug-o-war<br>  <br>  4) Musical Chairs<br>  <br>  5) I still love the blow up size pic of the birthday boy or girl and pin the tassles or penis on the pic<br>  <br>  6)  Hot Potato<br>  <br>  7) Egg Drop<br>   In each pair the partners stand with their backs to each other. They have an egg between  their backs (or a little bit lower). The object is to put an egg on the ground, so as not  to break it. The pair which succeeds in it wins the game. Instead the egg you may a small  rubber ball. In this case the object of the game is to put the ball on the ground so as it  doesn't roll.<br>  <br>  8) Limbo<br>  <br>  9)Pass The Orange, Ball, etc...<br>   Arrange for teams of about 8 to stand in a line, one behind the other (arranged boy, girl, boy,...). Give each team an orange which the first person should tuck under his chin. This should be passed to the person behind. When the orange gets to the last person, they come to the front of the line and start again. The winnnig team is the first one which gets their starting person to the front again. <br>  <br>  10)  Toothpick - Lifesaver Race<br>   First divide your group into 2 teams, each team will need to be lined up facing the forward. Then take a bunch of toothpicks, give each person a tooth pick and then the person at the beginning of the line gets the lifesaver. Before you begin everybody puts the toothpicks into their mouth and then the captain (first person in line) puts a lifesaver on the toothpick. the object is to pass the lifesaver from team member to team member using only the toothpick, no hands! The first team to pass it down to the end end of the line wins.<br>   If the lifesaver falls on the floor then you must start at the beginning again. (Another variation that it is easier is straws and pretzels)

HYcyeOgNaa	You'll know Route 227 by the weather change. The falling ash won't affect your battles. Jump the ramp at the top and slaughter this guy's Pokemon. Ace Trainer Saul Tauros L55 Money: 3300 Jump the ramp and fight his friend. PKMN Ranger Felicia<br>  Lickitung L57; Vigoroth L57 Money: 3420<br>  Head left to see a scene between you, Crasher Wake, and your friend.<br>  Afterwards, head up into the house to take a rest. Make sure you say no or<br>  you'll end up resting forever. Go up the steps to your right ride across the<br>  log to the right for a scene with Buck. Go left to the grass and jump down.<br>  Climb down the wall and pick up the Charcoal, a hold item that powers up Fire-<br>  type attacks. Climb back up the wall, ride across the log, and pick up the Zinc<br>  to the left before fighting the girl.<br>  <br>  Ace Trainer Mikayla<br>  Meowth L56; Hypno L56; Persian L56<br>  Money: 3360<br>  <br>  Jump the ledge and go right, back up the log and into the grass.

The<br>  Life Orb is an interesting item. It strongly boosts attacks, but steals some HP<br>  away each time you attack. Go down the wall and jump the ledge on the left.<br>  Examine the rock for a Protein. Make your by back to the stairs by Griffin and<br>  head up the stairs.<br>  <br>  Up in the northeast corner is an Ether. The entrance to Stark Mountain is to<br>  the left.<br>  <br>  You'll find the same Pokemon here as Route 227, where you just came from.<br>  <br>  (( Stark Mountain (cave) ))<br>    Smash the rock and push the boulder right  and then down the stairs into the hole. Go left and find the Escape Rope Back at the big stairwell, push the top and bottom of these three boulders to the<br>    right, then push the middle one up or down<br>    out of the way. Go down and pick up the PP<br>   Up, then follow the path north, pushing and<br>   breaking rocks, picking up the Burn Heal and Full Restore by not pushing the boulder so it blocks your only path to it. Your friend's sitting at the entrance to the main area of the VERY large Stark Mountain.<br>  Enter and go a ways and you'll find Buck, who states that he just got done<br>  owning your friend. He suggests you team up, and so Buck joins your party. He,<br>  like the others before him, will completely cure your Pokemon after each fight.<br>  <br>  Head right. Go down the stairs above you, left into a battle.<br>  <br>  Bird Keeper Krystal and Black Belt Ray<br>  Dodrio L55; Tyrogue L53; Honchkrow L55; Fearow L55; Marowak L57; Breloom L58<br>  Money: 3152<br>  <br>  Go up from here, on the left side, then go down into the pit and collect a<br>  Calcium.

This is a really strong Fire-type special attack<br>  that drops the user's Special Attack sharply after each use.<br>  <br>  Backtrack now. When you get to the stairs, go up the ones on the left side. Go<br>  down the stairs above you and examine the wall at the end of the path for the<br>  Flame Plate. Now go back up the stairs and head straight down. Go down the<br>  stairs, then head up and around the pit. Follow the path to another battle.<br>  <br>  Ace Trainer Keenan and Ace Trainer Kassandra<br>  Primeape L57; Stantler L58; Torkoal L57; Carnivine L58<br>  Money: 6900<br>  <br>  Head down into the pit and pick up the Rare Candy, then go all the way back to<br>  the beginning, where Buck joined your party. Head right and go down the stairs.<br>  <br>  Head right, fight the people.<br>  <br>  Psychic Chelsey and Psychic Sterling<br>  Xatu L56; Baltoy L54; Mismagius L58; Grumpig L58<br>  Money: 3712<br>  <br>  Inside the pit to the far left is an Iron Ball. Go north of the psychics and<br>  head up the stairs. Go down for another battle.<br>  <br>  Ace Trainer Abel and Ace Trainer Monique<br>  Aerodactyl L59; Kangaskhan L57; Ursaring L57<br>  Money: 6960<br>  <br>  Go back down the stairs and head north.until you can turn left down a path. One<br>  more fight blocks your way.<br>  <br>  Veteran Harlan and Dragon Tamer Kenny<br>  Lourdred L56; Bagon L57; Shelgon L59; Tauros L56; Donphan L56<br>  Money: 6368<br>  <br>  Go up the stairs. To the left is a Max Revive. Go back down the stairs and<br>  follow the path down, left, down until you come across the first set of stairs.<br>  Go up these and head left. Go down the stairs above you and up into a battle if<br>  you so wish.<br>  <br>  Ace Trainer Skylar and Ace Trainer Natasha<br>  Loudred L57; Dunsparce L56; Rampardos L57; Marowak L56; Scyther L56<br>  Money: 6780<br>  <br>  Smash the rock to your left. Go left and up the stairs to another fight.<br>  <br>  Dragon Tamer Drake and Black Belt Jarrett<br>  Vibrava L57; Machamp L59; Seadra L57; Dragonair L57<br>  Money: 3240<br>  <br>  Follow the path left and go down the stairs. Push the boulder all the way to<br>  the right. Go up the stairs and Buck will leave your party. Now that he's gone,<br>  you can abuse Rock Climb and take some shortcuts.<br>  <br>  Enter the next room and Buck will take the dungeon treasure, then leave. Exit<br>  this room and climb down the wall. Go down, up the stairs, and climb down into<br>  the pit. At the very end of the path is a Max Elixir.<br>  <br>  You can now climb the wall next to Krystal and Ray. An Ultra Ball lies in wait.<br>  <br>  Warp out of here with an Escape Rope. Fly to the Survival Area. If you can't,<br>  you didn't listen to me, so fly to the Fight Area and head north from there and work your way backwards to the Survival Area.<br>  <br>  Enter the house next to the Pokemon Center to find Buck, on his way back to<br>  Stark Mountain to put the treasure, the Magma Stone, back where he got it from.<br>  Turns out that by taking that out, the volcano Pokemon could cause an eruption.<br>  <br>  If you go back to where Buck got the Magma Stone, you will find Heatran there.<br>  Don't forget to save before you fight it, and, providing you still have it,<br>  don't waste your Master Ball on it. It's a monster at L70 and is Fire/Steel in<br>  type. It knows Scary Face, which sharply lowers your Speed, Fire Spin, which<br>  prevents you from escaping, and two strong attack moves, Lava Plume and Iron<br>  Head. Lava Plume may cause burns, and Iron Head may cause flinching.<br>  <br>  A good Water-type will have lots of fun against Heatran as it resists both Fire<br>  and Steel. Good luck.|`|sBYp3dISaa	Stark Mountain<br>  at the second part go to the far end than go right up, down and up.<br>   than go to the girl house and she will return it and you will instead of the rock, heatran|`|rtszJVHBaa	I like eggs

Go down the slope and head right along the walkway to locate a nice Mini SMG. You'll also find a pistol in Sweet's backyard.<br>  <br>  Hint: Easy Body Armor<br>  Go out behind the house and into the aqueduct to the left. Go down the sloped wall of the aqueduct and head left. On an incline underneath the bridge, you'll find a handy vest.<br>  <br>  Hint: Easy Money for Cleaning the Hood<br>  Anytime you kill a drug dealer, you will net $2000. Drug dealers normally wear black jackets (some have white hoodies) and stand still waiting for people to talk to them. Kill as many as you can find to build up your cash stash quickly.<br>  <br>  Hint: Snapshots<br>  At 12:01 AM in San Fierro all of the snapshot areas glow.<br>  <br>  Hint: GTA3<br>  In the mission "Wu Zi Mu," your "girlfriend" will start to attack you and leave you for the character you play as in GTA3. The mission has you racing against him and 2 others. After the race they leave for Liberty city.<br>  <br>  Hint: Secret Weapon<br>  To find a unique weapon, head to the Police Department in Los Santos (or just get "Busted"). Enter the building and walk to the shower room. You'll find a sex toy that can be used as a melee weapon.<br>  <br>  Hint: Quick Hood Defence<br>  While playing the game, your hood will undergo attacks from other factions. To save yourself some time and end these disaster quickly, simply jack any vehice in which you can access extra missions using R3 (i.e., police vehicles, fire vehicles, taxicabs, ambulance, et al.). Start and end the extra mission (press R3 and exit the vehicle) and your hood will no longer undergo attack.<br>  <br>  Hint: Super Bunny Hop<br>  Grab a bicycle (this works better if your bike skills are all the way up) make sure you have a weapon you can fire on your bike, hold down L1, right. As you release L1 to bunny hop fire your gun (your timing must be perfect but it gets easier), if your bike skills are high you will be able to clear stop lights and get on top of sum buildings easily! This comes in handy!<br>  <br>  Hint - 2P Select-A-Drive-By-Shooting<br>  During co-op, you can use the weapon codes to alter the weapon used for drive-bys. Once you have a "normal" drive-by weapon, expend all the ammo and select a different weapon (rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and grenades are invalid).<br>  <br>  Board a vehicle with the selected weapon and input any weapon cheat again (refills ammo). The weapon you selected will now be usable for drive-by mode.<br>  <br>  Glitch: Zap The Hood<br>  When attempting a take over of a hood, exploit the game by looking for a nearby body of water deep enough for CJ to actually swim in.<br>  <br>  Get into the water then swim back out and a message will apear claiming that the hood is yours.<br>  <br>  Easter Egg: No Easter Egg<br>  Fly up to the southern support beam of the Gant Bridge with the jet pack for a special message.<br>  <br>  Easter Egg: Hoodlum Noteriety<br>  When you finish some missions (for example: 555 we tip) listen to the radio. You'll hear the person talking about the mission just passed.<br>  <br>  Easter Egg: Rockstar Cameos<br>  In one of Zero's mission, where you have to use the machine gun to knock down the RC planes, you can see some action figures of Rockstar characters like Tommy Vercetti, Lance Vance, as well as characters from other games in Rockstar's line-up during Zero's dialogue.<br>  <br>  Hint: Bullet Proof Cars<br>  During the mission "High Stakes, Low Rider", keep the competition closely behind you until the pier finish line. Once the race is over the other cars appear behind you.<br>  <br>  With another car or by just walking, push Ceasar's red car up the pier and over the edge of the sidewalk into your nearby safe house garage to the left. What's the point of all this? Not only is it a pimp red car, it's also BULLET PROOF, which helps alot this early in the game.<br>  <br>  Easter Egg: Inside-Out-Town<br>  Note: This will corrupt your save file due to the cheat involved; for best results, pull out your PS2 memory card prior to your attempt.<br>  <br>  1. Go to the gym in Ganton<br>  2. Kill all 4 people inside.<br>  3. Use the jetpack cheat.<br>  4. Walk to the yellow marker with the jetpack, and fly straight up. You'll go straight up through the roof. Now, land on the roof.<br>  5. Fly 2 blocks east, and you'll see a yellow marker. Land right on/near the marker, take off the jetpack, and walk inside the marker.<br>  6. You'll enter the Angel Pine Motel building. Grab your jetpack (if you see it), or respawn it again with a cheat.<br>  7. You can now fly up, and around the interior universe.|`|cKGjXLUmaa	googling aja.|`|dWT9iAkmaa	Can you speak indonesian?

AA10478980	My daughter plays regularly in an organized poker club.  She says it is about 25% luck and 75% strategy.  She wins much more than she loses, and therefore it cannot be mostly luck.  She reads a great deal about the psychology of playing poker, and she says it works.  She has learned how to "read" other players, and can almost always guess now what other players are holding, even players she has not played against before.  There is also the mathematical part of it and knowing the chances of getting a particular card, and the chances of the other players having certain combinations.|`|jsztMEvDaa	I think it's more strategy.|`|y822j5h5aa	I have learned over the years that the more I learn about poker, facts, data, statistics, percentages, betting strategy, playing strategy and probabilities, and the more I practice and gain experience, the luckier I get.<br>  <br>  Luck happens when planning, preparation and opportunity meet.<br>  <br>  Luck is very predictable.

Unless you have very bad luck, a skilled player will end up winning.<br>  <br>  Online poker is rigged for action flops and maximizing profit.  You'll see 1.5-4x as many monster hands depending on the site.  And find it common that 2 people will both hit monsters on the flop that neither player can get away from. <br>  <br>  MTT's are a lot about luck.  Even at $50 buy-in's. You have to survive many subpar players who will not fold with marginal holdings and suck out more on average because the RNG engine is set up that way.  And you have to survive Maniac players.  Those who constantly raise, re-raise, and raise again no matter what the position or what they are holding.|`|1DmGSZeHaa	Its definately a game of strategy. the luck comes from the turn of the cards but the skillful players will close out before the river card is turned. <br>  <br>  That being said when playing in freeroll tournaments you will find that poker players are more likely to bet till the end simply because they have no money staked and are trying to bank chips early on. <br>  <br>  I have written an article about the psychology of playing in freeroll tournaments which might be of use to you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.livethedreampoker.com/post/2008/10/28/Investigating-the-Psychology-of-Freeroll-Tournaments.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.livethedreampoker.com/post/20...</a>|`|2fMVB8FBaa	Texas Hold 'Em in my opinion is no doubt a game of strategy. Yeah, you can get a lucky hand, but if you don't know how to strategically be on your pocket aces then you won't do so well.

ThunderPunch/Stone Edge and Swords Dance work wonders, plus a Jolly nature would make it better.<br>  <br>  Electivire: standard stuff, so no problems here.<br>  <br>  Salamence: drop the Impish nature. Does it no favors. If you want a mix, Draco Meteor, Fire Blast/Flamethrower, Brick Break, Roost/Crunch is better, with a Mild or Rash nature.<br>  <br>  Tyranitar: again, nature does it no favors, as Lax kills its Sp. Defense, which is bad, since Sandstorm boosts it. Besides, raising its defense won't do it any favors since Infernape will kill it with Close Combat anyways. An Adamant nature would be, but your moveset suggests mix. Stone Edge or Crunch would be better. Fire Blast over Flamethrower, Ice Beam over Thunderbolt. Rash, though dropping Sp. Defense, is a better nature in this case.<br>  <br>  Milotic: Lonely? Horrible...Milotic should never use physical attacks, and should never lower her Defense! A Bold nature is better. Dragon Pulse is pretty useless on her, especially since Ice Beam takes care of Dragons. Surf is better than Aqua Tail (since Surf is a Special Attack).<br>  <br>  Metagross: Adamant nature. Drop Psychic for Thunderpunch. Hammer Arm is slightly questionable...Agility can be surprising for opponents.|`|Mw13IJBSaa	Nice team, try using Psychic headbutt on Metagross since he is more of a physical attacker and psychic headbutt will deal damage as a physical psychic move, take away Razor claw from him since it doesn't do much this day and age. Tyranitar should know crunch since it does get the dark type same bonus and take away thunderbolt since his special attack sucks. I love your Electivire since mine have the same move set and item. Your Milotic should know surf instead of aqua tail since its move accurate. Try Dragon Dance on your Salamence instead of Brick Break or flamethrower.|`|LLSQsVdVaa	get a pikachu.
29d5c162a8bacb0ea1e0278926ea41e5aa	Hi!<br>  We make those playdough-type ornaments every year, but those break when dropped. Last year, we made VERY HARD non-edible gingerbread houses using this recipe:<br>  <br>  -  4 cups flour<br>  - 1 cup salt<br>  - 1 teaspoon alum<br>  - 1 1/2 cups water<br>  - Ginger and cinnamon for color and gingery smell<br>  - Food coloring (we divided the clay and added coloring to the portion without the ginger)<br>      <br>  Mix flour, salt, alum, and water in bowl. Add ginger and cinnamon if you want the whole batch to be gingerbread-y. Knead until smooth. If the dough is too dry, knead in more water a tablespoon at a time. <br>  <br>  If it's not dark enough, you can get copper colored bakers food coloring at Michael's and elsewhere. <br>  If you divided the dough for other colors, add your food coloring by kneading it in a few drops at a time.<br>  <br>  Roll the dough about 1/8 inch thick on a *lightly* floured surface. Cut with a floured knife or cutter into shape. You can also mold the dough into figures--we made animals, trees, etc. They shouldn't be more than a half an inch or so thick.<br>   <br>  Place your shaped dough on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes at 250oF. Turn and bake another 90 minutes until hard and dry.<br>   <br>  After cooking and cooling, this really does work best if you smooth your walls and edges with fine sandpaper.<br>  <br>  Decorate!<br>  <br>  The recipe can be doubled. Also, we had the best success at rebaking by taking the walls out a bit before they were 'done.' We just watched them and took them out when they seemed hard. Those we left in for the full baking time turned out okay too though, because we sanded the toasty browness off the surface, so it didn't burn when rebaked. <br>  <br>  The hardest clay I've ever made is Sand clay, which dries as hard as stone--literally--when dry. It doesn't really fit the gingerbread theme, but may work for some of your scenery if you get as elaborate as we did (although it tends to look beachy if you don't find a way to make it blend in. It works great if your gingerbread men are surfers! :)). Leftover can be stored in an airtight container and it works great in plastic molds too. Although it's not bakeable, I'll include it just because it's the hardest clay I've ever made. Maybe it'll come in handy someday!<br>  <br>  3 cups sand<br>  1 ? cups cornstarch<br>  3 teaspoons alum or cream of tartar <br>  2 ? cup hot water<br>  <br>  Mix the DRY ingredients in a saucepan that you don't mind scratching up. Add hot water and stir vigorously. Add food coloring if desired. Cook over medium heat until it's very,very thick and can't be stirred anymore. Cool slightly and model. Allow to dry. Store left-overs in airtight container. |`|5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	Since you're making a gingerbread house (presumably not a miniature one) and want the greatest strength (not edibility), you'll probably want to use an "architectural dough" rather than some of the regular gingerbread doughs that can be used.  The recipe given by the previous answerer may be one of those, or check out these sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gingerbread+house+dough" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=gingerbre...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know if those doughs would be re-bakeable (or if they'd darken too much) for the time and temp required by polymer clay, but you could try a scrap piece to find out.<br>  <br>  You could also shape your polymer clay embellishments (right on the house if necessary), remove them, bake (cool in place if nec. first), then glue them back onto the house after baking.<br>  <br>  You could make the house itself out of (brown) polymer clay too ... quite large panels of polymer clay can be used alone (or with armatures) to build structures of all kinds.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in making gingerbread houses from polymer clay, or just in making polymer clay embellishments to put on them, you might want to check out this page at my site:<br>  <a href="http://glassattic.com/polymer/houses_structures_gingerbread.htm" rel="nofollow">http://glassattic.com/polymer/houses_str...</a><br>  ...click on GINGERBREAD, but also click on some of the other houses that are discussed in categories above that to see what kinds of structures are possible with polymer clay<br>  <br>  <br>  HTH,<br>  <br>  Diane B.

Some people say the mote extractor makes them a lot of gold, others aren't impressed by it.  It's up to you what toon you want it on and also how often you'll use the extractor.  There's also a +45 stamina trinket.|`|RX1cKkD2aa	In a way it's useful for rogues, my rogue actually took up engineering, since you have your druid for leather crafting you might just want to take anything you want on the rogue, in the end you will be able to make a flying mount, so that's one good point. :)|`|8CF8KZzZaa	The same thing I have for my guys<br>  Rogue will have poisons and Lockpicking when higher levels<br>  <br>  Mining/Jewelcrafting or Engineering /Mining are good ones ssince you have a skinner/leatherworking allready
YUsDTV0baa	Did you ever hear the old Dr. Pepper commercial where the jingle went "I'm a pepper, he's a pepper, wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?"<br>  <br>  Just replace pepper with Donkey and you've got it. We all play, and we will all have our Donkey moments, some will be brilliant, some much less so. <br>  <br>  If I was at the table, I'd probably have looked at the guy and said "eeaww"<br>  <br>  Pre-flop QQ is only going to get beaten by KK or AA. The odds of that are silm, and will usually happen to me more often then I care to remember. (I'm a bad player, with even worse luck) <br>  <br>  All flippancy aside, he achieved what he wanted to. He got under your skin. Poker is as much about the mental game as anything else. Far too many people feel that by being a$$holes, it helps them be more effective players.  In some cases it works, in some cases it doesn't. <br>  <br>  You had the best hand, and possibly in 2nd place walked away with some money. Good job. Just remember if you keep playing poker, this won't be the last time you see an outburst like that. <br>   |`|LJY29QCOaa	of course, he's the dumbass......|`|MPd34Ygoaa	He's a Dumb ***~<br>  He's jealous of you, because he got 9th and you got 2nd...<br>  Well, just ignore him...|`|v2hmNjOwaa	Seems like you played it just fine.<br>  <br>  That doesn't sound like a donkey play to me, but you didn't mention how big the blinds were, what position this guy and you were both in, and how big your stacks were.<br>  <br>  If, say, the blinds are very low and this guy and you both have a crapload of chips, him going all-in pre-flop could mean aces, kings, or AK.<br>  <br>  Here's a hand I was in where I got in trouble calling all-in with queens:<br>  Table had nine players, I was in about 6th position, blinds were at very first level or maybe second level, and no one was really a short stack.  My hand: QQ.  The guy right after the blinds (3rd position) min-raised, two people called.  I re-raised to 4x his raise (8 BBs), everyone folds around to him, and he goes all-in.  Two original callers fold, i think about it for a bit then call.  He has pocket aces and gets all my chips except maybe five big blinds.  I get knocked out a few hands later when my AJ is beaten by AQ.<br>  <br>  Aces vs. Queens isn't gonna happen very often, but you have to be a little bit careful with pocket queens.|`|AA11022305	Well obviously his abusing you and you should leave him alone. If he keeps on doing this and you keep on ignoring him he would finally leave you alone as you can't be stirred up.

Don't take it personally.|`|y822j5h5aa	You made the right call pre-flop. <br>  <br>  Don;t worry about what other players say to you in chat, often they are trying to make you made so they will putyou on tilt.<br>  <br>  Don't fall for it, in fact when they do it, just say thank you. It drives them crazy and may even put them on tilt, lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If the glue is applied to other surfaces, or if the jar is left open, the solvent evaporates and the glue sticks to whatever surface it's on, including the jar.|`|66874a788ece12b1d2f60860e0ae8cc1aa	because it is not exposed to air
OpwGkBGsaa	One of my favorites is Sol Ring, probably one of the best mana accelerators in the game.  It sits only right behind Black Lotus and the same par as the 5 Moxes, and several hundred dollars less to boot!<br>  <br>  It has been a staple to almost all of the decks I've ever made.  The only reason why it's not P10 is because Sol Ring wasn't rare.|`|l6lh6fT8aa	I love Mystic Snake. It's just great card advantage, especially when paired with cards like Repulse that allow you to bounce it back to your hand for another go. I have a total of 9 Mystic Snakes, 4 of which are in my regular U/G deck, 1 of which is in my EDH U/G deck, and 4 are in my 5-color Extended control deck.|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	My favorite card? Without counting for power, my favorite card is Akroma, Angel of Wrath. She is so sexy, and while other babes in Magic die to a shock or incinerate, Akroma stands tall and proud. Once she is on the board, it is hard for your opponent to win. She doesn’t die from black removal spells, she can’t be burned, she flies, tramples, first strikes, and has vigilance. What more can you ask for? (She earns a place in my legacy and my vintage dredge decks.)<br>  <br>  My next favorite card, sitting right behind Akroma, is Tarmogoyf. This little creature received no mention when it first crawled out of the time tunnels of Future Sight. Then, people noticed that it can become an 8/9 for TWO MANA without any drawbacks. It’s price went from two dollars to fifty dollars literally overnight. Let Wizards find a way to introduce Lhurgoyfs back into the game with a 4/5 5/6 creature for two mana. Tarmogoyf==good. Any deck+Tarmogoyf == good. It’s that simple.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that Helped!|`|m1vmXBIHaa	One of  my favorite cards would have to be Cryptic Command. For the extra U its worth it. You get a counter, a card draw, tap opponents creatures, or return any permanent. <br>  <br>  My second card would have to be Damnation. White and Black are so much the polar opposite of each other that for 5 years I had been waiting for another Wrath of God practically begging. When it finally came out i was practically salavating. And besides, what other cards allows you to say Damnit when you play it. lol I mean besides Cryptic Command?|`|d3c656280908048351759f2b85cf85e8aa	my favorite card is serra angle.  She is my favorite mostly because she was my first card.  i like having a 4/4 flying creature that doesn't tap to attack.  <br>  <br>  my next favorite card is counter spell.  just because i like messing with my opponents deck.|`|YUsDTV0baa	Rabid Wombat. <br>  <br>  For the following reasons:<br>  It gets tougher when you give it weakness.<br>  It's Vombato Rabbioso in Italian.

Flip over the puzzle and paint on glue on backside. Be careful not to use so much that it seeps to the front.<br>  <br>  Another less messy option is to apply contact paper to the back of the puzzle and trim the sides.

sVtiLg6Eaa	I have a feeling if you can't kill Cletus,you can't kill the convicts. So here's another idea if that doesn't work.<br>  Leave the area by Cletus and go straight to the turn in the hallway,go through the empty store there and out the back to another hallway. Take out the Security guards and take their guns. Go back to the area outside the gunstore. You might want to pick up some other weapons on the way,like the lead pipe and such. And bring some OJ or food too!<br>  Clean out all the zombies there so you're not attacked while getting Cletus. Open the left door and run back. Aim through the open door with as little of Frank exposed as possible. As Cletus is walking behind the counter pop of a couple of rounds.He might get you once or twice,so use your food to power up after he does. It will take a bit of time,but you should be able to get him this way pretty easily.|`|KBHzTjhvaa	Kill the convicts in the park, then dismount their gun and shoot him with that.

66874a788ece12b1d2f60860e0ae8cc1aa	hi, i used to do this for a local restaurant...Dharma trading company has EVERYTHING you need.....you REALLY should order their procion dyes for vivid color that lasts....and make sure to pre-soak in soda ash to prepare the fibers....check out the page i have linked.....ALSO what i used to do as well, if you have a non-white shirt...you can dilute some bleach and use that for a reverse look...good luck|`|t6wW77Glaa	Make sure you soak the t-shirt first, it helps the dye soak in<br>  If you want a spiral design, pick a spot on the t shirt where you want it to begin and twist it until the shirt is in what looks like a cinnamon bun. Then section it off with rubber bands (so it now has sections like a pizza) and make each section a different color. Make sure you soak the t shirt with die and don't forget to flip it over (you probably want to do the same colors as on the front side). <br>  You can also make a striped design by folding the t shirt like an accordion or fan<br>  Another way to do it it just pick up the middle of the shirt and and tie rubber bands around the length of it. <br>  And then you could always just twist different parts and rubber band them, but i personally like the spiral design, it usually turns out really well

I went to a fair this weekend and these ladies were selling their necklaces for $40+ but they were only made of inexpensive beads that you can get from michael's.  You have to make your prices cheap enough where people will buy them, but enough so that you're not losing money on labor and the materials.

TcD197MJaa	well its good, but your milotic should not use iron tail, since it has a higher special attack than attack stats. i woud teach it dragon breath instead.<br>  <br>  also i would switch the bronzong for the metagross since metagross is a stronger pokemon in general. if you do decide to use a metagross instead, i would teach it a physical attack instead of psychic, since metagross has a high attack stat.<br>  <br>  if you find a life orb then that is a useful item to give to pokemon as it gives their attacks a 50% power boost. the only downside is that it drains 10% of the holders health every time they attack the opponent sucessfully.<br>  <br>  and of course im sure you already know this but they are better at lv 100, so you should train them up. i suggest that you use your vs seeker in the route just above the fight area (route 225) where there are 3 trainers. they have fairly high level pokemon and are quick and easy to defeat. also you can heal any time you want as the fight area is right next to it. and of course theres the league<br>  <br>  sorry, big answer|`|GGSpgre7aa	Milotic is good.<br>  Dragonite should learn Flamethrower instead of Fire Punch<br>  Bronzong should learn Flash Cannon instead of Gyro Ball.<br>  Miltank should know Giga Impact instead of Earthquake and Dynamic Punch instead of Dizzy Punch.<br>  TogeKiss should know Sky Attack, Metronome, Aura Sphere and Solarbeam.<br>  Electivire should know Thunder, Iron Tail, Thunderpunch, and Hyper Beam.|`|0coOgP8Xaa	you have a good team but i would change miltank and replace it with like a rapidash or some thing because you have no fire pokemon and miltank is kind of worthless to me. you souldent replace bronzor because it is a stell/phycic wich i think is pretty good and his moves are pretty good to. other than that your team is very good.|`|fr180hSmaa	8\10 Keep you bonzong it is better that the other two.

Neways, a couple of things i might change are<br>  <br>  1. to many earthquakes....electrivire, and miltank (and bronzong, but i think u should get rid of him so we'll c later).....and not enough (or any) grass type moves. granted u dont NEED them b/c everything else is covere, but just throwong that out there, same with dark type moves also...<br>  2. Dragonite's Dragon rush is too unreliable. replace it with dragon claw, from the battle tower, dragonites massive attack makes up for the loss in power, and the gain in accuracy is well worth it. u can also use a heart scale to get back outrage, but that confuses dragonite......kinda up to u there....but i dont reccomend dragon rush<br>  3. Now those r the only problems....lol.....cool....now to the bronzong thing...<br>  to be blunt...replace it with the vespiquen......heres y....Bronzong is nice, but uneccesary seeing as all it does is repeat the moves other pokemon have elsewhere. now the common metagrossconundrum. metagross has high phys attack, but learns a lot of really stong sp. attk moves like Psychic, Sludge Bomb, Meteor Mash.....and u dont need another earthquake. <br>  So, well done and good luck

Vinegar is an acid and will eat the metal and salt will scratch the surface. Coke by the way does not do much but make a sticky mess if left in it till it drys. Coke will not do anything that is an old wives tale. Cleaned coins are valued a lot less than non cleaned ones and if a coin is harshly cleaned it may lose all value. The best thing to do is leave them alone. |`|zGkqGZzYaa	Coin collectors recommend not to clean any coins it de-values them, copper, or silver|`|cVcuOFTGaa	Collectible coins -- Don't polish them.<br>  <br>  That said, if they are already somewhat worn, a brisk rubbing on short pile carpet will buff up the highlights, leaving the recesses dark and making a very attractive coin.

It will soon tarnish again, however, a natural reaction to being in the environment.<br>  <br>  There may be other non-chemical, non-abrasive things that can be used to buff coins, but I've only ever used the carpet.  Just put it down, press down with one or two fingers, and rub back and forth like crazy.<br>  <br>  The water, salt, and vinegar thing works, but don't leave them in there too long.  I've learned the hard way that if forgotten, they will cement into a hardened mass of corroded coins.|`|cjtfvcOqaa	It's best not to clean coins.

YUsDTV0baa	Do you have a local Casino?<br>  How are you doing playing there?<br>  Have you found the private clubs in the city that you live in?<br>  <br>  The action isn't only in Vegas, but there certainly is more of it there. <br>  <br>  A friend of mine had built of a tremendous private stash. Bought a $5,000 engagement ring for his fiancee out of his bankroll and didn't blink. Three years later he tilted. Owed so much money at a private club he was forced to deal there every weekend, and was no longer allowed to deal. <br>  <br>  What happened to him sobered me up, and allowed me to keep my head above water. It's a great dream, but it's a hard life. <br>  Experience is really the only way to get better. Find local tournaments, when you start dominating them non-stop, start looking to travel to bigger tournaments near by. <br>  <br>  The recommendations above regarding online poker are also solid. Look at the number of contenders in the WSOP who have emerged simply from their online experience. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, think about the money, plan it out. How big is your bankroll. Where are you going to live? How much can you afford to set aside to live on? What are your buyins that you can afford? Will the return allow you to grow your bankroll while paying your way? How long can you afford to tilt?<br>  <br>  Also, how old are you, and what do you have to fall back on when you owe someone a lot of money?|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Good luck.<br>  <br>  You try on-line?  Nothing beats experience.

They recommend that you scrape the outside, let it sit for up to 2 weeks to age, before you cut it open.  It stated that you could put in freezer and it would speed up the aging process.  Once it has aged then using a dull knife cut it open, scoop out the center, and then you should be able to carve. But nothing was mentioned about spraying any sort of lacquer.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  |`|66874a788ece12b1d2f60860e0ae8cc1aa	I think it is a GREAT and very thoughtful gift!....I have candles made out of the coconut shell....not exactly sure how to get it smooth on the outside (removing the fuzzy stuff)....but once you clean the meat out u are set...(possibly wood burning??...that may work)...you MAY think about putting polyurethanene on it (this would help preserve your artwork as well!)....GOOD friends are hard to come by...i hope your friendship is everlasting....good luck!

154dzJ1Faa	What you want to do is make I-cord.  Cast on 3, 4, 5 or more stitches.  4 is the easiest to do, anything more than that, and you will have to latch up stitches later.<br>  <br>  Cast on, and knit one row.  DO NOT TURN your work!!  Slide the stitches back to the other end of the needle, and without turning the work, knit that row again. You will bring the yarn across the back of your work to the beginning stitch -- pull it up snug across the back.  Repeat this one row over and over, never turning your work, but always knitting from the front.  I know -- it sounds stupid, but it does indeed work.  You are in fact knitting in the round on a 4-stitch circle, which makes for that hollow-centred cord.|`|3iRl21Pqaa	It's a lovely technique and knits up quickly.  I first heard of it as 'iCord' (Idiot Cord!).  I'm currently doing a French Knitting project, but now wish I'd made it with this method.|`|AA12177717	Well, using a knitting nancy IS knitting, but what you're asking about is I cord.<br>  <br>  To knit I cord, cast on your stitches onto one double pointed needle.  Turn the needle so the working yarn is coming from the wrong side and push your slip knot to the other end of the needle.  Bring the working yarn around to the slip knot on the back and knit with the other needle.  Continue pushing the stitches to the other end of the needle so the yarn is at the far end and bring it around to knit each row.  Continue in this manner to your desired length and cast off.

I heard good things about the other three games, so I take it this one is as good.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	For a cheap but top-of-the-line war game, get StarCraft for the PC. It is very challenging, though. My favorite part of it is that it has a Level/Scenario maker where you can create a story from scratch and make awesome levels (VERY time consuming). It has three playable factions: Protoss (Advanced Aliens), Terran (Humans), and Zerg (Weak aliens that attack in swarms). StarCraft has 2 sets of campaigns for each race (1 with original and one with expansion StarCraft: Brood War)<br>  <br>  A new war/strategy game that just came out for Xbox 360 is Halo Wars. It is very, very cool. If you like the Halo universe, this is your chance to command the UNSC or the Covenant and fight on a grand scale of destruction. It is very fun and the graphics are crazy! The only thing bad about it is that it only has one campaign (UNSC). I wanted to see what the Covenant were up to!! :( oh well. It still is a great game.<br>  <br>  You should get em both, just for keeps ;)

82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Once upon a time, this was possible. When Mirrodin was in standard, the Affinity deck was all commons – 4x of every artifact land, 4 Frogmite, 4 Myr Enforcer, 4 Cranial Plating… but those days are past.<br>  <br>  Now, it is almost impossible to build a competitive deck with all commons. Granted, there are decks that are like this, but they are hardly competitive. A good deck will have very little commons, though some of the best cards in Magic are common, and will likely remain this way for the rest of the lifetime of the game.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|X9kNbpnQaa	No, it is not possible. The Rares, especially the newer ones, are by far the best cards that come out. The best lands for multicolor decks are rares, requiring them if you want a truly competitive multicolor deck. Rares are normally what packs the OOMPH in a deck. They cost less for their abilities, have a wider variety of effects, and use more complex and useful combinations (including infinite combos).<br>  <br>  There is an infinite combo made of Quill Spike and Devoted Druid, but QS is an uncommon.|`|564ee4b5ea2667913f447171f891dd07aa	In a "real" tournament - FNM, a PTQ, etc - it is very hard to win building a deck with all commons.  I have made a few decks that do fairly well, such as a suicide black deck, a red/green poison deck, etc, but they won't win tournaments.<br>  <br>  Having said that, most decks have commons in them to varying degrees, even if they are only basic lands.  You really need to build the deck to have win conditions and good card interaction, regardless of the rarity of the cards.|`|1vRegzdAaa	Well, it depends on the cards you're using. id say most likly not but if you have all commons that just work perfect togeather then thats different, but i highly doubt that and i wouldnt try it because u'd just be wasting the money on the entry fee|`|sbwi2hm5aa	Yes Thoughtseize is a $25 Card THink It's Good. U Can But For Good Commons It'll Be Just As Exspensive As A Deck Of Rares.|`|XiOfPxpdaa	the "high and mighty" cards are bought to biuld a deck around (you only need 1 or 2) but the best of decks are made from commen cards cuzz it's not over-all power that's ganna win no matter what they say to you it's the work you can do with your deck and your partners my deck beat a natinal champ, and it was a hero deck mainly cuzz i don't revolve the hole deck around summoning 1 spesifect type such as fusions (wich ids very easy to counter) so who knows you might be saprized at what a deck of commen cards can do if it's biuled right and if you can work together with it ^_^|`|DQyHwIeiaa	There is, as far as i know the best deck int he world for magic is a burn deck of all commons.<br>  <br>  Just google it ^_^

iENoAA84aa	Pretty medioka in my opinion...I'd give you 4 out 10.....sorry.<br>  <br>  You must get 1 or 2 "Flute of Summoning Dragon" spell cards.....these are an extremely powerful card when Lord of D. is on the field as it allows you to special summon upto 2 dragons (any level). They are cheap and easy to get!<br>  <br>  My favourite dragon card is "White Horned Dragon"......as it is so easy to power up by removing spell cards from your opponents graveyard (to a max of 3700 or 3900 if "Mountain" is on the field). Compared to DAD it is very cheap and easily obtainable.<br>  <br>  Dragon decks used to be the best......but unless you spend hideous amounts they are very average now days.<br>  <br>  Good luck anyway!!!<br>  <br>  Yu-Gi-Oh ROCKS!!!|`|QPEBaSzhaa	Add Five Headed as a beatstick , and i dont think 2 lusters are that good, drop it to 1 otherwise great deck 8.9/10|`|TqeuXRLDaa	5 headed dragon comes from the dinosaurs rage special edition starter deck|`|aQGiHQTkaa	well its a nice deck because if we see that ur using a dragon deck its cool i use them too magician deck and dragon decks ut i would say to u that ur deck is cool but  it would be nice if u would make an x2 bottomles trap hole otherwise its all nice|`|1tZtbozKaa	Add five headed dragon.

8b133fbdc954ed301ed95aaec46bc65aaa	metal needles come is sizes 000-35<br>  the kinds that they come in are interchangeable sets, straight, circularn double pointed.|`|AA12177717	Actually, metal needles come in sizes from 8 aught (00000000) up to as large as US 19's, although I have seen 35's and 50's in aluminum over the years.  Most needles are now sized metrically other than in the US, where they are also sized with both metric and US sizes.  Older needles from Europe may have the same numeric sizes as current US sizes, but be the opposite diameter because of a different sizing system in place until about the 1950's.  Also US needles from one brand to another may be the same *size* number but are not the same diameter.  There is no standardization of US sizes.  To ensure that your needles are the same size (and this also applies to crochet hooks) go by the metric size rather than the US size.<br>  <br>  Circular and straight needles generally come in the same sizes from 0 through 19, but larger sizes generally only come in straight needles.  Double points can come from the 8 aught size, again up to about size 17 and sometimes 19.|`|IUpIHFTKaa	I found this information on a web site with basic information.<br>  Below are 2 great links for beginning knitters and crocheters.<br>  <br>  Straight knitting needles, which come in aluminum, plastic or wood, are the most commonly used. They come in varying sizes, from 0 (2 mm), the smallest, to size 15 (10 mm) and larger; they are sold in pairs, and come in 10" or 14" lengths. There is a point at one end of the needle, and a knob at the other, which prevents stitches from slipping off. <br>  <br>  For large projects like afghans, or sweaters that can be worked in a tube without a seam, "circular knitting needles" can be used. These are long flexible needles with points at both ends. For smaller projects that do not have seams (socks and mittens) "double-pointed knitting needles" are used. These come in sets of four and as their name suggests, there is a point on each end.
TvwxvhMxaa	Well, I do not exactly know how it came to be, but if you think about it. The definition of the word "Own" it means, someone's possessions of sorts. So by Owning someone, meaning they were so badly beaten, that they are now owned by that other person, metaphorically speaking. Its just another insult in video games.<br>  <br>  And as for Pwn. It probably started when someone accidentally misspelled Own, Since the P is right next to the O, it accidentally came out Pwn, and just started hooking into everyday gaming, just like Fad's and such.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question :D|`|WfHRRCZfaa	Pwn comes from hacker jargon meaning to control an electronic device without authorisation (for example, jailbreaking an Ipod touch or Iphone is sometimes call pwning it, and the program used to do this most of the time is called QuickPwn)<br>  <br>  Own doesn't really have a reason for it's existence, It came about during online gaming to express the margin by which you beat the opposition <br>  <br>  Eventually, people familiar with hacking started using pwn (mainly because the "p" looks like a bleeding "o")

I am working on a Magic: The Gathering port to the iPhone, but it is very difficult and I don’t have much time to spend on it. I don’t know if it is possible to do this over a phone, as Magic is a very complicated game, and coding the rules enforcer will already be hard, not to mention all of the other effects.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

LwYt5eNMaa	Some legendaries are under used but a lot are uber. Pokemon like Mewtwo, Lugia, Raquaza, Dialga etc.. have really high stats and good moves. On the other hand pokemon like the regis aren't very good and moltres and articuno lose half their health to stealth rock but most of them are over used or uber. Mew is good as it can learn every tm and it's hard to tell what a mew will do. You could give it high attack, special attack or probably make it a small wall. One of the weather trio (groudon, kyroge, raquaza) is a must have and giratina is the ultimate wall. Arceus is like an improved version of mew and can change type and style easily. Lugia has good defenses while ho-oh is a good special attacker. Deoxys speed and attack can be damaging and don't forget the defense form. There's also special attacker darkrai, the powerful dialga and palkia and shaymin sky form is great as well. Mewtwo is awesome too. Don't forget about the less powerful but still over used legendaries like heatran, cresselia, celebi, jirachi, ukie, azelf, zapdos and suicine.

uX50g9Plaa	I think i know why. I had problems selling stuff too but then i figured it out.<br>  <br>  Okay when your at your shop, theres that shop menu thing on the top, right hand side corner. Click on the button that looks like a bill, with a simolean sign ( its the last button on that business menu thing so should be easy to find) Once you've clicked that, everything will go sort of dark. This is when you select the items you want to go on for sale. So in your case, you would click all the flowers you want to sell. Once you click this, it will set all the flowers at an average price, so you'll have to change their price after you have selected them for sale.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|XOF6jGXRaa	Are you sure they're marked for sale? if they're not then no one can buy them. if they are marked for sale then you should make them cheaper.|`|II5Yge0Naa	Do you have a sales person? usually if you have a sales person they go right up to them and ask them.

A standard piece of typing paper measures 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches.  So, if you fold it in quarters, the resulting size is 4 1/4 inches by 5 1/2 inches.  Thus, it will fit in the A2 size perfectly, with only enough excess space to allow you to slide the card in and then seal the flap.  If you tried the A6 size, it will have nearly an inch of extra room on the long side, and so it will not appear to fit correctly.

Hopefully in 2-3 weeks we will have them in the marketplace.<br>  <br>  :)|`|kYimiCMSaa	You are going to have to wait until the first of April which is when it comes out in the Marketplace<br>  And come on man!<br>  Give Halo wars a shot damnit! It rocks!|`|4IwVNpJ7aa	Sorry to tell you but it only came in the Limited Edition. You won't be able to get it until it comes out on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800MS in April or wait till Halo 3:ODST comes out towards the end of the year.<br>  You might have luck by going on an online auction website like Ebay or  Trade Me.|`|402a7e0976c4fd252a2d7a2b9222ef92aa	ur outta luck my friend until they release it on the marketplace... sorry dude<br>  <br>  <br>  try ebay--- thats not malicious i swear<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/items/__mythic-map-pack_W0QQQ5ftrkparmsZ72Q253A1205Q257C66Q253A2Q257C65Q253A12Q257C39Q253A1QQ_dmptZVideoQ5fGamesQ5fGamesQQ_trksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em14QQ_sopZ15QQ_scZ1" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/items/__mythic-map-...</a>|`|hRrSRt0Xaa	Simply put you cant, for the moment.
