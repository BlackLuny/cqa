I myself am doing pretty well - ha, I didn't go to school today because I was too lazy (so, yes, I skipped...shhh) and I got to sleep all day. Wonderful joyfulness.

What is your most valued anime or manga based item (if applicable - not counting manga itself)?          5. How many manga or anime series do you think you have watched in your life (approximately)?          6. Do you prefer five or ten questions to be asked in these? Should I continue with five plus bonus? (With this as an exception, of course)         Bonus Question:   Chinese food vs. Japanese food. Which do you prefer and why?

As many people know NCIS has tried to stay away from the characters personal lives which is best but now they are delving more into that.      You don't think they will try to hook Dinozzo and Ziva up do you?      If they were going to hook anyone up I would want them to hook them up.      But I don't want them to hook anyone up at the same time.  Its seems the shows are more successful if they focus on the case and not so much on the characters personal lives.      (thats were law and order SVU screwed up)         What do you think?      I think the show would be more successful if they leave well enough alone but I still want them to hook Ziva and Tony up.      You know      What do you think

However on the other hand, Beyonce does not legally have to get permission from Etta James as she already go the permission from the song writer and the producer. Although it would have been an honorable and respectable thing to. Etta James may have been bitter about not getting an invitation or wasn't asked to perform at President Obama's inaguration.

Lawyer Joke   10 Husbands, Still a Virgin            A lawyer married a woman who had previously divorced ten husbands.      On their wedding night, she told her new husband, "Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin."      "What?" said the puzzled groom.      "How can that be if you've been married ten times?"      "Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative: he kept telling me how great it was going to be.      Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.      Husband #3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.      Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.      Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.      Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.      Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.      Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.      Husband #9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.      Husband #10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was... God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!"      "Good," said the new husband, "but, why?"      "You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!"

20090205134118AA1nQqM	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	How different are Drake Bell and Josh peck? How are they alike?	I've picked them for my english essay and it needs to up to 3 pages.    This is what I typed      Through our exploration thus far of the epic tale of Beowulf, we have identified several characters that are foils to one another.  One example would be Drake and Josh from the TV show called “Drake & Josh”.  These characters have traits and qualities that contrast one another in order to draw out certain characteristics and make them more dynamic.          Drake Bell and josh Peck attend to the same school, but they were not aware that their parent was seeing each other.  Now not only they attend to the same school, they share a room and the same family. They become stepbrothers when Drake’s mother and Josh’s father get married. What make them foils as well as their nature as a “good guy” or “bad guy” is that they have different personalities.         Josh Nichols is a good guy who always obeys all the rules.  He is a super-smart kid, not a risk taker, sweet, nerd and unfortunate.  Drake Parker is a bad guy who cares less about school and easily gets girls. He is described as a troublemaker, attractive, lucky, stupid, and lazy.            I’ve remembered watching one of the episodes about    I can't remember the episodes. Give 1 or 2 examples when Drake Bell is more cuter than Josh and  when Josh Peck is more smarter than him.

We would like to hire a celebrity to do an informercial.  Because of the demographics of our clients, the celebrity would need to be 55-75 years old.        Probably male, although my boss has not yet decided on that.  The celebrity would need to have a conservative or neutral image.        Two of our competitors recently hired Robert Wagner and Hal Holbrook.  These two campaigns were very well done.  We are looking to do something similar.

20090205142309AAqGH5b	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Heres a joke..........................…	A policeman pulled over a car over and told the driver him that because...      ... he had been wearing his seat belt he had just won $500, in an Arrive Alive safety competition. The driver could hardly believe his luck.      "What are you going to do with your cash?" asked the cop      "Well I guess I'm going to get a drivers license," answered the driver.      "Oh, don't listen to him," yelled his friend in the passenger seat. "He tries to be smart when he's drunk."      This woke up Rodger in the back seat who took one look at the cop and moaned, "I knew we wouldn't get far in a stolen car."      At that moment there was a knock from the trunk and a voice said, "Are we over the border yet?"      lol ^_^

Recipe for the Perfect Marriage          * Two times a week we go to a nice restaurant, have a little beverage, good food and companionship She goes on Tuesdays; I go on Fridays.       * We also sleep in separate beds. Hers is in California , and mine is in Texas       * I take my wife everywhere.... but she keeps finding her way back.       * I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary. 'Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!' she said. So I suggested the kitchen.       * We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops.       * She has an electric blender, electric toaster and electric bread maker. She said 'There are too many gadgets, and no place to sit down!' So I bought her an electric chair.       * My wife told me the car wasn't running well because there was water in the carburetor. I asked where the car was. She told me, 'In the lake.'       * She got a mud pack, and looked great for two days. Then the mud fell off.       * She ran after the garbage truck, yelling, 'Am I too late for the garbage?' The driver said, 'No, jump in!'       * Remember: Marriage is the number one cause of divorce.       * I married Miss Right. I just didn't know her first name was Always.       * I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months I don't like to interrupt her.       * The last fight was my fault though. My wife asked, 'What's on the TV?' I said, 'Dust!'

20090205144557AA84xyL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Is anyone else pissed off at all the Twilight fans taking over?	I love the band Muse, but now all I see on youtube is how Twilight obsessed fans love SuperMassive Black Hole and how they think that they are a true fan. I've known about Muse way before Twilight came out, and now I am getting very annoyed at them. If I were to ask a Twilight fan who likes Muse a simple question such as who Matthew Bellamy is, would they know? Probably not. What about if I were to ask them what five songs of Muse are? The first would be Supermassive Black hole, I'm assuming. They probably would freeze up after the second song they managed to come up with.      I also see a lot of "Vampires" online. People who I am refering to, do not get me wrong, it's just a bit annoying. You are not a vampire. Get over it.      People agree/disagree/anything I missed?

Hi,      I have been going through all my old Trading Cards and stickers (All UK) and I came across some Batman Items that I would like to get some information on.      They are a set of Batman Iron-on transfers. I think I can remember that 1 came included with a packet of stickers.      They are made by Merlin Stickers. (Printed in Italy by AMZ Editrice).   They are dated 1989. They are of things like the joker, Pink Joker Van, Logo, Batmobile etc (all from the 1989 movie)      I have looked on Ebay and on the internet but I cant find any information. I have a friend who is into comics, trading cards etc and he thinks they are very rare. It would be good to get some information on them.      I know they are 100% genuine as I remember buying them when I was a kid. I just cant find info from Merlin or Trading cards sites!!!      If anyone has any idea or no of anyone I could email to get information from I would be appreciate it.      Thanks.

20090205135048AARdaXz	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Trying to find the name of a movie?	I saw it last year on DVD, someone rented it and I never saw the ending or got the name.  It took place during WW2. It a girl in her early 20's? Maybe it was a foreign film? They weren't in Germany but some other country and her family was rich and gave all their money to maybe a lawyer to save and keep and give them when they needed it. Her family was all dead and she was the only one left alive, she went to the lawyer and he set up a place for her to meet others on a boat and be taken out of the county but the lawyer betrayed her took all the money and told the Nazi's. They showed up and killed everyone on the boat but she survived. Then she went into town and dyed her hair blonde and pretended to be Jewish. She worked as a secretary for some Nazi soldiers. She started sleeping with one to get information to escape. He saw her pubic hair was dark so he freaked out and said he knew she was a Jew hiding?  I don't remember any more.   Sorry I know it sounds bad but it was really good. Maybe the actress was English?

Bale was so out of line in my opinion.  You don't treat other human beings like that, and the guy shouldn't have taken that from Bale.  He is an over-paid prima-donna actor.  Yes, he's a good actor, but that doesn't give him the right to verbally abuse and physcially threaten another person.  If I acted like that at my job, I would be fired in a heart beat, same with most people.

I really want to sing rihanna - cry, but i really don't want to do it acapella. Do you think its even rational of me to think that i could learn to play it on piano with no piano experience, from a friend. I have a friend who plays almost anything by ear, and i figured maybe she could teach me just this one song? plausible?   i would ask her to accompany me but, she's playing piano in the talent show so she can't.

Winter just wasn't my season"   Yeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes   Like they have any right at all to criticize,   Hypocrites. You're all here for the very same reason      'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable   And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table   No one can find the rewind button, girl.   So cradle your head in your hands   And breathe... just breathe,   Oh breathe, just breathe      May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss   "Just a day" he said down to the flask in his fist,   "Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year."   Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while,   But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles,   Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it.      Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,   And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.   No one can find the rewind button, boys,   So cradle your head in your hands,   And breathe... just breathe,   Oh breathe, just breathe      There's a light at each end of this tunnel,   You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out   And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again   If you only try turning around.      2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song   If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me,   Threatening the life it belongs to   And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd   Cause these words are my diary, screaming out loud   And I know that you'll use them, however you want to      But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,   And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table   No one can find the rewind button now   Sing it if you understand.   and breathe, just breathe   woah breathe, just breathe,   Oh breathe, just breathe,   Oh breathe, just breathe.

What is the name of a song that was playing in Starbuck's recently-- it doesn't have any real lyrics; just a man singing ba ba ba ba ba ba ba repetitively and at the same time a woman sings oooh oooh.  The beat of the song is kind of slow (both voices sing slowly) but it is still a good beat-- very modern. I have looked on itunes and all the other means of finding a song from Starbuck's, but I have had no luck. I haven't heard it anywhere else, so it must not be by a well-known group. Please ONLY answer if you think you know the name of the artist or the song. Thanks!

"What does it look like?" answered the young man. "I'm reading this magazine." Pointing towards the young lady in the back seat, the officer then asked, "And what is she doing?" The young man looked over his shoulder and replied, "What does it look like? She's knitting."      "And how old are you?" the officer then asked the young man. "I'm nineteen," he replied. "And how old is she?" asked the officer. The young man looked at his watch and said, "Well, in about twelve minutes she'll be sixteen."       Thanks!

When these people get the surgery/dentistry work it can sometimes cost thousands. What happens ten years down the line when the veneers are all worn down and need replacing? Does the person have to pay for the work or do the TV continue to pay for it? Especially when what teeth the lady just had were either pulled out of filed down to tiny stumps.  I mean if the person doesnt have the money to pay for expensive replacement veneers then what happens then?       Just curious/

20090205122115AA9M2vs	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What are some really good movies I could rent tonight?	In the psychological thriller, sci fi movie, drama or suspense categories? I don't want to watch any horror movies or anything bloody or gory. I have bad anxiety and I have enough crazy nightmares as it is. I've seen Fight Club a million times and love it, but want something I haven't seen yet. Movies I've watched recently are K Pax, Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Matrix, all the Star Wars movies and Lord of the Rings, Mission to Mars, every single Will Smith movie ever made, basically.. Girl Interrupted, Wall E, Sphere...and I've loved them all. I watch a lot of movies. Any suggestions? What are your favorites?

I watched a program on tv about a group of people that were at sea and they were on a blow up survival boat thing, and they had to fight to stay alive. I think there were 3 guys and a girl. They were out on the ocean for so long, 2 of the guys started having mirages (I think that's what it's called) and they drank salt water and it dehydrated them more, and they thought they saw a car on the water, so they jumped in and sharks ate them. In the end, only the guy and girl were left, and they were rescued by a boat and they got married. It was a true story kinda like a documentary I guess. I think it was on the discovery channel, or something like that. It was so interesting. Anybody have a clue what it is called? Thanks! :)

20070519212853AADFQTf	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of this movie?	This has been bugging me for a while.  I saw a movie when I was a kid and I can't seem to remember the name of it.  I can't really remember too much about it, but I will try my best to describe it.  A family of ghosts has been haunting an english castle for many many years.  A family of humans has just moved into this castle, among them a young boy (I'm guessing around 11-13 years old).  One of the ghost family, a young girl (around the same age) was given the responsibility of scaring off the intruders.  The girl is wearing aristocratic clothing of either the 16th or 17th century.  I remember a phrase she used in the movie that I liked cause the word jest sounded funny.  She said "shirely you jest!"  The two kids, human and ghost alike, teamed up to help both of their families.  I beleive they got rid of a curse that was keeping the family of ghosts there.  Also the kid was dressed in late 80s or 90s clothing.  If anyone could tell me the name of this movie, I would be very grateful!

Mexico City: As many as 210,000 people gathered on Mexico City's central Zocalo square for a free concert by Colombian pop star Shakira.    The square, which according to official estimates fits about 100,000 people, was full for the duration of the concert late Sunday.       Hundreds Shakira fans had camped in the areas near the Zocalo the previous night, while the square itself was kept closed, in an effort to get a good place.      The concert was one of the last in Shakira's current world tour Oral Fixation. The tour is set to end Wednesday in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey.      "This has been a month of absolute joy. I have fed off you, and I leave with my heart full," Shakira told the crowd.      The Colombian singer of Hips Don't Lie fame claims she has a long-standing "love story" with Mexico.

20070709105535AAwaCll	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Ice cream joke?	An elementary school math teacher asked her class one day, "If there are three birds on a wire, and a farmer shot one, how many are left?"   One little boy said two, but little Sally, realizing it was a trick question, said, "None, 'cause everyone knows that if you shoot at birds they all fly away." The teacher congratulates her on her correct answer.     Little Johnny, however, disagreed. He said, "No, there would be one -- the one that the farmer shot."     The teacher replied, "No, Johnny, you're wrong, but I like the way you think."     "OK, teacher, I have a riddle for you," boasted Johnny. "Let's say three women are at a bar and they each order a single scoop ice cream cone. The first one eats it by gently licking it around the edges, the second slowly sucks the ice cream off the cone from the top, and the third gobbles the top and then sucks the rest out of the cone. Which one is married?"     After a few seconds of contemplation, the teacher replied, "Well, I think it must be the third, the one that gobbles the top and sucks out the inside."     Johnny responded, "No, teacher, you're wrong -- it's the one with the wedding ring. But I like the way you think."

20070726222153AAGzoRW	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Estoy indignaaada..!?	Esque he leido muchas cosas encontra de Shakira...  y  me esta enfureciendo, primero dicen que canta mal, es gorda, es marketing..ya basta!  Yo se que no es la mejor cantante del mundo...pero es una gran artista, sus canciones son geniales...  Dicen que es gorda, oseaaa tener una linda figura con un gran trasero es ser gorda? madre mia...entonces cuantas obesas hay en el mundo?? Es pura envidia ya que algunas tienen caderas de hombres y traseros planos...  Y esto de que ya no es la misma de antes, es verdad yo tambien lo he notado, pero es porque no es un ser mediocre, como Juanes(sin ofender) adonde ah llegado el, quien lo conoce? no digo que cante fome, pero se quedo ahi.  Y bueno todos los humanos cometemos equivocaciones, y si shakira esta dejando de ser humilde como dicen algunos/as luego se dara cuenta, y aprendera...  Y lo otro que odio esque digan que ya sus canciones son malas, ni si quiera se toman la molestia de escuchar un disco. sus canciones sn = d buenas como las de antes. Ok?

My mom bought Celine Dion tickets last year for $1,200 total for her scheduled concert in October.  Celine then postponed the concert until today, 2/5.  My mom wrote it down and waited and waited.  So today rolls around and she calls to check and see if she needs to do anything special with her tickets only to find out the concert had been rescheduled AGAIN and was held in December.  She had never been told this (and they could have sent a letter as she bought the tickets via the mail so they knew how to reach her) and missed the concert.  And now they are saying that because she missed it it was her fault and they won't refund the money.        Anyone ever have any luck with Ticketmaster in a situation like this?

Just by the way he, looks I thought he might be gay just because he is 5'5 and has long hair and punk rocker look but that could just be because he likes bands.
