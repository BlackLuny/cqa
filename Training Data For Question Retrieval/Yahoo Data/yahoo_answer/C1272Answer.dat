That means, after an hour it will have travelled 300 km north.<br>  However, you then have the wind blowing at the plane 60km/hr west. This means that if your plane was staying still, it would be blown 60km west (err, yeah let's not take into account weight and stuff)<br>  <br>  If you put these together, after an hour your plane, instead of being 300km north of the starting point, would then be pushed somewhat diagonally Northwest. You can create a triangle to show this effect. With the base at top, and the hypotenuse on the left side, the base would be 60km long, and the height (length?) would be 300km. The hypotenuse is what your plane actually did, and if we divide it by an hour, that's the speed at which the plane was actually flying.<br>  <br>  sqrt(60^2+300+2)=about 306km/hr|`|Rv9isnQUaa	if you draw a triangle with the different forces...going north, the velocity of the plane is pushing 300, and west the wind is pushing the plane 60<br>  <br>  so using pythagorian's theorem...60^2+300^2=x^2<br>  <br>  and x =305.9 km/hr 18 degrees (300/60*90) WEST OF NORTH

Ftkr9jqYaa	Poliovirus initiates infection by binding to its cell receptor and undergoing a receptor-mediated conformational alteration.  In order to be infectious, the polio virus must have an amino acid sequence (i.e., a protein coat) that is soluble with the cell receptor, so that it can bind to the cell membrane and penetrate the cell.<br>  <br>  The poliovirus receptor (PVR) interacts with the polio virus, initiating conformational changes that lead to uncoating of the viral RNA.<br>  <br>  In polio-resistant cells, soluble receptors are able to bind poliovirus, neutralize viral infectivity, and induce structural changes in the virus particle.

cnPKAlDYaa	Theory of magnetism<br>  <br>  We have seen in the earlier section how a current carrying conductor produces a magnetic field.  An atom has negatively charged electrons orbiting around the positively charged nucleus. Each circulating electron can be visualized as a current loop. Thus electrons produce magnetic fields around themselves. In an atom, a pair of electrons in the same orbit, revolve in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. This cancels out the magnetic field produced by one electron with that produced by its pair. Only unpaired electrons are able to produce magnetic fields. Larger the number of unpaired of electrons, larger will be the magnetic field surrounding the atoms. As seen in case of solenoids, the magnetic field generated by an orbiting electron is along the axis of the orbit. This is generally shown by an arrow. <br>  <br>  In substances like copper, bismuth, the atomic magnetic field is non-existent because of paired electrons.  These are called non-magnetic substances. In substances like aluminum, platinum, there are unpaired electrons; they exhibit weak magnetic fields. At ordinary temperatures, the magnetic directions of atoms are random. Hence these materials show non-magnetic behaviour at ordinary temperatures. If an external magnetic field is applied, the atomic magnets get aligned with respect to the direction of the applied magnetic field. This behaviour is enhanced at low temperatures as the random motion of the atoms is reduced. Thus the substances which show magnetic behaviour on application of a magnetic field are called paramagnetic substances. When the field is removed, these substances show no magnetic properties. <br>  <br>  On the other hand substances like iron, nickel and cobalt show very high degree of alignment and magnetic behaviour with the application of external magnetic field. Even when the external magnetic field is removed, these substances continue and retain all magnetic properties. These substances are called ferromagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic properties may be lost at high temperatures, as random alignment of atoms is increased.

9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	1. The Greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon the earth uses to trap heat to warm the earth. A layer of certain types of gasses above the earth create a sort of blanket. As UV rays (sunlight) hits the earth, only a bit of it is absorbed by the earth, and then the rest of it bounces off. The Greenhouse gasses then absorb the reflected UV rays before it travels off into space, and then re-reflects this heat back to earth, giving it more heat.<br>  <br>  2.

Please, if you are really interested, and you sound like it, check out Major Paul Smith's website for training that doesn't fail. This isn't a commercial for him, but for the protocol that allows those of us, like you, to train and learn to be more on target and consistent.<br>  BTY Maj.

If you are sure that what you have experienced is real and that it exists, you are already closer to making this happen more than others who don't believe.  You must do as some have already said on here and practise a lot.  You have to stay open to possibility and to 'help from others'.<br>  Maybe try some deep breathing or meditation practises before bed or first thing in the morning.  Be vocal about not only allowing the visions to happen but embracing them and 'listening' to what they have to tell you.  By saying it out loud, you not only verbalize it to the other side (which is where you may get some help) but you reinforce to your subconscious that you are willing and able to handle what you see.<br>  In my experience, you are never given more than you can handle although it may seem like it at the time.

MMUGLjsPaa	As many people have already stated, Radio astronomy just isn't affected by the weather like visual astronomy is.<br>  <br>  One other point to consider though is the size of the receiving area that's required.  Just one dish can be quite large and weigh tons. So to lift it into space would be very costly.   Very large arrays (the current technology) of radio telescopes would just be to costly to maintain in space, whereas on they ground they're a lot cheaper.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	We normally don't because the Earth's atmosphere is relatively transparent to radio waves (no advantage in going to space) and radio-telescopes need to be very big in order to be efficient.<br>  <br>  However, we sometimes do.<br>  <br>  Three were sent to work in the microwave frequencies (where the atmosphere is a problem).<br>  <br>  One was sent by Japan a dozen years ago and one should be sent soon by Russia (RadioAstron) for the "normal" radio frequencies.  The reason is to provide a much longer baseline.<br>  <br>  In radio astronomy, if you take the signal from two separate antennas, and allow the signals to interfere with each other (interferometry), you can get the same resolution as if you had a single telescope, the size of the baseline.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have two receivers separated by 4000 km (2500 mi) looking at some object at the same time, the interference pattern may reveal details as if you were observing with a dish that is 4000 km in diameter.<br>  <br>  On Earth, the biggest baseline you can get, in practice, is about 8,000 km (5,000 mi).  You could go to 12,000 km, but the observation time is limited (as the object rises at one station, it sets at the other).<br>  <br>  But, if one telescope is in space, in an orbit that takes it beyond the Moon, you could get a baseline of 400,000 km (250,000 mi).<br>  <br>  That is what RadioAstron should do.<br>  <br>  If they ever launch it (they were already talking about it in the 1980s).|`|OGw6Upv8aa	wrong. there have been a couple, but it's far cheaper to do it from earth.<br>  <br>  this question seems familiar. perhaps you and your classmates should pool your resources and cheat together on your homework.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Radio telescopes must be very large in order to get adequate resolution at the wavelengths at which they operate. They are too large to be transported into orbit. Also, the Earth's atmosphere is much transparent and staedy at radio wavelengths than at visual wavelengths, so there's less need for them to be above the atmosphere.

But I think that it has something to do with the salt content in it. I know salt makes you retain water, and affects your kidneys because of too much salt in your body. And it may cause dehydration which can kill you.We need water to help flush out the body of the impurities, but it needs to be fresh water.|`|kykpxMXtaa	The idea is that you shouldn't drink ocean water -- or any salt water -- if you are trying to quench your thirst.  It is salt water, which will not decrease your thirst as pure water will.  If you are thirsty, your body needs to increase its concentration of water in relation to other things in your body, such as salt.  So, salt water is ineffective in doing this, and can actually make the ratio of water to salt in your body much worse.|`|2m1OOjTSaa	It's not advisable to drink ocean water not only because of the salt and what it does to your body, but also because of the bacteria in the water.  For example,  fishes and other sea creatures may have died in the water and are decaying.  This leaves the possiblility for some type of sickness when you drink it.  Also at a beach or public swimming facility, the chance of human urination is very high and could make the drinker very sick, if consumed.  I hope my answers helped you.

They are able to function and reproduce only if they can invade a living cell to use the cell's system to replicate themselves. In the process they may disrupt or alter the host cell's own DNA. They use the cell they invade to make more virus particles that are then released. This usually kills the cell.

E0j6mhqhaa	You can find stubborn and mean horses as well as mules.  It's more of an individual thing than for the species.  <br>  <br>  Mules are more heat tolerant and that's why they were more popular in the hot, humid southern states before tractors came along.  They're also more nimble footed and will step around things such as corn plants whereas horses stomp all over them.  They won't overeat and founder or kill themselves like horses will.  They're also more "gutsy" and tenacious when used for pulling.<br>  <br>  I'm sure the first mules were accidents but people saw real potential in them.  To get a mare to accept the jack, you usually have to tease the mare with a stallion to get her receptive and then at the last moment, slip the jack in there.  Talk about deceptive advertising!

cnPKAlDYaa	The ‘mid-Atlantic’ ridge is in the vicinity of the area of greatest stress and where rupture would most likely occur. As the separation of the South American landmass from the African landmass to form separate and distinct plates has taken place over geological time scales, it may be reasonable to assume that the original rate of separation took place far more rapidly than as shown at present. The propagation of the crack that is now the mid-Atlantic ridge would have occurred after separation had taken place.<br>  <br>  In a similar manner, the continuous movement of the position of the centre of mass with respect to the centre of rotation would have caused a corresponding change in direction of the rifts by the change in direction of the developed ‘vertical force’ component. It should thus be possible to correlate the changes of direction of the rifts with the movement of the centre of mass and in doing so also determine the change in inclination of the principle axis of rotation <br>  <br>  As the movement of the centre of mass from the centre of rotation is of the order of 0.5 to 1.0 Km, or 0.015% of the Earth’s radius, the actual magnitude of the movement is very small and totally feasible. The effects as shown by the analysis are however substantial <br>  <br>  Consideration of the calculation in Appendix 3 shows that the centrifugal force at the equator will cause a 0.34% reduction in the gravitational force experienced as compared to that experienced at poles where the rotational velocity is zero. This difference is considered sufficient to cause the plates to move around the Earth on a frictionless surface. However as the friction at the crust/mantle interface will impede this movement, it is not unreasonable to see this differential force (from the equator to the poles) make itself manifest as ‘transform faults’ which are in the direction of rotation and are at right angles to the direction of the mid – Atlantic ridge 8,9 et al.

He set up an interferometer so that the two legs were perpendicular.  If the interferometer was moving through the luminiferous ether, the speed should be different across the two legs, and he should have observed the interference fringes shift when the thing is rotated.  But there was no shift.  So they failed to find their speed through the ether, despite running the experiment at different times of day and different seasons.  So apparently the ether traveled with them wherever they went, which is kind of wierd.  Or else lengths and times contracted in wierd ways to compensate for the ether as Lorentz thought.

A tornado strikes suddenly, is very violent and last only minutes and it's all over.<br>  <br>  Same hold true for hurricanes also, but not as noticeable since hurricanes kind of come on slowly before it gets to full force. If the eye passes over you, it suddenly becomes eerily calm there too, but when the eye passes by, (typically 10 minutes give or take) the strong fierce winds suddenly blast back into action, especially if you're right on the coast and a cat. 4 ot 5 is on the way. (you might want to get out of the way) Usually the landward side of the hurricane is the stronger than the trailing side. If you're inland some, hurricanes lose their strength quickly over land.|`|GQ77ERMGaa	They tend to be, thats maybe because your in the eye of the storm|`|UFteXlqwaa	I am sorry but I can't agree with that without first defining what a storm is.<br>  <br>  If we are talking about large low pressure systems like hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones, the wind increases progressively as the isobar gradients increases. There is no "calm" in that sense.<br>  <br>  But if we look at a thunderstorm, that is a very local phenomenon, then we observe the following:<br>  <br>  A convection in unstable air mass is building. Air rises, lowering the pressure and a gentle breeze blowing toward the center appears. As the cumulonimbus increases in size, it spreads over a larger area.<br>  <br>  Note that when observing a thunderstom under building, you see then wind blowing toward it, making you think that the storm moves away, yet it moves toward you! That is because, on the surface, warm and moist air feeds the convection but aloft, it doesn't move at all, of if it does, very little.<br>  <br>  But what goes up must come down and it does in form of shear wind and micro-burst that then blow from the storm center. The wind then is strong enough to capsize sailboats and create havoc for a short while.<br>  <br>  But, before the wind turns 180 degrees, there is a short period of calm.<br>  <br>  That is the proverbial "calm before the storm."

Fmo4ZgYjaa	srklover456,<br>  <br>  I am not sure what equations your teacher wants you to use, so I'll just apply a little common sense.The wind is only blowing from the east, so it doesn;t effect the north-south direction.  The plane went 500 km south in 5 hours, that is 100 km per hour South.  <br>  <br>  Now, the plane went 1200 km west, but part of the distance was caused by the tailwind pushing the plane.  The wind is 75 km per hour, in 5 hours that would push you is 475 km.  So the plane would have only gone 725 km by itself (1200-475).  So the plane speed in the east west direction was 725 km divided by 5 hours equals 145 km/hr west.<br>  <br>  Now you have two components, you can use Trig to solve. for speed and direction.<br>  <br>  speed = sqrt((145 km/hr)^2 +(100 km/hr)^2)<br>  <br>  Lets call the angle from the true direction to the west direction theta.<br>  <br>  tan theta = (100 km/hr) / (145 km/hr)<br>  <br>  theta = arctan (100 km/hr) / (145 km/hr)<br>  <br>  theta = 34.6 degrees south of west.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps you<br>  <br>  Good Luck

When there is a high volume of water coming into a large stream from snow-melt and precipitation, the volume of water the stream is carrying increases, so the water level in the stream rises.<br>  The stream is naturally trying to either over-top the levee, or create crevasse splays in the levees so the water pressure in the channel will decrease, lowering the water level.<br>  <br>   The Army Corps of engineers has tried to control the Mississippi River since 1927. They aren't doing that great a job. The Bonnet Carre spill-way up-river from greater New Orleans was opened last April because the level of the river was getting pretty close to the top of the artificially heightened levees right next to the ACOE New Orleans office on Leake St. (I love the irony of that). The Bonnet Carre spill-way lets water from the Mississippi go into Lake Pontchartrain. The Morganza spill-way diverts water from the Mississippi to the Atchafalaya River as well, but I don't think the Corpse (oops! that keeps popping out of me) opened the Morganza spill-way last year. The Mississippi almost switched to draining through the Atchafalaya a few weeks before I was born in 1953. The Atchafalaya's gravity gradient is steeper and more efficient than the Mississippi's is.

9Xur3g9Paa	Tolerance to opiates develops very rapidly requiring ever increasing doses.  Methadone (a synthetic opiate) used to treat heroin addicts, but also a potent analgesic itself, much like morphine is a good example.  Patients in methadone treatment become so tolerant to the impairment initially produced by this drug that after a few weeks, they are usually safe to operate a vehicle (contrary to misinformed police, laypersons and others, this is very well documented in the literature).  <br>  <br>  Tolerance to tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) is much slower and could take months to develop.  Part of the problem of studying tolerance to THC with long term use is that you cannot do these studies in the lab or clinic (for ethical and legal reasons) and "field" data is subject to wide variations in the strength of the marijuana (i.e., the THC content).  Some anecdotal and older literature refers to a reverse tolerance to the intoxicating effects of smoking marijuana but most researchers believe this is partly due to gaining experience in recognizing and focusing on the unique high produced by THC.|`|lKXLaJ0Taa	Tolerance to opiates develops faster.  Actuall, it is believed that THC develops negative tolerance.  That is, the more THC you're exposed to the easier it is to have the psychotropic effects.  Tolerance develops because of down-regulation of the opioid receptors.  There is no such doen-regulation of THC receptors.  Actually, there is up-regulation of the receptors on presynaptic terminals.|`|vdT9VkZoaa	opiates. it clogs the brain connections quicker.

Again, being reinforced by tradition, young killer whales, when being taught to hunt, learn to hunt the same things as others in their pod.

That means, in your toenail, those toenail cells actually have the DNA to make your eyes and your brain. Now, if those genes were expressed, imagine how messed up we would be.<br>  <br>  Eukaryotic cells control gene expression so that a cell will be able to carry out only specific functions in a specific part of a body. This way, the eukaryotic cells are able to pack every bit of DNA into every cell, and then allow that cell to grow into whatever is called for or needed (expressed). You can probably look more into this for Stem Cells, and how they use these to create artificial hearts and lungs and stuff :)
CCeRdaoLaa	Novangelis is right, due to the hive structure, genetics is tough to test in ants.<br>  <br>  You can test genetics in insects, though.  You just have to look very closely.  Fruit flies are used all the time in genetics.  They're easy to grow, you can get a whole bunch of them (which makes the statistics better), and they have easily observable traits.  They might look like flying specks, but if you look closer under a magnifying glass, they have lots of different traits, like eye color, body segment number and size, wing size and shape, the way the wings fold, color, etc.<br>  <br>  Many times, though, Mendel's laws don't strictly apply.  Now that we have a better knowledge of genetics, we know that many traits are coded for by several genes, and that there's more to gene expression than just the actual sequence (it's a fairly new field called epigenetics).  In this way, many traits don't always follow Mendel's dominant/recessive model.|`|0xO8Y98uaa	The crazy thing about genetics is that while two creatures can look exactly the same, their genetics can vary drastically.  Not all genetic variation is going to be blatantly visible.<br>  <br>  Mendel's law talks about dominant versus recessive genes.  Without pulling apart the DNA of several ants, it's impossible to tell how well his laws took place.  If you look at two of his pea plants and they both have green pods, you can't know for sure that they aren't identical without opening them up and seeing whether the seed is green or yellow.|`|Mjl0X0SCaa	One of the greatest model systems used for to study is the fruit fly.  And yes, Mendel's laws apply.<br>  <br>  As for ants (and other insects like bees), they can reproduce parthenogenically, which means the offspring will be clones of the queen.  But the queen can mate (and does).  Eggs can be fertilized (producing females) or can hatch unfertilized (producing males).  <br>  <br>  In some species that reproduce via parthenogenesis, even when mating occurs, only the maternal chromosomes are expressed.  It's a difficult system to explain and if you want to know more I suggest googling parthenogenesis.|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	As ants descend from a single queen who produces the males to fertilize the eggs that become female, there is no cross-breeding to test individual traits.  Short of a complex labor-intensive process of taking drones from one colony to fertilize eggs from another, cross breeding cannot be tested.<br>  <br>  Drosophila (fruit flies) are a classic model for Mendelian genetics.|`|GioA9OFgaa	Everything applies.<br>  <br>  You must remember that ALL ants (or bees or wasps) are offspring of the same mother (the queen).  There can be multiple fathers, but that depends on the species.<br>  <br>  Genetics rules - there are no exceptions.  All ants, bees and wasps are sisters no matter the species, BUT the different generations depend on the young queen that leaves the nest to begin a new one, and which males happen to get to her.<br>  <br>  ALL lifeforms on the planet Earth are genetically influenced - there is nothing else besides genetics (that we know of, on this planet.)<br>  <br>  Mendel started the genetics investigation, but it has surpassed him by quite a bit.  Mendel just observed some pea flowers, but genetics is much more complicated than that.  Mendel's findings are historically important, but not definitive.

AA12026167	Dry etching refers to the removal of material, typically a masked pattern of semiconductor material, by exposing the material to a bombardment of ions (usually a plasma of reactive gases such as fluorocarbons, oxygen, chlorine, boron trichloride; sometimes with addition of nitrogen, argon, helium and other gases) that dislodge portions of the material from the exposed surface. Unlike with many (but not all, see isotropic etching) of the wet chemical etchants used in wet etching, the dry etching process typically etches directionally or anisotropically<br>  <br>       Dry etching is used in conjunction with photolithographic techniques to attack certain areas of a semiconductor surface in order to form recesses in material, such as contact holes (which are contacts to the underlying semiconductor substrate) or via holes (which are holes that are formed to provide an interconnect path between conductive layers in the layered semiconductor device) or to otherwise remove portions of semiconductor layers where predominantly vertical sides are desired. In conjunction with semiconductor manufacturing, micromachining and display production the removal of organic residues by oxygen plasmas is sometimes correctly described as a dry etch process. However, also the term plasma ashing may be used.|`|28b1dKT5aa	Dry Etching is an etching process that does not utilize any liquid chemicals or etchants to remove materials from the wafer, generating only volatile byproducts in the process. Dry etching may be accomplished by any of the following: 1) through chemical reactions that consume the material, using chemically reactive gases or plasma;  2) physical removal of the material, usually by momentum transfer; or 3) a combination of both physical removal and chemical reactions.

s5xOMGcbaa	Heres a trip report. <br>  <br>  Took shrooms at 6:30 pm nothing happens for the first hour. Around 7:45 I notice that things start to look a little different. Things were much brighter and lights had little halos around them. At 8 I noticed that my sense of time had changed remarkably. Minutes felt like hours but yet I didn't mind. People were playing games and having a great time but I didn't pay much attention to them. I slowly became separated from the rest of the people i was with. I was in the same room with the same people but yet the room looked totally different and I didn't recognize the people i was with (despite them being very good friends). I then lost all connection to these people. I couldn't see them and I didn't know where I was. I felt like I was floating through space. Everything was black except for distant lights which I perceived as stars. I started thinking about how the universe was created (big bang theory). I couldn't come to terms with what could have caused it. By this point I completely forgot that I had taken shrooms, I had forgotten who I was and who i was with. Thinking became extremely easy I could think of something and it would happen in my mind. It's now 10:30pm I have been awoken from my extremely vivid hallucinations by a friend who had apparently been trying to get me to talk to him. I was back in the room, everything had returned to normal except that everyone seemed to have a cartoonish appearance. They told me that I had been completely unresponsive for the past hour or so. We started to watch a movie. It was Labyrinth (one of the most trippy movies i have ever seen on shrooms or not). I couldn't seem to get how such a movie could exist. I kept asking what the hell is this? Who made this? omg did i just imagine that? After the movie I was starting to come down. It was around midnight when we decided to go outside and smoke and look around. The sky was purple and the whole world seemed to be condensed into one street. I went home and slept wonderfully and woke up the next morning completely amazed at the experience i had.

0mv2buHnaa	This observation was first made by the French chemist Joseph Proust based on several experiments conducted between 1798 and 1804.Based on such observations, Proust made statements like this one, in 1806:<br>  <br>  "I shall conclude by deducing from these experiments the principle I have established at the commencement of this memoir, viz. that iron like many other metals is subject to the law of nature which presides at every true combination, that is to say, that it unites with two constant proportions of oxygen. In this respect it does not differ from tin, mercury, and lead, and, in a word, almost every known combustible." <br>  The law of definite proportions might seem obvious to the modern chemist, inherent in the very definition of a chemical compound. At the end of the 18th century, however, when the concept of a chemical compound had not yet been fully developed, the law was novel. In fact, when first proposed, it was a controversial statement and was opposed by other chemists, most notably Proust's fellow Frenchman Claude Louis Berthollet, who argued that the elements could combine in any proportion.[3] The very existence of this debate underscores that at the time, the distinction between pure chemical compounds and mixtures had not yet been fully developed.<br>  <br>  The law of definite proportions contributed to, and was placed on a firm theoretical basis by, the atomic theory that John Dalton promoted beginning in 1803, which explained matter as consisting of discrete atoms, that there was one type of atom for each element, and that the compounds were made of combinations of different types of atoms in fixed proportions.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The answer is:<br>  <br>  E. excessive replicaton of proto-oncogenes<br>  <br>  Reason:<br>  <br>  A proto-oncogene is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon activation, a proto-oncogene (or its product) becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene.<br>  <br>  A tumor suppressor gene, or antioncogene is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes.<br>  <br>  An oncogene is a gene that, when mutated or expressed at high levels, helps turn a normal cell into a cancer cell.  Many cells normally undergo a programmed form of death (apoptosis). Activated oncogenes can cause those cells to survive and proliferate instead.  Most oncogenes require an additional step, such as mutations in another gene, or environmental factors, such as viral infection, to cause cancer.

sbutoRaZaa	Gravity will exert a downward force on the board, making the board want to slide down the wall. The static friction force will oppose the gravitational force, keeping the board in place on the wall.<br>  <br>  For the board to remain stationary (not sliding), the net vertical force on the board will be zero. So the friction force will be equal to the gravitational force:<br>  <br>  mg = static friction = (coefficient of static friction) * normal force <br>  <br>  The normal force on the board is the horizontal force you exert on the board (F in the problem statement).<br>  <br>  So you know m, g, and the coefficient. Note that the coefficient for static friction (unlike the coefficient for kinetic friction) takes a range of values from 0 to the maximum value (given in the problem statement to be 0.78) depending on the normal force acting on the object.<br>  <br>  So now you have mg = (coefficient) * F <= (less than or equal to) 0.78 * F.<br>  <br>  Solve for F:<br>    F >= (greater than or equal to) mg / 0.78 = (2.3 kg?)(9.8 m/s^2) / 0.78 = 28.9 N.<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure about this value because I don't know what the mass is supposed to be; what is "2.3-{\rm kg}"? Anyways, whatever range you find for F (where F>= some number), the minimum force needed to keep the board from sliding to the ground is "some number". In your case, if the mass is 2.3 kg, the minimum force will be 28.9 N.|`|ahgvhBHSaa	You know that the board has a mass of 2.3 kg. The acceleration would be 9.81 m/s^2.<br>  <br>  F=2.3 kg * 9.81 m/s^2=22.563 N<br>  22.563 N * 0.78 = 17.6 N<br>  <br>  So your answer is 17.6 N

2lQ8DJAcaa	Mercury’s core is one of the most interesting parts of Mercury. Here are some reasons why. Mercury’s core is made up of a large amount of iron. That is why Mercury is very dense and heavy compared with other planets. The core is surrounded by a layer of liquid material, and it is covered by a thin, rocky layer. It is still a mystery why Mercury has such a large iron core. One explanation is that Mercury crashed into another planet when it was very young and the two planets combined cores to create Mercury’s large core, but we could not know this for sure.|`|AA11039109	You know how far it is from the sun and how long it takes to go around, so you can calculate its mass from that.  You also know its diameter, so you can calculate its average density.  That density is way too high for Mercury to be mostly rock; it has to have a LOT of something much heavier.  The only heavy element that occurs in large quantity is iron.  So it has to have a large iron core.|`|b67b6b207d6484482b436e4a35975accaa	<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Surprising-Discovery-Planet-Mercury-Has-a-Liquid-Core-53886.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Surprisin...</a><br>  <br>  maybe that will help

Ftkr9jqYaa	The dikaryon is a nuclear feature which is unique to some fungi, in which after plasmogamy, the two compatible nuclei of two cells pair off and cohabit without karyogamy within the cells of the hyphae, synchronously dividing so that pairs are maintained in the older cells while newer cells or hyphal tips are also binucleate (i.e., dikaryotic); in the Ascomycota, this nuclear attribute is only found in the Ascogenous hyphae, but it is the dominant phase in the Basidiomycota. The formation of a dikaryon is a pleisiomorphic character for the subkingdom Dikarya, which covers both the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The formation of croziers in the Ascomycota, and of clamp connections in the Basidiomycota, facilitate maintenance of the dikaryons. However, some fungi in each of these phyla have evolved other methods for maintaining the dikaryons; therefore, neither croziers nor clamp connections are ubiquitous in either phylum.<br>  <br>  Many fungi have heterokaryotic life stages in which genetically different nuclei inhabit the same cell. In basidiomycetes, the heterokaryon is the product of mating and represents a genomic union very similar to a diploid thallus, yet the maintenance of unfused nuclei suggests a more complex association of the two genomes relative to diploidy. In species with variable numbers of nuclei per heterokaryotic cell, nuclear ratios within a mycelium may possibly become imbalanced (differ from 1:1) due to nuclear competition. Heterokaryons of the basidiomycete Heterobasidion parviporum display effects of genotype and environment on nuclear ratios within vegetative mycelia which are of both ecological and evolutionary significance. The data reveal that nuclear ratios are frequently imbalanced, generally stable over time, and genetically determined. The nuclear ratios are affected by environment, but the observed nuclear ratios do not follow the expectations of strong selection acting on a population of nuclei. Instead, these ratios are largely driven by genetic effects and epigenetic effects. Data also suggest that nuclear ratio imbalance affects both gene transcription and growth rate, implying that heterokaryotic basidiomycetes are not functionally equivalent to diploid individuals, and have a higher potential for genotypic and phenotypic variation.<br>  <br>  Dikaryons are important ecologically and evolutionarily with regard to many traits and environmental factors, such as:<br>  <br>  (1) Soil production,<br>  (2) ecological succession through the production of an improved environment for changes in the plant community, and<br>  (3) their hypersensitivity to air pollution.

BoUeBvYQaa	> "I just don't understand how we can see into distant galaxies, but not produce a photo of the landing sight"<br>  <br>  That's a good question.  The answer is: It's not so much a matter of how far away your telescope can see, but rather how much detail it can resolve.  There's a law of physics (google "Dawes Limit") that puts a limit on the resolving power of a telescope, based on the telescope's mirror diameter and the wavelength of light that it uses.<br>  <br>  You can do the calculation yourself, but it turns out that in order to resolve something the size of a lunar lander from a distance of 240,000 miles, you would need a mirror about 150 feet across.  There is no telescope on earth or in space that even approaches that size.|`|vxSXsn59aa	You assume incorrectly. In order to have the necessary resolving power to see any human artifacts on the moon from Earth, the telescope would have to be several hundred meters in diameter, and there just aren't any that big, anywhere. We can see distant galaxies because they are some tens of thousands of light years in diameter. The biggest thing we have put on the moon is less than ten meters in diameter. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that the six manned lunar landings actually took place. Why do you reject that evidence?|`|Ww4Va6sqaa	All the others are correct about not being able to see.

Photographers know the signs of artificial lighting, geologists could tell the rocks are from Earth, there would be telltale sign in the behavior of dist and objects travelling in a vacuum and low gravity, and spacecraft orbiting the Earth in Earth orbit cannot send a broadcast that could mimic one coming from a craft enroute to or parked on the Moon.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	We don't have telescopes powerful enough to see the objects left on the moon.

0OvZQFwjaa	The Band of Stability generally states that a nucleus will be stable if the proton and neutron counts are in a 1 : 1 ratio, a.k.a. they are equal for elements up to atomic number 20.  For elements between atomic number 20 and 83, roughly a 1.5 : 1 neutron to proton ratio is required.  Since your case has a 1:1 ratio, I would assume it is not a stable isotope.<br>  <br>  webelements shows that Gallium-62, the substance in question here, isn't a naturally occuring isotope at all.

Most atoms tend to have the same amount of neutrons in the nucleus as protons, give or take a few. Just check out your periodic table, and compare.<br>  <br>  Stability comes from the electrons of an atom, and how willing they are to take/give them away to fulfill the "Octet Rule" (most of the time).<br>  Another factor probably would be neutrons, for radioactive elements, however I think you'll need a huge difference between neutrons and protons.<br>  AHH! Here we go! Check out the source:<br>  Basically, if there are too many protons and neutrons, then the nucleus will break down easily, which is low stability. <br>  The element with 31 protons is Gallium, and I'm pretty sure that's not naturally radioactive.|`|pep1yy4eaa	Yes it would be stable because it is not an isotope, where the number of neutrons is different. When it is different, it may cause the atom to undergo radioactive decay. In this case, however, the atom has an equal number of protons and neutrons.

When President Nixon, a Republican, was elected in 1968 one of the first things he did was to cut funding to NASA.  That was even before the first Moon landing.

Under our present system, politicians must do what is popular, not necessarily what is right (in this case, conducive to the future progress of mankind). Despite its great longterm promise, space exploration/utilization is very expensive. Generally the masses don't want to make the necessary sacrifices to pay for a costly excursion to Mars. Instead of raising taxes or cutting benefits, to pay for space, they'd prefer that taxes be kept low and that tax money benefit them more directly, in the form of social programs. Of course, politicians in a democracy have no choce but to cater to such wishes, so space remains underfunded.<br>  The moon landing was largely motivated a patriotic desire to beat the USSR to the moon. After that succeeded in the 1969-72 period, public support fell and funding was greatly reduced. For reasons given above, it was never revived. Remarkably the US was able to fund several moon landings despite the huge cost of the Vietnam war, which peaked in 1969. After the end of the Cold war, from 1991-2003, the US had no comparable burdens, but space funding was still not revived. That, and the huge deficits, due to ever escalating social spending, atttests to the degree to which the national priorities are dictated by individual desires, to the detriment of great national or common causes, like a trip to Mars.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Lack of funding (NASA budget dropped from 5% of the federal budget to 0.58%), and finding some then unknown problems.

We've spent ten times that in Iraq and Afghanistan in only 6 years.<br>  <br>  Many would argue that this is the necessary cost of security in a violent world.  However my contention has always been that if we spent that money on space and scientific research, instead of new and interesting ways to exert power and influence, there wouldn't be the need for such much security.<br>  <br>  Just to set the record straight, we have been back to the Moon since the Apollo missions.  Remember Clementine?  We have spent billions sending probes and landers, but no more people.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  Because we are afraid of what those people might say.  Astronauts are culled from the military for one reason only.  Because they will obey orders and keep their mouths shut.  Just mention the term "National Security" with respect to any topic and any red blooded servicemember becomes dumbfounded and suffers from amnesia in regard to that topic.<br>  <br>  Neil Armstrong was considered one of the fittest astronauts both physically and mentally, and even he had things to say about his Moon missions that caused NASA execs and those in secret agencies to cringe.<br>  <br>  Our military personnel are taught to ignore those things they are not commaded to understand.  If it is not in the SOP, it does not exist.

The Moon does not belong to us.  Neither does our planet.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Na+/K+-ATPase (also known as the Na+/K+ pump, sodium-potassium pump, or simply NAKA, for short) is an enzyme (EC 3.6.3.9) located in the plasma membrane (specifically an electrogenic transmembrane ATPase). It is found in the human cell and is found in all metazoa (animals).<br>  <br>  Active transport is responsible for the well-established observation that cells contain relatively high concentrations of potassium ions but low concentrations of sodium ions. The mechanism responsible for this is the sodium-potassium pump, which moves these two ions in opposite directions across the plasma membrane.  The same carrier transports both Na+ and K+ ions. The carrier is an ATP-ase that pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in.<br>  <br>  The Na+/K+-ATPase helps to maintain resting potential by transporting ions, and regulates cellular volume.  It also functions as signal transducer / integrator to regulate the MAPK pathway and ROS, as well as intracellular calcium levels.

WzmwVlLnaa	Well if there are no forces acting on the rock besides gravity then the force of gravity acting on the rock will be equal to m*g*Sin(degrees tilted from horizontal). If there is also friction then the the force of friction will be equal to the normal force, which is perpendicular to the point where the rock contacts the surface, times the coefficient of friction and will be acting opposite of the motion of the rock.

This reaction is catalysed by an enzyme called rubisco. Notice that at the start there are three five carbon molecules (3 X 5 =15). After the carbon dioxides are incorporated into the cycle or fixed then you have 3 X 6 carbons = 18.  Each of the three 6 carbon products of step one is unstable and breaks down into two three carbon molecules called 3-PGA or 3-phosphoglyceric acid.  Energy from ATP provided by the light reaction is used to rearrange the threee carbon structure to form an intermediate molecule ready to receive electrons and hydrogens from the NADPH produced in the light reaction.  NADPH gives up its electrons and hydrogens to the three carbon intermediate compound. The result is 6 molecules of a three carbon molecule called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or G3P.  The remaining five G3P's (5 X 3 = 15 carbons) are rearranged and phoshorylated using 3ATP's to produce 3 new 5 carbon molecules of RuBP.

J7h0C66Baa	Yes the different honeys effect the bees.  Not all honey is the same nutritional value.  I read that almond honey is so lacking that bees starve to death on it alone. Secondly, it is contaminated with Arsenic, an insecticide naturally occurring from the pollen. We have a huge bee die off that they can't find the cure for.  Over 50% of all American bees are used in Almond pollination. There are as of yet no correlative studies being done on this seemingly blatant connection.  Of course, when you look at the areas that are doing the study, you notice that the Almond industry is supporting economically a lot of these inquiries either directly or indirectly. I suspect these studies are about as unbiased as those of the effects of tabacco on people were when the tabacco industrie was paying for those studies. While scout bees are searching for nectar bases to send the other workers to collect they can detect even small differences in sugar content between supplies. Bees fed almost any other type honey than Almond would be healthier and live longer than bees fed on Almond honey.  There are a couple of other plants like Cranberry and Cucumber that are also suspect along with Almonds. The movement of bees to these areas are not under study to see if they tie in with bee die off. Yes the different kinds of honey do have an effect on bees.|`|7qou0sdFaa	Honey is almost entirely made up of sugar and water.

JDK33laKaa	It is easier to draw this out. First draw a line from the center of the circle (X) to B. the angle between BC and XB is 90 degrees (definition of tangent). Thus angle ABX is 45 degrees (90 - angle ABC). Consider triangle ABX, AX = XB = radius i.e., isosceles triangle. Thus angle XAB = angle ABX = 45 degrees (angles opposite equal sides in an isosceles triangle are equal). Thus, Angle AXB = 180 - angle ABX - angle XAB = 180 - 45 - 45 = 90.

i0ypGmlQaa	The problem will involve one of the multiplicative axioms. The addition is defined in the normal way, so the multiplication must fail somehow.

What's the quantity that's important for multiplication? Either 1 or 0. Let's use both. Say a=1 and b=0.<br>  <br>  Then:<br>  <br>  (x,y) = (x,1y) = 1(x,y) = (1+0)(x,y) = 1(x,y) + 0(x,y)<br>  <br>  That looks fine, right?

Ftkr9jqYaa	The data obtained from DNA restriction analyses can be used for generating phylograms or cladograms. The data table can be used to plot a phylogenetic tree, indicating the relationship of those organisms that have been analyzed based on the restriction pattern obtained from their respective genes.<br>  <br>  DNA restriction analysis has been shown to be ideal, based upon cost–benefit analysis, for inexpensive genomic characterization of almost all isolated microorganisms.<br>  <br>  Restriction enzymes are proteins that cut DNA molecules at specific sequences of bases. These enzymes allow biotechnologists to reproducibly cut DNA molecules into well-defined fragments. Restriction enzymes are frequently used in biotechnology to analyze and make new DNA molecules.  Typically, the analysis of DNA using restriction enzymes involves a technique called agarose gel electrophoresis:<br>  <br>  ?Agarose consists of chains of sugars, and has a consistency similar to gelatin when used for this purpose.<br>  ?An electric current moves the DNA through the agarose, and the DNA molecules separate according to their size, with the smaller DNA molecules moving faster.<br>  ?The bands of different-sized DNAs are then detected by means of a dye added to the gel.<br>  <br>  DNA restriction analysis thus is useful not only in identifying and taxonomically classifying species, but is also useful for general studies of DNA sequences.

PSiNv7gUaa	At the last zoo I worked at, the wolves were supplemented with kibble, but it wasn't their staple diet.<br>  <br>  Let me guess, your vet is telling you to feed Science Diet?  Science Diet is crap, vets recommend it because SD sends them to vet school and gives them all kinds of perks (go to a SD convention sometime--they are surprisingly honest about it).  They make their dog food crappy so that your dog will have problems, then you will take them to the vet, who will give them prescription SD (which IS an acceptable food).<br>  <br>  Try feeding a grain-free food, or at least one that uses only meat meal as opposed to corn fillers.  Foods like Nutro, Canidae, NutriSource, etc. have much more meat in them.  They are expensive (but so is Science Diet), and you will spend less money because your dog won't need as much of it (as they can digest it much better without the corn).|`|SvmZlLdaaa	I used to be a zookeeper, and our wolves were fed on horse, cow or sheep joints, or occasionally whole chicken carcasses (all raw). I have never heard of a zoo feeding its wolves kibble, at least not in the UK, where I live - let's face it, that's not what they'd be eating in the wild. Wolves and dogs are not exclusive carnivores like cats - whilst the largest portion of their diet will be meat, they will also eat small amounts of fruit, berries, fungi and even flowers - but they can manage perfectly well without these. Dry foods can actually be harmful to dogs (and cats) if they are fed nothing else - the animal won't be getting all the moisture it would get from meat, and this can lead to kidney problems in later life (because of this, I'm surprised your vet is so keen for you to feed your dogs on kibble - does your mother buy it from him/her?). It's better to feed wet dog food, or at least some of each. Feeding your dogs raw meat would be good for them, especially with the occasional bone, and small pieces of vegetables if you like. Even the best manufactured dog foods contain additives like preservatives, salt and so on. Meat as it comes off a carcass is a much more natural diet.|`|mc59Y5vwaa	I have worked in zoos and the wild canines were fed a kibble, but that was laziness on the zoos part, not because they needed something other than meat.  Dogs CAN survive and actually thrive on a raw diet.  The best way to do it is actually to order whole rabbits or something similar, because the little bit of grain in the stomach provides them with added nutrients, but it is not necessary and many raw feeders will attest to that.|`|v0pF8m81aa	well you have to check everywhere for that|`|goaxOxzdaa	Wolves can't typically survive on kibble alone.  At the very least, they do not thrive on it and their health suffers when fed a diet only consisting of kibble.  They need actual meat in their diets, along with other substances they'll find in the gut contents or other parts like (bones and bone marrow, organs, etc) of the animals they kill or scavenge.  They also eat vegetables, fruit and roughage they find in their natural environments. <br>  <br>  This is why dog food (kibble) is formulated the way it is, but even so, feeding a dog a diet consisting solely of kibble isn't very good for the dog.  Kibble is most likely not what is causing your dogs to have "allergies", however.  The kibble they're getting is probably just lacking essential vitamins, minerals, and other substances the dogs need in their diets.<br>  <br>  They don't need RAW meat, it can be cooked if the idea suits your mom a little better.  Suggest that she mix in cut up boneless skinless chicken breasts with their kibble and see if things improve.  Mixing in raw broccoli, carrots, other vegetables or even some green lettuce isn't bad for them either.  With the carrots, use a peeler and after the carrot is peeled, continue to use the peeler so the carrot portions they're eating are small, thin strips rather than actual chunks of carrot.  They might not eat them otherwise - use this method for other vegetables they tend to reject when mixed with their food.  If you have access to venison (deer meat) from hunting or what ever, it is definitely a good choice of food for your dogs.  Also, try convincing your mom to pay a little more and feed the dogs a high quality dry kibble dog food if she currently isn't doing so.  If she's feeding them 'Ol Roy or some crap brand like that, your dogs actually could be allergic to it and they should really be eating better dog food.  I use Maximum, along with the other natural foods mentioned above (including venison) for my dogs, but there are even better brands than Maximum out there.  Just use Google to find out which one is rated best.<br>  <br>  But you can tell your mom that typically, wolves in captivity are fed raw meat and that to thrive, they need actual meat and will not fare too well if they are fed only dry kibble dog food.

The only way to improve the velocity of a coil gun is (1) more power and (2) proper sequencing of the coils for continuous acceleration.     I'm not sure how you are sequencing the coils, but you should be turning each coil off as the projectile enters, and turning on the next coil.   If the acceleration is continuous (ideal), then the velocity is increasing as t^2, which means the coils get further and further apart.
s9zefBbvaa	In order to write an equation for a nuclear reaction, we must first establish some basic rules. Each of the elements involved in the reaction is identified by the chemical symbol. Two numbers are attached to the symbol. The number at the upper right is the mass number, also known as the ‘A’ number. The 'A' number describes the atomic weight of the atom and identifies the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The number at the lower left is the atomic number, or ‘Z’ number. The 'Z' number describes the number of protons in the nucleus and determines the type of atom. <br>  <br>  The symbol for Uranium-238 = U ^238/92<br>  This shows you that Uranium has a mass number of 238 and an atomic number of 92. <br>  <br>  Symbols are also utilized to represent alpha and beta particles. <br>  <br>  The symbol for an alpha particle = He ^4/2<br>  The symbol for a beta particle is  = e ^0/-1<br>  The chemical symbol for a neutron = n ^1/0<br>  <br>  Now that we know what these symbols represent, let's see how they can be applied to a nuclear equation. Uranium-238 is an isotope, which undergoes alpha decay to produce Thorium and gamma rays. This is expressed mathematically by the following equation:<br>  <br>  U ^238/92 --> Th ^234/90 + He ^4/2 + gamma rays<br>  <br>  Note that when the mass numbers on each side of the equation are added together that they are equal. The same principle is true for the atomic numbers, and it shows that none of the atomic particles have been lost. One way to check to see if you have written the proper nuclear equation is to make sure both sides of the equation have the same number or atomic particles represented.|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	Nice background!|`|AhEy353naa	Ok, it's<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK!!!!|`|szwFTvNaaa	Sorry I can't help you but I hope you get your answer.|`|8oovDGZgaa	this isnt physics?

The fastest would be to obtain a topographic map for your area. The USGS creates and provides these for various purposes, but in your case, just find your location on the map, and look at the local contours. The contour lines on a map are relative to sea level. In Denver, the magnitude would be high due to greater elevation, in New Orleans it would be near /  below zero. Some high-tech surveying equipment is capable of providing some good information as well. Hope this answers your question. If you're just talking about being high on drugs, you should stop wasting your life and probably find a new hobby.

ILzRIa10aa	Not sure exactly what you mean.  The penis and testes come from the same embryonic tissue as the vagina and the ovaries.  The difference is testosterone.  The formation of the testicles is from testosterone.  The formation of the penis is from DHT (dihydrotestosterone).  This all happens in the uterus before birth.  After birth, the continued growth of the testicles and penis are driven by testosterone and DHT.  There is little change until puberty.  At this point, the hormone levels begin to rise.  This surge of hormones leads to the rapid growth and pubic hair that develop. <br>  <br>  So, if you have no testosterone as an embryo, then you have male genes, but your parts will look female because no hormones were around to tell them to be a penis and testicles.  If you don't have testosterone later, then you will continue with a pre-pubescent penis and testicles.<br>  <br>  There are some very complex variations of how this can go wrong.  You can read more about syndromes such as androgen insensitivity syndrome or penis at 12 syndrome (there are many others).|`|vAhpjdNJaa	it's from the genes on your Y chromosome, which does include testosterone. <br>  obviously penises grow naturally. i don't really understand your question honestly...<br>  a naturally growing penis WOULD be from increased testosterone levels. at least, that's one of the factors.|`|Rd3Mj3O9aa	.................
goaxOxzdaa	No.  Lions and other felines are obligate carnivores. They may consume other products presented to them, especially animal products like eggs and bone marrow or sweet sugary substances like honey and syrup, but, as these items are not essential, they do not consume them on a regular basis.  They need actual meat because there is an amino acid called Taurine that, in substantial amounts, is found only in the flesh of other animals.   Taurine is essential to their survival as they cannot synthesis it like other omnivorous animals can.  Also, true carnivores have a comparatively short and straight digestive system which renders them unable to break down the tough cellulose found in plants.|`|hD25pT1Laa	I believe all cats require the amino acid taurine in their diets.

KBsHMSOmaa	Well, plants close their stomata to reduce water loss. <br>  Plants need to take in CO2 from the atmosphere in order to photosynthesize. How does the CO2 get into the leaf? Leaves have pores called stomata on the epidermal layer of the leaf. Stomata are the openings through which plants respire. The stomata are flanked by two guard cells, which control the size of stomatal openings. Guard cells thus regulate the flow of gas and water between the leaf and its environment. Plants typically close their stomata at night to avoid too much water loss.

There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.|`|W2suykEtaa	why do you ask?<br>  <br>  i mean, really?<br>  <br>  everything predicted by these guys has been shown to be bald-faced lies time and again, yet you keep asking "is it real?"<br>  <br>  what is your motivation?<br>  <br>  are you working for Sonypictures promoting the movie "2012"?<br>  <br>  are you selling a book?<br>  <br>  is your best friend selling a book?<br>  <br>  come on... you are only scaring children and those whose minds function on that level... does that make you feel good?|`|UQ4XXu5Yaa	I believe theres a chance.

These people intentionally try to persuade people otherwise for some sort of attention, fame or profit. <br>  <br>  However, there's one significant fact that the 2012 doomsayers all seem to forget: Despite all the various 2012-ish predictions for the end of the world, there are far more stories of apocalypse with different dates. For example, popular interpretations of Nostradamus found predictions for the end of the world in July of 1999, December of 1999, June of 2002, and October of 2005. It's also been said that his writings could mean the dead will rise from their graves in either 2000, 2007, or the year 7000. Nostradamus never said anything about 2012. <br>  <br>  A number of Bible scholars found firm scriptural evidence that the Rapture would happen in October of 2005. Thousands of Koreans gave away all their money and possessions in preparation for the Rapture on October 28, 1992. Even Sir Isaac Newton made a calculation based on scripture that showed the Rapture could not happen before 2060. Some Jewish scholars place the "end of days" via Armageddon in the year 2240. I couldn't find 2012 mentioned in any of these stories.<br>  <br>  In fact, James Randi's magnum opus publication An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural lists 44 distinct end of the world predictions that all came and went unfulfilled.|`|cHILDdrIaa	Aww hunn :) lol, i honestly don't believe it will end in 2012, if it does its not for that reason, god says NO MAN knows the day,only god, people think god is never coming back,but i believe he is not slow to his promises ,but he is patient, he doesn't want anyone to suffer, just be ready, because he can come back any day!|`|CoRGsuN3aa	I'm scared too.

UFteXlqwaa	During the summer, the north pole is under a six months day; the sun never sets. But the winter is a six months night; the sun never rises.<br>  <br>  Because of that, the temperature in the summer is much warmer than in the winter. And that's your clue; the weather is not so much about temperature but about difference of temperature!<br>  <br>  Because while both poles swing very much in temperature according to the season, the equator's temperature remains pretty much the same at all time.<br>  <br>  The cold and heavy air from the pole meets the warmer tropical air along a front roughly at latitude 60 north. There, the warmer air from the south climbs over the the colder air from the north and that ascension crates a lower air pressure; hence the birth of all the frontal lows that influence our weather.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, during the winter, the high pressure over the pole extends further south because there is much more cold air there. It may brings the bad weather closer to your latitude.<br>  <br>  We often associate thunderstorms with the summer and that is true; usually a long period of intensive summer heat ends up with thunderstorms. But thunderstorms can happen any time as a cold front passes, replacing the moist warm air with the cold polar one.<br>  <br>  During the summer, we see isolated thunderstorms, especially if living at the foot of a range of mountains (orographic effect) and during the winter, we see thunderstorms following squall lines typical of an advancing cold front.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	it doesn't....it's almost spring that's why it happens

You want an expression in the form of x^2 + bx + c that is a perfect square.  That is, you want to be able to pick some number n such that:<br>    x^2 + bx + c = (x + n)^2<br>  <br>  From here let's look at the right hand side in detail:<br>    x^2 + bx + c = (x + n)(x + n)<br>    x^2 + bx + c = x^2 + 2nx + n^2  (make sure you agree before you go on!)<br>  <br>  Now focus on the differences:  the variable b in your original expression is the same as the 2n in the new expression.  Further, the constant that you are missing, the c, is the same as the n^2 in the new expression.  Like this:<br>    b = 2n<br>    c = n^2<br>  <br>  Stick with me; this next part might be hard to follow written out in this format!<br>  <br>  You know b, so you know what 2n is.  (Remember that b comes from the x-term in your original expression.)<br>  When you know what 2n is, you know what n is.  (Half of it!)<br>  Now that you know what n is, you know what n^2 is.  And that's the same as c, your missing value!<br>  <br>  To summarize it, start with your b value, the coefficient of the x-term.  Take half of it, and then square it.  That'll complete your square.<br>  <br>  Not too hard, is it?  You'll have to work them out yourself, though.

That's what makes O2 so attracted to hemoglobin and will bind as substrate.. In the lungs, the attraction rate is very high because there's such a high number of O2 present. Once it reaches the tissue, the pressure of the environment causes hemoglobin to release the O2 molecule and allows it to react with the tissue. CO2 binds to the hemoglobin when that happens because the CO2 count is high in tissue since it's excreted from the tissue after use. Hemoglobin then carries it back to the lungs, and the opposite process will repeat.|`|gfmTgLDKaa	Max S above me is definately right! :D Click this link or his link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diffusionpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/animation1.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.diffusionpharma.com/wp-conten...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy, and good luck! :D

The kidney has a system to reabsorb most things back into the blood (the Nephron) so that by the time this waste has gone through the kidney, it actually is all waste. Proteins and such usually get reabsorbed in the Proximal and Distal Convuluted tubules.<br>  <br>  If proteins were present in the urine, that means your kidney is somewhat damaged and not reabsorbing the proteins back into your blood.<br>  (Same would be for diabetics, who cannot absorb sugar (glucose) and so will not be able to reabsorb it back from the waste in idney and end up in urine ;))

wXaGIPSPaa	The reason evergreens stay green all year is not simple. Evergreen trees (trees that keep their leaves year-round instead of losing them all at once) originated in cold, northern climates. In the north, the growing season (spring/summer) is very short compared to that of the south. Trees use light to make food through photosynthesis. In order to survive in the shorter growing seasons, trees needed to gather light all year long. The only way to do this was to gather light for photosynthesis in the winter. (However, trees can only photosynthesize when water is available in a useful form, so when the only available water is snow or ice, even evergreen trees are dormant. They rest until conditions are right for photosynthesis to start again.) <br>  <br>  Evergreen needles are an adaptation (a change that allows something to survive). Botanists long ago discovered that needles are actually regular leaves that are rolled up very tightly. This shape is an adaptation that allows evergreens to conserve water (also necessary for photosynthesis). Evergreen needles also have a very waxy coating that also helps save water during summer and winter. <br>  <br>  Try this experiment: put two cups of water on a table in the sun, leave one cup open to the air, but cover the other with plastic wrap. The sun's energy begins to evaporate the water. From which cup does the water evaporate faster? The answer to this experiment will help you to understand how the waxy covering on evergreen needles helps conserve water. <br>  <br>  There is your answer...evergreen trees are regular trees whose leaves are rolled up and covered with wax! This way they can make food for themselves all year long (as long as water is available in a useful form), without drying out.

ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	No.  Ageing depends on environmental factors, nutrition,  inheritance and the ends of parts of the genetic material everybody has called telomeres.  These don't actually do anything much apart from protecting the ends of the DNA.  When a cell divides, a little of these is clipped off.  Eventually all of it is clipped off and the cell cannot divide any more without clipping off the parts of the genetic material that do a real job.  Since the next copy is seriously imperfect, and the one after that is even worse, the organism eventually dies.<br>  <br>  Bacteria don't have telomeres, their DNA is in a circle and nothing gets clipped off.  Therefore they are effectively immortal unless killed of course. A bit like the elves in "The Lord of the Rings".|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Age is not directly related to the number of days it takes to orbit our sun.

We could count the number of days we've been alive, but then we get into some huge numbers (and its real easy to lose count).<br>  <br>  A twin on another planet would look the same (age the same) as their twin on Earth, with a few things to think about.<br>  Aging is an ongoing change in our bodies and minds from stresses, toxins in our environment, disease, gravity, work, and other factors.<br>  So one twin could be living in a more stressful or toxic environment and could "age" faster.|`|AA10873379	Yes, the twin on the "other planet" has still lived 20 earth years even if the planet the twin was on took 100 earth years to go around to the earth one year go around.<br>  <br>  Local example. A person born on Feb 29th. Only has a birthday every 4 years, so in sixteen years he is only four years old? No he is 16 years old but has only celebrated his birthday 4 times.

In this problem, you have 4 terms:<br>  wy<br>  -2w<br>  2y<br>  -4<br>  <br>  In 4 variable statements, you're going to "group". Grouping is where you put parentheses around blocks of 2 statements. The goal is that each statement will be able to have a GCF (greatest common factor) pulled out of it, that leaves 2 of the same statements in the parentheses. Here's how you would do that:<br>  <br>  wy-2w+2y-4<br>  <br>  Right off the bat, you notice that the terms wy and -2w both have a w, and 2y and -4 both have a 2. So we're going to put the parentheses around these two blocks:<br>  <br>  (wy-2w) + (2y-4)<br>  <br>  Pull out the GCF:<br>  w(y-2) + 2(y-2)<br>  <br>  Now that the GCF is pulled out, in these type of factoring problems you finish it off by combining the GCFs with what is in the parentheses, like so:<br>  <br>  (w+2)(y-2)<br>  <br>  And you're done!<br>  <br>  Other types of factoring:<br>  <br>  1) x^2 + 6x + 9<br>  To do this example, you want to break apart the multiples of the last term (9). In other words, you will find every whole number that multiplies together to equal that last term. The multiples of 9 are:<br>  <br>  1 * 9 and 3 * 3<br>  <br>  The goal of doing this is to find which pair of numbers, when added together, will equal the coefficient (or the number before the variable) of the second/middle variable in the statement. <br>  <br>  In this case, the second variable is 6x, so thus, the number we're looking at is 6. 3 + 3 is equal to 6, so that is the pair you will use. And remember, the multiples can be mixed in their positive or negative form to equal the coefficient. This will be seen in the next example.<br>  <br>  To factor it from here, you will have this basic setup:<br>  <br>  (x +/- _)(x +/- _)<br>  <br>  Since all of the numbers in x^2+6x+9 are positive, there will be no - sign in the factored version. In the blanks you will plug in the two multiples:<br>  <br>  (x+3)(x+3)<br>  <br>  Now remember, in this particular example, it can be reduced to (x+3) squared.<br>  <br>  2) x^2 - 6x +7<br>  Multiples of 7: 1 * 7<br>  To get -6, you will need to have -7 + 1<br>  The final result will be:<br>  <br>  (x - 7)(x + 1)<br>  <br>  <br>  3) 5x^4 - 5x^2<br>  This example reads 5 times x to the 4th minus 5 times x squared. In a problem such as this, there is no other way to factor it besides pulling out a GCF, or at least to begin with. Both 5 and 5 are divisible by 5 (obviously), and both of the x terms are divisible by an x squared. Therefore, your GCF will be 5x^2:<br>  <br>  5x^2(x^2 - 1)<br>  <br>  Now, math is all about simplest form. There's a third type of factoring in whats above, called the "difference of squares". This is when you have a value with a square root minus another value with a square root in parentheses. (x^2 - 1) is tricky because you don't normally think of 1 having a square root right off the bat. But 1 * 1 is in fact 1, so this can be reduced even more.<br>  <br>  In the difference of squares, you do the square root of the first number plus the square root of the second number times the square root of the first number MINUS the square root of the second number, like so:<br>  <br>  (x + 1)(x - 1)<br>  <br>  Now, following along with the other problem, you can't forget to include your GCF on the outside. The final answer to this problem would be:<br>  <br>  5x^2(x + 1)(x - 1)<br>  <br>  And that's all you can do.<br>  __________<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of for now, good luck.|`|ie0jVY23aa	wy-2w+2y-4<br>  <br>  Think of it in two pieces.

4RJKl1aKaa	If the oil price volatility of the last few years has shown us anything it is what is likely to happen as oil supplies diminish.  The world isn't going to carry on as normal until one day the oil dries up and there is no more - supplies will diminish - we may already be past peak oil - and prices will increase.  Oil will become unattractive as an energy source long before it becomes too expensive as a raw material.<br>  <br>  In any case, no oil would not affect glassmaking where the principle raw material is sand.  Similarly there are other sources from which we can derive most petrochemicals, plastics included - coal tar for instance.

Thus the earth is a tad wider (25 miles / 41 km) than it is tall, giving it a slight bulge at the equator. This shape is known as an ellipsoid or more properly, geoid (earth-like).|`|bIvZknnbaa	The distance of the "bulge" you speak of is skeptical.  I doubt any non-noticeable distance will actually change the force of gravity to a degree where weigh would have an impact.|`|nQyOFR5Paa	nothing noticeable|`|FT4mVJMzaa	You are correct, and there is also the centrifugal force to be accounted for. Your weight at the equator is about 1% less than your weight at the poles.|`|AA10222010	According to your note about Earth's bulge, if the equator is indeed farther from the Earth's center then gravitational acceleration there would indeed be slightly less.<br>  <br>  How much less that gravity is I don't know. The equation to figure out gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface is -- g = G*m/r2 where 'r' would be the distance to Earth's center.

E0U2yII3aa	Yeah, it's creepy. To think that the iron in your blood and the one inside the planet may have formed in the core of a massive star reaching more than a hundred million degrees Kelvin and now resting at a temperature around 37 degrees Celsius inside you and about 7000K inside the planet, respectively, is weird enough. Heavier elements are formed in the core of stars. The heavier the element (compared to hydrogen and helium) the more massive the star and the higher temperature it must have been formed. And to think that everything here on earth may have formed in the core of not just a single star will fascinate you more. The dusts (silicates) you see and even walk on may have been formed when a red giant or a red supergiant eroded its outer envelope in very powerful winds. Don't forget that the water in your body came from a giant molecular cloud (that produced the comets in the early solar system) that could have formed the sun and other stars. So, essentially you are made out of "star material".|`|pfaddytkaa	yupp!!! We are carbon based organisms...just like stars are made up of mostly carbon|`|RGC2aDf2aa	no honey it not true... we not made from stars, God create many things like human... human can't be animal and animal cannot be plant and even they can't understand their level. plant cannot find out there are animals in this world and animals cannot find out there are humans in this world, cause they have different level and different ability..<br>  so HUMAN cannot been STARS... its not true at all... (*_*)|`|VPhYOWxwaa	In the beginning there were only the lightest elements in existence (hydrogen and helium) and the universe was full of it. Eventually minor fluctuations caused the gas to clump together, compress under its own gravity and eventually fuse together to create heavier elements in the core of the stars. Then a lot of those stars eventually exploded in supernovae and spewed those heavier elements across the universe. This happened and happens many many times and that is the origin of all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. And we are made of some heavier elements including oxygen, so we are all made from stars.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Actually, I think it makes each of us part of something bigger than just our own tiny little world.<br>  No matter our differences in religion or economy or language, we all came from the same beautiful origins.|`|MqoOPi9Xaa	what i find weirder is that my great...(million greats) grandfather could be the same as the chimp down the street in the zoo|`|56p9e0LDaa	Well to state that stars are planets of light would be wrong. A star is a giant or not so giant(the Sun) ball of plasma that is held together by its own gravity. A star is constantly undergoing fusion and fission as elements are formed and altered in a vicious combustion cycle that drives the star. Saying that a star is light is false, a star gives off light as energy, but it also gives off energy in many other forms. Also, to say that we did come from stars is highly unlikely. As a strong believer of evolution, I believe that all life that we know of, was created and evolved on Earth after it's creation. In scientific studies, it shows that inside magma, was found amino acids (Yes, amino acids were also found in space dust, but that changes the theory because maybe the space dust landed on Earth not just always here.!?) Anyways, the amino acid has already been found out to be the sole creator of life as when amino acids form together it forms proteins enough to make cells. Thus, creating single celled organisms. Since, the oceans were a lot calmer than the land at this time, it's most suggested that single celled organisms lived in the oceans and slowly evolved into more complex creatures. On land however, a more stronger and heartier creation was forming and plants started growing. Over billions of years, animals and plants evolved. Over time animals finally reached land where they started evolving here as well. Then came apes after another millions of years of evo. Then eventually Apes started getting smarter then evolved into ancient world humans. Then, first civilization started and corrupted to todays.|`|2DDqXdf6aa	Athiests belive that, they belive we were all made by some kind of star or matter that kept expanding and eventually made life but there is also religion and that indicates that a power greater than us made humans which is god but it depends on your beleifs, we will really never know.<br>  <br>  :]|`|WCICeezjaa	Yes, it is, because the same elements created at the big bang theory went on to create the stars and also created human life.|`|xLkiqIKAaa	Yea it is actually true

PGOepobcaa	In both the processes of DNA synthesis and mRNA synthesis, a parent DNA strand is the template for synthesis. In both processes, an enzyme complex comes in and binds to a specific position on the template DNA strand(s), and then the enzyme generally moves in the 3'-5' direction along the template strand of DNA during the synthesis. <br>  <br>  in DNA synthesis, there are a great number of enzymes that are involved (topoisomerases, helicases, etc etc etc). The main enzyme involved in synthesis- DNA Polymerase- binds to a region on the DNA known as the origin of replication. 2 enzyme complexes will bind at the same time, and one of these complexes will synthesize on each strand of DNA (after the DNA has been separated). Leading strand synthesis is uninturrupted, while lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous and makes use of okazaki fragments. DNA replication is semi-conservative, meaning that the newly-generated molecule of DNA will contain one new strand, and one strand from the original parent molecule. <br>  <br>  In mRNA synthesis (transcription), the enzyme RNA polymerase will bind to a very specific site on the DNA known as the promoter. It will transcribe a strand of RNA in the 3'-5' direction until transcription is terminated by either a rho-dependent or a rho-independent mechanism. Exons are spliced out of the RNA strand by enzymes called splicizomes, the strand of RNA is given a cap and a poly-A tail, and this mature form of RNA is known as mRNA.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Replication is to make a copy of a DNA & mRNA is the form of RNA that carries information from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome sites of protein synthesis in the cell.

This accretion disk is quite hot and goes above the equator of the hole (black holes are always spinning, and fast too due to conservation of angular momentum).<br>  <br>  There are also two long thin jets shooting out from both poles of the hole. They look a bit like laser beams usually do in science fiction movies but it's not a laser. It's finely pureed matter that's being ejected from just above the poles at very close to the speed of light. It's believed that these jets are a product of the contorted magnetic fields near the poles. Relativistic jets can remain visible for thousands of light years unless dust gets in the way.<br>  <br>  Note that while both small black holes that may only be munching on one star and behemoths at galactic nuclei that rip dozens apart at once are governed by the same physics, only the large ones are called quasars. See this article.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/quasars.html#q1" rel="nofollow">http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/quasars....</a>|`|E0U2yII3aa	Say a supermassive black hole resides in the center of every galaxy. When you feed it with material, it becomes active and glows in several wavelengths  across the entire bandwidth. Now you call it active galactic nucleus or AGN. When it glows most specifically in the visual spectrum that it will appear star-like (hence the name ,quasi-like) to us, it can now be called a "quasar".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassiv...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_gala...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar</a>|`|WCICeezjaa	In brief, the quasar is the glowing gas around the black hole. It is so bright that the black hole itself is invisible. The quasar is the fuel supply to the black hole and when the quasar cannot be seen the black hole is dormant. That is typically seen as common knowledge by my intellectually inferior colleagues at MIT.|`|3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi. We think that a quasar is a young (old but seen from a vast distance) black hole that is absorbing vast amounts of matter.|`|2tdokuWvaa	A quasar is an extremely powerful and distant active galactic nucleus.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	A quasi-stellar radio object.  It is a powerful and distant source of radio noise, generally thought to be caused by matter falling into a black hole in a galactic centre, but not necessarily always that.  You might get a similar effect from a neutron star, a less massive black hole centre or a white dwarf.  By measuring the spectrum  and red shift of the radio noise you can get some idea of what it might be. <br>  <br>  Even Saturn is a source of radio noise, but it isn't a quasar.|`|AA11564934	did u try wikipedia?

o04hl9ZFaa	Osmotic pressure is the pressure of water trying to get into a cell or, more generally, through a membrane. If, say, a cell has lots of solute (such as protein, salt, or ions), water will want to get into the cell and dilute that solute until it becomes equal to the external environment. This "drive" for water to flow and create equilibrium is called osmotic pressure.
zFsTSrOcaa	One theory is that the breakup of a supercontinent (Rodinia) led to greatly increased rock weathering.  The interior of a supercontinent is extreme desert, thousands of miles from any ocean; and when the supercontinent breaks up, there is less desert and more rainy coastal climate.  Weathering of rock is the main process by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere, and the increased weathering led to decreased CO2 levels.  This, combined with a solar output roughly 5 percent lower than today's value, triggered a runaway ice age.<br>  <br>  Once the earth froze over, rock weathering stopped almost completely.  Volcanoes continued to erupt, though, releasing CO2 over millions of years, increasing the greenhouse effect and eventually melting the ice.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	The planet goes through cycles of climate change, once it gets hot enough and dumps enough fresh water in the oceans to stop the global currents it will begin another ice age|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Ice ages are thought to form for a number of reasons.  But ice ages do not cover the entire Earth in ice.<br>  A "snowball Earth" where the entire Earth was covered in ice is still debated as to whether it occured.<br>  But a number of mechanisms are thought to have possibly contributed, including:<br>  - a younger sun would have been less warm than today<br>  - polar continents around BOTH poles (unlike today, where only one pole has a continent)<br>  - less CO2 and methane in the atmosphere (perhaps due to a significant die-off of plants) which would have cooled the Earth<br>  - significant volcanic activity which would have cooled the Earth

oKRbe6XYaa	Female ejaculation (colloquially known as squirting or gushing) refers to the expulsion of noticeable amounts of clear fluid by human females from the paraurethral ducts through and around the urethra during or before orgasm. The exact source and nature of the fluid continues to be the topic of debate among medical professionals<br>  <br>  Much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions[66] and to research methodology. Research on this subject has used highly selected individuals, case studies, or very small numbers of subjects, making generalisation difficult, hence the continuing controversies and debates. For instance, much of the research into the nature of the fluid concentrates on trying to determine whether it is urine or not. Problems relate to the difficulties involved in the collection of specimens and of contamination. Since the area of interest is para-urethral glands, it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine, especially where there may be retrograde ejaculation back up the urethra towards the bladder. The best data comes from studies where women have abstained from coitus, and where their own urine is used as controls, pre and post orgasm. One way of sorting this out is the use of chemicals that are excreted in the urine, so that any urinary contamination can be detected. Another methodological issue arises from the fact that the composition of the fluid appears to vary with the menstrual cycle,[67] while the biochemical profile of the para-urethral tissues also varies with age.[68] Other issues relate to the sensitivity and specificity of the markers chosen. The key questions are the source of the fluid produced, and its nature.[43] Some findings have been presented in conferences but never published in peer review journals, and many others are in difficult to access resources.

GASTNilgaa	You did indeed make some algebra mistake--- 2*2^(2x) - 2*2^x + 2 = 0 has no real solutions, but the equation as written does have one solution.  Writing u for 2^x, the original equation is<br>  <br>  1/(u-1)^2 + 3/(2u+2) = 3(2u - 2)<br>  <br>  multiplying through by (u-1)^2 (2u+2) to clear denominators we get<br>  <br>  (2u+2) + 3(u-1)^2 = 3(2u-2)(2u+2)(u-1)^2.<br>  <br>  If we move everything over to the right hand side and simplify, we get<br>  <br>  0 = 12u^4 - 24u^3 - 3u^2 + 28u - 17<br>  <br>  If you do calculus-type "curve sketching" here (which you could make rigorous with any number of theorems from analysis) you can see that this polynomial in u has exactly two roots, a negative one between -2 and -1 and a positive one between 1 and 2.  Since u = 2^x cannot be negative, we're interested only in that root between 1 and 2; whatever it is, call it k.  Solving for x we then get x = (ln k)/(ln 2) is the unique real solution of the original equation.  (Since k is between 1 and 2, x is between 0 and 1, but without a good way of approximating k I cannot get much more detailed than this.)<br>  <br>  It occurs to me that if the original equation had a fraction on the right hand side--- that is, 3/(2^(x+1) - 2) instead of 3(2^(x+1) - 2), then the equation in u = 2^x is<br>  <br>  1/(u-1)^2 + 3/(2u+2) = (3/2)/(u - 1)<br>  <br>  Multiplying both sides by (u-1)^2 (2u+2) to clear the denominators and moving everything to the right and simplifying, I get 8u^2 - 24u + 16 which has only the roots u = 1 and u = 2.  Since 2^x = 1 implies that x = 0 and the first fraction in the original equation is not defined when x = 0, we toss out u = 1 and consider only u = 2 (since u = 2^x this corresponds to x = 1).  This analysis shows that x = 1 is the only real to the original equation.  Since this answer is so much nicer, maybe this is the problem you meant to have posed.

RRFiy9CAaa	I'll assume k has to be real and I'll solve the equation before determining k. Also, I'll assume that in the equation -54 is instead +54; see the note at the end to see why. So let a and 3a be zeros, then we have:<br>  <br>  a^3 - ka^2 + 3a + 54 = 0 ----- (1)<br>  <br>  (3a)^3 - k(3a)^2 + 3(3a) + 54 = 0 => 27a^3 - 9ka^2 + 9a + 54 = 0 => 3a^3 - ka^2 + a + 6 = 0 ----- (2)<br>  <br>  (2) - (1): 2a^3 - 2a + 48 = 0 => a^3 - a + 24 = 0. This equation has 3 as a zero. Doing the requisite long division of a^3 - a + 24 by a - 3 we get a^3 - a + 24 = (x - 3)(a^2 + 3a + 8) = 0. So the other two possible values of a are given by the zeros of a^2 + 3a + 8. But a^2 + 3a + 8 has discrimminant 3^2 - 4(1)(8) = -23 < 0 i.e. imaginary zeros. But a imaginary => 3a imaginary. Since k is assumed to be real and with real polynomial equations imaginary roots occur in conjugate pairs, a and 3a must be conjugate, which is impossible. So a = 3 is the only possibility. So a = 3 is one root of the original equation and 3a = 9 is another. The product of roots is -(54) = -54. So the last root is -54/((a)(3a)) = -54/(3*9) = -2. The sum of roots is -(-k) = k = -2 + 3 + 9 = 10. Summarizing: k = 10, zeros = {-2,3,9}.<br>  <br>  Note: If we use the original equation, I still get a = 3 but substituting a = 3 back into (1), I get k = -2, but in (2), I get k = 26/3 i.e. cannot get a consistent value for k. So the equation cannot be solved as given. I think there must be a typo, most likely the -54 in the equation should instead be +54. With this change, the k computed from both (1) and (2) match up as 10.

tTg1XU8faa	You factor this by the difference of two cubes: a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). For this, the cube root of 8 is 2, so let that be a. The cube root of (3 - x)^3 is (3 - x), so let that be b.<br>  <br>  First start off with the (a - b) part. You would have (2 - (3 - x)), which is then (2 - 3 + x) = (-1 + x) or (x - 1).<br>  <br>  Now for the (a^2 + ab + b^2). a^2 would be 2^2 which equals 4. ab would be 2(3 - x) = 6 - 2x. And b^2 would be (3 - x)^2 = 9 - 6x + x^2 or x^2 - 6x + 9. So altogether, a^2 + ab + b^2 is 4 + 6 - 2x + x^2 - 6x + 9 = x^2 - 8x + 19.<br>  <br>  And so 8 - (3 - x)^3 factored is (x - 1)(x^2 - 8x + 19).

Each one of these WBCs has a slightly different specialty as they are all part of your immune system.  Eos tend to be increased during allergic reactions and infections by parasitic worms. But that doesn't apply to you because they would be much more elevated. Neutrophils and Lymphocytes are basically run of the mill WBCs, the Lymphocytes tend to increase with viral infections, while the segmented neutrophils increase in response to bacterial infections. The important thing to remember is that your body contains a normal number and distribution of these different kinds of white blood cells.

I don't really remember this stuff so well, so I studied up a little to help with this question.<br>  <br>  If an object is moving along and spinning at the same time (translating and rotating) , then it has two components of kinetic energy.  I will call them translating kinetic energy (TKE) and rotational kinetic energy (RKE).<br>  <br>  TKE is (1/2) * m * v^2<br>  <br>  RKE is (1/2) * I * w^2  (w is radians per second)<br>  <br>  He gives you the equation for (I) the moment of inertia, mass, and radius.  But he does not give the linear speed or the rotational speed?  Hmmm....<br>  <br>  Aha, that is why they want a ratio, then you can have your speeds cancel out on the top and bottom of the ratio.<br>  <br>  Ratio = (RKE) / (RKE + TKE) <br>  <br>  Now the trick will be to get the rotational speed in terms of the translational speed (or vise versa).  <br>  <br>  w = V / radius<br>  <br>  Don't plug in any numbers, keep all your variables until the last step, and then cancel out the speeds.<br>  <br>  ratio = (RKE) / (RKE + TKE) <br>  <br>  ratio = ((1/2) * I * w^2)) / (((1/2) * I * w^2) + ((1/2) * m * v^2)))<br>  <br>  ratio = ((1/2) * I * (v/r)^2)) / (((1/2) * I * (v/r)^2) + ((1/2) * m * v^2)))<br>  <br>  Now, all the v's cancel out, as do the 1/2 s.<br>  <br>  ratio = (I/r^2) / ((I/r^2) +m)<br>  <br>  or you could rewrite it like this<br>  <br>  ratio = 1 / (1 +((m * r^2) / I))<br>  <br>  But we know that I = (.25) * m * r^2  or (1/4) * m * r^2<br>  <br>  We could substitute this into our equation, just for fun, or solve it now (Solve for I, then plug I, m and r into our equation).  I like to keep the variables right to the very end, then only plug the numbers in once.<br>  <br>  ratio = 1 / (1 +((m * r^2) / I))<br>  <br>  ratio = 1 / (1 +((m * r^2) /((1/4) * m * r^2))<br>  <br>  ratio = 1 / (1 + (1/(1/4))<br>  <br>  ratio = 1 / (1 + 4)<br>  <br>  ratio = 1/5<br>  <br>  Wow, look at that, we did not even need m or r to solve this problem.  That is why I like to keep the variables all the way through.  I didn't mean to solve the problem for you, but the answer just fell out, lol.<br>  <br>  No need to plug in the numbers now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  PS Don't worry about asking for help,  as long as you use the info to learn.  Very few here will say "do your own homework" a few will, but ignore them.  Some here will just give the quickey answer with no explanation. If you still don't understand how to get the answer, ask more detailed questions until you DO understand it.<br>  <br>  PPS  When the problem comes up in class, ask your teacher if he (or she) can solve it without the values for mass and radius!|`|oaeD5B1taa	The LINEAR or translational kinetic energy of the sphere is<br>  <br>            KE = 1/2 M V^2<br>  <br>  the ROTATIONAL energy is 1/2 I (omega)^2<br>  <br>  but I = 0.25 M R^2 and (omega) = V/R because the linear speed of a point on the periphery of the sphere along a great circle that is in contact with the ground with respect to the axis of that sphere is identical to the translational speed of the sphere,<br>  <br>  so omega (angular velocity in radians / sec)  = V/R<br>  <br>  so rotational energy must be 0.25/2 M V^2<br>  <br>  You should be able to take it from there
oaeD5B1taa	This is college level stuff....you have professors and instructors in college, not "teachers" like they do in p.s. and it sounds like that lop you have is a "teacher"in name only and you aren't learning much.<br>  <br>  The first equation is simply the definition of density----density is mass divided by volume.....d = m/v  so what is your question there? What is the capital "V" for?<br>  <br>  The moment of inertia of a cylinder whose density varies from the center axis radially outward to the surface is found by integration-----you imagine the cylinder as composed of a large number of concentric cylinders of radial thickness dr. <br>  <br>  Well, the moment of inertia of each one of these thin walled elemental cylinders of wall thickness dr is<br>  <br>                        dI = d(mr^2) = 2(pi) rh dr *  density  * r^2<br>  <br>  or    dI = 2 (pi) r^3 h (1.98 - 0.99r + 0.368 r^2 ) dr<br>  <br>   then you integrate this differential from 0 to 0.48<br>  <br>  You of course can factor out the height of 0.63 as it is a constant and place it in front of the integral sign.<br>  <br>  This all make sense?|`|noU2uKEoaa	Moment of inertia<br>  <br>             I = ∫r2dm<br>  <br>  mass = volume X density = V.D<br>               <br>                    dm =  D.dV <br>  <br>  For cylinder   V = πr2.h<br>  <br>                      dV = 2πhrdr<br>  <br>                      dm = D.2πhrdr <br>  <br>                   r2 dm = D.2πhr^3.dr <br>  <br>  So    I  =  ∫ D.2πhr^3.dr <br>  <br>  You then substitute the expression for D<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

That is about as good as you can get without instruments.  You can also observe particular stars which will give you about the same measurement by the same means.|`|AA11564934	THey kept good enough records to know by location of the sun and other signs that they could mark one exact year|`|AA10873379	Time is a master thief. It steals precious seconds when you are not looking. Time is standard, it goes the same everyday, everywhere. What is different is how we measure time, and that is local to the people involved.<br>  <br>  Basically, in the olden times, time was measured from moon phase to moon phase. Month and moon have the same root. As time progressed man noticed that the stars changed on a regular basis. And soon it became apparent they changed to match the lunar monthly timing cycle. And after 12 or 13 lunar cycles the stars were in the same place at the same time. To help keep the measuring straight, they modified the lunar month so that the year would match up to when the stars were in the same place. This is still not exact. Today there are still several calender ideas that we are taught about in school. The Julian calender, the Gregorian, the Inca, the Aztec. These are all calenders that have been used to measure time. It works out that after all the changes, the 365 day calender equals the stars as long as we add a day every 4 years, except ending in zero, except divided by 100. This last New Years we added a "second" to 2008. So your question can now be changed to "how do people in the present know that a year consists of 365 days?"  Because we said so.|`|ldl8y9i2aa	ANALEMMA<br>  <br>  <a href="http://vrum.chat.ru/Photo/Astro/analema.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vrum.chat.ru/Photo/Astro/analema....</a><br>  <br>  The link shows an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.<br>  <br>  However, if you pound a stick in the ground in the center of a smooth flat level area and observe and mark the precise location of the tip shadow on the ground at the same time each day it will trace out an analemma on the ground in 1 year.<br>  <br>  Counting the elapsed days from when you start until the shadow tip returns to where it started will mark exactly one year.<br>  <br>  Try it out yourself!|`|6696c27f9097bbcf9d8f67589623d245aa	They used calendars or they used the movement of the sun to figure it out that there are roughly 265 days in the year when the sun gets to exactly the same position in the sky.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	watch and record the noon day sun with a sun dial|`|Q0ixYdQnaa	A year has never consisted of 365 days, in the times of the Romans it they estimated it to be 365.25 days which is the reason for the leap year. However, they realized that a year actually consisted of closer to 365.2425 days so all leap years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400 in which case they are leap years.

They soon learned the fact that 365 was not accurate. As a side note, back in the Roman empire days, Augustus Caesar's month had 31 days. This upset Julius Caesar.

So as the Earth moves around the sun, sometimes the northern hemisphere is more tilted towards the sun, sometimes the southern hemisphere is more tilted towards the sun.<br>  When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, it gets less direct sunlight so its cooler.  The days are shorter so the nights are longer and there is more time for the Earth to lose the heat it gained during the day.  So the north is in "winter".<br>  At the same time, the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and the sunlight is more direct (therefore warmer), the days are longer - it is summer.|`|WwXbso7saa	The rotation of the earth!!

The eccentricity is how stretched the orbit is, the higher the number, the longer the orbit.<br>  <br>  There's probably a formula for this, but I dont' know it.

YIimBqZPaa	An interesting question that I don't think anyone has an definitive answer to. I'm sure a proper google search will yield lots and lots of information on telomeres and free radicals and lipofuscin and melatonin and whatnot, which are all important pieces of the aging puzzle, but your question specifically stated why *humans* age, which is different from asking about aging in general. The thing is, not all creatures age at the same speed. A turtle could live for a centuries while a rat rarely gets past the age of five. <br>  <br>  From a genetic viewpoint, the body is not a piece of static machinery that continues  to function perpetually; it requires a steady stream of genetic maintenance as the years roll by (steady cell turnover to defy oxidative stress, an active immune system to keep cancerous cells at bay, etc). So, at the risk of gross oversimplification, you basically need specific anti-aging genes to keep you from aging.<br>  <br>  However, according to evolution, genes are only selected upon if they confer a reproductive advantage, something an anti-aging gene that keeps the body functioning well beyond its reproductive years does *not* do. Such an anti-aging gene would not be subjected to evolutionary pressure, and therefore would not be selected upon and passed down. What that basically means is, your genes think that maintaining an old, sterile body is useless, and would allow you to rot and die while they go off to take care of your younger and more virile offsprings.<br>  <br>  So the question becomes, why do creatures have different reproductive lifespans? That all depends on the survival strategies of that particular species. A shorter generation time means quicker spread of a beneficial mutation, which allows for quicker adaptation to a changing environment ( a good example would be antibiotic-resistant bacteria), but kinda sucks for knowledge and experience accumulation (humans). <br>  <br>  So, the lifespan of an animal is determined by its reproductive potential, which is dependent upon the survival strategy of that particular specie. That, I think, is why humans age differently from other animals.|`|CRWpzhUcaa	Humans age for a number of reasons.  One being that the cells that make up your body age and keep reprocuding, they therefore are passing on old pieces of themselves to their daughter generations.  As this process continues essentially all cells in the body contain pieces of very old cells.  These old pieces of cells are very succeptible to the elements and chemical interactions of the body.  Your metabolism also slows, which causes the reproductive process to slow, causing the existing cells to contain less and less ratios of newer pieces of cells.  When cells undergo mitotic division, if you watch cytokinesis, the two cells that are formed from one, each contain pieces of the cell membrane form the original cell, this is what i mean by "older pieces".  Extend this idea out to all organelles and you now can see the aging process on the microscopic level.  Another reason is that your brain stops your body from producing hormones and other cytokines, which essentially stops some chemical processes in the body.  This can be for a number of reasons, mainly an affect evolution, the offspring whose hormones shut off after a while tended to live longer, and thus were alive more time to reproduce.  After a long time, most of the living animals hormones stopped at a certain age.  These processes, if they dont stop, are shown to cause high rates of cancer, as they adversely affect aging cells, which are very sensitive to chemical imbalance and physiologic stress.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	because evolution improves organisms over time.<br>  and for evolution to work, new generations must replace old generations.<br>  old generations need to die to make space, and food, (ie not eat all the available food) for new generations.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	I'm guessing you are taking a course in biology.

0OvZQFwjaa	There are many ways to do this.  Here is the most sure-fire way I can think of.  There are other methods depending on special cases (easily determined x and y intercepts, etc), but this will work no matter what.<br>  <br>  Identify three ordered pairs on your graph:  (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3)<br>  <br>  Remember the general form of a quadratic equation:<br>  <br>  y = a x^2 + b x + c<br>  <br>  Write a system of equations where you substitute in a different ordered pair in each time.  This will give you three equations:<br>  <br>  y1 = a(x1)^2 + b(x1) + c<br>  y2 = a(x2)^2 + b(x2) + c<br>  y3 = a(x3)^2 + b(x3) + c<br>  <br>  You ultimately need to find the values of a, b and c.  Since you have three equations and you are solving for three variables, you can do this.  Just use Cramer's Rule or whatever method of solving a system of three equations you want form this point.<br>  <br>  Here's an example:  Let's say I saw the following points on the graph:<br>  (0, -4) (1, 0) and (-1, -4)<br>  <br>  So my system of equations is:<br>  <br>  -4 = a*0^2 + b*0 + c<br>  0 = a(1)^2 + b*1 + c<br>  -4 = a(-1)^2 + b*-1 + c<br>  <br>  Simplified:<br>  <br>  -4 = c<br>  0 = a + b + c<br>  -4 = a - b + c<br>  <br>  We got lucky and we know c = -4.  Substitute into the other two equations:<br>  <br>  0 = a + b - 4<br>  -4 = a - b - 4<br>  <br>  Rearranging a little:<br>  <br>  4 = a + b<br>  0 = a - b<br>  <br>  Add the two equations together:<br>  <br>  4 = 2a ~> a = 2<br>  <br>  4 = a + b<br>  <br>  4 = 2 + b<br>  <br>  b = 2<br>  <br>  So, the final equation for this parabola is y = 2x^2 + 2x - 4|`|AA11614996	Hi: <br>  <br>  Here something that can help: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.analyzemath.com/quadraticg/quadraticg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.analyzemath.com/quadraticg/qu...</a> - scroll drown and look  for exercise E  it explain it in detail. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|94NPSvGuaa	Observe where the quadratic graph intercepts the x-axis, which would usually be at two different points.<br>  <br>  For example, if a quadratic graph intercepts at x = 0.5 and x = 2.5, the quadratic equation would be:<br>  <br>  (2x - 1)(2x - 5) = 4x^2 -12x + 5<br>  <br>  However, there may be an instance when the x-axis is intercepted only once e.g. (x - 3)^2.<br>  <br>  For that graph, it would touch the x-axis at x = 3, so would be a translation of 3 units in the positive x-direction. Remember, always take the value of x when the bracket is 0, so y = 0.<br>  <br>  At the same time, the line of symmetry of the quadratic curve may be at the y-axis. All you would have to do then is look at the translation of the graph relative to the origin.<br>  <br>  For example, y = x^2 - 3 would intercept the y-axis at y = -3, whilst the graph y = x^2 + 3 would intercept the y-axis at y = 3.<br>  <br>  However, if the quadratic graph does not intercept the x-axis at all, there would be no real solutions to x. But, you could see where the stationary point (dy/dx = 0) is situated, and take into account the translations with respect to the origin.<br>  <br>  For example, there is a graph with a minimum point at (4,3).<br>  <br>  Then, the quadratic equation would be:<br>  <br>  y = (x - 4)^2 + 3<br>  <br>  y = x^2 - 8x + 19<br>  <br>  This is because the graph is translated 4 units in the POSITIVE x-direction, and 3 units in the POSITIVE y-direction!<br>  <br>  Positive coefficient of x^2:  Parabola is like a u ('concave up')<br>  <br>  Negative coefficient of x^2: Parabola is like an upside down u ('concave down')
