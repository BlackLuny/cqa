An excerpt or first couple chapters could sound good...but if its a crappy story its still a bad book despite how cool the first chapter is.

20090128090631AAZoiPn	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Problem concerning copyright?	I am about to write a book in which i will use an invented language and an invented script. One of the ideas of this script is to write the vowels above the consonants as diacritics. Recently i found out that J.R.R. Tolkien (the one who wrote the lord of the rings trilogy) already used this idea in his tengwar alphabet. Letters in my alphabet are very different than in his, the same is for the language, but the idea of writing vowels as diacritics is common.

20090127204434AAL5VT7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do u like my characters?	first we have Joe. he is a "genuine good guy. he is in his late 20s.he is short and muscular but overall average looking. his big heart makes up for his shortcomings. he works the night shift at one of the largest banks in the country. soon he will be laid off but is afraid to tell his girlfriend as their relationship has been strained lately. he loves lorelei with all his heart and she is number one in his life. he knows she treats him like dirt but loves her too much to let go. his short stature gives him low self-esteem so he keeps the sexy lorelei on his arm like a trophy. he doesnt think he can do any better than her.      next we have Lorelei(Joe's girlfriend) same age as Joe. she is tall and skinny and hot and she knows it. she has long ravenous brown hair and a curvacious body. she is snobbish with expensive taste. she loves guys with money which Joe has very little of. she was an adopted only child of parents who spoiled her and Joe has also been spoiling her for the past 7 years. but she is having doubts about the relationship as Joe has little time to spend with her mostly due to his strange work schedule. she has tried to leave Joe a couple of times but he begs her to stay. she feels guilty so she sticks with him. things had been so promising when she met Joe. thats when he was a pre-med student. she works in a grocery store and hates her job. but she likes the new manager and his large salary. she is constantly pointing out to Joe that other men would be better candidates than him.      then we have Ally. she is in her mid 20s. 4 years younger than Joe and Lorelei. non-smoker, light drinker(due to an incident on one particular occassion) she is short with a sexy body and a great personality. she likes to have fun and loves music. she has light brown hair and eyes like emeralds. she has a pointy nose and perfect teeth. she has a tattoo on the small of her back. her nose is pierced and so is her right eyebrow. she doesnt have a thing for pain but likes expressing herself through her skin. however she is not planning on doing anything else to her body. she is a sweetheart. kind, caring and loving. she is a cocktail waitress at a strip club. the job is fun and the money is great. she is not greedy as she gives Joe the money back when she tips him. this is what makes her unique along with the fact she is sweet even though she has the piercings. And while every other guy is lusting over her body, it is her big heart which Joe becomes attracted to. she works a lot as she is trying to pay her rent as well as make enough money for next semester's tuition plus she has a lot of credit card debt. she has a history of bad relationships and would like to meet one "genuine good guy". the younger Ally will give Joe the kick in the pants he needs to do something he really likes.       are these strong characters and what else do u want to know?   i looking for ways to build on these characters so tell me your opinions or ideas to make these characters stronger and this story better

I know i posted it before, but i didnt get many responses//      The roof of the building was cold under Michael’s bare feet. His hands were moist and his shaggy, dirty blonde hair was wet with nervousness.  His heart thudded hard in his deep chest and his arms trembled slightly.  He knew that today was the day that everything would be flipped upside-down. And he knew it would be purely because of his actions, which soon would change the lives of several people.   He looked over his shoulder at Cameron, who calmly sat on the old chimney like a statue under the cool night sky. On a day like this, Michael had no idea how someone could seem so utterly calm. No one else was; Jessica sat at the tip of the roof, pulling her fingers through her hair under her black hoody and tapping her foot against the roof. And Heidi was pacing back and forth across the roof, in deep thought. Michael felt pang of confusion as to why Cam acted like today was such a typical day. Everyone knew it wasn’t.    Jessica put her head between her knees and whispered softly, “Are you sure we’re actually going to do this?” She paused. “We really, really don’t have to send the message this way, I mean, is it really necessary?”    Cameron spoke up, “Jessica, you know there’s no other choice. He hesitated, “It has to be this way.”    “But when?” she asked timidly. Michael could hear the tremor of fear in her sad voice. And to be truthful, he felt just as fearful.   “As soon as morning goes by. Until then, just stop freaking out about everything. Soon, everything will be alright again.” Cameron answered, his eyebrows coming together slightly.   Jessica became silent. Michael could tell that the idea of what they were soon going to do made her unsure and very uneasy. He respected her feelings strongly, though. Unlike Cameron. Just thinking about what was about to happened made Michael be hit with a strike of vertigo. It was probably the same sickness Jess was feeling. He lowered himself down on the roof and dangled his legs over the side.  Four long stories of air lay below his toes.

20090128084702AAyQrKS	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I have recycled my 'octameter' to free-verse, opinions?	They used to say;   Ah, the great Lantern,   who blushes bright; its glow   seconded the moon, who pales.   Songs and medleys were composed   to your luminosity and servitude   to the humble abode of eight.   Hung high; on the alcove    you thought them as fools.      The pride of the orient.      Now, they say;   Lantern, how filthy!   curve bones, rusty and frail,   red paper skin, flaked and peeled,   tail limb, severed and dirty.   How the four had mocked:   your scars, an eyesore;   a sight unsightly.      Don’t you know?   Respect is flighty.      8 = auspicious number   4 = misfortune      I haven't given up on my octameter... I shall try it again sometime...

20090128091737AALKtea	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Wrote this poem...it just kind of flowed. i've never written one before,but it just makes so much sense to me.?	Well, i didn't think about writing it   but all these words just flowed into my head and i had to write it down      I was just wondering if anyone else feels the same way, because apparently, i do. :)       The days pass by   More sickening each day   They say love’s contagious    But they all complain    At how much hate   And sorrow they feel       Alone I sit    In this room, I think   About those who hate   The ignorance they share   Unfathomable to those   Who have no faith      In what is going    And what will happen      “the time will come   When all is fine”   Now, when’s the time?   The fact cannot be denied   That it may never come,   This may always remain   The appalling world   May always stay the same      As one just sits    Thinking of how    The days pass by   But no one to love      It just isn’t mutual   They all say   As friends watch   Oblivious to the grain      The grain of what   One truly sees   And how they think   It’s all just so delighting      To lie and steal    To hate, not love   Make a scene   For attention, none more      Forget their beliefs   Follow the crowd   The sickness spreads   But none see it all      All they see   Is the lies and the wrong   Never does one say   “How grateful I am   To live this life,   Sing this song,   Dance to the beat,    Of the lovely bird’s motif”       All one sees   In 2009    Is the war    And the blood   The malicious terrorist’s bomb      Racism exists   But is only denied   Although it’s proved   When a Muslim walks by      As the days pass   Sickening more   One cannot imagine    How much worse the world can get   But no one can truly know.          any suggestions?    Sorry it's long...i couldn't stop until that last line.    I know it's not very good, but it's my first one, so please be considerate

Let me introduce myself:   I’m the Lack of everything;   Who betrays his own ideas,   Who has blissful thirst for tears;   I am Nastiness and Fear.   Would you like to kiss me, dear?         Unashamed of whom I am,   I am looking for a prey,   Who can pray until, they say,   I have dinnertime that day;   And no matter who she is,   Beforehand I get my kiss.         Would you like to say something   Or it’s just your innocence,   Which is going to make me slim?   But I cannot break my dream:   Full of anger, gripe and grimness,   My heart hasn’t known forgiveness.         Thus, they say, I’ll be the man   Who will conquer everything;   Every mountain will be climbed   By the beast I keep inside;   But as soon as I’m just me,   They say I’m in a fantasy.         So what’s the point for me of being   If the world is that unreal,   If Power and Strength   Break whatever stands ahead?   It doesn’t matter who I kiss,   The point is of being like this.

20090127204540AAMaBAe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing an unauthorized biography, getting permission, etc?	I’m currently writing a book – a sort of unauthorized biography on a minor celebrity (not exactly a household name but has a small dedicated cult following) - and just looking for a bit of advice on a few things.       Firstly, I want to use some small quotes here and there taken from interviews that the celebrity has done on radio and in newspapers and I'm guessing most would recommend that I obtain permission to do this. If I email the people that wrote the interviews and they email me back saying that it's fine to use the quotes, is that enough? Or do I need to send them a more official form to fill out? I've also interviewed the celebrity myself via email previously - but do I still need to ask for their permission if I want to use the interview for the book?       I'm a very big fan of the celebrity and it worries me that they could potentially be unhappy that I'm writing this book about them and the fact that they wouldn't make any money out of it since it's an 'unauthorized biography'. But just to be sure, would they be entitled to make any money from it (since they are the main subject of the book) even though I'm the one who has written it and spent all this time researching it? Any help at all with any of the above or anything else I should be aware of would greatly appreciated :)

20090128102711AANOFGf	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I've been engaged for fourteen years, what should I do?	I am a performer at the Hot Box Club. I've got a fiance, Nathan Detroit. We've been engaged for fourteen years! And he is still in no hurry to marry me, so much he us preoccupied with his "business" (mostly betting and gambling). I disapprove of it strongly. Today is the fourteenth anniversary  of our engagement. And he didn't even buy me a gift (I bought him one though). I told Nathan that I got a raise, and think that we should marry at last. I had had a wedding veil for three years, and I told my mother that Nathan and I were married and had five children! Even worse, I developed a chronic cold, I am constantly sneezing, and my symptoms are psychosomatic, because I am frustrated at being engaged that long! I explained all this to Nathan(even showed him a medical book), told him that a person could develop the flu if she still got the feeling she was naked from looking    at her left hand, and had so much virus inside, that her microscope slide looked like a day at the zoo, and that just from wanting her memories in writing, and a story her folks could be told, a person could develop a cold. But he would not listen to me, and refuses to marry! What should I do?

This day,the bird, it flits from branch to branch.   The ever moving now embraces past and future.   They are one.   Complaining murmurs of the past are future's loss.   No thought needed,no preference made.   Now on the ever- moving present dwell.   Like water, our awareness flows,caught by nothing,deep stillness,sits lowest,rises high,goes far.   The essence of now is tasted,   for without this moment nothing is.

Then,the sound of the glass bottle opened.   Then,then Pepsi bottle is opened and poured.   He is drinking again.   Not sure if it is safe to see what is going on,   Peeking around the side,   He sees,   And laughs.   He is in a good mood tonight,   But tomorrow he may be furious.   Never being able to know,   Scary.   Ruining his life,   Living day by day.   One day maybe he'll realize,   Money is not well spent on Jack Daniels.   One day maybe he'll realize,   Life can't be taken so easily.   Why bother saying these things,   He will never realize how much of an alcoholic he is.   He denies it.   All of a sudden,   Screaming starts.   Peeking around the corner,   He is no longer in his upbeat mood.   He screams and shouts,   Carrying on like the child his drunken state makes him.   He finishes his screaming,   Goes for another drink,with Pepsi,   And the cabinet closes.   He will wake up tomorrow,   And will be who he is each day.   The average male.

I'm a freshman so I'll be trying out for my sophomore year.   I have had about two years of prior training. I have been trying to practice as often as possible.      I am mostly nervous about my presentation. I have more experience dancing than I do auditioning and presenting myself. I know smiling is important, but is there any other advice?      Do they judge you on physical appearance? I'm not fat, but not really in the best shape [I'm working on core work to prepare], I'm pretty curvy, too. But, does it really matter?      I also have some trouble picking up on moves quickly, any tips?   Generally, what moves do they expect me to know?      Tips about nervousness, too... ?         Any advice is great, Thanks! :]

The burning desire to cut and to bleed  Builds up my shallow heart  The red races when I see your face  Pulsating to a degree of a dirty explosion  Slashing your wrists intrigue me  As the ruby red flows down your hands  Trickling into my mouth  Shredding my nails across your back   The ripping of your tender skin,  Leaves me breathless in all ways  As the blood seeps through the broken mess  The taste of your blood poisons my mouth  As the iron seeps down my desperate throat  The longing of this sensation has been dearly missed  As the real me comes to life...

It has always been a constant in humanity that there is no such thing as selflessness, only selfishness exists. No one can honestly say they do things for others out their heart for there in exists the selfishness because if a person dedicated their life to doing something that helped someone and then someone else said that you should give it up, then you said no, then you are selfish. It's one sided almost. Humans can not be selfless in their actions when it is selfishness when a choice is made, even when it is for a good thing.      What do you think?

She always dreamt of a handsome, presentable, respectable, sweet, loyal and amiable man to come, perfect as a prince charming, to whisk her away to the life of no troubles. He had to be perfect, in order for her to fall in love with him...perfect. And then, a transition, a change happened in her deepest thoughts and she ended up falling in love with a man, who was flawed even more than a regular human; she never realized how...   Her whole life she hated men like him, egoistic, selfish, cynical, proud and rude. But he had a certain edge to him, a certain craziness that attracted her; something she’d never experienced before. Though rebellious, he was outstandingly intelligent, and goal-oriented. Most important of all though, he was mysterious, with a sarcastic smile frozen on his face as if to hide his real feelings, his real self.   Real feelings...ah, yes! That’s what intrigued her the most. With her wild imagination, she always knew what his real thoughts were. She always believed that his heart was good, that his soul was pure, as that of a child’s...yet he had to mask it all because of his fear of life and his fear of love. At least that’s what she thought, until he did...fall in love.    He fell in love reasonably, though not with her; reasonably meaning, with a girl that was of good looks, fortune and intelligence and. However, she played him like a fool, took his heart and butchered it...it was the first time anyone ever saw him cry. He never realized the one who really loved him, was right in front of him; the girl who was ready to take his flaws and make them her epitome of perfection; the girl for whom he meant the world. He pushed her away, thus making himself even more perfect than before...staying mysterious, unattainable and wild.

20090128151342AASrXjc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What are the benefits to writing a non-fiction book versus just making into a blog?	I have about 75% of a non-fiction book complete and am wondering how to compare its value (in terms of profitability to me) as a book, which is difficult to sell, versus presenting it as a blog, which would likely garner a lot of interest but yield only advertising revenue?      I am hesitant to just give away all my hard work for free at this point, but I am aware how difficult it is to have a publisher take interest in your book & then have it be a success.      Are there any benefits to a combination of both?      Any advice from existing authors is greatly appreciated.
20090128152636AAFPM8E	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good start for my story?	I'm writing a story. Here's the plot. Sorry for the non-exsistence of the caps in the next few paragraphs:      so, there's this community and it's very perfect with many silly laws(similar to the giver), but not AS strict. yet, there is no music, no love and ect. the people in the community figure there's probably something else out there, but don't feel the need to leave. everything they need (so they think) is with them. they live on an island surrounded by much ocean. one day, two siblings come along from another community. they bring new things to the community like love, music and ect. (as i mentioned before). but, these things aren't legal, so they must be kept secret.      i haven't thought of anything else yet. comments, suggestions and ect. are much appreciated! Well, here's my start of the story:         I guess we never really thought about anywhere else. Everything we could ever need was right here on the island. The papayas and bananas were ripe from the trees every morning and the cotton seed planted on the farmer’s grounds made the softest clothing. The wild berries which grew on the trees were used to make the most vivid of all paints and the icy water from the stream was oh so refreshing to drink or bathe in after a long day.   On a warm, breezy day, I was riding my bicycle down the sidewalk to school. Although we all lived very close to the building, I was on the outskirts of town and therefore a little further away than everyone else. I probably could’ve walked, but I loved the feeling of the wind in my hair and my legs moving as fast as a little hummingbird’s wings.   On and on I rode, for about 20 minutes, when all of a sudden I heard the speakers crackle with excitement above my head. The speakers never turned on. In fact, they had only been turned on twice in my lifetime. Twice in sixteen years. The first time they were turned on was when a community member left on his newly-made boat. The second time was when that same community member’s body washed up on shore. I suspected it would happen. After all, it was a very tiny wooden boat. A funeral was held the day after. The community was buzzing with silly thoughts and opinions, ‘Poor man,’ and, ‘He deserved it. He did a foolish thing, leaving the island, and he paid. He knew there wasn’t anything else out there.’ The people suspected there were just a few other islands besides our own. They figured they were probably the same or very similar to ours. At least, that’s what they thought until the Brightens came.   I waited patiently to hear what the speakers had to say. It took a long time for them to start functioning properly after being turned on because they weren’t used very often. While waiting, boys who looked to be about my age stopped pedaling their bicycles and held down the brakes so their bikes would cease next to mine. Their bikes gleamed next to mine. Although all of our bicycles look the same, I hadn’t had time to wash mine since I had gotten it. Every boy gets a bright blue bicycle with shiny silver breaks on their sixteenth birthday. Conveniently, our birthdays were all within a month of each other, so we got our bicycles near the same date. As boys took off their helmets (also blue, to match the color of the bicycles), I realized I was acquainted with the presence of my friends. After a few seconds, I recognized the clumsy-looking one who was still having difficulty taking off his helmet was in fact Theodore. Finally, he managed to pull the helmet off of his head. He shook out his long dark hair which was in desperate need of a haircut.   “Hey, Ryan,” Brendon said, his big brown eyes gleaming.   “Hey, Brendon.” I replied, reluctantly. My mother had warned me against Brendon Morris. She said that he was a little too adventurous, a little too mischievous.   The speaker crackled once again.   “Be quiet, guys, I think they’re about to say something important!” said Theodore, always worrying.
20090128151952AADM72i	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Can immortality be achieved?	Is it possible to become immune to ending of life, and I don't mean in the philosophical sense like when some writes a story that becomes famous or a when a person actions become known for ages, but pure eternal life where we do not grow old and our bodies can not be injured.    I read that medical scientists proved why we grow old and that if were to overcome this cell deficiency then we would remain young. If this was achieved could it be taken to the next step, eternal, unrestricted existence, where nothing short of a black hole can end us (or trap us?)
