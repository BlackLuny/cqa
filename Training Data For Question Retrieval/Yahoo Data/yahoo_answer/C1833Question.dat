I can't type, I can't click on anything in the top bars. I can only print or open documents. I cannot edit.      If I attempt to type, a message in the bottom right-hand corner says, "The modification is not allowed because the selection is locked."

No pop ups, no messages...nothing.      I've given you a fairly detailed description of my dilemma and help would be EXTREMELY helpful....      Thank you.

20090203112516AAxb5YQ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Please help me choose an all-in-one printer?	I asked about this yesterday and only got one response and the response I did get was for an AIO that got horrile reviews from every printer review site.  I am so overwhelmed by the choices and I don't want to be sorry with my choice.  I am not a heavy printer.  I want to spend $170.00 or less.  I want to scan photos and get good results.  I don't care about speed.  I am a stay at home mom and have plenty of time to wait for photos to scan and print.  I don't copy large texts, so , I don't think I need a document feeder, but, if it has one that is fine.  I would prefer wireless.  I have Vista, so I need something that is compatible (truly compatible) with Vista.  I have heard nothing but bad things about Lexmark, so I have taken them off my list.  Some of the ones I do have on my "consideration list" are- Epson RX595 Photo Inkjet, HP C6380 Photosmart, HP OfficeJet 6310, Brother MFC 440 CN.  Those are not the only ones I would consider, I would love to hear any pros and cons on any AIO's!  Oh, I have a Canon iP1800 (got it free with my computer) and I want to print coupons from the internet, but, the sites say my printer is not compatible.  So, if anyone knows anything about that...I need a printer that is compatible.  Thanks
20090203110121AAkHzs4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What laptop would be best?	Hiya, could you help me in finding what laptop would best suit me needs? (University)      First off, i don't need it for games, amazing graphics, or even memory space (I've got a 80gb memory thing which I'll be saving everything to not the laptop in case it crashes.)      What i do need is    1) something that runs really fast and won't leave me waiting ages for pages to load, so a very good working memory. (whatever that is? :P) for instant i use ancestry.co.uk a lot and I'll often have 50+ webpage's pages open at once.   2) Not easily breakable, or prone to glitches. I'm not saying I'm going to throw the thing at the wall, but i don't want some temperamental laptop that keeps crashing or acting up.   3) Somewhat stylish/sleek in appearance.   4) around the ￡1,000 mark   5) Not a mac, my friend has one and it drives me nuts :P      Any help would be much appreciated. :)   x

20090203105607AADUBKI	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Computer help? May be a virus?	Recently, my computer has been acting up. After it is on for an extended amount of time it begins to run very slowly - my mouse cursor jumps around the screen when I move and responds slowly. Also, when I watch streaming video the sound and video go out of sync. Programs take longer to open etc.    I downloaded PCTuner to clean up old registry files and stuff like that - it found a lot of junk and my CPU usage went from flatlining at 100% to  jumping up and down again. But I still have the same problem: after the computer has been on for awhile it slows down. And even when I have NO programs open the CPU is jumping around all over the place. And when I go to Processes Internet Explorer is taking up the most CPU time - or whatever it is- and its not even open!?   Is this a virus? If so, where can I download the best free software to get rid of it?   Thank you soo  much for reading my rambling
