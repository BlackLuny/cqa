cMY7mN4paa	Brutus is essentially the trajic hero. He has all the traits of being a hero, except for the fact that he was able to have been manipulated into murdering Julius DCasaer (though it is important to still remember that he believed Casaer had become corupt and power hungry, and so thought he was saving the people of Rome by doing this, which are technically noble actions, especially viewed as noble actions back in Shakespear's time when royalty were notorious for being tyranical greedy beats who took all your taxes, sort of, ok lets just say the Kings and Queens werent the favourite people of the middle or lower classes. Also, Cassius really pulled one on Brutus when he planted letters from the plebians crying out for Brutus, as he would not have killed Casaer if he didn't think it was what Rome wanted and needed). <br>  <br>  Anyways, back in Shakespear's time there was this feeling of cosmic stability that had to be maintained, and if you murdered someone above you in rank, that order was throne into choas untill it was righted again (a theme that also resounds quite clearly in many of his other trajedies, including Macbeth significantly. Also, interestingly enough, the ancient egyptians called this cosmic stability "ma'at", which was the Pharaoh's divine job to maintain), so when Brutus murders Casaer, the balance would be thrown completely off-kilter, thus Octavious resets the order through "commiting justice".<br>  <br>  Right, so the life lessons that can be learned would be a) don't upset the balance of life b) don't fix something unless it's broken (as casaer was actually quiet beloved by his plebians) c) beware those who are power hungry and wish to corrupt you d) no matter what the creepy man with greed in his eyes says, don't kill your best friend e)if you think your best friend (who just so happens to be king) is to ambitious, pull him aside and maybe mention something about it to him, don't plunge a knife in his back (umm hi its called civilized verbal problem solving) f) as very longly described in sparknotes, Brutus is a rigid moral compass, ironically leading him to do the exact wrong thing (it seems to be a pattern in Shakespearian literature that all of his villians are simply very 'logical' people) From spark notes:"Brutus’s rigid idealism is both his greatest virtue and his most deadly flaw. In the world of the play, where self-serving ambition seems to dominate all other motivations, Brutus lives up to Antony’s elegiac description of him as “the noblest of Romans.” However, his commitment to principle repeatedly leads him to make miscalculations: wanting to curtail violence, he ignores Cassius’s suggestion that the conspirators kill Antony as well as Caesar. In another moment of na?ve idealism, he again ignores Cassius’s advice and allows Antony to speak a funeral oration over Caesar’s body. As a result, Brutus forfeits the authority of having the last word on the murder and thus allows Antony to incite the plebeians to riot against him and the other conspirators. Brutus later endangers his good relationship with Cassius by self-righteously condemning what he sees as dishonorable fund-raising tactics on Cassius’s part. In all of these episodes, Brutus acts out of a desire to limit the self-serving aspects of his actions; ironically, however, in each incident he dooms the very cause that he seeks to promote, thus serving no one at all." <br>  <br>  Another good life lesson (from spark notes aswell, i swear that site is a genius): "Much of the play’s tragedy stems from the characters’ neglect of private feelings and loyalties in favor of what they believe to be the public good. Similarly, characters confuse their private selves with their public selves, hardening and dehumanizing themselves or transforming themselves into ruthless political machines. Brutus rebuffs his wife, Portia, when she pleads with him to confide in her; believing himself to be acting on the people’s will, he forges ahead with the murder of Caesar, despite their close friendship. Brutus puts aside his personal loyalties and shuns thoughts of Caesar the man, his friend; instead, he acts on what he believes to be the public’s wishes and kills Caesar the leader, the imminent dictator."|`|sop6UrDOaa	that his job was not meant to be

PTdy6TWRaa	Some rocks will never polish up to a glossy shine depending on the density and mineral content. Your best chances are with some igneous and metamorphic rocks or crystals. Softer sedimentary rocks are not the best candidates for polishing.<br>  <br>  If your rock is of a suitable type for polishing then using a rock tumbler is the easiest way to go.<br>  <br>  If your rock isn't suitable for polishing you could always lacquer it to give it a similar feel and appearance.<br>  <br>  Engraving the stone may be done with a Dremel tool and special hardened bit.  <br>  <br>  You probably don't want to buy a rock tumbler for doing just one stone so you might try to find a hobbyist willing to do you a favor. Rock collecting and tumbling is a fun hobby, especially if you have kids, so if you were interested in getting a tumbler you could find a hobby version starting in the $50-$75 range. You will need additional supplies (various sanding grits) that may cost you another $10 or so per load of rocks you tumble.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you do put your heart shaped rock into a tumbler do it on its own, not with a collection of other rocks. Usually when you use a tumbler for polishing you try to fill it with rocks of similar type and hardness. If a softer one is in the mix it may get chipped and damaged badly by the other harder stones. Good luck!

AA11898755	An artist ( I speak of painting, but the details are applicable to any discipline) can absolutely be called a master while alive. It is more about the complete package of his practice than about the reputation and fame that he may or may nor achieve in art history. Knowing the nature of paint as a chemical compound, and having total mastery of his chosen method of applying the paint. Having the complexity of thought that allows his works to speak through subject and composition, but also through the very colors and strokes themselves to create an active subtext. These are the kinds of qualities, among others demonstrated by a master artist. There are living masters of Kitsch and low art like Kinkade and masters of great and lasting artistic authority like Nerdrum, Tansey,  Botero and many others.|`|3ERx4opSaa	Well thats a pretty vague question, are you referring to a master of a certain medium, like oils, or a master of a design element? like a master of balance, rythm, line, movement, form etc?<br>  <br>  Also do you mean the title "master" is one of physical abillity or a mental claim by critics or one's self?<br>  <br>  Well in my opinion, a master artist is an artist who has learned to create meaningful art, art that will be remembered for years to come. Then that brings us to another question, what is meaningful art? I think it could be simply said art that has more importance than its physical apperance.<br>   As for your second question, there is a split opinion on that one. If you believe yourself that your art is meaningful, you can attain the "master" title within your life. If you base the title soley upon the views of others, you may not acheive it within your lifetime.|`|GljTmVliaa	In my humble opinion, I believe it is a painting that moves the person that is observing the painting. Look at a painting like Dali's The Persistence of Memory. Say the title a few times in your head and look at every detail then take a step back. If you can do that with a painting and say amazing then I consider it a masterpiece. It has to have meaning to it for it to become a masterpiece.

I own a store so take it from there LOL...<br>  <br>  If you want a fat bluesy, rock sound, then Gibson will give you just that. I have big hands so I settled for a Charvel/Jackson with active pickup which gives me the nice mellow Fender sound and the bite of Gibson. Their necks are the fastest playing necks on the market.<br>  <br>  Now , getting back to your Fender, that is a good buy and over time, you will get double your money back because of the demand.<br>  As for checking the neck with the pick for spacing is unrealisitic. When you pay top dollar, the guitar has been checked before leaving the factory.|`|OQPxURekaa	Play a lot of different ones and you will almost certainly learn to differentiate between one tone and another.

I had the specific body type an art professor needed to do a sculpture he was privately commissioned to do. I did my first drawing group that same summer and began doing college classes that fall right after I turned 17. I did this all through college and have continued now post-college to do it as a way to share my body with artists thereby being a part of the creative process. <br>  <br>  In one drawing group session during my first summer doing this, I was one of four models brought in for the group to draw. It was a study in contrast. I was the youngest, shortest and most built, then there was a tall, thin, balding guy in his 30's, a rather overweight guy in his 50's and a guy that had to be 80 years old and was average build for his age. We all posed completely nude for the group so that they could do direct contrast. <br>  <br>  In college, my (then) boyfriend and I were both models for our fine art department as well as the other colleges in the city. I only knew of a couple of other college students who were - the rest were all from their mid 20's to their 70's and varied in body type and build. My boyfriend and I were both short (5'7" in our bare feet) and he was slightly less muscular than I was. He and I posed together a lot too because of being the same age and height, but my proportions being different despite both of us having a 28" waist. The art instructors want you to be able to interperet the distinctions and contrasts. <br>  <br>  The hardest thing in finding models for art, as any professor will tell you, is finding someone who is willing to be reliable, punctual and willing to show up and take their clothes off. <br>  <br>   I have found to be true what my partner has told me (he is an artist) and that is - a real inherent beauty can be found in any human body, in that it is a magnificent machine. A true artist will find it. <br>  <br>  Maybe only half of the models are older or overweight.

AA12182122	~Why would he want to have her killed?  Or have to?<br>  <br>  If you love studying the Tudors, you know that Henry's marriage to Catherine was annulled by Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer.   When Pope Clement VII, declared the declaration of nullity to be null and void, he effectively divorced England from the Roman Church, but English law sanctioned the annulment and the legitimacy of the marriage to Anne Boleyn.  The marriage to Catherine having been terminated, at least by English law (which was all that really mattered given the growing conflict with the church over far bigger issues than matrimonial law) it was not a problem for Henry and neither was Catherine.<br>  <br>  Anne  wasn't lucky enough to have been married to Arthur.  The marriage was on the rocks anyway, and by the time Anne miscarried Henry's precious son in January 1536,  Hank was already getting it on with Jane Seymour.  Anne was a much more credible potential enemy than Catherine had been and Anne had far more influence in the halls of power in England.  Grounds for annulment could have been found, I'm sure, but a second annulment so quickly, on the heels of schism with Rome, may have been too much for the English nobility (and hoi poloi) to swallow.  Any way, a live Anne after an annulment was a dangerous idea.  Off went the head.  An internal rebellion was a far, far more serious, real and dangerous threat than was a war with Spain.  A live Anne would have been a constant knife at Henry's throat.<br>  <br>  Jane was lucky.  She died of natural causes, opening the door for Anne of Cleves.  The question of annulling the marriage with her, or of annulling her herself, never arose.  The marriage to Anne of Cleves was strictly a political union, doomed from before the vows were exchanged.  Henry wanted to back out (especially after meeting her and seeing her for the first time) but couldn't because the political alliance was more important.  However, by mutual consent, the marriage was annulled after only six months on the grounds that it had never been consummated and Anne was well provided for.  Everything considered, the grounds may have been true.<br>  <br>  Catherine Howard was executed for treason.  The circumstantial evidence of her adultery was fairly compelling.  Although she refused to admit her marital affairs (her pre-marital escapades were damning enough), it is more than probable that she did the deed with at least Thomas Culpeper.  Adultery by a queen was treason.  Bye bye Kate.  I suspect both she and Henry recognized immediately what a mistake the marriage was and wished they hadn't done it.  Catherine was dumb and handed her head to Henry on a silver platter.  Her actions begged for her execution. <br>  <br>  Of the six, only two were beheaded.  Henry didn't love 'em and lop off their heads unless compelling circumstances required desperate measures.  Catherine Howard was doomed by her own conduct.  Anne was doomed by the exigent circumstances and by the strength of her will and her lust for power, the people who were beholden to her and her political allies.  Her execution was something of an act of self defense on Henry's part.  Letting Catherine of Aragon live was an easy choice because she posed no real threat.  Executing her may have caused problems with Spain, but no more so than dumping her did.   The annulment was a provocation in and of itself, especially when Mary was declared illegitimate and removed from the line of succession.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	Worse than that, it would have provoked war with Spain.|`|5a4dVSvIaa	The marriage of Catherine and Henry was political. Killing Catherine would have caused hostilities with Spain, and England could have been crushed by the Spanish Armada.  Also, he had no reason kill Catherine, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were executed for high treason. Anne Boleyn was accused of cheating on Henry because their child was born with red hair (it wasn't known that the gene that causes red hair was recessive, Henry assumed the red hair came from another man. He was also angry he didn't get a son). Catherine Howard was young and foolish, and was caught cheating on Henry. Catherine of Aragon, however, hadn't done anything to anger Henry, and Henry didn't want to anger Spain.|`|OhWmu0R3aa	Unlike Henry's other five wives, she had more powerful connections. If Henry had executed her, then it was likely there would have been an immediate conflict with Spain and the shattering of England's oldest alliance with Portugal where Catherine's older sibling was queen and her nephew the future John III. Even more discomforting would be the possibility of conflict with her other nephew Ferdinand I , Holy Roman Emperor, which if united with his brother, Charles I of Spain, would have created one of the largest forces to unite against a single country.<br>  <br>  Also, in his arrogance, Henry rather expected the Pope to grant the divorce since he had previously given Henry the title "defender of the faith", leading Henry to believe he would have the Pope's blessing on most of his actions.

lmVDvmMCaa	This is a common question, and I will attempt to help you the best I can. <br>  <br>  If your ancestors are from the Philippines (there is a Mount Arayat there) then you probably have no arms to inherit.  <br>  <br>  If you cannot trace your paternal ancestry to a documented armiger, then in the USA you may freely adopt an original design. In Scotland and England you must (merely) pay the heraldic authority for the right to bear a coat of arms.<br>  <br>  There are no surname coats of arms!<br>  <br>  How did the myth of surname arms start? A clever marketer took some heraldry books and made a database of many coats of arms. Instead of recording the actual person who bore the arms, he just associated a surname with each one (often the surname of the original armiger). The point of this scam was to increase the number of people who would identify with a particular design, even though by tradition using an unrelated person's arms is theft. This clever scam has made millions for the con artists and made fools of many people.<br>  <br>  The International Association of Amateur Heralds and the American Heraldry Society are good places to begin your research about heraldry.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.amateurheralds.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.amateurheralds.org</a><br>  <a href="http://americanheraldrysociety.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanheraldrysociety.com</a>|`|AA12343309	If this is a school assignment, please print off the answers you have received and give them to your nitwit teacher.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a family crest.  A crest is part of a coat of arms. Coats of arms do not belong to surnames. They were granted to or assumed by an individual man.   When a man was granted one in Britain, for instance, all sons were entitled to apply and have one granted with some differences.  Only the oldest son inherits his father's upon his  father's death.  <br>  <br>  The following are links  regarding heraldry of various countries. Please print them off and give to your teacher..<br>  <br>  The bad thing about them is usually a family history comes with them and it will not be the family history of everyone with the same surname.    People have been misled when starting their familyhistory.<br>  <br>  If any of your fellow classmates have a picture of a coat of arms, it is no doubt not theirs.  It belongs to one man and one man only.  If they display it like it is theirs, they are guilty of usurping another man's identity.  How can anyone with pride in themselves and their family want to take on another's person's identity??<br>  <br>  Websites like House of Names and AllFamilyCrest are scam merchants. Anybody selling them at shopping malls, in airports, in magazines are scam merchants.<br>  <br>  Now, House of Names does have a small disclaimer in small print.  They state<br>  <br>  "We encourage you to study the  (name) family history to find out if you descend from someone who bore a particular family crest. ... . . . . . . .. .<br>  No families, not even royal houses, can make sound claim to the right to bear arms unless a proven connection is established through attested genealogical records."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  They use the misnomer "family crest."|`|2wyDALHgaa	It can actually look like what ever you want it to look like.<br>  <br>  A common misconception is that family names can have crests designed for them but this is actual not the case.  In most heraldic traditions an individual, rather than a family, had a coat of arms. In those traditions coats of arms are legal property transmitted from father to son; wives and daughters could also bear arms modified to indicate their relation to the current holder of the arms. Essentially each generation who received a coat of arms would modify that coat of arms to represent themselves and their generation.  <br>  <br>  While my family name may be Robinson (it's not) I'm actually not the head of my family and therefore any coat of arms registered to the Robinson's actually belong to the head of the family that registered it, in this case in Scotland.  <br>  <br>  I'm more then free to design my own family crest or coat of arms and, if I want to spend the money, I can registered it with the proper authorities.  I'd say that if you want to do some research into your family and design your own in accordance with proper heraldic traditions then it would not only be more then relevant to you but it would also be a personal memento you could pass on to your decedents as well as a hobby and learning experience for you.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind also that depending upon where your family descends from there may not be a heraldic tradition that would have created a crest or coat of arms.  That doesn't mean you can't create one now though.

With German traders and merchants already engaged world-wide, he encouraged colonial efforts in Africa and the Pacific ("new imperialism"), in essence for the German Empire to stand up to other European powers for the remaining “unclaimed” territories. Germany acquired German Southwest Africa (todays Namibia), German Kamerun (Cameroon), Togoland, and German East Africa (the mainland part of current Tanzania). Islands were gained in the Pacific through purchase and treaties, as well as a 99-year lease for the territory of Kiautschou in north east China.

Amen.|`|VNb7QqN4aa	Now why do you ask this question? Why are you asking me to tell you the meaning of life, the purpose of life? What do we mean by life? Does life have a meaning, a purpose? Is not living in itself its own purpose, its own meaning? Why do we want more? Because we are so dissatisfied with our life, our life is so empty, so tawdry, so monotonous, doing the same thing over and over again, we want something more, something beyond that which we are doing. Since our everyday life is so empty, so dull, so meaningless, so boring, so intolerably stupid, we say life must have a fuller meaning and that is why you ask this question. Surely a man who is living richly, a man who sees things as they are and is content with what he has, is not confused; he is clear, therefore he does not ask what is the purpose of life. For him the very living is the beginning and the end. Our difficulty is that, since our life is empty, we want to find a purpose to life and strive for it. Such a purpose of life can only be mere intellection, without any reality; when the purpose of life is pursued by a stupid, dull mind, by an empty heart, that purpose will also be empty. Therefore our purpose is how to make our life rich, not with money and all the rest of it but inwardly rich - which is not something cryptic. When you say that the purpose of life is to be happy, the purpose of life is to find God, surely that desire to find God is an escape from life and your God is merely a thing that is known. You can only make your way towards an object which you know; if you build a staircase to the thing that you call God, surely that is not God. Reality can be understood only in living, not in escape. When you seek a purpose of life, you are really escaping and not understanding what life is. Life is relationship, life is action in relationship; when I do not understand relationship, or when relationship is confused, then I seek a fuller meaning. Why are our lives so empty? Why are we so lonely, frustrated? Because we have never looked into ourselves and understood ourselves. We never admit to ourselves that this life is all we know and that it should therefore be understood fully and completely. We prefer to run away from ourselves and that is why we seek the purpose of life away from relationship. If we begin to understand action, which is our relationship with people, with property, with beliefs and ideas, then we will find that relationship itself brings its own reward. You do not have to seek. It is like seeking love. Can you find love by seeking it? Love cannot be cultivated. You will find love only in relationship, not outside relationship, and it is because we have no love that we want a purpose of life. When there is love, which is its own eternity, then there is no search for God, because love is God.       It is because our minds are full of technicalities and superstitious mutterings that our lives are so empty and that is why we seek a purpose beyond ourselves. To find life's purpose we must go through the door of ourselves; consciously or unconsciously we avoid facing things as they are in themselves and so we want God to open for us a door which is beyond. This question about the purpose of life is put only by those who do not love. Love can be found only in action, which is relationship.  J Krishnamurthy(The First And Last Freedom)

yU132xUvaa	on broadway? ive sat in the first row. they leave a lot of space (like 20ish feet) between the stage and the rows  i was absolutely fine!|`|qN6Bq0Emaa	I always like sitting in the 1st balcony.  Get to see the stage better.  But you're within spitting distance. You can see the actors spit when they speak !!!!|`|YbwDFvEaaa	If you've already seen PoTO from balcony seats, then I think you will enjoy having a completely different perspective from 5th row, up close and personal-like! You'll be able to see more details of the stage work there for one, and those flashy effects are even more booming from the orchestra seats!    I personally sat in the front mezzanine when I went to see PoTO and the chandelier flew directly over my head when it dropped. Scary, but awesome!|`|nkU7m16Daa	5th row.....well it probably is too close unless you like looking almost straight up and hurting your neck. my mom and i sat 3rd row to see mama mia and our necks hurt so much in the end.     i'd try to see if you can get better tickets|`|et19Kxclaa	whoa scary. the lights and noises were loud and flashy and startling and i was in the way back....|`|tM6xoexWaa	I sat 2nd row for Miss Saigon in Chicago, and I thought it was too close.  You can see them spitting.  Phantom of the opera is great about midway back on the floor level.  The chandelier is right above you - ack!    You will probably enjoy yourself no matter what and it will be neat to see it from a different eye's view.  You might get to see the realness of it (people moving on stage, spit, sweaty business, where mics are placed).    Hope you have a good time.

Ste5ZSk5aa	Yes.Yes Read it. The book is like cleaning a cut and sewing up there relationship. Bella and Edward get married and go on a honeymoon together. There at The island he takes her to he grants her wishes to have sex with him. After they have sex like 5 times bella realizes that she is pregnant. Then they go back to Carlise to get more important information. She goes through with the pregnancy and has a baby girl named Reneesme( Renee and Esme put together). She is dying now because the baby riped out of her stomach and she is bleeding to death. Edward ejects her with a needle full of his venom. She gets turned into a vampire and then the Voltori comes after Reneesme because they think she is an immortal child. The Voltori leave after figuring out that the baby is not immortal just half vampire- half human.|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	its about bella getting pregnant basically    and a bunch of other stuff, but mostly that|`|0aEYjVzMaa	obviously, it's about bella and edward  oh wow, that was hard to figure out  dude, just read it and don't be like so many other people who have to have a million reviews and recommendations before they even look at a book|`|Jjx90cCQaa	Duh you should read it only if you read the other first 3 books, which are amazing.|`|OnNJoKdlaa	I read it, and loved it! It's about Bella being pregnant, and then Bella and Renesmee, and of course it's one of those happily-ever-after stories. so yeah, Edward, Bella, and Renesmee together forever the vampire(and half-human half-vampire) family|`|X7GrfPjKaa	Okay. This is a serious spoiler:  - Edward and Bella marry  - On their honeymoon, Bella realizes that she has fallen pregnant  - Her pregnancy develops at an alarmingly fast speed; she cannot cope with her growing baby and falls seriously ill, looking emaciated  - She is basically dead by the time she goes into labour. Her spine snaps, the baby crushes her from inside and vessels pop in her eyeballs...  You'll have to read the rest. Breaking Dawn is by far the best book in the series.|`|CCN2PneTaa	Although I've only read an extract, I know a bit about the book. In Breaking Dawn, Bella has a daughter called Reneesme( the name is a merge of both their mothers' names), who is born with a power. I also suspect Bella will be in some kind of danger again, like she always is, perhaps involving the Volturi. Jacob Black has disappeared, run away because of Bella's rejection. I guess Bella and Edward also marry and maybe, just maybe, Edward might actually get round to changing Bella.|`|o9DNnXD9aa	Breaking Dawn is basically continuing with Edward and Bella's story, with a new issue that they must face. Its a really good book (my favourite in the series along side Twilight itself)  I would strongly recomend it  and if you have read the previous books and enjoyed them then you should DEFINITELY read Breaking Dawn    L x|`|NwsLLZjPaa	It's about (once again) bella and edwards love and how desperately they are fighting for their love when bella gets pregnant. Her baby is a vampire and starts to slowly kill bella from the inside. Edward wishes she would get rid of her baby as it probably will kill her but she refuses and wants to keep it. When her baby is born see if Bella dies. Great book!
y8bFwXZEaa	"Qualities" is undefined. If you mean the character and integrity a person is capable of owning, it is his/her own SELF nurturing that makes the biggest difference.<br>  <br>  This is an odd concept, but basically what I mean is: We create ourselves from that which is given to us. Nature and nurture each give us the material to work from, but neither must determine which is to be more important. Even determinists will tell you man has choices; but he will tell you the choices are from among what nature and nurture have given him.<br>  <br>  Self nurturing is the care a man or woman gives to his/her own mind, which leads to character and integrity. Nature cannot provide that at all. Nurturing may, but in most cases in modern western culture, nurturing has failed. That is why everyone asks why is our culture failing?<br>  <br>  Self nurturing determines the important qualities, to the degree that one spends on growing his/her mind.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...nature...a good demeanor wins more with a smile and a thank you...|`|az2ZBy3iaa	I like to think nurture unless you have a birth defect, in which case nature.<br>  <br>  Seriously, if a kid is born missing half of his brain, he's never gonna make it as a particle physicist.

n7rfbfGmaa	Any books by Liz retting.  My desperate Love diary  My now or never Diary   These two books are hilarious. I read them, and i've also read Diary of a crush, but I preferred these!   Also, Jumping to confusions by Liz Retting.  Any thing by Sarah Dessin is good too.  Hope I help :D|`|0Omv5uFfaa	I loved that series, i honestly must have read them about 50 times. I think that any books that are published by BITE are really good for teenagers but my favourites are by an author called Sara Dessen, she writes books such as This Lullaby and The Truth About Forever. Or you could try the Shopaholic series by Sophie Kinsella, they are just really light-hearted and funny. Hope this is of some help to you|`|MNY5gMGBaa	Well, yes but it is more Teenagerish. Its called the "Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging" series and it consists if around 8 books. They are cheap on Ebay, and are like the book in many ways.   Hope this Helped.
f2cQrG7jaa	It's true in the sense that nothing objective exists in our subjective world. It's not that the rock exists only in our minds, but rather that the rock is located and experienced in our reality. Reality IS subjective. Actuality is something different altogether. Reality is the hologram in which we live out our daily lives. A hologram is necessary in order to create space and time.    We can only feel, see, smell etc using the hologram. Anything that is not projected in the hologram is not experienceable and nothing to us. The hologram is "me". The "me" is this 3d fractal program stemming from your intent.     Quantum physics is off base in a lot of ways, but they are right that we live in a projected reality. They are wrong about dark matter, about acausality, about randomness and more.|`|yOK32PM9aa	No, it is not a disproof.  Berkeley's idealism held that there is no underlying material substrate in which sensations inhere.  Dr. Johnson gave himself a painful sensation in his foot, and maybe even heard the crunch of breaking toe, but these are still sensations.  To disprove Berkeley, he would have to show that there was a material object there independent of anyone's perceptions of it.  What he does prove, however, is not to take philosophy too seriously.  It is still just a rock, capable of breaking our foot, whatever fancy theories we spin around it!|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	He refutes it by making it look ridiculous and stupid, but he does not disprove it.  You can't disprove it any more than you can disprove that a magical invisible dragon that no one can see lives in your basement, but you can certainly show that it is a ridiculous and stupid idea.

wEEOvu5Waa	God, Harry Potter owns Twilight in every aspect. HP actually has a -plot- compared to Twilight which is just mindless drama and fake romance.<br>  <br>  HP actually has character depth, and they are more believable. She also made a school of witchcraft believable, unlike with Meyer who totally ruined the image of a Vampire. I mean really, a vampire who sparkles in the sun, and can sire children? I wont even go into the problems with that, like the fact that a Vampire is a dead body...so how does it father children? O_o<br>  <br>  Its sad that people actually think Twilight could hold a candle to HP. But then again, Twilight is a realllyyyyy easy book to read, so more people will read that rather than challenge their brains with something actually worth while.<br>  <br>  Rowling needs to come out and beat some ***.|`|ex5hVYKxaa	Twilight! =)|`|Xpd9v2lvaa	Harry Potter is popular with a much greater fan base, of all ages. Twilight seems to only appeal with teenage and preteen girls, which a acquit to the fact the the author writes like a teenage or preteen girl.|`|cHxaWW0taa	Harry Potter is more popular- It's liked by a wider audience.

Harry Potter has a broader fan base stretching both genders and many age groups. <br>  <br>  The cultural impact of HP is also more prominent.  Words from the books have made it into common language for English and other language causing  the Oxford English Dictionary to add this definition to its pages<br>  Muggle, n.4<br>  [< MUG n.6 + -LE suffix 1, invented by J. K. (Joanne Kathleen) Rowling (b. 1965), British author of children's fantasy fiction (see quot. 1997 at main sense).] <br>      In the fiction of J. K. Rowling: a person who possesses no magical powers. Hence in allusive and extended uses: a person who lacks a particular skill or skills, or who is regarded as inferior in some way. <br>  <br>  Here's the stats to back my claim up<br>  <br>  Currently Harry Potter series and books from the World of Harry Potter have sold over 400 million copies.  Twilight is only at 42 million that's 2 million less than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows on its own.<br>  <br>  Twilight currently holds the number one seat for children's series and Harry Potter holds fourth. Twilight held the number one post for most of 2008, however, Twilight only took one over half a year after the final Harry Potter.  Twilight has been on the list for 79, impressive except HP has been on it for 207 weeks.<br>  <br>  Twilight has some recognition in the movie department.  The online advanced ticket sales for the movie have only been beat by Star Wars Episode III and Dark Knight.  It grossed $35.7 million dollars on opening day.  It has so far grossed about $360 million in ticket sales.  That being said the first five Harry Potter movies have grossed over $4.48 billion in worldwide receipts.  Both francises have 3 more films to go.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	I think they're neck in neck, but only because Twilight hit the movie theatre. If it hadn't, the movie fan base would be much less since it's a pre-teen/teenager's collection. <br>  <br>  Harry Potter on the other hand is something that started off when you were a child, so many, many people kept up with the stories through out the years. <br>  <br>  I can see HP going onto the "Classics" bookshelf next to Lord of the Rings, Dune, and The Chronicles of Narnia. Twilight will just lose the interest.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Harry Potter seems to be so much better thought out. There is so much that happens and then so much that relies on things that happened earlier and it seems to be planned a lot better. I also like the third person approach more than Twilight's first person narrative. It gave more perspective as to what was happening.<br>  <br>  But they were just so different. One was a romance and the other an adventure. <br>  I liked Harry Potter more.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Potter.

Since i'm a teenager i'm telling you what i think and what a lot of my friends think, TWILIGHT is more of a top favorite because it's newer and its like a romance about vampires and humans. HARRY POTTER is really old so it's not as hip to teen but it's a classic so many kids still read them.|`|eT3vedhoaa	I never thought there would come a day where i would say that there was a better book than Harry Potter, but then I read Twilight!

2z1h5mfOaa	You need to learn about the way colours are created, i.e. what are primary colours and what colours are made if you mix them (secondary colours).    Purple is a mix of blue and red, but it could have brown in it too, which is a mix of red and green.  You really need to find out for yourself what colours do when mixed.  Just try it out on a piece of paper and then decide what colour fits in what you do...|`|jaAolejUaa	dark and lime green, black, brown
hQ95u9OLaa	Thinking back over all the books of his that I've read, and it's been a few, I can't remember any completely happy endings. The side of good almost always wins but at great cost. And you can go right down the line. The Shining lets Danny and Wendy live but Jack dies. Ben and Mark escape Barlow in Salem's Lot but Ben's girlfriend doesn't make it, and the town becomes a ghost town. Charlie survives Firestarter and kicks butt, but loses her parents. This happens in almost all of his books. This is why I like him. He is more adult than other horror writers. Evil is always a very strong force but it is almost always overcome. There are books like Pet Cemetery and Thinner where evil wins.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	It depends on your perspective, but:    Rose Madder  The Stand  (The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was one of my favs!)    For consistently happy endings, you could try reading Dean Koontz.  His are similar in content ot King to an extent, and usually have happy endings.
Iw6vqJd8aa	The German people were going through a great economic crisis worse then what we are now. It would take a wheel barrow full of thousand mark notes to buy a loaf of bread. Then Hitler came along and promised a better life. He was charismatic and a powerful speaker, the people wanted and needed something to believe in. With his charisma, he promised the German people better living conditions and more money and a pure German nation. He gave them some one to blame their problems on, the jews and anyone that wasn't a "pure" German.    For the same reasons at first then people became a Nazi for protection and to prove they were a good and loyal German.|`|VSWl45cKaa	The answer is greater than can be described here. You should read the material here to get a good overview of Hitler and why, in the post-World War I era he was able to take power, start WW II and last until he killed himself in 1945.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler|`|bxlYleZkaa	They were looking for a powerful leader and Adolf Hitler fitted the bill!|`|J9fxTGwKaa	The Germans didn't know what to believe, they would believe any explanation.

Are you a German now? Good...Then read this - under the Treaty of Versailles (officially ending World War I), Germany was forced to cede substantial territories, including Alsace-Lorraine. West Prussia was given to Poland, and the Polish "corridor to the sea" was created. The Saar, a coal-rich territory, was put under French control for 15 years, and the Rhineland was to be occupied by the Allies for 15 years and then permanently demilitarized. Germany was to maintain an army no larger than 100,000 men, with no air force, and a navy of 6 ships. Germany was also forced to pay reparations of 20 billion marks.|`|xFixySnKaa	As said above, it's a long story.  But basically we took vengeance on them after WWI with reparations they could not afford.  We know now to look after the defeated people as the Americans later did with the Japs.  The fascists and the communists offerred salvation to a desperate population.  There were fights and riots between the left and the right.  In desperation the people believed they extremists were their only salvation and a type of mass hysteria took place.  Don't think it couldn't happen again.  The extremists are begining to appear with their speeches at strikes up north (UK) even now,
UIT1khqtaa	no, she halted the writing.  guys, did u ever visit her official website for recent news??    this is what she has to say:  So where does this leave Midnight Sun? My first feeling was that there was no way to continue. Writing isn't like math; in math, two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like. With writing, the way you feel changes everything. If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely.    I'd rather my fans not read this version of Midnight Sun. It was only an incomplete draft; the writing is messy and flawed and full of mistakes. But how do I comment on this violation without driving more people to look for the illegal posting? It has taken me a while to decide how and if I could respond. But to end the confusion, I've decided to make the draft available here (at the end of this post). This way, my readers don't have to feel they have to make a sacrifice to stay honest. I hope this fragment gives you further insight into Edward's head and adds a new dimension to the Twilight story. That's what inspired me to write it in the first place.    I do want to take a moment and thank the wonderful fans who have been so supportive of me over the past three years. I cannot begin to tell you how much each of you means to me. I only hope this note will stop all the confusion and online speculation so that the Twilight universe can once again become the happy escape it used to be. After this incredibly busy year, I am now focusing on spending more time with my family and working on some other writing projects.    http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsu...|`|NwsLLZjPaa	i heard due to protest of fans all over the country stephine meyer has finally agreed to continue with midnight sun.

Meyer is a big baby and is too 'depressed' to continue writing it right now because she idiotically gave it to someone she 'trusted' and it got leaked. And she can't write it because then she would have James kill everyone, which makes no sense because Twilight is already written! She just needs to write it from Eddie's POV. It is on hold until she feels all happy and fuzzy inside again.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	Someone got a copy of it and leaked it out on the internet. It says on her website that she's on writers block.

This question is repeated a lot.|`|rzDbR1Yiaa	from what i've read on her website...

You could try Mr. Mills at kirkseydatabase@aol.com    Also, it helps sometimes if you specify race as there are often so many people by the same name during the same time period and place.

uhHfm3Azaa	you could look at the contrast between the earnshaws and the lintons.    but im not completely sure it is.  depending on which characters you look at it through.  cathy and heathcliff look at each other as their home (not wuthering heights, even- just each other)  and cathy was unhappy at thrushcross grange (even if she was lying to herself sometimes)

Theres two girls, sisters I believe and an old drinking well. One sister goes to the well, and theres an old lady there, she(old lady) asks the younger girl to get some water out of the well for her, the younger girl does this, and the old lady(the witch really), gives her the gift of having jewels and riches come out of her mouth when she speaks. When she goes home, her mother sees this, and sends her other daughter to he well, hoping this will happen to her to, and theyll be rich. But this daughter refuses when the old lady asks her to get her some water and the old lady who is the witch curses her by making her have toads and frogs jump out of her mouth when she talks.

Kn90YAzYaa	Because in the book, he's just plain goofy and has no idea what he's really doing.  He's just living out a fantasy.  Imagine Leslie Nielson (Naked Gun movies) in story form as Don Quixote.  That pretty much sums it up.|`|TYzNTT7caa	Like the main characters in stories of knights and crusaders in search of a grail and waylaid by women (Lancelot, e. g.), Don Quixote is on a quest, but he's mad, the one thing religious seekers are supposed not to be.
og6VLIrraa	Look at the possibility of doing an extract from "A Servant of Two Masters" by Carlo Goldoni. Look it up on the web and for a five minute sketch you may be able to get an extract free. The play is out of copyright, but technically translators also have copyright so you may not be able to get the entire text free.  Garry G's advice is also well worth following, so track down some Commedia scenarios and improvise them.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	You're asking for a scripted instance of an improvised art form?    Did you really think that through?  Look into Commedia, choose your character (for those not familiar with Commedia, there are stock characters) choose a scenario, and just do it.

LVZdzPmpaa	If you are in the U.S., your work is copyrighted as it is created. You don't need to do anything special, file any sort of paperwork or pay any fees to anybody. (A publisher will further advance the copyright protection per the agreement that is signed with the author. This is something very far down the road that you don't need to worry about.)    Once a book is written and edited and ready to publish, it can take over a year to get it to the shelf. There are a number of factors involved, including the publisher, the genre, the audience, the cover price, the marketing plan (if there is one), etc. Some books are purchases for publication and then killed before they are actually printed. It is possible for a title to be slated for publication and then get bumped by a more promising entry.    You do not send a manuscript to anyone until they ask for it. You do not say if you are writing fiction or non-fiction; there are different conventions for each.     A publisher decides if a book will enter the market as a hardcover, a soft cover (trade paper) or a paperback. There are three distinct types, not two.    Elsevier publishes (non-fiction) health and science titles as well as a variety of journals. I assume therefore that you are writing a non-fiction, health/science related title. Elsevier requires representation. Any agent will know that Elsevier also expects its authors to be noted authorities in the specific field.     Given the nature of your post, it would seem that you are a novice. If you hope to publish, you must do the research regarding publishing, which is a complex and often nasty business.     Keep in mind, too, that in publishing the publisher takes all the risk. Therefore, the publisher holds all the cards.     In the meantime, until you have a completed, polished manuscript, focus your energy and time on the writing. Publishing is at this time the very least of your worries.    If you have other questions, email me.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Serious answers only? And you're in the initial phase of writing?    Come back when you've written, edited and polished your finished book. Then you will be ready for serious answers.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Don't even think about publishing until your novel is done and edited a million times to perfection.    Publishers will NOT accept unsolicited manuscripts, especially from an unestablished writer.    Research and query a literary agent to represent you.  IF they are interested in your work, they may contact you.    Many, many skilled writers have waited years (if at all) to get published.    Don't hold your breath.|`|HiIp6jcyaa	It really depends on the market. I say apprx. a year. It can be more and it can be less (just don't expect 2 weeks.)  My advice is go through an agency and they will help you deal with all the important matters like copyright and covers. An agency that I really like is called Writer's Literary Agency and Marketing Company. E-mail me if you have any more questions. Best of luck. From author to author. ;p|`|aXEBolkJaa	go to blurb.com  you can download their free software and publish a book for as little as $4.95  it takes about 7-10 business days to get your book\  ALSO you can sell it for whatever price you choose  They will send you the difference every time someone buys your book  CHECK IT OUT!!!!|`|RzbRRUOdaa	You may opt to self-publish and here's the scenario:    (1) When you finish writing, your book could be published within 5 weeks, depending on your needs. If it's more complicated, it takes more time like 2 to 5 months.    (2) Self-publishing companies like Xlibris does copyrighting services for book authors. http://www2.xlibris.com/add-on.html    (3) You have full control of your book from cover to cover when you self-publish.  This means both form and substance.    I hope you find this information useful but the very first thing you need to do is to really finish the book that you are writing.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	It depends if you keep the copyright's or not some will keep the copyright some will want you to do it. You have to find a publisher and look what they have for a criteria.      If your going through a legit Publishing company they ask for the manuscript, Most do it through emails these days. They will sent it to their editors .  Then you have to review all the changes made.. Then you send it back.. it can take weeks.. Also you can choose what you want on a cover.. The editors will get involved in that as well..     However if you have a publishing company they will answer these questions.

4fa8d2d33ede43ef5d60899072cad809aa	A good lead guitarist should lay down a good counter melody to the singer (in a rock band). You don't focus on establishing a rhythm as that is the job of the rhythm guitarist (obviously). You need to learn lots of scales: Major, Minor, Pentatonic, etc. Learn about all the modes and be able to play all of your scales up and down the neck. Learn arpeggios and basically anything that you can fall back to when improvising. Lots of lead guitar can be improvised, and of course you need to be able to solo (that's what all these scales are for). You should also be coming up with riffs that make songs so memorable(Listen to Black Dog by Led Zeppelin). Hope this helps you get started.    Great examples of Lead greats: Jimmy Page, Pete Townsend, Brian May, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton.

Also, notice some of the gods are women.<br>  <br>  While our hero is delayed sailing home from war, his wife’s faithfulness is a beacon of steadfast devotion. On the other hand, Odysseus himself engages in multiple affairs before returning to his wife. Because of the cultural double-standard, the Odyssey doesn’t condemn its hero for doing so. This raises interesting questions of different types of loyalty: one of Odysseus’s justification for cheating on his wife is that he never "in his heart" gave consent.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/The Odyssey

How about Acceleration? It was more of a mystery novel, but was absolutely awesome!|`|XCMrl2D1aa	I highly recommend reading the Shadow Children series by Margret Peterson Haddix.They are my all time favorite so far.<br>  <br>  It is about these illegal 3rd children in hiding. They can never be seen or they will be killed. The main character Luke, has to go undercover and finds out all these secrets and gets nearly killed. Very action packed edge of your seat book. But the last one-Among the Free, holds a very valuable lesson. <br>  <br>  There is this other series that kept my brother reading all the time (he hates to read sometimes) was Chasing Yesterday. This girl wakes up and has no memory of her past. She tries to piece together all she knows but is left with lies. She gets these haunting visions about this man controlling her and making her destroy things. I don't want to give away the ending but she does have powers that she uncovers. Like the Shadow Children, this series is exciting to the very end and gives your nails a messy manicure! Mine disappeared by the time I finished it!<br>  <br>  There is this other series called THE MISSING also by Haddix and it is about this boy who finds out that he is part of some FBI secret. He sees people appearing a disappearing ad everyone around his town-including him-is adopted. He finds out something that is linked history and TIME TRAVEL. It isn't one of those predictable books were the kid gets locked in time and has to escape. This one is about uncovering his mysterious past and finding out where he really belongs. Only two books are out. Actually one-FOUND but the next one SENT is coming out in August.<br>  <br>  <br>  These series are among my favorite!<br>  <br>  Also here are a few which I am not gonna get into detail.<br>  <br>  Percy Jackson and the Olympians-Lightning Thief<br>  Kidnapped (Gorden Korman)-3 books<br>  Inkheart<br>  Uglies<br>  Chasing Vermeer Series (3 books)<br>  And the Classics like Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys. You can never get enough of those!<br>  <br>  I also am an avid reader finishing 2-3 books per DAY. I agree! It feels like there is no more!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

VHa5PIfpaa	finger picking patterns...  start learning to do a three finger three fret scale using a two fingered picking pattern.  REALLY hard to get down.<br>  <br>  Slap:  Venture just far enough into the Funk genre to pick up some PHAT slap bass techniques.<br>  <br>  Advanced songs for bass:   Most of the ones I know of are all Chilli Pepper songs like "Higher Ground".  Also try and get the guitar lick from "Play That Funky Music" by Wild Cherry down... in the recording, it's played on a guitar, but if you can slap a bass to that tune... especially the WHOLE SONG... you're well on your way.<br>  <br>  Start listening to Dave Matthew' stuff... some of that is pretty wild stuff to try and play.<br>  <br>  NEVER Underestimate the scales.... especially the blues scales... they are INVALUABLE improv tools.... if you ever get a solo and don't know whqat to play, all you need is a blues scale in the key the song is written in... EVERY NOTE IN THAT SCALE will be in key with the song no matter which chord change you are playing.
M0bE2IBQaa	The book was fantastic. The way Jodi Picoult writes and how she develops her characters is great. She's a great writer and those are rare to find. I sort of was guessing the ending because in the beginning, there was that little exerpt about one sister trying to kill the other sister when she's small and I sort of had a feeling it was Kate trying to get rid of Anna when Anna was born. It was just something that Kate might do because she was tired of living and she saw Anna as her lifeline and she was tired of it. But overall, it still made me cry. <br>  <br>  I've heard that this book is being made into a movie. It'll release sometime this year in June. I'm trying to keep an open mind about this movie.|`|DjCLWseZaa	The ending was very clever, very unexpected, and utterly sad. I cried , but I wouldn't have changed it.|`|O1tQ9nMVaa	I love that book!!!!! To me, both the ending and beginning are very important factors in deciding whether a book is good or not. Personally at first I thought that the ending sucked, but the more I thought about it and how I would end that book, the more I liked the ending. Now, I think there was no other better way to end a book like that, in my opinion. But, yes, it was very unexpected.|`|Td8yQTuBaa	The ending was sad, but it was done really well. It was definitely an unexpected twist, but it made the book that much better. I wouldn't change it...

s7VCRYofaa	I believe love is definitely a fundamental in life.  However, there are many different ways to embrace and experience love.  You can develop a love for a hobby, sport, club, family member or friend.  The best way to meet someone of the opposite sex that could become a boyfriend/girlfriend is to hangout in places where others of similar interest are.  If you like coffee and conversing about politics, religion, or the most recent news then hang out in a coffee shop.  If you like flirting and hearing pickup lines, dancing and loud music hangout in a club or bar.  This way you are prepared because you have similar interests to the ones you will be around.|`|aAKBPqSIaa	everyone yearns for love, it is a natural human instinct, is it not after all what makes us human? Maybe you are rejecting this idea to protect yourself because you believe nobody will love you? It doesn't really sound like you are ready for a relationship yet but not letting people in will only make life more difficult. We need to discuss how we feel in order to understand and make sense of our emotions, however complicated they may be. Does not the fact that you ar questioning it show you that perhaps love is what you do want? Im not saying you have to go seek it, but open the door so that it might come to you.|`|NvwVmiaZaa	it's nice, but it's not what life is all about. give it a shot, if it works for you, then it works. if it doesn't, you'll of tried and you'll know more about it. then you can decide if it is what life is all about.|`|DKuly5cBaa	hey go out there and start to have real fun|`|qJXSTtTfaa	Life is how you want to live.

It has many other manifestations that are just as important as sexual love or even considerably more in some cases.

True, some people cant handle books like that because it could be controversial to them, or they just might not want to face the reality of the fact that that kind of stuff does happen. Some might not be able to handle it because it might hit to close to home.<br>  <br>  However, the way I see it, is you judge a book not only by its content such as the plot, but how well it is written. Ive read books about transsexuals, gays, murders, sex victims, everything.

Readers read to experience things that they never have before, and some people might not know what it's like to be abused. The fact that the main character is strong minded would make it even more appealing. People read books about girls who are self destructive or have been raped. Why not read about a strong girl who is abused? The romance would make it even better because, admit it or not, girls love books with a romantic twist.|`|tISJYHJNaa	It sounds like a kind of book that can happen to someone and i would <3 to read it! many young readers might not like it but if it was for young adults, I, personally, would love it.|`|IOVDAwmnaa	write what you LIKE to write about. it'll be better that way. :)<br>  i think it sounds perfectly fine. i would read it.|`|UExvkezPaa	sounds interesting|`|Yq4ekVD9aa	probably. i love reading|`|KrFQ1gcraa	I'd read it.|`|U2VF8cqNaa	sure sound good, have this happen to you|`|cJQdhGYJaa	i would read it|`|Co7BtKiPaa	i would totally read that.<br>  sounds interesting in a weird kinda way/|`|fPL7Ftjtaa	hell yes write it
KBBonf97aa	Contact a local theater and inquire about acting lessons.  Many theaters offer lessons taught by their own actors and that's a great place to test the waters.  Also, if you volunteer with the theater while you're taking classes, you'll learn everything that goes into staging a production.  And since you'll be known to the theater regulars, that will work to your advantage when there are auditions.  Many kids are only interested in becoming stars, but if you're regularly helping out around the theater, the people there will know you're serious and dedicated.  And once you've appeared in a couple productions, you'll have the resume you need to shop for an agent.<br>  <br>  Many TV shows and movies film on location and contact local theaters when they need actors to fill extra and supporting roles, so being involved locally will enable you to find out about opportunities not made known to the public.  And most stage actors also work in commercials and film, so your peers will be valuable resources.  Not only will you learn about the craft of acting from them, but you'll find out about other opportunities.<br>  <br>  Most people you see on television or in movies started in theaters, since it's the best place to master the craft, network and gain the experience you'll need to build a career.  Acting is a passion, so don't worry about becoming an A-lister.  There are plenty of fantastic working actors whose names you wouldn't recognize, but who make a living doing something they love and at which they excel.  And even the A-listers make time in their schedules to return to theater, since it helps them keep their chops fresh.  Theater is both the starting point and home base for most actors.  Good luck!|`|fnMlgExbaa	Try out in your school play. see your audiences reaction. ask your friends or some random people, were you good? what can you do to improve your performance?<br>  then you can find a local talent agent to get you local acting gigs.. beware of the agents that ask you to pay up front. Soon, you might be hooked up with bigger auditions and if you get a part...<br>  hell, who knows, you might just get somewhere.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|e2wjcKgGaa	Well  if I were you, I wouldn't do it. yes, you have a good speaking voice. Congrats, I would look into public speaking. However, the likelihood of you being on stage or in a movie is slim to none. People have been acting and receiving performing arts training their whole lives. I'm not saying you can't do it, but it is a very tough Business. I actually love acting and the performing arts more than anything (well besides my family) and I am very seriously debating whether I should pursue it because it is so tough. However, if you put your mind to it, you do have a chance. Good luck!|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	don't doubt yourself, and don't let the negativity of others cloud your decision.<br>  <br>  if you decide to be an actor, go for it, but you have to be 100% sure that it's what you want. it takes a long time to get to a place where a profession as acting is also financially stable.|`|15a781a97ff5a5a5c3b8cb8d0530d63caa	Well, it;s her opinion.

R5UIMBvcaa	For an epic, Beowulf is pretty short, and I think you'll like it.  I haven't seen the movie, but I hear it makes some changes.  In the original, Grendel's mother is no sexpot, just a female troll.  Sparknotes (or Cliff Notes if you're into hard copy) will probably help, but if you'll just read the poem itself, you may not need them.  As you read, just look for these two themes: conflict of good and evil, with the monsters representing the evil in human nature, and transitoriness--impermanence.  Nothing described in the poem, especially nothing human, lasts.|`|JN6LWA6Oaa	I saw the movie, it was....lame.....|`|HSIi8qOWaa	If you want to understand the basic plotline, the movie will help. However when reading Beowulf the difficulty lies in understanding the language. Make sure you get the bilingual version of the text. I read it in one of my lower division English courses, and we covered it in about 3 class periods. All in all, reading it from beginning to end, if you're a good reader, should take about 3-5 hours. The range is there just due to the language, and any background information you may need on key words in the text (like information in the footnotes). Have fun with this! It's a manly man's poem!

SuLMCvVfaa	I like the alliteration in the beginning.<br>  <br>  Are there stanzas?
XxILKutWaa	All of them!<br>  <br>  It depends on what part of the turn you're having problems with. Keep these tips in mind, though:<br>  <br>  -Arms are never lax--always strong! Whatever position your arms are in (fifth, first, etc.) when you turn someone should be able to press down on them and feel strong resistance. Make sure you aren't "winding up" for your turn, thus throwing yourself off balance. Strong arms! A good exercise for this is to simply put your arms in first position, then have someone press on them. Push back so that your arms do not move. That is the feeling you should have in your turns--arms and back connected and strong!<br>  <br>  -Core core CORE! Make sure you're using (ACTIVELY) your core muscles. They keep your spine and pelvis aligned, thus allowing you to get fully around and land gracefully. If you aren't sure you're properly engaging your core, try some pilates based core work. Lie on the floor on your back. Naturally. Where's your spine? Is it arched a little off the floor? Then use your AB muscles to "imprint" your spine to the floor. Use those abs to bring every spinal vertebra touching the floor. This is the feeling you should have during the turn. Core engaged, pelvis straight up and down--never tilted--and spine straight. (Neither arched nor curved!)<br>  <br>  -Are you spotting properly? Keep in mind that turns a la seconde tend to be slower than standard pirouettes and pique turns. As such, your spot factors in even more. Rather than spotting very sharply, spot with your speed adjusted to the altered speed of your turn. If the turn is slow, spot slow! Otherwise your body and head will be turning at different speeds, thus again throwing you off balance. <br>  <br>  -Finally, go back to basics! Make sure your developpe a la seconde is perfectly aligned and strong. Then try a VERY sustained grande battement a la seconde (at 90 degrees). Once you have been able to cleanly, clearly, and strongly reach a 90 degree grande battement a la seconde, you'll have a better sense of how to get straight to that position for your turn.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yDB2EUbDaa	the same ones you use when you lift your leg in second i don't know what they are called but it's  the upper side of your thigh and i guess partly your inner thigh...

Ua5Y9PeDaa	Shipping was essential. the trade winds made it necessary for all ships to sail north along the coast of America to catch the eastward winds. All shipping depended on these winds to travel to England and from England they had to sail south to catch the west bound winds to the Americas then sail north along the coast to their destination. They couldn't sail directly against the wind.<br>  <br>  This was the hay-day of trade and shipping and the clipper and Bristol ships.

F# is first three fingers and right middle finger key. When you play this you will notice that the sharp is a half step higher than the F natural.<br>  <br>  Flats are the exact opposite, flats are half step lower than the natural.

bIouq64Oaa	I think that Stephenie Meyer did a good job of creating a realistic character, who has her faults just like anyone else. In books a lot of the time, I find that characters are just too perfect, and that ruins it for me. I believe we are used to reading about these perfect characters and we enjoy being in a world where people do everything correctly, which we cannot attain. Since Bella Swan does not fit that category, we dislike her.<br>  <br>  I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with anyone here, I'm just stating my thoughts, so please don't hate me! (wince)|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	I don't hate her, she's just sort of annoying. Always moping around. And, after all the complaining she does about how Edward is wayy too good for her (I agree), she goes and has feelings for Jacob? At least book Bella had her quirky/humorous side. Move Bella is straight up depressing.|`|XMjdZBmmaa	My husband and I both read the Twilight series. He thought Bella was a drama queen. She just really annoyed me.

Her personality is crap.|`|ZfWUK5x3aa	No, you're not, I dislike Bella Swan too. Her character is just very plain, boring, and unlikeable. It is a different form of dislike than one for a villain, but villains ARE more interesting than bella! Seriously, she is very monotone!|`|62ihLEDIaa	I know what you mean. edword this and edword that. its pathetic. i wish people would just shut up about twilight.|`|i0rKPYLJaa	No. She's clingy and annoying.|`|VuGMOf4Caa	Of course not, join the club!<br>  Shes a whiney, spoilt, un-deserving ***** who should've died|`|cxip3nA8aa	Dude, I think Isabella Swan should go jump off a cliff.

OHfZFR31aa	If you are over 25, you need to look for modeling agencies that have what's called a "Classics" division, which is for mature models. "Mature" in the modeling world is basically anyone over 23 years old.<br>  <br>  Ford has the most established Classics division, as well as Wilhemina's S Women division - both cater to models of all ages<br>  <br>  As for talent agencies, you can't get an agent if you don't already have a lot of acting experience. A friend who has been in off-Broadway plays and was even mentioned in a review in the NY Times still can't get an agent because she hasn't done enough work.

BBfIXcI0aa	A Professor in my theatre department once said, "If you truly feel nothing at all going out on stage, you're probably a sociopath." You can't get rid of stage fright - it's healthy and normal, and when channeled properly, it will help you make your performance shine. Stage fright stems from worrying about what people are thinking when they're watching you, or worrying about how you'll do. The only way to "get rid" of those thoughts is to transfer the fear into nervous energy, and replace them with your performance. If you're really tuned in, and really in the moment, and really BECOMING that character, then you're going to be too busy "living your life" to worry about what the people watching it happen to be thinking.|`|S01zIagOaa	Breath. Don't think about the audience, focus on you and the other actors around you.|`|oa3VMgcWaa	I'm not sure why you'd want to get rid of it.  I always call it stage energy.  Just embrace the excitement of the moment and realize that's what stage fright is... excitement.  Be as well prepared as you can possibly be and then just enjoy the thrill.|`|r6iXAY6Saa	if you become more comfortable with your fellow actors, you'll become more comfortable on stage. also, have confidence in yourself!
eFnUBBxiaa	India 6th b.c. was lots of wars, and a rigid caste system. Kingly dad wanted Buddha to stay and succeed him in waging wars. Dad was certain that his nation would fall without a successor. But the historical Buddha was unhappy with this lot in life, so he did some soul-searching.<br>  <br>  Hinduism is an umbrella term for many different faiths that encompass many different Gods in India. The Buddha grew up in this and took some ideas from them, such as karma and samsara (rebirth/reincarnation). But he hated the heavy rituals (of Hinduism at that specific moment in time) that only served to justify a king's power. <br>  <br>  There were a group of ascetic monks who completely rejected this ritual, and the Buddha studied under them. They placed heavy emphasis on self-sacrifice (meditation, fasting, chanting). They would put themselves through harsh mental and physical trials for days. The Buddha learned from them too, but he soon grew dissatisfied with how extreme these monks were in their rejection of material. After all, the world is composed of material, so it is like the monks rejected the world itself.<br>  <br>  The Buddha proposed a middle path that would neither covet material (the Hindu priests of his time) nor reject material (the monks), because the material is not the source of the problem. Gold is just gold, and gold will be gold with or without humans to covet or reject it. It is our relationship to material that is problematic. When we want gold too much, we suffer. When we pretend like we don't want gold at all, we also suffer. We only stop suffering when we realize that gold is pretty nice, but it's not worth doing bad things to ourselves and others to get it. And gold won't create happiness, because its just a hunk of metal. In fact, gold won't do much of anything. Our minds, on the other hand, do all sorts of things (telling you to value gold as something great). But if we accept things the way they are (regardless of how much or little gold we have), if we can quiet our minds, then we can create our own happiness apart from the hunk of gold. <br>  <br>  We need not depend on or destroy the material world. Just as a hunk of gold can only be a hunk of gold, so can the world only be the world. This was one of the Buddha's messages, and it carried a lot of power in a war-torn India. Everyone fought over resources (such as gold) and caused great suffering to many instead of paying attention to what really matters.|`|EZTgCOv4aa	you shouldnt have put homework now ppl wont answer
TQVbiXtFaa	A friend of mine has Dissociative Identity Disorder. That's basically the thing you're looking for. A few things to note: If you want it to be at all realistic, the personalities know nothing of the others other than what they've been told. They may share some memories prior to the development of the disorder. Often the switches, for lack of a better term, happen at random without any trigger, although I've noticed it's happened also when he was in an extreme emotion, and this usually results in a personality that displays that emotion more strongly than others. DID is usually a result of childhood trauma, and is a result of the victim trying unsuccessfully to repress the memories.<br>  <br>  <br>  This will sound very cliched, but the personalities my friend usually expresses are a very, very malicious one (who hates me; unfortunately, he's a rather big fellow), his true self (wow, this sounds so lame in words), and one that's very naive and knows nothing of how humans...err...function (like...he's basically a kid. I think. I don't know? I'm not a psychiatrist!). I THINK he's shown others before, but as I don't see him often, I don't know for sure. He has a service dog whose job is to keep him away from people if it senses he's not right (dogs are very good at this, though why that is, again, I couldn't tell you). He's often rather depressed because he regrets the things we've told him he's done, though it's not his fault. Uhm...what more to say... Oh! Schizophrenia and DID are NOT the same thing. Schizo usually deals with extreme hallucinations and detachment. They are in no way to be confused. Whether or not hallucinations do come into DID, I do not know; he has never mentioned any such thing. He's mentioned very vivid dreams, though. Also, I don't know if your character could really be a ninja, seeing as this disorder also puts a massive strain on the body: my friend is often exhausted, and he complains of pain, though he is in no way out of shape.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's hoping he doesn't find this; he's very sensitive about this.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh! I found a Wikipedia article on the subject that fills in many gaps I left out. I scanned it and realised, yeah, there's a lot I didn't mention. Your character, for instance, might often be confused on the day, though if he has any knowledge of his disorder (there are, I believe, patients with it who are oblivious to it), he'll probably think to ask whenever he realises, hey, I don't remember being here! What day is it?!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociativ...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ...But yeah.

Life is an energy machine that replicates.<br>  <br>  So what money is FOR, is to attract a mate & ensure the survival & procreative success of your offspring.<br>  <br>  It's quite possible to make a lot of money, and have no sense of what to do with it.

But if what we think of as reality really is a dream, then there's no reason to believe that those sorts of things actually do wake you up from a dream.  That could simply be a fiction created by your mind, along with everything else.  Ultimately there probably is no way to know that what you perceive as reality actually exists; that it isn't just a 'dream' of some description.  But believing it's real is a very useful assumption to make.|`|tqWW0GaNaa	Watch the movie Waking Life.<br>  <br>  Descartes thought it was clear you weren't dreaming because in a dream you can consciously change elements of the dream when you realize you're dreaming, and in real life you can't.<br>  <br>  I'm done that in a dream ... realized, and changed what was happening ... lucid dreaming ... so the question is .... can you change any elements of your experience right now?<br>  <br>  If you can, you might be dreaming ... change more elements ... its fun!|`|9d186c2ebefdbde8d0bb36cdaae05407aa	Yes, human life is a dream.

XoDWnklLaa	Sorry to sound negative, but personally I don't think it's worth near what they ask.  Just search Ipop into google and look at all the complaints, specifically the page on Better Bureau Agency.  I attended JRP classes, wish I hadn't spent all that money, and have "WON" the audition to attend IPOP, which is not the "once in a lifetime" thing like they make it out to be, after I made the first audition 4 or 5 years ago I was told that any time in the future that I could get up the money I could attend the event w/o auditioning again, and truthfully I felt the audition I performed for the IPOP thing was my worst to date, however they felt it was "out of this world."  I've also heard that just about all high-level casting directors will automatically scrap you from an audition list if you list JRP or IPOP on your resume, they don't have a good rep w/ the talent world.  Tonight, on a SUNDAY night they called again to see if I could come in to talk about attending IPOP, I wondered why they did this on a Sunday night until I realized it was the night of the Academy Awards, coincidence?<br>  <br>  Also the "participating agencies" that you're required to get training from is just "participating agency" as in JRP ONLY  and don't get your hopes up about IPOP as I did at first too, it seems that they accept anyone willing to pay the $10K|`|NjYCvfYGaa	It explains everything here.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ipopconvention.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipopconvention.com</a><br>  <br>  word for word.<br>  To attend ipop you have to be trained a participating school.<br>  you can read about it at the website

This involvement changed the social status and working lives of women in many countries from that point onwards.<br>  <br>  Women's contribution to both wars was significant; though the attitudes towards their contribution were typically paternalistic<br>  During both World War I and World War II, women were called on, by necessity, to do work and to take on roles that were outside their traditional gender expectations<br>  <br>  In World War I, for example, thousands of women worked in munitions factories (see Canary girl), offices and large hangars used to build aircraft.[1] Women were also involved in knitting socks and preparing hampers for the soldiers on the front, as well as other voluntary work, but as a matter of survival women had to work for paid employment for the sake of their families.<br>  <br>  Nursing became the one and only area of female contribution that involved being at the front and experiencing the war.<br>  Many women worked as volunteers serving at the Red Cross and encouraging the sale of bonds and the planting of "victory gardens".<br>  <br>  In part because of female participation in the war effort Canada, the USA, Great Britain, and a number of European countries extended suffrage to women in the years after the First World War<br>  <br>  Before the war: <br>  Prior to the First World War women's role in society in western countries was generally confined to the domestic sphere (but not necessarily their own home) and to certain types of jobs: 'Women's Work'.
mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

LgKn8Dpdaa	I've been playing Bb clarinet for years, and, at first, the higher notes were hard to master. Make sure your fingers are completely covering the hole and are pressed down firmly on any keys. It's important not to let any air escape. Tone is very important - especially when in a band or orchestra. When playing in the upper register, its important to support yourself and breathe from your diaphragm, as well as tighten up with your lips. Listen to what sound is coming from your instrument and make sure it sounds good. If you sound sharp, pull out a bit. If you're flat, push in. <br>  I actually play on #2 reeds and can play the lowest to the highest note. For me, I find that the thinner the reed, the easier it is to play.<br>  Hope this helps=)|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Those notes are harder to hit. Let me guess when you play it, you get either a completely wrong squeak or an airy sound. All of this can be easily fixed with practice of not puffing your cheeks, tighten the lower lip, blow faster air, and great posture. The higher you go the tight the lip needs to become. DON'T BITE!!!|`|44h8skM6aa	I always thought that I had to tighten my mouth to get the highnotes. However, I recently got to talk to some students from UoP (University of the Pacific) when they came to preform for my school (they're saxophone quartet is amazing by the way!) When I asked about high notes they said that you actually have to lossen up. <br>  <br>  Also, use lots of air.<br>  <br>  I've heard that it helps to go up to a reed 3 1/2, but I still use 3's. My fellow 2nd Clarinets go between 3 and 3 1/2. I don't know what the first clarinets use...<br>  <br>  Also, to get the high notes out, practice long tones. It will annoy the heck out of everyone in your house, but they are beneficial (no matter how boring they are)<br>  <br>  oh, and remember, the high notes are hard to make sound good, it's not just you.|`|exxHakadaa	For the high notes you need to use a lot of air and close your throat a little. To help with your transitioning all you need to is use the fingerings for those notes that your most comfortable with and move between the notes really slowly. That helps a lot. Your reed is hard enough, but you can go up to a 3.5 or 4. Hope this helps.|`|D2St4L5Jaa	I can't know exactly, one tip is to blow fast and straight. Find a target a little above your eye level and pretend like you're blowing toward that. Make sure your tongue is curved.
Ow3O7h4caa	For the diminished chords, you can use diminished arpeggios which always fit well in any key. You can also use a Locrian (natural 2 or #2), 2nd Mode Harmonic Minor or a 2nd Mode Harmonic Major.<br>  <br>  For the b9 chords, or the #9, play altered chords..... <br>  <br>  Ex....G 7b9 or #9 ...<br>  you can play  G       Ab       A#        B        Db       Eb         F<br>  <br>  For +9 chords or add 9 chords, you can use any minor 7th scales or dorian modes.
HUDjXVOyaa	If you are looking for a way to reduce the rick of people reproducing your artwork from online images, a good way is to avoid displaying high resolution images. Only display low-res. or small images, so when they try to blow it up the digital pixels of the image go out of proportion and blocky.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to get more serious about art, building your own website is the way to go. There are options where you can have a professional designer disable the left click of a person's mouse when ever they are on your website.|`|u4KK07hnaa	yeah i just read in the paper this moring about facebook keeping all the rights to your profile content FOREVER so dont post there. everyone has full right to your photos unless you copyright them. so ya you need to copyright your drawings and paintings........|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Always use secured sites only, if U sell your artwork. <br>  I just heard something on the radio today about work that is on Face Book not being protected.

This is an easy, and somewhat theatrical piece that will allow you to show a range that is fun and sweet.  Not so showy but is simple and short.  An easy song to prepare.

wmKb8LeCaa	Louisa May Alcott has been my favorite writer for many years now. I think the reason she is one of the greatest American Authors is her stories simply relate to all people. She wrote about her life and her simple, ordinary philosophies and basically told a story about the characters. I think almost everyone will find themselves in these characters because they're dynamic and realistic.

AA10729675	But, we cannot.  Epitaphs are for tombs.  You are alive!
AA10729675	Because otherwise it would not be complete and would not give us the whole picture.  Each culture has an impact on another at some point in time.  When I was young, no one talked about India.  After the Beatles then we did, and the impact has been great.  So, we need to know what other human beings are doing or have been doing in the past.  It also gives us lessons in the immediate present.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	A famous quote by George Santayana has it that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."|`|zEoRcL91aa	Including all cultures would be impossible!

LoYmhKIFaa	I think its called a bridge, its when you stand on your hands and feet, an push your back upwards. <br>  Or you can put your back leg up, arms in second and keep your back up.|`|3MAi3vJmaa	The other answers people have put are accurate or you can do what I like to call the seal pose when you lie on your stomach, push the upper half of your body up with your hands with your legs outstretched behind you, together, and straight. While, your shoulders are down and your hips are on the floor. You can also put your hands a little farther in front of you if you need to take it easy at first, then go back farther every day. It really does stretch your back. Another exercise other people and I like to call is the superman stretch. Again you lie on your belly and then you raise your head (keeping it in line with your spine), your arms, and your legs for 10 seconds (or less, again if you need to take it easy at first) and then lower back down. This stretch is nicknamed the superman stretch because you're in a position like superman. One last thing I will mention are back raises. You can place your feet under a sofa (if your feet can fit), ask someone to hold your feet, or some other downward force to keep your feet on the ground.  Next you raise your back, shoulders down, head in line with your spine, and arms outstretched. You hold that position for as long as you can and then lower slowly back down. Eventually, you will be able to do this stretch without a downward force. I hope this helps you.|`|0eOfphnRaa	These upper and lower back stretches can help you to loosen up and relax your entire back and make it more flexible:<br>  <br>  Upper back: <a href="http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/upper-back-stretches.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/upper...</a><br>  <br>  Lower back: <a href="http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/lower-back-stretches.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/lower...</a>|`|F5vw66EJaa	Here are some things that you could do. <br>   - You could try to do side stretches like windmills. <br>   - You could do back bends.<br>   - Doing things like yoga will also help a whole lot.<br>   - If you sit on the flor with your legs straight out in front of you and  - touch/ hold your toes that should help, you could also do the same type of stretch but with your legs spread apart.
wmccNftAaa	You can, sure. Alot of girls at dance camps will swim in the lake in their leo's.

I would not recommend it.

oXPDFw4daa	Rapid Fix can (and should be) be reused up to the point where it is exhausted.  Keep in mind that the purpose of fixer is to remove the unexposed silver from the emulsion, so silver will accumulate in fixer as it is used and reused.  That accumulation of silver has two consequences.  First, it slows down the fixing action, so you need to allow more time for subsequent rolls of film (or prints in the case of paper fixer).  Second, as the silver accumulates in the fixer, it is possible that it can be redeposited if the fixer is reused too many times.  The objective should be to determine when the fixer has been exhausted to the point that it should no longer be used.<br>  <br>  Manufacturers specify a capacity for fixers - either as the number of rolls per unit of chemical volume, or the number of 8x10 prints per unit of volume.  That number is probably conservative (you can probably squeeze a bit more through the chemical), but many photographers prefer to take an even more cautious approach and dispose of the fix before they reach the limit.  <br>  <br>  You can purchase (or make) a fixer test chemical that can be used to determine whether the fix is approaching exhaustion.  Edwal HypoCheck is one brand.  With conventional fix, you put a drop of the HypoCheck into the fixer - if you can see a precipitate, then the fixer is exhausted.  With rapid fix, you should take a small sample of the fix, add a drop of teh HypoCheck, and shake.  If the solution is cloudy, then it is exhausted.<br>  <br>  When processing film, another way to determining whether the fix is exhausted is to determine how long it takes to clear the film.  The clearing time gradually becomes longer as the fixer is used; the usual rule of thumb is that when the clearing time becomes twice the clearing time with fresh fixer, it is exhausted.<br>  <br>  One other point - and this may be where the person who told you that fixer should be used 'one shot' is coming from - t-grain films such as T-Max  exhaust fixer faster than conventional films.  That does not mean that they should be used one-shot, but it does mean that you cannot push as many rolls of t-grain films through a given quantity of fixer as you can if you are using conventional films such as Tri-X or HP-5.

First of all, try to think of a name that people can actually pronounce and isn't too complicated. There's nothing more frustrating than not even really knowing a characters name. Try thinking of certain objects or names that interest you or are relevant to the character and make something new out of them. Add a few letters or drop them an rearrange it so it makes something unique. That's the best advice I can give. I know how hard this can be.

The grammar, simple to fix, just have a look through...<br>  2. you're giving too much information in the first couple of paragraphs... there is nothing for the reader... no suspicion (even for realistic fiction there needs to be some suspicion) <br>  3. (in my opinion) well when i read realistic fic. i hate it when the author is too exact or when they point every thing out... so (you don't have to do this... ) be a little vauge about the room a little deatil... not a lot...<br>  4. Max doesn't seem like he's been bella's best friend since they were four. if he were he'd have a bit more understanding... just saying cause it seems a bit unrealistic...<br>  5. The whole lucas sharing rooms with a girl would never ever happen in a real boarding school... again a bit unrealistic... don't just plunge into it... take time with your writing...<br>  6. The storyline hasn't fully developed yet and you are throwing things in really really fast... she shouldn't be so open with rory the first time she meets him, i mean would you just open up to a complete stranger? no, right?<br>  7. the thing with lucas is coming waaay too fast.. no problem to keep the reader interested.....<br>  8. other then that it was god.. it just needs some polishing :) keep it up!|`|XxtVwslraa	Very boring. I didn't read much of it because you failed to capture my attention. You're writing is weak at best and the main character is annoying. There were so many opportunities to strengthen your characters that you just passed over. There's a lack of concrete details to place the reader in the story. The grammar issues were distracting as is all the extra commentary. The situations seem a tad bit unrealistic. The story moves so fast. There is a lot of summary as if your just flying through the story and only mentioning random things.|`|sMyfAmmKaa	You write a very good romance story! You might want to correct the grammar and put punctuations, too. You might also want to change the name Bella. The main star in Twilight is named Bella. People might think you're unoriginal, no offense. The statement "Bella means beautiful in Italian" is a nice sentence, though. Maybe you might find a name that is short and easy to pronounce and means 'gorgeous' or (something along the line of that) in Italian. And you could also change the word 'gay' into 'girl' because it might offend others. And I do not like the idea of using bad words in a book. But other than that, it is a good book. Keep on writing!|`|1QDRAUgGaa	well.. actually i didn't read it fully just the part wer  your story stated the main character was named BELLA and her friend or girlfriend's name was EMILY. those names actually reminded me a little of the twilight series maybe you need to rename them...<br>  <br>  sorry i haven't read it all...|`|NOcsIdFHaa	I love your story sooo much!

Can you make some more chapters?|`|c2a6d7461ab5b5b6b327c0eb875177f9aa	I read all of chapter 1<br>  <br>  i must say you have the skill in story writeing. you now how to tell a story.<br>  <br>  also i agree with floppytoast accept the name part.
yVsuERSFaa	AGREED<br>  <br>  half of the die hard hp lovers seem to kno so much about twilight and the twilighters are just asking retarded questions that could be found on the searchbar. then the so called 'twilight haters' swarm to the question and answer using infinite knowlegde about the series. hp and twilight fans are so opinionated. <br>  if a typical, have nothing better to do hp fan sees something that says: hp is bad and even if that answer had a great arguement, they would give it a thumbs down and try to say that the person is stupid or something. Visa versa for those kind of twilight fans.<br>  i once saw a person called twi hater or something like that and when i checked his/her profile, i found her/his answers littered with twilight questions. serisouly, for something you hate so much, you sure pay a lot of attention to...<br>  also, i don't get the whole 'this book is better and this is not' concept. it is extremely immature, at times hurtful and a complete waste of time.<br>  <br>  Aye.|`|Z19gRYZwaa	people are childishly defensive of their favourite book series (originally it was the Twilighters, but then the HP fans responded in kind) and they get so caught up in proving that person wrong that they fail to notice how stupid it is. <br>  <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" rel="nofollow">http://xkcd.com/386/</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: aye|`|YEfW3vI0aa	All in favour of peace between the two series say 'aye'<br>  <br>  Yes.

vyz7uICNaa	well, i didn't  know that true blood was a book,or series or whatever, but i kind of like both,i guess they are alike because both of the main characters are in love with a mortal, but i kind of like the twilight books better, but the tv show true blood is better than the twilight movie in my opinion|`|y3xhmGWkaa	I absolutely love true blood and the books r very interesting so as twilight,but twilight the movie was no the same as reading,but true blood has changes but better!|`|PDJJd8oEaa	yeah true blood the show is cheesy . i like twilight<br>  <br>  <br>  PEACE:)|`|cxip3nA8aa	I hate both of them, how about that?|`|fI4LqMVMaa	TRUE BLOOD!  In my opinion, true blood (which is the name of the show, not the books.  The books are the sookie stackhouse series by charline harris) is a significantly more mature version of twilight.  While the HBO series contains some adult scenes, the relationships seem more realistic and the series is more unpredictable.  I like a series where things happen that I don't expect.

I dunno. Just pick something you like, because you like it, and it impresses you, or is good enough for you, instead of strangers. Once you can get subscribers, even with an obscure title, they'll know what to expect... Perhaps your name could give off the mood of your blog.

uEjES9Q2aa	First start with the writing. Publishing a book is not so easy. You would need characters for your story and your story could start anyway you like. It could start as the beginning of a day with your hero, or heroine, waking up, or you characters being in battle. Whatever you like.<br>  <br>  I have experience with writing, and time and time again it helps me strengthen my grammar and my writing skills, so you train in your writing first.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	Before you write anything, get a full idea in ur head... like JK Rowling (Harry Potter). She sat an entire plane ride just thinking about what would happen in her book. Along the way, jot down some things just so u won't forget|`|hl4kkvXhaa	It depends on the person.  For a lot of writers, they like to work the details of the story (characters, plot line of overall story, chapter plot lines, etc.) out in an outline.  That's usually the best way for a new writer to go about starting a story after the idea has come to them.<br>  <br>  For me, I tend to get the idea from out of nowhere and just begin writing.  It isn't until I get maybe two or three chapters finished, and my creative "juices" start trickling, that I actually slow down enough to concentrate on creating my outline.  Depending on the type of story, I may not even bother with the outline (such as short stories that end up written before I realize they're complete).<br>  <br>  As for publishing, your first goal is to write the story.  Then proofread it.  Then edit again and again until you feel that it is perfect.  Don't think your rough draft is perfect because they never are.  Even the most seasoned professionals know that they have to thoroughly pick the story apart to make sure every last "i" is dotted and every last "t" is crossed.  After you do this, then find people to read the story and give you feedback as to what is strong, what is weak and needs revising, and what should be cut completely from the story.  <br>  <br>  The hardest part of this is knowing who to show it to.  Don't bring it here, or anywhere else that allows you to publicly "publish" your work for free.  That is a deal breaker with publishers.  Why would they pay you for a story that everyone has free access to, right?  And, believe me, they do check these days.  I have an editor friend who has been told by her publishing house that she is in charge of finding an Internet "sleuth" to seek out freely posted stories that authors are trying to have published with them.  So...no blogging or posting anywhere on the web other than a site designed for writers to get together as a circle and discuss each other's manuscripts.  You often have to pay a small fee for membership, but the site stays locked to non-members, meaning your story won't be stolen (as they often are on free sites), and you will get the necessary feedback for you work.  Once you have your feedback, you can begin rewriting again.<br>  <br>  After that, you may still want to pay an editor to refine your work further.  Since you are new to this, they will be more adept at setting your manuscript up in a manner that is suitable for an agent and/or publisher.  A lot of publishers have stopped accepting unsolicited manuscripts, and expect you to submit through an agent, so if you choose not to have an agent, make sure you know who will review your work without one.<br>  <br>  Writing is something that takes a lot of hard work and dedication.  You need to have a strong command of the language you intend to write in, so daily practice is essential, as is keeping up-to-date with grammar, style, and usage rules.  For this reason, I recommend taking as many writing classes and/or workshops as you can, and reading a lot.  Read anything and everything you can, including books on how to write.  Don't just learn how to write to be a novelist, but learn to write poetry, magazine articles, etc...even if you never use those skills.  As a writer, they will still help you.  <br>  <br>  If you are serious about being a writer, then working hard won't be a problem.  In fact, my biggest problem is finding enough time to devote as I want to writing.  I could sit and write all day long if I had the time, rather than just my two hours set aside each day.  It takes a lot of talent, skill, and determination to write, but if it's something you really want to do, you will keep at it, even if it feels like you'll never see your work published.|`|RB3IGAeRaa	Well first you have to have an idea, a form of writing (or voice), and a lot to go on. If you read alot, you can probably find out which type of voice you like to read, and chances are you will write with a similar style. If you have a certain idea about one section in your head, just write that part, and go from there. This will help you build your story. Writing a book takes a long time, and getting published is very difficult. Don't think you are going to be done anytime soon. Just practice writing and start anywhere you have an idea. Good luck!|`|EsWdzJlYaa	Scribble down the outline of the story and maybe even the characters.Then you can make the characters more believable by giving them personalities.Once this is done just start a rough draft.If your story is interesting enough,you will know where to start.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	at fourteen i think you need to build up on your vocabulary first before you're able to catch the attention a publisher as well as the many different styles of writing.i think a good idea would be to just write a story, place it on www.fictionpress.com and hope that people will review your story.<br>  <br>  it's sounds tough but you might just make it.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Come up with an idea and some possible characters. Scribble down as much information as you can, maybe even a couple of short paragraphs. Outline a possible beginning. From there, see where your imagination takes you ...|`|27d6fd19ae9c4fc896c24ed094c8929faa	First off you must discipline yourself. Determine to devote at least an hour a day to either writing or studying your art. Everyone wants to write a book and have it published. Often the difference between being published and just having a book isn't talent so much as perspiration.<br>  <br>  You can have the best story ideas in the world but they must be presented in such a way that others grasp the vision of the story. Often publishers only read the first couple of pages. If you haven't caught their attention by then it's rejected. So it's important to understand what the publisher is looking for and how to tweak the storyline to catch his interest.<br>  <br>  The story has to flow and the character developed. Too much info at the beginning removes the intrigue. Too little & there is no interest in the character.<br>  <br>  A good place to start is www.fictionfactor.com I got a lot of excellent tips there. Also www.helium.com is a good place to try out your writing and let others critique it. It's mainly poetry & freelance stuff. But personally I feel it's better to start off with short stories & articles while developing your talent.<br>  <br>  Also develop a thick skin. Unless you can handle criticism you'll never be a good writer. Some of my best changes came about because of criticism.<br>  <br>  Then when you complete the book and feel ready to show it to the world submit it first to writing contests like Amazon's. It doesn't cost anything and there is no expense on your part. Writing isn't as cheap & easy as so many think. It took me 8 yrs. to get mine the way it needed to be. The story was there all along but first it was too short & not enough details. Most writers use too much detail. But I'm quite proud of the finished product and the way it shines a light on the poverty of Appalachia though fictional as well as the beauty.|`|fkwYvFBRaa	How far along are you?<br>  <br>  Click on the site below and I hope I have helped.

One I read recently was The Witch of Portabello by Paolo Coelho. It's an excellent book by a highly acclaimed writer that I feel will be looked at as an important piece in the future (it was only published recently). Another one of my favorite books is Lolita by Vladmir Nobakov (really though, I like almost anything by him). If you like a very powerful, short read, I recommend The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrisson. It is a wonderful book that examines what true beauty is. Any of these reads will touch you in a powerful way. These are books that really examine life at its nitty gritty.

It is about his life, getting expelled from school, living in New York on his own, his relationships with his parents and sister, Holden's feelings of depression/suicide after his beloved brother Allie's death, and basically how it is hard for Holden to let go of being a kid now that he is turning into a young adult. The Catcher in the Rye is a metaphor for what Holden wants to be. It is about kids playing in fields of rye. He wants to be "the catcher in the rye", who catches little kids if they are about to fall off the edge, of say a cliff/hill etc. That fall represents the fall into adulthood, which Holden is dreading. Anyways, it's a great book and I really liked it!|`|Ta7snyIoaa	It's about a boy name Holden Caulfield (sp) and he gets kicked out of his school and his many adventures leading up to his now location. <br>  In the book Holden describes that he wants to be "a catcher in the rye" he wants to be in the middle of a field of rye and catch little kids from falling over.|`|TxKvjBuTaa	The death of morality?

vexI66HBaa	If your faking the emotion then no. Also I have to agree with Kemmey (I think that was it). Acting is about doing. You're either pleading for a loved ones life or your just faking it. If you really try to get someone to spare your loved one then you will really feel it. Its all psycho-physical. It's simply good v.s. bad acting. Many actors have ended up in relationships with their co-stars because of the real emotions brought on by the circumstances of the play. But her not wanting to slap you is just a natural response to her being your friend. Whether she is into you or not is a question to be answered in another forum. If you want acting advice then she needs to commit to the circumstances of the play. Otherwise check with the relationship threads.|`|4dgrwFU4aa	For good acting there is no fake emotion.

8eRMjkcJaa	As quoted from Stephenie Meyer's website:<br>  "I woke up (on that June 2nd) from a very vivid dream. In my dream, two people were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods. One of these people was just your average girl. The other person was fantastically beautiful, sparkly, and a vampire. They were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that A) they were falling in love with each other while B) the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her immediately. For what is essentially a transcript of my dream, please see Chapter 13 ("Confessions") of the book."<br>  <br>  By the way, this is the day that Bella and Edward were supposed to go to Seattle, but went to the meadow instead.|`|cxip3nA8aa	I hate Twilight with a passion.

JjCqTCeXaa	The first quote is simply Atticus teaching the children why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird. To be more in-depth, this quote is also a symbol of Boo Radley, Tom Robinson and other African-Americans in the novel. The African-Americans in the novel are 'innocent', they don't harm anyone, are hard-working and mind their own business. They love God, and they don't do anything against 'white' people. They even work for 'whites' in the story!<br>  <br>  The second quote is Atticus saying that we shouldn't treat children like 'children'- that is, we shouldn't avoid answering their questions. They're curious, and if adults avoid answering a child's questions, it only makes them think more about it, and this could muddle them up. <br>  <br>  These two quotes show us that Atticus is a caring, loving, morale and thoughtful man. He teaches his kids that condemning innocent people is a wicked thing to do, and that choosing not to answer children's questions is like degrading them. <br>  Hope I helped!|`|01hXfIG1aa	The first quote is Atticus explaining to Jem and Scout that it a sin to kill mockingbirds as they do not hurt others in any way. Mockingbirds can be prarlleled to the Arthur Radley who is prevented from living his life the way he wants to due to circumstance and Tom Robinson who is accusesd for raping a white girl just because he is an african-american. <br>  <br>  Other mockingbirds in the story are Atticus who is condemed by society for taking up the Tom Robinson case and Miss Maudie as the foot-washing Baptists disapprove of her love of nature. Killing a Mockingbird could also refer to killing innocence or justice as seen during the trial. <br>  <br>  The second quote shows that Atticus believes in explaining things to people in a way that they understand regarrdless of age. He does not talk down to children like Miss Caroline Fisher and Mrs Merriweather and gives them the respect they deserve.|`|xdmKbgoUaa	It's a metaphor. The mockingbird was a symbol for both Boo Radley and Tom. They were innocent, and throughout the book had good intentions. But the town at large still "sinned," by convicting Tom because he was black, and thinking of Boo as a malicious phantom, because it was more exciting than the real story.<br>  <br>  The first quote shows that Atticus tries his hardest to be fair, and won't hurt someone or something just for his own amusement. The second quote shows that he wants to be honest with his children, to treat them as people, instead of degrading them and viewing their questions as things to be brushed under the rug.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	The African American (It's been a while since i read this... i don't remember his name sorry) represents the mockingbird. He was innocent, just like the mockingbird, and was about to be condemned to death... sorry i'd explain more but just in case, i don't want to give away the whole story.|`|XCn2dK1laa	the first quote just explains why it's bad to kill a mockingbird.If you read carefully,you can compare Tom Robinson to the mockingbird because both tom and the bird are innocent and it's a sin to kill them.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	It just means that if a child asks you a question, answer them properly, and don't evade them because then they will become curious and will find out the truth the wrong way.|`|HrsPCzaBaa	That's pretty self explanitory.|`|iB22RWkGaa	It's just explaining why its bad to kill mockingbirds|`|PJyrWmdfaa	I think because Jem killed one.

sunEk8NVaa	This was the scenario back then.<br>  <br>  Japan was at war with China. Despite being a military superpower, their war with China was using up their resources. During that time, most of their resources especially oil were coming from the US. The US did not approve of Japanese aggression in China and they declared an embargo on Japan. This means they would stop supplying Japan with raw materials. So where would Japan get their resources to continue the war now?<br>  <br>  The Japanese High Command carefully discussed this and came up with the conclusion that the Dutch East Indies would be the best place to gain resources. But they knew that an attack on the Dutch East Indies would probably bring the US into the war. So they had to find a way to prevent the US from fighting with them until they conquered the Dutch East Indies. That's when they planned Pearl Harbor. The goal of Pearl Harbor was to disable the American fleet for a few months to give them enough time to conquer the Dutch East Indies and to absorb its resources to finance their war in China and the US once the US' navy was rebuilt.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor because they knew America was going to have to enter the Pacific Theatre of WWII sooner or later. America's allies, China etc. were being attacked by the Japanese. The Japanese believed it would be a good idea to try and destroy all of the Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific. The attack was set up to do just that. Unfortunately for the Japanese. the carriers were not in Pearl Harbor so they destroyed almost every battleship, cruiser, supply ship, and plane in and around Pearl Harbor.|`|fy35c6vGaa	There is allot of unnecessary anti US spin here and that is unfortunate. Japan only attacked the US because of the embargo and rising tension in the Pacific.. <br>  <br>  The soldiers, sailors and airmen on the ground did not see it coming but the US government and intelligence did. <br>  <br>  Here is the real reason why<br>  <br>  The escalating conflict between China and Japan influenced U.S. relations with both nations, and ultimately contributed to pushing the United States toward full-scale war with Japan and Germany.<br>  At the outset, U.S. officials viewed developments in China with ambivalence. On the one hand, they opposed Japanese incursions into northeast China and the rise of Japanese militarism in the area, in part because of their sense of a longstanding friendship with China. On the other hand, most U.S. officials believed that it had no vital interests in China worth going to war over with Japan. Moreover, the domestic conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists left U.S. policymakers uncertain of success in aiding such an internally divided nation. As a result, few U.S. officials recommended taking a strong stance prior to 1937, and so the United States did little to help China for fear of provoking Japan.<br>  <br>  In 1940 and 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt formalized U.S. aid to China. The U.S. Government extended credits to the Chinese Government for the purchase of war supplies, as it slowly began to tighten restrictions on Japan. The United States was the main supplier of the oil, steel, iron, and other commodities needed by the Japanese military as it became bogged down by Chinese resistance but, in January, 1940, Japan abrogated the existing treaty of commerce with the United States. Although this did not lead to an immediate embargo, it meant that the Roosevelt Administration could now restrict the flow of military supplies into Japan and use this as leverage to force Japan to halt its aggression in China. After January 1940, the United States combined a strategy of increasing aid to China through larger credits and the Lend-Lease program with a gradual move towards an embargo on the trade of all militarily useful items with Japan.<br>  <br>  The Japanese Government made several decisions during these two years that exacerbated the situation. Unable or unwilling to control the military, Japan's political leaders sought greater security by establishing the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" in August, 1940. In so doing they announced Japan's intention to drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia. However, this Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan's economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to "liberate" the long-subject peoples of Asia. In fact, Japan would have to launch a campaign of military conquest and rule, and did not intend to pull out of China.<br>  <br>  At the same time, several pacts with Western nations only made Japan appear more of a threat to the United States. First, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940 and thereby linked the conflicts in Europe and Asia. This made China a potential ally in the global fight against fascism. Then in mid-1941, Japan signed a Neutrality Pact with the Soviet Union, making it clear that Japan's military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests. A third agreement with Vichy France enabled Japanese forces to move into Indochina and begin their Southern Advance. The United States responded to this growing threat by temporarily halting negotiations with Japanese diplomats, instituting a full embargo on exports to Japan, freezing Japanese assets in U.S. banks, and sending supplies into China along the Burma Road.<br>  <br>  Although negotiations restarted after the United States increasingly enforced an embargo against Japan, they made little headway. Diplomats in Washington came close to agreements on a couple of occasions, but pro-Chinese sentiments in the United States made it difficult to reach any resolution that would not involve a Japanese withdrawal from China, and such a condition was unacceptable to Japan's military leaders. Faced with serious shortages as a result of the embargo, unable to retreat, and convinced that the U.S. officials opposed further negotiations, Japan's leaders came to the conclusion that they had to act swiftly. For their part, U.S. leaders had not given up on a negotiated settlement, and also doubted that Japan had the military strength to attack the U.S. territory. Therefore they were stunned when the unthinkable happened and Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The following day, the United States declared war on Japan, and it soon entered into a military alliance with China. When Germany stood by its ally and declared war on the United States, the Roosevelt Administration faced war in both Europe and Asia.|`|52otNiElaa	Oil<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What's up with the thumbs down it's true.|`|REUqZfSeaa	Japan is an island nation (as I'm sure that you know!) and much of their landscape is mountainous and does not support crops and/or grazing land. Also Japan has a large population.<br>  <br>  Prior to World War II Japan and China had an uneasy history, and Japan had plans to expand and create more space for themselves to live and to grow crops and graze livestock. They also wanted to create a Japanese Empire in Asia.<br>  <br>  Most people agree that the Second Sino-Japanese War (the war between Japan and China) began on July 7, 1937 although China did not officially declare war on Japan until after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.<br>  <br>  In July 1941, the United States, in support of China, issued an oil embargo on Japan. This embargo threatened to completely destroy Japans military campaign and their economy.<br>  <br>  Japan realised that it would not be long before the US was drawn into WWII and they recognised that they would be one of USAs first targets.<br>  <br>  They decided to strike first. Once again being an island nation is was always going to mean that it would be a Navy which would be the biggest threat against Japan. Planes were incapable of reaching Japan from the US without carriers and soldiers also would need to be transported by ship or carrier. Therefore the Japanese believed that it would be in their best interests to destroy the USA's naval fleet and therefore reduce the threat to themselves. <br>  <br>  On November 17, 1941 the United States ambassador to Japan sent a cable to the State Department warning that an attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor was imminent. However obviously the cable was ignored.|`|MHMndoCcaa	Because Japan had attacked and colonized parts of China, Korea, and South East Asia, which were allies of the US.

The American response was to enact a trade embargo against Japan for oil and steel, as well as other raw materials.  Japan has little of these resources, so the embargo could potentially cripple the Japanese war machine.  So Japan chose to attack Pearl Harbor, where the majority of the US Pacific fleet was stationed.  By knocking out Pearl Harbor the US would be crippled in the Pacific, and the Japanese would be free to conquer more territory, including areas that had the resources they needed.<br>  <br>  And they nearly succeeded, too.  Fortunately the US aircraft carriers were out of port at the time of the attack, so they were saved.  Aircraft carriers proved to be the most important part of the Navy in WW2, so the US was able to rebuild the fleet and go on to have victories at Midway and other locations in the WW2 Pacific theater.|`|AA11586960	because they believed America was going to attack them first <br>  <br>  the USA continually condemned Japan for its barbaric expansion into China

WLizHwtkaa	It quite hard to establish exactly when ironclad (or fully iron) ships were first invented and exactly when submarines were first invented. It is certain that these ideas were around before the Civil War.<br>  <br>  What is certain is the following:<br>  <br>  The Merrimac/Virginia was an ironclad, employing iron plates bolted on to a wooden hull. The Monitor was an entirely iron vessel designed from the ground-up (with 49 patentable inventions within her, by the way). Their battle at Hampton Roads was the first time two vessels of this type had faced each other. The Merrimac/Virginia proved that conventional wooden warships were no match for her, but the battle with the Monitor proved only that war at sea would be very different in future.<br>  <br>  The Hunley, which was a true submarine, was built of iron. She put to sea only three times, she sank each time and killed her crew each time. For her third sailing she had been forbidden to submerge, so her attck on the Housatonic was made on the surface. Nevertheless she bacame the first submarine to successfully attack and sink an enemy vessel. Sadly (for her crew) she was lost comletely either during or immediately after this attack.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some.|`|kacLYFrHaa	NO, ironclads were not invented during the ACW. In fact the British and the French had both had ironclads before the ACW began and ironclads first saw service during the Crimean War. HOWEVER, until March of 1862 ironclads had not fought each other. And the ACW saw the first all iron warships (early ironclads had iron plates on wooden hulls). Ironclads also were not submarines. The first to use ironclads during the war was the Confederacy.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	The earliest ironclads were Korean. Invented by Admiral Sun-Shin Yi. they were called Turtle Boats. <br>  <br>  This was in 1592.|`|knKVjOE6aa	No. The first iron warships were used in the Crimean War 1854 to 1856.

Both submarines and otherwise. The Union used submarines before the Confederacy and the Confederacy had Ironclad ships before the Union. However, neither side invented them, nor were Ironclad ships invented during the time of the Civil War.|`|MQIc7X0Zaa	yes they were made in the civil war. they were actually ships above water that had a very thick steal armor around it|`|woc0kkiQaa	<a href="http://answersgetinthis.snappingshots.com" rel="nofollow">http://answersgetinthis.snappingshots.co...</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|1hvrQYWiaa	'Ships' implies ocean going vessels rather than ones that can operate only on rivers or in shallow coastal waters.<br>   The first ironclad warships were invented and used by admiral Yi Sung Sin of the Cholla state in Korea. They were known as turtle ships and used in July 1592 at the battle of The Yellow Sea. They were oar powered.<br>   In the industrial era, the first ocean going all metal war ship was HMS Lion, completed in Britain in 1860. It was steam powered.<br>   So, America, whether the Confederacy or the Union, was some way behind in producing ironclad ships. Nevertheless CSS Huntley was the first operational submarine in history. It was powered by a hand cranked screw propeller.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Yes they were invented during the Civil war. The most famous was the Merrimac and the Monitor. They were steel ships Steam Powered. Not quite submarines. The battle between these two ships ended in a draw. BUT, the north can make much more of these ships and they were great at ramming their wooden counterparts.<br>  <br>  As far as who invented the technology? I think the North Stole it from the South. But I am not sure.
ZB9zkbxxaa	Lt. Colonel Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg,Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz<br>  <br>  They tried to assassinate Hitler. They were the people behind the Valkyrie plot.<br>  <br>  THE BERGHOF<br>  <br>  On July 11, 1944, Staff Officer Lt. Colonel Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, convinced that he and he alone could assassinate Hitler, attended another conference at the Berghof. Concealed inside his briefcase was a time bomb. Waiting outside in a gateaway car was his co-conspirator, Captain Friedrich Klausing. Inside the Berghof, Stauffenberg telephones his colleagues in Berlin to tell them that neither Goering nor Himmler is present. They insist that the attempt be aborted. Stauffenberg then returns to Berlin to plan his next assassination attempt.<br>  <br>  RASTENBURG<br>  <br>  Stauffenberg’s second attempt occurs at Hitler’s Wolf’s Lair headquarters in East Prussia. On July 15, 1944, he attends a Fuhrers briefing and observes with dismay that Himmler is again absent. The attempt was once again aborted.<br>  <br>  RASTENBURG<br>  <br>  Thirty six year-old Stauffenberg’s final attempt occured on July 20, 1944. Four days earlier, the attempt was decided upon during a meeting at his residence at No. 8 Tristanstrasse, Wansee. Himmler or no Himmler, the attempt must go ahead, come what may. At 12.00pm Stauffenberg and General Fromm report to Field Marshal Keitel’s office for a briefing before entering the conference room. At 12.37pm, Stauffenberg places his briefcase containing the bomb under the map table, then leaves the room on the pretext of making a telephone call. The officer (Colonel Brandt, No.4) who took his place noticed the briefcase and with his foot pushed it further under the table. The heavy oak table support protected Hitler from the full force of the explosion. At 12.42pm, the bomb explodes. By this time Stauffenberg is on his way back to Berlin. At 6.28pm a radio broadcast from Wolf’s Lair reports that Hitler is alive but only slightly wounded. Later that night, at 12.30am, Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz, are arrested and executed by firing squad in the inner courtyard of the Bendlerstrasse Headquarters.<br>  <br>  (Immediately after Colonel Stauffenberg's assassination attempt, his wife and four children were arrested and imprisoned. Freed by the Allies at the end of the war and pregnant at the time of her arrest, she gave birth to her fifth child while in prison.

PTdy6TWRaa	Steel wool or a steel wire brush and WD-40 may remove most if not all the rust. <br>  <br>  To preserve the piece so that it can't rust again you would need to season the surface much in the same way that cast iron cookware is seasoned. A coating of oil, grease or even wax rubbed into every surface will block exposure to the air and humidity thus preventing it from oxidizing. WD-40 has limited rust proofing capabilities as it's such a thin oil that tends to evaporate rather quickly. It works but would need to be reapplied more frequently than the other heavier oils, greases or wax.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	sure, wire brush, then rust oleum.

swlqQ1mYaa	The Meiji Restoration had its roots in the failing Tokugawa shogunate. As the shogunate failed due to to weak rulers, the elite - namely, samurai and daimyo - looked for alternate solutions to bolster the failing system. This caused something of a schism between those who believed that opening the country would be better, and those who believed that keeping the country closed would be better.<br>  <br>  Those who wanted to open the country were called rangaku (Dutch learning) scholars, but actually it meant anything European or American. They were experts on what was going in the rest of the world, and advised Japan's rulers to open the country to foreigners in order to avoid a war with a foregone conclusion (as China had) and to learn from them. Opposing them were the kokugaku (literally country learning) scholars, who insisted that the Japanese had no need of foreign aid in any way. Their ideas were summed up in their slogan "son-no jo-i (to-baku)", which meant "revere the emperor, expel the foreigner, bring down the bakufu". (To-baku was not often voiced because it was treasonous.)<br>  <br>  The leaders of the provinces of Satsuma and Choshu expanded upon this idea. They explained that Japan, as a superior country, shouldn't need to depend on accepting foreigners as the basis for their safety, and said that allowing them admittance to the country was a betrayal of the people and the culture. If the government was unwilling to protect the people's rights, they said they would enforce it themselves; so they began the movement to restore the emperor.<br>  <br>  It is the 'Meiji' Restoration, but in name only. The emperor was a popular figurehead who had been stripped of his power generations before. But Satsuma and Choshu promised that by restoring the emperor to his former power, the country could be saved. Instead, the Meiji Restoration was characterized by the influx of foreign cultere absorbed by Japan in an attempt to be considered properly 'civilized' by other countries.<br>  <br>  But it really was from above. Satsuma and Choshu, which had opposed Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Sekigahara more than two hundred years before, were seeking a way to gain power. By allowing themselves exclusive access to the emperor, who theoretically held complete power, they put themselves in a position of considerable influence. They then used this to change the country, regardless of protestors. (Not that there were many, since the majority of people considered them better than the weak shogunate.)|`|iphheJkoaa	Yes it was always from above. All hail Japan.|`|NTBaMjuNaa	Different from the Restoration in England, the Meiji Restoration was not only the resumption of the rule by the Imperial Court; It was a overhaul of the political and social systems of the nation. <br>  <br>  Japan needed the modernization and industrialization as well as the Western great powers, or it would be colonized by them.<br>  <br>  Since the Opium War, the Japanese political leaders had learned how modernization and industrialization were important for independence. <br>  <br>  As the new government established, various fields of the Japanese system were reformed, from the abolition of the feudalistic class system to the enforcement of cutting men's topknot. The most Japanese people were so obedient as to accept the orders by the government.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, the reforms were so radical that the government had to cope with innumerable rebellions by the former samurai class, who lost almost all the privileges within two years, and the farmers, who were imposed the taxation by three percents of the land price.

aYjZxu1Baa	lestat by far, the twilight characters are so plain and 2 d, they dont have any personality at all!|`|v70p2kgWaa	Hands down Lestat.  Edward barely qualifies as a vampire, actually I'm not quite sure if he even is a vampire.  Rice does a really great job making the monster seem human without losing the monster.  Meyer on the other hand takes a model that's more or less human and tries to thrown in some of the characteristics of the monster, but fails to do it properly.  Edward is 2 dimensional while Lastat is dynamic.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	no idea who lestat is and edward somewhat annoys me (the whole series kind of does, they're kinda cheesy- no offense) but everyone seems to like lestat so i'm gonna go read the book....|`|za9b8cHKaa	Totally different books/target audiences. Comparing Anne Rice to Stephenie Meyer would be like comparing apples to oranges.<br>  <br>  Edward was designed to appeal to teenage girls. Consequently, he has many personality traits that would make him likeable. He is a true gentleman. As a vampire, he is not at all frightening and that is a big part of the charm.<br>  <br>  Lestat is a spoiled brat first and foremost and a very troubled soul underneath. He was designed to be an engaging characters for adult audiences, one the readers could love and hate in equal measure. He is one very scary, impulsive vampire.<br>  <br>  My favourite vampire? Neither. I liked Louis from Interview with the Vampire. Dark but feels guilt for who/what he is.|`|lh0dihm1aa	LESTAT!!!!! OMG!<br>  I totally agree with you. Anne Rice is such an AWESOME writer! I love the way that she writes, and I do admit that Lestat is my favorite. I read "Interview With a Vampire" before I read "The Vampire Lestat" and I actually had a hard time starting it at first because I had a hard time placing vampires in modern day rock groups. ;)<br>  However, once I started writing, I couldn't stop! I love Lestat and he's such a better character than Edward ever could be.|`|lcNPeZOeaa	Okay, first offs, i think its a SIN to even say Lestat and Edward in the same sentence and comparing them is like takin it too far...!!!<br>  <br>  i've read twilight and ive read the vampire chronicles but twilight turned out to be such a big joke about vampires. of course we ardent vampire fans remember what a good vampire book is like. Lestat is a much more deep, and well developed character than edward. besides, the twilight series is for young adults and i dont see any kids reading The Vampire Chronicles. <br>  <br>  so, OF COURSE LESTAT!!!!! no doubt about it!!!|`|CKRfaRYvaa	Out of those two, definitely Lestat.  I did always have a soft spot for Louis, though.|`|QsfrOkcXaa	I think Lestat is a better vampire when it comes to a true vampire and I love Anne Rice's books, but I also loved the Twilight series. They are two completely different vampire reads, but I think they both are great!|`|lErNxNWVaa	Obviously Lestat.  But saying that, I preferred Marius.|`|0goQMjQAaa	Lestat, no doubt.|`|jKSGYzLCaa	i think lestat is to|`|oQzjoPlGaa	Obviously, Lestat is infinitely more developed, fully described, complex, etc, if you appreciate talented writing you will choose him. HOWEVER, in my opinion, Lestat does not have enough humanity in him for him to be a satisfying character to read about. With Edward, there is a more pleasing sense of humility and warped manic depressive personality to him. Teen girls love him so much because he thinks like a girl wants a guy to think - he loves Bella with all his heart and wouldnt even look twice at anyone else! What more could an insecure teenage girl want? (I'm not being derogatory, I'm only just out of my teens). Lestat does not fall completely in love with anyone apart from himself... Therefore, I enjoy reading about Edward more than I enjoy reading about Lestat. Give me more of Louis, any day.

onkUcy19aa	Let us now consider prophecies of Nostradamus, the French prophet Michel de Nostredame of the 1500s, that will shed light on our attempts at identifying the Antichrist. Nostradamus lived from 1503 to 1566 in France, and he wrote a book of prophecies consisting of ten sets (or Centuries) of 100 quatrains. The prophetic quatrains have been studied and published continuously in the years since his death. Here we will discuss some of the Nostradamus quatrains that are relevant to the subjects prophecies discussed on this web site, including the rise of the Antichrist in Russia, World War 3, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Iraq, Osama bin Laden and September 11 and the War against Terrorism, and the possibility of disease plagues including AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, Influenza, and SARS disease. The Nostradamus prophecies are in no particular order, which makes it very difficult to interpret them. Also, Dec. 23 2003 was the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nostradamus. Actually Nostradamus was born on Dec. 14, 1503 (Julian calendar), but because of the shift in days to the Gregorian calendar, it is actually Dec. 23 2003 that was the 500th anniversary of Nostradamus's birth. <br>  <br>  You could go to this website/s for more prophecies of Nostradamus:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/Number666/Nostradamus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/Number666...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dreamscape.com/morgana/titan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamscape.com/morgana/titan....</a><br>  <br>  These are some of the prophecies of Nostradamus on the dreamscape website:<br>  <br>  Selected Prophecies of Nostradamus<br>  The Idiot Heir and the Bloody One<br>  The 9/11/01 Hoax & More Genuine Quatrains<br>  <br>  The "New City"<br>  <br>  Prophecies of the Near Future?<br>  <br>  The Brothers<br>  <br>  1999: King of Terror?<br>  <br>  Apocalypse/Armageddon<br>  <br>  Signs of the Millennium<br>  <br>  Prophecies of the Antichrist?<br>  <br>  MABUS<br>  <br>  Famous Fulfilled (?)

A person punches you and you feel hurt or angered as a result.  <br>  <br>  Thoughts occur when one takes their own self to stimulate an action upon something else based on experiences.  A person punches you, you feel hurt or angered, but take these feelings and formulate an action (thought to a real, physical action) of acting in accordance to the situation (stand up for yourself if you can and you must, run away if the person is a professional boxer and you are nothing close to that, turning the other cheek, etc.)<br>  <br>  Which is more important?  Feelings themselves are not much to strictly base one's life upon because feelings do not produce anything on their own.  Only with thoughts about the feelings will one make things occur.<br>  <br>  With this, I'll favor thoughts as more important, but feelings to play a role in life.

People love to live wild lifestyles but they do not enjoy the consequences that come along with those choices. However, 70% of a society should not be punished for 30% of the societies mistakes.

sAYrfp1Gaa	About your question that was deleted:<br>  <br>  This is a really huge issue that I can only attempt to answer as broadly as I can. Blacks are still oppressed because history is cumulative and we are still as a country suffering from the effects of slavery. <br>  <br>  What you and most people seem to be unaware of is that slavery made victims of everybody, not just blacks. Blacks were the obvious victims of the situation but whites as well were brain-washed by the system that said they absolutely had to rely on slave labor in order to survive. Not everyone was consciously racist and cruel and the people who weren't almost couldn't even help their thoughts and their actions. It's called ideology, and it essentially made slaves out of everybody. <br>  <br>  Now you say you understand history, so I guess you know that even after slavery ended, various systems of legalized slavery were put into place to prevent blacks from gaining control of their own finances: some freed slaves were tied to their owners with some kind of fabricated "debt" to be repaid, some were  employed literally as indentured servants for large amounts of money that they could never have repaid, most lost a percentage of their wages for totally arbitrary reasons, and because they had no political power, there was no one to defend them and say what was happening to them, as free citizens, was illegal. So this went on for years and people did nothing because of various scare tactics from *terrorist* groups like the KKK. And they weren't the only culprit, random mobs would gather to reign terror on communities of law-abiding blacks whenever they saw fit in order to keep blacks "in their place". What is most important about all of this is that IT WENT ON WELL INTO THE 60s and 70s. That is the reason for the civil rights movement in the first place, it didn't just appear out of thin air, it was the result of strategic planning to finally defend themselves from years of disenfranchisement. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s house was bombed because of speeches he made, as a pastor in a  church, to encourage the bus boycott. So, if you can look at a history of bombings and murders and say it is a load of crap, then maybe you're just immune to that kind of stuff, but for me, it's legitimate. <br>  <br>  Another thing you may not know: during the JFK years, Kennedy was primarily concerned with establishing the US as a leader in foreign politics, and at the time America's reputation as notoriously racist was, in fact, embarrassing to the Kennedy administration. They were concerned with forming relationships with other countries and establishing themselves as an example to the rest of the world which they couldn't do with it's own racial atmosphere being a mess. The Civil Rights Act was signed into effect to try to fix this issue. So, the government acknowledged the racism and oppressive country in which they resided and finally were compelled, albeit for selfish reasons, to do something about it. And it fixed some things but you really have to understand that the beginning of blacks gaining some kind of prominence, political or otherwise, in the country began only 30 or 40 years ago, so no matter what things look like on the surface, underneath, you know there must still be prominence. Why else would we need affirmative action? Because otherwise, minorities might not be considered. <br>  <br>  I think the your problem and the problem of most Americans is that because they cannot see or imagine the immense cruelties that were inflicted onto blacks during slavery, that they simply cannot see how it happened. But trust me, look up some footage of lynching and aside from the obvious horror of watching a man being murdered, you will see women with their *children* in the audiences, grooming the next generation to continue their tradition of racism and oppression--like beheading in Europe in the Middle Ages--it's totally barbaric. Most people were lynched for ordinary things too, saying the wrong thing, being late to work, having an "air" of superiority... I'm sure you know that Emmett Till was 14 years old and brutally beaten to death for saying hello to a white woman, or that W.E.B Dubois records his first real encounter with racism as seeing the knees of a lynched man on display at the local butcher's... the list is endless.<br>  <br>  But I think we live in the age of political correctness, where things like racism and oppression have to be veiled in order to continue. Did you know, that until 2000, it was written in Alabama's state constitution that a white person and a black person could not get married? Until 2000?! I kid you not. In South Carolina, it was 1998. There are plenty of land-contracts in parts of Texas that still have language that forbids black ownership, and if I'm not mistaken, one piece of such land is owned by our former President! Speaking of presidents, think about the election: how many whisperings did you hear of "He only won because he's black"? No one talks about his JD from Harvard Law compared to Bush dropping out of Harvard Law to go to Harvard Business? Or about the questions people are asking that no one asked Bush. Or, how quickly do you think Obama would be impeached if he did even a tenth of the illegal things that Bush did. <br>  <br>  My friend, there are all kinds of double standards that exist out there regarding race. Your other question about oppression in other races is actually connected to the black-white issue in America. If you look up the history of colonialism, you will see that many instances of colonialism involve a white dominating country moving into a country inhabited by a minority population, often non-Christian, and non-techological. These minority groups are often the victims of cultural genocide (why do people from the Congo speak french, for example? or why do Brazilians speak Portuguese?) that wipes away their culture and replaces it with the one of the colonizing force. Within these periods of colonialism there is immense racism put in place, the victims of occupying forces are often brain-washed to believe that they are inferior and are taught to idolize the new government. There is a movie called "La Guerre d'Algerie" which talks about the movement for independence in Algeria from France. It follows the struggle for liberation from France as an occupying force as well as gives insight to the racial atmosphere, where the french see themselves as the superior race and often insult the Algerians by calling them "filthy Arabs". <br>  <br>  This is just one example for you to think about other than the Native American one. There are other examples where racism is used to justify oppression and as a means to gain control for occupying or dominant forces: the American internment camps created for the Japanese during WWII, the Vietnam war (another war of independence from France), the Congo gaining independence from Belgium... it's a huge, involved history that I think is worth doing more reading on if you're really interested.<br>  <br>  I apologize for my diatribe, but I am happy to inform anyone who is genuinely interested and asks questions looking for knowledge. I hoped I did you some good.<br>  <br>  Later.

dQmFoRRiaa	This is a fascinating, insightful, and yes playful sonnet on a common point of perception: we do see bits and pieces of others strewn about the glorious room -- the world we perceive, or in the life we make for ourselves -- and yet the essence of any one person is distinctive and individual.  We could never hope to achieve the grand anamorphosis that Nature so readily achieves.  If the analysis of a person into component parts is readily achieved by the unconscious mind, our reassembly of those parts is not fully possible.  Such an insight makes of our individuality something mysterious, seemingly 'holy'.  When I read your line on the permutations of DNA I was reminded of the blind watchmaker of Darwinian evolution (Richard Dawkins forgive me), or perhaps the post-transcriptional modification of messenger RNA (with its multiple splicing pathways).  The genius of Nature is that, in time, what we cannot consciously achieve is brought to stunning and profligate fruition.  Each of us is a one-time phenomenon, utterly unique.|`|nXxaAH0baa	hmmm,shows quite a bit of promise.It is a good start.Perhaps you could give the reader a little more of an idea of what it's about,but that's just one person's opinion.Good job and good luck with this one!|`|fqhtSiyxaa	i love it, but whats it about?|`|pHs6QjSgaa	great poem. maybe you could use some other expression instead of glorious room. room gives a narrow view. when u are talking of nature, i think it might be better to talk of something more vast. u might like to talk of small life and trivial stuff from everyday life but room doesnot seem to fit the atmosphere u're trying to evoke here.<br>  <br>  maybe u could also express the feeling that though u see parts of your love everywhere, your love is unique. or maybe if one reads the poem carefully, that idea is inbuilt.<br>  <br>  flower and love have become synonymous, almost a cliche. though the way you've put the image is remarkable n different from the regular use, maybe u could think of another image from nature. nature's waterfall maybe. but that totally depends on what u feel your love is like.<br>  <br>  in your poem nature and love intertwine. u speak of nature in formal terms. i like your treatment of nature and love. it has the classic flavour. maybe some day it will be prescribed in text books. i'm impressed.
yuuvBSKsaa	Heraclitus, the philosopher known for sayings like "You can't step in the same river twice" or "Everything is Fire"  maintained that while the Universe was in a constant state of change, the rules for change were not.   <br>  <br>  The "LOGOS"  was the universal unchanging logic that governed the ever changing Universe.|`|FoIxsunVaa	This whole argument is built on the idea that when I say everybody likes ice cream, it is a universal statement and that at no time could anyone ever turn down an ice cream (like before dinner.)<br>  <br>  The fact that mountains crumble and galaxies fade Impinges on the scientific stance, just like Einstein complaining about Quantum Theory because "God doesn't play dice." he was uncomfortable with the amount of variation that quanta allowed into the state of things. But science keeps proving that "God's watch" has very changeable parts.<br>  <br>  If everything changes, it does not do so ALL AND AT ONCE, so it's effect on our ability to reason is corrosive rather than absolutely negative.<br>  <br>  I think your thesis is based on all-or-nothing thinking.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	The fact remains that the only constant in life is change.<br>  <br>  Given that the change may take place over short or long periods of time, one generally has ample opportunity to reflect one set of data against another.

The answer depends on what you mean by change and what you mean by everything. Is rearranging the order of things not change? You can hardly call the universe static if the order of things are changing. What about chemical or nuclear reactions? Does the conversion of matter into energy constitute change? What about relocation in time and space?<br>  <br>  I can positively tell you that your definition of the "first principle of science" is incorrect. For the last century or so we've known that matter and energy are interchangeable. Thus energy is not constant in the universe. A scientist would say that the total mass-energy in the universe remains the same. Perhaps that's a lawyer's quibble for your purposes. But here's the bottom line: You can argue about whether everything changes (if you don't have anything useful to do) but you cannot argue that everything remains the same.|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	Wow, your bringing scientific analyse into a philosophical statement.<br>  <br>  Everything changes, yet nothing is new under the sun.<br>  <br>  X does indeed change, it changes to X, yet in the change, it remains the same.<br>  Changing never meant ' to create and destroy'. Change means to <br>  're-order'.<br>  <br>  Name yourself one 'second to second' when all matter in the universe never changed?<br>  It would have to be at a status of absolute zero. For energy is change and all matter contains energy.|`|af9f8af3a56d5bca6ce47e359dbb5c10aa	Yes, I could edit this because it needs it, but it is your thesis, so you find and fix your own mistakes. <br>  <br>  And there you have it; a constant.

It took me a second read over to understand everything here.  The wording is just a little off to me.  Especially in the third paragraph.  Something more clear could be written.  These are just very small sentence errors such as "... except the order in which those which can neither be..." I would take out that second which.  It just throws off the train of thought.  These are my opinions, but I'd say you're pretty fine.<br>  <br>  Overall I would agree.  Not everything could change.  Past events cannot change because they done and set.  The perceptions of the past and the subjective history of the past may change, but not the objective reality of the past.  That is just my first example I thought of when I read about this topic.  <br>  <br>  You make a strong claim that would be hard to go against: How can an order be disordered?  I do not think there is anything that can be X in one state and in all variables (ie. time, pressure, temperature, etc.) attributed to it, and then in the same state and same variables attributed to it be not-X.  The variables may change which could change X, but X cannot be what it is not if presented in the same equal conditions.<br>  <br>  These are my views on what you wrote.  I hope this helped.

vexI66HBaa	First of all, never underestimate the importance of a strong foundation in basic technique. Acting classes are a good way to learn the principles and theories of acting but they have their downside as well. In larger classes the opportunities to practice what you've learned can be few and far between. The best way to learn acting is by doing. Since you can't afford classes right now may I recommend a few books outlining some basic techniques:<br>  The Practical Handbook for the Actor<br>  -This is a great book for scene analysis and objectives.<br>  The Power of Acting by Robert Cohen<br>  -This book moves into some more advanced techniques and character work.<br>  An Actor Prepares by Stanislavski<br>  -A classic<br>  Sanford Meisner on Acting<br>  -Gives a good understanding on working with your partner and having a real conversation onstage.<br>  <br>  Those books should give you an idea of the basics. There is also a good variety of Theories in there. Try them out and see what works for you. <br>  As for practicing by yourself you can pick a monologue out every week. Memorize it and add it to a notebook. Then pick one particular aspect of the monologue (ex. objective, relationship, conflict, etc.) to work on. Then next week pick a new monologue and a new technique. This will build your technique and your audition packet. Then next time you have an audition you'll have a bunch of monologues at the ready that you can choose from.<br>  <br>  P.S. remember that Acting is best learned by doing it. Go out and be in shows. Also working by yourself is only going to get you so far. A fundamental rule of acting is that you are working off another person. Try to find someone in the communtiy that shares your interest and work on those duologues with them. AVOID MIRRORS LIKE THE PLAGUE! They put you in your head and make you worry about how you look when you should be thinking about the other person. If your working by yourself try to imagine what your imaginary partner is giving you. Use that imagination and above all HAVE FUN AND ENJOY IT!|`|tTCBTqVfaa	Best way is to act out a segment in a move, use the mirror, maybe even record with your webcam/corder to go over it and critique it.|`|AA11214755	Mimic people. look closely at at even benign details, like how somebody crosses their legs,and copy them. Try walking around your home or down the street as somebody completely different. <br>   <br>  see lots of plays. this does not need to be expensive, especially if there is a community college or some local theater company nearby. Even high school plays are a good choice. <br>  <br>  Read plays as well. Your local library is bound to have a good selection.<br>  <br>  Exercise your voice. Sing in the shower. hum. Say tongue twisters over and over again. Be shure to enunciate everything.<br>  <br>  If you are going to an audition, be shure that you have a strong introduction. Exude confidence, be loud, and smile. First impressions are everything. Also, make shure your hair is out of your face.<br>  <br>  Break a leg.

But it would be a terribly boring place without all the modern amenities, and friends and relatives around. So in reality, there really isn't one, so sad to say.

I think it is a rare commodity these days though it may plague you I think it is a gift...or should I say a privilege.  Most people these days don't take things into consideration or think about the consequences.   It feels like a burden but feel grateful that you have the presence of mind to "think"...being aware is a good thing...Im sure your thoughts keep you up at night and may feel like a hindrance but you will grow to love it.  It is like a super power learn to harness it so you can sleep at nights but also use it to grow.

J3H3C5ksaa	Twilight...so sh^tty I had to SELL my books, I seriously couldn't stand to have them near me.<br>  <br>  Edward is a controlling, abusive, possessive and jealous boyfriend. Here's your real enlightenment. All stupid Twilight fans will just say "He's so hot and perfect!" Bella, is an annoying, whiny and personality deprived sl^t.<br>  <br>  Here:<br>  As a teen girl, the stereotypical Twilight reader, right? Wrong. I admit, I fell in love with the series, then, I don't know. I guess you could say I became wiser, smarter, more intellectual. I completely hated it, everything Bella did soon pissed me off, and Edward wasn't some hot, perfect vampire-oh, no. He was suddenly this abusive, possessive, controlling boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Is that honestly the best message, Stephenie Meyer can tell us? It's okay to have controlling boyfriends-that is, if they sparkle and are hot.<br>  It's okay to get married when your 18, and it's totally fine to have a baby when you're 19. It's just completely going to destroy your life, but, hey, if Meyer says it's okay...<br>  <br>  Pros: Alice Cullen. <br>  Cons: You don't want me to go on.<br>  <br>  I don't know how others see Bella as a role-model, when I perceive her as whiny, ungrateful and just flat out personality deprived. Meyer basically is telling us when we get a boyfriend, we should sneak him into our rooms, and ignore our friends. And when he dumps us, we should so totally not get on with life. Oh, and to keep trying to have sex with him.<br>  <br>  You know what? Edward Cullen isn't real. I'm going to get swarmed by crazed girls screaming "NO! I LOVE HIM! AND HE'S MINE!" or "THE ACTOR IS!" Do you honestly think he's going to pay attention to YOU?<br>  Plus, his hair's messed up.<br>  <br>  He's a friggin' stalker who watches her sleep at night. Who got her almost killed four times.

AqDson6zaa	I like in between, like a thicker paperback cover. ;)<br>  <br>  Honestly it's not paperback or hardcover for me, it's MY copy. You know? Like, I need MY hardback old stained dying copy of Harry Potter, or the particular Cold Mountain that I first read it with, or the 1984 that travels a lot of places with me. Etc. <br>  <br>  And what's on the cover, honestly. A lot of my books have white paper taped over them because I hate the pictures on the front.<br>  <br>  Usually I lean towards buying hardcovers when there's options at the store, unless they're about a million dollars more expensive.|`|27d6fd19ae9c4fc896c24ed094c8929faa	Definitely hardback. But sometimes I cheat & rent it from the library. Then if I really like it I'll buy one for my home library. A really good story to me is worth reading more than once.<br>  <br>  One of my favs The Christ Clone Trilogy by James Beauseigner only comes in paperback. The first one I got for free & loved it so much I bought the next two before I was half way through the first one. I've read them 4 or 5 times. The guy really knows how to write. I wouldn't trade them for hardbacks now because I've grown rather attached to the paperbacks. lol!<br>  <br>  But as a rule I prefer hardbacks.|`|fs9ZjaKmaa	I love to collect, feel, and fondle hardbacks.<br>  <br>  But I love to read paperbacks. I'm weird though and have to make certain I never open them to the point that the spine creases.<br>  <br>  It feels odd to hold a large hardback while reading it.. paperback is just more.. intimate, for lack of a better word.|`|32g69LSZaa	I love them both. I buy books, and take out books from the library. I'll take either...heck, I've gotten books that are completely lacking covers, I've gotten books that were pages in a binder or folder. So long as I have a book, I'm happy ^_^ I love literature.|`|GcKVfvJqaa	personally it doesn't matter to me .....<br>  i would like to have a hard cover or paperback but its not the first thing that comes to mind when i get a book<br>  <br>  But to answer your question......<br>  Hard cover all the way ;)|`|S5xwCthGaa	I prefer paperback, they are lighter so you can carry them around in your bag! so you can read when you get the chance|`|Lz26O1Uvaa	I like paper back =]]<br>  I don't know why, but I like being able to bend the book with my thumb on the edge so I can flip through pages quickly. And they're lighter.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	I don't care in which form they come,I only buy books for the stories they contain.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Classics, somehitng I'm going to back to time and time again, I'll buy the Hard Back - example T.E.Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom.<br>  <br>  For a "throw away" read, then I'll go with the softback, example Frank Herbet's Dune.|`|TlqSAM0naa	I borrow books from the library mostly, not buy..<br>  <br>  I don't like hardback because they're heavier=]jk..but they are bigger && don't fit well in my bag..they do last longer though...<br>  <br>  Paperback rip easy && I don't like how the front cover folds, but I still like them better.<br>  <br>  It's harder to hold open & hardcover book while doing something else, like eating.=]|`|v70p2kgWaa	I use a library so money isn't the issue.  I do not like trade paperback, actually I hate it, they are flimsy and combine what I dislike about hardbacks and paperbacks. However, if it's a good book what can I do?  I'm going to read it anyway.  Otherwise my preference between hardback and mass market paperback is actually 50-50.  I like hardbacks for reading at home and paperback when I out and about.  I enjoy being able to slip paperbacks into my pocket but they are difficult to hold open.  Hardbacks are easy to hold open and I like the weight of them in my hands.  However, they are large, sometimes heavy and a burden to tote around.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	It depends on what it is.  I often go to the used bookstore, or to the book aisles of dollar stores or the local Odd Lots, so I'm often getting paperback books, which is fine.  They're cheaper, and easier to travel with...<br>  <br>  But if it's a book that I don't plan to take somewhere (in other words, one I'm not willing to part with through losing or forgetting to pick it up), I usually like hard covers.  Most of my Stephen King and V.C. Andrews books are hardcovers.  I don't know why...I just love the feel of them, and they smell different...sort of comforting.  Odd, I know.  Plus, as it was mentioned, hardbacks last longer, and I'm rather particular about keeping even my most beloved and read books in good condition.  Paperbacks wear too easily, the cover rips if they fall out of your bag or off your desk, the glue in the binding dries to quickly and causes pages to fall out randomly, and they just aren't as sturdy as a hard back book.<br>  <br>  I hate having paperback text books, though.  It drives me absolutely nuts to open the package from my school bookstore to discover paperback texts.  I do take them to work and where ever I go, but I think it's because I use them more (which tends to wear the pages faster) than my pleasure books.  Sometimes you can't help but slam a text shut out of frustration, and the paperbacks just don't have that satisfactory thud.  lol  Seriously, though...I hate paperback text books because I feel like, as much as text books cost, they should at least put forth the effort of creating them to fit their cost...|`|usvPMtMtaa	hardcover<br>  paperback novels tend to get ruined more easily and you always have to put a really thick book on top after you read to fold out the crease<br>  hardcover seem more professional.. in my opinion|`|H2bFiDNAaa	paperback but i really don't care
dbTPyM7Yaa	100%,<br>  Try a stream of consciousness piece. First, choose your favorite color, mine is purple. Now paint the background a dark shade of that. Think of what your favorite object around the house is (a quirky jug with a frog on top that the water comes out of, for me). <br>  <br>  Next pick a piece of jewelry, and several more objects you love and put them the table. Arrainge them in any way that pleases you. Paint them -by the way, when we use real objects to paint from they are all called models-all in a shade of your favorite color, using the lightest shades for light-reflective surfaces and the darkest shades for shadows. <br>  <br>  Final step: do this painting in 3 hours or less from set-up to put-away. It's a fun challenge, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	Fields of flowers - can be impressionistic, like Monet - doesn't have to be extremely detailed - lots of colors massed together and different shades in each mass of color - if you do it, I want to see!|`|qof2d5ujaa	Why don't you paint a venician carnival mask picture thingy?

3d7xKkUpaa	I've actually noticed more of the 'Twilight vs Twi-haters' a lot more than the Twilight vs Harry Potter. <br>  <br>  I say truce. I'm sick of all the 'questions' about hating Twilight, and the rabid fangirls. Oh and the rabid haters, as well.|`|VsP8t5rbaa	I think the war was ridiculous to begin with. It's impossible to compare the two. The ONLY similarities I see between them is Rob Pattinson appeared in both movies. <br>  <br>  Twilight fans started comparing it to Harry Potter because they were mad their "hawtie" got a minor role and was killed off.<br>  <br>  Anyone with a brain can tell that Harry Potter and Twilight are on two completely different levels, literary wise. Harry Potter being literate, and Twilight being...not....<br>  <br>  They're not even the same genre....|`|3e9Deb1Baa	was there a competition???<br>  well definitely aye<br>  harry potter and twilight are totally different..u cant compare both of them...<br>  harry potter is a fantasy adventure...but twilight is more of a fantasy romance..so theres no point of competition|`|fWbclAxSaa	Aye<br>  Although I am an avid anti-twilighter, I want nothing more than for this idiotic 'war' to stop.<br>  And wtf is with all the twilight/hp impersonators?|`|WGIMIbs5aa	The only entertaining thing about it is the fact there's a "war" in the first place.

4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	A lot.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=how+many+people+died+during+the+crusades%3F" rel="nofollow">http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=how+many+people...</a>|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	It really depends how you count "crusades". Simply because the "crusades" were a tiny piece (100 years) of a huge war (begun in 633 and continued practically to this day). <br>  <br>  If you add the conquest of North Africa, the slave trade done in the name of Jihad (eg the agression of Islam against the Christians kingdoms of Sudan and Ethiopia), the "devshirmeh" child tax and all the battles then the number will come up to several hundred milion people. <br>  <br>  If you add the cost of battles against the non-Christians (Persia, India, Mongols) to the total (it would not count as "Crusade" but definetly a war of religion) then 600 milion dead would probably not be enough. The number might sound huge- but we are talking multiple centuries here.<br>  <br>  Even if you only stick to the Christian-muslim wars you would have to decide if you wante to include the wars over Spain (muslim invasion in 711 AD folowed by the Spanish Reconquista which ended in 1492 AD) into the total- that was also technically a "crusade". Just as was the "crusade" against the Albigean heresy and the "crusades" against the Czech rebellion of Tabor<br>  <br>  If you wish to include just the first expeditions to recover Jerusalem then the numbers lost would be around 200 thousand combatants- roughly evenly divided on both sides. As to civilians anybody's guess- perhaps another 200 thousand- and perhaps many more. No one counted the "peasant's crusade" which was massacred almost to the last man (estimates around 100 thousand) and no one counted the civilians massacred after various towns were taken by storm.
YWjhqlxbaa	They started with the Industrial revolution with the use of railroads. They used railroads to transport stuff. Plus they had awesome natural resources. I'm not sure of what they gained power. But eventually, the Germans caught up to them and eventually beat the English in the second industrial revolution.
d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	As much as I respect Louise's answers, I have to disagree with her here.<br>  <br>  True, it's wrong to think of the Middle Ages as a totally moribund period of history; nevertheless, a great deal that happened during this period as well as in the early Renaissance was a recapturing of past learning.<br>  <br>  Rome created the social, economic, and political stability within which progress could have been fostered. A single unified entity, bringing order would have quickened the pace of learning to a considerable degree.<br>  <br>  Had Rome not fallen I believe western civilization would have progressed much quicker; and computers by the 18th century would not have been impossible. By this time, we would probably be colonizing other planets.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|NYU37jfGaa	No.  There was plenty of progress in technology and invention in the middle ages.  The compass, the mechanical clock, spectacles, printing, gunpowder, the blast furnace, water-powered machinery, Gothic architecture, are among the achievements of the medieval era.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read Frances and Joseph Gies's fascinating book 'Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel' which is all about technology and invetion in the Middle AGes, and is really interesting.  I think we progressed faster, rather than slower, as a result of the fall of the Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  If the Roman empire hadn't fallen, we'd probably still be living in a slave-owning society, without much modern technology, and going to watch criminals being thrown to the lions in the arena.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Doubtful; Roman society was based on slave ownership.One of the main reasons for the relative lack of technological advance,particularly in industrial terms,for thousands of years was slavery. There was often no incentive to invent big machines or labour saving devices because slaves did all the menial and dangerous work.<br>   Once the number of slaves in society declined sufficiently,there was more incentive to invent new things. Slavery declined in Europe first,so Europe gained a technological advantage over other states enabling them to gain vast overseas empires.|`|ApZ0qS88aa	ammianus, While you're absolutely correct in pointing out Rome's dependence on slave ownership as a factor preventing major technical advancement we can presume that most if not all of the major events which precipitated technical leaps forward in the west would have still occurred, the plagues and the little ice age being the most notable. These events placed serious strain on a still unindustrialized society, causing massive labor shortages and for the first time in history placing laborers on the right side of the supply/demand curve. Additionally with the knowledge gained by several hundred years where science was not considered heresy humanity may have been more able to weather that tumultuous period of history.<br>  <br>  On the other hand the social elements that led to the dark age were already in place before the ultimate collapse of the Roman empire(s) as it was largely the influence of the Church, the only surviving remnant of the empire which brought on the dark age.
rOY2J0UAaa	The extent at which the Trojan War is described in the Iliad/ Odyssey/ Aeneid etc is highly unlikely, however there would have obviously been wars between Greeks and Trojans at various times|`|qgs155HNaa	Michael Wood was an "Euhemerist", desiring to reduce the fantastical to real proportions.  He started out looking for history in the Trojan War, and (golly!) he found it.  But the oldest sources for the Trojan War (which is something distinct from 'the city of Troy' or the 'Trojan people') are epical poetry (Homer and his sequels) and drama ("Trojan Women", "Helen", "Agamemnon" etc.etc.).  They are not history.  If they are, then you have to explain the appearances of the gods, the operation of dreams, the "Will of Zeus", etc. etc.  Beyond all that, the destruction of ca. 1250-1200 B.C. does not just involve one city (Troy). Most of the 'palaces' in the Greek world are abandoned or destroyed.  The Hittite Empire in Turkey collapses.  The Old Assyrian Empire is disrupted.  Moses and the Israelites escape from Egypt. etc. etc.  The 'Trojan War' is part of a larger picture of destruction and disorganization.|`|knKVjOE6aa	Well it's true that the ruins of Troy were discovered in Turkey, but whether or not a ten year war was fought for a woman is debatable.|`|sPsItvUjaa	yeah|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, the Greeks were generally at war with someone or other, and some of the events related by Homer etc may be based on a real war.  The site of Troy is said to have been in what is now Turkey, and has been extensively excavated.  There appears to be evidence of the city being destroyed at about the right period.  Whether any of the more interesting details of the story are true or not it is hard to say.  But a Trojan prince could have run off with a Greek queen, and that is just the sort of thing the Greeks would have gone to war over, they were war mad.|`|68ee405bb00c52b1f70ed3481fd154f2aa	yeah I do .. why do you ask?
AA11898755	Always call or e-mail first and ask for their preferred method of receiving images of new artists' works. Never just show up. Negotiation will be limited. Reputable galleries have set standards. The negotiation is largely whether you give them exclusivity and what their commission is.|`|dbTPyM7Yaa	K360,<br>  The formal process used to be that you had a professional photographer take slides of each of your pieces, then take those to gallery owners. Most of us cannot afford that these days, so it's really up to you how you do it. If you have a digital camera you might put together a CD to hand out to gallery owners. <br>  <br>  I have talked to people who just took a piece to a gallery and asked if they could sell it. They did. I personally plan to put all my paintings in the car that will fit and drive to every gallery I need to, and hope they can take a look. Of course, I will go to the galleries ahead of time and get to know the kind of work they feature most, so I know where my work will fit in best.<br>  <br>  You should also know that galleries usually keep 50% of the sales price.|`|Y5QLCEZeaa	Usually galleries have a process or a preferred format for reviewing slides or cd's. I'd just call and ask or check out their website. Often you can find "open submission" dates and details. If you do need slides, you can take digital pics and then go to www.iprintfromhome.com and have them make them into slides and mail them to you. Also keep in mind there are coffeeshops, restaurants, pubs, etc. that also show art sometimes...good luck!
q34vCB3Qaa	me too,but just as long the storyline is complete and doesn't have a lot of sequels like the SAW movies lol|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes I know what you mean, everyone feels that way.|`|zgtVxtgtaa	I totally agree. And it is like loosing a friend because you've invested all these years into the story and when their story ends... well, I'm just never ready.|`|aqmuItyvaa	Yup, I feel sad because I will lose one source of entertainment in my life, and have to seek for another. For me, it's more about books. Especially, when I become a fan of that series. The series ending means I won't know more about the adventures the character goes through anymore|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	Ofcourse. Harry Potter. I really felt bad when it ended.|`|F8OrjeWsaa	yes, i did for twilight, and after harry potter i felt so empty.|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well, I can relate to that. Not as much when the series ends, as when the channel takes it off the air. If it has a happy, "wrap up everything" ending, then I feel satisfied.<br>  <br>  But I love watching ER, and without warning the only channel that shows it around here replaced it with some stupid show called "Ghost Whisperer". They never said anything, and they just did it in the middle of a storyline.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yes, I do feel oddly depressed when a series ends.<br>  <br>  I cried when I finished reading the last Harry Potter book, because I knew that the books were all over.<br>  <br>  I believe when you read a really good series, they stick with you for life, they are always with you and you will alays draw inspiration from them.|`|9NjGMSwkaa	I kinda do,It's like an awesome show and some shows you kind of share personalities with one or multiple of the characters.I was dissapointed when the WB's "TARZAN" ended,after only 8 episodes in the first season! Now that was a letdown,but i guess no show lasts forever.|`|63Ac7vDyaa	Yes! I just read on the Lost website that next years season 6 is the last season and I got hella sad! lol That's kinda pathetic I guess but I really like that show! Its doing really good too, I don't know why they end good shows that have good ratings!?!?|`|jhWFjHTgaa	A little.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if it ends stupidly, then the reason I feel sad has more to do with having wasted my time on it than the fact that it ended.|`|UOPWz06Vaa	Yes, I'm depressed for about a week, but only if i really enjoyed the series.|`|xORLUyVmaa	IM goin to be sad when the tv show scrubs ends.|`|2UtkBvvvaa	Yes, I know exactly what you mean!<br>  I feel like that when I reach the end of a series too =(|`|eAD0ensNaa	It may sound completely rediculous and nerdy but I cried when dragonball z ended...and when final fantasy 7 ended. It's just those things that you dedicate so much time to, and you fall in love with the characters. Having it end...the sense of finality just kills me every time. Exactly like a lost friend. It's like they died practically.

wS3oR0U7aa	Maybe you should just draw a picture.|`|o1woHm1Uaa	Here's what I do. I just write. That's it. I don't bother making it good or using big words or anything. I just write what's in my head. It comes out and it looks like garbage because it's filled with typos and grammatical errors. Once I do that, I take a break for the day. The next day after being well rested, I work on writing again, but this time I edit it more thoroughly and work on being more descriptive. Sometimes I have to rewrite something maybe two or three times before it satisfies me. I do this with a lot of things. That's my advice. Just don't think about it too much and write. You're not going to get something perfect right away.|`|AA12384115	I don't know. Would it help to say your ideas out loud? Maybe tell it to a friend who will write it down?

Here are a few suggestions that may work for you:<br>  <br>  1. Go for a walk.<br>  2. Listen to some music ( apparently wordless music is better)<br>  3. Jack Keroauc once said that if you need to stop and think when writing you are not looking for a word but a clearer picture. Perhaps you need to sit and make your ideas more vivid and clearer.<br>  <br>  There is also an exercise in which you just write. Without thinking, without stopping for the best word, write. Let the unconcsious mind do the work.<br>  <br>  There is a great book called: Becoming a writer. That might help you :D|`|uEjES9Q2aa	I just hate writer's block! I understand what you mean. It might be helpful to keep a pen, or pencil, along with some paper to write on, with you at all times. Even when you're sleeping, keep them near you because you never now when you'll need them.<br>  <br>  You'd need to also clear you mind and relax. Try to organize your thoughts rather than have them scattered.|`|08MBrOuSaa	Creative writing!... ...or sitting in front of your computer/paper for long periods of time contemplating which would be less painful: sitting for a few more minutes or jamming that pencil into your eye and then finally coming up with a good paragraph, before deciding it's crap! tossing it and then starting the process all over again. <br>  <br>  =] You get somewhere eventually, I swear.

AA11172918	Go with Shutterfly, if you're looking for an online photo site. I've beenreally pleased with the results.<br>  <br>  That said, I've had my digital scrapbook pages printed by my local Costco, and they've turned out beautifully, too.
3H0hluVoaa	It changes the color of the background and lighting- the difference of natural lighting, versus all the others.<br>  <br>  Just keep it at auto unless you want a particular one. Experiment.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Setting the white balance tells the camera what the true white point is for the light being used. For example fluorescent lighting can create a slightly greenish tinge to the whites. If your camera "knows" you're shooting in that lighting because you've set the white balance to "fluorescent" it will compensate for the color shift caused by the fluorescent lighting. Then your whites and all colors should look more natural.<br>   <br>  If you do switch your white balance to shoot in different lighting conditions try to always remember to switch it back next time you're shooting. It is so easy to forget about that setting and then end up with dozens of shots taken with the wrong white balance setting.<br>  <br>  If you do make the mistake of shooting with the wrong white balance setting you can do some correction in photoshop to shift the colors in the correct direction again. This can be tedious so it's better to be in the habit of paying close attention to those setting so you won't have to fix things later.|`|v5VlL09iaa	Only to simplify the other answers;<br>  white is the combination of all of the other colors of the spectrum. So if your camera knows what white is supposed to be it will be able to tell what all of the other colors are supposed to be.|`|mAfvLMa7aa	Because of different lighting conditions, like artificial light and sunsets, white things often don't look white in a photograph. White balance attempts to adjust a photograph so that it looks white.|`|JFhoaxZjaa	its daylight|`|C77c0OE2aa	Good answers already, but it may still seem to make no sense to you WHY such a thing even exists. Simply, light does have "temperature" expressed as degrees Kelvin. Our brain is quite a bit more capable than your camera! Our brain compensates for these various light temperatures so that we see white the same in all lighting conditions. The camera is just not that smart, though the AUTO white balance setting is trying to do that. In most cases, you are much better off to set the white balance in the camera to the lighting condition. Best yet, is to do a custom white balance in a particular light, but your camera may not allow this.<br>  <br>  steve|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Auto lets the camera decide what kind of lighting is being used to light the scene ... that mode can be easily fooled.<br>  <br>  Daylight is for shooting in bright sun, shade for shooting in shade, cloudy for shooting on over cast days, incandescent for shooting in doors under incandescent lighting, fluorescent for shooting in fluorescent lighting in addition there is sometimes a setting for actual colour temperature in degrees Kelvin.<br>  <br>  Horizon?  don't have a clue .. what camera and model are you taking about?
uPVnqbE8aa	Well, well, well.  I have to say that you are one damn good photographer.  I am VERY impressed.  Your wildlife and natural history images are outstanding.  The way you combined unrelated things like the snake and the shoes is really great.<br>  You have a really, really good eye.  You MUST continue in photography.  This "IS" your career.  Take every school course you can in photography, at all levels.  Also, study hard in your Biology courses, because it looks like you have a love for nature too.  The more you know about your subjects the better a photographer you'll be.<br>  I did not have time to look at all your images, but the only criticism I can give you is that your weakness lies in the images of the girl.  If that's you, you are very pretty, but do not get carried away with self portraits.  Or, be far more selective when choosing which ones you think make a statement and which ones are just so so.  <br>  If you are not afraid to do so, please email me now and then and let me see some more of your shots.<br>  Keep up the good work.  You ARE a photographer.  What you've got to do now, other than get a good education in photography, is to get a really good camera, like a Nikon D3.  You deserve it, so save for it.<br>  Good luck and be happy in your work.|`|dbTPyM7Yaa	Most of your photos are excellent. My personal favorites were the pink Calla Lillies -your ability to capture the subtelty of the flowers is wonderful.  My only recommendation is take lots of shots of each subjects so you can choose only the best ones of the group.Keep going!|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	I looked at all your photos... i think you do good work overall... I see you like textures<br>  Some shots can use less zoom... but are still good shots<br>  your photos are definitely  refreshing <br>  Keep up the good work|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Your composition is stronger (much better use of Rule of Thirds, etc), and your exposure has improved a bit. I like "Heartfelt"- the soft focus and extremely shallow DOF work really well. I think you've got a good grasp on technique, etc; I'd advise going in a more artistic direction, away from 'capturing reality' and into making photographs as an artistic statement. There's an amazing Canadian photographer who excels at abstract and impressionist work:<br>  <a href="http://www.freemanpatterson.com/books.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freemanpatterson.com/books.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Even the covers of a few of these books show what he's capable of.  Click on the book "Photo Impressionism' and you'll see samples of what I mean- and he does this work with film, in camera as he shoots, using mastery of technique- NOT through digital manipulation. A VERY gifted and creative photographer who is also a great teacher and writer. Your library might have some of his books.|`|XKhNw221aa	It seems about the same, except for the two with the snakes and shoes. The rest are just there they are photo's. Technique wise, don't zoom in as much, and take the photo of the subject as though it's not suppose to be the center of attention, if you know what I'm saying. And remember, it's not what camera you use, it how you view the world.

I think people are blinded by the fantasy of the perfect guy, Edward, and don't see that the plot REALLy isn't that great. People compare Twilight to Harry Potter . . . HA! Yeah, right.

InAICv25aa	I loved it too! <br>  <br>  For some reason, though, I knew what was wrong with Jenny's life, but I somehow couldn't really sympathize with her. It seemed she was waaay depressed for not much bad things. I mean, she's fed, she doesn't suffer from physical abuse, she's loved (okay, a stifling kind of love, but still loved). <br>  <br>  One of my favorite scenes is when Mr. Brown stands out there and wonders if he lost his muse, and that's when Helen just left.

d1ylRSSCaa	What makes a dance good is simply the choreography. What makes you a good dancer is your personality (and a little technique helps). I'm really big on facial expressions, and when I see someone who's really getting into a dance I just love it. <br>  <br>  If you can get your audience into your dance, like pumping them up or even making them laugh (in the right way) it will your performance stand out and more memorable. <br>  <br>  As for drama, I'm assuming you have a monologue. Just go to the mirror and perfect it. It's really not that hard, just make sure you can convince yourself because otherwise you've got no chance convincing someone else that you mean what you say. <br>  <br>  I have a simple method for drama, it goes: Mirror, perfect, change, perfect the change, repeat. <br>  It's golden.

Jesus Christ is simply another myth -- he never existed.  There are no records made by the Romans during his supposed "rabble-rousing" that even mention the guy.  All other "evidence" is merely circular -- the one referring to the next that refers back to the first one.  This is hardly "evidence".  Need I explain it more thoroughly?

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?|`|AFjLCinGaa	Check out a couple of these series:<br>  Black Dagger Brotherhood by: J.R.

OilQvoLZaa	The part where Vermeer decides Griet must wear the pearl earrings, even though it will ruin her, and he could just imagine her wearing them, or leave them out of the painting.

Twilight is just a 13 year old girls fantasy and Romeo and  Juliet isn't even actually a story about love; it's a story about lust. Most people don't seem to get that. Think about it. Two kids meet each other and start kissing after about 20 seconds. The next day they get married. A few days later they kill themselves over each other. They don't even know each other and they're dying for each other! What kind of love is that? Sounds like every teenage relationship ever. In the end though, Romeo and Juliet has a good lesson so it's better than Twilight of course.<br>  <br>  By the way, you're all idiots for actually giving a f u c k about this. Get a life and get off the internet you losers. There's more to life than stating over and over how much you hate Twilight. We get it. Nobody with any intelligence actually cares. Build a damn bridge and get the hell over it already.|`|e30a9e9e5716e986b609ef9728d116ccaa	Twilight has nothing to do with Romeo and Juliet. Not a remake. Twilight is zero on the literary scene. It's never gonna be a classic(even if the fans force their children to read it and so on as a family tradition). It's just a fashion and it will go away. Juliet is not a weirdo, and Romeo is not an abusive perverted pedophile boyfriend(fangirl: omg omg ed cullen i love you i want a boy just like you..) lucky for the girls, there are no such boys. they'll grow up. You have to be crazy and obsessed to think that a thrash like this chic-lit can be any match to a classic drama.|`|Yr8mWzS8aa	I usually LOVE Shakespeare but I HATE, HATE, HATE Romeo and Juliet.

AHJQfHx9aa	Lovely round of gibberish.  <br>  <br>  If you are curious, the apple is attributed to the story by John Milton in the epic poem "Paradise Lost."<br>  <br>  The bible itself is never more specific than just saying "fruit," what the fruit is thought to symbolize changes drastically from tradition to tradition.|`|9UvkRIdraa	First of all, It's Genesis, and Satan. Watch your spelling.  And it took me too long to decipher your paragraph that I now have no time to "Decipher Kane" and whatever else you were asking. Wow.<br>  <br>  But anyway good luck...|`|T7Mb8deyaa	I think that the fruit they ate was Satan's lie. They ate it, believed it, swallowed it. The lie was that God could not be trusted, but that Satan could be trusted. Therefore, they became willing to do whatever Satan told them. They then were not children of God, but now children of Satan. <br>  <br>  Evergreen means ever living, living forever, full of life, everlasting life. It refers to abundance of life we have when we trust God.<br>  <br>  The fig leaves represent our seperation from God. We are no longer His children, instead we run and hide from Him. We feel ashamed. This is the direct result of not trusting in God in the first place. So now we are afraid of God. When before, He was our Father. <br>  <br>  Adam and eve did not have sex, but they did have one mind. They were unified together in their love and trusting of God. That was where their unity came from- not sex.|`|7IjGzvqTaa	I can honestly say that I understood very little of that paragraph.  So I'll basically just reiterate what Genesis really says.<br>  <br>  As far as what fruit they ate, there is no clear description of what fruit actually exists on the Tree of Knowledge.  It is most generally associated with an apple because it is the first fruit that most children become associated with early in life.  Ask them to name a fruit, and they'll generally say apple.  Most people then, knowing that they indeed ate some sort of fruit, grow up simply believing that it was the fruit they were first associated with; the apple.<br>  <br>  And it's spelled 'Satan,' not 'Satin.'<br>  <br>  "So Satin Symbolizes the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil So they Had Sex!"<br>  <br>  ...There is so much wrong with that sentence, and I'm not even referring to the grammar.  Although it doesn't help.<br>  <br>  Satan doesn't symbolize the Tree of Knowledge; Satan symbolizes the temptation of man.  After Adam and Eve both consumed the fruit from the Tree, they didn't have sex.  They merely noticed that they were nude, and they were ashamed of their nakedness.  They were no longer innocent because they had eaten from the Tree of Knowledge; if they know what good and evil are, then their innocence has left them.<br>  <br>  And by Kane, I assume you are referring to Cain and Abel?  There's little to "decipher" about them; Cain and Abel offered to God the fruit they had grown and the sheep they had herded respectively, and God smiled on Abel's offering, but not on Cain's.  Cain symbolizes jealousy, as he kills his brother out of envy.<br>  <br>  I, erm, hope that helped clear things up for you, at least a little.
C77c0OE2aa	I've beat my head against this wall many times myself when people continue to use the word "photoshop" instead of EDIT or adjust or manipulate or whatever.

I'm a little fed up with everyone trying to use it as a verb too.  It sounds ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to be much more specific about what kind of editing you want.  Saying you want the picture "photoshopped" isn't enough information.  Do you want to adjust the saturation, the color temperature, the contrast, etc?  How much editing do you want, and what kind of editing?  That will determine what kind of image editing program you might need...whether a basic program might work, or whether you will need a more sophisticated (and expensive) program like Adobe Photoshop, Aperture, etc.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	"Photoshop" is the name of a commercial application designed by Adobe.

TbTO5SXlaa	First, you should have a UV/Haze filter on your lens. I suggest one in a "thin" or "slim" mount" to prevent possible vignetting at 18mm. Choose from Hoya, B+W, Singh-Ray, Tiffen or Heliopan. <br>  <br>  You should also be using the lens hood made for your lens. The hood will prevent stray light from causing lens flare.<br>  <br>  You should also carry your circular polarizer.<br>  <br>  If you want better landscapes when shooting on the ground, use a tripod. This allows you to use a lower ISO and a smaller f-stop. You can use the camera's self-timer to release the shutter. With my camera on a tripod, I use ISO 100 and a 21mm lens at f16. I know, from experience, that if I focus my 21mm lens at 6 feet at f16 everything from 2' 2" to infinity will be in focus. If you'd like to compute depth of field for your lens at various focal lengths and f-stops just go to: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html</a>|`|j5Apt8hWaa	At 18 mm, you will be able to get excellent landscape shots, but for really amazing landscape's, you will eventually want the Nikon 12-24 mm f/4.

Shakespeare said "Journeys end in lovers meeting." What an extraordinary thought. Personally, I have not experienced anything remotely close to that, but I am more than willing to believe Shakespeare had. I suppose I think about love more than anyone really should. I am constantly amazed by its sheer power to alter and define our lives. It was Shakespeare who also said "love is blind". Now that is something I know to be true. For some quite inexplicably, love fades; for others love is simply lost. But then of course love can also be found, even if just for the night. And then, there's another kind of love: the cruelest kind. The one that almost kills its victims. It's called unrequited love. Of that I am an expert. Most love stories are about people who fall in love with each other. But what about the rest of us? What about our stories, those of us who fall in love alone? We are the victims of the one sided affair. We are the cursed of the loved ones. We are the unloved ones, the walking wounded. The handicapped without the advantage of a great parking space! Yes, you are looking at one such individual. And I have willingly loved that man for over three miserable years! The absolute worst years of my life! The worst Christmas', the worst Birthday's, New Years Eve's brought in by tears and valium. These years that I have been in love have been the darkest days of my life. All because I've been cursed by being in love with a man who does not and will not love me back. Oh god, just the sight of him! Heart pounding! Throat thickening! Absolutely can't swallow! All the usual symptoms. I understand feeling as small and as insignificant as humanly possible. And how it can actually ache in places you didn't know you had inside you. And it doesn't matter how many new haircuts you get, or gyms you join, or how many glasses of chardonnay you drink with your girlfriends... you still go to bed every night going over every detail and wonder what you did wrong or how you could have misunderstood. And how in the hell for that brief moment you could think that you were that happy. And sometimes you can even convince yourself that he'll see the light and show up at your door. And after all that, however long all that may be, you'll go somewhere new. And you'll meet people who make you feel worthwhile again. And little pieces of your soul will finally come back. And all that fuzzy stuff, those years of your life that you wasted, that will eventually begin to fade.|`|AA10981338	I'm Not that Girl- Wicked

ZB9zkbxxaa	Mahatma Gandhi<br>  <br>  Mohandas Karamchand "Mahatma" Gandhi was perhaps the most influential person of the 20th Century, yet, he held no office or title, and possessed no wealth. Mahatma Gandhi's Influence and accomplishments were largle responsible for India's Indepence from Britian. He won no elections, and claimed no scientific discoveries or inventions. His legacy, a philosophy of nonviolence and non-cooperation, continues to this day with an profound effect on the world. It was the inspiration for Martin Luther King's fight for racial equality. This is the Gandhi about whom Albert Einstein wrote, "Generations to come, it may be, will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth"<br>  <br>  When he died at the hand of Nathuram Godsey, a fanatic Hindu on Jan. 30, 1948, he left behind just a handful of possessions. But the real inheritance he left to humanity was something more substantial--a legacy of nonviolence.

C77c0OE2aa	Combining two or more photos into a single photo is actually very simple. Imagine having actual prints of your photos and say they are 8 inches width x 10 inches height in size. Then imagine laying out a piece of paper large enough to hold each print. If you wanted to place the photos side by side, you would need a sheet of paper that would be twice as wide as your prints, so you would need a sheet 16 inches wide by 10 inches high. If you wanted to place the photos on top of each other, you would need a sheet of paper twice as high as your photos, so that would be a piece of paper 20 inches high and 8 inches wide.<br>  <br>  You will do the same thing in the computer. In Photoshop or GIMP <a href="http://www.gimp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org</a> you will go to FILE - NEW and enter the dimensions of you new "canvas size". You can either do this in inches or pixels or any other unit of measure. There is a drop down list beside the size boxes where you can select units of measure. Again, you will create a new canvas that is large enough to contain your photos you want to place into it. You will need to know the exact size of your photos. You can go to IMAGE - SIZE and see the dimensions of your photos and then from those numbers you will know how large to make your new canvas.<br>  <br>  Be SURE, however, when you are creating your new canvas, that you set the resolution (DPI) to the same number as your original photos, otherwise there will be a huge size difference between your new canvas and the photos you drop into it.<br>  <br>  You can also make the new canvas larger than your photos if you want to add borders or a different color background or text or design embellishment. Only your skill and imagination are the limiting factors as to what you can do.<br>  <br>  steve

KBBonf97aa	An acoustic-electric guitar is still an acoustic guitar, except that it has a pickup (microphone) built into it so you can plug it into a guitar amplifier of a PA system as you would an electric guitar.  It plays exactly the same as an acoustic, but has the ability to be amplified without the need for an external microphone.<br>  <br>  If you're just getting started playing guitar, you probably don't have much need for an acoustic-electric.  But if you become a good guitarist and want to play shows in coffeehouses or clubs, you'll probably want to use a guitar that can be "plugged in."  If you find yourself in that position in a few years, you don't necessarily have to upgrade to an acoustic electric.  There are several companies that manufacture pickups that can be mounted on your acoustic guitar's soundhole, effectively giving you the same ability to plug it into a PA system as you'd have with an acoustic-electric guitar.  Here's a link to one of those, in case you're curious:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://accessories.musiciansfriend/com/product/Duncan-Performer-Maverick-Soundhole-Pickup?sku=300132" rel="nofollow">http://accessories.musiciansfriend/com/p...</a>|`|HxHvhZAsaa	well an electric is the same, it can be plugged into an amp is the only difference. buy cheap? youll be buying again. buy once|`|4bScKxo0aa	An acoustic electric guitar will have a built-in pickup (kinda a "microphone for guitars") ... that enables it to be hooked up to an amplifier or speaker system.<br>  <br>  Acoustic guitar is pure acoustic. If you need to hook it up to a speaker/PA system, you'll have to position an external microphone at the sound hole.

Ofzyh1VJaa	Well, there are different types of cramping.. some good and some not so good. But, since you say that the cramps are really painful that definitely means that there's something wrong. You could be getting a mild/severe form of tendinitis in your foot. I'm not exactly sure where you're feeling the cramps but often it happens on the outside tendon running along the side of your foot, under your foot in your arch, or running on the top of your foot (from where your toes connect all the way to where your foot connects to your ankle).Tendinitis is not something to be taken lightly and I would definitely urge you to go see a doctor/physical therapist who can give you exercises to correct it or at least make it more bearable.  Another cause could be that you're sickling your feet when you point which would cause your arch to cramp up. In any case, I just suggest that you see a physical therapist because you won't really know what is wrong until you consult an expert.<br>  <br>  Remember, no matter what your teacher says, any kind of cramping that is painful to you is your body's way of letting you know that something is not right and that, is NOT a good thing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

You may also benefit from using a pinkie ball. you can find them a dance shops, on line etc. It just a small softish ball 1 inch or so but has nubby things all over it.

K1HnQAZFaa	There really isn't a safe way to instruct you to do this unless you go to a vocal teacher. Pushing for it may produce the sound but is ultimately HORRIBLE for your voice.  The best advice I can give you is to relax your neck and throat as much as possible. Tension is not your friend, however much you may think it is.<br>  <br>  I would suggest looking for a 'mixed' tone. It's somewhere between your head voice and your chest belt. Play around with your voice and see what comes of it.|`|XTfr3uKQaa	What is wrong with going into your head voice? Even pop singers go into their headvoice all the time when they're singing in their upper range. Just use your headvoice for gosh sakes.

Photography is always popular, & again, can be applied toward so many things online, or in other areas.  Salaries vary wildly, so you have to have a specific area in mind (magazines, fashion, etc.) & go from there.  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
RrvJ99uaaa	Motive One: Othello's Affair with Emilia<br>        Iago’s first possible motive that is revealed early in the play is the idea that Othello has slept with Emilia:  <br>  <br>  <br>  “I hate the Moor,<br>  <br>      And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets<br>  <br>      He has done my office.” (Act 1 scene 3)
AA11485682	Yes. Many movies have novelizations made of them, where someone watches the movie and writes a novel based on it. Likewise, there are many cases where movies get sequels or continuation in novel format. Star Wars is a major example, as there are tons of novels that continue the story of Luke, Leia and Han Solo after the events of the movies.|`|v70p2kgWaa	Yes there are several including Blade and Speed (off the top of my head).  There are also ones based off of TV shows like Charmed, Smallville, Buffy, Angel, etc.|`|586cf98e33911260d92c882433b86fbcaa	I don't think it happens quite that way - I think the novelist gets the script and writes from that. There are usually changes to the film that the novelist isn't involved in, hence the 'extra scenes' most movie novelisations have :)<br>  <br>  Plenty of shows have associated books, but they aren't usually written by people involved in the film.
31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamiya" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamiya</a><br>  <br>  Knock off the lens designation as well as the back and the prism.  Mamiya has manufactured many versions of the 645.<br>  <br>  The 80, for example is the lens that is on the camera.  120 designates the back, but those that have the capacity to shoot 120/220 have two different backs for them.  <br>  <br>  I don't know about the prisms for the older ones, but for the TL, for instance, they have two prisms - one non metered and one metered.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking to buy one, the basic lens you would need would be the 80mm f2.8.  The 70mm would work well enough, but if it has leaf shutters, it will cost more.  <br>  <br>  If you want a combination of lenses, and it is a SRL with interchangable lenses, I would recommend the 50 (or 55), the 80, and either the 150 or the 180.  That will cover most bases.  <br>  <br>  It appears to me that you are looking on eBay.  Look instead at www.keh.com, medium format, Mamiya M645 and then order what you need separately rather than getting someone else's camera that has only one lens.  The 45mm is too wide for many circumstances, but it is a very good lens.
VsP8t5rbaa	I'm going to slighty modify your list a little. I'm not sure if you intended them to be in order, but I'm going to change that around too.<br>  <br>  1. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (I've never read a book as many times as this one. My copies are worn to pieces, and I have to say I'm not a very good book owner. I have my pages dog-eared and my favorite parts highlighted. In highschool, this story was my life. Holden's excuses were my excuses. J.D. Salinger also ruined me as a writer. I only had one English professor in college who appreciated my papers. He was a genius and a nice man, and he didn't judge me too harshly. Everyone else told me that my writing was too much like Salinger's and I needed to be more professional. I didn't care. That was the greatest compliment they could have ever given me.)<br>  <br>  2. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien (This gets #2 because of the sheer amount of times I've read these stories. And how much of a cult hit they have become. I know that a work of literature being a cult hit shouldn't be a reason why it's one of the greatest novels of all time, but I think LOTR is the exception.)<br>  <br>  3. 1984 by George Orwell (This book gets a lot of attention, but I'm afraid to deserves even more. It took me a while to decide whether to give it the number 2 slot or not.)<br>  <br>  4. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (An amazing story. Timeless.)<br>  <br>  5. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy (I took War and Peace off the list because I really didn't think it was fair for Tolstoy to have duplicates if Vonnegut couldn't. That's right. Tolstoy gets no special treatment. And I enjoyed Anna Karenina more. I've read it quite a few times, whereas I had to push myself through War and Peace.)<br>  <br>  6. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov (Amazing. I only read it once, and I'm afraid once isn't enough, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.)<br>  <br>  7. Slaughterhouse-five by Kurt Vonnegut (I had to fight with myself to keep from putting more Vonnegut novels on this list. They're all amazing, but I decided to go with Slaughterhouse. It doesn't get much better.)<br>  <br>  8. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (I'm having doubts about where I put this on the list, but I just enjoyed the others more. I've read them more times.)<br>  <br>  9. Catch- 22 by Joseph Heller (This book should be on the top 10 list forever. No matter what. End of argument.)<br>  <br>  10. Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand (I'm seriously considering bumping this one up on the list. It's amazing. I think it's really lame and cliched to say something like this, but I don't care: This book changed my life after reading it.)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You're right. I didn't mention Huckleberry Finn. I have read all (or most, not really sure) of Mark Twain's work, I just simply forgot to include it. 10 is such a small number...<br>  <br>  I haven't read One Hundred Years of Solitude though, but I definitely will.

4Ix12UmTaa	I am quite certain that I can help you with this. I started playing the trombone when I was a junior and I switched to bass trombone in my senior year when I went on to win 1st chair in the all-state competition.  The two keys that you have mentioned are fine. What I found helpful was using resustence like athleates do to train their muscles. Things that worked for me is practicing on your mouthpeice alone. It's helpful to place a part of your finger at the end of the mouth price as to not use up the air supply too quickly. I "pinched tone" is an uncentered tone to begins with. Start with simple scales in very long tones. Pay careful attention to intonation. The reason for this is if the embouchere is playing the note out of tune or even a different note, it will sound pinched. Practice long tones repetitively. At all volumes espessially forte's and above. Piano to forte and back to forte helps a great deal as well as in reverse. Keep in mind that the note must stay in tune troughout each extreame in dynamic. Next, nothing helps like breath support. I spoke of resistance earlier. If you have a mute, after practicing alone with the mouthpiece. Place a cloth or rag around the mute a place it into the bell. Use your diaphram muscles and play loudly at this point. While doing so concentrate on what the diaphram is  doing. This I cannot tell you. You must also do flexibility exercises in each position. Not only from one harmonic seriese direction. For example. B flat f b to d f and so on. Try b flat f to d above staff and just make up your own. Notice how the position of your tongue plays a role in this. That is where the possibilities of lip trills come in. An east ok is between d above staff to f. Y will find that you can do trills faster than woodwind or valve instrument can.This helps with range also plus mouthpiece practice . With the mouth piece start on your lowest not and "glissando to the top of your register and back down. If or if u do not have an F attatchment my point will be proved by layind the notes below the bass clef staff below e. Play the e flat somewhere between 3rd and 4rth position. D in 5th etc. Using no extension or trigger. If your lips a vibration the pitch of that note it will sound, even in tune if you do do it that way.Here are some basics, it is ip to you now. Most do not  get this kind of information at all so you now have a huge chance at immense success. Within only a year and a half I had a range from d 2 octaves below bass clef staff to a g two octaves above the staff. That 4 and a half octaves on a bass trombone with the largest mouthpiece ever made. Schelkie 60. They said my sound was so powerful that even. In in the back of the auditorium. There was so much power it litteraly felt that thier face was being pushed back into their chair. I could also play 3 note chords all be myself. 1 person 3 notes of the chord.if u woulld like more info contact me al gregorysifyeanted@ ya hooil. .|`|AA10827567	Hey bud.

VsP8t5rbaa	Ok, first of all, people are saying Ron deserves to be in Gryffindor because of his loyalty, but HUFFLEPUFF is the house of loyalty. "You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal,"<br>  <br>  I think that Ron should have been in Hufflepuff more than any other house. He was LOYAL to Harry, but it took a LOT of convincing from Harry and Hermione for him to really be brave (in most cases). He mainly just whined and complained a lot. It was his loyalty that kept him going, not his bravery.<br>  <br>  As far as Hermione, she would have been really great in Ravenclaw, but I think she exemplifies a true Gryffindor as well, since she put her neck on the line for Harry and Ron way too many times. Hermione was just a really well rounded person. <br>  <br>  <br>  I think they all deserved Gryffindor to a certain extent because they CHOSE to stand beside Harry, when they could have easily run away.<br>  <br>  Harry deserved to be in Gryffindor the most, because he really doesn't fit in any other house. Hermione would have made a good Ravenclaw, Ron would have made a good Hufflepuff, but Harry was Gryffindor through and through. He went to his own death (at least that's what he thought) with his head held high, and no matter what, he ENDURED everything that happened to him his whole life. And he just ACCEPTED it too, with no question. It was just "This is how it has to be". I love that about Harry, even if he isn't my favorite character.<br>  <br>  For those who argue that Ron was best suited for Gryffindor because his whole family was in it...well Sirius proved that it doesn't really matter, didn't he? He was in Gryffindor when his whole family was in Slytherin.<br>  <br>  Also, about Harry being in Slytherin, that would have NEVER worked. Harry Potter doesn't have the qualities of Slytherin. Voldemort's soul IN Harry had the qualities of Slytherin. The Sorting Hat couldn't tell. It was Voldemort who was confusing the hat.<br>  <br>  My last two arguments are this: 1) Apparently the hat is infallible, so they all belong in Gryffindor. To be literal.<br>  <br>  2) The houses are a good way to keep the school organized and provide for good incentive in competition and sports (since Hogwarts is intramural) but I think the way they're sorted is ridiculous, since people aren't black and white. People possess more than ONE quality, and as such shouldn't be characterized/stereotyped because of ONE quality)<br>  <br>  Ok...I think I'm done. That seems like a rant, but it really wasn't. I just had a lot to say. There's a difference.|`|IrfbapHAaa	YOU ARE A DUCHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|sCehoTIsaa	harry the most as he was brave and honest as the sorting hat said. Hermione should have being in ravenclaw though.|`|InAICv25aa	I think Hermione should have been in Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw is the place for smarties and geniuses, right? If Gryffindor is about courage, then I think Ron probably fits pretty well with that. He whines and complains and jokes around, but when the time comes, you can count on him jumping to defend you. The thing, I really can't see Ron in anything but Gryffindor. In my opinion, he really portrays the ideals of that house: loyal and brave, but not super bright.<br>  <br>  I think it was mentioned in the books that Harry could have easily been in Slytherin, but he chose not to be. So in an alternate kind of situation, the three may have been put in this order:<br>  <br>  Ron - Gryffindor<br>  Hermione - Ravenclaw<br>  Harry - Slytherin|`|586cf98e33911260d92c882433b86fbcaa	In the books, Harry nearly became a Slytherin - and didn't Hermione confess that the hat nearly put her in Ravenclaw?<br>  <br>  That only leaves Ron, who Rowling never mentions as being considered for any house except Gryffindor.|`|qeeem2giaa	the houses are bullshit anyways, didn't they <br>  <br>  --SPOILER--<br>  <br>  abolish them in the last book?|`|h2m6yJ7gaa	All of the Weasleys have been Gryffindors.  Nothing else would do.<br>  <br>  Hermione is the proto-typical Gryffindor, modeled on Jo herself.<br>  <br>  Harry wanted to be in Gryffindor, at least "not Slytherin" as he told the sorting hat.  Because of who he was and the author's prerogative Harry was always going to be a Gryffindor.<br>  <br>  In the end they all exemplified the positive traits embodied by Gryffindor.<br>  <br>  Maybe Hufflepuff for the boys and Ravenclaw for Hermione.  That's a good point to start a story....|`|NqXOtX6Iaa	In my opinion, Harry definitely deserved to be in Gryffindor more than any of them. He is exactly what the Sorting Hat describes as a Gryffindor. He is brave, trustworthy, honest and caring. And he always does the right thing and tries to helpe everyone.<br>  <br>  I think Hermione could have also been in Ravenclaw because she's so smart. Ron should have been in Gryffindor because when it came down to it he was very brave.|`|jbE1iUiyaa	Actually i think the opposite. Hermione would most likely have been chosen for ravenclaw because they are chosen for their brains. if you notice, she is always apprehensive about joining in the adventure but always some type of intellectual solution to their problem. Ron is not that intelligent but he is defenitely ALWAYS there for harry when he needs him, no matter what.|`|3e9Deb1Baa	i think tht harry was the most deserving one to go to gryffindor,,,hermione was more of a ravenclaw,,eith her brilliant mind.<br>  harry is loyal,brave and clever so he is a true gryffindor<br>  ron does not deserve to be in any house...neither is he brave,,so no gryffindor,,neither is he hardworking so no hufflepuff<br>  he is not intelligent so no ravenclaw...neither is he wicked..so no slytherine!!|`|Mj0BA4Yvaa	RavenClaws are the super-geniuses, Gryffindors are the jocks, Slytherins are the preppy jerk rich kids and Hufflepuffs are the regular students.<br>  <br>  I think Hermoine should have been in Ravenclaw, Ron should have been in Hufflepuff and Harry could have either been in Slytherin or Gryffindor.|`|siT2GcULaa	You are right Harry should be in Slytherins
2Ko12Elfaa	literary fiction<br>  <br>  More specifically, the first two are coming of age stories (aka bildungsroman).  Wuthering Heights is vaguely gothic.  The problem I think you're going to have is that, with the exception of To Kill a Mockingbird, you've basically chosen books that have the same plot situation.|`|InAICv25aa	Um... Genre? Or period they were written in?<br>  <br>  They're all Fiction, Classics. <br>  <br>  To Kill a Mockingbird:<br>  20th Century American Literature, it discusses topics like race and prejudices in 1930s Southern American, as well as childhood innocence.<br>  <br>  Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights:<br>  English Literature Classics. Romance is a pretty  important part here. <br>  <br>  Jane Eyre: Story about an orphan growing up and finding love, early 19th century. Poverty is discussed more than the other two and some pretty gruesome scenes of children dying of preventable sicknesses at the very beginning that had me in tears. Very devout and lots of Christian virtue things happening. In the end, because she refuses to cave in to temptation, she is rewarded. You know the story.<br>  <br>  Pride and Prejudice: Practically no religion here. Light chick-flick of the time, THE romantic novel: Elizabeth Bennet meets handsome rich guy, but pride and prejudice, i.e. attitude problems from the guy vs. wagging tongue from the girl keeps them apart until the very end. Good depiction of social values in "The Gentry" of the time. Late 18th century?<br>  <br>  Wuthering Heights: Written later than Pride and Prejudice, somewhere early-mid 19th century. While the first two could be considered fluffly (P&P) and stuffy (J.E.), Wuthering Heights is definitely neither. Emotions of the darker side runs rampant and this is all about revenge, bitterness, and finally love and redemption. Not recommended if you're looking for an easy read. <br>  <br>  I'll list the books by easiness of reading:<br>  To Kill a Mockingbird < Pride and Prejudice < Jane Eyre < Wuthering Heights. <br>  <br>  Jane Eyre is longer and has more complex language than Wuthering Heights, but the topic matter in Wuthering Heights is more challenging. The two might be a tie, though.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	To Kill a Mockingbird: I'd assign it to American Realism, though it was written too late to really belong to that genre.<br>  <br>  The other three would be British Victorian.
inZ9CWBiaa	What you read (see, hear, encounter in any way) goes first into your short term memory. Lots goes in there. If you don't have any other associations with it, it is likely to get lost. This is why it is so important to review what you learn regularly and often. The other way that you can remember is if there is a strong emotion attached to it. A different part of your brain processes this. I used to know the different parts, but I've forgotten them (lol).

Ftkr9jqYaa	William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (February 23, 1868 – August 27, 1963) was an American civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, sociologist, historian, author, and editor. At the age of 95, in 1963, he became a naturalized citizen of Ghana.  Dubois wrote many books, including three major autobiographies.  In 1897, he began writing about criminology, or the sociology of crime, shortly after receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard.<br>  <br>  Du Bois was the most prominent intellectual leader and political activist on behalf of African Americans in the first half of the twentieth century. A contemporary of Booker T. Washington, he carried on a dialogue with the educator about segregation, political disfranchisement, and ways to improve African American life. He was labeled "The Father of Pan-Africanism."<br>  <br>  Along with Washington, Du Bois helped organize the "N e g r o exhibition" at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris.<br>  <br>  W. E. B. Du Bois was involved in religion, studied Baptist churches, and contributed to the sociological study of religion.<br>  <br>  Du Bois was an outspoken opponent of the eugenics and scientific racism of his day. Along with cultural anthropologist Franz Boas, Du Bois argued extensively against the then prevalent notion that African-Americans were biologically inferior to whites.<br>  <br>  Du Bois was one of a number of African-American leaders investigated by the FBI, which claimed in May 1942 that "his writing indicates him to be a socialist". He was chairman of the Peace Information Center at the start of the Korean War, and among the signers of the Stockholm Peace Pledge, which opposed the use of nuclear weapons.  In 1950, at the age of 82, Du Bois ran for the U.S. Senate on the American Labor Party ticket in New York and received four percent of the vote. Although he lost, Du Bois remained committed to the progressive labor cause. In 1958, he would join with Trotskyists, ex-Communists and independent radicals in proposing the creation of a united left-wing coalition to challenge for seats in elections for the New York State Senate and Assembly.<br>  <br>  ***************************<br>  <br>  Booker Taliafero Washington (April 5, 1856 – November 14, 1915) was an American educator, orator, author and leader of the African-American community. He was freed from slavery as a child, and after working at several menial jobs in West Virginia, earned his way through an education at Hampton Institute and Wayland Seminary. Upon recommendation of Hampton founder Sam Armstrong, as a young man, he was appointed as the first leader of the new Tuskegee Institute, then a teachers' college for blacks. Washington filled this role from the opening of the school in 1881 until his death in 1915.<br>  <br>  Washington’s 1895 Atlanta Exhibition address was viewed as an “revolutionary moment” by both African-Americans and whites across the country. He was supported by W.E.B. Du Bois at the time, but years later the two had a falling out due to difference in direction over the remedy required to reversing disenfranchisement. After the falling out, Dubois and his supporters took to erroneously referring to the Atlanta Exposition speech as the "Atlanta Compromise" speech to illustrate their belief that Washington was too accommodating to white interests.  Dubois' views were much more radical than Washington's, since he thought that full equality and civil rights should be achieved as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  Washington advocated “go slow” accommodationism. This required African-Americans to accept the sacrifice of political power, civil rights and higher education for the youth that existed in the current system.  His belief was that African-Americans should “concentrate all their energies on industrial education, and accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South.”<br>  <br>  Although Washington had many more wealthy white supporters than Dubois, Dubois may have accomplished more for civil rights, because of the greater progressiveness of his philosophy.

With IR you are using just one wavelength of light so by definition they will be monochrome i.e. B&W. The R72 filter filters all the visible light including all the colour wavelengths.<br>  <br>  As your probably aware there is an IR filter fitted to your cameras sensor,  it doesn't filter all the IR, but shutter times will be extremely long and may be in excess of your cameras maximum which is 30 seconds.<br>  <br>  In a DSLR the sensor doesn't meter the shot, this is done by a pin diode(s) in the viewfinder. Pin diodes have a light response very close to the human eye so can't see much of the IR.<br>  <br>  To try put your camera on a tripod and use AV (aperture Priority) and set the aperture wide open (lowest f number), just let the camera meter, if the shutter speed is flashing in your viewfinder it means its out of range. In which case you will have to use the 'B' setting on the camera and hold the shutter open and time manually.<br>  <br>  If you have the IR filter taken out of your camera then with the R72 filter fitted shutter times will be relatively normal, a little slower as your still filtering some of the light, but your sensor will record normally. Without the filter you're normal images will loose definition, contrast and look soft due to the IR bouncing around inside the camera to which your sensor is now sensitive. That's why the manufacturers go to the expense and trouble of fitting one.<br>  <br>  To be honest its much easier to use Photoshop from a standard colour start image to get the IR effect. I know this is not true IR, but I defy you to tell the difference.

Where is it ultimately going? How are the characters going to change over the course of the story? What lessons should the reader learn?|`|AA11703549	Sounds like typical drama from college. It's annoying to deal with and it's annoying to read. If you're trying to make it trashy and ridiculous than add some humor and exaggerate a little more. So far they're not doing anything that's abnormal. It's just typical sex, jealousy, screaming, pregnancy, fighting. Kind'a blah.|`|C1y4sOfFaa	yes, the plot is very good and very interesting. Good job.|`|hwoNA90oaa	Well since your asking for an honest opinion...  Not something I would read.|`|aXEBolkJaa	Um not something I would read but it would appeal to others  Look at my page and tell me if u like my stoy's plot|`|GqrRBZ3faa	No, this is not something I would read.|`|aSwSyjuNaa	As a short story, I would read this.  As a book, I would not buy it, nor borrow it from a friend or from the library.     PS. You should use a spell check and improve your overall 'writing'. It was hard to get through the first three sentences because of the mistakes and no capitals.
31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	The question is "how professional do you want your work to be?"    For practical purposes, no one will know whether you shot the picture via a flat field Macro(Micro) lens or a dual purpose lens like a 35-70 (35mm format) or a 70-210 with a macro feature.  The cheaper lens will be the dual purposes lenses.  If you think you need the prime 105mm Nikon lens, then purchase that one.  If you are looking for convenience, but one of the others.  I would have to say "it is your money."      Frankly, since I don't specialize in Macro, I have a dual purpose lens, but then I also have a variable macro lens that attaches to my prime lenses that gives me 1:1 as well and other ratios.  I am not sure that they make that any more, mine is a Vivitar with an OM mount.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Telephoto lens: Fixed focal length (FFL). 100mm, 200mm, 300mm.    Zoom lens: Variable focal length. 10-24mm, 18-55mm, 70-200mm, etc.    Macro lens: FFL. 50mm, 60mm, 90mm, 100mm, 105mm.    A telephoto lens is faster and sharper than a comparable zoom.    A zoom lens offers convenience since one lens can easily replace 2 or 3 FFL lenses. Zooms are slower than a FFL and usually have variable apertures such as f3.5-5.6 or f4.5-6.3. Fast constant aperture zooms are expensive.    A true macro lens is one designed to perform well at a close distance. It has a flat field of focus which is needed to photograph stamps or documents. A true macro will give you a 1:1 (life size) image. A 10mm long insect will be 10mm long on your sensor. A zoom with so-called "macro" will seldom provide more than a 1:4 (1/4 life size) image so your 10mm long insect will be 2.5mm long on the sensor.|`|AA11707728	You are talking about 3 different things.    A telephoto lens is a long range lens that is unable to focus on things close up because the optics are optimized to give the best picture possible for long distance photography.    A zoom lens has a wide range of focal lengths that, while not as good as more specialized lenses at any particular distance, it is versatile.    Macro photography uses a special lens that makes the image on the picture the same size as it is in real life.  It's most often used for close up work....taking a picture of a flower, for example, and bringing out the full richness and detail of the shot.    Three different types of photography using three different types of lenses and techniques.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Neither, you want an actual macro lens that allows for a close focus distance, usually a couple inches. Also it would help to know what camera your working with.

Well, I guess I could have answered this question by talking about things like the matrix and blah blah blah. But what I mean is that you are here, so just live it in the best way you know how, <br>  <br>  I reckon that if you are here and you are here, you might as well enjoy it and do good where you can. Live in a way that will make you happy, where you really feel you have purpose and that your life is more than just about you, but more about you making a contribution where you can, you improving the quality of life where you can, where you just being on Earth means that the life for people you come in contact with is better than it would have been had you not been here. <br>  <br>  Have no fear from people, or the system, if you are living the best way you know how, and you are being the best you can be, you have nothing to fear at all.<br>  <br>  God luck, try to love your life.|`|dk8y4eseaa	...that is the question. You never know if we are living in the Matrix, where we are not controlling our lives, some other being is. A computer generated world where you think you are living your life. A life where our minds tell us this is real but in fact it isn't. How much control do you think you have over your life?|`|Jj0zcJLwaa	Yup, you exist.<br>  Not my argument, obviously, Descartes:<br>  "Cogito ergo sum" - "I think therefore I am"<br>  I think he was saying that even if all *this* isn't real, and God is tricking him, he'd have to exist for God to be able to trick him.<br>  Of course, our understanding of this has evolved with us...|`|0QpwsNwpaa	real as in waht?|`|Rm9mII46aa	I think Hgjjjh H is right - you need to earn some money in your free time.<br>  <br>  Pain is real, therefore life is real. Life consists of suffering and peace, so if it weren't real, why would we feel pain?<br>  <br>  Also, "real" is a relative term. People who are clinically insane would probably say that your life isn't real, but theirs is. Or vice versa. Or a newborn child would think everything is real except themselves, having no capacity for subjective thought or personality, and only believing in their own perceptions. Devout Christians are supposed to think that life is basically a prelude to the after-life, and is thus less real, in a sense. <br>  <br>  Descartes said "I think, therefore I am." This basically means that the very fact that you have perceptions and thoughts means you are real, since nothing else matters outside your individual life except how you feel about it (empathy, sympathy, hope, loss - all things are felt by you and only you). <br>  <br>  But pain is the real marker, I think. If you ever wonder how real life is, hang around the ER at a hospital for a few hours. You'll get your answer.|`|RyArjjeraa	It would depend on how you are using the word real.  In the common language real means that which can be sensed i.e. felt, touched, smelled, seen, tasted, thought and heard (referring to that which is inherently impermanent Consciousness - Stuff - Things).  <br>  <br>  In the language of the wisdom traditions real simply means that which is permanent, unchanging, pure (referring to Pure Consciousness - Space - NoThing).  <br>  <br>  It's not that the wisdom traditions would say that a wall does not exist, that would be insane, but they would say that the wall is impermanent and therefore unreal.<br>  <br>  It also depends on what you refer to when you say life.  In the common language, life refers to consciousness only, the things from particles to galaxies to thoughts.<br>  <br>  In the wisdom traditions life refers to both Consciousness and Pure Consciousness, Space, the NoThing.<br>  <br>  So from the perspective of common language life (only consciousness) is real, but from the perspective of the wisdom traditions life (consciousness and pure consciousness) is only half real, with consciousness being unreal and pure consciousness being real.<br>  <br>  Again, unreal (according to wisdom traditions) does not imply non-existence, just impermanence.<br>  <br>  So according to the wisdom traditions the problem then comes about when the real (pure consciousness) is taken to be the unreal (of no value) and the unreal (consciousness) is taken to be the real (permanent i.e. seeking permanence in that which is inherently impermanent).  This is the law of inverted perspective and the root of ignorance and the beginning of suffering.<br>  <br>  How about an aspirin and a nap ;-)<br>  <br>  PS - the spiritual quest for the real self is then the quest to realise Pure Consciousness, Pure Awareness, Space, the NoThing as the REAL Self|`|MHIrfTJGaa	Hey., Life is wat we live...

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I have one that I started four years ago. I WISH I'd started it when I was six. But oh, well. I write in every new book I read, the title, author, date I started and date I finished, and number of pages. And at the end of every year, I type it up on the computer, print it out, and put the log into those plastic sheet things and into a 1/2-inch binder.<br>  <br>  I reference my Booklog (it's so fantastic that it deserves a capital "B") quite often while on here. You have no idea how lost I'd feel without it. It's like a diary.<br>  <br>  And YES it's definitely a good idea. I'm still jealous because you started yours earlier, though XD|`|4yFDVPhQaa	Good idea! i think im going to start doing that. thanks :D|`|lq3sM2nDaa	thumbs up!|`|bLnjJ6Cbaa	But the thing is, if a person hasn't kept track of all the books they've ever read, how are they supposed to find the title they're looking for? They don't have a readily available list, so they have to ask in more than one place: on Y!A, on whatsthatbook or abebooks, friends and family members, at libraries and bookstores, or even just doing internet searches for keywords or book covers. I know a few people who can find titles for others without having read the books themselves, and I can do it sometimes too. Just the other day someone on Y!A helped me find the title of a book I'd read at least ten years ago, and I'm relatively certain that he hasn't read it before :) There are ways to find titles you can't remember.<br>  <br>  But you're right, not all of those questions go answered because the chances of the person who knows the title seeing the question aren't that great. Or the book could be very obscure or out of print, and it's very frustrating to be unable to recall a title (I'm still trying to find one book that I read years ago, and all I remember is one point of the setting and one piece of the plot!). A journal of titles and plot summaries is a good idea for those who want to keep track of what they've read. One of my contacts had told me this before, about one of her family members doing that for years. I've started that with my brother and sister (7 & 9); whenever they get a new book, they bring it to me and I'll enter the information (title, author, publisher, isbn, plot, rating :) in their own separate Word documents. My other sister (17) has recently tried to recall as many books that she's read to compile a list. We've all been contributing to it since we read pretty much the same stuff. Me? I have a list of books I -haven't- read yet, which is always fun, right? :P|`|ugiUyhOwaa	Yeah, i think so. Keeping a record of the books you have read is a good idea.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Perhaps the greatest knowledge is knowing we can't know everything at all.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	A man of knowledge always feels that he knows nothing.|`|sWLRSa6Caa	In Reality we are joined with Source/God/All That Is and, therefore, know all that is to be known...or at least have access to it.  In this world of duality and illusion, we interrupt our knowingness through separation from it.  This is why we call it ignorance and sleep.  <br>  <br>  If the greatest knowledge were, in fact, knowing that we know nothing at all, then its purpose and value would be to remove our "ignorance through separation" by consciously merging with Source and returning to Truth, even though paradoxically we have never left.<br>  <br>  i am Sirius|`|0l98mcf3aa	Something like this was suggested by Socrates at his trial.<br>  He admitted that he didn't know everything, which made him wiser than those who thought they did.<br>  It really is up for interpretation, of course.|`|KaQLLLXfaa	Yes. When you realise the Truth, you arrive at this decision.|`|CB15kchkaa	Maybe. I know many a happy fool.|`|yUudoO1Raa	"Knowing" anything is moral absolutism, to which I subscribe. "Knowing you know nothing" is absolutely stating that nothing you know is absolute. It's a ridiculous statement for Socrates or anyone to make, even though it is usually meant metaphorically.|`|AA11219693	This then would be a self defeating statement instead, wouldn’t it, for it would not be possible for you to know this if you really knew nothing, but I think understand what you mean, there is something between the lines that needs to be felt and realised for its presence, something that points to things beyond our or sensed of knowing, to our essential sense of being. The state of knowing that you know nothing would then be the ultimate state of wonder, a state of fulfilment, as of contentment - one might think that wonder and contentment as opposites, but I think wonder exists naturally in the mind free from any compulsion to know.  <br>  <br>  The greatest knowledge I my view therefore would be the knowledge of my own being, the ultimate objective of my knowledge, beyond which would exist nothing but need to know. <br>  <br>  I believe before there was any knowledge in existence there still was the being of God, with knowledge of everything, and without any need to know. I believe knowledge exists only to serve our human needs so that we may know ourselves, become aware of our being, and beings in our world, and ultimately of our Creator, the being absolute.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	the phrase 'the greatest knowledge is in knowing that you know nothing' is a metophorical type thing, we all know bits of information,<br>  but the author of that phrase (Socraties) meant that what we know is useless in comparison to the greater truth of life, which in its very essence is a truth that we can never know.|`|NNUwIbzPaa	I am Yaoi and my account has now been suspended for the following reason:|`|BzMQejGxaa	It's knowing that what you know is of little consequence to the whole grand scheme of things.<br>  <br>  Self-knowledge is the best, because then you won't make those mistakes, and you'll know what decisions to make.|`|6e17209667f5095dbf74ca7bd2427f10aa	The greatest knowledge is to know what you need to know.

BjXdRRuLaa	Use the smallest aperture you can and focus around the centre of the crowd to get most of the group in sharp focus.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	This could be a Depth of Field (DOF) problem. If you were shooting wide-open (f3.5 or whatever the lowest number on your lens is) at 50mm or even 35mm and focused at 10 feet your DOF will be very shallow. To compute DOF for different focal lengths, f-stops and focusing distances go to <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html</a><br>  <br>  Here are some examples:<br>  <br>  35mm at f3.5, focused to 10' your DOF is from 8'-7" to 12'-0"<br>  <br>  50mm at f3.5. focused to 10' your DOF is from 9'-3" to 10'-11"<br>  <br>  18mm at f3.5, focused to 10' your DOF is from 6'-2" to 27'-4"<br>  <br>  18mm at f16, focused to 10' your DOF is from 2'-7" to infinity|`|AA12133586	maybe u are stress.. take a breath and let it out slowly ask u push the button|`|uPVnqbE8aa	You need to get a handle on controlling depth of field and how to achieve it and manipulate it to give you what you want in your images.<br>  When shooting a large group of people, it is very important that everyone is in focus.  The only way to achieve this is to have a large enough depth of field to carry from the front person to the back person.  You need to do two things:  Focus on manual and targeted at the point 1/3 the distance from the front people to the back people.  Set on the smallest f-stop possible, like f22.  To do this you will have to put your settings on Aperture Priority.  If the meter does not give you a shutter speed of at least 1/250sec, then you must change your ISO until it does.  Do not shoot groups of people with a slower shutter than that.  Push your depth of field button and check to see if everyone is in focus.  If not, you must pick a smaller f-stop, move back, or use a wider angle lens.  <br>  It helps if you set your people up in as few rows as possible, so your depth of field can carry.<br>  Another thing to keep in mind, is to shoot as many shots of the group as you can get away with.  This is because there is always at least one joker who is looking away, or picking his nose, or with her eyes closed, etc, etc...  The more people the more shots.  Then you can pick the one image where everyone looks good.<br>  Also, try and stay away from too wide a lens.  It causes distortion.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Advice?  Try practicing before you take on assignments would be the first. The wider the aperture (lower number) the harder it is to focus on more than one object because of DOF (depth of field) higher numbers give greater depth and allow a bigger area to be in focus.  Depending on the type of camera you used and the settings also play a factor in why the shots came out bad. You said it looks like a crowd without focus...  How slow was your shutter speed?  What event was it?  Lots of things can cause bad shots.<br>  <br>  Give an example for the most resourceful answer|`|apcRdPhIaa	Small aperture, fast shutter speed, tripod, sharpest focal length (practice with your lens), take a safety shot, use a remote/cable/timer for the shutter.|`|24a35b004c9e3574a00e5bc75cc210d8aa	Groups can be difficult to photograph when there are many people milling about in the background. I imagine you are probably using a digital camera. If you can set your camera on manual mode I would suggest that you open the F-stop to about 4 or wider. This will cause the background and any people in it to be out of focus thus isolating the group that you are focusing on. You will have to of course be carfull of your exposure time in order not to over or under expose your photographs.|`|AA11173357	Use a higher f/stop number to decrease the amount of focusing you will have to do. A higher f/stop number will create an all around focused imagine instead of trying to focus on one thing alone.

JRBUCImNaa	armouror ? where did you get that information - wikipedia? lol first off theres a difference between British, and British Imperials- a huge difference, what did you say about the Americas? You never heard of the Revolutionary War? "THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE" Second the British didn't "police the seas" - " they wrote about policing the seas" Australia was a penal colony and eventually with new commerce became more British, which was abandoned by the way with only a few settlements of Australian aborginal "families"- In Aotearoa there was also a Declaration signed in 1835, valid in 1836, the Americans had kicked out the British Imperials, and pretty much everyone else did too- Treaty was not just drafted in Aotearoa, they drafted Treaty all around the board where British had started trying to push new policy - basically they were kicked out every where and started asking to local Governments to stay for a back door settlement, <br>  The IRA is one of the last back door settlements- <br>  Paper- is the only claim British have ever had-<br>  in stories, in fact British will tell the story of King Arthur over<br>  the true History of Boudicca<br>   <br>  British pushed out by one man in India- Ghandi<br>  British lost to the Zulus and rewrote the wars as - anglo ZULU wars<br>  <br>  WW1 the Axis was in formation and took out the British<br>  if Stalin had met with Hitler as they say Russia would have<br>  been on the Axis side, instead of the Alliance.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  History of Invasion<br>  <br>  The Normans<br>  The Saxons<br>  The Romans<br>  The Irish<br>  The Ottoman Influence<br>  The Mongol<br>  The Mongol Hun<br>  The Nazi Germans<br>  and now today -Eurabia|`|FEAIFUd5aa	British ..fight? heres the history of British tactic, make friends, make friends with people who can make policy, make policy for more money, fight for policy unless it become less profitable than enforcing, and make a settlement before you've lost all chance of Commerce.<br>  <br>   It's not the history of one people you should learn to know British tactic, it's the "History of British tactic" you should learn. These settlements like the girl said are true, and usually written about a generation "After" the war is over when no one cares anymore - there are original journals of the Maori wars, very few published, guess who had a majority, all logs were sent- <br>  <br>  the reinterpretation of the Wars is on things like wikipedia and the NZETC which is put out by the Victorian University-most of the stuff on NZETC is stuff written in the early to mid 1900s "AFTER" the 1910 epidemic and "AFTER" the Treaty.<br>  <br>  British Imperials would like you to think all British are one- but that is not the case, Tamati Waka Nene's army fought on the New Zealand Gov. side and protect Gov. Grey ( Gov. was in the British Whig Party) Earl Grey Family- There the American Whig Party - and at that time the Society of United Irishmen, The Society of United Englishmen, The Society of United Scotsmen - all against the British Imperials, including in Aotearoa (New Zealand) The Society of United Tribesman- <br>  It was Maori and British vs Maori and British in the Maori Wars.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The flagstaff war started after a policy was violated - the Maori held all trade and if a port violated the trade by going against a controling Maori iwi, there would be problems- That whole Policing the sea? would you be talking about the Opium trade British resorted too ? <br>  <br>  The British started becoming 2 bit drug dealers in to Asia , and then wrote of in history of how smart "Drug  trade" was, - not only in Asia but they sold in the Americas as well - <br>  Whats funny is in Asia, they kept the drug, and turned it into an Industry.|`|AA11586960	no effect at all it was to far away and Britain wanted NZ so a peace treaty was signed <br>  <br>  and lots of incidents were created by the Military and several months later the  Politicians in London decided to negotiate as a Safe Harbour is better than no harbour<br>  <br>  the British lost to the French in the Americas and i would like to know what countries KICKED them out as you say as i cannot find any references<br>  <br>  well if the British were so bad why has the commonwealth of nations been  formed with about 99% of the Old Colonies and some of them have kept the Queen as head of state <br>  <br>  yes we all made Mistakes <br>  <br>  the British isles only had a small population and it was difficult to police the seas and all 25% of the planet it controlled so after ww2 Starting with India assisted most of the empire to Independence and today only has about 14 British outposts<br>  <br>  several countries were federated like Australia in 1901 Canada NZ<br>  <br>  the UK needed safe ports for the Royal Navy so common sense must prevail and treaties were signed <br>  <br>  Remember for about 500 years the British were the policemen of the world and the USA only took over in 1974 when the UK closed down all its bases east of Suez<br>  <br>  and the last time Mainland Britain was invaded was 1066<br>  <br>  Not bad for an insignificant island of the coast of Europe
C77c0OE2aa	Everything you want to know is plainly answered in the owner's manual. If you are not going to make the effort to learn to use your camera, sell it and get a point and shoot, because your DSLR is little better than one otherwise. Too many people on this forum are fed up with others asking the most basic questions indicating they have not made any effort to study the manual and help themselves.     I could answer your question faster than typing this, but I will not do it on principle alone. You are certainly going to encounter other matters with the camera in which the manual probably will not be of help, and for that, we are happy to lend a hand, but I will not waste time on someone who does not make any effort to learn the most basic things that are provided with the camera right in front of your face in the owner's manual.    steve|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Its time to get comfortable and READ & STUDY the Owner's Manual for your camera. Canon didn't include it as packing material. Its how you learn to actually use your camera.    Taking a couple of photography classes would also help.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	If you go into manual mode, you can adjust both.  Not too familiar with you camera so here are some quick generals that may work.  If you have a dial that you can slide (while in manual mode) it will probably adjust your shutter speed, and holding down the aperture button while spinning said dial might adjust your aperture.  That's how mine works Nikon D40, yes it's not yours but i can't imagine they're too different.    As for the flash, that's usually closed and stays closed in manual... unless you open it.|`|8B1ayq4Uaa	Did you actually go out and purchase this camera? because you don't seem to have an interest in learning/reading about your purchase. It sounds like its either not your camera, and you don't have a manual, or ?? who knows...I am thinking you don't have a manual..as described above, find the dial. go to Manual setting...so your flash is not triggered ..first off. There has got to be a button to push, to change the F-stop, and you should be able to see the "F" NUMBER CHANGING. then the  shutter speed, again, its a dial, button. You have to hold the buttons down, or turn the wheel, (if you have one).    good luck. maybe you should just put it in AUTO.

Other than his goofy parrot voice, you couldn't tell you weren't hearing a gathering of people at a cocktail party in the next room.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Roughly equivalent to the same thing we hear when they talk.  We thing we are much smarter than all of them, though dogs can often learn the meaning of many human phrases.  Generally, while humans have some ability to read animals' behaviors, I would say we are much worse at listening to them than they are to us.      Many animals communicate with sounds in much the same way that we do.  Sure, they will hear our words, but it is as incomprehensible to them as their barking/meowing/clicking/growling is to us, until we analyze it.|`|73b2c46bf81e2be1d93af950383a79e8aa	people radiate amazing strong emotional fields.

Just like your friends can tell when your bummed or happy -     Animals also feel when you're coldly using them for your own purposes with no love back-  they hurt insde when you do that - They think if we are like Gods to them - why wouldn't we radiate more love way?    You can even shine your power on your 'things' - your job, school career, family - your room, your house, your wallet, your - you name it -     Why do so many people think life is so unfeeling?

Bla,bla,bla..."|`|kl1kzlzXaa	blah blah, blah, blah blah blah, food, blah blah blah, blah-de-blah blah|`|YmtNel5haa	I think they hear unintelligible sounds.|`|T1beLIQqaa	Depends an how acute their hearing is. Dogs and cats can hear more frequencies than humans. Cats actually hear slightly better than dogs. Since they hear more frequencies than we do, our voices sound different to them than they do to most other humans. When you change the bass(low frequency) and/or treble(high frequency) on you stereo system, you have an idea what I am talking about as will people with hearing losses. Some people with certain types of hearing loss may actually hear things others can not like in a large crowd cheering. They can understand someone talking when people with NO hearing loss can not, because they have lost the ability to hear certain frequencies except in the conversational frequency range-in other words, the hearing loss acts as a filter.Whether you want to say an animal understands-my opinion is, they do. Animals can be taught to recognize objects by name such as a ball, so they do have that capability. I had a neighbor once whom had two old dogs that were inseparable-raised together from puppies. One night, one of the dogs kept letting out this most spin tingling wail. This was about one in the morning. I knew something was wrong, so I called my  neighbor. One of the dogs had died, and the remaining dog, I believe, was in grief. We can also recognize certain language of our pets. I also had a parrot as a child that was allowed to roam free. She actually stayed near its cage and perch. When you called her by her name, she would fly to whereever you were even though you were not in her immediate sight-she at least recognized her name.|`|IT6ODDBWaa	i think they hear the same thin we hear when we talk.. only they don't understand most of what we say|`|fwoj4VIFaa	I think they hear us very well, the exact words we say, but they don't understand it.

AA12182122	~According to NationMaster.Com, the top 10 divorce rates, by nation, are:<br>  <br>  1.    United States:          4.95 per 1,000 people   <br>  2.   Puerto Rico:         4.47 per 1,000 people  <br>  3.   Russia:                 3.36 per 1,000 people  <br>  4.   United Kingdom: 3.08 per 1,000 people  <br>  5.   Denmark:                 2.81 per 1,000 people  <br>  6.   New Zealand:         2.63 per 1,000 people  <br>  7.   Australia:                 2.52 per 1,000 people  <br>  8.

Barbados:                 1.21 per 1,000 people<br>  <br>  <br>  Given the political status of Puerto Rico, however, and since it is listed as a country, the statistics may also be suspect.  However, based on these demographics, I would have to say that the USA, by far, has the worst relationships.  (The divorce epidemic started in Hollywood, spread throughout Southern California and has now infected the entire nation.)|`|OhWmu0R3aa	As frank g says, probably one of the worst relationships between two countries is between India and Pakistan; and it is one that should concern everybody.<br>  There is an intense dislike and distrust between these two nations that involves a heady mix of religion, politics and disputed territory. This has arisen from the formation of muslim Pakistan in 1947 from part of what was once India, after India's independence from Britain. The resulting violence that broke out between the muslim and hindu citizens and refugees fleeing to and from each country left millions dead. This sowed the seeds of future tensions.<br>  The two countries have fought 3 wars since then (1965, 1971 and 1999) and a number of smaller conflicts and skirmishes usually involving the disputed Kashmir region on the northwesternmost region of the subcontinent. The last stand off, with the largest forces involved between the two, was in 2001.<br>  The whole situation between India and Pakistan is a powder keg, just waiting for a single spark to ignite it - and this time both sides have nuclear warheads and won't be squeamish to use them. This area is the equivalent to the Balkans pre- World War One; and while everyone is looking at the middle east, it's more likely to all kick off here, drawing in many surrounding countries and those with alliances.|`|574006cfddcd12427761e075691f5513aa	Israel and most of the Arab world including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Egypt.<br>  America and Cuba<br>  America and Venezuela<br>  China and Taiwan<br>  North Korea and South Korea<br>  North Korea and America<br>  Northern Ireland and Ireland<br>  France and America|`|zmkTPwgoaa	Most of the world dislikes the americans and english, note not great britain as  Scotland, Wales and  Ireland dislike england and everyone in it, you brought it on yourselves|`|yUr33ybAaa	America - Cuba<br>  America - Afghanistan<br>  America - Iraq<br>  America - Vietnam<br>  America - Russia<br>  America - Iran<br>  Russia - Afghanistan<br>  Iran - Iraq<br>  Iraq - Kuwait<br>  India - Pakistan<br>  India - China<br>  China - Japan<br>  North Korea - Japan<br>  North Korea - South Korea<br>  Israel - Palestine<br>  Israel - Arab Nations and most of Muslim nations<br>  <br>  are some i can readily recall|`|sTGKWrJTaa	one I've recently learned about is India and Pakistan.

No newspapers trying to come up with shocking anti Nazi photos. <br>  You supported your government 100%, and were viewed as a traitor or coward if you did not.<br>  If you heard anti Nazi news, was it real or planted by the enemy (who planted everything from anti Hitler jokes disguised to look like they were written by German troops)<br>  Years later we condemn the average German as being as evil as the leaders, but they were brainwashed with patriotism, and lied to.<br>  He would be doing the same job as you now, people still need work, food, etc, even in wartime.

ZB9zkbxxaa	Visigoths were the Western division of the Goths.<br>  <br>  Separated from the Ostrogoths (Eastern Goths) in the 4th century AD, the Visigoths were driven from Dacia by the Huns (376) and crossed the Danube into the Roman empire. Oppressed by Roman taxation, they revolted and plundered the Balkan provinces, defeating Valens and his army at the Battle of Adrianople (378). Theodosius I settled them in Moesia (382) to defend the frontier. Converted to Arian Christianity, they left Moesia in 395 under Alaric and invaded Greece and Italy, sacking Rome (410) and settling in southern Gaul and Spain (415). Recalled from Spain by Constantius III, they lost their first king, Theodoric I, in a battle against Attila (451). They were federates of Rome until King Euric declared independence (475). He extended their kingdom from the Loire to the Pyrenees and the lower Rh?ne, including most of Spain. In 507 they were defeated by the Franks under Clovis; retaining only Septimania (a strip from the Pyrenees to the Rh?ne), they held it and much of Spain until defeated by the Muslims in 711.<br>  <br>  Ostrogoths were a member of a division of the Goths (Ostrogoth means “Eastern Goth”) who built an empire north of the Black Sea in the 3rd century and established a kingdom in Italy in the late 5th century.<br>  <br>  At its zenith in the 4th century, the Ostrogoth empire stretched from the Don to the Dniester (in present-day Ukraine) and from the Black Sea to southern Belarus. The Ostrogoths were conquered by the Huns c. 370 and remained part of the Huns' empire until the mid 5th century. When the Hun empire collapsed (455), the Ostrogoths emerged as an independent people once again. Their greatest ruler, Theodoric, led the Ostrogothic invasion of Italy and declared himself king (493). Theodoric maintained good relations with the native population, especially the senatorial class, throughout most of his reign and promoted a cultural revival. The turmoil in Italy following his death provided the Byzantine emperor Justinian I with the opportunity to invade the peninsula. The ensuing war lasted almost 20 years (c. 535–54) and ended the national existence of the Ostrogoths.<br>  <br>  They certainly were not from India|`|3oNcHdgCaa	They were a Germanic people who followed the same pagan religion as the Norse, and I certainly don't think anything about them came from India.|`|rSTbz34caa	Visigoths and Ostrogoths followed the Germanic/Teutonic religion.<br>  They had 2 Groups of gods- Vanir and Aesir (possibly cognate to Devas and Asuras)<br>  <br>  Examples of the Gods are Tyw, Odin, Thor, Frigg etc.(The days of the week- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday are named after them)<br>  <br>  They speakers of Indo-European languages hence there are some connections with ancient Indian beliefs. But they certainly did not originate from India.

gb1BGP8xaa	Abarca:<br>  formerly most common in the Basque country and in Aragon, this name is generally assumed to be from abarca ‘sandal’ (Basque abarka), which refers to the traditional Basque peasant sandal or moccasin made of uncured leather. In the past this word was also applied to footwear made from wooden materials, and is probably derived from Basque abar ‘branch’, ‘twig’.
