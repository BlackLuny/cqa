JTsYDJPYaa	nah...idts...ur nose it too thick...maybe a ring on the bottom left side of your mouth.(if you really want one)|`|92VH41EZaa	I think you have a very distinguishing nose so maybe a lip piercing to draw some attention there because you have a nice mouth so a piercing there would emphasize that, i perfer lip piercings on anyone nose studs look... common idk sorry to anyone that has one its just my opinion but they do look good on certain people... <br>  <br>  i'd think you'd look better with the lip ring. but i know a few people that have had a job keeping up the hygiene of facial piercings because they can get easily infected and require daily cleaning which is more hassle than it sounds so be prepared for that, and make sure you go to a place that has a good and clean reputation because if it goes wrong, it leaves scars... my friend got  a bridge and now she has a scar each side of her nose at the top... so think carefully.<br>  <br>  but i'd say go for it wherever you feel comfortable it's your face your decision, dont worry about what other people think, its you expressing yourself and no-one can judge that.<br>  <br>  good luck!! and dont worry you'll look great whatever you choose x|`|aRYYOjmmaa	listen..you are BEAUTIFUL..you have a great skin and a pretty little nose..you do not need a lip ring or a stud..trust me they can totally destroy your skin and also cause pimples around the area. but if you really really need it..lip ring would go better bcoz you have nice shapely lips whch would carry the ring perfectly..<br>  p.s. i am a girl and i am straight ;)|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	I think a round ring either on your lip or nose would look better than a stud.

Pp7ThhNmaa	make sure you take both of the photos with you, and I love the styles they're supper hot! Explain what you want done, if you are wanting to keep length or if you want it just like the pic. The stylist should explain how it would look on you, and also ask if it will go good with your face shape. Don't go somewhere cheap to get your hair done, because they usually are the ones that just got out of beauty school and haven't tried most hairstyles on a person. Look in to salons first in the phone book and online, when you find some that you think you like call and ask how much it would coast to do a cut (with layers, color, or whatever) so you know the range and even if they just give you a guess of how much it will be that's a really good thing because then you know that they really have to get a feel for your hair first. If they just give you a coast of like $10.00 DON'T GO THERE! because you want someone that has been doing hair for a while. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|BtK9nSalaa	yeah it'll look good. just bring the pic to her/him.<br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmAWaaKOiBH44edaHPTf7LMgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=200902181754">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|rulABcARaa	yeah it would look ok, loads of people have/ had it and so its a bit uncoventional and boring.<br>  never TELL a hairdresser what you want, bring a picture, and also make sure they cut it into the hair well, so that it looks more natural x|`|3kCmqrnzaa	Well it would actually<br>  Just print out the 2nd photo & give it to the hairdresser & say can I have that fringe please..don't be shy either..& tell them you do not want the haircut only the fringe|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Yeah it's really nice fringe take it to your local hair dressers and ask them.

K4Pwd3kfaa	I know that everyone's saying that you should go with silver, but it's just going to be a little too matchy-matchy....which tends to be a little tacky. Try a satin pump in a crimson red. I'll still go with the dresses texture, but it still stands out. You might also want to try some chunky crimson red jewelry, and an oversized, red clutch. :)<br>  Or you could replace red with gold! Gold always goes with cool colours. It adds some richness to an already bright colour. I know you might think that I'm crazy, but try it out on Polyvore. Trust me! :)|`|iLQ87NSUaa	strappy and silver or something like these<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodyc.com/BodyCentral/womens.fashion/itemdetl.html?lvl1=Shoes&lvl2=SShoes&item=3356" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyc.com/BodyCentral/womens....</a>|`|5G1pED6yaa	Silver..<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking<br>  KittyKatty|`|cEIpOQAKaa	wouldnt matter! its gorgeous :D|`|YQxxVdLNaa	I think that the black heels would look the best.

I think the dress would look better with gold accessories.|`|RvEnbEJcaa	Silver. Black will so not match. you need something shiny like the dress.|`|ZIOLl00xaa	i think with a dress like this you could be bold and do a yellow or hot pink pump and wear accessories to match. Silver and black are the usual colors to wear with this but really a big yawn. Believe me celebrities never do the whole matchy matchy things and it looks great. Just try some different colors with it. CUTE DRESS TOO!|`|W0kEGRhraa	i really like this dress! so cuteee. nice find (: <br>  i would say silveer would look the best. because since the dress is shiny and bright, silver heels will just make your whole look polished and shiny.<br>  you are going to look great! get some silver jewelery to go along with it!|`|nALZjZZgaa	i think silver deffo.<br>  it would make the dress seem lighter and probably make your legs look longer as black is a very solid colour and gold would look a bit iffy.|`|YqeTqnUYaa	I would def wear gold with all gold accessories...That's if you don't mind standing out...If you rather not then just go with something silver and strappy with minimal jewelry...|`|USxxSS7qaa	Silver would give it a funkier look. It's a fashion rule not to wear black and blue together, people don't usually follow it though..|`|KmBBGUa6aa	wow this is really tough. but silver definitely. it matches the shiny-ness.|`|KDXisAOlaa	silver would complement it wayy better than black.|`|5vFGO57Kaa	I'd say silver, but gold might be nice if they're not to gaudy.

c9pcGciqaa	my new thing is a side pony tail . it's really cute if you put a little bit of curl into it too , and leave just a tiny strand on the opposite side and curl it lightly . or you could do a half up half down style , but instead of just pulling your hair back and clipping it or whatever you decide to do , i like to use bobby pins to do it , but like i was saying is to push up the back of the part that is up , so there is a little hump . it looks really good like that . use a little hair spray too . also , take a shower at night , get someone to do two french braids and sleep in them , not too tight sort of loose , and when you wake up your hair will be really pretty with tons of curls ! write me back if you need anymore !|`|zvaIyudcaa	<a href="http://www.coolbuddy.com/wallpapers/INDCELEB/indceleb_home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolbuddy.com/wallpapers/INDC...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Visit here there are many indian actresses here<br>  try some eastern style|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Chop it all off.<br>  That's what I just did, and I feel like a whole new person.<br>  Now it just barely brushes my shoulders.|`|i01egybJaa	You could try curling and straightening your hair.<br>  <br>  Like, use a scrunching gel for curling, and a hair straightener or blow dryer for straightening.<br>  <br>  Also, experiment with different accessories. Like, sweep your hair up into a ponytail. Using a claw clip, clip up the ponytail so your hair falls over it. It looks like a very cool messy bun.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)

m8nCrzuVaa	You'll be fine. I started at a 14g, and skipped to a 10g, then to an 8 and so on, now I'm at a 2g. For now, you can get away with going to a 12g from a regular piercing. Just remember once you get up into bigger sizes (for me it was like 6g, and 4g to 2g) it'll start hurting more because your ears have to adjust to the change. It'll be important to wait once you get up there if you plan on it.<br>  Don't worry, it'll be fine. Just use some kind of antibiotics ointment when you but them through to keep them clean, and make them go in easier.<br>  Good luck. :]|`|flv6d9H1aa	Yeah, I started with 12's it didn't hurt at all, then I went straight to 8's that hurt a little bit but now I'm at 3/4 it's all goood.|`|gXBPLitzaa	You should probelly just wait to be on the safe side. :)

Even if you dressed classy, spoke elegantly, and walked with confidence; it looks tacky and "slutty". I hate that word, but think about it. A tongue piercing isn't for aesthetics; nobody really sees it. It's mainly for oral sex. Not saying EVERYONE who gets one gets it for that, but it's the first think most people think when they see one.<br>  <br>  Maybe get new holes on your ears? It's not trashy, and earrings are awesomely cool! <br>  <br>  Even a belly button piercing would be better. <br>  <br>  Good luck :]

It did loosen up my tighter curls, but made other pieces really straight, so I ended up having a weird hair texture. It also made my hair really brittle and dry. So I basically had to cut off all my hair and start all over natural. <br>  <br>  Here is a factual websites about ingredients. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://cosmeticdatabase.com/product.php?prod_id=71726&refurl=%2Fbrowse.php%3Fbrand_id%3D26%26" rel="nofollow">http://cosmeticdatabase.com/product.php?...</a><br>  <br>  Just For Me products apparently have a very high hazard level (this is a factual unbiased website btw). Bare Mineral Indulgence has a natural curl "relaxer" that is made just for biracial and black kids. It accentuates the curls, cuts down on frizziness, amkes the hair VERY soft and manageable and loosens up the curl pattern some. You get two Herbalaxer packets (they are about 8 oz in size) on their site. All their products are all natural and worked really well for me (I use the adult line though). So yeah..... hope that helps :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://baremineralindulgence.com/Girls_Natural_Hair.html" rel="nofollow">http://baremineralindulgence.com/Girls_N...</a>

IIztioS3aa	i had one for a little while. the hair in front of my ears was no longer than chin length. and i had sweeping bangs across my forehead. the back was really short. like an inch and a half and i would straighten it so that it swooped up and out.<br>  <br>  the front looked kinda like this but the bangs would side sweep across my forehead... <a href="http://saylula.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/rihanna-pixie-cut.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://saylula.files.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  but the back was a little longer and didn't look so much like a boys cut cuz it would spike out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gallery.becomegorgeous.com/short_hairstyles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gallery.becomegorgeous.com/sh...</a> the 2nd one is close to what i had, i'm a little surprised that i didn't have any pictures of my own cut.|`|Gh2jzOHYaa	any of these would be cute<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?p=pixie+haircut&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <br>  i like the first the best

xsBYB42eaa	IDK|`|37E2yPGjaa	If You Want More Curves: Look a bit more voluptuous in a dress that's either a fitted sheath style, or an A-line that gives the appearance of curves, but also help to accentuate your slender figure. Skip dresses that are strapless which tends to make the shoulder and neck areas appear even thinner. <br>  <br>  If You Want to Downplay Your Hips: Choose ball gowns or full-skirted dresses that make the waist appear thinner and also hide larger hips. Avoid any style that's form-fitting or that features a V-neckline, which causes the eyes to look downward making the hip area appear wider. <br>  <br>  If You Want to Hide a Large Backside: Avoid anything in clingy material or dresses in the sheath style, and choose from full-skirted gowns and dresses that will help to hide both your bottom and hips, if needed. Dresses with form-fitting bodices are also perfect for creating that enviable hourglass figure.|`|B3aiSAKMaa	You should probably not post pictures of yourself on an unsafe internet source..<br>  But nonetheless, i think a long, strapless dress would be cute for your sister in navy would be cute (since pale skin looks great with dark blue). Try Macy's or Bloomingdales for some.<br>  For you, I think a short dress would be better (to show off your legs) in a dark color as well.

You will have to shave almost everyday to stop the hair growing back and that can cause a lot of irritation over time which would require a lot of moisturising.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Well if you like the shaved appearance then keep shaving it, eventually your skin will get use to be shaven and you won't get the red bumps.|`|7oDK0w7qaa	Sounds like ingrown hairs.<br>  You should just leave it to grow out unless you want to put up with constant itchiness.|`|MRhpYS77aa	either let it grow and keep it trimmed or go for weekly waxing (men's is called back, crack and sack wax lol).|`|aMN86HoYaa	well i would suggest letting it grow out you would have to shave it frequently to prevent the irritation you are dealing with now. It may be ingrown hairs, or just the fabric of your undies rubbing against the small hairs that can make you itch, or maybe if u used a hair removal cream or shave gel that is irritating the the SPECIFIC region of your body. But like i said let if grow out and just keep it trimmed. This takes less time to keep up- maybe trim it once a week or whenever you notice that is unusually bushy.|`|zTuCpdfyaa	You have razor burn, you are most likely going to keep getting those bumps every time you shave for a good while. <br>  <br>  I have been shaving for almost 4 years now and I am glad I did, keep shaving.<br>  <br>  It will be a nuisance at first cause of the appearance and itching but it will all come together further down the road.|`|IIztioS3aa	your bound to get itchy as it grows back. the red marks are probably just irritation. if you let it sit a few days it should get past the itchy stage if you didn't like it shaved. if you liked it, then just keep it up.|`|3bysSXBZaa	Use Sudacrem the now and the itching and the redness will go down.

2qb5pSjFaa	what you said sounds good. :O|`|KIzrFkYAaa	What you suggested sounds fine! But I do suggest to make sure the party dress isn't too... "festive" or to fancy- because a funeral is not the place to make a fashion statement, or even to feel "cute". I know that Children's Place Store has high quality clothing, and its very fashionable, for a very reasonable price. They carry little girl dresses too.. you should  be able to find something that would work there.|`|asGVrqhEaa	I like what you said but, your taking them to a funeral so little, is the person that passed very close to you?

5fZsA7sUaa	After your baby is born your breasts will grow after having milk in them. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't get implants. Firstly, you're supposed to replace your implants every 10 years, which means you'll have to always have money to do the procedure over and over (which will also damage the skin every time you do it... that's why you see many celebs with weird breasts after a while). Secondly, implants, especially when you're very skinny, will look very fake and hard. So it really comes down to the question of which is more important to you: quantity or quality? <br>  <br>  If you're completely flat you could just do exercises that build up your breast muscles. For most women doing these exercises only reshape the breast and make it lifted, but since you say you're completely flat it will actually make you have larger breasts.<br>  <br>  It would also take away the ability to have stimulation in your breasts and nipples. Think about it though, would men go through a cosmetic procedure that would decrease their ability to have sexual stimulation in a certain area of their body?|`|g2yUDLygaa	The biggest con to breast implants is you make yourself eye-candy for all the guys -- including the lecherous ones.  I can understand why you would want to get implants if you are, as you say, "flat as a plank," but do you really want the males cozying up to you because they like your rack, as opposed to liking you for the person that you are?  Even if you're married, I'm willing to bet serious money that your hubby would say he likes you just fine the way you are.  Why spend that kind of money and endure the knife (and all the potential risks involved) for a bigger chest that'll probably be more trouble than it's worth?|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	Pros- you would have the boob size you are so desperate for and probably the attention too.<br>  <br>  Cons- you would have disgusting fake sacks of s*** inside your body, that would look and feel nasty. People would think you were a cheap ****. Men prefer real breasts and I bet you would look better with small natural ones than fake aoobs of alien boobs of any size.|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	If you are uncomfortable with your body, you should do it. No personal experience...but I am too big-boobed and wish I had money to get a reduction. I think one con is they look so fake. I was looking at a before and after picture gallery when I was daydreaming about getting a reduction...none of the fake boobs looked natural. They were perky in a gravity-defying way and looked like plastic balls with skin stretched over them. Another con is I hear you lose skin sensitivity and aren't able to breast feed afterwards.|`|ZIOLl00xaa	hey, im 18 and i hit puberty a long time ago and still have very very small boobs, i only wear bras because im to embarrassed not to. Im like a 32 A of sometimes 34. Im skinny too 5'9 and weigh 125. My mom just got breast implants. She got saline which is basically salt water in a bag which are way safer then Silicone. You would have to get saline also because this is your first breast implant. cons of that is they don feel or look as real as silicone but they arent all that bad. And you might want to wait because ur breast are gonna be producing milk for a while and it will be better to wait!|`|dWmT9pBhaa	How old are you? How much do you weigh? Maybe you could try gaining some weight if you are a bit skinny. I am never a supporter of implants though, but if your breasts look like the kind a guy might have then I guess you might want to consider it.|`|oaoylqkyaa	About Breast implants can be read in <a href="http://good-blog-people.blogspot.com/?q=Breast%20implants" rel="nofollow">http://good-blog-people.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>
D76p9cxsaa	Nice hair :)<br>  Try not to move the straighteners slowly, straighten quickly in small sections, it'll make it look more texturised.<br>  Also, if your fringe is sticking out, when you straighten it, curl it under, not too much or it'll look silly, but just enough for it not to stick out. <br>  Just experiment, you'll soon find a way of getting it to look its best :)|`|7YVon6dsaa	Go back to the hairdresser and see if the same person will style your hair again for you. Then just pay close attention to what he or she does. You could also just tell your hairdresser that you are trying to get your hair to look like it did, and show them the picture. Ask them what products and techniques they used. That is the sure fire way of figuring it out.

Y2If4RcAaa	Ringlets always make you look like a poodle. Big, sexy, beachy waves/curls are hot now. Use a larger barreled curling iron and wrap it around so that it kinda cascades. Idk how to explain it just dont wrap your hair over itself. Then when it is still warm run your fingers through it once. Then spray your hair with texturizing spray. Finish by spraying your whole head with a little hair spray.<br>  <br>  Dont forget heat protection before you curl your hair, you dont want fried hair :]
yyFgUv8Jaa	It's advised not to wash your hair everyday as this strips the hair of its natural oils that keep it looking healthy. I recommend dry shampoo basically it comes in an aerosol can, once sprayed onto the hair it turns into powder soaking up the surrounding sebum. It works wonders! A cheaper alternative to this is baby powder just put some on the roots where the grease is and it will soak it up leaving you with pretty hair.<br>  Plus make sure your washing out shampoo/conditioner correctly(unless its a leave in conditioner) as this can leave excess product on your hair.<br>  Hope I helped x|`|4NXi5Tmoaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  You might just be one of those unlucky ones who suffers from greasy hair but it could just be down to you touching it a lot or washing it too much. You shouldn't really touch your hair a lot as your fingers have oil on them. Also, putting it back a lot makes it greasy too. Its best not to wash your hair everyday as you end up washing vital minerals out which make it produce more minerals which make it look greasy. Try washing it every other day or go to you GP and ask him to prescribe you a shampoo which prevents it or something.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|iJAa5rDyaa	Do you wash it daily? <br>  <br>  If you dont have the time [like me] I use a great product, its a spray in shampoo to use to dry hair..  it does work with my hair and it feels fresher and seems to cut through what grease i get- i tend to have dry damaged hair but it does get greasy.. <br>  <br>  There are loads of products avaliable try googling Spray on shampoo - or go to your local chemist , thats where i got mine C:|`|mDkrW9Odaa	Get good shampoo and conditioner ...and don't use too much because that makes ur hair greasy. <br>  And if you use other products on it try less coz they might also make ur hair like that ...and if that doesn't work you can try this hair treatment .<br>  <a href="http://tgel.com/uk/?gclid=CNuqkLPJ6ZgCFUaK3godSmba0g" rel="nofollow">http://tgel.com/uk/?gclid=CNuqkLPJ6ZgCFU...</a>|`|FkQXcZW9aa	Buying better quality shampoo - ie the type your hairdresser sells not supermarket stuff might help.<br>  <br>  Basically you want shampoo that doesn't strip your hair of all its natural protection.  I would ask your hairdresser to advise you.<br>  <br>  andrew|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	A beauty tip I heard was to put baby powder in your hair when it's greasy. I do it all the time. When I straighten my hair it seems to get greasy faster so it's not like I don't wash my hair enough. It'll be greasy right after I wash it! Baby Powder!<br>  Hope this helps you!|`|ef5e7522911c0c07508f67134050536daa	Final rinse either w/vinegar if your hair is dark, lemon juice if hair is light. Use one tablespoon in a cup of warm water & pour over hair. Close your eyes while doing this. Don't rinse out. Apply witch hazel to your scalp once or twice a week. Saturate a pad part your hair and wipe it on. Or you can try sprinkling corn starch in your dry hair and then brush it out. All these measures help, some better than others depending on your hair type and texture. Keep your brush & comb clean. Good luck.|`|MmR9LeLhaa	wash it :P<br>  x<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219135019AAw8nF9">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|7ddRIZxIaa	i started getting this when i was about 12<br>  realised the only way to get rid of greasy hair is to wash it!<br>  i haven't tried dry shampoo so i can't really say anything on that though <br>  good luck ;) x|`|I5PdelDoaa	dry shampoo!!!! i cant live without it. it really refreshes ur hair and soaks up the grease also very little or no conditioner!!!|`|JFhXJM6haa	baby powder!
bogfZ6Xsaa	That is sooooooooo funny, because as an almost giant I hit about 5' 11 1/2" and I HATE it! I've ALWAYS wanted to be petite and cute, but I feel like a man woman....not to dig on myself, because people tell me I should be a model, but they don't understand how sucky it is always looking down on people. I can't shop at the normal stores like RAVE or even Victoria's Secret for that matter. It's almost like a Lane Bryant for skinny people! Even if a guy wanted a tall girl....the girl (like me) may not want a short guy. I want someone WAY taller than me! So be thankful you can walk into a store and grab random Ex. Small clothes and fit into them. So when you're standing in a club looking up at a girl losing your self confidence...you never know....consider that it might be me looking down at you losing mine. Short or tall...God loves us no matter what. Don't be self conscious...I'd trade you any day!<br>  Hope this helped!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	they wouldnt have  identical body shapes if one is taller and one is shorter. men don't girls because of their size. its the way people carry themselves.

mb8PO88iaa	I wish people would be more specific on what their ideal hairstyle would be...like will you have an hour of time to style it in the morning before going off to work or school...or will it be a wash and go almost low-maintenance kind of hairstyle? But nevertheless here's my preference...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cfs9.blog.daum.net/image/9/blog/2007/12/02/00/22/47517c252ee57&filename=????4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cfs9.blog.daum.net/image/9/blog/2...</a><br>  <br>  I think what best suits you currently is to have a side swept fringe so that your face doesn't look too round or square...TRUST ME I'M ASIAN!!!! So probably the girl in the orange box at the bottom in the last row. Her hair is slightly layered but not to the point that her hair is super thin which I think YOU should follow...a hair that is layered but not EXTREMELY layered. <br>  <br>  Also about your bangs...you can easily cut them yourself saving you a trip to the salon! Just get a pair of hair cutting scissors that you can buy at a drugstore and then to get bangs kind of like that demi lovato (is that how you spell it?) picture just gather bangs to the center of your forehead, holding them between your second and third finger and then snip slowly and steadily. But what I do is that I make one side shorter than the other and as you go steadily to the other side of my bangs, my bangs are progressively getting longer as well to create a fringe and depending how steep the "slope" your bangs creates you can have bangs llike that girl I told you about or like the guy on the bottom row on the far left<br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2585843745_3e19bed016_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2585...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|heCuvfPSaa	Any one you pick|`|19pBM4GSaa	hi again sweetie, you have posted this question twice oops, but il answer on this one aswell, the look you want to go for on the second pic is beautiful, will look really nice, and ignore what that horrible person said before, thats just plain mena, i reported her so just ignore her chic xxxx|`|paLHVowyaa	i think side swept bangs would suit you, just go on to google  images and type in side bangs and then take your pick :)

pqlhPnexaa	First of all, you hair needs to be cut similarly to hers: long at the back, with lots of layers and sort of tapering near the front.<br>  <br>  Then what I'd do would be to take a comb and separate your hair into two sections, running from about an inch in front of you ear to your other ear. Using either a coarse comb or a brush (with wire teeth), tease the hair behind the part down, then pull it back into a messy bun. Spray this with hair spray.<br>  <br>  Next, take the hair at the front, pull it straight up, and tease one side of it until you have a lot of volume near the roots. Then, using gel, tame it so it lies the way you want. If you look in the picture, most of it is teased except about an inch of hair on the left- you should probably do this too.<br>  <br>  Then spray your whole head with hairspray again, and you're good to go. Good luck!!!|`|KvMxF5Tyaa	take the pic to a salon. thats wat i did and it looked totally the same. gl. but i think if ur a girl u shud go 4 longer hair cuz thats kinda boyish...no offence. good luk|`|nW24A807aa	go to bed.<br>  wake up.<br>  <br>  and ur hair will look just like hers.
cxOTJKUuaa	Really, all you have to do is go to a decent hair salon you know of, and give them a picture of the hairstyle you want( such as <a href="http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u248/whitpay/Scene%20Hair/1469668813_l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u248/...</a> or <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SJv5MkfWRyI/AAAAAAAAAsk/3yUSiOSoi5M/s400/Mullet+Mad+Rad+Emo+Hair.jpg)." rel="nofollow">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SJ...</a> Make sure you let them know to focus on the choppy, layered look of the hairstyle.|`|QVZDhgAqaa	you mean basketball?

F57mAkXZaa	i have human hair dread extensions....they are a lot more work than synthetic...as much work as real dreadlocks but they look great and much more real than synthetic.  i originally went for human hair as i was having trouble matching my  haircolor which is special effects atomic pink.  i started with weft hair and dyed it to match.  then when dry i cut about an inch from the weft (you can use loose hair too but it is harder to find)  then while holding one end tight i backcombed the other end as much as i could.  then i switched and backcombed the loose end.  you might have to do this a few times to get it tight enough.  cutting the hair from the weft allows you to have double ended dreads which are easier to braid in i think, but you can leave the hair attached and then attach the weft to your head.  <br>  <br>  after backcombing i then used knotty boy dreadwax (knottyboy.com)  and twisted and used a flatiron to melt the wax and form the dread.  <br>  <br>  i braided them in using a double ended dread technique.  i wash them once a week with dr. bronners soap.  you MUST use a soap that leaves no residue.  then when they are fully dry i reroll them with dreadwax.  <br>  <br>  you can find tutorials on attaching dreads at doctoredlocks.com<br>  <br>  and you can find instructions on how to care for human dreads at knottyboy.com or any other of the many sites people have put up about caring for dreads.  <br>  <br>  i think about every month and a half or so i have to redo the braids....but it cuts back on the frequency i have to dye my roots!!<br>  <br>  good luck!  human hair is expensive so be prepared to invest some bucks into this.  but you don't have to buy hair as long as you need since you can kind of add hair at different points to add length.  <br>   <br>  also on doctered locks there is a tutorial on dread perming...never tried it but it may work.....<br>  <br>  lots of work, but well worth it!!|`|GXM74MGPaa	Yes of course.|`|oJORZebKaa	Of course. You might not get the synthetic look because of course if it's synthetic that means it's mixed with other fabrics or hairs. But yes you can do it with real hair.|`|FQCI3a3Waa	Yes you could with human hair synthetic never looks good|`|1IWg7apBaa	yes, all you have to do is act like it is your own hair.

zlXofrG4aa	Yes, and surface piercings hurt pretty bad.  Make sure wherever you go that you make sure they have experience in surface piercings.  Obviously a piercing parlor will do them for you and they'll cost a pretty penny.  Also make sure they use a 90 degree surface bar.  Surface piercings usually migrate out though, I know from personal experience and from friends, so if you're looking for an alternate but very similar route that has a smaller chance of migrating out check out microdermals.

That shines through.|`|jXvJDDgTaa	well    being fit and with a good body shape    tannes skin    unique outfits    blond hair    beautiful features    blue eyes|`|bITTzzcVaa	keeping good hygene, taking care of themselves, and carrying themselves well.|`|LxcYzV7iaa	hygiene, grooming and confidence amongst other things|`|1DT7OUuHaa	I think people have different ideas of what makes someone "physically beautiful" but here are some examples of people that I find very attractive.   1 ADRIANNA LIMA (she's stunning), Scarlett Johannson, Giselle, Jessica Alba  Zac Efron, Leonardo di Caprio, Brad Pitt   I think someone truly physically beautiful must have   1. good features (esp. their eyes and smiles)  2. great hair  3. physically fit and not too skinny and women must have some curves and guys must have some muscle tone  4. great style  5. and I know that people don't think that this has much to do w/ physical beauty but it really does.  They MUST have confidence (w/out being arrogant) and look like they have a great inner-beauty as well  Who are some people you find physically beautiful?|`|EwtCmQctaa	hate to say it but you cant be physically beautiful until you think that you are beautiful.  Notice that the prettiest girls are the more confident ones, which is why models, actresses, singers etc are attractive! (But obviously their expensive treatments help in the long run too!)  I also think being happy makes someone beautiful ! :D    There's so much needed to be "beautiful", but it all starts on the inside!|`|pDptioSNaa	Upkeep. LOL|`|JF343E2Taa	good hygiene grooming wearing clean clothing and being kind and a big smile|`|tx8iEBgAaa	besides the obvious grooming....    it is all about symmetry of the face. I saw a science study on T.V where scientists took models and regular people and by simulating their face from a child (a baby has a symmetrical face) they found that men found women mostly attractive if her face was balanced and symmetrical and the closest to their baby facial form.... weird huh!??!    just thought I'd share that =)|`|jI2j3wd8aa	whatever u allow it to be. U got to feel beautiful in the inside and that is how u achieve beautiful in the outside. Ofcourse a good HEALTHY diet and some exercise will help too.|`|BLUUQFG4aa	I think confidence plays a major factor. How he or she presents and carries themselves. Of course it's about looks too! Symetrical features play a big role. I think the physical stuff is different based on your own personal liking. Some may find long, blonde straight hair; blue eyes and tan skin attractive. While another may think long black hair, green eyes and fair skin.

idhcqr5Daa	Apply a serum such as Herbal Essences No more Frizz. Remember not to use too much, and start at the ends.   Take a brush and comb it back at the top so that the top of your hair is teased backwards. Then with the brush tease the sides of your hair. With your hands, smooth your crown and spritz heavily with any hairspray. Repeat the brushing and smooth it over with your hands.   Gather your hair with both hands and put it in a high ponytail, smoothing out the bumps carefully while moving your hair up your crown. Do this by flipping your hair upside down and gathering all your hair in one spot. It's helpful to use a paddle brush for this step.   Secure the bun with one of the following methods, depending on the thickness of your hair and the size of the elastic:      Tie your elastic around the center of the circle. It will look like you have a small donut in the middle of your head with hair sticking out from the back of it in all directions.Stick the hair that is sticking out into the same elastic.   Wrap your elastic twice around your hair, then pull your ponytail half-way through the elastic. Pull some bits and pieces out from inside the half-ponytail so it's hanging down. You may also want to leave out wisps around the nape of your neck.   Secure your elastic around your hair tightly into a ponytail. Coil your hair around the base of your ponytail as if you were putting it in a ballerina bun. Flatten the bun to your head and secure with an elastic. Try pinning it with bobby pins- when done well, this helps the look a lot. Pull out bits and pieces and shake your head until you achieve the desired effect.   Pull hair back into a ponytail, then backcomb it (hold the bottom of your ponytail and brush UPWARDS towards the elastic) until it is quite fluffed up, then spray with some hairspray.If your hair is quite long, wrap it around the base of your pony a little,then secure it with an elastic; but if your hair is shorter you can just secure the bun with another elastic after folding the end of your pony back against the beginning. Then gently brush the bun to pull out a few tendrils of hair.   Comb hair back, and make a low bun. Then, make a bun out of the bun. Tie with an elastic, making sure the bunned-bun stays in place, and doesn't tumble out into a ponytail.   Make the left hand grab the pony, and let go of your right hand. Put an elastic (while still holding onto the ponytail with the left hand) around your right wrist. Lift your right hand so that its right by the ponytail. With your left hand grab the elastic on the right hand and pull so it wraps around the pony. Tug the elastic very far and tightly twist, so that the left hand will now be inside the elastic. With the right hand again, tug the elastic to the right so it wraps around but instead of what you did last time, stop in the middle of the dangling hair and twist. Now your right hand should be tight in the pony. With your left hand, grab the elastic off your right wrist and pull so that it stops at the messy buns end.   Accentuate your hairstyle by doing any of the following:      Run your fingers through the front of your hair to loosen it from the elastic and add texture.   Slide in a thin black headband two inches back from your hair line. Slide in a second thin black headband three inches behind the first one. If you have blond hair, use two black headbands or darker colored headbands. If you have brown or black hair, try using white headbands or a different light colored headband.   Mist your entire head with hairspray. While spraying the hairspray make sure you spray it about seven to eight inches away. This will help your messy bun stay put longer.   An alternative might be just to hold your hair in a ponytail (without a hair tie), twist the hair, and coil it around. Then, tie around the coil and after a while, little bits of hair will start falling out! Don't be afraid to experiment- the messy bun can almost be called an art form, and there is no precise way to do it. It's just that - messy.   This can easily be turned into a romantic look by softly curling the pieces as they fall out of the bun so they are like tendrils.   Hair spray helps it stay in place. Don't pull your elastics too tight, as they can break or damage your hair.   Don't use elastic bands. They damage your hair. Instead, use a hair bobble.   Backcombing your hair can be a pain to brush out afterwards but can be made easier by using a paddle brush. But you have to be patient.         x0x0_LEi|`|WZlKy4Vgaa	If you don't want bumps in your hair then make sure to tip your head forward and then back and brush them out.    1. Put your hair up in a normal pony tail.    2. Grab about 1/4 of your pony tail and get a bobble, spin this piece of hair around and make it look a bit static then put around as if your doing a normal bun and bobble this in.    3. Then grab a little section at a time of your pony tail and put them in any direction over and over again. you can either hold these in place with your fingers if you don't like a lot of bobbles in your hair or bobble them in.    4. Finally Pull some bits out and curl these it will look really nice and there's your messy bun.    Another quicker way if your in a hurry...  1. Put your hair in a ponytail again    2. Then get all your fingers on one hand and move all the pony tail around to make it really messy and has a few tangles in it then, it will go very thicker but don't worry.    3. Then put this in a bobble and bits will stick out on there own.    Note-  Your hair will be quite messy when you take it out but this can be brushed out.  Also  Pull some of hair out of the bun and make this stick up and down like a wave and stick it down with a few bobby pins for a very messy look :)    Hope this helps :)|`|adyNCp6eaa	(P.S. DO NOT GO TO http://hair2.cpalead.info/, it is a stupid scam that will probably give your computer a virus! )  Put your hair up and wrap the scrunchie all the way around once, then wrap it around so that it folds over into a bun.(about 2 more times) Then tighten it by separating the bun in half and pulling, making sure that you mostly pull on the end of your hair that is attatched to your head, but at the base of your ponytail. just grab the whole thing in a sloppy way, thats what makes it look "messy". If you want that "hairs sticking out" look, then take the ends that are underneath the bun and pull them around and up so your bun kind of looks like a sun with the ends of your hair radiating out from the base. I call it the "peacock" look. (Peacocks are very beautiful animals lol) Its totally cute, but better if you have hair that is short, like maybe an inch below your shoulder usually works best because more hair sticks out and gives it the messy look if its shorter.
zxwUpCasaa	i have had to dye my hair several times in a row to get back to my natural color before - which is a light ash bown as well. i had these aweful big bleach blonde highlights all over my head and i had to dye it over about 3 times by a hairdresser.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	No once you start dying the only thing you can do is let it grow out..|`|UvLNxiuyaa	Use Color Fix. Products like Color Fix, Color Oops, and Haircolor Remover Kit can be purchased at most drugstores. Color Fix and Color Oops will remove hair dye, restoring hair to its natural color. Haircolor Remover Kit by L'Oreal will strip hair of all dye and prepare it for re-tinting so that you may dye it another shade. Read the packages carefully and choose which is best for you.

r4xRkqzdaa	make up forever HD foundation    if you are going to be taking pictures, makeup forever is for you.  i disagree with the other users saying to use one with sunscreen in it (although i rant on the need for sunscreen) but since you are taking pictures and the ingredient in sunscreen is a light-relecting material- it'll bounce the light from the flash back and make your face look super, super PALE- you do NOT want a sunscreen on for taking pictures.    makeup forever HD is made of large silicon molecules that can't fit into your pores so this makeup is specially designed to even out your skin tone, including any fine lines or discolorations- it's designed to give the 'soft focus' effect for pictures....

kCdISEGqaa	The stretch marks, yes, but, you will still be able to see the stretch marks, they will just be colored.  Modern machines and techniques make it possible to tattoo over stretch marks.  Make sure you go to an experienced artist, because you can go to deep on stretch marks, and cause them to heal poorly.  The keloid, no, they won't hold the ink.  Smaller scars can be worked on, but the keloids are too large and are raised too high.  Chris Garver did a tattoo on a woman on the show Miami Ink whose back was covered with keloids.  He worked the tattoo around the scars and make id look very elegant.  Talk to your artist, they will be able to make it work.  Good luck and have fun with it!!!|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes.

xm0kLvnLaa	Avocados every time. Unfortunately I just take one look at them and i'm put off, so if you feel the same as me, instead of eating them, you can apply them straight to your hair in paste form, leave for 15mins and rinse off. You can do the same for a face mask. Another hair recipe that you don't eat but actually apply is:   ~Honey and Oil Mask~  2 tbsp honey  1/3 cup olive oil     Beat honey into oil in small bowl.  Apply to hair, concentrating on ends.  Wrap hair in a hot towel for 30 minutes. Be sure to rinse thoroughly as mixture will be sticky.     Or    ~Eggs and More Mask~  1 egg  1 tsp honey  2 tbsp olive oil    Beat the egg into the honey then beat in the oil.  Shampoo hair, rinse, then apply mixture to hair and scalp.  Massage for 5 minutes, then rinse well.    Things to actually ingest are leafy vegetables which are rich in iron which is fantastic for shiny hair.

Just keep within the recommended daily allowances and make sure you drink plenty of fluids, exercise and enjoy the outdoors.

Water helps flush those toxins right out of your body... I've heard it called the "magic eraser" because of the effect it has on your skin.  Ideally, you should be drinking half your body weight in ounces of water.  So, if you weigh 130 lbs, then you should be drinking at least 65oz of water every day.      It works wonders for your skin and hair, and your nails will be much stronger, too!|`|yULWldR4aa	lots of water for clear skin. vitamin C?|`|w01ub95Jaa	water, fruits and vegetables|`|fbc51fefdf8f90a690cd87fb91f16194aa	The minerals and vitamins that help most with skin and hair are: Vitamin A, B vitamins, and zinc.

It's hard to explain, but....lol.|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Hair extensions are some of the most exciting beauty products to experiment with: using extensions, you can instantly transform your look and actually experience what another hairstyle would be like from day to day.    Typical glue-in and *shudder* weave types of extensions are difficult both to put in and get out of, and its best to have a professional do either. The solution lies in clip-ins, which have improved immensely since their days as a Halloween party alternative to a bad wig.    Heres a guide on how to put in clip-on extensions all by your resourceful little self (or with a friend, who may be useful here):      Find the right extensions. We recommend human hair clip-ins over synthetics, since theyre reusable and can be styled just like natural hair. Texture (wavy, straight, thick, fine) is the most important element in picking extensions, since color blends easily as long as you choose something relatively close - but curly or wavy extensions will never blend with straight hair. We like Jessica Simpson hair.do clip-in extensions.   Prep the extensions. No matter the length of your extensions, youre going to have to cut them to look natural. First, measure an extension by holding it up to the top of your ears and choosing where youd like the extension to end. Then cut to that length. Repeat the process, measuring and cutting extensions all the way down to the nape of your neck, so that the ends fall evenly. (Use Step 3 below to figure out how many to cut at each length, and lay them out on a table so you can keep them straight.)   Put them in already! First, put hair up in a high ponytail, leaving out a small layer of hair at the base. Spritz a little hairspray at the root of this section and tease the roots slightly to prevent the extensions from slipping. Then place the first clip-ins here, covering from side to side but leaving approximately 1 room on both sides of your hair. Continue as follows:  - 1 1/2 up from the lowest section (about even with your earlobes), with the same application as the first section;  -2 up from that section (slightly above the tops of your ears), applying in 3 close layers for extra volume, since hair here is naturally thicker;  - On both sides of your head, at an even level with the crown, putting only 1 extension on each side at a 45 degree angle;  - And finally, one clip-in on each side about 3 up from the tops of your ears, leaving at least 1 from the front of your hairline.   Take care of your hair. Some tips on clip-in extension maintenance:  - Dont sleep in your clip-ins.  - To prolong the life of extensions, straighten after each use.  - Use a heat protection spray when heat styling.  - A complete shampoo and treatment can be applied once a month, if needed: apply diluted shampoo and very gently stroke through the hair from root to tip, keeping hands flat. Rinse with a shower head & repeat with conditioner. Keep the top clip part of the extension dry. Avoid tangles and allow hair to drip dry naturally overnight. Once dry, gently comb through the hair starting at the tips.  - Do not comb hair when wet.|`|yoM5iFDpaa	Ive never had clip ins so im not sure but i have had theweave and micro loops and neither have ruined my hair if anything they have encouraged my hair to grow.|`|NOcrhKnaaa	Yes the clip in ones are great, and last a long time too well thats if you take care of them and dont just leave them lying around anywhere.  I would get human hair ones as they look much better than the cheap fake synthetic ones.|`|p824592Baa	clip in ones are great, i use them all the time. A tip would be to tease/back-comb the hair slightly where the clips lock in as it gives support to them and even if you pull on them they won't come out :)|`|5cDVQED5aa	clip ins are great as a hairdresser myself i use them and would recommend clip in's over the glued in one's. so long as you get real hair and a thick enough set then they will b great. they r cost effective because the dont grow out like the glue in ones do and u wont have to keep payin loads of money to get the roots on them done.   proper extensions ie glue in ones put alot of stress in the root of the hair, which is not good in the long run if used constantly they can leave u with bold patches, ie victoria beckham was shown i magazines with really bad hair after havin her extensions taken out, i think that is y she had all her hair cut off. so go for clip in's PHAB WHOLESALE SALE BRILLIANT ONES (HAIRRAISERS CLIP IN EXTENSIONS) check them out on google|`|m9UNLTH6aa	I haven't ever used the clip in extensions, but the real one will break your hair off at the scalp.

They're glued in and just like normal hair (they are human hair extensions) you need to make sure you're treating them right, heat protector etc or they'll just go dry and horrible.

Strands use techniques that apply 20 to 50 strands of synthetic or natural hair to your own hair by weaving, heat fusing, gluing, clamping, or using waxes and polymers.

tESdl7gbaa	I have only ever tried Dior's airbrush foundation - and I hated it. The colour for shade 03 was intensley dark and because it was a spray foundation the consistency wasn't smooth and hard to control. There was no way you could spray it on your face and not blend, so therefore you had to spray it on your hand and apply - so what was the point in a spray nozzle at all, when you usually apply foundation to your hand in the first place? If you buy this, your gonna be paying more for the packaging rather than the foundation.<br>  <br>  I have never tried any other Dior foundation sorry, but for your second question - its not ridiculous at all. Im fourteen and I use benefit and mac on a daily basis, I think over all it looks better, and lasts longer and is way more worth the money than any old drug store stuff. But then again, I wouldn't hate on anybody who used drug store stuff, because some people can't afford high end brands and other just prefer the foundations there.<br>  <br>  Personally I've never had sucess with a drugstore foundation, but some people do - make up is very subjective.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	none the name dont make it good|`|kmAMgkiraa	It is ridiculous especially in this economy. But if you get the Dior foundation with the moisturizer and spf in it  it's good. But I use Rimmel foundation cause it works, stays on all day, and doesn't cause break outs.

C4cqGj0waa	they have a great little tool in the body shop that costs about three pounds and gets rid of them with practically no pain and no nasty scars :)|`|FMTuvujXaa	Wash your face often, make sure its not oily as it clogs pore and u end up having blackheads first off.     Now, take a walk to ur nearest pharmacy and get a Proper face scrub(i'd suggest St. Ive's Apricot Scrub - Blemish control scrub) try that and u will see the difference straight away.     Oh, lastly get a pimple remover. Dont use ur nails to pinch them out!    Good luck!    p.s : By the way Blackhead removing strips dont work, dont waste ur money...|`|4vhvagF5aa	1.use bio spore strips.  2.permanent is laser.|`|9MtKzSE8aa	the best thing to do is use pore strips however sometimes they dont work so i tend to just boil some water and pour into a bowl and let the steam cover ur face, and then use the strips|`|0vX9yIoQaa	Mix rice powder and orange juice to form a paste. Apply on the face and neck. Let it dry and wash it off.|`|NiRSOC3yaa	Use an exfoliater  Or...  Steam your face(By leaning over a boiling hot bowl of water)  Be very careful though!    X|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Be sure to maintain a healthy beauty regimen.  Wash your face everyday with standard soap, along with a toner that will unclog pores.  I suggest to use a cleanser every few days.  Next, moisturize your skin with an oil-free lotion.  Whenever you wear makeup, make sure to take it off with a remover, not just water.  This prevents oil and dirt buildup, which causes zits.  Maintaining a healthy diet always helps.  Get your daily foods and vitamins from each food group.  As well, be sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep to leave you looking bright and refreshed.|`|lTbZeGiYaa	Lots of water & healthy eating - Cliche, maybe, but its so true.  What you put into your body shows on the outside.  Simple as that.  If you eat lots of greasy crap, your skin is not going to look as good as it would if you ate more veggies and drank more water.      Dont bother with a pore strip - First of all, theyre basically useless for getting rid of anything thats stuck deep in your pores.  Second of all, they can actually damage your skin!  I know these things look like miracle products, but save your money because they arent really going to help.     Do a clay mask once a week - This is only for those of you with oily or combination skin.  Dry skin, obviously, needs all the oil it can get.  Blackheads are partially caused by excess oil on your face, so if you have greasy skin, a good quality clay mask will help sop up some of the grease and keep your pores clearer.  Using it once a week is enough - you dont want to over-dry your skin, because this could lead to even more problems!     Squeeze, but do it carefully! - This is one situation where picking your face may actually help instead of making things worse.  Dont take this as permission to pick at your face all you want!  There is a right and a wrong way to squeeze blackheads and its really important that you do it the right way.      First, wash your face with a gentle cleanser. (I like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.)  Next, cover your face with a warm, wet cloth for 10 to 15 minutes.  Pat your face dry, then wrap tissues around your fingers to prevent slippage.  Use GENTLE pressure to press down then up around the sides of the blackhead.  If nothing happens after one or two tries, stop.  That means the blackhead isnt ready to come out yet.  Whatever you do, dont pinch, use your nails or press too hard.  This can damage your skin and might even lead to scars!|`|GqRNBTV9aa	a cleansing facial helps and if your local gym has one try using the sauna once or twice a week. I'm told it works wonders.|`|ZKw46efXaa	well i use the pore strips and they seem to work for me! doesnt get the really tough ones out though!    lean over a bowl of boiling hot water to steam your face, that will open the pores and make it easier to get them out!|`|idhcqr5Daa	AHAs  Use creams containing AHA's (Alpha Hydroxyl Fruit acids) like glyco-creams that will clear away any dead skin cells and "expose" the blackhead. Use the AHA's every 3 days or so.         Lime Juice  Make a lotion with equal parts of lime juice, almond oil and glycerin and apply on the face. It will not only cure blackheads but the discoloring spots on the face too.         Honey  Warm a little honey and apply on the trouble area.   Wash off after 10-15 minutes.         Egg White  Beat an egg white.   Add 1 tsp honey.   With a cotton swab apply on the face and leave for half an hour.   Rinse with warm water and pat it dry.   Rub cooking oil on your face and take a cloth and rub it off.         Olive or almond oil  Rinse your face with warm water to open your pores.   Generously saturate a section of washcloth with olive or almond oil.   Place a dab of toothpaste (not the gel kind) on the oily washcloth.   Gently and thoroughly rub the toothpaste over your nose with the oily cloth. Do it twice if you have a lot of blackheads.   Massage it into your whole face if you like. Add more oil or toothpaste as necessary.   Wait about 5 minutes, then rinse your face thoroughly with hot water and a clean washcloth.         Steam and moisturizer  Put a hot towel over your face for 10 minutes.   If you let it sit then the black heads can come to the surface.   Wash with warm water and soap.   Close pores with cold water and apply oil-free moisturizer.   Then rub alcohol on it for five minutes         Gatorade  Mix gatorade and vodka(any type is fine) and pour over blackheads. Rinse after 10=15 minutes and avoid touching them.    Avoid washing the face with soaps more than twice a day. Instead wash your face often with plain water splashes.   Keep your hair away from your face. Greasy hair and skin don't go together, and hair can spread infection.   Sunshine or ultra-violet light encourages skin peeling, and so helps to clear blocked pores. For this reason, sunbathing or use of sun-beds in moderation can be helpful. (Please note that continuous peeling has been linked to skin cancer.)   Always use oil-free mosturizer because you don't want to clog your pores even more.   If irratation with any product occurs, contact any help line that may be associated with it ( usually found on the back of the products)and discontinue using the product immediately.    x0x0_LEi|`|OeALoYSHaa	use biore pore strips, they work the best. washes and scrubs dont work at all (on me atleast)|`|ijeninncaa	The only way to permanently do it it through laser surgery.  But to prevent it, wash your face regularly to prevent blocked up pores.

nKwcGLQraa	some peopel just his puberty earlier than others :/. thats life. but eventually its gonna happen to everybody!    if it really bothers her, she can shave her armpits and wax her upperlip (but that really hurts). she could also bleach her upperlip if its the darkhair that makes it so visible.|`|gRtmFa1maa	Everyone has some hair...but usually not so obvious that they get teased for it.    She needs to have it waxed off. You can go to the drugstore and get kits. Get one and take her into the bathroom and do it. (rip  it off quickly...its way better that way). Do it on a Friday night because the first couple time her skin may get irritated...so it may be red and take a day or so to fade away. Please don't shave it.    Your mom sees your sister as her baby and probably doesn't want to admit that she needs to deal with these adolescent issues. My mom wouldn't let me shave...so I finally took one of her razors and did it anyway. Once you do it...its done. Then you just have to maintain.|`|yg237qWSaa	that's not a problem, just shave it :D ad about that upperlip,, new laser technologies helps you to remove it,, it's expensive after all,, but it minimizes the hair,, just visit the dermatologist|`|EX1GjjJCaa	Well, not all girls have it.

Your sister needs to talk to your mom about it, though-at her age she will need adult guidance and help to choose the best way for her.
SkCM55lMaa	Since its snowing, i'd say a really nice long sleeved top thats a bit dressy but no too over the top. I would also put on a couple layers underneath to keep warm. And then over the nice top a nice warm jacket or cardi. Then a nice scarf. (:    Oh and of course skinny jeans and nice boots. Maybe even heeled ankle boots or heeled high boots over your jeans.     If you want you could even add a knitted beret; http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/6b/...    hope that helps  and have fun at the opera!    x|`|gQtbwpyCaa	going outy top lol skinny jeans with a nice pair of high boots :)|`|YU8fBkUKaa	Top and Jeans with shoes.  http://www.funfilms.in/

OBRW9JZhaa	I also collect clothes, specifically vintage like the ones in this ebay store: http://stores.ebay.com/VeritableVintage-...    As long your hobby is hurting you in anyway like you're missing work or hanging out with people to hit a sale or you're buying clothes that will put you into debt, I don't see what the problem is, of course this is coming from a fellow hobbyist but I think that maybe you just need to find other people with the same passion for clothes that you have. Like a forum, "the purse forum" has a really fun section for clothing or maybe you could start a group in your town that gets together at stores and discusses clothing. Finding people that share your interests will help you dismiss any negative comments from the uneducated factions that do not understand the beauty of garments.|`|adyNCp6eaa	Whoever is saying those things to you are jerks. If they are your friends, then they are not your REAL friends. My motto is "People can think what they want to think, but I don't care" People like that are probably just jealous that you have the money to have a "collection" of clothes. I know I am, but i'm not gonna criticize you for it. Just ignore those people because they arent worth your time. Life is too short, dont waste the time you have on negative things, thats what makes people depressed.

Mix a banana and honey together.<br>  Add a few drops of juice from an orange or a lemon. <br>  Apply to face for 15 minutes before rinsing with a cool washcloth or a steaming warm washcloth. (works really well!)<br>  <br>  3. Mash an avocado in a bowl, then stir in honey.<br>  Apply to skin and leave for 10 minutes. <br>  Rinse face with a cool washcloth.

i7ZArzliaa	Are you asking about using your Tekken ID Card?  And if so, where are you from?  Japan and North America (and assumingly other countries) use a different system for their character customizations.    Or are you just simply looking for pictures?  I'll check back later to see if you added more details and edit my answer accordingly. :)    (??)    Cheers,  Chris.    ==========    Edit: Well, if it's anything the same like that of the TekkenNet cards here in Japan, it should be in  (Japanese kanji for "Feet" or "Legs").    If you went through that, could it be you may have missed Asuka's bare feet option?  Or maybe you skipped a page in the costume list?

I think the bright red would look really nice though!
idhcqr5Daa	Wash your face regularly to remove away dirt and grime.   Use toner after cleansing your face to tighten those pores   Apply foundation to hide open pores. Use a good quality foundation with sunscreen. Foundation is actually beneficial for the skin, because it acts like a protective layer between your face and the elements.   Wash off the foundation as soon as you reach home with face wash, and follow up with toner. Clean and Clear is a good face wash for oily skin. Open pores on your nose may mean that you have a tendency to develop blackheads. If this is the case, get your blackheads removed reguarly with the help of blackhead removal strips.   Roll ice all over your face.   Using a face scrub on your nose daily helps prevent the formation of blackheads.         x0x0_LEi|`|6equzzThaa	my mum has this cream called derma genesis by loreal and you really can see the difference on her face. try it. you never know it might work....|`|FE2uFIoWaa	First of all it is very important for you to use a skin care regimen.

jrB6z23Yaa	I would suggest get it tested from a jeweller.    Dhruvika  http://www.myjewelersplace.com|`|jXvJDDgTaa	go to a silver shop|`|bITTzzcVaa	Silver, if it has a number, doesnt mean much.    A way to tell if it is real, it wont turn your finer green, brown, or leave a dark ring on your finger.    It doesnt really matter if Silver is real or not, just dont put it in ring cleaner. It will tarnish.
RChBFKdWaa	1. I love makeup, i think it's great. it enhances peoples appearance, and can sometimes correct things people don't like on their face, and none of it is damaging unless you apply it badly/roughly or if you get products that are very oily.  2. hmm I think that is true. MAC is very very good, so many different products and colours and such. estee lauder has the best foundation shades for me, all the cheap brands dont match my skin at all. but www.coastalscents.com has pretty good stuff too. alot of it is comparable to MAC.  3. sheseido moisturizer and hydration lotion and cleanser all work for me, toners work for me too. bio white works well to get rid of acne scars and such. i've tried a cream that goes under eyes to get rid of dark circles but that doesnt work, i forget what its called sorry.  4. i have problems finding the right shade foundation and concealer. i'm allergic to the foundation brush from revlon and also some facial cleansing wipes irritate my skin but nivea is good for me.|`|u7o75zipaa	1. I think it's just personal choice, but it's okay as long as you use it in moderation, and remove it at night.  2. Not at all. My favourite body moisturiser is available at 99p for a reasonable sized pot. (Cyclax Cocoa Butter). It's really good, much better than some more expensive one's I've tried.  3. I don't know about anti-age and anti-wrinkle etc. cause I'm too young, but some definitely help make your skin softer.  4. Yeah, I'm fine with them. Never had any problems.|`|FplTPoAyaa	1. It can be a good idea if you use quality products and clean your face every night to remove it.  2. I don't always believe that a higher price means higher quality.  There are many inexpensive products on the market that are of good quality, such as L'Oreal or Physicians Formula.  3. I personally haven't had much luck with the effectiveness of anti-aging make-up, but I do find that the moisturizers and creams are helpful.  4. I wear make-up daily and have never had any adverse effects from it, other than I tend to have dry skin, and I need to apply moisturizer beneath my make-up to keep it from caking.|`|rfFCPjr5aa	If you require this for research (I am a male 36yrs old married 2 kids)    1. Good idea - but in moderation;  2. Don't know, but I don't think this is necessarily true.  3. Yes  4. I use creams for dry skin, and cologne or eau de toilette as well as natural product spefically tea tree oil - Tea tree solves all problems. Never had any problems with cosmetics.|`|FE2uFIoWaa	1. I think wearing make-up is not a bad idea.  It is very important to know the proper way to wear it and to cleanse your skin to keep it healthy.  Natural make-up with only natural ingredients that will not harm your skin is something to think about.  2. The more expensive does not necessarily mean the better.  Again you have to use what works for you and what is right for your skin.  There are times that the mark-up is high on cosmetics because there are so many people involved in getting the product on the shelf for us.  3. I do believe that there are product that will make the skin soft and that do work.  When thinking about skin we have to thin about our overall health.  What we put in our bodies have a huge effect on our skin.  4.  I am happy using cosmetic product.  I am a person that needs a very good moisturizer.  I have had problems in the past with skin care.  I now use all natural skin care products and I am so pleased with the results.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	I think they are a waste of money and time.  Althought it looks like im wearing makeup in my picture, its just a trick of light from using a graphics program.   I never wear makeup, foundation, etc and only use moisturiser as required, never on a daily basis.  The only reason so many girls use all this rubbish is because their magazines tell them to. They are just being exploited for their money.  I have heard of girls as young as 20 using anti-wrinkle, anti-aging products! EEHHHH??? Im 30 and I know if you don;t use any of this rubbish you will have better skin in the long term.    most guys don't use this stuff, so don't see why girls feel they HAVE to use it.
iQZpv42raa	Animals are to be eaten and used in any needed manner.In nature predators eat smaller animals and nobody worries.Humans do it in most humane way: we don't kill rare species, because we raise our own population,animals in fur farmers are well-fed and taken care, otherwise fur will be low quality,anyway human needs meet, so it is no difference between breeding animals for fur or for meet, fur industry provides income for a lot of workers.  In nature survival of species is more important then survival of one particular animal, so by breeding animals for our needs we "do good" for populations, since we increase its number.  I was abused once because of wearing fur coat.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Im totally against fur wearing, as i don't believe animals should be killed so we can wear something then throw it away after wearing it a few times, when we already can make so many things without having to kill animals in the most inhumane way.

MX3wOs1vaa	Laser is not considered permanent.  Its actually considered "Hair Reduction".  Also with Laser, it works best on dark coarse hair.  If you have fine and lightly colored hair, this is not the best option for you.  If you want something permanent, you will have to go with Electrolysis. Waxing is another alternative and of course a cheaper option.  It does hurt slightly.  It can last 4 to 6 weeks and after a while the hair will be come finer.  It also exfoliates the top layer of the skin which is good.  Hope I helped!|`|tX0Iczsaaa	wax.|`|kKEcR4Rtaa	you should have kept your sessions consitant untill you notice a change, why don't you go back to have another consultation or try electrolysis.

There is a new product that just came out on the market and was featured in Allure Magazine this month by a company called Arbonne. I have been using it for the past week and it really makes my face feel so clean and soft. The lotion is so light you don't even feel it on your face. I would recomment this product for the teen to 30 something group for sure.|`|yTNk4b7Raa	Apparently it makes pores look smaller and reduced if you fill your sink, ( wash basin ) with hot water, but not to hot and hold your face about 4 - 8 centimeters from the water and let the steam off the water go on to your face, and stay there for 2-4 minutes your choice. then when done pat dry your face. do this for a week or everyday if you want smooth skin.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	I think there are products on the market for this; check Duane Reade's or RiteAid.|`|AA10755311	wash your face in hot water, rinse well and then splash cold water on|`|RdvW90GPaa	use pore minimiser cream or cover up with make up.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	wash your face with COLD wate that works

Y32zA5Mfaa	Yes eye drops may work.  However, I would consult an eye doctor before using any brand long term.  Some brands used for long periods of time can harm your eyes.  Your eye doctor will be able to give you more information about which ones are safe.  For allergy eye drops, I know that Opcon-A is safe, while Visine is not (according to my eye doctor).   Not sure about regular eye drops though.<br>  <br>  Are you spending lots of time on the computer?

qkLqlW4Caa	okay so the guy is supposed to pay and (like ticket and dinner) and some places for good dresses are DEBS and macy's :)|`|6359LQLNaa	it never hurts to bring a little bit of money<br>  but i think that the guy pays for everything since he's inviting you. when he pays for the ticket he pays for the dinner supplied as well.<br>  <br>  what you need to worry about is<br>  1. buying a dress, shoes, bag, <br>  2. buying a garter (these are the things you put around your legs under your dress, at the end of the night the guy gets to keep it and he's supposed to put it around his rearview mirror in his car)<br>  3. geting a boutoneer (idk how to spell that but its the flower you get for the guy)<br>  <br>  <br>  for a good website for dresses go to www.simplydresses.com or www.tiza.com<br>  i went to prom as a sophomore last year too! its so much fun.|`|6c0624b9f9ca68818c8a837831ae4cfcaa	Prom is a social gathering, as far as I know everything has already been paid in the school, all you have to do is enjoy the moment, dance with friends or lovers, etc. <br>  I don't really bring any money in prom O_O because as I've said, the food has been paid for and my date has a car to fetch me and drive me back home and basically there is nothing to buy on a Prom <br>  <br>  for some 2009 affordable prom dresses you can try checking out <br>  <a href="http://www.therosedress.com/Prom/Prom_Dresses.asp?nopg=1&action=1&search=&sort=" rel="nofollow">http://www.therosedress.com/Prom/Prom_Dr...</a><br>  or if you're willing to spend much try<br>  <a href="http://www.therosedress.com/Prom/Alyce_Designs_Prom_Dresses.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.therosedress.com/Prom/Alyce_D...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun|`|6FSdrlCtaa	they buy condoms|`|iPje1iyGaa	DEB and stors like JCPenney or Macy's are good places to get dresses that are less than $200.  If you don't mind spending more than that, you can get a dress from any Wedding Dress shop or boutique.<br>  <br>  You don't need to bring money because the guy is expected to pay for dinner and everything.  If you feel that is not fair, talk to your date about splitting the ticket cost or dinner.<br>  <br>  If you want to go traditional, buy a garter and give it to your date at the end of the night.  (He should give you a bowtie or necktie in return).  Get your hair and nails done, or just do them yourself.<br>  <br>  Most of all, just be sure you're comfortable in your dress, hair, and makeup and have fun!|`|xV3rBGWzaa	usually the guy pays for the ticket but with the economy these days who knows the situation.  Eitherr way you have to ask soon because one of you needs to purchase the ticket, so i would just ask.  Prom usually is like 60 bucks and includes dinner and drinks.  It is usually at a fancy restaurant and then a dance hall.  i would bring some money just in case cuz i am not certain how they do it where you live.  you need to get your dress and tell him the color, beccause his choice of clothes should match yours and also he will get your a corsage to match your dress and you need to get him a a flower too called a boutienner.  It is like 15 bucks tops from your local florist or even the florist at your grocery store, order 3 days before at least.  <br>  <br>  Usually one person in a friend group will host the party which means their parents are in charge of getting a limo if everyone wants that and they collect all the money for that from everyone and i think the guy and girl should both pay for that, unless the guy says specifically he wants to pay.  Then all the friends  and their parents meet at that host house and take pictures before and with the limo and pictures are also taking for exchanging the flowers.  he should get you a wrist corsage, since they are easier to wear, you pin his on and look on the internet there are many videos on how to pin a boutinner on. you drive around for a few hours in the limo which usuallky has club lights, karoke, a tV and you can bring your own musci and the limo stops wherever you ask it to for picture taking like at a beach etc.  then the limo take you to the prom.  it costs more to have the limo come back and take everhyone back to the host house so usually parents pick up the kids.     Dillards is a place to find great discounts on dresses, and in store you find the best deal.  We always paid 40-60% on our dresses.  if you want one of those more expensive ones (400.00) then go to your local bridal shop.  you find the dress you want on the internet and they measure you and order the dress and they will not order the dress if anyone else has ordered it so there will not be girls wearing the same dress.  Only about 1/4 of the girls wear the more fancy dresses and the rest wear the longer gowns that are 150 or less and you can find them for way less.  <br>  <br>  One thing for prom is you have to go get some fake nails put on, get an updo hairstyle and go get your make up done free at macy's or like department store.  Prom is the dance you go over the top compared to middle school dances, you want to shine and find the most sparkly fake diamond like jewelry sets.  <br>  <br>  i dont think the boy should pay for everything unless he offers to but go into it offering to pitch in.   The economy is bad, many kids might not be working yet and their parents might not be able to afford it.  <br>  <br>  also usually at prom they have a profession photographer taking prom pictures of the couples.  i would take extra money for that because those pictures are great to look back on in life.|`|v2lqFx0Zaa	the guy should pay. it's a common knowlege thing....especially for them, but if you want, take a few bucks just in case.

SLSoHM25aa	no it is not damaging to re color your hair so soon only if you do not have a lot of past color on your hair. If this was the first time you colored you'll be fine. i would say if it came out to dark than your hair is porous and soaked up the dark color, before you go and re color try this take dish soap and your shampoo and wash your hair in the dish soap leave it in for 10 to 15 min rinse out then shampoo with your regular shampoo and condition. I would leave the conditioner in for a little while to re hydrate the hair. the dish soap is strong and will pull out the excess dye that is left in the hair, no extra salon visit needed.|`|Ocyrox5baa	I would wait a couple of weeks and use good shampoo and conditioner in the meantime.

Y6YaMR34aa	OMG! your eyebrows are practically perfect! I would kill for natural eyebrows like that! Your friend really has problems. If she waxes her eyebrows that means she has insecurities about it or something. DOnt listen. If anything pluck a little under the brow but not to much! and get a light brown eyeliner and rub a little on the the brow and smudge it in. If you really need to do that stuff. Anyways rock it out Girlie!|`|GHeqcovHaa	Your eyebrows look great; your friend is so rude for saying that they don't! You are lucky that they are blond, because you don't have to wax. If I were you, I would just pluck the few hairs on the bottom. Don't pluck above! If you do, it ruins the natural brow shape. If you need more help, you can look online, or just get a white eyeliner pencil and outline how you want your eyebrows to look. Then, pluck whatever is below that (don't worry if you mess up badly, because they grow back pretty fast). If you are still unsure, get them either done by someone you know that has nice eyebrows that they do themselves, or just go to a salon. Don't worry, and good luck! =]|`|maqCRmehaa	I have to agree that your eyebrows are fine!  If you want to shape them up a little I would go to a salon the first time and let them do it.  That way you won't get them messed up!  From there you can maintain what they did by plucking the hairs as they grow in or keep getting them waxed.  The only think they would do with your brows is take the stray hairs out from under the arch.  Tell your friend to take a hike.  I can't figure out why some people are so obnoxious.|`|KQPDtrw8aa	you are very cute and natural the way you are.

My experience with conditioners is that they are best when combined with shampoo, as you can have a shorter shower and not worry too muhc about not washing it out.|`|OUGIEld6aa	I bought some Vo8 or V8 shampoo i think its called, because it caught my eye at $1 at CVS. I tried it, and it actually worked great! It has natural fruit and vegetable infusions and it worked just as well as anyother proffesional shampoo i used. Just remember that after rinsing THOROUGHLY of conditioner, run a brush through it while you're still in the shower and you'll be fine!<br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|fG08uYGEaa	Garnier is what I use every day.

I got my tounge peirced on my day off =)|`|VnCEjThKaa	Um..you don't sound too sure if you want one. If you go into a medical field you may be asked to cover it up. Consider location. Also if you get one ask for a new needle or whatever and watch them open up a new package; that way its clean. Your buying the product so they have to suit the customer- make sure its sanitary. Personally, I think you need to put more thought behind it rather than just going off on a whimsical decision. Consider a loss or gain in weight when determining location as well. If you do something in chinese or another language- confirm that it means what you think it means. Just some tips.

rf6MSng5aa	Practice Practice Practice. It takes a while to get used to. You can find a lot of tutorials on Youtube on how to apply liquid eyeliner.<br>  Here are some :<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klsgXpHzHKI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klsgXpHzH...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdp_UAvA1zk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdp_UAvA1...</a>|`|u7o75zipaa	First, invest in a good eyeliner - I recommend Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Liner. It's ￡4.99, and that little bottle lasts ages :) It has a good applicating brush too.<br>  <br>  If you're putting it on your eyelid, start on the inside and slowly sweep to the outside of you eyelid. Don't worry if you make the line thicker than intended.<br>  <br>  Fix your mistakes. Use a make-up remover wipe, or a cotton bud with make up remover on it to carefully wipe off excess eyeliner.<br>  <br>  If you're applying it on the bottom lip, apply it just above your lower lashes, but no on the inside of the lip or it'll go into the water line and sting a bit. Start on the inside and work out the way, again taking your time and wiping off any excess.<br>  <br>  You WILL get better the more you do it, so persevere :) Once you've mastered it, it will be a piece of cake.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Rest your elbow on a shelf or something similar where you can see the mirror so that you get an even line rather than a shaky freehand one.|`|VlTGV9DUaa	the best eyeliner ive used it Rimmel Exaggerate, the colour stays true all day and it NEVER smudges. an i wear it everyday, also the applicator makes it so easy an precise to apply!<br>  <br>  tilt ur head back, pull ur eyelid out to the side slightly then starting at the inner corner draw a smooth line across getting slightly thicker as the line goes along. if u cant draw one smooth line do small dashes then join them together, with liquid liner-practice makes perfect! u cant expect it to go great the first few times but after a while it gets easy! i use to take ages tryna get both eyes the same and the line perfect an it'd still look odd! but now it takes me no time atall!<br>  <br>  <br>  i dont wear this much eyeliner anymore, its way too much lol. but im jus showin u how i use to do it:<br>  <a href="http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/89/l_f8c36050b8a440ce042f7bc8d8e834ea.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a><br>  <br>  i wear it like this now, using that Rimmel Eyeliner on my upper lashline, white pencil liner on my waterline, curl lashes and use lengthening mascara (L'oreal Telescopic) really makes eyes open an bright:<br>  <a href="http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/37/l_347e67fcd99a4944800f29e6080502e7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a>|`|qYTYcVGGaa	liquid eyeliner looks good with the "winged" eyeliner look|`|5vFGO57Kaa	Use the ones that have an applicator like a felt tip pen.  The brush ones are very tricky.  Or maybe I'm just useless!!|`|23Zz2yrPaa	Be patient!|`|AA10011909	i find it a lot easier to apply liquid liner when you have something to trace, cause it's hard to just do it freehand if you're not used to it.  So get a pencil liner in the same color as your liquid liner and put that on first, and then just trace over it with the liquid liner once you have it the way you want it to look.<br>  <br>  it helps because it gives you a guideline to follow so its not as hard to apply, but also, giving it a base coat (the pencil liner) will make it last longer throughout your day :]|`|PxxpIW75aa	What ever you do, do not stretch your eyelied taut, this will cause a wrirkled line instead of smooth. Try a felt, (inkwell eyeliner like ULTA) don't go with black if you are light skined.|`|YkNBotofaa	if it's gona go on your eyelid:<br>  do a medium thick line <br>  then with a wet q-tip fix it to how you want it before it dries|`|4P0Gmsa8aa	uhmmm...take ur time, it takes getting used too. dont put it on ur inner lids on the bottom. stay close to the lash line|`|uQO1Lx9Iaa	wear it on the inside rims ...it looks way better
adyNCp6eaa	Lotion and then vaseline. Chapstick actually makes chapped lips worse, it gets you addicted. It hydrates your lips for like an hour, and then your saliva glands stop making saliva for your lips to keep them hydrated because you dont need it. Then the chapstick wears off, and they are dry again, and then you, what? put on more chapstick! its a neverending cycle, but lotion and then vaseline helps keep your lips hydrated for longer, and then you just have to leave your lips alone for like a week, dont put anything on them, they might get a little dry, but your saliva glands will soon start working again and you will have normal hydrated lips. Do not lick lips either! that is even WORSE than chapstick.|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Put some water on your toothbrush and rub your lips in a circle with the toothbrush. The dead skin will go and then put some lip balm or something on. Make sure you only put chapstick/ vaseline on your lips about every 3 days or they will be addicted and get cracked again.|`|HxbLwCEKaa	My trick works great for me.    After a bath or after washing your face, scrub your lips with a towel and then apply a small amount of body lotion/moisturiser. Do this everytime you wash and your lips will be nice and soft.|`|xhjSPd0uaa	NO NOT VASELINE  i duno why everyone recommends this for chapped lips, it doesnt moisturise them an heal them, all it does it stop them getting even more chapped!    mix small amount of sugar & olive oil in a pot/cup/small bowl til its a gritty paste, using your finger or a toothbrush, gently brush this in circular motions on your lips, splash with cold water then apply olive oil on its own, when this has soaked in (it soaks into the skin very quickly) apply aloot of lip balm.     coloured/sweet flavoured lip balms are not good at getting rid of chapped lips, the best lip balms i have found are:    *L'oreal Pastel Repair Conditioning Lip Cream  *Burt's Bees Honey (is the best at moisturising out of all the burts bees lip balms)  Nivea Lip Care (the blue one)  Blistex Intensive Moisturizer  Paul & Joe Milky Lip Treatment      ive tried over 300 different lip balms.|`|BKOgIfwHaa	Hi There I am gonna have to agree with the last comment I see on here. CARMEX is absolutely awesome lip balm and use it as often as necessary and if you like the glossy lip balms or flavoured you can use them as well. Be sure to treat your lips well before bed!!!|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Gently scrub the dead skin off with a tooth brush and apply vaseline as often as needed.|`|jTNlDNBPaa	vaseline.  your lips seem like they need a good exvoliating.  (: x|`|wd87J7Vsaa	Maybe you should switch lip products. The new Nivea chapstick is awesome!|`|hGojk9UGaa	I really used to suffer from this and my lips used to be so chapped they'd bleed, but someone introduced me to Vaseline Lip Therapy (comes in small round tins) and it has totally cleared up the problem. I do make sure I have one near me at all times and apply it whenever my lips feel dry. Works a treat and I haven't suffered from flaky lips for the 6 years I've used it. Normal vaseline works just as well.  Hope this helps|`|067in9BMaa	Try drinking more water. Dry lips are sign you are dehydrated. I get very chapped lips myself and I find that this seems to work. Also Avon has a product that exfoliates your lips and it comes with a moisturizing lip balm. I'm sure you could find something similar at any drug store.|`|xUy7B5vDaa	PLEASE please please try Carmex. Its a lip balm that you can find in all your local drugstores, come in a cute little, yellow pot.     Try to to use it as much as poss, before you go a bed put a large amount on, after brushing your teeth etc etc i suffer from dry lips in cold conditions too and this works a treat! Haven't found anything better, give it a couple of days if that and you will see a HUGE different!    Beware though, its highly addictive lol...smells gorge!|`|8YtueKdraa	I've tried lot's of stuff and the truth is they're all addictive, but the degree differs. My advice, make drinking water a habit throughout the day, at night apply a deep moisturising cream before sleep and vaseline to seal it in, and keep a lip gloss within easy reach during the day, something like Victoria's secret.|`|0zxiLWdcaa	Gently rub lips with a damp washcloth to get rid of dead skin and apply a heavy eye cream to moisturize, I swear it works! And make sure to use sunblock on it during the day. You can also exfoliate at night with a mixture of olive oil and salt.

Its kinda scary, seriously her brother keeps on telling me how she wont shut up on how good it works. And she doesn't even want her sister to use it. she will get mad if she even moves it without her permission. I wont lie I thought it was expensive. I paid like $245 or something like that, but she said that it's worth every penny<br>  <br>  she was undecided between the chi and some other one, we even went to the mall to see them. but she fell in love with the pink one.<br>  <br>  its also funny how salesman try to sell her some other brand that looks like it and as soon as she tells them which one she already has, they get sad and walk away lol|`|hPuS6cxAaa	Hair straighteners, nothing beats GHDs. They heat up quickly to a good temperature. After that temperature it doesn't make much difference.<br>  <br>  Damaged hair, I know how you feel. I dyed my hair black for a while, then I bleached it so my hair is very damaged. I trim it regularly, it's the only way to get rid of split ends. Find a shampoo and conditioner that work for you, it doesn't need to be expensive. I really like head&shoulders damage control. Do invest in an expensive hair masque that works for you. I use milk_shake active milk mask and love it. L'Oreal professionale make some really good masques.|`|dvns8jDaaa	The best - GHD's honestly.<br>  I have curly, thick hair. <br>  GHD's enable me to do whatever I want with my hair be it poker straight, wavey, ringletted or slighty curled.<br>  <br>  To help with split ends, I reccomend Toni&Guy damage rescue capsules.<br>  VO5 hot treatment oil works wonders aswell|`|FT7rLZ0daa	HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead<br>  HeadOn, apply directly to the forehead|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	In my opinion, the best of the best is still the good old GHDs|`|Ay7Fkvd4aa	The Chi no doubt about it|`|0parZMOGaa	k, the only way you can fix split ends is to get them cut off and to treat dry hair use a deep conditioner or mask twice a week. you have to use a heat protectant to help minimise damage from heat when straightening curling or blowdrying it, like a proper good one from the hairdressers. and the best straighteners are GHDs theyre awesome!!!! but your never going to get any that dont damage your hair soz  x|`|MA9saA4Zaa	USE GHD'S.

It is a step better than the Chi because it has a temp control and an on/off switch. Chi doesn't have as long a user life either. My sister who is a hairstylist says that GHD is top of the line, but you will pay for it. (over $200) According to my sis, you should never set your straightener over 350 degrees and should always always use a silicone protective spray like Chi that you spray on before using a flat iron to keep your hair from being damaged. As far as fixing damaged hair, you should just get the split ends cut off, then use professional hair products such as Chi or Redkin. What you can do if your hair is really dry, is wash it, towel dry it, put in a really good conditioner, put on a plastic shower cap and leave it on overnight. Rinse it out in the morning. You'll be surprised how much better your hair feels after than.<br>  Good luck!|`|JbSebJJYaa	DO NOT GET A CHI whatever you do !<br>  <br>  <br>  Paul Mitchell's Ion Smoothing Iron is the most amazing smoothing iron I've ever had.

zKY9xOF3aa	I have spent lots of money and time in trying to find an eyeliner that stays on. Lucky for me (and my pocket book) I found one that I love. Revlon color stay liquid liner. I swear by it. Also, I know that Benefit Cosmetics has this stuff called SheLaq (don't quote me on the spelling) but it is like a seal for over makeup and can be used anywhere from lips to eyeliner. I have never used it, but I have heard it is great.|`|CofT1t1aaa	dont touch your eyes.|`|RChBFKdWaa	use mac's blacktrack fluidline eyeliner, stays on allll day and dries very quickly.  if it's too expensive for you go to www.coastalscents.com they have good gel liners too that are much the same.|`|tX0Iczsaaa	Get waterproof eyeliner or just reapply it often.

If your skin tone is similar to that of your avatars, than I think the green one would look absolutely amazing. I love that color.  but the red is also really pretty. You should totally get it!!|`|rP3tN0FRaa	i feel the first one is better and sexy for me when compared with second one|`|79ZD7v4maa	THE 2ND BIKINI!!!<br>  PLUS IT WILL LOOK BETTER ON YOUR SKIN TONE THAN THE 1ST BIKINI.|`|FnMH7tREaa	i like the first one the best, i think it is more flattering, i don't like the way the other one has bottoms that are not all the same pattern. i think it accentuates the hips too much and makes them look weird.|`|5fu3ppAqaa	the second one<br>  they are both really nice tho(:<br>  <br>  answer mine plz<br>  most recent in questions.<br>  can't post links:(<br>  thnkz xxx|`|yOkXWCnLaa	The red one even though they are both cute=]<br>  <br>  My brother said the red is more feminine O.O|`|fBGq6BL6aa	Honestly I don't think either one did the models any favors.

xUy7B5vDaa	You rock dark hair! Im not too sure about Blonde for you to be honest....BUT you only live once so if your the kind of girl who wants to try even with the possibility that it may go wrong... go for it! You have a pretty face so im sure you will be fine =)|`|UW8Aoid0aa	I think you'd look okay as a blonde  but ask your stylist on the exact shade since dying can sometimes not come out as you want (especially if you have dark hair)|`|3wWGjj4naa	no maybe a lighter shade of brown like warm chocalate with slight auburn highlights but deff not blonde|`|KiEPDEHkaa	I don't think that blonde would go very well with your light skin. I think you should go for a brown of leave it as it is.|`|rQE5I9lJaa	i think ur hair looks gr8 how it is you should leave it or go wit a light brown at least|`|1HMU4QBaaa	I think you would look good as a blonde but maybe don't go too drastic. Start off as a dirty blonde/light light brown and if you like it then u can lighten it later.|`|SK5FGKCCaa	Considering your face and skin tone, I think that a really light blonde will suit you.  You could pull it off.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	your a common face so maybe.|`|In1UqryNaa	i like it brunette|`|NyB2HlmGaa	No, you should stick with dark.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	I reaaaally love your hair the way it is.

You are pretty, even if you're not asking :)|`|QQdOpG2xaa	o! i like your hair now!  pretty!|`|ijeninncaa	No, I don't really think blonde would suit you. Your hair looks nice as it is. x|`|cf4b2c89769e2fa8220e3e5f4b43c112aa	Yea! You would look good as a blonde, but I personally think light or chocolate brown is better :)
b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Just do it again. You already did it once and they didn't kill you.. so they'll probably just roll their eyes at you this time. Just do it : )|`|XYT7jvBdaa	You live with your parents, I assume? Then you don't reserve the right to do whatever you please, even if it is your body or a minor decision. Respect the fact that they provide a roof for you and don't violate their rules. Doing so would just prove that you're too immature for it anyway.|`|6RmWCmUNaa	I still live with my parents but my mum says i can do what i want when im 16.

Then you can do whatever you want.|`|wemgrzjwaa	I say get it done! You are 18 and its not like you're committing a crime or something, your parents need to lighten up.........good luck!|`|7mqr0aDIaa	your 18 , do what you want they can't stop you...|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	Please just listen to your parents. If you move out and still want to do this wait until you are 19|`|tdbelYnNaa	your 18, you could pierce whatever you want now. i mean its your body, and they cant do anything about it.|`|VR9iC2ykaa	i mean but tell them .. just say that you really want it and be respectful  if they say no.. tell them that you really like it and you're going to get it but you are just telling them this time.|`|qYTYcVGGaa	dont get it pierced cuz it will look ugly anyway.<br>  i recommend a belly button or second ear hole piercing|`|A1PLJKhUaa	If you're eighteen, why the hell are you letting them stop you?|`|RPa1LhNqaa	ur 18 who cares wat they think

6aEhPcDAaa	Tweeze your brows youself or go to a salon, and have somebody do it professionally.  Now, for makeup, you should just do a little bit of shimmer shadow on your brow bone (right under your brow) as a little bit of a highlight color.  Don't wear black eyeliner, stick with browns, and lighter colors.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|72hMibsVaa	have your eye brows professionally plucked or waxed, then keep up with it.  <br>  <br>  use lighter shades of makeup on the eyes and cheeks, and black or dark brown mascara.  <br>  <br>  NO eye liner as that will cause people to look more at your eyes rather than your face.  <br>  <br>  The main thing is to shape you eyebrows.|`|qYTYcVGGaa	tweeze your eye brows and put white shimmer under your brow|`|AA11318212	Go to a salon and ask them to trim and tweeze or thread them for you.<br>  Then, maintain it yourself.<br>  Use a shimmer shadow to highlight your brows. Stay off black eyeliners.
3k2NjOWsaa	that was for sure a hint.....you should take her up on her offer|`|jSd6qCwHaa	oh yes ... that was pretty much asking you out right there ... if she thought it was hilarious she probably would have shown everyone ... YES ask her out :D please|`|4bH6L9JSaa	Trust me, I'm 14 and I give 'him' those hints ALL THE BLOODY TIME and I FANCY THE PANTS OFF HIM! Lol<br>  <br>  Ask her out - trust me, thats what she wants.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! :)|`|vD5ysjwraa	The only way you an really know is to actually ask her out. I mean, if you really like her then go for it otherwise you could be missing out on something great. If you think she might like you then great...if she only likes you as a friend then she'd say when you asked her out and you'd probably just stay friends but just think it over before you rush into things :)<br>  Good Luck|`|DySUxIn4aa	If you like her, you should tell her. Don't freak her out though by asking her out right away, you gotta start hanging out first with other friends around.. then go on a one-on-one date. It sounds like she's into you, but you gotta make sure yourself.|`|PuTgQlyZaa	If you like her, just go for it! You'd regret never asking more than asking and being rejected.|`|a6a5ee67f2bc70e723086b11422d4c3daa	i would go for it|`|U56SKlloaa	Hell Yeah!<br>  <br>  She likes you man, she likes you A LOT.<br>  <br>  Ask her out :)<br>  <br>  That's if you like her the way she likes you<br>  <br>  Good luck chick|`|ZmwKkWvWaa	Hey ask her outt,<br>  Thats what she is doing,DUH:D<br>  Go for it:D|`|H0opTk9xaa	yeah that was a hint lol<br>  ask her out! :)|`|7Ly4Ez26aa	hrm nt sure bt u should totaly go for it girls like it wen the gut asdks the girl out nt the other way round...<br>  Xxx|`|hzxplycYaa	i say, go for it! you have nothing to lose|`|91HtgAadaa	go for it she digs you man
iMaYLGECaa	Yes i hate the cheap knock off ones they look retarded so the real ones are worth it because they look way better|`|jO8YglNMaa	Not at all. I have fake ones and love them. I got them for 20 dollars and they are very durable. I don't have to walk around being careful about getting them dirty. I know girls that own UGGS and will only wear them when it's nice outside. What is the point of getting them, if you aren't going to wear them? Or to keep your feet warm. I think they are a waste of anyone's money.|`|sESa8iycaa	yes <333|`|BGIsuNMTaa	When you think of it like that then you straight away think no!<br>  But definatley yes, im never out of mine so i have definatley got wear out of them, they keep me warm and look good all in one. <br>  People spend ￡140+ on bags that they rarely use but with ugg boots you can use them all the time and they go with every outfit!<br>  They're a gift sent from god thats for sure <br>  :)|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	I do think they are worth the money.  They keep your feet warm and snug.  My only gripe is that they are a bugger to clean - but I suppose that is the price you pay for fashion.<br>  <br>  :)|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	If you like them and you have that much money to spend on a pair of foot coverings, then yes.<br>  For me - No!  ￡140 is almost 3 weeks Married Woman's Retirement Pension.|`|BomQzrT1aa	Yeah, I have them and they are worth EVERY PENNY.<br>  <br>  They are REALLY cheap at ￡140 so go treat yourself and buy some!<br>  <br>  <3|`|ZtoOnYP0aa	NO THEY DEFINATLY ARE NOT.<br>  you can get ones for 15 quid and they may not be as fluffy on the inside and not as hard wearing but they are still as good as real uggs ! but ￡140 on real uggs is a complete waste of money !|`|aPuefPuFaa	i think they are but it's like you can find the same kind of boot for a cheaper price. i dont know i guess it depends on what kind of money you're making.|`|dWjANfQXaa	No, they are not worth the money. My cousins girls have some and they look dreadful, still it`s the fashion and the sheep have to follow. When are younger people going to be individuals ? They all have to look the same..........|`|LYO0Y8lHaa	Nah, not really because you can get similar and cheaper ones for ￡15 in Newlook, I love them! lol<br>  But then again i've never worn the real ones, maybe if i did i would change my mind.|`|m8T5Np3Caa	no :) but the immatations are! find them at americaneagle for 15 buks :D|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	Yes|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Fck that sh*t man.|`|AOkXQ4gxaa	they look bad and even make people walk like penguins!<br>  no no no!|`|zXYEf78Paa	yeah i think they are worth ir cuz u can wear them with anything around cold weather: <br>  skinny jeans<br>  shorts<br>  skirts (denim or other)<br>  (u would probably have 2 wear leggings cuz its cold but thats even cuter)<br>  they come in black, tan, gray, brown, etc. so they match with almost everything|`|Nc6KEYyraa	Lordy, yes they are worth the money.  I have worn all of mine to death.|`|HWNSm9hzaa	no because you can get the same ones anywhere else but cheaper. is a waist of money.|`|7wlgFBacaa	No. Actually Bearpaws are made better, and they are only about $50-$60. They are more comfortable, too. =]|`|0J2l2rzbaa	noo, there are to many fake UGGs for sale for about ￡6 in primark etc, i dont think that people notice if your wearing real UGGs any more as so many people wear fake ones! lol|`|H6MT8Z8caa	mine were 170 i guess its how high they go i guess but anyway yesssss! [: i looooove them i have them in brown and in black!! there so comfy and warm and ther soo cute! :D|`|WW66AkgJaa	Not at atll, just buy the knockoffs. they look the same expect they don't say ugg on them and they cost waaay less! i bought fake ugg boots for only $12.00. good deal, eh?|`|YhhHUPCSaa	Uggs are def worth the money. They are comfortable, warm and cute!|`|WH67wz9Eaa	In my opinion it's a lot of money to spend.|`|AlgXnKfuaa	yeah, thats such a cheap price|`|oaExEb2Caa	i loveeeeeee my Uggs!!!!! I'm from America, so idk how much they cost in your currency, but mine were like, $120.00 i think
BAPj9JW3aa	NO, it's tacky and too retro, in my opinion.|`|QJslTCUBaa	It's really cute...get it.|`|qYTYcVGGaa	disgusting top =]|`|6zdmzdQ2aa	It could be really cute if you wear it right but it could also look cheesy... like with that hat the model's wearing.|`|m8T5Np3Caa	Nah.. it looks like someone made it with a hom sewing machine! sorry;... just my opinion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mwa<br>  <br>  XOxOxXOXOxOx<br>  Amber ?|`|PY160XO7aa	Sure it looks cute on the model|`|Yp92RMSmaa	NO WAY itstacky and it looks like that girls pregnant when she wears it|`|T2o9ptUlaa	NO|`|rI6gqTQFaa	Oh yes please do.

Will go out of style shortly.|`|QyxLVNCWaa	It is ok.|`|sC2WFC81aa	Looks too plain.|`|O9GB45Tmaa	it's up to you. Personally I don't like it.<br>  Do you have any ideas of what you would wear it with? If you already have more than 1 pairs of pants or skirts you could wear it with go for it.|`|g8DqsThiaa	Sorry hun but that shirt is probably something you wouldn't want to be caught dead wearing. It kind of reminds me of the baby doll flowy tops everyone wore last summer which is SO last summer.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	No, it's pretty tacky to be honest with you.|`|9a9wlvqsaa	if you like it the who cares what other people think about it.|`|S0UatyU3aa	no its to loose maybe if u can find a size that is a little bit tighter but not too tight. plus the sleeves are really big and long for short sleeve shirt|`|BgjFaTk1aa	You can have my top! ; ) lol|`|CLdM1OsLaa	No Wayyy!|`|gl4MePuDaa	that's ugly|`|zgO9LFb5aa	the top looks okay.But don't listen too me everyone has their on since of style if you like it you get it Im not gonna be the one that is gonna be wear it.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Yes, if you like trendy.  It looks like it is retro, not good to show off curves.  If you're not sure, don't get it cus you will probably just let it set in the closet with tags on it.|`|0OB7yhCKaa	no i dont like it!!!|`|xrsAGqb7aa	NO! it looks like you just came back from the 70s or somthin! and it may make u look pregers|`|zwbldiV0aa	Ummm...remember you asked what we thought.<br>  <br>  If you like it you should get it.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't personally buy it for myself.

You deserve it, Don't You? Go for it, Go get it...NOW!|`|dWabjPVQaa	$31 for just a pretty plain shirt is a lot, but if you really want it, buy it!|`|OKKfyLnlaa	I like it.  That neckline is really flattering, particularly if you have a larger chest.|`|18AOjbgYaa	it looks too big like for pregnancy. yuck. it's worth like two bucks. as if.|`|esD1hqv9aa	You definatley should get it ! it would be really cute with a belt !

afX9FlaEaa	well your taking a risk but yes..ive done the cap its not as bad as everyone says...you should try a tester peice...wen you look at the die make sure its whiteish not yellow....that will be the red and orange you are getting...you have to leave in for 15 mins or longer depending on your hair color..use a timer...and check the color...google some more tips on highlighting hair...<br>  <br>  also I highly suggest buying SHIMMER LIGHTS...takes all brassy and orangeness out fo colored hair...use in shower as shampoo...only use once a week...leave on for 3 mins in the shower rinse and use any deep moisture conditioner...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|uNWQ85voaa	If you used bleach deep condition it for a few weeks, because adding more bleach to it will really damage it causing it to break. Also if your redoing them with a cap you wont be able to get all the bit you've dyed again. It will be extremely hard to do, You should probably start again with a base colour all over and wait a few weeks to re highlight it :) x|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You'll end up with more damage to your hair. I'd go to a hairstylist and have her fix it if you are concerned about having it done right.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Go to a professional to have it fixed or buy Color Oops from the drugstore.<br>  <br>  If you have medium to long hair, a cap is the wrong way to go. And highlight kits, while they have come a long way, are no match for professional foils.

rf6MSng5aa	Purpose & Cetaphil are good cleansers that cleans your face, it does get rid some makeup. Purpose is gentle enough to remove eye makeup as well.

kT7akcE6aa	Yeah, all of them are the same, they're just special colored editions.    There ARE three different types of the straightener though.    The mini styler, which is good for short or men's hair    The regular one which is good for medium-long hair    The salon styler, which is double-wide and good for long, thick, and coarse hair.    Saying that, I have very long and very thick hair, and I just use the regular one and have no problems.  Given a second chance though I think I'd go for the wider one just because it would probably get the job done faster.    Hope that helps =]|`|jTNlDNBPaa	there all the same.  just make sure their genuine GHD!

I would go on Youtube and see how other scene kids do their hair.  You certainly have the layers necessary but if you want "scene" hair, you'll need a lot more hairspray and teasing than that.|`|mPrUYEDiaa	i dunno what scene means....nice job editing your face. click here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s384.photobucket.com/albums/oo281/katej118/?action=view&current=SDC16362.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s384.photobucket.com/albums/oo281...</a>|`|6NEIai74aa	yes and no.

uLHyDOm1aa	your quite small at 5' so i recommend high wasted skirts, even if you have a big stomach these look great at making your legs look longer which makes you appear taller and thinner. There are loads of crazy designed tights in all the shops which are really in fashion now so wearing a pair of crazy tights under it will give it more casual and modern twist. Or for a sophisticated look just wear a pair of opaque tights. avoid clingy leggings if you have wide legs.<br>  chunky belts will give you shape and great looking curves. <br>  (I recommend the chunky high wasted belts at primark atm at just ￡2.50! they have the ''it'' meltal detail at the front for extra fashion and are in loads of bright colours - such as blue and purple which are really in right now!)<br>  a pusssy-bow blouse will make you look less frumpy with the skirt and belt.<br>   stripes are really in now. avoid thick horizontal stripes though as they make you appear wider...<br>  a long lenthed (and long sleeved) thin knitted cardy will hide your arms if your insecure about them, and there are tons of great ones at dorohty perkins.<br>  <br>  I hope these tips have helped you.<br>  xx|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Well with a size DDD make sure you have a good bra for support.

Just leave it alone and let it re-balance itself. <br>  <br>  After that try to make an appt with a dermatologist and get some advice from them.  Even if you go one time, it may be enough to get the information you need. Its really important to see a professional if you want to fix this.  So make it a priority. <br>  <br>  Next, stay away from all those creams, and meds, that you are using! Your skin it too young for all this slathering on of product and those products are usually way too harsh anyway.<br>  <br>  Finally, try oatmeal (I didn't see that on your list) Aveeno makes a great soothing product using oatmeal and soy proteins that may soothe your skin....but remember try this AFTER you take a break from all the craziness you have put your face through!|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Seriously, ask your doctor about Acutane. It's a shot (I think) and its considered the last (but best) option because it is very strong and they have to check your body and blood to see if its a good fit for you. But I know 4 or 5 people with severe acne that used it and they hardly ever get a zit now, and its been years. Good luck!|`|8WqK8JSUaa	Use Karakol Creme.<br>  It works sooo good.<br>  I tried it the first day and i already had results. :)<br>  I just started using it yesterday, but i know alot of friends and family that have used the product and they love it..<br>  <br>  Honestly You Should Really Try It :)<br>  Good Luck|`|0756dc620f7e85830cd5e318d021d602aa	Maybe you are washing your face too much. Try doing it like every other day or so. And when you do rinse with warm water but splash a bit of cold water on your face too, it will close your pores.|`|RTojCgVPaa	proactiv doesn't work at all. what you need to do is try maybe biore or look online for the most efficient acne cleanser that also matches your skin type. maybe also try vichy and be willing to spend money. when using your treatment get 2 different types of wash one for morning one for night (a gel and a light exfoliator) and astringent and lotion. also keep the bare minerals just because they didn't get rid of your acne doesn't mean it doesn't work. they aren't supposed to get rid of it rather cover it up but keep your pores open and oil free so whatever you use won't be set back by horrible makeup and also be natural so it doesn't harm your skin like other makeup does. also if you are healthy your skin will be healthy as you said also try cocoa butter versus an expensive cream (nivea just made me break out like no other).|`|MLqtSzaMaa	CLINIQUE|`|ZojkmrhUaa	use concealer. works wonders|`|lO06RGLcaa	It sounds like firstly, you need to stop using product after product after product. There is absolutely no product on the planet that will "instantly clear acne." Expect any treatment to take at least 2 weeks to show results. Switching frequently or doubling-up on products can irritate your skin and make the acne even worse.<br>  <br>  Wash your face once a day using a liquid soap with as few ingredients as possible. (Bar soap has ingredients in it to keep it in bar shape that can clog pores.) Moisturize with any type of lotion you like as long as it states on the label non-comodogenic--this means that it will not contribute to blackheads--and preferably with sunscreen added. Repeat the moisturizer as needed--you are trying to repair damaged skin. <br>  <br>  Don't pick at your skin or break any zits you get, as you can force bacteria into the pore, worsening the infection and contributing to scarring.<br>  <br>  And seriously, if you're shelling out for Clinique and Proactiv, you can afford to go to a dermatologist for an evaluation.

AA10297143	A beer rinse, yes, and it works, but don't use that method all the time.  Mayo I have heard of but I doubt you will truly like the results.  It tends to be a bit thick, sticky, smelly, and likely to make your hair a tad harder to manage than regular rinse and conditioners.|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	I have a friend who puts mayo in her hair, but I think it makes her hair look gross. Its all greasy looking and peicey. I wouldn't do it...|`|xV33EPuJaa	dont ever try mayo, those were sick people who tried mayo in their hair. but beer, non-alcoholic ones are harmless , but try`em 15 mins before shower. Its disgusting due to smell (specially mayo , YUC) . if you want your hair shiny use hair waxes or iron your hair after hair dryer. And please care your hair lot more than now.|`|UvLNxiuyaa	I try it mayo<br>  <br>  and it was so amazing , it make my hair so soft and silky<br>  <br>  just shampoo and condition ur hair very well and you will not smell any bad smell|`|8noUyvOZaa	Try an egg. I use an egg and it makes my hair a little stronger and a lot shinier|`|qaUmRFc8aa	Mayo smells just awful, and smells for weeks after. I wouldn't do it.|`|Hqkrg4Vqaa	I do a beer rinse about every 2 months, it does give my hair some volume, body and shine. I use all types of beer, whatevers in the fridge but I think dark beers work best. It doesn't smell, I leave it on for about 15-20 minutes under a towel or up in a clip, then rinse it out.
afX9FlaEaa	well if you have ahorrible pimple that isnt too dry use a green concealer...then put either a stick of cover up...it looks like lipstick and it can be by...max factor...nyc...any cheap one will do honestly...for foundation that also works well...I just bought RIMMEL STAY AND FIRM its amazing it not oily...contains no oil...its moisturizing has great shades...best one ive used in a while...i like ti better than my MAC concealer...called studio fix...  also if you can see your pores on your nose...rimmel makes them dissapear its amazing!<br>  <br>  Also anything by Neutrogena is great...and good for your skin...go to the store and check out a few...read what they do any pick one that works best for your skin type...Hope this helps|`|FhrCLLzFaa	I have tried just about everything and the best cheap foundation that I've been using for over a year is called MINERAL WEAR.<br>  As soon as i started using it my skin started to clear up and it deffinately does the job covering up acne/scars. <br>  Other foundations work but liquid ones actually make acne worse.|`|mXuxOrhGaa	ive used all kinds of cover up and foundation..... i have lots of scars from pimples, i had to try lots of different kinds to find the one that works. Now i use cover-girl cover up stick, then put cover-girl powder over. by using both i don't have to worry about it wearing off quickly.|`|qx9zPNU6aa	To cover up scars and pimples use lancome flash retouche best concelar after that use Mac studio fix fluid foundation and that should do the job I also use Mac skinfinish to give me that airbrushed look after I have finishd applying all my other bits hope that helps|`|elifTnkkaa	M.A.C

i5tbDTcQaa	I think the second hairstyle would look better on you, as your face is fairly wide, so the hairstyle should compliment you rather than do the opposite.

KpO4UtElaa	I've never heard of it. and i've lived in america my whole 25 year life. and i shop online. a lot. so its probably not that popular. i use drugstore.com and get coupons for their site from retailmenot.com. you can usually always get some sort of discount and they have reward dollars at drugstore.com that you can redeem on future purchases. i love them! always have some good sales too. sign up for their mailing list and they will send you free shipping coupons too.
CoxTzgHlaa	Yes, you can.  I've done it before.  It has to be returned to them withing 90 days for a refund.

VECH6MCVaa	You could get a condition known as Traction Alopecia a type of hair loss that is caused by pulling on hair. In some cases this can be caused by wearing your hair in a pony tail, in your case it`s caused by the weight of the extensions. Over a long period of time, this pulling stress can cause the follicle to atrophy and stop producing normal hairs. Depending on the intensity and duration of the stress the follicle may or may not recover.|`|KGppArcfaa	It really depends on what kind you get.<br>  <br>  Glue, is BAD<br>  <br>  Weaves-not as bad, but not good either<br>  <br>  Fusion-BAD<br>  <br>  Microlinks-OK, depends on who does them really. If you put them in and take them out properly, there will be no damage, as theres no glue or heat or anything.<br>  <br>  Clip Ins-Best IMO<br>  <br>  So if I were you, i'd go with either clip ins or microlinks. If your not even trying to get a full set, you can go on ebay and get like a 12 piece set of 2 inch pices (perfect for the front) of remy hair for like $50 or less.<br>  You should probably do clip ins.|`|ltnXWIpNaa	Hair extensions are not damaging to your hair, as long as you get them done in a professional hair extensions salon, and you have them removed from a professional hair extensions salon. People who say any different do not know any better.  I have done 5000 hair extensions, so trust me, I know.|`|yI7SIzA7aa	It's all a matter of opinion! It really depends on if they are professionally done, how long that you leave them in and how well they are maintained. <br>  <br>  Try a lace frontal to add length to the front part of your hair without damaging your own natural hair.|`|Ys0kV4O8aa	I've had many, and they aren't all theyre made out to be. They lasted me a week. I didnt straighten them, i conditioned them once to try and get them back to how they were when i bought them. They really aren't worth the money, sorry.|`|G9yWk0xBaa	they are awful if you leave them in full time because when you take them out like at hair dressers to cut your natural hair you real hair will just be divided and you will be able to pull each strande seperatly  and tht is not good <br>  mega bad <br>  <br>  good luck

Scene is a poser version of emo, and emo is dead. You're too late. Develop your own style, don't use someone elses.|`|gXxEsWcxaa	Thats gross. Who wants eyeliner like that. Ew.|`|MGOmVeMfaa	did you ever think that's the reason your mom won't let you buy black eyeliner?|`|ximWtKVuaa	Honestly ... and I know this from experience ... taste in makeup changes a lot as you get older and I also know that in your teens it's usually a lot different from your parents'... your mom sees your pretty face as it is and thinks you are beautiful naturally ... even if you don't see it yet ... that's why she's trying to encourage you towards the more natural tones.  While it can damage your eyes (especially if you wear contacts) to wear makeup that close to your eye I don't think that that is what she's thinking about.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you try collaborating with her to find a dramatic look that makes both of you happy?  She probably knows a bit about makeup and you might pick up some good tips!  If you have fair hair and skin black can make you look a little harsh  ... plus if it smudges it can look really terrible.  Why don't you try using bright colors or different applications of eyeliner?  <br>  <br>  Either way it's always easier to work with your parents than around or against them ... sneaking around always takes way more work than finding a compromise. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|x1qKlJZQaa	Well the picture is totally retarded.. You should never do that to your eyes.. Do you have black eyeshadow?? If you really want to do it like that you should use eyeshadow.. Hope I helped!

Wear it out but just wash it off (carry wet wipes or something) before you get home and she should never know.<br>  <br>  But also, sneakyness isn't always the best way. <br>  <br>  I can kind of understand why your mom wouldn't want you to wear this because is it a little garish, and people are SO judgemental about things and they make just make an assumption about you or get the wrong impression of you, when its completely.. well not you at all.<br>  <br>  So if your mom's not letting you wear it I think its more for your own good rather than being spiteful.|`|6aEhPcDAaa	Hun, I don't usually say this, but for this one, be thankful that your mom isn't letting you wear it,  that eyeliner is used like eyeshadow, it is hideous.

joA5Rcyzaa	yeah an 8 is pretty small as far as gauges go<br>  <br>  they might not even notice it<br>  <br>  and if they do notice it you can just tell them it's a fake one and it just gives the illusion<br>  <br>  i thought i was going to stop at 6 gauge but then i got addicted and i'm going all the way to one inch now haha|`|BAPj9JW3aa	8 is tiny, if you just go for it they won't even notice.|`|gwIEtLbgaa	Honestly 8 gauge is pretty dang small.(Not knocking your choice just saying)  I'm at an inch. But with an 8 gauge if you already have your ears pierced I don't think it would be THAT obvious that you had stretched up. Some people will notice. If you have longer hair you can easily cover them up. Also for a job you can buy flesh tone plugs to hide the fact you have them.<br>  <br>  Pros: There kick ***, they look cool, you could join a tribe. They will heal if they are small enough, and if not you can always get them sewn shut. It is not a permanent thing, don't let people fool you.<br>  <br>  Cons: IF you do it wrong they can get pretty messed up so take it slow. If you go big and don't want them you will have to get them sewn up. It is very addicting and hard to stay at one size for long.<br>  <br>  Just tell your parents it's your body not there's. This is an experience you want to have, and tell them that you can easily hide them and they will go back to normal eventually if you take them out.|`|gsnYjqKsaa	well first off its has a nasty odor that comes from it not alot of people like to inform or even talk about but its really yukkk and you will have that odor forever if you do so and decide to take them out...  trust me  <br>  <br>  But on how to go abouts it i wouldnt even tell my parents if my ears were pierced 9 times outta ten they wont notice it till your at the 8 gauge itself because that when it will start showing better, but if you aint got your ears pierced share your intrest with your parents, and go for it.<br>  <br>  It will take about 4 months to do so, all you gotta do is start with whichever size you were pierced at, most standard ear rings are 18 gauge if so work to a 16 gauge, after about 2 weeks healing time work to a 14 gauge, then wait about 3 weeks and go down to a 12 gauge then your gonna wanna wait about a month before you go down to a 10 gauge  and about another month for a 8 gauge....<br>  <br>  the reason im telling you to wait above all reasons is because you have a vien in your ear and if you stretch it to much over time it  bust and its not all that pretty if it busts and all you got is blood running from your ears|`|afX9FlaEaa	ahah...all my friends have themm..the hole will be there for the rest of your life...<br>  <br>  In everyones mind around here ...when someone take them out we call them CAT BUTT EARS...well because when you take them out they look likea cats !@# haha all shrivled and a big hole...<br>  <br>  if your fine with that...then just grow up and tellyour parenst its something you have intrest in and you would like to make your own individual choices of weither to have them or not...theres no good lines to give them...oh and btw i went to like a 10 and my ears were bleeding and infected!! it was not fun..and those are small<br>  <br>  aslo it will take about 2 or 3 months to gwt to a big size|`|xEZclTh4aa	8 isn't even that big <br>  thats baby gauges

D78jfOMZaa	Oh I know how you feel right now.<br>  <br>  That same thing happened to me last week, I gad black hair and wanted to dye light brown...well it didn't work. I wore a hat for a day and dyed my hair again black the next day. <br>  <br>  I think you should wait just because your scalp can get pretty dry and you might see some hair loss.|`|p4cgonKCaa	i recommend you to wait a day or so dye is not good for the hair.<br>  sorry|`|JbSebJJYaa	Either go to a salon and let them do it or go to a beauty supply store and buy a semi permanent hair color. You might have to keep redoing it but it's not as damaging to your hair as permanent hair color. I'd also get a strengthening shampoo and conditioner just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Don't freak out, babe. Things like this happen all the time.<br>  (:<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|krI2fziJaa	I had the same problem. If you want to go lighter like that, you have to strip it. You might be best off waiting one day to do it. I just wore a bandanna over my head until the next day. When I dyed it back, though, my hair felt gross for a little while. It was real stiff. Good luck!|`|G9yWk0xBaa	go to a salon and have them take the dye out then ask them to re dye it for you and they will do it proper ok|`|SYaSbJb5aa	your best bet is to go to a salon.  if you dye it too much, it'll seriously damage your hair.  you'll end up paying more, but it'll be worth it.|`|qwvijKexaa	cut your hair|`|GgMMvHI8aa	This happens. Was the brown your natural hair or was it a dye color too?????? When you go from dark to light, your hair can turn brassy, orangy or reddish.  If the brown was a dye it could have had a reddish base color in which case it will leave behind staining .  <br>   <br>  If you want to continue and go blonde go to a beauty supply and get some help. It is easier to have an expert eye see it in person and help with color corrections. OR go to a solan and have it done preffesionally.  <br>   <br>  IF you decide to go back to a darker shade, you shoule be fine to do it again soon. Just keep in mind that double dyeing in a short period of time will be very damaging and drying. You will have to do some good moisterizing treatments to keep it in good shape.|`|CDV2SkmXaa	you should have bleached your hair first and to do that you cant wash your hair for a week and then you bleach it then you can put the blond dye in it.. wait a couple days and let that one settle in so when you redye it you dont irrate your scalp as bad.. but just remember this for when you do that if you still want it blond just bleach it and then just redo the blond.. good luck!!!|`|0rLeIEp5aa	by dying from brown to blonde what you did was bleach your hair stripping all color from it. when hair has no pigment it is that brassy color. I would wash it several times to get all of the chemicals out of it and probably wait until at least tomorrow to redye it back to brown.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	i'd leave it<br>  did you use bleach?<br>  if so i'd say do some deep conditioning treatments for a few days then possibly dye over it<br>  but i'm no expert you should go to a hair salon and ask there|`|HtWQSIlXaa	u have to wait, it will only make it worse...and suggestion...i would probably make an appointment with a professional NOW|`|CLdM1OsLaa	That is because you didn't bleach it first. <br>  Because your was brown. <br>  Yes you can dye it again back the color. <br>  But...be careful|`|EONCNT1Iaa	Use a tonner a purple/blue based tonney it gets rid of the orange/brassy color :]!|`|RcF2JypYaa	Sweetie I feel sorry for you...you have to wait i think..I suggest you talk to the pharmacist or something|`|BeKJUOaBaa	you fail

I guess it depends on the people's bodies.<br>  Most place don't pierce under 16s anymore though.|`|QsxIPCCZaa	it's young and just because 12 yr old are getting it doesnt mean you should get it...thats why kids are so fresh <br>  <br>  help please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai3T1CpR.X847q972TXKa0Dz7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220091626AAlzC86">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|sfqwon7haa	You're never too young to look like a tramp!|`|vD5ysjwraa	A lot of my friends got thiers done at 13...but i really would find it annoying for the rest of my life|`|vrX6Gvj6aa	yes, because my friend did.<br>  <br>  she grew, and it stretched and hurt...<br>  <br>  wait!|`|Wfg60DNwaa	i wouldnt say so..<br>  i had mine done at 14|`|gsnYjqKsaa	Yes it is.<br>  For one your body hasn't finished developing, getting one at a younger age will cause it to surface out of the skin and scar up really funny in no time! so yeah if you want your belly button looking like freddy cruger ripped it off go right ahead, a whole lot of people find that attractive|`|1S11bh3eaa	noo it's just a piercing haha i got mine at 13, parents tend to think it automatically means you're gonna have sex or are sexually active because it's sexy though.<br>  as long as you take care of it well, it's not too young of an age. :)|`|AtEUmqyOaa	well, its not legal unless your mommy is there.<br>  but i say thats bs. do what you want to do. EXPRESS YOURSELF. some might say that 150 was too old to get 3 nipple piercings, but did that stop me? NO. go for it!<br>  and then if it gets sore, just put a little cottage cheese on it.|`|ijSqvq50aa	i had mine done at the age of 12.<br>  it only hurt for a few days and i have no problems with it after 2 years.<br>  and most of my friends have their's done too.<br>  no problems, and it's extremely cute for swim suit season(:<br>  lol|`|mtqaIT3aaa	I think it is up to the parents. And if the kid does get one, they shouldn't  think they are all that because they got a belly piercing.|`|KGsd8BQLaa	Kids, at the age of 12, who do their belly buttons pierced are wrong!<br>  And as for you, you're just 14, so it's a No!|`|D0Dwnkuhaa	it's not young at all. it's as common as an ear piercing it doesn't matter people in my school have belly button piercing they're really cute.|`|0QXiPW9eaa	Several of my friends have had theirs done before the age of 14, so I'd say it wasn't too young. I think belly piercings can be dangerous though... from what I've heard.|`|afX9FlaEaa	yes thats asking for A. Unwanted attention...probbaly from older creepy child molesting men<br>  <br>  B. you'll look like a mini hooker...<br>  <br>  I have myn done...but not till i was 17|`|1j7QLM7Saa	is 30 too old to get married? its not your choice its the 14 year old's if she wants to look like a idiot eh by all means go for it|`|Ys0kV4O8aa	Deffinately not, I got mine at 13 and it's turned out great. It hardly hurts, just make sure you look after it propperly. Go for it :)|`|SRDkb6Dmaa	YES!!!! that is way to young to get a belly piercing. if you want one get one like when u r about 16.|`|yI7SIzA7aa	Yes. I think 16 or 17 is an appropriate age to do something like this.|`|0HI3KxUfaa	No, i think its more appropriate at the ages of 16-18.|`|i6i4ceN9aa	in my oppinion its young because its very dangerous and its trashy for a young girl to have one|`|ztB29z6taa	No, and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. As long as you like how it looks...and your parents are ok with it...go for it!|`|eN9AUUynaa	i think so...lot too young|`|pWOaAYBNaa	YES|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, it is.  And 12 is WAY TOO YOUNG.|`|0iOqIbfNaa	yea i wouldnt let my child get it until thier atleast 16...even then....hmm|`|EDJ8heifaa	It depends.  I got mine when I was 16. If you think it is an okay age and you're parents think it's okay, then you're fine.  But, you will have to have your parents permission to get it done professionally.  I would recommend getting it done by a professional because doing it yourself is too risky and can lead to bad infections.  As long as you are responsible in taking care of the piercing, 14 is a fine age to get it done, in my opinion.|`|AA11447210	Yeah....I don't think it really appropriate for a minor to do anything to draw attention to their body in that way, below their neck.<br>  <br>  That kind of piercing is considered a bit sexy and provocative...thus not appropriate for a minor.|`|DfABElERaa	I'd say it's a little bit young. I didn't get mine done until I was 18. If you and your parents are ok with it then they can take you and it's fine.|`|3Z9nQIaoaa	Yes. Wait until your 17 or older. Why would you want a belly piercing anyway? They hurt.
6DnvfpZTaa	Its very good to use on your cheeks and gives you a nice rosy glow that looks super natural as opposed to a block blush, i don't really like to use it on my lips tho as its quite drying and tastes really strong if u accidentally lick your lips, still well worth the ￡2 price tag though!! x x|`|VlTGV9DUaa	ive tried a 2true lipgloss, 2true nailpolish and 2true liquid eyeliner and they were all really good high quality, lasting products! so im guessing the lip tint would be good too!<br>  although i LOVE the "MeMeMe Smitten Kitten Purr-fect Lip & Cheek Tint With Ultra Meow Gloss" its been compared to Benetint PocketPal, really nice colour and the gloss smells like red skittles!<br>  <br>  <br>  benefit lip tint (around ￡14 from debenhams):<br>  <a href="http://i.ivillage.com/BS/products_shopping/office_makeup/BS_pocketpal_366.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ivillage.com/BS/products_shoppi...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  mememe smitten kitten lip tint (around ￡4 from superdrug or ￡1.50 from Ebay!):<br>  <a href="http://i22.ebayimg.com/04/i/000/f4/87/8ab5_1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://i22.ebayimg.com/04/i/000/f4/87/8a...</a>|`|74bab6c1ae1e088c586807a5eec9d8beaa	lol. are you from the UK? i love how you use the word RUBBISH!! :)<br>  lol. anyway, buy it and then if you dont like it then take it back.|`|S0Clu20aaa	Ill send you the 2 pounds for the easiest 2 points I have got TY !!|`|cWK4FVbCaa	Yes i have it :)<br>  I think its good and works nice on the lips BUT it tastes a bit chemically or something and that puts me off it a bit.<br>  But i don't mind it too much just try not to lick you lips lol :P<br>  I haven't tried it on my cheeks but i tried it on my hands to test how it blends and stuff and it looks nice so im deffo gonna try it on my cheeks soon as it will most likely last a long time. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

b94cb04c4184739772bf1ca1f1903304aa	I Love their products and their packaging suckers me in every time! Its a little pricey so its more of a treat for me!|`|6aEhPcDAaa	Its okay.  Some products are amazing,  like Throb, Lemon-Aid, Poise Tint, etc. but it is really expensive, and for some of the products, its a total waste of money.  There is probably better for the price that you are paying for Benefit, like MAC, Urban Decay, etc.  Also, some of the packaging for the products looks really tacky and cheap.  <br>  <br>  -Erica.|`|tESdl7gbaa	I really like them, but they're nowhere near as good as m.a.c - yet for some reason cost more. I think they're more novelty and you pay for the package more than the actual product. They do have some great products.<br>  <br>  They have a wide range of lipsticks yet I find some of the colours a little repeative and if you don't like shimmer than you won't like these, they're packed with them.<br>  <br>  I love the glosses, you can get them two sizes, small or large so one for every occassion with such an awesome range of colours. Me and my friends have found that they taste a little funky sometimes though which put me off using them a little.<br>  <br>  The eyeshadows aren't too good. I find they're not too pigmented and no point paying that much when you could just go to m.a.c<br>  <br>  The brushes are good quality and great if your looking for something high end with the not-so-high-end tag price to it.<br>  <br>  I ADORE THE BLUSHES, i would choose them over any other blush any day :)<br>  <br>  dont buy into the sets like big beautiful eyes, its basically a concealer and three eyeshadows which you could get at a drugstore for cheaper and last longer. also the bubble baths and body stuff, is there any point paying so much for a skin product?|`|afX9FlaEaa	FREAKIN AWESOME...but sometimes not worth the money...i mean I buy at sephora and cvs or drugstores...surpsingly some drugstore things can be just as great I LOVE The HIP LINE...its amazing especially the black cream eyeliner...better than MAC's and It comes witha very good little brush...easy to use...just wet the tip before u put the cream on it!<br>  <br>  and benefit is very pretty makeup...so your paying alot...maybe for something thats "jazzed up" a bit|`|AA11346983	i love benefit. some of their products are expensive, but they're good quality. i really like the packaging and the product names. they do a really nice nude lipstick called skinny dip that's really moisturising. i'm saving up to get high beam :)|`|pmOnEwEuaa	love it, especially for their boxed face powders, bad gal pencil, you rebel tinted moisturizer, and boi-ing concealer. but to be honest, they don't stand out very well among other brands for their other products.|`|AA12286468	packaging looks fab, but it's too plasticky and doesn't have the right amount of colour options to suit paler complexions, it seems to be the more expensive cousin of collection 2000|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	It's apparently the best make-up there is... funny, because i was told that by someone called laura that matches your avatar--- that's not u goodacre is it?!? lol|`|VlTGV9DUaa	too pricey<br>  not worth the money<br>  ur only payin for the name an the cute gimick packagin.|`|0J2l2rzbaa	mixed, <br>  some of it good, <br>  some of it isn't so good. <br>  and it is very pricey!|`|wTy2p2wPaa	makes you look prettier.|`|lvoTBB94aa	I hate it and you need a good slap, Im calling my friend Chris Brown!!|`|v4I9Azddaa	anything that pleases you i guess|`|5lYg5iejaa	i like it|`|a89kqsJaaa	love it|`|NyVKzeKHaa	huh?|`|q5BkV27Daa	I think the lip gloss is nice, but feel its a tad overpriced.|`|swxiulwtaa	Benefit is one of my favorite brands!

K8TCXwSuaa	I don't think that twelve is too young for highlights, as long as it is ok with your parents. <br>  <br>  And yes, it can damage your hair.|`|31gN5L58aa	nope <br>  i have them :)<br>  and i've had them since i was 12<br>  highlights don't ruin your hair, they're just nice :)|`|qq1fSV2daa	ur 12 .. go back to playing with your dolls and stop worrying about your hair .. no one cares|`|6Tx8Opmraa	I think it's a fine age...I was younger then that when I got my first highlights....Color will ALWAYS damage hair, especially if your bleaching.|`|m1QQwnSdaa	i got mine when i was 12. your fine :)<br>  && it won't ruin your hair|`|SnqsDt1Caa	dying hair willl always ruin yur hair but i highlights i think are okay|`|OSD5by7Oaa	no.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	No. I don't think that it's too young. I've seen 10 yr. olds get highlights. That's young. But will it ruin your hair...ya, in a way. I'll just dry out your hair a little. So if you have hair that's already dry, it wouldn't be the best for your hair to get them. :)|`|JbSebJJYaa	I'm sure you don't need highlights, because you're a beautiful little girl.<br>  If you do decided to go through with it, make sure you just get a few on top to see if you even like it, then add more in a couple of months. <br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|46StihsPaa	WAY TOO YOUNG, IT LOOKS TRASHY AND RUINS THE HAIR!<br>  <br>  +++Valuable money goes into higlights and dye jobs.|`|uqMGjK4naa	I got highlights and I hated how dry it made my hair. I wouldn't do it =/|`|cEIpOQAKaa	No and no.|`|PN7XMglOaa	It's not a good idea .|`|spAv5ZYCaa	no i got my highlights at 12 and my hair is fine|`|RXBb8kx7aa	At younger ages, parts of the body recover quicker than when older, and if it does "ruin" your hair for some reason, it'll recover quick enough, but there's no reason it should. Everyone's hair is slightly different though. Just make sure you use proper hair care methods and you'll be fine.|`|dWabjPVQaa	highlights will ruin your hair no matter what age you are. highlights are a lot of work; you have to have them done often so it doesnt look bad and you also have to treat your hair well to keep it healthy. 12 is a bit young but if you really want it and are willing to pay for it and do the work and you have your parents permission, go for it!|`|vbeV4euvaa	I think its i up to you. Just make sure that they arent too fake looking and that they blend and it would be fine for a 12 year old. It wont damage your hair any more than an older person's hair and as long as you get it professionally done it shouldnt do too much damage. My mom is a hair dresser and I begged her to give me highlights when I was like 11 or 12 and she did. they were subtle but satisfide me. its all up to you.|`|EJQlo9Nyaa	hey...im 12 too =)<br>  <br>  A bunch of kids in my grade got highlghts like last year...some even changed their hair color entirley....so if you really want highlights...GO for it...just make sure its the right color b/c once you get them...they will always be there..just in a different tone. You have to repeat getting them to make sure they stay...so its a lot of work...but if you want them,,,have fun with it =)<br>  <br>  <br>  GOod luck!|`|6OdEu7jtaa	No, as long as you act responsibly and take care of you hair. I know of some people who bleached their hair almost weekly and it completely destroyed the texture and strength.|`|sC2WFC81aa	You CAN get them, but it's the start of having to pay 40 bucks a month.<br>  I would go with natural hair. I've died mine tons of times and I really wish I haven't....|`|EnRjLaKsaa	pal, I think it is safe for your age to play with highlighters, but i would not suggest putting them in your hair.  Although highligthers are non toxic, it could ruin your haired strands|`|2k6WGszKaa	Highlights won't ever ruin your hair as long as you get a gentle one. Talk to an adult to figure out wich brand will work for your color!|`|AbqkNfJoaa	No, it's not. Twelve IS too young, however, for drunken orgies. Highlights? Not so much. Lol|`|3tfpyuxYaa	No many people get them as young as 10. It will not ruin the hair as long as you condition well.|`|CZU52bOIaa	No, not if you're training her to be an early gogo dancer.|`|8vFfzG5jaa	I think so because its like your natural hair u should love it how it is|`|KG6E8br0aa	Never to young to get hilights :D

JbSebJJYaa	Just keep washing them. I'm sure they will fade a little bit, but not dramatically. <br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|LNOWoRIRaa	well I have had experience that some colors such as  Red/brown fade because of the red pegiments in your hair,brown actually can fade but while fading in the process the dye will grow out too, what i would sugest is to use some hair dye reliever that you can get at a beauty school or a hair solan. hope this helps some...|`|KGppArcfaa	You cannot under any circumstances dye extensions lighter. It will ruin the cuticle and that means your extensions will be garbage.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to wash them with a clarifying shampoo a couple times|`|kQ2LCu3Eaa	No|`|0HYG8PlNaa	I did the same thing only it was my natural hair I dyed to black. I used Suave shampoo every single day and it made the dark dye fade so much faster to my natural hair color of light brown. I wouldn't dye over it either. just wash with suave it has the highest ph balance and that is why it works to fade your color.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Only if you wash your extensions...It will fade some, But it most likely won't fade all the way.

aeL8F2qeaa	i always cut my own hair. i also have extensions like the girl in you pic. you can get them at sally beauty supply of $60-$90. they are clip-ins and last a really long time. i love mine. it takes only a few mins to put in and you can style them how ever you want. the look your going for is really easy with extensions.<br>  <br>  and when you want to cut your hair just use scissors and cut down. never cut up or to the side when cutting layers. there are videos online that can show you haw to cut them, and its not really that hard. i have cut my own and my friends for a few years now and i am only 16 so its pretty simple. :] you can also use any razor as well. it doesnt have to be one like what they use in salons, you could use just a regular shaving razor.<br>  <br>  o and make sure the look is right for your face. depending on your face structure other looks may be better  for you. the first video below will tell about that.<br>  <br>  the second one will show you how to cut your hair. the video is for a asian haircut but that is pretty much what you are going for anyway. she is using a pair of scissors that you probably dont own. if you try to do the same thing with regular scissors i advise you to be careful. you may not get the cut you want. you can start it with normal scissors but i would suggest touching it up with a razor :]<br>  <br>  i hope this helped :]<br>  happy cutting|`|cEIpOQAKaa	Well, the girl in the picture has extensions in so buy some of those first..and if you want even more layers, take some scissors, point them downward and cut your hair, then it wont give you choppy layers.|`|sVrA4AVSaa	to get hair more 'scene' use a razor, it will make it more layered and choppier then scissors|`|XIQi78eEaa	the exact same thing happened to me. i went to the hair salon to get the scene hair i wanted, but came back looking nothing like the picture i had brought in. so then i cut my own hair, and suprisingly it came out really well. cutting ur own hair is EXTREMELY hard and you'll need to go really slow and carefully. my parents are so impressed with the way i cut my hair that they let me cut my brother hairs. he loves the haircut i gave him. but anyway, if you really want to cut ur own hair you need to be really careful. get a pair of really good metal scissors, not some cheap owns with the plastic on the fingers, and go slow. you'll want to start my cutting ur bangs, cut them in the style you want. when youre down with that, dont just cut the sides of ur hair. in the picture you have shown, you probably dont realize it, but the girl has hair extensions. thats why she has such long hair on the bottom and such short hair on the top. so if you dont want to have to get hair extentions, heres how to cut the sides, (just so you know, its not going to turn out exactly the same as the girl in the picture because you wont have as much hair to work with as she does)... take about half of ur hair (the top layer) and slowly cut it shorter and shorter. you want to do this in sections, and dont cut straight across or it will look like you have a bowl hair cut, also dont cut each piece the same length, that will also give you a bowl hair cut. leave the back of ur head long. just cut a few tiny pieces shorter in the back, but dont worry about them so much. if you want to be able to tease ur hair and make it stick up like some scene girls do, you have to cut a few pieces on the very top pretty short.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope ive helped!!!!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Next time take in a picture to your stylist.<br>  You're braver than me if you're going to do your own cut.<br>  I wouldn't risk it. Save up the money and have it done professionally. Or better yet, call the stylist back that did you last cut and tell her you are not happy with the cut and ask her to redo it like the picture.|`|JbSebJJYaa	Go to another salon<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional
KPNTniA1aa	nope. how would it make your eyebrows look bushier?|`|1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	Your eyebrows should look bushy or bushier only if they are that way to begin with. In getting a haircut that shouldn't make it look this way.|`|kQ2LCu3Eaa	Yes
2ZsRAxkuaa	Ville Valo?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.hugi.is/hudflur/103076.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.hugi.is/hudflur/103076.jpg</a><br>  <br>  But with proper fleur de lis', rather than just random spikey bits and a bit larger would look nice. Well I think so anyway.
bKYhBGcHaa	layers around the face and long jaggy fringe|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I would get a longer in the front, shorter in the back cut. That should elongate your face a little. I wouldn't do extensions.|`|uLHyDOm1aa	extentions will look good as long hair will make a wide face appear less fatter and it will hide the wideness round the back of the jaw which makes your face appear circle-like. stay clear away from face-shaping bobs as this will make your head look big. sharp frindges could stop a circle-like apperance and make your head look sweet and perky.|`|3C5mYdOAaa	well long bangs that go from the bridge of your nose and angled down to a little over you chin will help shape your face and focus people's eyes to more of the middle of the face instead of the outline of the face|`|AA11818569	a messy bob with a sharp fringe would look good
2ZsRAxkuaa	Ditch the neosporin. Horrible stuff.<br>  You could try saline? It'll just help any tears a bit. And vitamin E oil massages are never a bad thing. <br>  Mainly just warm water soaks for cleaning. <br>  And we don't have Dial soap here. But what I know of it, is that it isn't great. Try satin or provon soap instead.<br>  <br>  But I don't think its infected (its hard to do), you probably just tore it.<br>  Downsize a little more if you still keep having problems.<br>  I had to go back to 1/2" recently because of my unstretchable ear.<br>  <br>  Leave it at least a month before you stretch again. Probably longer.<br>  And I'd try taping with PTFE next time instead. Its much smaller stretches that way, rather than a great big 3-4mm jump. Just make sure to use lots and lots of lube.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Well there are tiny tears in most stretches, just some are an awful lot more drastic than others. And once a biggish tear happens, lobes can swell and be painful pretty quickly. But I wouldn't worry too much. If its still playing up in a few days, downsize a little more.<br>  Oh and ice compresses and ibruprofen will help for swelling.<br>  <br>  Infections take quite while to take hold, so I still maintain it isn't likely to be that. And they hurt like hell and come with nasty smelly green pus and stuff. And your glands swell up quite alot too. You can't get a mild infection, its gross or nothing normally.<br>  If you are worried though, go see your local piercer, and they'll be able to tell you. Don't be afraid to go to the doctors and ask for some broad spectrum antibiotics either.

g6Vci5SUaa	Your pulse points, as your blood is closer to the skin and warms the fragrance up, spreading it farther.  That would include the inside of your wrists, the sides of your neck, back of the knees, between your breasts.  I also put some on the back of my neck.  I had a girlfriend who did this, and when you stood behind her in a line she smelled great.  Sometimes I place some on my hair, too.  I usually don't perfume my clothing, though they do pick up some of the scent from my body.|`|AA12196905	pulse  points    wrists    in between the breasts    and behind the ears|`|qlue3FrXaa	You should always put it on your clothes .. But a good place to put it on your body is behind your ears and behind your knees because the hormones there put off the scent stronger than any other place on your body. :)|`|zFwjZy53aa	on the lower part of your neck|`|jeX5VZAtaa	On your chest and shoulders.|`|rYX6Owfraa	behind your ears. the warmth from your hair activates the scent and makes it stronger|`|vJRMmgd6aa	i hope you mean on your body?  the best time to put fragrance on is when u get out of the shower cause your skin will absorb it better!  and a spritz on clothing is always ok too|`|noUZuLV8aa	i wud like to know that too =)))

You can try it if you want just see if it works, I don't think it really works though.|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	well it all depends on how much lemon jusic u put in it and if u put alot it would make it very light so u probrably just need to add a little bit|`|BKOgIfwHaa	Lemon juice will lighten your hair a bit or brighten the blonde color at least. It will not lighten enough to be afraid to try it ...a suggestion I have for you is that if you want to lighten a bit and still in control try the spray SUN IN. I use this during the winter just so I don't get that dull look that can happen when not in the sun as much and it is cheaper than a box dye. One bottle could last a whole winter/summer season ..just be sure to condition your hair well when washing.|`|7df573746dd6a85c2a8f383acdd3aefbaa	My mom did that and it turned her hair WHITE.

FVWvN07xaa	you're gettin A-B and you want be a beauty therapist..  Wow..   you can do so much better, and get a more decent job..   but if you wanna do beauty then you need to go to college, and do NVQ LVL 2 and then NVQ LVL 3.  Good you need alot off money, if your over 19 you're gonna have to pay for the course, which will be like 1,200 a year..   But if you're near london, that's great! you'll have a really good chance of owning your own place.   Good luck :)|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Look at local colleges that offer beauty therapy courses.|`|W9GFv2VMaa	my mate does it an is at level 2 NVQ or something, she didnt have any GCSEs. they're not that important but it does help to start at a higher level.|`|Z82og7b7aa	Many colleges do it and you have more than enough qualifications to do the course :) i don't think you really need any qualifications to be honest :) im not sure where abouts in London you can go as i don't live there but im sure if you research it on the internet you will find something :)    i hope this helps     xx

87yovKYlaa	everything matters to teenagers, but as you get older it matters less. there are some like my son who likes the person not just the package but most don't pay attention to guys like him cause he is tall and chubby and he too has acne. personally for scars you can't remove them but you can make them less visible. rose hip oil will soften the appearance of scars. if they are dark scars you can use hydroquinone found in fade creams. it will work if you apply it only to the scar and not on the surrounding skin. otherwise it will lighten the surrounding skin too and make the scar even more noticeable. you can also visit the dermatologist for a light chemical peel. using an exfoliator no more than every other day can help exfoliate the surface layer and speed up the cell turn over rate which will help the healthy non scarred skin underneath surface quicker. i say no more than every other day cause to do so too much can actually damage and slow your cell turn over rate and make it appear worse not better.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Don't fret it.

It looks like an old school cesarean scar (my mother and I actually have matching stomachs! ) ... but I've had plenty of healthy relationships with boys who don't care and, not that it's okay, but hook ups with guys and they never seem to mind. Sometimes they ask but I don't think it's a big deal.    As for not wearing shorts or dresses... For the longest time I was the same way but somewhere along the line you'll realize that you're beautiful the way you are. It's easy for others to say "get over it and wear whatever" but I understand it can be scary to think of everyone seeing all of you're self proclaimed "flaws"... the rest of the world hardly notices and if they do it's because they are insecure about themselves.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	They won't and don't care about them if they really LOVE you.

Try rubbing Vitamin E oil on the marks, it's inexpensive and fades scars.  Jergens also has a lotion that firms up skin.  Also for the body scars from shaving and bacne, try an exfoliating body wash. Don't give up and say you'll never find your love, you're a teenager and you have a lot of time.|`|xhjSPd0uaa	hun you really need to buy PURE VITAMIN E OIL  rub it on the scarred areas every night (every morning AND night if possible) and it gets rid of scars, it'll take a while to notice a difference but it really works!!  it got rid of my chicken pox scars on my face, my friends acne scars, and my auntys badly stretchmarked tummy after pregnancy!    its well known to fade scars quickly

zpovg4U7aa	The best I've used was GoSmile from Sephora. It's the most convenient and effective, but I find that it's pricey if you need more than one case (I'm pretty sure each case is around $80 - $90).<br>  <br>  I've tried Crest Night Effects, which ended up being really annoying and gross. It's this white goo you apply onto your teeth before you go to sleep. You have to make sure that your teeth are completelyyyy dry which is hard because you're sitting there in front of the mirror cheesin' like crazy to keep your teeth in contact with nothing but air. And you wipe the tooth with a cloth, then apply then you wait thirty seconds for the goo to dry a bit. It tastes disgusting; I feel like it should be used to mend bricks together or something. Not going to lie, though - it did make my teeth a bit whiter. Not significantly, but then I never finished using it.<br>  <br>  Then there's Crest Whitestrips, which they sell in three different types (I think Premium is the one that works the quickest with the strongest formula, and Classic is the one that takes the longest with a weaker - but equally effective - formula). I got the Classic because it's half the price of Premium, and I heard that in the end you get the same results as the Premium (Premium takes seven days, and Classic takes fourteen days). You apply the strip for thirty minutes, twice a day. It's not a hassle, and it's pretty convenient. You don't have to dry your teeth, you just apply the strip directly on and leave it on for thirty while you do whatever. It's definitely worked.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long but with all the info I have I would recommend Crest Whitestrips the most (Premium is around $40 and Classic is around $20 at a drugstore). They work, they don't burn a hole in your pocket, and isn't disgusting like the Night Effects, which I stopped using it after four days by the way. I think you're supposed to use it for ten days).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|76wDSDg8aa	Crest Whitening Strips!|`|rIr781BXaa	chew on a licorice root from a health storee. it helps.|`|4TN6LSVQaa	the crest white strips|`|6ZuzSN3eaa	Any whitening product will weaken your teeth and actually make them easier to get stained again. Think of it as removing stains from silver using polish. It just will be fine at first, but in the long run will get stained again and have less next time. So if you're using whitening strips, take a calcium supplement so your teeth can heal. In fact, take calcium anyways; everyone needs 200mg of it a day, and no one gets enough.|`|AA11172374	I used the ZOOM light system, I work in a dental office.  It worked<br>  great, and is the fastest.  But expensive.    I have also used Opalescence gel, 20% strength, with custom trays.  It worked fine too.  I touch-up with Crest whitestrips occasionally.  But I <br>  don't smoke or drink coffee, EVER.  I drink tea occasionally.<br>  So I only need to touch-up about once or twice a year.|`|XsqlvtI9aa	I too have tried all kinds of things from natural and free to thousand of dollar treatments , and they worked , but needless to say  , I now know that it was not worth the effort. There's this one product that you can actually get for free , if they happen to give it away at the time you drop by .  I'm telling you , If I would have found this the first time , I would have saved myself a whole lot of time and effort . It's too late for me now , but maybe not for you .

It takes a little more time than just using the white strips but it will give you better results its totally worth it if you really want white teeth!

a0Pa51z1aa	there is one primary rule:<br>  <br>  Well exposing/displaying cleavage hide your legs, and when showing legs, cover up your cleavage.<br>  <br>  You always want to leave something to the imagination, and if your all legs and chest then your just being slutty. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also always flaunt your assets, and make sure you get proper fitting undergarments and clothing. A great fitting pair of jeans can do wonders for your legs and butt. <br>  <br>  What type of figure are you? : boy, athletic, curvy, pear, big on top, big hips ?|`|ztj8nBzOaa	During the spring and summer you can wear skirts or sun dresses.  For right now though you can wear v-cut long sleeves shirts with jeans and either uggs or boots.  You can wear like beige pants with heels and a sweater.  It all depends on how you normally dress.|`|UHlfLVczaa	I'm British Too =]<br>  <br>  Mini Skirt And Strappy Heels<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  A little black dress <--YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH THAT!<br>  Show a little leg or chest never both cuz that makes you look like a ....... :] i watched it on gok wan :D Red is very cool it makes you look shy but hot! =] Lool have fun with Styllee|`|GN5MC1U7aa	I think you should embrace what makes you look good regardless of looking trampy like a little black dress from 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' to skinny jeans with a polo neck or vest.|`|GI6OjU0faa	tight jeans!|`|yyvcryrbaa	dress  how you want to dress & we'll look.
87yovKYlaa	depends on your skin type. coco butter is great for dry ashy skin. aloe for dry irritated skin, green tea for acne skin. but make sure you avoid the main irritants in lotions of any kind. mineral oil. if  its in the first 10 ingredients then it will irritate your skin and make it worse not better.|`|LJbhOhKuaa	Lotion Aloe its the best! Helps with sunburn!

Imagine how cold all that metal would be on the skin in the winter.  Imagine all those metal zipper under the hot sun.  OUCH!  Whoever wears it would be branded with hundreds of little zipper tooth marks.  It will probably make an appearance on some celebrityy somewhere, a few fashion victims might buy it, and then it will gointot the made a good headline fashion hall of shame, along with other forgotten fads.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think it's pretty cute but you would have to <br>  have the perfect body shape to wear that.|`|m1QQwnSdaa	oh dear! theres a lotttttt of zippers on that dress!<br>  idk i like it because it's unique and no one will have the same dress as you! but then again it's kinda boring...<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|VYMOwgc3aa	It's interesting, but honestly, I think it would look trashy on anyone other than that model.

xUy7B5vDaa	Hey Hon,    Firstly i have to tell you that i've honestly tried so many different fake tans, tinted moisturisers etc and to tell you the truth i think products work differently for different people.     I have dry and sensitive skin which is pale too and found fake tan too harsh and always came out blotchy where my skin is dry even when i used exfoliator and moisturised beforehand, grr! lol BUT... I finally found something great for me which is L'oreal Summertime tinted moisturiser. Its a great light shade which gives me a healthy glow! and if im going out for the night i just 'up the dosage' and use for a couple of nights in a row.     Whatever you decide to use i really suggest that you make sure you exfoliate and let your moisturiser sink in after before applying!    All the best! x|`|BqMoGMZbaa	try this : http://www.lookfantastic.com/beauty/bene...  :)|`|uNpcUcPTaa	dove or johnsons are meant to be the best, gradually build it up to a colour that suits u and as its a moisturisor, it doesnt go on streaky!|`|zWBnTqmjaa	Yep jhonsons holiday skin is great just put it on after shower and u get a great glow that lasts  plus your not giving yourself anything nasty from using sunbeds. .|`|VGdZRg1vaa	you should try that but how about going into a spar and getting into one of those beds with all those lights on you =) good luck|`|BUCwZYnzaa	what i love is the jergens darkening lotion. you can get the dollar general version for like 3 dollars. it is regular everyday moisturizer and it is tinted i love it and it is safe|`|kps9h1QBaa	Yeah i have pale skin too and i burn easy so i use Jonsons holiday skin it just builds up a natural looking tan and it moiturises! :D ITS WELL GOOD|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	I have tried some and they do work but make sure you rub in all of the moisturiser and wash your hands after.|`|wmBK9uASaa	My wife is pale and she uses moisturizing tan lotions which she finds very good, the best one she found id the Loreal one....|`|bM1TrzGjaa	Yes they are, Loreal is the best as it's non smudgy. Much better than the tanning wipes- my opinion their crap.  The best tanning mouse is piz buin, it's quite pricey but worth it. Try to grab a bargian bottle on ebay but be shure to ask for the use by date as u dont want to be ripped off.|`|8b1qUXEaaa	yeah the tinted moisturiser is not good it goes all streaky, try rimmel sun shimmer instant tan, i really like that and if you dont then it comes straight off when you wash it|`|a6138e092d07f6d19d5c478c75935469aa	My girlfriend is scottish and pale skinned. She has used the dove moisturiser that gives you a subtle colour over a period of time. it works but can be patchy. You need to exfoliate like crazy before you start and everytime you apply you have to exfoliate. It really took for ages to apply. She now just uses a fake tan when she is going somewhere special. Good luck    She swears by fake bake is by far the best. Its not cheap but really is the best. I dont like fake tans because they leave her smelling of stale digestive biscuits lol. Im not kidding it really stays aswell . I can smell a girl wearing fake tan in a club aswell they smell like they work for Mcvities lol|`|FOsd9DP6aa	Johnson's Holiday Skin :)  Just make sure you use even amounts everywhere and do it daily, and you'll build a natural looking tan.   Oh and make sure you wash your hands after :|  :)      Or you could just embrace your pale skin, I know people who'd die to have pale skin (:|`|AA11349881	Yes they are good,have a go.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Try Fake Bake from John Lewis.

TkuZ9Hsoaa	hot-oil treatment! massage warm oil into your scalp and then shampoo it off, gives u gr8 healthy and shiny hair! use Almond or olive oil for better results!|`|p0D4dxEqaa	I have found that Head and Shoulders moisture shampoo and conditioner solved my dry scalp and made my hair shine.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	It may be Psoriasis. You may want to check & see.  However, warm climate can dry your skin out in general, I am from Louisiana so I know.  I have long, thick hair & have used Pantene Pro-V for years.  It leaves my hair smelling great & I can actually run my fingers through my hair when I shower with it in my hair.  Keeps my hair shiny too.  It's a lil costlier than Suave but it's well worth it.  Tresemme would be my second choice.  Good Luck!|`|X0iKNAlTaa	Like said before, you can do a hot oil treatment.  If you don't want to buy one from a store, try heating up some olive oil until it is warm and then applying with a cottonball to your scalp.  Leave it on for a couple of hours for best results.  You want to rinse with a moisturizing shampoo such as head and shoulders (I prefer a tea tree oil shampoo), and make sure to massage your scalp as you do so.  Also condition all the time.  Also, once a week you want to do a deep conditioning to you your hair to keep it at the top.  Don't use really hot water, and avoid using excessive heat all the time.  Allow your hair to air dry, and don't use a flat iron or curling iron without using a heat protecting product on it first to help protect.|`|xhKYHGvIaa	Do not use 2-1 shampoos if you have a dry scalp. It just makes it worst. Vo5 hot oil treatments are good once every other week. Try not washing your hair everyday. It does wonders for the scalp because your hair will actually wash its self. Conditioner is the key. Find a brand that is specifically for dry scalp. For shampoo and conditioner I would try Aveda for dry hair. You can find it in hair salons and I personally think its the best shampoo out there. If you dont have the cash for that then I would suggest trying Paul Fredia for your colored hair. Again conditioner is the KEY!! Good luck, I hope one of these suggestions help!|`|goCugDOKaa	Like the person above said, use a hot oil treatment.  Also, get a good conditioner.  Use a moisturizing shampoo.  When you condition regularly, leave it in for a few minutes before you rinse.  Also, massage your scalp.
PwxREEQPaa	Probably the flat iron. Who ever did your hair held the iron too long in one spot. I would just re-wash it and let it air dry other wise what helps get a straight look to it without the flat iron is after you wash it, put a little bit of a straightening spay, just a litte otherwise it will give a greasy texture to it. Then, carefully comb through it, but not to much cuz when you comb while it is wet, it causes breakage....not good! Then, blow dry it and brush it at the same time, but don't hold the blow dryer to close, otherwise you'll get that burnt smell. Do that until it dry. Also, I would try using Herbal Essences, I believe it's called Envy, it's in the orange bottle,but it smells AWESOME!!! Use the shampoo and conditioner.  hope this info helps!|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I think it's the flat iron. I love the Chi, but I use it so sparingly because my hair smells unclean and burnt (plus it's terrible for your hair). Buy products that smell really good, like Herbal Essences or something.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I'd say probably the flat iron too. Why don't you give the salon a ring and tell them about it and see what they say? You went for a hair cut, not a hair smell!|`|6IjBUqAfaa	I think its the flat iron they used on your hair.|`|OZDHQyN3aa	well maybe your hair didn't react for the first year or so,but my stepdad ate chocolate for thirteen years and now has an allergic reaction so you should call your stylist  it wasn't the flat iron beacuse they dont make hair smell that bad especially if you have washed it two times after the ironing    it is probably a chemical smell so avoid gel ,spray, leave in conditioner, and unpermanent dye until you have rached the stylist
cLGVSuFqaa	wow you look exactly like your avataar|`|MoUtk7cUaa	you're just a kid, relax. things change. even if someone said this to you, someone else will say the exact opposite, even if it's eventually. remember (i know this for fact) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. when i was your age, i was always unattractive at best, i think i still am, but i have no trouble getting a woman that i find attractive now.|`|dWwIEqEwaa	honey, you shouldn't do this too yourself.

What are you going to do about the imperfections on your face, if someone tells you yes? Go get plastic surgery? or sit and worry about it all the time? Some people are going to tell you that your pretty, and some people are going to tell you that you aren't and chance are you'll wind up feeling worse than before. These sort of questions aren't good for a person's self esteem, which you are obviously lacking because you asked it in the first place. Seriously, this **** is annoying.|`|D7QdvWYDaa	Your not ugly (BTW-I hate that word) and you should never ue that word to describe yourself or ask a question about your looks. I love the first picture, your eyelashes are so long and beautiful looking and you have gorgeous hair. I love the way it shines, has body and is swept to the right.  Your make-up is light and perfect for your complexion. <br>  <br>  WHo said anything about you being ugly? Your such a beautiful and gorgeous young lady, I bet your boyfriend thinks so, right?<br>  <br>  The only comment I will make and I hope you don't get upset is. This is from "Rachel Zoe" the famous stylist to the stars in her new book, "A to Zoe" is your nails. I love the black color nail polish your wearing, it looks super but she mentions, "the first thing a person sees when you approach them is your hands, so if you have chipped nail color, you should either fix it right away or remove it completely before making contact with your friends. I realise wearing nail colours is sometimes "high maintenance" but they have these nail polish remover pads in a small sealed packet that you could carry in your handbag, pull one out and remove the old polish or if you have time, touch up the polish or redo it completely.|`|c1pM8o1Iaa	I think you are very beautiful. Actually, you look a lot like i did when i was younger, so maybe I am biased. I did not see any at all, but imperfections are what make true beauty.

xnBnbYBgaa	ask your salon tech to check your hair and see if she thinks you are good for a stripping. no not your clothes! dont do it at home tho! your tech may not do it if your hair is too damaged but its worth a shot. also you can put lemon juice on it and sit in the sunlight. its a natural lightener.|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Wait for it to grow back and buy shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair and shampoo condition every 2/3 days also stop using hair straighteners and curlers for a few months.|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	go to the salon and let them lighten it, it might take like twice but thats really the only way|`|fMvP3BIFaa	Oh my god I had the same problem. Go to the hair salon and ask to get your hair dyed with a DEMI color. ITs not really a dye its a stein. It has nutrients and will do wonders for your hair.

8f7fc67bddf41816c3fe7608e723a824aa	Forget Veet and Nair, those have NEVER worked for me. Instead, try Surgi Cream. It is relatively cheap and extremely effective. It is also less abrasive and won't burn your skin. It can be found in most drugstores.    I think that they contain a chemical that kind of just desolves the hair. Most brands contain ones that are just way too harsh for most types of skin.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	Surprisingly, Aspercreme.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	I never have worked that out. Back years ago, when I was at University, I used to drive cabs part-time and the drivers had a thing about women who got so drunk they passed out in the cab. (we had to get the Police - we couldn't throw them out like we could with guys - and it took an hour or two out of our shift) so we used to put hair remover cream on one eyebrow and down the middle of their head. Different drivers argued about which cream was the best but I really couldn't say.  I was never bold enough to call one of them and ask.     One thing I'm sure of, they wouldn't pass out in a cab again...|`|BqMoGMZbaa	veet is good|`|07tN71zYaa	i dnt realli use hair removal creams myself but my friends all brag that Nair does an excellent job

1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	wear trousers, skirts and tops which elongate your figure... terefore making you look slimmer.     tops with a v-neck, trousers/jeans with a slight flare or that just go straight down and skirts wich hit the knees. if, like me u cant wear high heels, a kitten heel will do the trick just as well.   all these styles take the look away from the middle and draw the eye away.  will make you appear taller and slimmer.     good luck!|`|K7usHFX0aa	Torrid.com is the best. You're not overweight either, your gorgeous. =)|`|ixXzqchGaa	actually what you are wearing in the first pic isnt that bad, Black makes you look slim, wearing a body suit underneath your cloths will also help.|`|njbmqjCTaa	I stand by my answer in your previous post. But now that I see your actual body, you do not look heavy at all! And that first outfit is cute. I think you are just a normal woman and have big hips/thighs, which is fine. Your style looks fine as is.|`|CecQFtDvaa	wear straight legged jeans with no flare!! and the darker the jean the better!! another thing when your trying on jeans make sure they arent to tight on your thighs!! also wear like tops that come in right under your boobs and then go back out like a baby doll shirt.  as for makeup i would pluck your eyebrows and wear foundation but make sure its the right color, for your eyes in the morning put on eyeliner (but not too much) and then curl your eye lashes and put on mascara, lipgloss and lipstick are also good  if you are not sure what makeup to wear you can go to nordstroms or macys and they can give you a makeover with and tell you what makeup to wear  for you hair i cant tell if it is but dont part it in the middle and dont brush it back, brush it down (sorry if this doesnt make sence)     hope this helps  good luck|`|of049X1waa	Wear clothes that are tight enough to show off your curves, without calling attention to the overweight bits... like a snug tank top, but not a super skintight belly shirt.  Like Marilyn Monroe says, "tight enough to show you're a woman, loose enough to show you're a lady!"|`|9588cdbc442a95ac1aa8ac08a7facdacaa	The most important element is to buy clothes that fit well. We all know that dark colors are slimming and heels help. The biggest mistake a lot of ppl make is to wear the wrong size (even slender people) baggy clothes can make you look frumpy and often bigger than you are. Too small clothes that accentuate every bump. If you want to look firm a support style body suit really helps - but may not be very comfy so you might save for times you want to look your best. Good undergarments make a huge diff. A camisole under a sweater or blouse will keep it from getting hung up on unbecoming folds of skin. A bra that fits properly, underwear that fits nicely and has smooth seams reduce panty lines (I bought some great 1 size fits all ones at modern maternity when I was pregnant and still use them. Slips under skirts and dresses keep them looking their best. For casual look pic one looks fine. Tops that look good un-tucked and layered w/ a jacket or sweater can take attention of the waistline.

In a kind a sensitive way. Maybe suggest a new hair style or just tell him you think he could pull more ladies with a different style. However if the "jew fro" is something your friend associates with himself then maybe that is how he wants too look..      Good luck|`|DpMnmrK8aa	If you are a true friend you would tell him your honest opinion but do not make fun of it/him/her, say it in the best way you can.

Au4gWgEiaa	Hypertrophic scarring will go away on its own.  It's most common with cartilage piercings, I had it on my helix a month after I had it done.  It might take longer than you would like to go away, but you will not have to take out your piercing.  <br>  <br>  All I did was continue to clean it once a day and added extra sea salt soaks and it went away without a trace.  Sea salt soaks should be 1/8 teaspoon salt to 1 cup of water.  Get it as hot as you can without burning yourself and soak for at least 10 minutes.  Any less and you will just be getting the piercing wet.|`|7f470211cac73cf1d4d69ada59f60764aa	If the chamomile tea bags don't reduce the size of the scar after a week, you might want to try tea tree oil. You can buy it at Walgreens or CVS, but it's very, very harsh. I'd suggest mixing it half and half with grape seed or jojoba oil to reduce the chances of dryness and irritation.<br>  <br>  If dryness or irritation does occur, start adding vitamin E oil to it.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Tea tree oil and hot soaks :]|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	I'd ditch the soap by now. I just use it for the first week, it can dry everything out and most is still too harsh.. I fiind saline much better. But you need to make sure you use SEA salt, table salt can cause problems. Use a max of 1/4tsp, but an 1/8tsp is better in a whole cup of boiled water. You can also buy it in big premixed bottles cheaply.<br>  <br>  And for the hypertrophic scar...<br>  I use cammomile soaks. Make a cup of boiling  100% cammomile tea. Lt it cool, and then dump the teabag on your belly for five minutes or so, once a day. Its really very good.<br>  But some people aso use one drop of tea tree oil once a day, though I'd try the cammomile first.<br>  <br>  It will go away. But that bar looks a little long. Don't change it until its healed. But the scar will normally sort itself out once jewellery is sorted out.<br>  <br>  (And I apologise for my rubbish keyboard)

sHUnctqIaa	There's no magical skin product that will cure your oily skin, the amount of oil your body secrets is directly related to your endocrine system. The best thing to do is keep your skin in balance. Don't use drying cleansers, especially if they are very soapy or foamy. They may strip all the oil off your skin but as soon as they do your body gets to work producing more oil and then some. Stripping your skin and using drying products only creates a vicious cycle. Find a good cleanser, and follow with a toner to re-balance your PH. I like Burts bees garden tomato toner for oily skin, or anything with cucumber. After that follow with a skin balancing moisturizer or light cream. Putting lipids and vitamins on your skin through non pore clogging products will prevent your body from over producing oil. <br>  <br>  Finally, start taking a zinc supplement every day. Zinc supports immune function and the endocrine system, meaning it will prevent your body from producing excess oil. Take it with Vitamin C for maximum absorbtion.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	I like oil blotting sheets you can get them at Wal-Mart but the best ones are from Sallys.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Take a juice of any fruit (orange, sweet lime, watermelon or papaya) and apply on the face as a mask.

Wear a hat & go to a hair salon so they can see what has been done & fix your hair for you.  Once you go, you will see why people go to school for hair.  We can't do everything.  Just do it, cus you'll never be happy til they fix it & don't chance your hair getting damaged/dry.|`|aeL8F2qeaa	no it doesnt work that way.<br>  i bleached my hair over the summer then dyed it auburn which is like a red brown. i then dyed over that with brown. two months ago i used a semi perm colour and now it has fadded out. my hair is still brown.<br>  if you want to fix the red just dye your hair with a perm brown. the darker the better.<br>  <br>  i hope that helped :]

BSMlEEKLaa	To get a good walk you have to practice. Balancing a book on your head does help, and always keep your head up and never look at the guests unless that's what the client specifically asks you to do.     Practice infront of a mirror awkward/intresting poses so that you stand out from other girls, just telling you what poses to do will make you no different to other models :P    The only tip I can really give you is to put your best pictures at the front of your portfolio because if the agency doesn't like what they see they will not look at the others..  And also, you're going to get torn down so many times, don't give up :)    But yeah, good luck :)|`|OHfZFR31aa	There are tons of runway videos on style.com, youtube, and other fashion sites.

uij93NOjaa	Well, its really hard to do pink over a dark color. Also, it depends on how bright you want it. If you want it really bright then you have to bleach the strands you want pink and then do pink over the bleached spots. It's really a big process and if your scared to do it yourself, you should go have a professional do it. You also might not like it. I suggest going to a beauty store by your house and purchasing the non-permanent dye just to see :-)|`|TCJQEUbXaa	In order to get those bright colors you have to first strip the pigment or bleach the hair color out then dye on top, I would go to a professional to get this done.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	If you want your hair to turn pink the best thing to do is get your hair down to a blonde first.  You would have to bleach out the strips you want pink before dying it pink.  Sun will fade out your pink.  If you want it brighter get it bleached, that is the only thing I can tell you to do.  Pink works best on blondes.|`|aeL8F2qeaa	the pink dye wont show well on the black.<br>  if you want it to come out brighter i would suggest getting white out from hot topic. you can order it online if you need to. it is basically just a bleach but it works great. after you bleach your hair, then put the pink on and touch it up every few weeks with the pink. your colour will be stronger if you do it more than once (as long as it is not a chemical based colour). i recommend raw colour (also from hot topic). it is what i use and it is amazing. all it is is a stain so you can wash it out :] and it doesnt have a chemical smell to it like normal dyes do.<br>  <br>  you can get everything online or in you local hot topic store :]<br>  <br>  hope this helped :]|`|wsC2g0Dbaa	You are going to have to bleach the parts that you want pink before dying them otherwise your hair is still going to be dark.|`|cB9j7YAQaa	tsk tsk<br>  natural is the way to go.<br>  if you want to go drastic, get it professionally done girl|`|Z47UMSeiaa	ma id think u look coo jus the way u r

UtXMcMNlaa	This could be happening due to genetics (things passed down from your mom and dad). But, sometimes this can start to happen if you wear tight ponytails a lot or you bed. The constant pulling of the pony tail can break off the hair at the hairline. Don't freak out though, as this is a totally normal thing!<br>  <br>  p.s. gel won't do this to you, so don't worry about it.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	You have the gene for hair loss - which usually kicks in around puberty.  That's the short of it.  Probably your dad or grandfather were balding, and you got it.  You may be able to use Rogaine or something to combat it, but you should discuss it with your family and doctor first.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	It is not abnormal.  It happened to my husband at a very young age too.|`|iW065Tmsaa	Actually the gene comes from the mothers side.. so if your moms dad was bald you know who to blame. =)
RKbxxjJuaa	If you have oily hair, or you use a product that your hair doesn't agree with and you get heavy buildup, you can sprinkle baking soda in your regular (or a really cheap) shampoo and it will work better than ANY expensive salon quality stripping shampoo....your hair will feel SQUEAKY clean!  I do this at least once a month.  Also, although this doesn't pertain exactly, here's another beauty tip:  Shaving your legs with conditioner as opposed to shaving cream works like a dream, which was especially beneficial news to me as I always have "left over" conditioner (since I buy shampoo and conditioner together and never use the conditioner as fast as the shampoo) :)|`|mMfXWjeSaa	If you are looking to be fun for a day and experiment with at home beauty tricks....here are my top ideas:<br>  <br>  Shampoo alternative:  Use BEER!  (Preferably a heavy beer like a Guinness).  This will make your hair unbelieveably shiny!<br>  <br>  Conditioner alternative:  A trick my mom and her friends used to use in college...MAYO!!!  This will give you such soft hair.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	In my opinion, you should stick with shampoo. If you can't do that, try soap.

kAp2lRxpaa	moisture darling... what you do is buy hello hydration in the Herbal Essence stuff its in a blue bottle... this makes your hair a little less crackly... and one other thing is when you get out of the shower... towel dry your hair and while it is still damp get a dab of your conditioner(whichever you use, the hydration one would be best) and rub it in your hands then run it down your hair... this lets the stuff soak into the ends and makes for a beautiful mane...<br>  <br>  you can also use different products but as to save money you can just use you conditioner...|`|goCugDOKaa	get a really good conditioner.  You should do a hot oil treatment at least once a month... you can get this at Walmart or the drugstore or something.  When you use your regular conditioner, leave it on in the shower for a few minutes before rinsing it out.  When you get out of the shower, towel dry and comb out your hair with a wide tooth comb and work a smoothing serum through your hair.  I like Farouk Silk Therapy or Bed Head After Party.  You can either use the hair dryer or let it air dry.  If you use the hair dryer, use a diffuser and spray on some sort of heat protecter (Tresseme makes a good one).  And use an ionic hair dryer.Your hair will not be dry if you try to keep it healthy.  The best way to keep it healthy is to keep it nourished and protected.|`|iwCYJ18faa	Use a moisturizing shampoo, as well as a reliable leave-in product, such as a conditioner or serum.

CkIeCNS4aa	I wear my navel barbell all the time and have never had a problem.  My fiance wore his labret all the time, when he had it pierced.  I have to take my nostril piercing (stud) out at night so I don't lose my jewelry, but some people's piercings will close over night.  I think that if the piercing healed well, it's comfortable enough to sleep in, and you maintain it well it should be okay to wear all the time.  If your body is prone to healing quickly, you might need to wear the body jewelry all the time so that it doesn't close up over night.  If it's uncomfortable to wear metal jewelry 24/7, try a retainer made out of a flexible material.|`|5ldcp8FKaa	i wouldn't tolerate that so don't have that done. don't leave it on

LEypSiRpaa	It could be a number of things. There's a possibility that when it was re pierced it was favoring the side that hurts, of the original piercing. For example: Say the left side hurts. The new piercing is slightly to the left of the one you had 5 months ago. The scar tissue could be making it more sensitive. Along with ice water, and sea salt soaks, I would go back to the piercer and tell him what is going on. Don't wait too long to  try to find out what's going on with it.

So pick what you like and don't allow fashion to influence you.|`|6kxWMPEQaa	I am not sure "in" or "out" is the proper question. They are however very very over done.  They have been done more than any tattoo I can think of (although there are some others that have been done way too much as well).  I mean if it is something you really like and want on your body then it really doesn't matter if it is "in or out".  You should never get a tattoo because it is "in" because sure enough it is going to be "out" at some point and ur still going to have it on your body.  But on the other hand if it is something you really really like or has a meaning to you well then that will never go "out".     I personally am not a fan of tribal (even though my boyfriend does have some) just for the fact that the vast majority of the people who get it obviously  are not part of any tribe and tend to get it just because they want a tattoo and tribal looks "cool".|`|2SzYXPrHaa	I guess it depends on whether you're part of a tribe or not...|`|L4Bnecwoaa	It's not the type of tattoo that I'd cringe at when I saw it, the do looks good but they're soo common now and I doubt it actually means anything to you unless ur really into ancestry or tribal history or something.

8lDmtlOcaa	what my experience has been is that no over-the-counter product can equal prescription strength products for medium to serious acne. i know it works for a lot of people, and it sounds like proactiv has worked somewhat for you. i'd say maybe try doing your proactiv twice a day (once again at midday like you said) or just go to a dermatologist and get prescription strength stuff. retin-a and benzaclin have really worked to clear up my skin. skinid won't be too much different from proactiv. skinid and proactiv both have the same active ingredient: salicylic acid. salicylic acid is good, but it's not nearly as strong as what a prescription topical ointment/cream can do for you. if you don't want to do that, try blotting your face with just a regular kleenex or paper towel at midday, to get the oil off. don't rub, just blot. of course, you could buy the oil blotting strips, but in my opinion, that's a waste of money. i hope i helped!|`|87yovKYlaa	haven't used it but i do work with skin for a living. any product that over dries your skin will make it oilier later in the day as the skin over compensated for being stripped of its natural oils earlier in the day. look at your diet too. a really acidic diet can cause over oil production in the body. but i have never had any complaints about neutrogena products or aveno. they are both wonderful. as a skin care consultant and estheitician i personally hate proactive, i have seen it wreck more skin than i have seen it help.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	no i never used it but just try it out u will never no until u try
CplZXVwZaa	Hi hun,    An answer from a previous, similar question,  Credit to Yahoo! user chelseiann, clairolhair:    Your best bet is to visit Sally Beauty Supply and purchase salon quality brands that will be so much better for your hair.    I highly recommend Clairol Professional Instant Whip. It's a liquid lightener that is gentle on your hair. Instant Whip is safe for use on your scalp. It will cost you under $6 to buy Instant Whip and 20 volume developer at Sally.    http://www.sallybeauty.com    =====================================    If you're doing an all over blonde hair color, you'll have to apply hair bleach to the scalp, which can cause blistering and chemical burns. That's an extreme possibility, but could happen if you're not careful.    For on-scalp lightening processes, never mix bleach with a peroxide stronger than 20 Volume.    And keep in mind -- bleach just keeps on doin' it's thing until it either dries up or gets washed off.    Blonde hair color.    Pay attention to what's happening on your scalp. A normal hair bleaching process will cause a slightly uncomfortable tingle on the scalp, if the tingle progresses into a burning sensation, rinse the bleach off with cool water.    Bleach will lift existing hair color, especially dark colors more slowly than natural pigment.    Some inexpensive (drugstore brand) hair colors contain metallic salts which can turn your hair to mush if they're processed with bleach, perm solutions, or chemical straighteners. Check the ingredients if you've used a drugstore brand hair color to make sure it doesn't contain any metallic dye components.    If you aren't sure whether the existing color on your hair contains these dyes, snip a tiny section of hair from underneath and process it in a little of the bleach solution first. If you can pull it apart with your fingers after 10 or 20 minutes in the bleach solution, you'll know there's a problem. Darker colors contain more of this ingredient (in those particular brands), and the more you've used it, the more metallic salts will have been deposited on/in your hair.    PREPARE YOUR HAIR  For best results (and to avoid common color mishaps), make sure your hair is ready for the color.    Minerals from water, chlorine from swimming pools, and build-up from styling products can all impede the haircolor formula's ability to do it's thing.      Use Joico K-Pak Chelating Shampoo before coloring to help eliminate these impurities.    Using hair bleach is not a process to undergo if you value the health of your hair. It may come out feeling like straw and will be in dire need of protein/moisture treatments.    If you're coloring the regrowth of pre-lightened hair, be sure not to overlap the bleach when applying it.    If you get bleach on hair that's already been lightened, it could cause a chemical haircut. Never a good look!    Working in small sections will help you control the hair and ensure that the bleach gets only where you want it. Avoid squishing the hair down on top of previously bleached sections to prevent product transfer. If any bleach gets where you don't want it...even the smallest drip, blot it up with a towel and blast that piece of hair (or skin, clothing, furniture, etc...) with water immediately to stop the bleaching action.    One last word on using hair bleach safely...Wear gloves! Unless you like an unbearable biting sensation as chemicals eat away at your skin. I didn't think so. Good luck and have fun!     Toning hair is done to neutralize brassy (yellow or yellow/orange) pigments.    After bleaching hair is the most common time for using hair toner.    Because bleach leaves the hair in a raw-pigment state which is less-than-attractive, you need to add back pigments to create a "natural" look. So... whip up a toner!     Start applying the toner in the area that needs it the most. Avoid getting any of the formula on pieces that don't need toning (coating those sections with a bit of conditioner will help keep them from getting processed if you accidentally get color on them).    Let the toner process for the full time recommended by the manufacturer (usually 30-45 minutes). However, in cases where only slight toning is required, you can rinse it sooner.     In the end, you may end up saving yourself a lot of time and money (if you end up with a disastrous result and have to go to the salon anyway to correct it) if you just go to a professional.  Since you stated that it is not an option, I gave you information to do it yourself...but keep in mind, hair dressers STUDY this for a living.  Either way, good luck! =)    Hope this helps!  ?Aurora|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	i'd have to say Loreal becasue when i use it it works fantastic|`|aiDV9FgGaa	If it is important to you that it not be orange-y, then GO TO A PROFESSIONAL.    You will NOT have good results at home. You can trust me, or find out for yourself.     Good Luck.|`|1b6gVIZ1aa	you should compare it to ur hair
LJJTK0XEaa	Your hair is growing now, why spend money on something you don't know will work or not? I have tried horse shampoo and if there was a differnce in how fast it grew I didnt notice it.   Besides that is like trying to make your finger nails grow faster. Let it grow on its own, be patient.|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	selsun blue,head and shouders and there is horse shampoo and it also makes it grow fatser|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	There is no such shampoo, and if they claim to make your hair grow faster, it's a scam! Don't fall for it!    You can, however, control the health of your hair. Start taking multi-vitamins and take a lot of B vitamins.    Hope this helps!|`|Bfs8j22Yaa	Any that contain biotin. I don't know if it works, but that's what I heard.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	I know Biotin helps my hair get thicker but it doesnt make it grow
oQoVehifaa	One with a corset style bust and a gathered skirt with many layers. Of course it should also have details such as embroidery, pearls and lace is your going for a victorian/modern look. But make sure you're comfortable wearing it though!|`|E76or3sYaa	Maybe try :::  Like a corset dress. You get ? Umm....But the dress doesn't go all thw wayy down to your ankles. It goes just past your knees. It's formal.  And it is tight all the wayy. It's like a ''Figure-Dress''  And do your hair in a very Victorian wayy. Wear Pearl Necklaces and put on Red lipstick. That'll look pretty Victorian, I guess.    Maybe sure you catwalk, because if you walk clumsy, you'll spoil the look of the dress and it looks better.    GoodLuck~    x|`|v0owu3cBaa	Here's a victorian wedding dress. Personally I didn't like it very much but it suits the theme:    http://www.haberdasheryboutique.com/imag...

AA11320586	Do not do anything coz you're beautiful.|`|KtwwNy19aa	If you have dark brown eyes and dark black hair, I would say go with a Hazel brown color, because I have hazel brown contacts and dark brown eyes and they make my eyes look dark green. We are about the same from what you described. But if you feel that green is best for you, go with dark green...|`|TxJsq6ecaa	goo with a very light shade of green!    almost a lime green.    it will look amazing|`|kPR6Ggl3aa	a baby crystal blue..trust me i have blue eyes and clored my hari dark and its gorgeous.. made em pop!!!|`|pw8FX7ANaa	light green either that or light bluish gray|`|7xkwE3X9aa	I think both are pretty, it also depends on the person.  You could always get both!  I have dyed black hair and green eyes, but I have to hide them behind glasses, b/c my dad won't let me get contacts.  I say go with green but I'm biased!|`|NUBxWvExaa	definately green cos i have same hair n skin color too.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Maybe blue eyes. Kind of like a Siberian Husky's.|`|iy35M3BGaa	I would say Gray or Dark Green.
7Pvr6qBAaa	Take a strand of hair out of your head and put it into a glass of water. If it sinks, your hair is dry (because the hair is sinking in order to get moisture from the water.)  Take another strand of hair out of your head and pull slowly on it. If it just breaks right away without stretching at all, then it is dry.|`|rH8IEeOlaa	if its not wet its dry|`|PDJbNAZqaa	When your hair feels "rough".|`|5j0NgLDmaa	If you can go for two or three days without washing your hair and it still doesn't look greasy, then it's dry.|`|AA11901859	You have dry hair if it seems to be getting a little frizzy, poofy or fly-away, and a little test that can see how damaged is to rip out a single hair, twist it around your fingers, and see if it stretches any.  If it breaks right away, then your hair is dry or damaged|`|70rn5bdAaa	you would know if your hair was dry because it would have many split ends and would feel gross.  Dove therapy system is really good|`|jbZkB1L6aa	if its not soft, it is dry. if your ends are brittle to the touch (break off), then its dry. i wouldnt use mane n tale. ever. and stay away from pantene. it contains many waxes that build up in your hair follicles. try using garnier fructisse. it works wonders for me.|`|sGPU25Gtaa	You know if your hair is dry if it is frizzy and brittle. It will also probably feel tangly.

zRjU9uvIaa	Ebay. If you go to a secondhand store, they only give you around a third of what they will resell your items for, if that.

Has someone recently knocked your confidence?|`|xGmhDTWwaa	whenever you feel pretty, remember what you see in the mirror and you'll be fine. It's probably the constant barrage of "fake" and "perfect" images all around us all the time. You are pretty, you just compare yourself to others and worked on images which is unrealistic.<br>  <br>  Keep a compact in your pocket ;o) haha<br>  <br>  xx|`|Vk6C4ICLaa	well its good that when you see yourself in the mirror you like what you see.<br>  <br>  so i guess you sorta have a low selfesteem, but with a little reminding now and then you could get over it in a bit.|`|TYnU6muyaa	you are a woman so by nature you think you are ugly and are looking for attention|`|4bH6L9JSaa	Look at my latest question please. Your not the only one.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	Want some cheese with that whine?|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Lol don't worry you're not insane I went through a phase like that. Just reming yourself everytime you feel ugly of your reflection in the mirror. That's how people see you. So even if you FEEL ugly people see what YOU see when you look in the mirror. Nothing to worry about everybody has their insecurities. I'm sure all the celebrities have gone through the same thing. It's emotional not physical.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	Ya, you seem to have really low self-esteem, but just asking....do you whine like this around everyone at school and stuff???? People tend to drift away from people like that. Maybe that's why you don't feel "pretty". Try to have a happier outlook on life overall! :) People will want to be around you more! ;)|`|OUBKWrf2aa	Maybe u R really ugly and just have to accept the truth<br>  <br>  Can u handle the truth??|`|KVzBqWhvaa	It's all in your head.
cN7eh7Tbaa	It really depends on what your face looks like! you should post a pic of your fast so we can know. but personally, if i were to choose sunglasses, i would choose either the first one you wanted, or the second. But they all are GORGEOUS! hope i helped! :)|`|Qxmpn9Gtaa	I like the all black one the best :)<br>  the all black and white ones are cute too and the brownish one is just ugly<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|BhEVhdvDaa	I'd say the brownish ones or the all black ones. The two tone ones are ugly I think.|`|jgti45eGaa	One hundred dollars for a pair of sunglasses? Get yourself together child. You could get so much more for 100$ and they aren't even brand name or that nice. <br>  <br>  I suppose if I had to choose it would be black, but that matches with everything .|`|J53Uj6Ubaa	The all black ones!!!
