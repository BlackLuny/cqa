I'm considering getting it layered to compliment my high cheekbones, but I want some oppinions from someone that would know which styles would look best on my face type. Thanks for your suggestions.

It's not! So basically, 3/4 of my hair is dyed. I figure I have 2 options, please advise:      1. Buy another box of haircolor and try to cover up the parts that didn't get colored last night.   (This makes me worry that I will miss something)      2. Buy 2 more boxes and do it all over again as if last night didn't happen.

My father has the pits all over his face from acne, as does my older sister.   My mother has Roascia (sp?) and bad acne too.   Both of my parents are over 50, and still suffer from acne.   I myself have developed severly oily skin within the last year and my acne has worsened.      A few things about me:   - I am a vegetarian, and have cleaned up my diet to free it from oils and such things that may cause breakouts or worsen my oily skin.   - I get large, deep, painful pimples.. sometimes 2 -3 at one time on my face.   - I also have acne all over my back, shoulders, and even my neck.       What should I do to rid myself, and maybe control the oil and acne?   Any suggestions of acne clearing brands or oil reducers?   Within one school day I would say that I use 1 - 2 oil blotting sheets completely.. it's that bad.   And don't say use proactive or anything like that.   I've tried it.   Multiple times.   It has never worked.      Helppp? Thanks.

I went to the salon and got side bangs but they're super flingy and they don't stay and I think it's because of my new shampoo; Herbal essences. It was called, "extremly straight". It's for people who want straight hair and I thought this could work! So everytime I use it, my hair turns into this curly mess and now I try to put it up in a ponytail but the bangs come back and they're flingy. Any advice? I really like my hair straight but if I use a straightening iron i don't want to ruin my hair. and the beauician straightened it and it was beautiful and i feel in love with it and i wanted it everyday. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!! my hairs in a bun now

Cos i used to be really confident and think i was the most beautiful girl and all these boys liked me i got so much attention from them and boys were always askin my older brother if they could go out with me (he said no lol). now i think im kinda ugly and i dont really look pretty and boys are just my friends. also i used to get complimented like every day i was really pretty. so do you think confident ppl automatically seem prettier?
20090220094157AAaIjA6	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Should i be a tattoo artist or go to collage?	I have been incressingly interested in tattooing for a few years now. i have been so interested that i now go to an art impact high school. i am taking every art class that the school has to offer i have now been advanced to advanced palcement for my art abbilitys. the problem is my parents have a diffrent gole in mind for me. Ever scince i got my first tattoo i have been mesmerized. tattooing is alot harder than i thought it was, you have to go through almost 4 years of "apprenticeship" then after that happens you have to find someone who had an oppening in there shop and thinks you good enough and as soon as you start tattooing you still dont get all the money. so i quess the question im boiling down to is this: Do i follow what my parents want for me (to go to collage and get my degree.) or do i follow my dream and become the tattoo artist i have always wanted to be?

20090220082730AAZXDta	Beauty & Style;Hair	Bleached hair and its now yellow ?	I went to a hair salon a few days before last Christmas and had my dark brown hair bleached and it turned an ugly yellow color and the ends had and have a light tint of orange to them, But towards the root there are a few parts that are white but only noticable when looking close-up, So then a few days after Christams I went back to the salon and told them I was not satisfied with the results and they said they would fix it for me, ( I wanted it to be white blonde all around my whole head ) So the stylist did a few things which im not sure of but it wasnt the same process as the 1st exactly,   But anyways after she was done I looked in the mirror and my hair looked exactly the same as it did when I walked in the place, A disgusting yellow color with orange ends.   So she sold me some of that Blue shampoo and Conditioner stuff which ive been using ever since the end of December and I dont see any improvements.       Is there anything out there that can turn my hair White Blonde ???   Any help/Advice is appreciated :)

There's a really fake girl at school: she's bleach blonde (her brown roots show), has a belly button ring, and wears tight and short outfits. But, she does seem nice. The HUGE problem is, all of the boys like her! I mean, I haven't heard one boy say "She's hot!" or "Whew, check her out!". Personally, it makes me sick. Guys, tell me...   Why do boys like girls like that?   What's attractive about her?   What's wrong with the girls who are themselves?
