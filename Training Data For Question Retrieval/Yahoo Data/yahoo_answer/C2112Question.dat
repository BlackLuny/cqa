20090307165153AA4gMNx	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;User Profiles	Can someone please edit my essay?	Our collective well being is improved if we live in a peaceful, flourishing, supportive society, so promoting well being should be a public as well as a personal task. Well being is more than just happiness. It is about having meaning in our lives, developing as a person and feeling that our lives are fulfilling and worthwhile. Well being comes from having a web of relationships and interests. Family and friends, agencies and communities all can increase our well being. Our relationships also provide for our most basic human needs. While helping us to have a fulfilling life, our relationships help us to live our lives to the fullest potential. Through our relationships, we are sustained in our personal growth and development. Our relationships are the substance to how each of us grow and interact with each other. The relationship substance strengthens our bonds and builds trust. As we grow, we learn from life experiences after leaving our parents.          Re-enforcement of values is what makes us who we are as individuals. For example, support and confidence from others helps to mold us into being a positive part of society. What makes individuals who they are is contributed by everyone who has helped and guided that person. Relationships play a central role throughout our lives although the family structure may maybe different for every individual. Whether our family structure is composed of one or both parents, or other family members, strong support from others is important for that individuals’ well-being.          But just as human relationships with others and our family is essential for our well being so is trust.  Trust impact everyone. It affects the quality of every relationship, every communication, and every effort in which we are engaged. The ability to establish, grow, extend and restore trust is not only vital to our personal and interpersonal well being but for the community as well. I believe that within each of every individual is the ability to reach our full potential and change the world, one person at a time. We must start with ourselves. We seek to act with integrity in our own lives, fostering trust in our relationships with family, clients, and community. As people’s lives become more purposeful, fulfilled and happy, so this makes a positive change in how they interact with those around them, and these in turn affect others. As a result of this, one person living their life in accordance with who they really are can, in a sense, bring positive change to the world. Each and every one of us can come to realize that he or she, no matter how insignificant or helpless he may feel-is in a position to change the world. We must all begin with ourselves; if we wait for someone else, none of us will ever see any change. And it is not true that it is impossible: even the most powerless among us has his own willpower, and at the same time this is perhaps the only thing that no one can take away from us. Whoever applies it may achieve something. So, I want to as a person who is concerned about the well being of others to give them a ray of hope. I want to give individuals that are marginalized and vulnerable hope that they can accomplish things.          No matter where people live, work, or get there education, there is going to be diverse individuals everywhere. For myself, diversity simply is living in a community where nothing is alike. We all want the same things for every individual. The dignity of all human beings, and treating all people with respect and equality and people having the opportunity to fully participate in becoming self-sufficient to make the best possible choices for themselves. We would accept nothing less from each of us. We recognize the differences among us. We all recognize that each of us have different ideas, views, and perspectives when working together to solve problems. All individuals need to come together to appreciate our differences and understand where people come from and why they believe as they do. When people look at diversity, we must look beyond our own culture and race. People should take a broader view of things that make up the whole person and what makes us all unique. Overall, diversity celebrates what makes us unique, and it is important to me because individuals can never stop learning new things about it through other people.          For myself, I know that I was able to learn from other cultures and have an open mind when our views differed from one another. For example, I am an individual of mixed heritage. I am African American and Mexican American. My mother is Mexican and my family is African American. I grew up in a small community in Southern Texas mostly which the population was Spanish. I was raised by my mother who taught me how to speak Spanish. I eventually learned how to speak both English and Spanish. This a part of my heritage that is important to me that I am bilingual.          I generally learned to speak Spanish because, while my mot

So my boyfriend was like "when I say 'GO' you push off with your feet okay?" So I did, and as I pushed off, he pushed me at the same time, and I flew off the board, landing on my butt as it dragged across the sand, and I sat there trying to get up as each wave knocked me over, and I saw my boyfriend running up to me and the first thing he does is reach for my top; then I realized that I was sitting there topless for a good amount of time and EVERYONE saw.      :X
20090307172703AAvdTxd	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	How to deal with someone who appears to be taking over in a yahoo group?	how would you handle this? If you are a owner of a group and you have a moderator of the group who appears to be taking over the yahoo group IE: contantly says hello to all the new members of the group even though they have not said anything.It is not just a hello it is a very long intro again from this moderator who keeps asking people who joined questions as well as saying hello.The moderator is also emailing some of the members offlist to say hello again. i have become aware of this due to some members asking me why does this person do this. i cant answer for them, suggested  maybe not emailing anyone offlist unless they request. the group is a support group. Some of the members have said this moderator has come on far to strong and they do not wish to particepate anymore.the members have not spoken to this particular moderator.some of the members of this group know this moderator outside of the yahoo group so the owner my sister doesnt feel she should ban the moderator and is not able to discuss things that have occured as the moderator belives they are right and they have done nothing at all wrong. should my sister just hand over controls to this moderator and just start again? her view is life is far to short to argue over petty things however she does not want to put up with this persons lack of consideration or respect. any suggestions. Thanks sorry it is so long winded

20090307200844AAboFyu	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What does Yahoo! Answers Teams means by this ? :?	So, I always asked questions at Yahoo! Answers Community and I will always receive new answers by email from Yahoo! Answers.      But, whenever my questions is getting close to the expiration date, Yahoo will send me an email again and again saying about :      Hey, Desperate H, don't hit that snooze button too many times      You question may expire in 48 hours      We know, time flies.So we wanted to give you this heads up So, what now? If you want more answers, you can extend the deadline.Just click on the question above then breathe new life into it using the Action Bar to extend it for another 4 days      It sounds like Yahoo! Answer is mad and being rough to their user by saying "Hey, Desperate H, don't hit that snooze button too many times" (=.=") . Maybe users will feel distracted or something with that "Hey," blahblahblah. I guess it will be more comforting if they put any smiley icon after they're telling users to not to hit that snooze button too many times don't you think so?      So, my point is :      What does it means by don't hit that snooze button too many times? Which snooze button is they talkin about??       What is Action Bar??      Do 'Deadline' they're talking about is about the expiration date of a question?      That's all.Thanks in advance :)
