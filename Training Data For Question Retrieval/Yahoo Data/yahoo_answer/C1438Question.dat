20090131173013AA52EvJ	Social Science;Sociology	Men, what is going on here?	I noticed something else about a male friends behaviour. If I dress up for work, he acts like he doesn't even see me. I mean he completely ignores me and then if I say hello, he acts like..'oh hi, I didn't see you there' or like I'm just something he hardly noticed at all. Like I am nothing. BUT if I am dressed casually, he smiles and me and makes an effort to say hello. Why is that? Is he afraid that I am dressing up to impress him? But if that's the case, then why bother being friendly the next day? And if he just wants friendship, then why not just be consistent and say hello the whole time, or not at all? In the past he said he wanted me etc, but I turned him down often cause he surrounds himself with women and I didn't want to be just another one. I mean he is totally confident with far better looking women than me and is known as a flirt.   The other day he acted like he didnt see me in the office, but I caught him looking me up and down when he thought I wasn't looking. Then he started singing really loudly and whistling to himself as he left and You could hear him singing really loudly outside the door.
20090131173934AAdbxvr	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Help With Dream Interpretation?	Last night I went to bed and had a weird, scary dream. I was walking to school, the streets were made out of bricks. All of the sudden, I saw a HUGE mechanical arm touching the sun, the flames in the sun slowly faded and the only thing left was a big black rock where the sun was as if the sun turned off. After that many meteors started to appear in the sky, Blue, Pink and Red. The had such grace when moving in circles. After that there were at least five airplanes dropping gun powder all over town. After that happen an airplane dropped a live human that made the powder detonate not into fire but an explosions of greek letters that at the end touched me and killed me. The whole time I was praying my death would not be painful.      Please, give me any suggestion of what it might mean of explanations of small portions.      Thank you s much!

I hate him, he really couldn't be a worse parent, well if he hit me it would be worse but then I would be able to have him removed from my life. Anyways, I am ashamed to be related to a person like him. All I have wanted for the past 4 years was to have a normal family and a normal house. I now see that this is now out of the question and I need to move on with my life and leave them behind me (my mom and brother too). I hate him but the problems with hating him is that it hurts me worse then it will ever hurt him. It will only keep me a victim in this situation, as long as their actions influence my emotions then they are still controlling and hurting me. I don't want to live as a victim anymore. I need to know how to make it so their bad behavior is not going to determine who I am or how I feel. I need to make my own reputation and decide I am not going to be like them, and not going to let them ruin who I am. How do I just stop hating him and cut off all emotions from him? Oh and I am 17 years old and counting down the days till I leave for college in late August.

20090131185221AADbbWz	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are women more selfish than men?	* In elementary school, boys & girls often trade gifts on Valentine's Day. In adolescence & adulthood, Valentine's Day then becomes about "what can the man get for the woman" and what women can expect to get out of men. Often, men either do not get gifts, or at best get something lame like a kiss on the forehead. I even consider sex a lame gift since he's getting that from her anyway.      * Men will spend money on women for dates, gifts, the roof over her head, his car/transporation. And women expect this. Women generally do not pay for dates or gifts for men, even if she makes just as much money or more than him. Many women are parasites on men, but rarely will a man be a parasite on women      * Women almost always win custody of the child, even if the mother is unfit to parent and the father wants the child more.      * Men are always complimenting women on how they look/dress. Women generally do not compliment men on how they look/dress and instead expect to receive compliments from men.      * Many men participate in fundraising for women's health issues like breast & ovarian cancer. Most women do not care about men's health issues like prostate cancer.      * Men hold open doors and chairs for women. Women generally do not hold doors open and at times let the door slam in men's faces (I've witnessed it).      * If a man is interested in a woman, he "makes the first move" and let's her know that he likes her. If a woman is interested in a man, she will not make the first move. Instead, she will pretend she's not interested in him, and manipulate & play games by "dropping hints" instead of being straight-forward. The women like knowing they're "attractive", and a man approaching her gives her confirmation. However, men also like feeling attractive to a woman, yet, rarely does he get confirmation since even if a woman is attracted to him, she will not show it and still expect him to show his attraction to her.      * Women are always telling men to get in touch with their "emotions", but men are not allowed to tell women to get in touch with logic & reason.      * Men on the Titanic sacrificed their lives so women could live. Not only would women never do this for men, but women actually have crafted a "list of why women are better than men" on the internet, with one of the mentions bragging about how women got off the Titanic first. Yeah, but it was men that allowed for this to happen. Doesn't make sense to poke fun at the same gender for not having a certain privilege, when that same gender sacrificed themselves to give women that privilege in the first place.         I don't think women are inherently more selfish than men. Meaning, I don't think females are born with a "selfish gene" or anything of the sort. I believe selfishness is socialized in women. When males & females are born, neither male nor female is more or less selfish than the other. But, as time progresses, boys are generally raised to fend for themselves and "tough it out" through hard times, while girls are given everything on a silver platter. And this continues on in to adolescence and adulthood.

20090131184343AAt2Bd6	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Repeal of the Global Gag Rule - reproductive health services more available: A solution to global poverty?	And by addressing global poverty with these measures of making the provision of reproductive health services more available in third world countries, can the need for foreign aid funding be reduced over time?  --------------------------------------...  Feminist Daily News Wire  January 23, 2009    Victory for Women! Global Gag Rule Repealed    The Feminist Majority applauds President Barack Obama for issuing an executive order today that repeals the Global Gag Rule. President Obama's expeditious action on behalf of women worldwide will save the lives, health, and suffering of literally millions of women worldwide yearly.    "Barack Obama, with the stroke of a pen, is now saving the lives and health of countless women and girls around the world. President Obama is keeping his pledge to women and I believe this is only the beginning," said Feminist Majority President Eleanor Smeal.    The Global Gag Rule prohibited family planning programs in other nations that receive US aid from using non-US monies for abortion counseling, advocacy, and referrals. The rule was instituted by President Reagan in 1984, was repealed by President Clinton, and was reinstituted by President George W. Bush.    The Global Gag Rule inhibited women worldwide from access to gynecological exams, AIDS prevention and treatment, and contraceptive options. It also halted shipment of condoms and contraceptives to more than 20 countries. In part because of restricted access to reproductive health services, more than 70,000 women annually die from unsafe abortions worldwide.   --------------------------------------...

20090131191538AA7IfMK	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	In this modern age, is patriarchal religion or matriarchal media/popular culture more influential?	Religions like Islam and Christianity teach it's followers that women's bodies are "shameful" and "tempting", but how many of their adherents actually believe it? I think in this modern age women are more afraid of their own bodies. Media/popular culture is the new "religion" now, and this religion makes women fearful of their own bodies. Women harshly criticize their own bodies and other women's bodies, far more than men do.      At least in the West, is patriarchal religion more influential or has it been replaced by matriarchal media/popular culture? Women are the main consumers in society and women make 80% of the spending decisions, so the media/popular culture markets predominantly to women. Patriarchal religion was marketed to men and men made most of the decisions. Both religion and media/popular culture dictates how people should think, live and behave. I think the two are similar.      What do you think?

20090131163658AANUS5q	Social Science;Economics	How will the world adjust to increasing specialization?	With the information age, and the boom of engineering, the advancement of technology, and the increasing developments and thought in every field, it is a certainty that  specialization must continue to become only more and more diversified.      What will be the effects of this?  Clearly, the world is and must continue to become more complicated as progress is achieved.      To me, this means that general understanding of fields outside one's own must decrease, and this will reflect especially with less efficiency in management.  Also, it seems like the time to learn about a particular occupation before making an advancement will continue to increase.  Both of these would lead me to expect that most advancements would be coming from large bureaucracies (as we are beginning to see), but also that the rate of advancement will decrease.      Assume other factors remain the same (such as education), what do you think will result in increasing specialization?

20090131181701AA97UV9	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why are less men in Gens X & Y getting university degrees than women?	The opportunity for tertiary education is equally available to the genders. But if more women than men become qualified to be the knowledge professionals and leaders in future society, then what can be done to encourage boys/men to commit to tertiary education so they can maintain equal representation in the professions? Will we lose our gender bias and get used to the idea that stay-at-home-fathers can also become a social norm?   --------------------------------------...      From AAP News: Jan 29 2009      Australian women are getting smarter all the time, or at least better educated, a new snapshot of the nation reveals.      An analysis of the 2006 census, released on Thursday, shows a higher proportion of women in each generation obtain a post-school qualification.      In 2006, men and women in generation X and Y were equally likely to have a qualification, with 57 per cent of men and 56 per cent of women completing some form of post-school study.      Generation X and Y includes people aged between 20 and 39 in 2006.      In contrast, in the oldest generation (people aged over 80 in 2006) 39 per cent of men had a qualification compared to just 14 per cent of women.      But when it comes to obtaining a university degree, the news is even better for the post-feminist revolution generation.      They have caught the men and surpassed them.      In 2006, more women (28 per cent of the total female population) than men (21 per cent) held a bachelor degree or above within generation X and Y.      Older women are also closing the gap by completing degrees as mature age students at higher rates than their male counterparts.   --------------------------------------...

20090131183624AAirV1f	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Recurring dream of a house with spare rooms which I am scared to go into?	Since I was a child I've had this recurring dream of secret attic rooms in a house that I would enter and hide in, sometimes alone sometimes with others.  The house and its layout didn't change for about 15 years, then a few years ago when I was in my late 20's I moved house in my dream.  Since then (so for about the last 5 years) I dream about the new house at least once a week that I am aware of.  The rooms in this house are situated on the 2nd storey of the house, with stair cases at either end of the house.  I only use the rooms that are situated above the middle floor and below the middle floor for living in.  I am aware in this dream that even though my children and I all have our own bedrooms, that really I could do with using these spare 2nd floor rooms, especially since they are both double size rooms.  The problem is whenever I enter them I become nervous, for some reason these rooms feel evil.  I check on a regular basis in case I was mistaken about these rooms being evil but no matter how confident I am feeling, as soon as I get onto the 2nd floor I am filled with trepidation and am genuinely scared of the atmosphere as soon as i  enter the rooms.   Even talking about entering this floor or the rooms when im awake, causes my heart to start racing and I feel panicky.   Whats this all about?????

20090226074118AA3VBhG	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Please help feeling trend confused?	i grew up in a suburban town that i never really liked. i spent most of my HS life a bit of a loner. senior year i finally found two friends that i thought were like the coolest people on earth. they seemed so politically and culturally savvy, and actually behaved like people who had ideas and concerns. fittingly i met them in AP digital art.  we were considered the 'art chicks'. since i respected them so much, i learned that there were parts of pop culture and fashion that i was not intuned with. i unknowingly became a hipster. i really DO think the fashion is beautiful. it inspires my art work, but i'm noticing problems with this whole lifestyle. my friends  both sometimes act like elitist snobs who put so much effort into being hip just because they have the time an leisure to do so. one doesn't have a job and her mom mom funds her perfect hipster wardrobe. she looks down on people who don't quite hit the mark. i really don't like this and hope that people won't think IM this way just because i'm into the hipster look. i don't know, all the sudden i feel like i walked into a trend without knowing enough about it. but i really AM a coffee house chick with political concerns who loves art. i don't know, i don't want to attract the wrong people and scare away others who may think i look intimidating. unlike my friends, i like anyone who is nice.

So there were these people, the straight people who didn't like them, police officers even who would beat them. killed some of them, for no reason at all really. so.. obviously this is related. but do you think that my dream might be telling me that i'm homophobic? because i don't know why i was running away. i thought they were going to kill me.

Warning, you may be disgusted by this story.      Octuplets Shown For First Time       View Slideshow   Nadya Suleman shows off her octuplets to the world.   Celebrities in the Surf       View Slideshow   Check out the goods (and not so goods) these celebs have when they are stripped down to their swimsuits.   Nadya "OctoMom" Suleman has been offered $1 million to make a pornographic movie by Vivid Entertainment.      The deal also includes health insurance for Suleman's swollen family.      "Nadya obviously needs income to assure that her children are secure so we are offering her up to $1 million to act in one movie," said Steven Hirsch, co-chairman of Vivid. "We've had many single mothers work with us over the years and their income from Vivid has been very helpful to them. We would schedule production so that the movie could be shot in less than a week."      A Vivid spokesman said they hope she receives the offer in the mail today.      The story was first reported on TMZ.com, where they had a copy of the letter Vivid sent to Suleman.      In the letter, Hirsch points out that OctoMom would join the Vivid-Celeb imprint line, which has featured stars such as Pam Anderson, Kim Kardashian and former Miss USA and NBC daytime star Kelly McCarty.      Suleman's octuplets, born on Jan 26. boosted her brood to 14, as she had six children already.      In case anyone was thinking that someone with that many children wouldn't make a good porn star, keep in mind her numerous kids were all fathered through artificial insemination and delivered through C-section. We're just saying.      if she takes this deal is she actually admitting that she can't afford to raise the children.      The whole purpose is to have mone for the kids, so taking the deal might not be such a bad idea.      What do you guys think???

20090131183320AAzAd0E	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can I get someones opinion on this dream?	Okay here's a little background: I'm 18, and just moved 500 miles from Ohio, where everything I knew existed, to North Carolina to be with the guy I'm in love with. The winter when I was 16 I found out there was a good chance I couldn't bear children, and I love kids with all my heart. Before I moved I didn't get the chance to see too many of my family to say goodbye because I had been planning to come back for Christmas and such. Well that went down the drain when my car broke down, so my return trip is in March. Since then, my grandma has moved houses and lives near a place I used to live with my mom when I was younger. So, with all of that, since I think it might have to do with some of it, here's the dream:  I was living with my mother and my grandmother in this two story house, with a tiny backyard.  I had a daughter who was absolutely adorable, couldn't have been very old, maybe 2 months? She had strikingly black hair and amazing eyes, either gray or purple in color. She had to have been premature because she was tiny. (Here's the weird part) I could put her in a bowl of water that would send her to this other world where she could run and race with other tiny babies and I could look in and see her racing and such and whenever I pulled her out she'd be normal size again (well, still tiny for a baby though.) And at one point, I kept dipping her in the water, thinking she wanted to race again, but there was no reaction so I looked at her and she was asleep. So I kissed the top of her head and then started wondering what her name was. Yeah, I couldn't remember her legal name because I called her all sorts of different things: Mai, Alexandra, Rayven, Champagne, Morgan, Savannah... So on and so forth. So it was bothering me really bad that I couldn't remember my daughters name.  I searched the house up and down looking for her birth certificate but couldn't find it. I went and asked my mother, who was doing taxes. She said she couldn't remember either and shuffled through a few of her own papers, then said she had no idea where the certificate was either.  I went for a walk around the neighborhood, trying to clear my mind, but there was a lot of construction and I couldn't possibly think straight. I decided to go ask my grandmother because honestly, grandmas should know just about everything. I was walking behind houses, trying to avoid the construction and there was one guy who was spraying tar through a hose, onto the roofs of houses. I had to be careful because sometimes he'd miss and tar would spray between the houses into the backyards and stick to the grass. I watched him for a moment then jumped into my backyard just as my grandma was walking out of the back door in a white towel.  She was headed towards the clothes line to get dressed and there was a dog in the back, taking up the tiny amount of yard we had, turning all the grass to dirt. I remember the dog barking but not much else, maybe a semi-friendly rottweiler? Maybe it was gray or black? It was medium sized, I know that much.  Anyway, I ask my grandmother about my daughters name and she says she doesn't know, and takes off the towel, (Nothing was revealed). Her chest was extremely hairy, so you could not see her breasts and she put a bra and shirt on and then I noticed the bottom half of her was a tree trunk. (Weird, right?) Anyway, I asked if I should go to the hospital, to see if they still had a copy on file and she said no because they would just look for twenty seconds while I stood there and as soon as I left they'd give up.  After that, I pulled myself out of the dream, because I was starting to worry myself in real life.  It was sort of a lucid dream because I could make myself search for different names I had called her.  And out of all of the weirdness the thing that bothered me the most was the fact that I couldn't remember my daughters name.    Any suggestions or ideas? This dream has been bugging me for days. And I apologize for the length, but I tried adding as much detail as I remember.  Thanks ahead of time. =)

Then I helped him up and told him I was so glad he saved us, Then I kissed him twice, and this blonde woman that looked about in her thirtys gave me a dirty look. Then after that we went back to camp, and had like a christmas party, and I got two feather bed pads, and a thing for a baby crib that was reversible. One side had flowers like my niece's, and the other side had the pink dog from blues clues on it. Then my grandpa I call papa made my smell it, and asked if it smell filmiliar, then me and the guy I like were talking to my grandpa, and he asked if we completed our mission. Then the guy I like said "no but we were close to that net I could feel it!" Then I woke up.      What do you think this dream means?

If you were religious, would you look for an answer that is based on your belief of existence of a higher being before you even start?  And if you were a non-believer, could this too misconstrue your choice of paths and views?
20090131183729AASe6Gz	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have the right to feel depressed about this?	My birthday was yesterday. My friends birthday was 2 weeks ago. My other feriends threw her a surprise party today, and didn't even invite me, or call me to wish me a happy birthday or anything. I got a few facebook messages, but that's not even special. I give soo ******* much to make them happy, and they don't even seem to care about me.    Do I have the right to be depressed?   Im actually bauling my eyes out right now.   I just turned 16.    I feel no one loves me, except my family.    I have no best friends, my true best friend doesn't want to be my friend anymore. I have trouble making friends, but when I do, I get close and im nice and giving, and goofy.   getting off topic.      Do I have the right to feel upset by this, or am I over reacting.

20090131183717AA4mjMo	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone help me decode this dream?	My friend had a dream that involved me A LOT and she wants to know what it means... I want to know what it means. :P   So this is how it goes :      She saw a plane crash and ran to the ruins. When she got there, all she saw was dead bodies. NO ONE had any bruises though. They just all layed there dead. She looked and in the middle of all the dead bodies there was a house. She ran into the house and she saw me.  I rushed her into my room and told her to hide.  My mother was a robot and very mean and kept me locked in this room.  I was trying to escape.  She asked to go out of one of the windows and I told her no.  That the particular window she wanted to go out of was being watched by out neighbor.  We escaped out of the other window, ran past the bodies and were suddenly in a canoe.  We were surrounded by other people in canoes trying to get away from where we had been.  Then, the dream ended.       REMEMBER, this was NOT my dream.   But she felt it had something to do with me, since the dream revolved around me. "/      Can SOMEONE PLEASE tell me a little something that can help me understand what it means?      Plz&&Thankyou. ;)      && answers some of my other questions! :)

I've been reading CardCaptor Sakura stuff on fanfiction.net, which is a site full of stories about different stuff. I used to be obsessed with CardCaptor Sakura and I was determined to have it continued. Then I stumbled onto the site and I was hooked. It became my new therapy and obsession. I thought it was good for me because I'm very close to competing in the Nat.

I still have CardCaptor Sakura in my heart, but the reading is driving my parents crazy. How do I get rid of a reading obsession?

I don't drink that often, probably once a week.But when I do go out with my friends to the bar I have so much fun that I lose track of how much I'm drinking until its too late and I end up blacking out. Recently I drank to much, and I only remember the night up until a certain point, but apparently I was up for hours after I blacked out, and I ended up making out and possibly having sex with a guy that we were all hanging out with. I felt horrible when I woke up the next day, because I had no idea that this happened. The guy told me that he was really drunk too and we just madeout, but then I found out that he told other people that we did a lot more than that. I think he remembers, and is just lying to me because I dont. I am so embarrased, and humiliated that I did this. I feel so alone and don't know what to do. All my friends do is drink so what am I supposed to do? Just not hang out with them anymore because I cant seem to control myself and make bad decisions? I'm just so very sad about how I acted and the fact that I was up doing things and I don't even remember. I need some advice....please help....

Well, my point is that I am quite aware that I am not the easiest person to be around at times. I tend to be very cynical and untrusting of others. I also have a hard time just being open to people. *Sighs*      I have a great desire to be friends outside of work with the woman I am working with. She is engaged to her boyfriend, which means to me that she must be a very likable person. At the same time I fear that if she were to get to know me that she may not like me because of all my flaws.      I am too shy and would never have enough confidence to ever tell her how I feel even though I want to be friends with her.      I just don't know what to do. I know that once she goes back to her branch I am going to miss her and it won't be easy for me to get over.      I don't share an emotionally close relationship with my own mother because of the way she treated me. I know that there is a huge void in my life and I don't want to spend the rest of it wishing for something to be.      I just don't know what to do. Can someone please help me? Thanks.

20090226080320AA0k4pl	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	I dreamt the other night that the garages and sheds in the back yard of my house were on fire.  This is quite an extensive amount of area to have been on fire.  In the dream I went down the yard and saw people being dragged out of the sheds in pyjamas as though they'd been sleeping in there but all the sheds in real life are full or car parts and mechanic type things.  In the dream I remember being calm to begin with and just ambling around the yard watching the place on fire.  Then I went back inside and looked out towards the fire and saw more people in pyjamas coming out of the sheds.  At this point I dialled 999 but got a weird juvenile kinda person who wouldn't put me through to the fire service.  I got really angry and cursed at him and he hung up then I ran upstairs to my parents room and woke them saying the back yard was on fire and they got up..  When we went outside again, a fire engine had appeared and was putting out the fire.  By day break, the fire was out and for some reason my friend's brother (who I realy like) was there and I joked about how his car had managed to be untouched in the fire as it was parked beside the sheds.  I can't remember anymore as I may have woken up at this point but I do know no one died.  I just really don't get the dream and also I've been having a LOT of weird dreams lately, all about different things and my friends brother features in a lot of them.

20090131165803AAF89jw	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you think of potential technologically induced gender changes?	What sorts of gender-related changes do you think the future will hold?      Right now, many biochemists and those in related fields are studying the human body.  It's likely that the definition of "human" will have to become more general at some future point to encompass a larger range of creatures, but for the more immediate future, I think gender changes will come about.  These changes can affect anything from just interaction in the bedroom to what a gender is.      Some of the ones I can think of:   -Simpler and more effective gender conversion.  (How will it change things about when people can change sexes fairly quickly and cheaply?  What about when they change to sexes that don't naturally occur?)   -Far more satisfying sex toys.  (Less sexual frustration- how would that change society?)  (Includes improved versions of porn, sex robots, etc.)   -DNA testing (as a previous question brought up, about paternity).   -Better cosmetics/appearance-altering methodologies.  (What happens when no one's "more beautiful", but people appear as they want to, making beauty entirely a matter of opinion?)   -Artificial wombs.  (What happens when child birth can occur without needing a partner, for both men and women and other gender?)      Just some random ideas off the top of my head (and all ones that seem plausible to me as a student of engineering and biochemistry), so I'm sure there are far more interesting ones I'm not even thinking of.      Has anyone given thought to what "sex" might mean in a hundred or so years?  If so, any interesting thoughts?      What even happens when there's no longer a clear line between "male" and "female"?

20090131201654AA6zsLn	Social Science;Other - Social Science	A boy in my class is constantly being teased...?	I am in high school. I have a class with a boy who people would call a "nerd". (I'll call him "Bill") Bill is a shy and very conscientious student that has a strange voice and doesn't have friends (however, he seems like he chooses to isolate himself from others. I have tried to have a conversation with him before, but he didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me). Anyhow, the other boys in my class make fun of him and tease him constantly. They chant his name and they will reach out to him for a high-five. The boys in my class falsely accuse him of things (such as cheating) and make him the root of all their jokes. Bill ignores them and tries to act not bothered, but I can see in his eyes that it really hurts and annoys him. My teacher watches this happen and does not seem to care that the boys are making fun of Bill. It really disturbs me how the boys in my class make fun of him this way and that the teacher lets it slide. I have the urge to stop all of this teasing, but I am shy and socially-anxious, so I can't bring myself to stand up for Bill. And I am afraid that even if I did stand up for Bill, no one would take me seriously and they would continue to tease him. Nevertheless, this situation bothers me and I am scared that it will lead Bill to a school shooting or suicide. Please give me advice, thank you.

20090131171946AAPOHX9	Social Science;Psychology	Is he completely over me or do we still have hope?	0k, i messed up, 2 weeks ago i dated this guy working in the same building, we really hit off and i was too scared to tell him about my bf, I didn't call him for the whole weekend by making some lame excuses, he called me up and i confessed that i have a live-in bf, i said that I will break up with my bf soon (its true!, i'm growing apart from my bf but have no heart to break up), the new guy said that he has been hurt many times and he was waiting for me to call over the weekend but i never did. we then chatted for ages, HOWEVER he never asked me out again, last time he called me my bf grabbed the phone and abused him. Now he completely stopped calling me or texting me. Do I still have any chance with this guy or should i just move on? I really like him and i am willing to dump my bf for him, but what if he doesn't wanna know me even after i break up with my bf? We work in the same building but he is now nowhere to be seen at lunch time
20090131170633AAlwS6o	Social Science;Psychology	I feel like I am a Treecko Pokemon... and a real Pokemon Trainer. How do I cope with this?	I mean, I KNOW that Pokemon can't be real... but at the same time, I think they are. I feel like I am a Treecko, and that one day I'll be one in the Pokemnon World, and one day I'll be an actual human Trainer, either before or after I live a Treecko life (both after this one, and keeping all my memories from all three lives).

20090226080551AAmvcKC	Social Science;Psychology	You ever had those moments where you figured out you were wrong?	How did you know?      So here we go trying to think again. What motivation this time I wonder. I'm just kidding, it sure seems like that is the case sometimes.      I think of the things I think I want or need, and the things that I have to have for survival. In making my life decisions, there must be a point where I can start recognizing why I made a certain choice and what desire did it fulfill. Especially if it ever involves someone else. It's obviously a respect thing. Can I follow the path of least resistance if my own doubts are what have been haunting me and preventing me from wanting to contribute?      Maybe it's trying to see a big picture. Everyone has their own ideas and we all have had different backgrounds. Sometimes I wonder if everyone is willing to meet in the middle. Do I need confirmation from everyone to begin living? It makes me think of asking "is the world safe". Is it fair for me to answer or comment? What if I was wrong? What if I was wrong even asking this question? Makes me think for a minute about some times I knew I was wrong.      What if people blamed me for something I never knew emotionally affected them? How was I suppose to know what their reaction would be? It gets back to you in one way or another it seems. Will that person become dependant on me to make them happy again? To undo a wrong or can they just let go and make the best out of it? Should I feel obligated? Is it a dependency issue?      I know there are lot's of questions. My daughter is about to lose a tooth and I feel reluctant about claiming the Tooth Fairy is visiting knowing that it is a lie.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f38Ne96R3...
