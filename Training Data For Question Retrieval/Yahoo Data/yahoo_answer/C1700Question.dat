I can only assume if certain people are offended by this doll then they might as well ban all dolls that are of a different colour other than white!  How ridiculous and damaging this PC lark has gone. I cannot see anything wrong with this doll or any other for that matter. It is not as if they are promoting the golliwog in chains etc referring to the appalling slave trade of days gone by.........this is an innocent doll, with no reference to people in my opinion.  Some PC extremists a fuelling the flames of hatred and racism by banning this, instead of treating this doll like any other.  If we are to look at other dolls ........say for instance......action man, all muscles and powerful (an imaginary stereotype if every I saw one)......do we see small, weedy men with no muscles standing up and saying this is a slur on their manhood and their looks?  I'm afraid the only association I see when I look at the golliwog is Robertson's jam and nothing more.  It seems that there are people out there who have nothing better to do than try and incite racism, and hatred among the people of the world.  Yes folks we are all living on the same planet, drinking the same water, and living more or less the same........why on earth we cannot live in harmony never fails to shock and disappoint me totally.

I listened to it myself, you could hear just about anything in those sounds.      What on earth is wrong with that statement anyway? If the baby on my kid's DS appeared to say "Burn things" or "Kill. Kill. Kill", I might be concerned (after I ruled out the possibility of paranoia or auditory hallucinations). But, "Islam is the light"?

Most parents would willingly do it for their children...but this is the ultimate sacrifice for a 13year old girl...       BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A 13-year-old Chinese girl tried to commit suicide because she wanted her family to donate her liver to her cancer-stricken father, state media reported Thursday. The girl, Chen Jin, swallowed more than 200 sleeping pills after she discovered a medical note in her mother's purse that said her father was dying of liver cancer and had three months left to live, the news agency Xinhua said.    Jin's mother returned home after visiting her husband in the hospital to find the front door locked. The mother climbed in through a back window and found two empty bottles of sleeping pills. "Mom, I'm sorry I couldn't stay with you any longer," read a note that the teen had left next to her. "Please give my liver to dad and save him after my death."    The incident occurred January 24 in Jiangsu province in east China. The teen was taken to the same hospital as her father, where she remains in intensive care, drifting in and out of consciousness, the news agency said. According to Chinese media reports, the family -- whose monthly income is about 1,000 yuan ($146) -- has already spent nearly 100,000 yuan ($14,600) in medical expenses since the father was diagnosed with cancer more than a month ago. The mother, who is also in poor health, retired early more than eight years ago.    The woman told China Daily she is now trying to keep her husband from learning of their daughter's desperate act of love.     http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapc...

Did you know that it is a complete fallacy that nurseries sing "baa baa rainbow sheep" so as to avoid any racial offence.   The "story" comes from two Oxfordshire nurseries who changed the words of the rhyme to introduce more vocabulary (colours and adjectives) There was no racial element whatsoever. It′s quite normal practice for schools and teachers to change the lyrics of traditional songs to  suit their purposes.                             For example in class we sing "What shall we do with these two euros?" to the tune of "What shall we do with the drunken sailor?" Not because I don′t want to offend drunks, but because I want to insert the particular vocabulary or topic I′m teaching at the time.      So many refernces to this "baa baa rainbow sheep" as if the traditional song had been banned in schools . It hasn′t.

20090205074040AAyx7pV	News & Events;Current Events	What would you do if someone paid off your mortgage? I have been thinking about the stimulus  package  and?	I think I have an idea. If the government paid off all mortgages up to $1,000,000. ( Those who have mortgages over $1,000,000. either can afford it or they're idiots).The banks would get their money, and people would spend, therefore stimulating the economy. Who loses? Even people who rent would benefit, because people would purchase insurance, buy cars, eat out and shop with the money they would be saving, therefore stabilizing the job market and lowering unemployment. I can't find a down side to this. And all of this would be cheaper than what the proposed spending would be.    I understand conservatives may think this is socialism at work, but the government is talking about almost a trillion dollars in spending. What portion of that do you think you will actually see?  Tell me what's wrong with this idea?

Meanwhile those in the private sector are lucky if they have any kind of retirement provision. Given that Local Authorities offer very poor value for money and that 80% of total council tax revenue is actually paid out in wages, is it not time for the introduction of a national pension scheme operated by government for all so that everyone including the girl who works in Greggs the baker and not just the lofty priviledged cronies in local authority offices can enjoy their old age free from poverty and the freezing cold?
20090205075221AANJkcK	News & Events;Current Events	As You Attempt To Eke Out The Recession On Cornflakes and Toast How Do You Feel About This?	RBS staff are to award themselves record bonuses despite running the bank into the ground and being refloated by the taxpayer. Is this dishonest practise of dipping the till more of the same and prove that lessons will never be learnt in an industry based on greed.    Surely to earn bonuses targets need to be achieved and not manufactured as they have been in the past? Does all of this indicate that the eventual bankruptcy of the UK economy is a certainty and not just a possibility?    http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18/20090205/tuk...

20090205044005AAlNkle	News & Events;Other - News & Events	If the word golliwog is racist, and the doll is too?	 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...          I can only assume if certain people are offended by this doll then they might as well ban all dolls that are of a different colour other than white!   How ridiculous and damaging this PC lark has gone. I cannot see anything wrong with this doll or any other for that matter. It is not as if they are promoting the golliwog in chains etc referring to the appalling slave trade of days gone by.........this is an innocent doll, with no reference to people in my opinion.   Some PC extremists a fuelling the flames of hatred and racism by banning this, instead of treating this doll like any other.   If we are to look at other dolls ........say for instance......action man, all muscles and powerful (an imaginary stereotype if every I saw one)......do we see small, weedy men with no muscles standing up and saying this is a slur on their manhood and their looks?   I'm afraid the only association I see when I look at the golliwog is Robertson's jam and nothing more.   It seems that there are people out there who have nothing better to do than try and incite racism, and hatred among the people of the world.   Yes folks we are all living on the same planet, drinking the same water, and living more or less the same........why on earth we cannot live in harmony never fails to shock and disappoint me totally.   What a sad and narrow minded world we are living in, God help future generations........
