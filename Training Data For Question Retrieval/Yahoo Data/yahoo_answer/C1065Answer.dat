au2o1GD5aa	I go with the XD, definitely, for the reasons you've stated.  But if you are really not all that knowledgeable about guns, I think you should consider a simpler weapon -- especially a revolver.    Autos may seem "cool" but are not as safe or reliable in most situations. I have man, many guns, but nothing that is specifically for personal protection (one of my pump shotguns would be my first choice for home defense). If I were going to purchase a sidearm for that purpose, it would be a Ruger SP-101 in .357. If you need more than five shots, you're definitely living in the wrong neighborhood.|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	Personaly i would always take a Springfield over a Glock, but i hate glocks they are poorly constructed.  I like Colt, Kimber, and Ruger guns|`|pdrgTEUxaa	It really isnt the gun brand...It is really how the gun fits you, and how comfrortable you are shooting it. And if you have children...does it have safties?  Control and comfort and a combination of saftey are the key factors..not just the brand. I hope this helps you..
C0sT0PPyaa	its a formality to show that he checked for earings or foreign substances etc.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	If they do not speak the same language they touch the ears to tell them to not hit behind the ears on purpose.|`|LN2oLOg8aa	just to check if they have some accessories on.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	It's part of them searching the fighter for foreign object or hidden weapons.    Who knows if some fighters use earrings as weapon or taped a small shank behind their ears
kqP7GwOcaa	Margarito's gloves were not tampered with.  Margarito's hand wraps were tampered with, they were soaked in a "plaster like" substance that "hardened".  He and his handlers were forced to re-wrap his hands three times, and the "doctered wraps" are still in possession of ringside officials.  If you ever saw the stuff they wrap a broken arm or leg in that turns into a "caste" you get the general idea that it has no business being on a boxers hands during a boxing match.  It will be interesting to see what the authorities do in this case, it could very well become a criminal case if it can be proven that Margarito actually fought boxing matches with such a "substance" applied to his hand wraps.  Time will tell just how much of an issue this will become, a lot of people will be concerned with the outcome of the "investigation".|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	I don't think the trainer or margarito tried to tamper the gloves in purpose.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	We don't know, no one knows and until the results are released no one should make assumptions about it.|`|q1IRjYAyaa	dont jump on the band wegon,when margo beat cotto all over the news was that margo used staroids & it takesa week for the drug results & even before pplwere accusing margo of staroids..let this case ride & than after the facts we will make judgemant|`|ElH6jMEXaa	I read that he and his trainer's licenses have been suspended.  You don't like to believe it, but when you think about the success of his style it really makes it hard to dismiss.      Here is a guy who basically, doesn't knock anyone cold with one big punch, he is able to do a remarkable amount of damage with single body shots, and the overall damage seems to only get sharper and more devstating as fights progress.      He ran through Cintron twice, both times it looked like Cintron was becoming drastically less able to handle ANY punch Margarito threw, whether it landed clean or not, he was forced to just retreat.    He lost to Paul Williams, because he basically didn't land a punch for 6 rounds, once he started it seemed like his punches added power as the fight progressed - not normal.    He toppled Johnson, who couldn't withstand one punch to the body and was left wailing in pain.    In the Cotto fight too, ANY punch he was throwing seemed to be doing substantial damage, and appeared to multiply as the fight went on.    People were saying he was supernatural or something for his ability to get stronger and stronger as the fight goes on.....well if you hands are becoming more and more like actual bricks as the fight goes on, its pretty easy, as anything you throw is damaging, so the guy your fighting can't really fight back.  It simply doesn't make sense that good fighters who had power were completely unable to take any shots from a guy who doesn't have big one punch KO power.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	If plaster was used to harden the gauze, its physically impossible. I am familiar with plaster. Plaster will break easy if not mix thick enough. I use it in the Dental Laboratory to fabricate dental casts.  plaster is mixed with water. Once is set it cannot be expose  to a wet environment or it will weaken and eventually break.   Because of my experience with plaster I honestly cannot see plaster used with gauze to make the hand wraps solid. The plaster has to set in the gauze for 45 minutes at least and  no less than a 1/2 inch of thickness to withstand a blow and not break. Also plaster once mixed with water it will start hardening, meaning the trainer has to place the unset plaster on top of Margo's knuckles for 45 minutes. At the same time keep the plaster thick enough so it wont break with the blows. No I cannot see this happening. physically impossible.
rzkFHAEJaa	idk, golf?
xvZYt5aQaa	I would say TMAC as well.He is jus as unstoppable as vince but a better shooter & mcgady's clutch factor is way better. A few other things that are significant is that Tmac was great in the playoffs, more of a threat than Vince becuase he can not be stopped when he is on fire. Mcgrady is also a better passer and the guy scored 13 points in 33 seconds. Don't forget Tmac's 61 point game& his 2 scoring titles|`|50bEHtYfaa	McGrady|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Vince|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	Allen Iverson, i know he isnt in ur question, but Iverson was unstoppable in his prime! thats why he got his team to the Finals against SHAQ's lakers|`|AA11716304	t-mac for sho!  but these days even just smiling he might get a cheeck bone sprained!|`|D8IFcgZAaa	t-mac I like vince but he has alot of quit in him ...........vince is a highlight reel but t-mac is a better all around player.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	tracy    vince is more of a show off player|`|Is7WnDKAaa	VC. he was a monster|`|XcfgCOCoaa	T-MAC because he can shoot and dribble better|`|QVDJi2GTaa	Vince Carter,  Could you imagine Carter Lbron and M-Will?

piZ4xDBqaa	It was crazy in the sense that the team that was top rated and eventually won it all struggled so much in the early rounds.  Boston took 7 games to eliminate Atlanta, and 7 more to beat Cleveland.  But they got their act together after that, so I don't think they'll play that way this year.  The rest of the playoffs was pretty predictable.  The only lower seed that won a playoff series was  3 San Antonio over  2 New Orleans in the semis.  In every other matchup, the higher seed prevailed.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	Ummm the CONFERENCE FINALS ARE THE BEST MATCHES...    SPURS VS LAKERS    CLEVELAND VS BOSTON    cmon these rivalry is great.... better than the finals which maybe less explosive....depending on the possibilities    SPURS VS CLEVELAND rematch from 4-0 Spurs 2 years ago  SPURS VS BOSTON is boring.... srsly  LAKERS VS CLEVELAND  --------- ummm KOBE VS LEBRON... whos the best...zzzzz  LAKERS VS BOSTON ummm lakers lose again....GASOFT      ---------    For me last years semis is the best.... CAVS VS CELTS... really took me off my seat....|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Best playoffs in recent memory was in 2005 every single series was a 6-7 game series left and right.|`|NaYoqWBOaa	Cavs got this locked down.|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Last year's playoffs weren't crazy at all.    Both of the number one seeds made it to the finals.    And both the Pistons and Spurs were in the conference finals.    In my opinion it was one of the lamest.    The only good part was that KG and Ray Ray got a ring.|`|uFqkgwhQaa	Cavs might be playing the Knicks if the Knicks can hold the 8th spot  (Knicks and Bucks are currently tied for 8th and Bucks will fall due to the fact they lost Redd)|`|DfPyyDssaa	Yes.|`|V03f8tmMaa	Na i dont think so i mean if the Cavs make it to the eastern confrence finals and go up and defeat the Celtics that would be awsome but we all know its gonna be another boring Celtics vs Lakers match|`|g6tGxoHlaa	I think it is a long shot for the Cavs to make it to the finals. Boston is only one game behind, and I think the Cavs will fall apart due to lack of experience. It will probably be Lakers vs. the Celtics or the Spurs vs. the Celtics. Lakers, however, have a better chance than any team to win it all.
QMveJrziaa	Everything you said would be a great idea. I would like to see TNA bring in a hardcore title and make a hardcore division. (Then bring in Steve Blackman and have him win the title...just sayin) This could work with your extreme invasion, when the ECW guys defeat Booker T for his Legends Title, and turn it into the new hardcore title.|`|5864fJdSaa	maybe 2 and 5 because the x-division is one of the big reasons why tna is so great.|`|LYkmBqRlaa	Reunite Too Cool.  that would be awesome|`|wcCM7y7Jaa	4 or 5|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Make it like ECW,the fed up PG WWE fans would watch it more and get better ratings..|`|2KBN2lCUaa	Merge with WWE (just kidding)    3,4 and 5 wat you mentioned|`|YTLlMdhDaa	Two things TNA should've done, but didn't was to sign Jericho and RVD before WWE did.

DUH!|`|JiCfYfLraa	he is decent not the best ever i think that john cena is overrated because how come as soon as he comes back he gets a championship match. he didnt do no number 1 contender match or nothing. its a free ride for him things are just given out to him and it is unfair to the other raw superstars like cm punk and kane. i have no problem with john cena at first i really liked him but then i started seeing he was winning all his matches and only losing by interruption. everything got kind of boring with him having him beat triple hhh like wtf????? i like cena but he is overrated let other wwe superstars get a few title runs not just him when there are way more superstars on the raw roster that are just more talented then him like cm punk,kane,chris jericho and even shawn michaels.|`|QMveJrziaa	1. Has nothing to do with wrestling ability    2. He has minimal wrestling ability. His matches are all the same, because he was pushed WAY to fast and now we have seen everything Cena has to offer.    3. I have nothing to say here. He is very talented on the mic.    4. Which one? The rapper? The Marine? Superman?    5. Not true at all. There are many female wrestling fans who watch wrestling for more than just looks, and dislike Cena.    6. Your not even trying to make good points are you??    7. Yes, all four of his moves are fantastic.....    8. Was he not voted as worst white rapper since Vanilla Ice? Just saying....    9. Not true....not even close.    10. You are an insult to wrestling fans everywhere...      Although I assume you are just trying to annoy people, and are not a Cena fan at all.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Sorry not even close but he's well...he's okkkk|`|KIOR56r6aa	Why so serious ?|`|Twzg9s0caa	He's not.|`|wtpgEScDaa	1) girls think he's hot and so do little boys and girls, watch out michael jackson, you aint the only one who loves little boys  2) are you crazy?  3) yes he is.  4) NO phucking way.

Girls who think he's hot and little boys and girls.  6) i don't know, maybe.  7) you're crazy and the only person who thinks so.  8) he WAS an ok rapper, that gimmick was great, now his military bs gimmick is horrible.  9) He's NOT funnier than the rock. When was the last time he cracked a joke? like 5 years ago when he had his rapper gimmick.  10) a girl or a little 5 year old boy can judge that because that's all his fans.|`|HvnFTNmCaa	I disagree|`|0HO8sTGeaa	says who.......|`|5864fJdSaa	queer, that funny!  he isn't the best wrestler! my opinion on john cena: great person, horrible wrestler and entertainer.  i love the fact that he loves fans and gives to kids and stuff, but his character really sucks. from being a rapper, to the marine, now he is american muscle. no, john cena just flat out sucks!|`|cE8SQUEbaa	Because he is John Cena.

75ZMWlnnaa	i like him, i guess the main reason is because he is kind of a smart-alec and sarcastic guy, i feel like i can somewhat relate with him, im a sarcastic person as well.    his sense of humour most of the time is pretty good, but there have been times when maybe he can open his mouth at the wrong time.    he has been a top 10 player for the last 6, 7 years and that is an incredible achievement, to sustain that level for as long as he has. i like his serve, it could really kill something haha.    it is a shame that he has been in roger's shadow for such a long time, he would have won another 3, 4 slams had it not been for federer.|`|EWrHbTpmaa	he's 2young 4u Elle...     just don't call his name out when your man is around and u should b cool.. lol|`|9fpJSgsbaa	I have seen him play a couple of times at the Australian Open, we sat right next to his supporters/family seats for an early round match. He was winning very easily and was constantly talking and laughing with his mates and carrying on like a BAD sportsman, showing no respect to his opponent.   I've seen him a lot over the years and get the impression that he has little or no humility, so for those reasons I can say that I dislike him. I dislike people that obviously have no respect for others.|`|39cbcb3803017f914854d7e536ef56e5aa	really like he is american and his serve could kill a man|`|xPCKePufaa	I like him.

It's good to see getting better again.|`|O68932Szaa	i like andy roddick,and a big supporter. i have all faith in him still in reviving american tennis. just an exciting player to watch.|`|2hjMFEUyaa	He has a magnificent serve, but that's pretty much the only reason I watch him play. It's not that I dislike him, he's just not one of my favorite's|`|O36h6DUHaa	I absolutely hate him. He's such a prick to everybody: press, gets pissed off easily by fans, I feel sorry for his fiancee. I hope she divorces him when they get married and takes him for everything he's got!!!|`|FYd1ndVxaa	I like him play. He serves great|`|avLBFWY2aa	I didn't really like his attitude early in his career but I think he has got better over the years. If he ever has run-ins with Novak Djokovic I'll take Andy's side.    He's more of a fighter now, and shown longevity that a lot of players in his (and Roger's) age group have lacked.    He also has a good sense of humour especially when it comes to Federer. You don't see enough of that banter these days.|`|9zX8FIrGaa	I don't really like his attitude, but he's really improved, so cheers for him.. I hope he'll win :)|`|gWLhIoIiaa	i dont like him his game relies too heavily on his big serve.    i hate all the cheap points he wins off of aces|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	i am neutral|`|NdTy3twjaa	I like him, but too bad Roger is always in his way.  He would have 5-6 grand slams by now.
yEsw7UkWaa	Definitly. Victoria has been a dominating presence in the womans locker room and helped to push forward a lot of the women of today, and she didn't rely on a Playboy cover to do it!  She knows how to wrestle and had the fan presence to.  They should have given her the same send off that Trish got.   I didn't like Lita's attitude at the end of her career but I think she also got a bad deal when she left.  So few gals in WWE really know how to go head to head with the guys, their too...delicate!|`|l6g3moiEaa	Yeah, she's been around awhile now, and even though she wasn't as young as all these "Divas", she was the last of the real women's wrestlers. I was stunned when the match was over and they just... rolled right on over the fact that it was her last match. I heard later that she was happy to put over McCool and all, but you know it had to sting they made her lose her last match. She'll pop up on TNA soon, I have a good feeling on this.|`|S6iJSXseaa	yes, i miss her, she was my fav|`|FM2YIhcuaa	YES|`|2FKHNIB2aa	She did say goodbye its on WWE.com she cry and the fans send her off with cheers Its just so sad she had to lose her final match but the fans let her know how much she meant. Will always miss her.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	At least she didn't get the old punt out the door. Seems to be the way to go these days.|`|8Im1iGFTaa	it was horrible how she left they even made her lose her last match and to MICHELLE MCCOOL!  how gay is that its disrespectful after all she did|`|ZNKchhXSaa	I have no idea what you're talking about.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Yes,very|`|IzgJpVgBaa	she did but on wwe.com    but it was appaling how she lost|`|532ca7e079e8f2fbedc1cf289e0db90baa	yes. plus they didn't let her win her last match..|`|E6iGXtyKaa	she's my hero and I felt so let down after her match. she lost and she acted like it was nothing. I really wish she had the womens championship with her when she left. she deserved it. she shoulda had more than just being a jobber. and she lost to a HOOKER! I hate mccool.|`|sgN3xFtWaa	dude she will probably;y be heading to tna. you know i've noticed that tna is very earth friendly as they tend to recycle alot of wwe stars. LMAO.|`|mvTc3GxNaa	yes.       ODB!ODB!    she should go to TNA were divas actually know how to fight like she does.|`|PRk77nm2aa	I'm almost sure Victoria will make a reappearance in the near future. If not oh well,after all Nature Boy lost his last match(but he did get a big goodbye). I'll miss Victoria she was one of my favorite Divas not to mention she still looks good and her finisher was pretty nice.
1uLfl0sXaa	Looks so, but before totally committing ourselves, let us give him a few more innings; as of now, he's the ideal 3.  Now, who should go out to accommodate Viru?|`|AA11088802	Hes played only in one inning and how anyone give this statement... its too early|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|wPlfPc0gaa	Suresh Raina has been successful in subcontinental conditions. And he is a good fielder too.  But it is too early to say whether he is the ideal choice as no. 3 batsman.  Sehwag should open the innings, Tendulkar at no. 4. Rohit Sharma is not the weakest link, but India can do without him.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Its a tough Spot. But he has done well considerably. If Viru comes in He has to move on to No.4. Our Indian Team has now become more dependable at all batting slots even if its shuffled, which is a Welcome Change.|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	Yes.  He is improving steadily.
DfPyyDssaa	Because Da Bulls are the best team in the NBA!|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Because the Clippers suck. They are useless, LA has a team: The Lakers. Clippers??? what's that?|`|1238d8d31da2946a8a5f08dd1fdb4bcbaa	cause they are sick of their team losing.its kind of a diss to their team|`|sI5TPJ2laa	idk lmao|`|uFqkgwhQaa	This always happen why when a opposing team comes into staple center when Clippers are playing|`|UaSFuT59aa	Joakim Noah is god awful. Call me crazy but I like the Clips future. Eric Gordon's a future allstar. Thornton's quality and Deandre Jordan will force them to trade Kaman in the next year or so. If you look past the injured and high priced talent, this team has some pieces. Add another lottery pick, maybe a Stephen Curry and u got yourself a young nucleus. They need Dunleavy to go upstairs and hire a young coach and they'll be ok|`|g6tGxoHlaa	same reason why Boston fans were chanting Kobe for MVP when the Celtics were god-awful.|`|C7nle6Beaa	I can't watch the bulls play they are putting us in shame WERE BEHIND THE BUCKS THE BUCKS O AND WERE TIED WITH THE PACERS|`|jxKQqbC9aa	they want the  1 pick is why they are cheering and Joakim Noah is a retard never liked the guy|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	ive said this over and over again.    joakim noah is the worst basketball player in the nba  and he has off the court problems.    they will cut him after this season|`|piWK49fAaa	because the clippers are a horrible team and organization.
e4roTumKaa	is it Graham Moss of Essendon?|`|K20TzN6saa	John Coleman - i have no idea|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	Well, it would be Graham Moss if you're talking about VFL.

YYqrT4jBaa	If you must have one of those Spyders get the Pilot. If you want just a Spyder then get an RS, RSX, TL-R, or TL-X. If you want a good and low priced speedball marker, the Smart Parts Vibe is a great marker.    If you don't mind spending a little bit more, get a Proto SLG (~$200) or a Dangerous Power G3 (~$300).|`|UlrIgfH1aa	I have a sonix and works great...but I'll get bored and want a new really quick...I would save my money and buy something like the Invert Mini if I were you...I wish I did..
WrDGhduxaa	If your 300 time was 40 flat then you probably came through the 200 in 26, had a one second slow down on the next 100, so with another 100 to go your time will be 40 plus 14 seconds or about 54. Most people will run the second 200 about 2 seconds slower than the first 200 in a 400 race, meaning if you came through the 200 at 26, double that to 52, then add 2 seconds gives you a 54.  If you are very good at the 400 you do not have the 2 second slow down so you can run faster than the formula says you can.  Try to come through the 200 about 1 to 1.5 seconds slower than your 200 race time.  Training for the 400 requires speed work and stress endurance so you can tolerate a higher level of lactic acid without tying up and slowing down.|`|FaqsLRJEaa	I think your 400m time would be in the 52-54 range depending on your finishing kick.|`|94FivE4yaa	I estimated about 51 to 52 seconds if you ran a 400 meter race. I just divided the races your ran by the time it took you to run them. Then, I took the average number and divided 400 by it. LOL I think I did way too much work, but I'm here to help! Anyway, this is pretty good time. An outdoor track is a little from an indoor track since it's bigger. However, you still run the same for most part. I would suggest spending time running on an outdoor track to get use to going the extra 100 meters! I don't really have any suggestions for a workout because you'll still being sprinter just for a longer distance. When you run try to go 100m strding, 100m sprinting, another 100m striding, and the last sprinting. That worked for me and it kept me from getting tired quickly in last 100 meters. I hope you found this helpful and good luck in the 400 meter race!

c03fc4c1b513dca7edce30261069af11aa	No, the team with the Best Record should have home Field Advantage. That's why you play 162 games.|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	No, the best teams in baseball deserve home field advantage if their record shows it. Just like football, best division wins, head to head, etc.|`|yk4S7uuraa	No, the team that has the best record is the one who should host the World Series.    Have the remaining teams "reseed" after each series.|`|EdimolPfaa	Yes I like it.   It would be great if other sports followed. The NHL all star game is kind of a joke. Most all star games are. At least there is something at stake.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Eh; it's no better nor worse than the previous method, which was simply to alternate home league each season.    Littlemary, you neglect to note that the NFL uses a neutral field for its championship game. Let's not hope MLB goes to that.|`|9ZYtLjV7aa	it doesnt matter, but if a good team that earns the better record ends up loosing in 7 games, the it should be reconsidered.  homefie;d really does make a difference to me.
9EpMhhtVaa	That would be a hard sell because I do not think that Melo is even on the same level as Wade or James, but if I had to I would point out his ability to or willingness to post up and he's a better spot up jump shooter than both Wade and James, he has more range on his jump shot as well.  But it's a hard sell because Melo is not as good of a ball handeler than either Wade or Lebron, he's not as good of a passer as either of them.  He better on the boards (statistically) than Wade because he plays Forward, he's not a great defender and I do not see him ever being a player that will lead a team to a championship.  I think he is a great player but honestly I would probably take Caron Butler on my team before Carmelo|`|V03f8tmMaa	I wouldnt|`|LMayULw3aa	only good thing is that carmelo is a great scorer and a better 3-pointer. other than that, lebron and d.wade are better defenders, have developed more in the past 2 years, I agree with the previous guy that said melo is the same player he was 2 years ago.|`|pAzxV8dPaa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...........  cant think of anything..sry|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	He is a great scorer. Like something 30 points in a quarter? thats crazy! Plus when he gets hot he goes over the top|`|D8IFcgZAaa	All 3 are talented players but mello is the same player he was 2 years ago and wade/lebron are on another level ......bottom line is they both play D and mello while he is a threat to score 25 every night so is the man that he is guarding .........and that's real he plays on 1 side of the floor.|`|0yljkLGeaa	Carmelo is a better offensive player than them. if melo could just put a little bit more energy to his game he could be on Lebron's level. because bron is a very hardworking athlete which we can't see on melo's game.  melo is a better outside threat that the 2. he shoots very smoothly and doesn't play that flashy like bron and wade.   all in all the only problem with melo is that he is not giving up what he really got every game..    but i still like him than wade or bron    go melo!!|`|qiCrVC5Saa	The jury is still out on that question.
1NwjxaVZaa	they r goin thru a tough n they seem to not have a good defense  but this usually happens to any team at any day in any game  so hopefully they can turn it around n make it to the world cup n not miss it|`|7Xridrxaaa	haha it was our B squad for gods sake haha calm down but all the merit goes for Sweden for playing a good game. It sounds like your basing all our performances on one game in which we used our B squad haha    @Bobby: which btw had like 2 weeks to practice together and get the game squad together. Versus the 3 days Mexico had haha. Not to mention Sweden had already played a game in which they lost to the US. They had time to fix their mistakes.

1jmXT4Vvaa	They are really similar, so I'd say it's just a styling issue.  I like the styling of the Alpha Black.  I love a good e grip on my paintball guns.  I use a x7 with a e grip and HPA.  It is awesome.|`|YYqrT4jBaa	If you want an M4 style, go with the Alpha Black Tactical. If not go with the 98C. They are both about the same marker. With the 98 Custom, use CO2 unless you're planing on playing alot at a field. N2 tanks are harder to find places to fill them.     Only get an E-grip if you plan on shooting pretty fast. Woodsball doesn't require shooting fast, so an e-grip becomes an upgrade based on preference. If you feel you won't need an e-grip, spend your money on a new bolt or barrel.|`|4reh2baIaa	i really like my alpha black. with e-grip and co2. it shoots great. it can take anything you can dish out (trust me on this one).
1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Decocking, involves releasing the hammer such that it is no longer under spring tension.      Some pistols are built with a decocking mechanism.  Other pistols such as the Ruger Mark series are single-action-only and don't have a decocking mechanism.  They can only be decocked by dry-firing them.  Some guns are built to be dry-fired; some will sustain damage if they are dry-fired.  Obviously, always make sure the gun is empty with the magazine removed and then the chamber opened.  If you ever dry-fire a gun with a bullet in the chamber, you will hear a loud explosion and you will put a hole in whatever the barrel is pointed at.  If your reason for decocking the pistol is for safety reasons, I would suggest that not all handguns are safest when they are decocked.  For example, the Ruger Mark series requires a dry-fire to decock them.  If for whatever reason a live round remains in the chamber during the de-cocking stage, a bullet will emerge unexpectedly from the handgun.  Instead of taking this risk, it is better to remove the magazine, pull back the bolt and lock it in the open position.  With the magazine removed and the bolt locked into the open position, the pistol is in the safest condition it can be.       By your question, I get the impression that you are new to handguns.  I would urge you to seek proper instruction from somebody who knows what they are doing.  There are several 'kinds' of handguns available; and they are similar yet unique.  You need to understand how your gun works and how to use it safely before you begin feeding bullets into it.      Good luck, be safe, and have fun.|`|zxwFva0Haa	wow. okay, first you need to tell us what make and model it is. you can always dry fire, but with a .22 its not a good idea to do it very often as some people say the pin can break or dent the inside of the chamber. there are plastic molds in various calibers you can find for sale at many gun stores for practice loading and to safely dry fire without damaging your gun.|`|AA11318420	First dont load it till your ready to shoot it but if its got a loaded clip take it out of the gun and pull the slide back just like when you loaded it and it will kick the shell out but if you dont take the clip out youll just put another round in it|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It all depends on what model you have. The owners manual should cover this.     If it's a single action design like the Buckmark or Ruger's .22 Auto series you cannot decock it except by pulling the trigger and with a loaded chamber of course this will fire the cartridge. Some of the double action designs like Walther's P22 allow you to put the safety on and pull the trigger to drop the hammer, where it hits a piece of steel rotated into the path of the hammer preventing it(as long as it is in working order) from hitting the firing pin. Others such as Walther's PP series have a hammer drop built into the safety mechanism doing the same thing automatically when you apply the safety.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Depends on the model, really.     If it has an external hammer (think like a revolver), then drop the magazine, clear the chamber, hold the hammer back with your thumb, pull *hold the trigger.     Slowly let the hammer forward, then release the trigger.     If it does not have an external hammer, check your owner's manual. It may not even be an option (S&W 22-A, for example).
czNUMFdWaa	Without seeing you bowl it is hard to know for sure.      The most common cause is poor timing.  If you are too "early" or too "late" that could cause leg and hip injuries.      Another common cause has to do with "pushing" at the line (Also a symptom of poor timing).  If you are, in a sense, "forcing" or "muscling" the shot to create speed, revs, and/or hook; this will cause strain on various parts of your body depending on what you are doing.      My suggestion is to have a coach look at your approach, timing and armswing.  I'd be willing to bet there is a problem somewhere in those three areas.      Best of luck!|`|BkRHMiMeaa	it depends on how you throw the ball, if you try to really hook the ball then it's because you are twisting you leg, i have the same pain and if I don't fix it soon my career will be over at 20 (17 now)
3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	The average bump n run is part of racing. But when a certain few drivers take it to the next level & intentionally take out another driver and possibly several more, that's intentional. Good example ~ Dale Jr.at Richmond last year, that was not an accident. I admit he got even a few races later but he admitted it. He made no excuses or tried to blame anyone else. If you're gonna hand it out, you best be prepared to take it as well. The announcers always try to stay neutral but I guess that's their job. I do think that Nascar needs to watch this a little closer before somebody gets hurt bad. There's a huge difference a bump n run and an intenional spin out. There are times for various reasons when it cannot be avoided. I do not believe the theory that if it's your driver it's accidentional. There are those who think that way, but I'm not one of them. All the drivers make mistakes at some point. They are human.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	There is retaliation and the announcers usually try to say it was an accident so they won't start trouble among the fan base.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Most are intentional..like bump and runs etc...but don't spin someone out. Also...if they do, yeah some have been known to "get even".|`|I6CGhbClaa	Well, those moves were intentional. They were paybacks. But, some bumps are accidental.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	These guys are way to good and I would say that MOST bumps are intentional but they are human and there are a few ACCIDENTAL ones.|`|n55igpCUaa	Depends on who the bumper is. If it's someone who doesn't have alot of controversy surrounding him, it's an accident. If it's someone like Kyle Busch, it's on purpose.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	It depends...sometimes they can be both. But man it is fun when it's the latter of the two. To me that's what makes NASCAR fun...when the sanctioning body doesn't limit the drivers' personalities and lets them duke it out on the track....oh wait...that was 20 years ago.

Just an opinion as always.|`|ALWGmsvlaa	Simple rule :   If its your driver then its accidental.    Everybody else is doing it on purpose.
D3RDQDHMaa	it the player lack of dicipline they show that the dont want to play hard cause they belive that they will actomaticaly think they are going to win every game with pure skills it takes team work chemistry and smart tatics|`|53f6d1583a398f12926f5f4f58e581d5aa	Even worse, because he went to Mexico pretending he was the best coach in the world.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Probably even more dude..  And even more the Directivos that signed the contract to bring him in as D.T. of the NT|`|6uc8ROfWaa	no becuz they send him his players monday practice tuesday and play wednesday how do u expect them 2 play so just wait till they play us then we will criique the game|`|smeaQXafaa	Yes edgar castillo would have been a better choice.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	no he is not....it was a friendly it was meant to try things around|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	yea i didnt understand why he started Pinto over Castillo. Pinto hasnt even been a starter in Cruz Azul.    La verdad, i can care less about this game...i stopped paying attention after the first half, plus we have to admit the game was pretty damn boring.....aver ke pasa Feb 11th    all i know es:    Los Naturalizados didnt do crap(difference)  The starting goolie should still be Oswaldo (not blaming Ochoa)  And we need a creative midfielder (which we know who we need)    ps. have you guys noticed that Pavel Pardo is playing a lil too aggresively....3 games, 3 yellows...(america games and now el Tri)|`|h5wjiC71aa	I think his actually looking stupider than Hugo.     Atleast Hugo knew his players and played them in their natural positions. Sven doen't know chet about Mexican players and our league. How the phuck can he coach a team when he doesn't know the players. His going of what the lil fat phuck next to him is telling him. What's his name? Paco Ramirez?     At this rate I don't see Mexico in 2010. Maybe de pansaso vallan al repechaje. There need's to be changes.|`|ExVTrokAaa	no cuz he doesn't talk **** like Hugo did.|`|33YAhRXFaa	mexico is now stuck with sven. it's too late to fire him because qualifiers are going on and it would take a long time for the players to get accustomed to the new coaches system.|`|LtYg6GXfaa	i agree with you in the most part i think putting in Leandro was a wrong move Sinha should have started Leandro just kept ruining the game in my eyes but for the most part Mexico played a good game and they really should have put Edgar Castillo since Pinto has not been starting with Cruz Azul....and I hated the way Ochoa played even though he almost scored but in my eyes was slowing the game down and they committed a penalty on Villaluz|`|CWTRdrQaaa	I think Sven has a little bit more heuvos that Hugo casue he admits he screwed up, not like hugo, who only talked ****......|`|DGkHpOFBaa	You play the hand your dealt. Sven made the right choice with Leandro, pinto.  I would have loved to have seen Edgar Castillo...Zinha looked old and tired...not the way I remembered him years ago....Ochoa's game...sucked.  Medina couldn't get free on the wing and had to cut back slowing down the attack...allowing Sweden to recover.
39cbcb3803017f914854d7e536ef56e5aa	when your favorite player is roddick it doesnt matter|`|by7BQ2npaa	No. That would be ignorant to only like and cheer for players because they are from your country.  There's too much talent and great personalities out there to do that.  I don't enjoy US broadcasts of grand slams though, it gets too biased and silly and lacking sense to be US-biased because tennis is so international now. Just look at the top rankings.  The days of Connors, McEnroe, Sampras, Agassi, Evert, King, Shriver are over, and the US networks need to realize this.|`|gCW30ejoaa	Nope. I Like the female tennis players the best.

Try this address, I'm hoping to watch the French Open on this website too, seeing as I don't have Foxtel: ATDHE.net    It's pretty good because it shows all the matches that are currently happening, meaning we don't have to watch some player who we didn't really want to.|`|WAfh2Blqaa	it's funny you say Roddick, because i would bet that is based on looks and not talent.     i'm an american and my favorite player is Federer. growing up i loved Sampras though, but also loved Becker and rafter too.     strange thing is that my game is nothing like theirs.|`|2aWCJe58aa	No, of course not ^^ I'm French Asian but my favorite player is Rafael Nadal =) Back in France, it was the same thing, they would only show the highest ranked French players mostly :/|`|gWLhIoIiaa	same problem we have in the usa. they like to showcase american players more|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|8juUgSK2aa	no my favorite was Bjorg growing up and I am in the US.|`|oGBEl25jaa	well i live in the usa and luckily the major serbian players are all highly ranked so they show them, but had they been average players, they definitely wouldnt be televised.|`|EWrHbTpmaa	as long as the chick's are Hot and they happen 2play well    it is then a Good Day in Tennis...   thanks 4the 2points....! lol|`|Wg3UySpfaa	You sad it Elle... that's exactly how i feel also. I'd rather watch a respectable number 1 seeded player or generally from the top 10 than an unseeded aussie who i don't know because he isn't that recognisable due to his not  so quality game.      Not to mention that Australia is a country based on diversity of culture, multiculturalism, so really there's a bunch people who cheer for every tennis player out there, yet they only choose to show the aussies, no matter whether their even seeded. a little annoying.|`|PQK0QjZuaa	No oh and you are real loucky to get answers in just 15 seconds!|`|6433147ab9f09717fe7b72b8c66ba504aa	they probably assume that yall are more interested in australian players because of where yall live|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Not at all.

gfxXikenaa	4-1 for south Africa on the cards~  but australia can pull out a win we cant rule out that possibility ~  hope it helps~|`|AA11088802	Man !  Aus will win it and remain at no.1|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|f9hiPMDxaa	The Australians won't have Clark in their attack so it should even it out. Our biggest problem has been the middle order. Neither Hussey has looked good and the selectors keep toying with bowlers who can bat (Hopes and White).    If SA don't win in Perth, their form would indicate that they will win in SA. I feel that if they don't get to number one tomorrow, they will when we go to SA.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	They can be on top of the rankings table but since Makhaya Ntini and Dale Steyn are rested I guess its looks a little bit tough for South Africa to capitalize in the match.But I am sure they will do well in the match.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Whoever gets to the top will always be under pressure to keep it to themselves,unlike the dominance achieved by Australia for about a decade.  South Africa are the most likely to reach there next.|`|JdNhezdIaa	yip and they will stay there for the next ten years|`|jNn91TwDaa	No, they're not concerned about it.That's why Tsotsobe, Parnell & Van Jaarsveld is gonna get a game.They take it is an oppertunity to blood young players.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Sure Dude|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	South Africa will be the next team taking over that number one position.. If not tomorrow then when Australia come here on the return series.. South Africa's performance are just getting better and better and i see nothing stoping them from grabbing that number 1 position.     we maybe giving youngsters a chance while resting the big boys, but does that does not mean that they not capable of humiliating the aussies even more(if thats possible);-)|`|dqPdoiSYaa	If South Africa manage to win the last ODI against Australia too, then they'll get the number 1 spot for themselves for sure. But that looks highly unlikely to happen, as South Africa is playing with a weaker team than the team they played throughout the series. They've lost Steyn, Ntini, and Kallis from their line-up for tomorrow's match. Whereas Australia has got the boost ahead of the last match by gaining Clarke and Bracken in their line-up again.   Australia has got the definate edge of winning this match tomorrow, unless South Africa's young talents show some brilliant performances and Australia's batting order fails again.  I am guessing 60% chance for Australia to win, and 40% to South Africa this time around.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	If they win 4-1 they will definatly take the no. 1. but, as you said, Australia's attack has been strengthen so they could come back and win it.|`|YcvKwRqiaa	In a way, I hope they do.  Coz do you remember what happened to the last captain who lost a one day series in Australia?  Plus! Can you remember who the two other teams it was against???|`|UlQEgJrDaa	I reckon Aus will win, as others have mentioned before, that South Africa are resting 3 major players,and giving their youngsters a go. The Proteas have already mentioned that being number 1 isn't a top priority.So because of all those factors Aus should win it this time! It will be pretty embarrasing if they don't though !|`|1uLfl0sXaa	Are you sure of this? I understand Australia will  still be no 1 regardless of the result on Friday; I am not sure.  Anyway, that is just a technicality; I think they (SA) are already the No 1 team.
by7BQ2npaa	Please, the tour got better and the newer ones are more fierce, working hard and have more dimensions in their games. It's not like it's Serena's decision. She's not some rocket science. Please, she's not Graf or Federer - and these two were not even perfect.     Some have been saying that the Williams or USTA have been paying off players to lose or tank matches so that a Williams can get through to the late rounds or finals and also for the American tv coverage and ad revenues. Just look at past finals results at the Ericsson Open, Wimbledon and US Open.  All of them had mysterious losses from players or retirements, and then always a Williams got through.  Even at this year's Australian Open, they mysteriously closed the roof DURING the match of Kuznetsova vs. Williams, at the time when Kuznetsova was clearly winning and almost about to close it out.  I thought this was all silly before, but now I'm starting to believe it. They don't like it when there's a no american in the late rounds. That's pretty hard to accept since tennis is so international now with fierce and complete talents all over the place. The Williams are the only American ladies in the top 20 now.|`|sywoTNKgaa	I noticed. It's nice to see her doing well again. She'll keep doing well at majors, but her outside interests will always be there. So far this year she pulled out of Hopman Cup to appear on a game show.    Hopefully will her form will continue to get better because so far it's been unspectacular. She's winning on heart and not playing as free and forceful as she could.|`|sPHkATWFaa	Shes World No.2  currently so i wouldnt be surprised if she won 3 consecutive finals...|`|nkKDUdoraa	she didnt make the final in sydney...|`|4cb49cd1ffbe3d213309a73f4b546dfcaa	I think she's going to do well with the rest of the year. As for as holding the  1 spot, she needs to play tournaments she hasn't played to earn more points. French Open is up in the air. She can definitely gain some points since she lost in the third round. We shall see as I think it's going to another crazy WTA year.

AA10279646	The Trek is a better deal, but I would upgrade the brakes to Shimano brakes. The brakes on the Bianchi are better, but I believe the Shimano components are a better deal. They have more possible hand positions on the hoods and they are cheaper to replace than Campy.     Yes Campy is rebuildable, but you will probably have to wait two weeks for the parts. Most bike shops stock Shimano. As for performance, the Shimano and Campy perform about the same, though Campy has a heavier feel.    Keep it in the big ring.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	personally i would pick the trek. drivetrain, shifters, brakes & hub are shimano. i would have the chainrings changed to 53/39 and cassette 11-25. i like FSA but too many mixed parts on biachi but thats just me.|`|hlhDJpLKaa	I don't think you can really go wrong with either of these bikes. The biggest difference that you will notice is Campagnolo Shifting/Drive train on the Bianchi and Shimano on the Trek. I've used both and find they both work fine.  You may find one comfortable to work with.   The Veloce may be easier to repair if it breaks or wears out.  Shimano tends to take a "replace when fail" approach.  But you will need to ride a lot of miles to get to that point.  The geometry of the bikes may be a bit different.  I have not looked.  If I were trying to decide between these two bikes I would ride each of them and pay attention to how the shop gets the bike set up to correctly fit you.  One of these bikes may physically fit you better than the other.  Whichever one feels the best to ride on is the one you want to go with.   I had a Bianchi once so if the celeste green kind of puts you off at first, don't worry it will grow on you.|`|azzHy4YNaa	Go Trek, you'll never get sorry!|`|yUp5MvG6aa	Bianchi Nirone 7
gfxXikenaa	mendis wont be effective anymore because india has picked his bowling and now he's not that hard to play his spin. you can easily see that through his bowling figures in 1st ODI~|`|AA11088802	ROhit isn't weakest link.. hes good batsman than RAina.. and Mendis will be back|`|AA11599788	In the first 21 ODI matches, Mendis took 55 wickets at 10.22 runs per wicket, each wicket taking him just 17 balls.   This equation totally changed in the last 4 ODIs. He took just 4 wickets in the last 4 ODIs, conceding 31.75 runs per wicket, each wicket coming every 40 balls.  Mendis has been picked. Now, he has to struggle to reach the level of Murali.  As for Rohit Sharma being a weak batsman - it looks like it. The order of Indian ODI batsmen is - Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Gambhir, Sehwag, Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Badrinath, Uthappa, Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan. In the last one year, Rohit Sharma played 29 ODI matches and scored 557 runs, less than 20 runs per match.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	indians have got used to it|`|wPlfPc0gaa	It looks like Indian batsmen are getting the better of Mendis. They have done their homework. Even Murali did not have a good day yesterday.  So it does not mean Mendis has lost his charm. It only means he has to rethink about his strategy and devise new plans to tackle the Indians. Pressure is on Mendis.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Not exactly,less effective on this ground and Indian batsmen are getting accustomed to him.  He may be still good,but to emulate Murali & Warne he has to work more hard and go a long way.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	First of all, who told you Rohit Sharma is the weakest link? He's a more than a good bat.  As to Mends, as you said, you can't evaluate him on the basis of one ODI; but it is true that Indians are reading him better now. Even yesterday, India played him confidently; if they were worried about him or couldn't read him, they'd have hit out; they didn't, and that shows batsmen are getting the measure of him|`|pMTTHWqDaa	i think the indians can pick mendis out of the hand, they hav always been good players of spin,      he does not spin the ball as much as murali so that's against him as well|`|JdNhezdIaa	sri lanka 4-1 you all get a little xcited coz india win 1 game, are you this premature with your wives/girlfriends/hands hahahaha!!!!|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Mendis will be like Worne & murali combined   wait & see~|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Ofcourse he is not a trickster like Murali or Intelligent like Warne.

M0eyMvqlaa	Well, if you lived in New York you'll see that the old stadium and the new one are actually right next to each other. If the old stadium isn't going to be use, that would make it a waste of space. So knocking it down would be the sensible thing to do.     I passed by shea the other day and it's almost completely knocked down. It's basically useless space, Citi-Field looks amazing by the way.|`|xZYS9nDKaa	SAME WITH YOU! There better be a good reason for it.
MbRygPqTaa	Your screwed up man!!! lol  First Scenario: NO you will never b able to enjoy that or any money for the rest of your life, its like you die in that moment too, nothing will ever be pure again.  Second Scenario: NO again, its just not worth the risk of hating yourself for ever, no money is worth your soul, you know why? Because you can get the same or more money doing something you love,like, or dont hate, depending on how much you think you are worthy of. How? Conciously work super hard for months controlling your emotions and thoughts, then put that to practice conciously making yourself happy 90% of the time and other things and situations that make you that happyness will start to "randomly" occur. A year vs. a life time of guilt? worth it to me...  Scenario Three: Well **** since i already killed the guy... Yea id do it, i would have to man! Plus you could always racionalize it to others and yourself, kinda, probably.  Scenario four: No, because someone that has gotten to the point of speaking has something going and no matter what side, the other point of view has to have at least a gram of an understandable side. There are always two stories. Oh and the civilians, gay man! they werent doing anything **** they might be there just to do something, while the guy speaking at least is his opinion or choise to speak. I could understand my death if i was doing something i loved, or at least accept the posibility, but random people no.  Fcuk money!! Doesnt Make you happy, it can help but without yourself you will never truly enjoy it so whats the point, You can always get it in a way that fullfils your soul. Now if your soul is fullfilled when... lol  Every philosophy can be wrong and right so    ??|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	There are only 3 scenarios I can think of where I'd take another life.

I detect self preservation in one question.  As a civilized human being, my conscience and value for life, my moral code would preclude me from killing for profit or pleasure.  Who needs these psychological burdens in life?  On the other hand, self preservation including and extending to those that are of significant relational value to me, would justify guiltless execution in the proper context by the law be that the law of society or the unwritten natural law between men.  Severe and impending threat and injustice to me and mine that cannot be resolved rationally and civilly would be the only conditions that would motivate me to kill another. It would be the final desperate option that would be executed ruthlessly and without guilt.|`|AA11694178	I once worked for the government as a killer for hire........it was called USMC.  That was many  years ago and I have moved on.  I no longer have ANY interest in killing a human unless he presents an immediate threat to me or my family.  If he is an immediate threat to me or my family, I will kill in self defense.  I have no interest in simply killing a stranger for hire.  The earthly cost would be significant but my worry would be the cost in the hereafter.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	1, yes, I need that cash, and its not my rifle.    2, I would never agree to that kind of work, too high profile, too much risk   3, let them come to my house and call it self defense. and how can the criminals prove I'm an assassin? I'm a law abiding citizen. they're criminals with extensive rap sheets.    4, remote? I'm not stupid. I would use a alternative system to detonate the bomb, like a timer, a pressure switch, or a motion sensor. all I need not be at the area of the crime. I could have a real alibi, like purposely getting a traffic ticket when my target area explodes.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	I have no interest in killing for $$ or just for the heck of it, But if it comes down to a bad guy or me and my family I wouldn't have a problem with it.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	It's against the rules in the NHL.      Grant Fuhr was fined in the mid-90s when he painted the inner half of his goal pads black to give the impression of a gaping 5 hole.    As Fuhr is of average intelligence, and this kid has only thought of something previously thought of, it's neither cheating, nor is he any smarter than any other kid.      Lubers - I can't remember what it was - I thought it was bush league at the time.  I can understand Clarence Campbell fining Tony Esposito in the early 70s when he hung netting in his crotch to catch the puck (You need to see Esposito's HOF film to see this) because that was cheating.  But fining a guy for painting his pads is ridiculous.  I'm trying to find a link to the Fuhr story.  Pretty sure it was during his Blues days|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Good for him. Skaters use black tape on their sticks to make it harder to see the puck as well, but I don't see them banning black tape any time soon.  I heard he got a couple of shutouts as well since using the equipment. If anything, it is a good mental screwing of his opponents.|`|AA11674745	No self-respecting goalie would wear that sort of design. I know I wouldn't. Sheesh, netting? What's he supposed to be.....a ghost?    I'd be inclined to use a design that resembled bricks and mortar, maybe even Rosie O'Donnell's *** (or face), even barbed wire, but netting, no way.    Besides, I never needed to cheat. I was so attractive, that all the pucks seemed to strike me in the head.....|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I don't know what the big deal is, but then again, I've never been a shooter. But I guess it does take the shooter an extra second to realize that there's a white glove or blocker in front of the red post and that the goalie doesn't have any legs. It would take another second for the shooter to find a spot and by then, he'll probably be already by the red icing line. All that said, I'm sure shooters can adapt and just find a hole somewhere soon enough.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	I saw that article, and I thought they were awesome.  Cheating?  I honestly can't say.  I've argued with myself over and over about it.    "Well Moose, c'mon, the snipers are gonna shoot in the corners or 5-hole anyway."    "Well yea Moosey, but you see, that's because they see the blockers and gloves aren't there."    It goes on and on, I can't come up with an answer.    I know he's gotten 2 shutouts, regardless of the pads or not.  I think there really cool, I'll say that much.|`|UoUaO52taa	If Flurey can switch to white why not. I think it's genius. Let him. It only becomes a problem if everyone starts|`|FEIXGtQyaa	I actually like this idea.  If everybody else on the ice can use black tape to hide the puck better, why can't goalies play around with their pads?|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Tht's awesome I think Hiller and JS should get some.    I don't think it's cheating as long as the pads are legal size.|`|Z5akjbOOaa	If I was a goalie I'd buy it.|`|tW8fh4IGaa	I don't know of any rules that would forbid these pads. Smart guy.|`|Ipqr3nbLaa	This would not be against the rules .. you still can clearly see it... over time it will get all black from puck marks anyways.|`|9vNeOUBUaa	I agree wtih lazyjbob , there's no rules against anything like that... I say why not?... I like it|`|HNEWf7ILaa	That's not cheating, it's awesome!|`|VvYNeqcIaa	As a goaltender your looking for every advantage possible. Patrick Roy used to wear a shirt so big that there were times it acted like webbing under his arms. Garth Snow's shoulder pads looked like lacrosse pads. Ron Hextall was always bending his sticks in ways to help keep them stay flat on the ice as he moved from side to side. To me as a goalie myself the only advantage I see here may be an optical illusion to the shooter. Much like what Fuhr was trying to do. (Fuhr at one time proposed an Idea to Pepsi Cola to paint his pads like 2 Pepsi cans. Obviously the league batted that down immediately). If you believe it helps you and your confidence and your getting in the heads of the shooters by all means use it. I don't see it at all as cheating. They still have to shoot it by you. There are Pads on the market now where the inner leg of the pads are white while the outside is colored. The shooters use black tape on their sticks and black jerseys in hopes to hide the puck, why shouldn't the goalie try to do the same in hiding or at least causing for a split second to the shooter the illusion of an open net?|`|qH4svuCIaa	omg... where did this kids legs go!?     give me a break, what an stupid idea|`|AA12103453	Don't look like an unfair advantage to me. Maybe if I was on ice level they would fake me out better, but honest I don't see where the pads are really "disappearing" or anything. Hey if they work for him then good for him. Anyway yeah it was an eye-doctor who explained to him to switch to white pads as they wouldn't show the open spots as well. If I was an NHL Goalie and wanted to use them I'd just go ask the league about it, no point buying them and finding out the league won't approve.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Being a goalie I think his idea is unique, but he's got too much time on his hands.    ps. Any of y'all ever use CAMOFLAGE (you know, like what the U.S. Soldiers in Vietnam wore) on a stick blade? That is also quite effective.|`|PwED69Isaa	I personally don't know if that would be against the rules... but I'm shocked how good that looks.|`|JHcqLEJUaa	Great idea!  Not sure if it will really affect his stats but ehh, they look sweet.|`|G33E41IBaa	It's only cheating if it's against the rules.    Everyone was completely outraged when Avery pulled his move on Brodeur, but technically at the time it was not illegal.  Stupid, but not illegal.    EDIT: I was actually thinking of Fleury when you asked this question.  The reason he changed his bright yellow goal pads to the white ones was to blend in with the ice better.  Goalies with white pads aren't breaking the rules, so I doubt this kid is.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Thanks for the link........I say it is VERY innovative UNLESS it is against the rules. It seems you have also pointed out the rules SO I don't know..........     As far as Fleury, I don't know if it was a study but he was just told by an eye doctor in Ottawa(I think) and it really seemed to improve his game. They say alot of cars are more visable on the road (seems true) and I would think that white would be best for the players..........that is why I was surprised to see Carey Price's new pads (unveiled during the all-star game and just happened to match the East's jerseys) because they are colorful.     When you get into camouflage, it is stretching the rules alittle and I guess having a broad rule explanation giving the authority for someone smart enough to think of this is a good thing.     Does camo go as far as attacking the integrity of the game? Maybe! Remember the Avery incident.......that attacked the integrity, the rule was there but they just had to enforce the wording of it, this good be similar in that retrospect.     Thanks again for the link. Interesting.|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	I don't think it would work very often/very long. Guys would get used to it. They're athletes, not moles.
gBfPkdroaa	damn i'd have to say troy polamalu.  like 90+ percent of the time, hes always near the damn ball whereever its thrown!    idk if its eyesight, his awareness, or what!  Polamalu is a beast and is probably one of the couple steeler players i like.    but dont get me wrong, fitzgerald is good too, the guys 6'4 (correct me if im wrong) and can sure catch a ball, even in double coverage/team(?)    but polamalu overral is a better ballhawk.|`|AA10653749	I'm going to say polamalu.    But when i 1st saw this question,i thought you were going to say who was the better defensive players who are ballhawks,because my pick was Ed Reed !    He's always around the ball !|`|7zVlPwVEaa	actually i don't know about it  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|eIOlBzm8aa	A ballhawk usually refers to DBs since WRs job is to catch the Football.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	Ed Reed is better than both of them...but out of those 2 i'd say larry fitz..he's a wideout|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Polamalu, outstanding player and really helped Pittsburgh get to where they are now.|`|FmZyN6ORaa	Troy Polamalu  Fitzgerald has been outstanding this postseason, but was average during the regular season. He has a lot of talent, but Polamalu is more consistent and is just better overall. But then again it's hard to compare them because they play two different postions..

FYd1ndVxaa	I'm using double-handed backhand. Maybe u are using your dominant hand more in your double-handed backhand. Hitting double-handed backhand is like hitting a forehand with the less dominant hand. Maybe u can watch more video of it online. I learn it that way too. Most one-handed backhanders use eastern backhand grip. But some extreme single-handed backhander use semi-western backhand grip to generate the most amount of topspin. Some players will mix up the use of the two grip.  You can get a view of how to grip the handle here:  http://www.tennis.com/yourgame/gear/gene...|`|KR3IvxNwaa	i know,, if you want to use two handed backhand you need to always be steady every time you hit the ball and it costs you energy. but the benefit of using two handed backhand is you have more control on the ball.    so if you want more simple on your backhand just use one handed because it's quick to learn but you need a good power on your hand.|`|cgb4WOnVaa	I can't tell you about grip - but you've stated the basic pros/cons of the two-handed vs one-handed in your question.    For reach/range, the one-handed backhand is more effective; but for strength and accuracy, the two-handed backhand is more reliable.    You need to work on strengthening specific muscle groups that you use when you use your backhand to improve it - well, that and simply practicing against a backboard (do they still call it that?)    As a side-point - if you're constantly having to reach to make your shots - forehand or backhand - there's something else you're doing wrong:  You're out of position to make the shot.      Watch the pros - very rarely are they forced to take an uncomfortable shot.  They nearly always use their feet and their ability to predict their opponent's actions to be "in the right place at the right time".    That's one of the great secrets of winning tennis.|`|xPCKePufaa	I totally agree with the answer above. In the way of grips, there are several different ones you can use. The eastern backhand is slightly past continental, with the knuckle of your pointer on the top bevel of the grip. There are different degrees of this grip; the full and the modified. The modified is slightly closer to the continental grip, while the full is a bit more... well, farther away from the continental grip. Really, its best described through pictures. If you search for "backhand grips" on yahoo, you'll find a lot of good articles. Here's a decent one I came across:  http://tennis.about.com/od/forehandbackh...|`|WAfh2Blqaa	if you are unfamiliar with a one-handed backhand, it might be a little late for you to make the switch. if you have a good two handed backhand, but just have issues with the balls you reach for, then i would just develop a potent slice backhand (something which Roddick lacks) and just keep the 2-hander on everything else in your wheelhouse. Dont switch...just develop what you have. Also...it sounds like footwork and footspeed may be an issue too. if you can get to the ball in time, you should have no issues hitting a solid BH shot.|`|Jfh4uvcWaa	well to be honest,i think it depends what raquet you use.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Lygie is/was a bike of Italian origin which was eventually folded into the brand Atala. It was founded about 1902 and was sold until about 1975 so I think a good guess for your bike would be 1971. I think Atala may still be available in Europe albeit probably made in China or Taiwan.    Now, that being said, we have some nits to pick.    First of all, if your bike has 7 gears in the back whether it be a derailleur system or internally geared it is NOT original. Another clue would be to check the shifters... are they indexed? If indexed, that is yet another clue that it is not original. Going a step further, if any of the parts are not of French or Italian origin (this means Normandy, Simplex, Nervar, Galli, Campagnolo) then this is another signal. Despite the bike being Italian they were always outfitted with French or Italian parts... who knows why other than the age predates the common use of Shimano or Suntour.    All this being said, the main value of the bike would be in the original parts and the VERY cool headbadge. You might find some more info if you search for Umberto Dei bicycles.

txfebYGVaa	You definitely have the brains to be a linebacker. If you want to know how big a jv linebacker should be and if you should play that position you should give some stats about your height and weight not how much you can bench. If you run fast and are hard to tackle you might want to consider a position on offense. For a better answer go to the football section to ask your question.|`|EJn3K9zjaa	You realize you put this in the swimming section...? Lucky for you I played both in highschool.   First of all, the size (population and physical size of students in) your highschool as well as the skill level that many of them may be playing at will go far in determining the answer to your question. If you happen to play at a big football school or for a team that is well known for their program, then you may be on the small size right now, but its nothing you dont have the opportunity of overcoming in the future.  Second, your bench isnt bad for your age, but pretty far below a highschool linebacker, at least at the level I have experience at. Again, this is something you can improve on over the next four year. Also, the curling ability isnt a very good indicator of your potential, I would suggest focusing on the three main lifts: Squats, Power Cleans and Bench.  Finally, as for a position, I would try out for both sides of the ball if you can. If you think your hard to tackle because your quick, go for tail back, if your hard to tackle because you can run people over look to full back.  Hope this helps, good luck|`|vy78bq81aa	yea im the kid that answered the question i got my passowrd    so0o i played center and defense tackle. as a center i would say i had the most accurate snap in the league and a pretty good cut blocker but not good on a linebacker blitz. as a DT I would always jump over the o-line cause im smart of the field. i can take a double team very good and mostly dont get touched cuz im quick off the ball.    I not very good at taking a block by someone i dnt see and dnt use my hands alot and cant take a juke very best.
oPbLcfKoaa	This is a copy of an answer given by Bikeworks about a hundred times....    Painting a bike well takes a bit more than a whim, a 6 pack, and a weekend. Do it right and it will look great, do it wrong and you'll wish you never did it.    This answer is long but will give you an idea of what to do. Want a quick answer? Take the bike to an auto body shop and have them do it. It'll cost about $100 if YOU take the bike apart.    Use DUPLICOLOR brand LACQUER available at most auto parts stores. In the UK, I don't know if the brand exists so you'll need to locate a brand of acrylic lacquer. DO NOT BUY ENAMEL OR URETHANE!    You'll need 1 BIG can of grey sandable primer , 1 can of base coat (if the color requires it... many do... read the can), 1 BIG can or 2 SMALL cans of the color you want, and 2 or 3 BIG cans of clear LACQUER.     Here is a quick explanation of what to do...    1) After completely disassembling the bike have it sandblasted to remove ALL the finish. If the frame is aluminum, it should be walnut shell blasted, or you can chemically strip the paint. Just make sure all the paint is OFF the bike.     2) READ THE CAN INSTRUCTIONS, then spray it as soon as possible with grey SANDABLE lacquer primer. DUPLICOLOR brand paint is all lacquer, I think, and you can get it from your local autoparts store. Buy the BIG cans, not the small ones. Apply at least 1 full can, in coats, 15 minutes apart. Don't worry about light runs for now.    3) Wait at least 48 hours. There is a difference between dry paint and cured paint... it needs to be cured. Sand the primer using 220 grit aluminum oxide paper (white in color) or wet/dry paper (black in color) until the surface is smooth. It shouldn't take much unless you have a lot of runs.    4) Using a tack rag, lightly go over the entire frame (don't rub!) to remove the sanding dust.    5) Apply several coats (3 or 4 perhaps) of the base color (if necessary), then color of your choice. Make sure the frame is completely covered, it is not necessary for the color to be on thick. Follow the directions on the can. Again, use LACQUER, the same brand that you used for primer. Apply coats 1/2 hour apart. Be sure you cover every part and do NOT get runs. If you get runs you are applying it too heavily.    5a) IF you wish to add decals, wait at least 8 hours, apply the decals, then continue. Make sure that you avoid touching the new paint as much as possible and to make sure there are no marks from water or "sticky stuff" on the frame. If you don't want to add decals, continue immediately to the next step WITHIN 24 HOURS...    6) Do NOT sand the color coats. Apply the LACQUER clear coats, perhaps 2 full cans worth, coats 15 minutes apart. If you put decals on you should spray at least 4 cans of clear.    7) Let the frame alone until you can't smell the paint anymore when you get up close and take a big whiff. If you can smell it, it ain't dry! This will take 2 to 3 days at least.    8) Wet sand the entire frame CAREFULLY with 800 grit silicon carbide wet-or-dry paper (black in color), then 1000 grit silicon carbide wet-or-dry. Make sure to keep the paper wet and to wipe away the white slurry that forms. If you start to see the color in the slurry, STOP! You have sanded too hard and reached the color coats. Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7, then try again. Don't try to "touch up" the area, it will look terrible.    9) Using white paste polishing compound, follow the directions and polish out the whole frame.    10) Do NOT wax or wash for at least 10 days.    If you rush this you will end up with a sloppy mess and you'll kick yourself for ever trying. However, if you take your time and do it right it'll be a very cool feeling.    Have fun!|`|fabhI1cSaa	Strip off everything that you don't want painted. Clean and sand all surfaces. Practice on something to get a "feel" for it. We used to paint our bikes when I was a kid. Some turned out good, others not so good. We just started over when we needed to. Good luck.|`|KIHzTJ54aa	Itd be better if you took it apart and just painted the frame dont get any paint in the headset or in the crankset. Otherwise it looks like sh t|`|d20evTAwaa	dont do it it will look real bad unless you dont care then use special paint im not sture what kind but the normal stuff will just flake off|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Well, thecheapbikeshop got to this one before I could so I would say that he has the best answer!|`|Ipqr3nbLaa	Dont it will look like crap|`|Hq9NPQkOaa	strip the bike then sand the frame till its smooth then paint|`|ElQ4styUaa	well most bikes these days are powder coated paints so most paints will eventually just flake off.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Try searching for questions first.  That question has been asked and some good, very detailed answers have be posted.      The short answer is that it is like painting anything else.  Preparation, multiple thin coats,  and drying time.

0Pv2jt8faa	From a guy's perspective, it's alright if a woman's eyes wander.    I mean, your boyfriend sure as hell looks at other women, it doesn't mean he's going to mount them or anything.

eIOlBzm8aa	Your bench should at least be above 150 before your 16.  Squat needs to be over 250 for sure especially since you need strong legs for a RB.  40 needs to be improved to about 4.8 when your 16-17.  Vertical-try to improve it and it should go up as you grow and squat more.    They are decent for a 14 year old.

Obviously, as of right now I hate them (Eagles fan!), and no matter what happens I will never in any manner cheer for Eli Manning, but I do respect the Mara's as owners and what their new GM Jerry Reese has done, I think he's a smart guy.    Also, as much as I despise him for jumping ship, I do have to give Steve Spagnuolo just the tiniest amount of love for being connected to the Eagles somehow.  Oh and also Jared Lorenzen.  He's fat, that's just hilarious.|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	B) There is always the NBA and NHL    Could never root for the choices given, Cowboys, Eagles or Redskins.

I live just outside of Baltimore so I would have to be a Redskins fan. I like the Ravens also but am a Cowboy fan because there wasn't a team in Baltimore in the late 80's when I started watching. And if you live in the Baltimore area, it's a major sin (punishable by death) to cheer for ANY Washington based sports teams. Or I could root for the Eagles and join the crowd of drunk, dirty, stinking bird fans.|`|py0DpCh4aa	a.  seahawks|`|XzD1Sgvuaa	Whoa! That is a CRAZY question! But i would have to go with option A.

I'm a Jets fan and I don't plan on ever changing allegiances, but I'd much rather root for the Bills than not watch at all.    At least I'd still be rooting for a New York team, technically.    (edit:) anyone else find it funny that Jets, Pats, and Dolphins fans all chose the Bills?

Nuj1eScCaa	1. No, he made it because he had exceptional basketball skills at Washington, actually he could both football and basketball and decided on basketball. His size was a negative if anything, and is probably why other teams passed on him.    2. Nate Robinson's rookie contracr was only 2 years and worth about 2 million. Last year the Knicks exercised their team option and signed him for an extended year and again this year. All in all he's made about $3,556,320 to date not including what he will make this season which is $2,020,178.    He will sign a new contract either with New York or someone else after this season.|`|DNkavhfBaa	hes a restricted free agent next year..this year he makes about 2mil..hes an exciting nba player (one game hell score 20 in one quarter,next game hell make so many stupid mistakes you want him dead)but hes gotten better evry year|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Nate Robinson gives 100% every game he plays in if you watch him.

He's become a better player than I ever thought he would, but he doesn't know how to keep his composure both with his attitude and with his play. First of all, after every bucket he makes, he shows some kind of emotion. There's an unsaid thing in the nba called "act like you've been here before" which is why players don't flamboyantly boast all the time, only when its really called for. U hit a 12 footer little buddy, no need to flex like you're Zo. Tonight, he caught an alley oop, which was nice and maybe the 1st of his career. On the way down, he's posing and nearly gets a tech, in a close game mind you. Then, 5 seconds later, full of energy from his dunk, lets his man blow by him and gives up a foul. It wasnt crucial but it was entirely indicative of his lack of concentration and self control. Plus, he's not a starter in the league and has never seen the playoffs. So what the hell are u always posing about little man?

50bEHtYfaa	I had to do this in high school for 2 years. I was on my high school varsity basketball team. I had school from 8 - 3:30. Then I had practice from 5 - 7. In between that time we were allowed to do w.e we wanted until practice started. I basically did a study hall, which is where I did my hw and studied for previous tests. After I got home from practice I ate showered, relaxed for a little and did any hw I didn't finish and study for a test. If you put your mind to it, you can do it. All it takes is confidence. When your in class, focus on school not basketball. You will learn more and pay attention more, which you will have to study less. When you are on the court, dont think about school. It's all about making time for school and basketball. If I did it for 2 year straight, you can do it to.       Best of Luck to you.|`|V03f8tmMaa	Say you have to do something on the computer and watch games and maybe you can learn from there|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	one or the other is it truly that hard|`|ovBNkYtpaa	study for 25-30 minutes. play basketball for 15 ? study outside in your garage so youre already right there... or combine them... study basketball .|`|VsmqrHoqaa	finish homework first play rest of day|`|5zqsMSLpaa	I agree with AGENT 0|`|Ipqr3nbLaa	put notes on the ball.|`|3wHWIAIYaa	Why dont you follow my schedule,I practice after class,in the evening,with my teammates,after that I went home and finish up my homework before I go to sleep.Its a little bit of tiring,but at least peoples wont assume that you are a lazy kid when you fell asleep in a class.Hahaha.Thats what I do.    But,I usually finished up my homework during class so I can sleep soundly at night.|`|H9G8y1acaa	How much do you need to study?  If the only two things in life you are doing is studying and playing basketball then you shouldn't have any problems. If both these things are important to you, then cut out something else, whether it be tv, girlfriend, going out of friday and saturday night, or whatever. If you want this bad enough, you'll find a way.
RS3fjNboaa	I would referee Super Bowl X. The Steelers did not receive one single penalty in that game. What a crock of sh*t!|`|2CuuIT70aa	Any game not involving Jon Gruden.  Man he gets in those ref's ears.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Super Bowl XXXI. Not because of bad calls though, because it would have been incredible to be on the same field as the Packers in their prime in the 90's. Brett Favre, Reggie White, Antonio Freeman, Gilbert Brown, Leroy Butler...etc. I'd have to hide my bias though, but that would be cool. The legends of Super Bowl I and II would be awesome too.  One more, if I could slant the game in any way (not cheating, just being acutely aware of everything the Giants were doing) I'd choose the 2007 NFC Championship game and somehow the Packers would come out on top and go to the Super Bowl.|`|oqeoUKj2aa	Colts agianst Chargers....that was horrible....      but i would love to ref that Pats Colts AFC championship game in 2006, that was one of the best game i have ever seen|`|6149747106ff1de5673d8b19c36bf46baa	tuck rule game between the Pats & Raiders, not to change the call, i hate the Raiders, but i think it be cool (and cold, no pun intended) to officiate in that kind of weather|`|acaAycEXaa	The two Cowboys/Steelers Super bowls in the 70's. the Cowboys would have won both if it wasn't for biased officiating.

Just to add to the conspiracy, I would go back to October 27, 1996...a regular season game between the Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots...there were a couple of bad calls and the Pats won 28-25...    If the Bills would have won, they would have finished 11-5 and won the division over the Pats @ 10-6...    Steelers would have went to Buffalo in the playoffs to play and probably would have won...then they would have played against the Jags @ home since the Jags were a wild card...    After winning that, they would have faced the Packers in the SB and would have won their 5th SB...making the one against the Seahawks their 6th and the one against the Cardinals coming up their 7th (if they win)...|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Are you kidding, I'd officiate any NFL game that I would get and be thankful for it.|`|fk30FQz2aa	In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed.

3teWTOPqaa	Plus he is the best center in the Western conference. Plus the fact since he joined the Rockets they have made the playoff 5 out of 6 times, plus he is one of the few big man who can draw double teams on a nightly basis. Yao probably will never be as good as Shaq in his prime, but just because he isn't another Shaq doesn't mean he isn't good.    A.I Fan: are you serious? Didn't T-mac declare blame it all on me?

Yao Ming is awesome. Are you better than him? I don't think so so shut your trap.|`|UaSFuT59aa	Yao's impact is sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, he is the most talented player we've ever seen at his height when u compare him to bol, bradley and muresan. He's made great strides since he came in. He's improved greatly on his footwork, post moves, rebounding and conditioning. In terms of defense, yeah, he doesnt have the mobility of a marcus camby, but his wingspan and body in the lane leads to dozens of altered shots in the paint that dont show up in the box score. He's arguably the 2nd best center in the game behind DHoward and has one of the best touches for a big man. Hes a very wellrounded player but has been on an awkward team and is missing some accolades because of his team's failures. Yao's an anamoly and we should appreciate him while hes here|`|dtq32xuwaa	he plays basketball and cooks chinese food thats why|`|e86d0dc04b8341bfbc95ea7381d26e5faa	i think you answered your own question somewhat.    ppl think certain players are good bc they are seen positively through the media|`|tYZQTBVRaa	your spelling is off the hook
KF7alakOaa	102 mph   thrown by joel zumaya    and hit by david ecstien in the world series when stl beat detroit 4-1|`|nkyRezB7aa	I'm not sure about the fastest hit, but an obscure guy named Steve Dalkowski is said to have the fastest  pitch reaching speeds of 108 in the late 50's. Dalkowski was not physically imposing, standing only 5'8" and wearing thick glasses. He had legendary wildness, which kept him out of the Major Leagues. In 995 minor league innings, he walked 1,354 batters and struck out 1,396. He walked 21 in one minor league game and struck out 21 in another. In high school he pitched a no-hitter while walking 18 and striking out 18.|`|13f7f9399c9bc7922d4dc2fb3445e850aa	103 mph, is my guess|`|jLfH4VH1aa	well that's pretty difficult to measure, because MLB doesnt use radar speeds as an official statistic, so they are just based off of the sometime unreliable ones at the stadiums.     but..some guys can hit a 100 mph fastball if it's straight. i remember manny ramirez doing just that off of hard and flat Kyle Farnsworth. Kyle had been hitting upper nineties-100 on the gun and then Manny drilled one. It's possible that it wasnt measure correctly though, because the ball no doubt comes faster off the bat, so that could mess up any measurements, so if I were you I wouldnt know how to go about this

Iverson in his prime was one of the best scorers the league had ever seen. He led a pretty talentless team to the finals. Essentially what Kobe tried to do in those years they couldn't get out of the first round. Iverson was more unstoppable, possibly the most unstoppable guard of the past 10 years. Iverson never was a good defender though. Kobe has been dominant on defense, giving him the edge.|`|67ZgA0PZaa	the kobe of now can realistically be compared to MJ.    hes the best player in the league right now,  and would be my first choice

Do as much training as you can on the surface you will be racing on, Grass in particular likes to steal the spring out of your step making it much more difficult to run on. As far as diet goes, carbs are crucial, pastas are great and seafood is very important in the case you are increasing your mileage as when doing so your iron levels may fall.|`|isEUxMXsaa	leg excricez  frutiz  lotz of carbz

I live in virginia on the coast and my county is one of the last counties that is legal for hunting with rifles. It mostly has to do with population density in the county you live in.  Most rifles carry a lot further than shotguns, so if there are a lot of houses and people around a rifle round may accidentally shoot someone.  Im sure that a lot of texas is legal for rifle hunting, but you would have to check the laws for the county you live in.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	Check the Texas DNR website.    http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/hun...
XUUDRM7yaa	Honestly?   Just roll.    Although it feels bumpy, there are very few staircases that are steep enough to cause you any trouble as long as you maintain a firm grip on the bars and don't let your front wheel wander off to the side.   Just point it down, shift your weight slightly back and low if you feel you need to, and roll.      It really is that simple.      The spacing on some steps will feel a little more harsh and bumpy than others, but that depends on how tall the steps are, what tire pressure/size you're running, and on the wheelbase of your bike.      If you're scared of the final step/landing, then just trust your bike to carry you and roll it.  Once you do it several times and get comfortable with the rattling, you can try to pull back on your bar before you hit the last step to lift your front end up just a bit and ease that last transition to flat.  You don't have to, though...your bike will do it for you.       Be sure to air up your tires to the max pressure (45psi minimum, if they'll take more, that's better) to help avoid pinch flats, and if you have some cheapie wheels you can expect to get some dings eventually.    Ride them for awhile and try to ride several different sets of different heights and pitches......then if you want you can start to gap small sets.

Hold your arms as straight as you can and steer down, maintaining pressure on your rear brake, but easing off on your forward brake.  Push your rear end way back behind your lowered saddle and bounce down in a controlled bam...bam...bam, with your knees absorbing the impact. Try to get your body and head down and eyes forward as you descend. Avoid situations where your high center of balance could get thrown forward. Being ready to "bail off" backwards or to the side if control is lost will help prevent being thrown forward over the handlebars if control is lost.      I think the lowered seat post is the most important element.  There are some new seat posts like the Crank Brothers Joplin with remote control levers that allow riders to adjust the seat post height while riding in order to get better control on technical downhill courses.

nZhjosjZaa	I have been wondering this exact same question for some time now. When Kane was originally introduced, he was feared, and he was dominant. The first mistake they made was taking his mask, he lost all his mistery. I liked how kane was mysterious, unpredictible, and psychotic. Now no one is scared of him, and he looses to people like morrison. They should find another person to put people over with, and bring back the old kane.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Because WWE is stupid now and Vince is a hack.    Stop watching wrestling now, it'll just disappoint you more in the future.|`|GKJV2EBSaa	Kane wants to help young talent and(I think) if you can get a win over Kane,it would be big.Though i don't know if its really worth it because Kane is kind of sabotaging his career don't you think?Kane needs to go over to TNA and they can bring the old Kane back.And it would be great if they could do a storyline with him and Abyss or him and Mick Foley/Mankind/Cactus Jack(Even though i highly doubt that will happen.)|`|iWcTmuhAaa	actually he is there to build talent, no matter if he wins or lose he is one of the highest paid wrestler who is getting almost same pay as Batista.    but I agree, he needs a world title around waste.|`|aTKKg9nHaa	Kane doesn't want the belt, he wants to build new guys, he's more than happy to lose.|`|ONuy5vniaa	kane is always happy to put over young talent because he knows its about a good performance and not always about winning all the time.    Which is more then could be said for egos in the buisness (cena, Batista, hhh) and looks great on him for his dedication.    He does deserve a major title run, all he needs is a good storyline to lead up to it which he will probably not get anytime soon.|`|l6g3moiEaa	I don't know why the WWE won't give him a decent storyline nowadays. Can he not put guys over AND have good storylines like his brother? I thought they were going to put him back in his mask for a second there just before the whole thing with Rey Mysterio, but, er... no. Quite frankly, I still think he's a top tier guy around there. It's harder to take him seriously since the loss of the mask and mystique, and since the loss of good writing for him.|`|mvTc3GxNaa	Whenever Kane came back in WWE, he was all mean.

AA11016927	Incurrigable is totally accurate and has many good points , although, in my opinion, trolling for Kings, Dolphin, Wahoo, Etc does NOT require 80LB line. In fact, many King-fishermen in J-ville, Fla use 25-30LB (and as low as 20LB) line and get more hook-ups and bigger catches. Go to http://www.floridasportsman.com and ask Q's in the Forum section and they will cover you up with good info, (Heck, they might trade you a trip!)    Here's some ideas on Reels and Rods :    Technically, what you want will be 2 (or even 3) different "sized" outfit's with 2 very different lines and size reels.     You should have (at least) 2 "lighter tackle" outfit's for Trolling lighter lines for Blues, Spanish, Etc and 2 heavy duty outfit's for Dolphin, Kings, Etc. (And if I were you I'd have a couple outfit's dedicated to bottom fishing.) You could have MANY more outfit's but starting out with 4 GOOD ones is better than having 6 cr@ppie ones.    Here's a good tip: Spend more on your reels than your rods. Why? When you are offshore there are very little "obstructions" and any reel's drag will generally get a hard "work-out" every time you catch a fish. That's why it's important to have the finest reel you can possibly afford VS a $250 rod.     MANY fishermen use Ugly Stik boat Rods that cost $60-$80. They are inexpensive and tough as nails. I suggest you do the same. Go Ugly Stik for your rods. A good idea is to buy ALL your equipment from a local Mom & Pop store, (and keep ALL your receipts). It might cost you a couple dollars more to purchase, (or order) your outfit's from a local dealer but in the LONG RUN it will benefit you greatly.     Here is a list of reel options that have excellent reputations:    Light Tackle Offshore Spinning-     1. Fin-Nor Offshore Reel model OFS 65- http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    Although this reel is a bit heavy, it is one of the few spinning reels that have the capacity to take BIG fish AND smaller fish with ease. In my opinion, if I was outfitting a new boat with reels and rods for Offshore fishing THIS REEL would be my  1 pick for a light-heavy weight spinning reel.      2. Penn Slammer model 560- http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    Other than the old Penn SSm the Slammer is superb, (but doesn't have the drag ability of the Offshore Fin-Nor).     3. Shimano Baitrunner model BTR 6500B- http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    Baitrunner= old reliable. And the Baitrunner feature is awesome when drifting live baits.      For general Trolling here are some conventional reels that work great and are inexpensive:    1. http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    2. http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    The Triton is awesome for most anything.     Hope this gives you some good ideas on what to purchase.     Just remember! Great reel mediocre rod,  NOT great Rod mediocre reel! If you don't trust my advice make sure to read the reviews about the above reels (and Ugly Stik Rods) at Bass Pro.     Bottom line- Get 2 OFS 65's, 2 Shimano Baitrunners, and 2 Tritons (and Ugly Stik Boatrods for each) and you'd have one HECK of a start towards offshore fishing! (If 6 outfit's are too expensive go with OFS 65's and the Tritons.)     Good luck! And good fishing!|`|OP7lLIitaa	a really big cane pole|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	There are a million ways to fish in the ocean near the outer banks.  Since the jetstream dips so close to hatteras, the fish selection is endless.  I live right on the middle penninsula of the chesapeake so a trip to organ inlet is just a hop and skip away.  Trolling for blues is pretty simple, although ive never tried trolling for weakfish. If the blue are feeding heavy trolling with spoons and minnows and anything else that would remotely interest them.  Ive caught blues off of a Styrofoam bait cup before.  Blues usually tend to strike at a high trolling speed, but lower than spanish mackerel.  Blues tend to school with or behind spanish, so when youre trolling for either, use small silver or gold spoons.  Trolling speed can vary from 5-8 knots.  6.5 knots will get you strikes from both blue and spanish, Any slower will bring you more blue, any faster will bring you more spanish.  When i troll for either of those I like to use medium action rods with spin reels as they dont strike as hard as other sport fish.  Any decent spin reels will work shakespeare, okuma, or penn spin reel. I keep the test of the line to around 50lbs.  Trolling for tuna or dolphin the best speeds seem to work between 6 to 8 knots with clones or plugs, swim baits are different and usually require slower speeds.  But theres no concrete trolling speed some days different speeds work best.  If youre trolling for yellowfin tuna they spook easy. You also have to take into consideration the wake your boat puts off and how your baits react to the wake.  I would use stiff rods with Penn reels made for trolling.  The penn senator 4/0 and up are great for trolling for smaller sportfish.  I would keep the test of the line at around 80lbs.  Bailer dolphins are caught easy enough on regular spin reels or open face with a good leader and chunks of ballyhoo or jigged lures.  Theyll be found near any large floating grass or anything to have cover, most of the times when you find them trolling theyre running from larger fish trying to eat them like tuna or billfish.  Hopefully that will get you started, and good luck|`|oMjVp4zGaa	Bass Pro Shops has a division called Offshore Angler some items for inshore are duplicated and many fresh water rigs will work for years and years in salt water. I have used BPS (bass pro shops) own label pitching sticks for over twenty-five years. I have broken and fixed both tips.I think a 6 1/2' heavy action one piece pitching stick (no telescoping handle ) with a lightweight levelwind reel (daiwa 27SH) will work for up to 3 ounces of weight and easily bring in up to forty pound fish and a saltwater medium heavy 7 1/2' one piece rod might go to 6 ounces and matched up with either one or another penn, shimano, daiwa or okuma reel (whichever feels best in your hands) will work for everything but over 200 pound fish.
I1w0HfQbaa	His prices are bit on the cheap side. However, I have ordered DVDs from www.boxingdvd.com and his stuff is cheap, though not as cheap as this guy, and with the exception of the Douglas-Ferguson fight the picture quality of all the fights were pretty good. I think his stuff is cheap because he wants to undersell his competitors and he doesn't do things like include cover art, cases, and motion menus for his DVDs, he just includes the fights and they are usually wrapped in paper sleeves instead of cases when he ships them out to you which cuts back on the shipping cost.

hlhDJpLKaa	Your tires will be fine as long as you get whatever caused the puncture out of the tire. You only need to be concerned about replacing the tire if it gets a large enough cut. You can usually tell because when inflated the inner tube starts to bulge out.  If you plan to ride regularly it will be worth it to buy a vulcanizing type patch kit and learn to use it. It's not hard.  I have never had a patch fail once installed. Don't use the instant type patches.  They are great for temporary fixes but they eventually fail.   It's a lot cheaper than continually replacing tubes.

by7BQ2npaa	Hopefully any of the top players who have the unique game with total professionalism and grind it on the tour week-in and week-out while staying healthy and strong.  I hope it will be Elena Dementieva.  She deserves a slam or two, and to be No.1 because ranking points aside, she is clearly the definition of a No.1 in tennis.  A great personality as well, great looks and total class.    Here's something interesting though.  Lately, I've been coming across tennis fans and insiders comments saying that the Williams or USTA have been paying off players to lose or tank matches so that a Williams can get through to the late rounds or finals and also for the American tv coverage and ad revenues. This would also mean that they assume Americans want to see the Williamses.  Or if it's not, then the Williams just want to buy their way into titles.  But it does seem connected with the networks.  What happened to tennis?  Is it like fixed boxing now?    Just look at past finals results at the Ericsson Open, Wimbledon and US Open. All of them have had mysterious losses from players or retirements, which would always help a Williams get through.  And of course, they would aim for the prestigious tournaments such as Wimbledon.  It's hard to believe because most of the tour are true and complete talents that are so fierce, that the Williams sisters have been clearly surpassed for years now.  Even at this year's Australian Open, they mysteriously closed the roof DURING the match of Kuznetsova vs. Williams, at the time when Kuznetsova was clearly winning and almost about to close it out. I thought this was all silly before, but now I'm starting to believe it. The us tv network coverage seem to not like it when there's a no american in the late rounds. That's pretty silly and ignorant of them since tennis is so international now with fierce and complete talents all over the place. The Williams are the only American ladies in the top group now.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	Serena williams,venus williams and Dinara safina are the main contenders.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Maybe u shouldn't use the word 'regain'.

PsCS0GK3aa	my guess is that the trophy cabinet doesn't want miranda stalking it.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	@Cabinet: One of these days I'm going to show up at your front door and moments later you'd be history...muhahahahahaha<br>  <br>  OK lets do some guessing:<br>  Im guessing hes a guy<br>  Im guessing his name is Walter as well<br>  And I'm guessing that Marky doesnt like the joke his avatar potrays, even though it is true:P|`|mK06dus9aa	That explains why he doesn't know that it's Man Utd he is supposed to hate.<br>  <br>  Arsenal are all soft and cuddly since they stopped winning. Why hate?|`|VpiYSQVnaa	i dont know but i think he has a thing for miranda<br>  <br>  Can we name him Chester??|`|wQUkZm2Oaa	Well that trophy cabinet is probably quite dusty by now so I'll go with Dustin :D|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Cali?

eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	I think they'd like to have Chad Tracy make a comeback at 1B and they'll give him every opportunity to win the job.  Clark is a part time player at this point in his career.  I think they're fall back option is to put Connor back at 1B and hope tha Byrnes is healthy enough to play LF.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Tony Clark the Prospects are not ready and I see Potential in him BTW, Only good things will happen here for Arizona.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	I don't see why the D-Backs would want to make Byrnes the fourth OF. This guy is two years removed from 20HR/50SB.  Sure, he's gotten a little older, but the guy still hustles and I'm sure he would help the team out a lot as a starter.<br>  <br>  I would say: Byrnes = LF, Jackson = 1B, Tracy = 3B, Reynolds = Bench....of course, they could always platoon Tracy and Reynolds (Tracy starts vs. righties and Reynolds vs. lefties)|`|fKAnnQeWaa	What about Chad Tracy? He is pretty good. <br>  <br>  I say either move Mark Reynolds to 1st (Maybe the less impact he needs to put into defense could increase his power swing and become an Adam Dunn) and put Chad Tracy in 3rd or keep Tony Clark in 1st. He seems to be a good leader.|`|gUMucKOkaa	Well, everything that I have read is Tracy to 3B, Connor back to 1B and Byrnes to LF. At least that is what they are hoping.<br>  <br>  Reynolds Ks too much and has a low BA. He will be given a chance but if he falters he is probably on the bench.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Tony|`|pndDah25aa	Well at least the DBacks have a good 2nd baseman this year......

Chivas also plays good with pure mexican players and they win matches. Mexico needs argentinians, brazilians etc. to play well, even though they don't, and they have a hard time winning.|`|CWTRdrQaaa	I would go for chivaz cause the MNT suks chorizo know.......|`|b1ca3f5e6e5466981ff2b50c7568e497aa	Chivas would murder the national team. I bet the Chivas team could carry Mexico and qualify for the World Cup|`|LtYg6GXfaa	I would go for Mexico but it would be hard because i love both teams but i will still go for Mexico|`|HQZsotL7aa	Hala Madrid!|`|GmfE8RzHaa	Who else Chivas they're 100% MEXICAN!|`|1NwjxaVZaa	i have 3 fav clubs  Real Madrid, Manchester United, n AC Milan  even though im mexican ill go for either one of my fav teams cuz honestly they got talent at every position n got great team chemistry|`|SVmsA8MMaa	chivas suck why you may ask because they get elemanated quick  at the copa libitarodes look at america look at their trophys and pachuca cruz azul pumas and other teams but im just saying club america the best
RS3fjNboaa	He pretty much gets all the 5 star recruits in the state of California. Plus, most of them know they will never start but they still go to USC. I would say that's some damn good recruiting skills. I don't think he's the best college coach, but his recruiting skills always give him one of the best teams.|`|uoEfoI7aaa	HE IS ONE OF THE TOP THREE FOR SURE...  I WOULD ALSO PUT MAC BROWN IN THE TOP THREE...|`|3XHcBcrgaa	Gators?|`|acaAycEXaa	NO! Anyone can recruit when they bring a suitcase full of money like Carroll does! The guy should be in prison!!!    Barry Switzer was the best recruiter ever!|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Well I want to go to UCLA? lol you convinced me.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	When Carroll first started, the old coach left him with injured RB's and a FB to take there place....Now he gets some of the best RB's in the country and he has like 20 starting RB's on his roster(over exaggerating)....not only that, he gets the best talent at every other position as well....    Carroll is a F@ KING GENIUS!!!|`|B6dQzaGyaa	I would not say the best ever, USC facilities and location do alot to help him recruit there, a new coach with USC recent dominance would be able to pull talent there as well. There were some older coaches in 70s and 80s and 90s that were great, but recruiting was diff then without the internet and rivals and all these....he is a good one, but I would not say best ever. His assistance play alot into helping him as well, its not just all him, he may be the deal closer, but the assistants build those relationships up.|`|1gPJO37qaa	Who cares if hes the best if he cant coach them to beat unranked conference opponents
FaqsLRJEaa	You should always do a few minutes of easy jogging before you stretch and run.  And for stretches, the link below has some pretty good ones.|`|Gz9z6q17aa	Honestly, the best time to stretch is after you run.  Static stretching prior to running can actually improve your chance of an injury.      Think of your leg muscles as rubber bands.  If you repeatedly stretch a rubber band when it's "cold" it will eventually snap.      Swinging each leg back and forth(front to back) gets your hip flexors moving and the blood flowing to your legs.  Standing on your "tiptoes" repeatedly will do the same for your calf muscles.      My point is to move a little and get everything warmed up-don't just head out the door and take off running.  Start slow and build into it-before you know it, the mileage will start adding up.    Check out the site below.  It has a ton of helpful stuff.    Good luck!!

DGkHpOFBaa	Because we don't have LaVolpe as coach....that's why....  USA gets better because as the game wears on...they get stronger...they are more physical and match fit.  They have a rigorous fitness regime.  They work more as a TEAM..And just like Mexico they have foreign players on their squad. So obviously that isn't the problem...|`|ew7nQKXSaa	Look, we all know that if Mexico got SERIOUS, it would be a different story.    The only problem is: Mexico getting serious.|`|1NwjxaVZaa	i would say its all based on team chemistry becuz u cant build a good team overnight|`|b1ca3f5e6e5466981ff2b50c7568e497aa	Yeah at least the USA plays like bitchhes and win game by defending their goal and taking advantage of opportunities to score.

JUST A BUNCH OF LOSER TALK!|`|LtYg6GXfaa	well the usa team keeps winning because they play in their home turf and Mexico has been messing up because they just can't seem to score and also they dominate teh field they just can't seem to score thats the problem we need a Goleador like back in the day......and you can't blame it on Eikcson he doesn't really know the Mexico playing status
c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	The local bike shop is always the place to start.      Unlike the internet or big chain shops, local bike shops will have their finger on the pulse related to local bike activities and clubs.  The people that work in them will also have an interest in bikes, being able to offer valuable advice and support that just isn't there in Halfords or Tescos.

4SF4KGu4aa	The only problem you may have with Hoppe's is that is has a pretty aggressive copper cleaner in it. Nickle plated guns are steel plated with copper and then plated with nickle. If there are scratches in the nickle , or thin spots, it could conceivably start removing the copper under-plate and then your nickle would flake off.    I have never had a problem leaving small parts and even cylinders ( blued or stainless) in Hoppes. I generally will use something else on nickled guns. I've used JB bore cleaner also and a Lewis Lead remover. Some of the can be pretty abrasive and you will want to rinse the barrel with some type of solvent to make sure no gritty bore cleaner is left. Lewis Lead removers are nothing more than a screen patch that scrapes out the lead but I wouldn't overdue it and would probably use different bullets if I had that much problem with leading.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	I use Break-free CLP, you can let that sit overnight.     Hell, it's a cleaner and a lubricant.|`|AA11729094	I have 2 large sardine tins on my bench that i use for soaking small pistol parts. I have one that I fill with butch's bore shine and soak barrels in, and the other is for hoppes. I have a Beretta barrel soaking in the hoppes tin right now, it's been soaking since yesterday afternoon. I'll do the same thing with the butch's bore shine, let a barrel soak for a solid day before swabbing it out.    In my experience it does not harm the finish nor the chrome, if so lined. Been doing it for years.    I run the solvent thru a cheese cloth strainer and back into the bottles when I'm done, and add fresh solvent to the bottles when needed.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Hoppe's  9...not long it's strong stuff.

jf0UV1Bjaa	There are a lot of older guns that are hard to find ammo for.  But one gun comes to mind is the 7.35mm carcano.  It was first made to be an upgrade for the 6.65 carcano but ww2 broke out and they stopped upgrade and kept the 6.65|`|fUDlbOP0aa	I have a Steyr M95 rifle that's a wall hanger I bought for $30.

I bought the wall hanger version instead.      Everything else I have it would either take a very unconstitutional law to ban all unregistered ammo or a world war 3 before I cannot buy any ammo for them due to price or lack of availability.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Thankfully, no.     But, I also try to stick to more common calibers, .22LR, 9x19, .40, .45ACP, 7.62x54.

Wished I could remember the company name right here  in the USA.
br1kwegaaa	I honestly do expect them to win a minimum of 20 games this season.  The fact that PJ Carlesimo is no longer coaching the Thunder is a case of addition by subtraction.  They have been on a mini-roll since Brooks has been brought aboard and have won 6 out of their last 9 games after beating Memphis in OT.  Please remember their top 3 players (Durant, Green and Westbrook) are either first or second year players and are still maturing.  Krstic just came in and should make more of an impact as the season goes along.  There are plenty of really bad teams in the Western Conference this year (Sacramento, Golden State, Memphis, LA Clippers, Minnesota) to allow the Thunder to find several victories down the stretch.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	lol what expectations?|`|2gPrqvqHaa	They're about where most would expect.  Polar opposite of the Oklahoma Sooners.  Potential perennial losers, the Thunder.|`|UaSFuT59aa	Absolutely. People were talking about them having the worst record ever. I noticed Durant's play picking up in December and the team started competing every night since the beginning of january. When they took it to denver, i knew they were on the rise. I'm impressed and I hope Scotty Brooks gets the job. Durant's a future mvp, write it down.|`|GHPBT29Caa	They have a solid point guard in Westbrook who only needs to stop throwing bricks at the charity stripe to make him sub-elite. They have 2 great pure scorers in Durant and Green...    All they need is a center to be a contender. Jeff Green is the team rebound leader at just over 6 a game on average. They score very few points in the paint and just get outclassed in the PF (lol Collison) and C positions. One big man in the low post should pull in some boards and open up the outside shooting even more.    They have the money to make some good cash deals in the off season, through trades for cash or with the FA wire. Not to mention their impending number 1 draft pick.    With some good GM and Ownership moves in the offseason, I can see them being contenders next year.|`|LdIgg7yTaa	Hmmm... they're still a lost case. Even when they're playing the kind of ball they played tonight, when they win, for the most part, it's against teams like Memphis.|`|PHoyqLN9aa	No.  They needed a different coach.  Good thing they fired that dude.  Durant plays SG now and he's exploding.  All they need now is trade up some of the bigs they aren't using and get some shooters.  Also trade up Watson cause he's still valuable and they wont need him with Westbrook there.

95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	You're going to hate me for this, but it can vary considerably. The factors influencing your costs are these.    1/ Your back yard.  You can have two identical pools, one in your yard and one next door and the costs can vary. Vegatation and what drops in the pool has an impact on your sanitizer use and water balance. Exposure to an area that wind picks up dust and debris too. That dust carries organics that your sanitizer needs to oxydize.    2/ Bather load.  Same situation, identical pools. One family entertains often, the other doesn't. The one that entertains has a higher bather load and more organics introduced to the pool. They also have considerably higher chemical costs and maintenance.    3/ How well you look after your water balance and equipment.  Ignore your water balance and your costs shoot up more than they would normally be, to try to fix a problem. If you don't keep your pump and filter operating at peak efficiency, you're chemical costs rise too. Cleaning baskets and strainer baskets is important as is cleaning out your filter when required. Leave it in a reduced capacity state and you'll use more sanitizer to keep the pool looking good.    4/ Pool water temperature.  The higher your pool temperature, the harder it is to keep your chemistry balanced and the more organics that people leave in the pool. People sweat. More sweat , more organics. The optimum temp for most pools and people is between 78-82F. Warmer than that and your costs start to climb a steep slope not just in chemicals, but heating as well. At night the air temps drop. If you don't put a solar blanket on the pool, and that air temp drops below that of the pool water, heat from the pool radiates to the air. You use more fill water (cold tap water that's not balanced) to replace what's evaporated off that you need to heat up and add chemicals to balance it. Algae also loves warm water and will bloom faster in it. More organics.     So, every pool is different. Calculating out an exact running cost is impossible. I can give you a guide only, in what amount an average pool, that's run by a pool guy would cost, with average weather, average clients and average equipment.   Shock: Calcium hypochlorite: On average a littel under a bucket and a half for two months. A typical bucket is 8kg and retails here for about $60 bucks.  Chlorine pucks: Stabilized chlorine pucks, nothing else, don't use the unstabilized variety. On average, budget about a bucket per month. $55 bucks a pail of 7kg.  Acid to adjust Ta and Ph: If you're on top of your chemistry, one 4L jug will last a month, perhaps longer depending on the amount of rainfall you get. Acid rain is a reality and shows in your pool readings. $6 bucks a jug at a hardware store. $8 bucks at a pool shop.     Those dollar amounts are for my area, north of Toronto, Ontario. I've had party animals for clients that doubled that cost and lousy backyards doing the same. It'll vary. You'll also come across some specialty chemicals that may be needed to treat the pool, such as sequestering agents for high mineral and metals content fill water ( wells and such) and even algaecides for spores of mustard and black algae which chlorine by itself rarely fixes. Clarifier is handy to have as a back up as well but shouldn't be needed if you've kept on top of everything and your filter is working efficiently.     If that pool is running on a salt water generator for a sanitizer, you won't need pucks and you won't need shock. Only in the case of a dire emergency. You'll still need acid and the odd bag of salt. Typically, two bags on spring start up and if you're running a sand filter, two more bags during the season to account for water/salt loss during backwashes. Usually no bags if that's a cartridge filter or DE filter during the season. Cost of a 50 lb bag, $25.   If you don't have a salt generator, you might want to look into one. Initially they're expensive ( 1200 bucks installed) but they pay off on average in 3-5 years with reduced chemical costs and maintenance. The're pretty idiot proof. Set and forget essentially. The only thing is that instead of having your water checked professionally at a shop twice per year, you ought to have it done 4 times. Since no stabilizer is being added by pucks ( you don't need the pucks with these units), you need to keep an eye on that level and add stabilizer if required.     One last thing. Your pool will be at least 8 feet 6 inches deep. That's the minimum  depth by law in North America for a pool to have a diving board.    Edit: Seeing as it's a forclosure, I agree, it'll probably be in bad shape. They usually are on house sales with the pool closed, in my experience. Two grand in chemical costs is excessive. You won't be spending that no matter what the backyard conditions are or bather load. As for a drain and wash. That's applicable to a concrete (gunite) pool. If this is a vinyl liner, it's not. You shouldn't be draining one of those unless you plan on replacing the liner. The act of draining itself will destroy any chance of a more than 2 year old liner from going back into position. Drain it to clean it...you're buying a new liner. If the pool was closed by a pool company, it should be clean and water relatively balanced. If the home owner did it, you'll be looking at a swamp. Sorry, but that's what I've always found in this situation.

AA12170560	The position of Quarterback is THE control point of the entire offense.    Often called the on field commander, the QB makes the plays.

Yes, the get treated pretty well...typically the hero of the Offensive game. If they are school bullies, you'll find them benched. As far as popularity, quarterbacks are usually the most popular guy in the school as well.    On our team, a quarterback with social issues or problem behavior will NOT play.

l4pVsxoraa	Hardly a fair thing to do since Crosby and Lecavalier are still active and who knows how long or how much long term impact they will have.<br>  <br>  I'd go with Beliveau, Lemieux then Neely.  Beliveau first because of his longevity and the Montreal dynasty that he played for.  He played 20 seasons for Montreal and won the Stanley Cup 10 times.<br>  <br>  Had Lemieux's career not been cut short by health and injuries he may well have exceeded Beliveau's accomplishments, but he did not.  Lemieux played 17 seasons, winning two stanley cups.  Neely was an awesome hockey player but not in the same league with either Beliveau or Lemieux.<br>  <br>  As far as Crosby and Lecavalier are concerned.  Lecavalier is now in his 10th season with TB with one Stanley Cup win.

AA12274507	This is common if you are using Hollow Points. The magazine may also be the culprit as well. The snap caps I used to use would do the same thing.

The H&K mags are supposed to be great but problems are still possible.<br>  <br>  -edit- If multiple magazines behave this way and the ammo is undamaged FMJ then I would bet there is some issue with the rifle itself.

If different magazines don't work, then you may want to have someone look at it in person so that they know there isn't something wrong with the internals, which would be my next guess.<br>  <br>  The problem with the civilian-issue version is that they're modified after-production to not be able to fire burst mode, so they alter the trigger and the feeding mechanism, which can eventually lead to problems such as this, or exactly the opposite- it will fire in two or three-shot bursts instead of single shots.|`|7UbfExoKaa	SPORTS!<br>  <br>  Slap, pull, observe, release, tap, squeeze.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1535169" rel="nofollow">http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=...</a><br>  <br>  Always let the cocking handle go, and then tap the forward assist to ensure that the round is fully home.

(A mob called Warhawk used to make them. There is probably a few others)    It could be worth experimenting with shorter crank lengths to get your cadence higher. Having closely watched,,,,ok,,, perved at women for several years now, I have noticed a couple of things (more that the usual two). One of these is that they generally have a larger thigh to shin ratio. This means that for any given leg and crank length the knee needs to bend farther. Reducing the degree of knee bend will help improve cadence.    Say you can get your cadence up to 105 then you would only need 68/11 combination to do 80 km/h. I came across this a while ago, it is fitted with a 68/52 chain ring   http://www.twbents.com.tw/HTM/r20.htm    To be fair to the bike shop, there wouldn't be many that would expect a petite female rider to try pedaling to speeds of 80 km/h. (At least not in a standard road bike.) There are bikes that will do this speed, though at the first hint of a hill the speed drops rapidly to something quite ordinary.    Close to "off the shelf"  http://www.m5-ligfietsen.nl/site/EN/Carb...  custom made  http://www.recumbents.com/wisil/coslinge...

Even though Nadal hasnt lost a set hes not playing even close to his best. He has to be extremely careful with Verdasco, Verdasco's confidence is probably very high after those 2 impressive wins. I was surprised how he destroyed Murray and Tsonga. Federer seems to be on top of his game but vulnerabilities are still there. if nadal can get past Verdasco than he has won Australian Open, becuase he has studied Federer's game to the core, and he hasn't lost to him in over a year.

I think his just the protective big brother, tries to act like he really doesnt care but deep down he does and she knows that, he is her brother after all lol!

f49ZZ8ILaa	I like to look at the chest, not really dial in on it but keep your eyes there most of the time. I think that, for me at least focusing on the eyes or head isn't as effective. Especially while boxing or even fighting a good boxer in mma. If they have good head movement it can trick you into reacting when you really don't need to. The best advice I can give though is to just keep sparring and find what works best for you.|`|10QSTGWAaa	KEEP EYE CONTACT.    You can see where his eyes move, and predict his moves more easily that way. However, you shouldn't rely on this too heavily, because they can use your focus to their advantage and pull a feint.    Hope that makes sense.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	I like Benji's answer: Focus on nothing; be aware of everything.    The eyes can tell you a lot, but different opponents have different "tells" (to use a poker term). Some may take a slight step forward before a certain move, or reposition their arms or hands slightly. And it differs from fighter to fighter.    When you have the opportunity--such as at a tournament--the best thing to do is to watch your opponents. Example: Grappling tournament. Watch the opponent for their preferred style. (Do they have a wrestling background? Jiu jitsu? Even judo.) Then watch for their preferred moves. Then watch for the tells. And watch for their weaknesses--do they relax their guards in certain positions or at certain times?    Be aware of it all.|`|NzvXINyGaa	I was always taught the chest.    worked for me.|`|ZWVQEhSdaa	ALWAYS LOOK STRAIGHT IN THE EYE!!!!!!!    looking into the eye can be critical. every move can be see from the eye!|`|C0sT0PPyaa	bruce lee says the eyes..but what does he know about fighting?|`|wyWGtzfAaa	I was told to NOT look someone in the eye. Yes you can read them but they can read you too.  It gives away what your doing just as it does for them. Also, most MMA fighters I see do not make eye contact.  You should try to look them right below their neck in the middle of the chest.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	focusing in between like the neck area.|`|IrnHxv0iaa	I am sort of a wrestler, and like to fight, but I would say kinda mix it up...If they feel that you are focusing on there head they will try to sneak one in, and if you are on there chest you have no clue what they are thinking. so pay attention to both|`|67ZgA0PZaa	keep eye contact,  but focus on the silhouette|`|1Byis7Flaa	Boxing taught me, in most cases the opponents eyes will get bigger when they are about to strike or kick...  But  you should be focusing on nothing and aware of everything.    It is like a window of where your personal space begins.  Is the window small?  Master, what do you mean a window?  Well grasshopper, with in 12 inches around you is your personal space. And your eyes only allows you to foward. Not in front of you, but grasshopper what is ahead of you, forward.  Master I think I understand but not really.    Grasshopper, if you focus on 1 thing you miss out on everything.  Keep your eyes open and be aware of everything   Therefore your window should be 3 feet by 3 feet.

Just keep moving the best thing to be is UNPREDICTABLE!|`|19TupZ8Naa	The eyes, mouth, neck, and upper chest. I generally use the neck as the center. So I have eye contact, and I can observe his breathing. The neck is also a good target for strikes. I generally don't worry so much about strikes, as long as I can block the important ones.     However, I am good at taking hits and I don't avoid attacks. That's just how I was trained. I see an attack as a chance to counter not as an "Oh-Crap I better dodge this."|`|ldGz9UoBaa	the chest is focused on in muay thai and i don't like focusing on the eyes because they can be used to fake you out in a sort of eye feint. so use the chest but don't focus use your perepheral vision and forward eyesight in unison, this should be practiced alot.|`|9fsIHOIPaa	my teacher says head but i perfer the chest cause then you have a view of everything. the eyes and shoulders may lie but you can tell when limbs are committed

wphUIz0naa	There are two other Chinese arts that are very similar to Bagua Zhang.  The first is Hsing I.   the second is Tai Chi.    Remember there are many different systems of Bagua and Hsing I and Tai Chi. These names are generic just like Kung Fu, Karate, and Tae Kwon Do.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	First of all, to the answerer above, Aikido is Japanese and not Chinese.    And UFC is a sport with rules even from the beginning of it which start with no eye gouging and no small joint manipulation and as such is not a measuring stick of martial art in the world.    Chinese art that allow you to turn the strength or force of your opponent against them will be Tai Ji (Tai Chi), make sure it's Chen style as that's the style that use Tai Chi as a fighting style.     If you actually live in America in California, I will recommend sifu Adam Hsu school. His lineage is very-very strong as he could trace his Ba ji Quan to Li Xu Wen (a legend of his own)  Ba ji Quan is the art made famous by Video Game Virtua Fighter. It's the one that Akira uses.    Lineage is very important as there are lots of McDojo out there especially in KungFu, karate and Taekwondo. And from what I've seen these past 2 years, McDojo-ism even already crept into Brazilian Jujitsu.    Hope this help.|`|67ZgA0PZaa	aikido is one.     even though martial arts was invented in asia,  I'd stay away from them if i were you.   there are much better ones out there.|`|sfuayrMvaa	Judo, jujitsu are not Chinese but do use strength and force of opponent against them.      About which Chinese martial arts are similar to Ba Gua, I am not qualified to say.  My teacher is qualified but that doesn't help right now.      I think I can say that Chinese traditional martial arts would use the opponent's force and strength against him/her, but perhaps in  different ways depending on the art.      I suggest you find a very good teacher for a traditional Chinese martial art, and begin to explore.
ElH6jMEXaa	I still feel he would have had a shot to beat anyone when he was at his best.  I remember he was sitting ringside doing commentary when Lennox crushed Golata, I think that shook him a little bit.  But if Holyfield, at 46 can bascially beat one of the belt holders (remember John Ruiz was almost beat Valuev and beat Holyfield 2x), I think that a prime Roy Jones could have been more than just competetive.      I think Holyfield who, was never a natural heavyweight and never had a big punch, is the prime example to look at for all the people on here who just point to size and say 'no way he could have beat someone so big, he'd get KO'd' or whatever - Holyfield went 24 rounds with Lennox Lewis, who was the best of all these heavyweight monsters, and was never even in danger of being knocked down.  He may have been outboxed, but he wasn't bowled over by size.      Boxing isn't a video game or some crap - things get much more equalized when you factor in real speed and skill disparity.  This isn't Sam Peter standing right in front of a Klitscho just wanting to trade, this is a guy who moves fast and quick, lands shots they won't see, and gets out of the way.....its not Ivan Drago punching that power meter, your power is a meaningless unless you can sit down, balance and throw shots.  Roy, at his peak, never allowed anyone to do that to him.     His speed and movement would have been a problem for anyone weighing 250+ pounds, and chasing someone that fast around the ring could have worn them out.     - to the guy who says Roy never had great skill?  Roy had unique ability, which he blended with boxing skills to create an unorthodox style, which made him more flexible to adjust to styles, and made him nearly impossible to prepare for.  You don't stay at the absolute top of boxing for 10 years without top level skill....he isn't the first guy to come along with quickness, speed and power.|`|SiIN4n65aa	I don't think that he has it anymore.

The whole making history mumbo Jumbo. He won the fight to his credit but fought relatively safe opponent in John Ruiz. If Roy were still a heavyweight or stayed their longer he would have seriously been hurt. Glen Johnson put the heat on him and made him sleep at 175 now image what a 6ft 5in 250 pound Wladimir Klitschko would have done to him.    Jones was never a great fighter because of skill he was a great fighter because speed and athleticism. If he fought longer at the Heavyweight division it would have been harder to pitty pat and jump around with guys like the Klitschko Brothers or Lennox Lewis Jones would have gotten stretched. (NO DISRESPECT)|`|sBdOzbx5aa	I know this may not make sense to someone who does not study the physics of the sweet science, but he does not have a large enough skull to fight real heavyweights,  see Glen Johnson footage.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	he doesnt stand a chance. as great as roy is, he is not at par with klitschko,  even valuev would give him a hard time (though i feel this one could favor jones. lol).    the blinding speed he used to possess is already an afterthought.  if he fights now he would rely solely on his strength and jones is not one of the stronger fighters out there with a killer knock out punch.    i think he would get creamed.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	i think he is done he had is day maybe a few good fights left but not as heavy maybe light or middle he is good but to small for the over 6' 5" fighters now|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Jones would be too small for today's heavyweight class.  Even at his best, he won't be able to knock out or, much less, outmuscle those 6'5"-6'6", 250-lb. giants like the Klitschkos, this despite their lack of talent.  Their just way too big for Jones.  And now, that Roy's weak chin had been exposed, I doubt if he could take the punches of these big boys.|`|jY6cis4Kaa	I agree with Normen 100%|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	no, he would have had lewis,both klitchko bros, byrd to deal with. he would never be able to get past lennox jab to win the fight and byrd would make him look slow since byrd was actually faster at 200 pounds than roy was. he could try to decision the klitchko bros, but since he was not big at taking risk to injury or heavy shots i couldn't see that happening. plus i totally agree with norman

AA12170560	Given these 2 choices only, I have to laugh at the answers.    A spread offense is EASY to defend against and can be reacted to quickly. Greater gaps in the offense and more receivers (which means less blockers) may "spread" the LOS across the field -   but keep in mind...Defense still has an identified Point of Attack and a given number of attackers against blockers.    To me...  thinking "spread" is best is not just stupid...but funny.  Quarters defense, 3-4, Nickle D...shoot...a 4-4 stack with a great DB compliment works against a spread. Spread offense is tantamount to trick, offensive play. It's ONE thing, an offense can do to create opportunity...especially towards the end of a game when exhausted Defense players are pinching the LOS    Run and Shoot - if employed in a West Coast Offense manner (West Coast coming from a failed RNS) and kept tight...could be devastating.  The basic RNS concept is that 4 yards per play gains a 1st down every time. Fine idea until the ball is taken away or the offense suffers a huge yardage loss.  WC Offense is that PLUS the idea of total field control/ball control...  passing to the sidelines and away from defenders zone limits.    By the way, "Spread" is NOT a hybrid of Run and Shoot.    And READING Defensive coverage and adjusting on the fly is not indicative of ANY particular offense...it's what receivers may do every play.  There are only two types of coverage...man and zone...  those things in between are designed to trick receivers so they CAN'T read "on the fly" or fool the quarterback into thinking their'll be a blitz attempt.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	The spread offense is better. The run n shoot has already been tried in the NFL with the Oilers, Falcons and to a degree the Lions back in the late 80's. It was an utter failure for the Falcons and Lions. The Oilers had some success with it with Warren Moon at QB. Defenses were able to stop it before it spread too far through the league.|`|IrnHxv0iaa	The spread because run and shoot could almost always be stopped if they used the right type of zone coverage as long as they were not all going out far.|`|1gPJO37qaa	Spread offense is very hard to defend but you have to have a very good QB, an even better O line that can pass block, and good recievers.    Run n Shoot you can get away with having a below than average atheletes because its short, safe routes    I would perfer spread but it depends on the team|`|WTCvm1ufaa	I will take the spread. With the new spread offenses, you have a lot more versatility. The old Run N' Shoot was very basic in terms of X's and O's. there were only a couple of formations that stayed true to the offensive philosophy. The reason it was so successful at Houston was because there were virtually no teams back then that passed the ball so many times in a game. Besides, it was easily stopped by good defenses.     The spread passing game is more powerful in the fact that it is easier to coach. The routes are easier for the recievers to run, and for the QB to throw. It does not take a good QB to play the spread (Harrell, Brennan), who as we all know, will fail in the NFL. Even with these less talented players, offenses have looked so powerful. The running game seems to be a bit better in the spread passing attack than it was in the Run N' Shoot. Guys like Tony Temple and Derrick Washington have had 1000 yard seasons at Mizzou.      That said, i do not like either style of offense. I love QB's that drop back, and recievers that run precise routes. You also need a power running game, which either offense does not provide.|`|AzWah6Nhaa	The Run N' Shoot.

n2O0NwR6aa	Well, for a beginner, who takes an hour-long class once a week, the cost is around $60 a month.  That breaks down to about $15 an hour.  However, if a gym charged that same rate to a competitive gymnast, who works out 36 hours a week, they'd be paying over $2000 a month.  And very few people could afford that.  So gyms scale down their tuition to make it affordable; the more you go, the less you pay per hour.  But it's still expensive - for the amount of time your sisters are going, your parents are probably paying around $500 a month for each girl.  And that's just for tuition.   If your sisters compete, they probably pay and additional $3000-4000 a year (each) for meet fees, travel expenses, floor music, choreography, team leotard & warmups - plus grips, tape, workout leos, trips to the doctor, etc.  Likely a total of close to $10,000 a year - for each sister.  So yeah, you're right - gymnastics costs a bundle!|`|WRRDk6veaa	At my gym, we do sessions, which are eight weeks of gymnastics, one hour a week. That costs $140 a session, which is about $17.50 per hour.|`|UtTsZgQOaa	Depends on where you go. General gymnastics schools will probably charge $50-100 a month, more or less depending on frequency of classes, available equipment, number of instructors, if they're funded by donations, grants/loans/etc or private parties and numerous other factors.|`|yY9ea39kaa	Around     rec-60----------------------------------... a month
uF31S9Dqaa	Given the economy, this will probably be a pretty tough venture. We've discussed it on the team I play on, and it never has gained much traction. But some things to consider:    -What value will the sponsor get in exchange for their financial investment?    -Assuming you're going with some kind of ad, how many eyes will see those ads? How many of them will patronize that business and help the owner recoup his investment and make a profit?    -If this is a feel good sponsorship, what is the feel good angle?    Remember that if you are promising signage at your games, some fields may have rules that prohibit you from hanging banners or putting up ads, so don't commit to that until you know the rules of where you'll be playing. Also - be honest about how many people come to your games and how many eyes are seeing the ad.    Something you should do if you find a sponsor - create an end-of-season recap package that includes photos and documentation of what their sponsorship got them and how it hopefully helped their business.    Remember - just because you land a sponsor doesn't mean that's all that goes into the process. Most likely they'll want some updates as to how the team is doing and they will want to see that their sponsorship is getting them some sort of benefit - which ultimately means more sales and dollars in the register.    Best of luck - and good luck with your upcoming season!|`|V03f8tmMaa	Just go to a local hardware store or resturant and just ask the manager if they want to sponser your baseball team|`|e8mnEw1taa	go to local scores and ask the manager of the business to see if they are intereasted in sponsoring your team. thats what my team did. we were sponsored by dicks and pepsi max!

People can start getting hyped up if they want to, when it's all said and done tonight, Roddick will lose for the 16th time to Roger Federer.     Sorry Roddick Fans!!!

l5V76duIaa	The franchise tag protects the team from having a key player walk away from the team. For example: Lebron James is the key player for the cavaliers. and in a few years, he will probably just leave the team, with the team getting nothing in return. If the NBA had a franchise tag, the cavs could tag him and pay him the average of the top 5 players in his position and keep him around for another year. The team also would have the option of trading him so they dont end up empty handed. the franchise tag also helps the player because they get paid the average of the top 5 at their position which isnt bad|`|nlKg1g4Jaa	ask the players union .they are the ones whom wanted it.<br>  It would promise the players a fair pay ,until some teams started paying players really stupid salary's that were in free agency.The players tagged were ending up not the top players in their position,now it seems the tag backfired on them.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	To keep a player.  Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  Take a player like Peppers.  He doesn't want to play for Carolina anymore, so they would lose him with no compensation.  By tagging him, he's SOL and has no options.  I mean, yeah, he can sign elsewhere, but who is gonna take a chance that if the offer isnt matched, they have to give 2 first round picks.|`|S71lfad2aa	It's to keep one player on your team.  And if another team signs that player that you franchised then the other team has to give your team two first round picks.

K5AeQuSNaa	A hunting license does nothing to change the state laws on buying a hand gun.  The other poster gave you the link to the DFG website.  That has all the rules and regs there.  If you want to hunt with a pistol, as long as you are with an adult, you can.  There is one other little know trick to getting a handgun in California.  If you are over 18 years old, you can have a family member give you one legally.  Look at the CA Department of Justice for the Interfamilial Firearms Transfer form.  Or something like that.  You have them buy the gun, and fill out the form.  Then you go to a gun store and do a Private Party Transfer.  The handgun is then legally yours, and you can do anything with it that somebody over 21 would be able to do with it.  Unfortunately, you can't buy handgun ammunition until you are 21 either...|`|afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	All hunting regulations for CA are listed at the link below.  http://www.dfg.ca.gov/regulations/08-09-...|`|1hcArEOUaa	All so check with the state about whiter you need to complete a hunters safety course before applying for a license.Many states now require a hunters safety course completion before the will sale you a license.

You can't even tell exactly what all gadgets & gee-gaws have been hung all over it.  Most of this can be determined by the 30+ round magazine and the overly long CAR-type flash suppressor, the few details completely visible.

hCaotAlCaa	I don't know about areas south of the PA border, but take a look at Jack Frost Mountain in the Poconos.  I always recommend it for people in this area (Philly) who have not skied before.  It is probably about a four or five hour drive from DC, so it might be a bit outside your preferred range.    Here are the reasons:    Impeccable grooming.  They do an incredible job, better than just about anywhere.    Their trail lay out is simple.  As you face the trails (the lodge is at the top), the easiest ones are on the left, and as you work to the right, they get progressively more challenging.  The school slope is at the extreme left, right in front of the rental shop.      The lift on the school slope (the "bunny hill") is nice and slow, and only beginners will be on it.  A more experienced skier would become impatient but the lifts can be intimidating to a new skier.      They have enough challenging terrain there that anyone could be kept interested, but they make their money on beginner and intermediate skiers so they really cater to them.    Have fun!|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	Try Ski Liberty, Roundtop, or Whitetail, all of which are in PA, and not too far from DC at all.  Liberty has a great beginners program with lessons, lift tickets, and equipment rental for under $80.|`|4RTKq5t4aa	Wintergreen,Virginia
xOReEw6Waa	They do work but you still have to go and shoot the weapon, and I really don't think they are designed for pistols anyway. Even with a rifle it is just as easy to visually boresight in at 50 yards to start and get on paper, adjust and then work for zero at your preferred range (I sight for zero at 200 yards). So, they work but their usefulness isn't as great as I thought it would be when I've used them. I really don't see the need for them after using them and I wouldn't invest in one.|`|21bef845536547868b0d688917f58277aa	They do work for rifles, especially those that go into the barrel.  As for your pistol, I think you are talking about lazer sight the kind that shoot out red light.  I personally don't have one but was told they are dead on.|`|AA10131764	I got a cheap Chinese one in the shape of a cartridge for my AR 15 rifle as an aid to zeroing my sights and therefore save time and ammo when actually verifying true zero from live fire when I go to the range.  For that purpose, it was useful for the price because it got me very close at 50 yards.  The problem was that the max range was 50 yards and seeing the red dot at that range, unless used in dim light or at dusk in the outdoors.  It would be immensely helpful too if you had a Ransom rest for your pistol.|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	Ive shot several different kinds of pistols with laser sights.  They work well if you want a quick shot on something.  Its hard to get a handgun to be completely accurate with a laser sight, but say youre shooting at a chest size target with one, as soon as the laser hits dead center and you fire, chances are the bullet will end up hitting some location close to where the laser was.  If youre putting it on a .40 cal handgun wanting quick aim for personal defense, its worth it.  If youre going to shoot targets and want dead accuracy the sights would be better.|`|cobI4JIzaa	myself,i don't think they are worth the money. not that there is any thing wrong with them,its just that you once you have a gun bore sighted,you don't have a use for it any more.i have 30+ rifles and i bore sighted them all by eye(by removing the bolt and lining the center of bore with the cross hairs). any way it seems to me your asking about a laser sight...and not a bore sight.

If it's a fight, it's real.    "real fight" is  term mostly used by Internet warriors to push the belief they are unbelievably tough and can handle situations you'd never dare imagine. Mostly, a "real fight" is a situation where you can give yourself the permission to ignore all social rules, including laws, because this time, it's for real.    Know this: 50 percent of people who get involved in one-on-one fighting will lose. And no amount of training will guarantee you'll win, because there's always somebody out there who's been training harder than you.    The good news is you seem to be a decent person with a head on your shoulders. So chances are you will never have to worry about real fights, because you don't go out looking for them. Many people (especially on M.A. forums) don't seem to have a clue what the difference between fighting and self-defense is. Self-defense doesn't involve long confrontation or attempts to demonstrate one's skill. And if you're fighting, you're a willing participant.|`|ZWVQEhSdaa	1. work out.    -every day do 10 push ups in the morning and at night.  - do crunches to strengthen your core    2. breath    -when your punch, kick, block, grab, dodge, etc you need to breath. this will increase your speed and power. (trust me)     3. practice    - practice punching and set up moves to do, pretend one of your parents is the kid that pisses you off at school.     if you do all this i guarantee you will see a result of some sort. it takes time though.    if you are interested any more or would like more advice email me at scarfacewiiman@yahoo.com|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Best way to know is by doing training in it.    Find Martial Art school that uses proper sparring as part of their curriculum. NEVER JOIN a school that only do touch sparring or point sparring.    If you don't want to join a school yet for whatever reason, I suggest buy one of those wavemaster punching bag, and punching it. See fighting clips of MMA fighters and find a style of punching that suit you best.  Condition your knuckles by practising and also practice your kicks, starting with low kicks first, conditioning your shin.    A lot about Martial Art is also muscle memory. The more you practice the more comfortable you are with the moves.    Capoeira is a very athletic sport that requires flexibility and strength, but in my opinion, offer very little in term of realistic usage in a fight other than the fact that the practitioners will be much more fit than average people.    My suggestion of the school of Martial Art for you will be to take BJJ and Muay Thai.|`|v1mbL56caa	No one can answer that. Train hard. Train realistic. You will only know when the time comes.

Its all about Functional strength not just lifting weight. practice rotating fully into punches and accuracy. if I've learned anything its that   the hardest punches won't do anything if you don't hit the right spots.     even the semi strong strikes will drop a guy if you find his "button".    the jaw, the nose, right behind the ear will destroy someones equilibrium, leaving them dizzy and disorented. pinching weight plates will help your grip. reflexes come with sparring practicing timing and movement.|`|AA11626392	First off I would not really be too concerned about getting into a fight and least of all winning or losing.  Focus on fitness, improving your well being, helping others and most of all having fun in class.  You will be much further ahead.    If you want to improve your skills you will need to join a club and spar.  Get into a fight, take a hit, get beat up and give a few beatings.      I personally like to spar anyone that has many more years of experience then I, bigger, faster or stronger.  Especially if I feel intimidated by someone I'm going ask them to spar with me.  Getting rocked is the most effective way to learn in my opinion.    Know this your moves will not be effective if your are not conditioned to execute them.  Spar someone who has more experience than you and do it after you are exhausted.  You will learn a lot about yourself and improve your skills quickly.|`|lcTR9vLMaa	If you really want to learn, I would reccomend a muay thai class, this is probably the most effective in a street style fight.  I doubt you will be on the gorund trying to apply an armbar.  Because in a street fight there are no rules. and if you winning, Ur probably going to get bitten to release pressure. SO muay thai is my reccomendation, quick effectice hard strinking.|`|H9Raobbzaa	As long as you're breathing you have a chance in a real fight.  A pit bull usually wins becasue it refuses to give up.  To improve your striking and kicking power train on a heavy bag and keep your knees and elbows bent and elbows close to your body.  Use your hips not your arms for power.  Strike only vulnerable spots, and don't waste a single strike or kick on an area that isn't easily injured.  The element of surprise is important, and there is no such thing as a fair fight.  When you unwind don't save your punches for tomarrow un - load as soon as possible!|`|19TupZ8Naa	By "Real Fight" I'm assuming you mean a street fight. My advice for such a fight is simple.    Cheat.    Practicing martial arts helps a lot, but in a true fight where your life very well maybe in danger you can cheat. REASONABLE FORCE. You have the right to use whatever trick you need to if your life is in danger. Don't worry about being called a "coward" or a "*****" It's better then being the next name in the obituaries. The eyes, neck, and groin are all targets. They have been since ancient times. If you are only training a martial art to defend yourself from serious danger, I suggest you train in Kina Mutai, the art of Biting and Eye-gouging. One of my favorite attacks in a serious fight is the headbutt. Slamming your forehead into your enemies face of sternum will hurt them a lot. The cranium is one of your strongest areas. I have also been know to stomp on peoples feet. The pain of having a 240 pound fighter stomp on your foot full force then follow it up by elbowing you in the face is extremely damaging.    Yell    Be as loud as possible. Act as crazy as possible. Attract as much attention as possible. If you can psyche them out you have a much better chance of winning. If you are convincing enough and your opponent thinks that you may be the only one walking away today, he might very well lose his will to fight.    Use a weapon    Depending on the situation using a weapon is justifiable. I carry 3 knives with me at all times. I've only had to use them once. Other times I make use of less lethal weapons. A rock is pushing it, but if you don't have any other options it works well. If you are on the beach or near a playground, tossing sand in someones eyes helps substantially. There are also much simpler tools you can use. I once had someone use a trash can lid on me in a practice street fight sparing match. I've found an effective weapon in something everyone has. My keys. Holding the bladed edge of your key out and placing it between your fingers is like a mini razor blade. With enough force behind it, it can cause serious damage.    Run    If it looks like you are out matched or out numbered. There is no shame in a tactical retreat. Run fast and hard towards crowds of people. They will slow down your enemies or possibly even help. Muggers do not like to draw extra attention to themselves and the possibility of being arrested are all things that will demotivate them to want to continue fighting. When making your escape, use shields. By shields I mean knock over a fruit stand, run through a parking lot, or a narrow stairwell. Hotels are the ideal place to escape your pursuers in. A narrow stairwell in a hotel can usually only fit 2 people side by side. If you knock them over, they may very well take the rest of your enemies with you.    If the situation warrants it. Choke people to sleep and break bones. Your life is you're most important possession, and protecting it is crucial in a fight.

Man gets up, runs up to you, proceed to kick him in the stomach, flip him the bird, give him a Stunner.    4. By this point, Woman should be either a) charging toward you with a knife or b) on her knees in the bed screaming, trying to cover up her bare essentials. In either case, proceed to surprise her with the always awesome to watch RKO. She'll never see it coming.    5. Go back home and wait for the inevitable visit from the police. This part is important, for added realism (since of course, wrestling is fake, but you have to sell it): Beat up a couple of the cops, but eventually let them escort you out of the building in handcuffs.

Vjan4Vq2aa	I wouldn't call them wimps. They actually have to have way more physical endurance and strength than basketball players because they run nonstop for 90 minutes. They're much faster too.

by7BQ2npaa	It is true that the singles skaters did go through a qualifying preliminary round where they must each skate their long program.  However, I believe starting in 2007, the ISU had eliminated this format and instead allowed the competition to start right from the short/technical program. So that means everyone, around 30+ skaters would be able to compete, but after the short programs have been skated, the list would be trimmed down to around 24 skaters who qualify to go on to the long program.  In other words, the short program is now like an elimination round now.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	I  went to the Worlds in 2006. Every skater skated their LONG program in the preliminary rounds (which you never seeon TV). It goes on for HOURS. Then the top 24 or 30, whatever, competed in the short and long. Now I can't say that it's the same for Olympics but it could be. It's still the ISU running things.

I have a season ticket and bought my son one as well. If the FA repeatedly gave out cheap tickets it would become cheaper for fans to pick and choose the games they went to. This would either stop people buying season tickets or just seriously annoy them. I know that having paid full price for a full season I would be annoyed if part-time/fair-weather spectators were given better discounts.    I think the FAs should butt out and leave the clubs to initiate their own kids pricing structure and invest in their own future. Middlesbrough have done it this year with the introduction of 95 season tickets for all under 18s anywhere in the ground.

cKDralDHaa	Favorite: The Undertaker       - He became my favorite mainly because of his appearance and in-ring style. Back when he first came out and I saw him debut Survivor Series, I was like "damn" At the time he was one of the biggest guys on the roster, and the whole 'dead man' thing was awesome. The Undertaker was like 6'10'' and probably about 300 pounds at the time. But he wasn't fat or overweight, it was actual muscle. Not only that but he completely manhandled the competition, almost single handidly demolishing the Hart Foundation during that match. The Tombstone was gold.       Not only that but The Undertaker introduced alot of cool Gimmick matches into the WWF. Whether or not he actually thought them up I don't know for sure but they are usually regarded as his. The Buried Alive, the ....what was it called where you put your opponent in a Herse and drive away and I'm fairly sure the Hell in a Cell was his too.  The Undertaker's precense sold so well with his opponents too, they were actually scared of him, and who wouldn't be. All the things he did, I remember her tied Stephanie to a Black Cross and tried to marry her. Who does things like that? lol      Then he left and I was a bit let down cus he was one of my favorite wrestlers of all time. Then he came back at Judgment Day as the American Badass, I was shocked because I don't read spoilers (ruins the surprise) so I didn't know he'd be there. I was like, "gaodamn" I mean they took the most badass wrestler, gave him a trench coat and put him on a Motorcycle. And people can argue that the Biker gimmick has been done to death over wrestling history especially with guys like Diesel (aka Kevin Nash) but I don't care, in my opinion Taker pulled it off the best. Even when he became a Heel as Deadman Inc. I still thought he was the best. "Just shut up and fight" A better motto was never uttered. He'd just walk around and beat down people for no good reason...awesome.      Then there was the Brothers of Destruction. Kane and American Badass Undertaker. They were no better team in the whole Company. Then Kane kind of crapped on it by turning on him.      Undertaker came back reprising his role as the Deadman and while I had grown to 'love' the Biker gimmick it was good seeing him back regardless. The Undertaker demolished those who went up against him and always made it look cool.      Deadman, American Badass, Deadman Inc, The Phenom. You could put Mark in a clown suit as evil Doink meets Joker and I'd still think he was the best Superstar ever. I mean The Undertaker's popularity has gotten him so over with the fans he has to be a future Hall of Famer.....no. He is an Icon, a whole Chapter in the book of Wrestling. In my view with his standing with the fans, the Undertaker is actually higher up on the ladder then the WWE Championship belt. With it or without it he's still the man.|`|g1Zu5UTRaa	randy orton coz of his sik *** RKO|`|iaZewr3waa	Brock Lesnar, he was a true wrestler and a good actor. He was a dominant powerhouse and champion, plus he played the role of a heel (bad guy) very well. He was probably the only TRUE athlete like Kurt Angle, but was miles better in my opinion. He was big and stronger than every single heavyweight in the WWE roster, and was just as quick and agile as a light-heavyweight. Hell, he even did what some CRUISERweights like Rey Mysterio couldn't do: he could do shooting stars off the top rope. I can't explain in words the athleticism and sheer power of Brock. He can fight for REAL too, he's UFC Heavyweight Champion now and he's only been in the UFC for less than a year! The guy played football for a short time with the Minnesota Vikings. He won NCAA championships and was an All American Wrestling Champion.    People mistake his confidence as *********. He isn't a cocky person, he is just confident of himself, and that confidence has helped him achieve what he has. If he was cocky, he would've gotten his **** handed to him by those UFC veterans, but no, they didn't.    I'm talking too much about the UFC, but even when he just performed in the WWE, he was a true athlete, a true wrestler and a true performer. Maybe he's not a fan person, he's just focused on what he does best: fight, and there's nothing wrong with that. He's a focused, determined, hard-working person.    His workmanship inspires me when I train in rugby and when I practice my karate.|`|mWXKwjf4aa	Chris Jericho.    His ability play both face and heel so convincingly well is amazing.

His in ring skills are also great.|`|PHoyqLN9aa	Lex Luger because he slammed Yokozuna.|`|MYMpCrEYaa	jeff hardy cause i love highflyers and risktakers|`|9l0OXv9uaa	this is tricky for me, i dont realy have a single favourite anything. my favourite wrestlers are Orton, Edge and RVD.    Orton because hes just the perfect image of what a superstar should be, and at his age he has a long career left to come. his sick finishers and the amount of counters he uses for the RKO are amazing, still cant get over the twist of fate counter, apsolutely priceless.    Edge because realy most people dont see past his heel attitude which hes had for the last few years and realy he is realy realy talented. hes like a mirror image of Orton, a perfect superstar. and the spear which he has been using since day one has come a long way and he can realy do some crazy things with it in the right situations.    RVD because despite the fact that hes nearly 40 he can still do everything he could 15 years ago AND MORE. the ultimate definition of high risk, stunt wrestling. i could watch that guy all day long because you realy just dont know what hel do next, with guys like Undertaker, Orton, Jericho, everyone, they all have these sort of key interlocking combos that they do, but RVD just pulls everything out of knowhere! probably the most unpredictable guy to watch and thats why hes so exciting. thats why hes one of my favourites.    COME BACK ROB!|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	jack swagger because i like his *********|`|0NNEJXJPaa	Top ten moves of Takuya Sugi    Because he is so good, and he is not a talentless bastard like John Cena, who gets it all. I don't care if you are racist, or you like a wrestler because they went from nothing to TNAWWFWCWECW World Undisputed Universal Title, anyone can do that, but do your ric flairs and Buddy Rogers, go thru what Japanese wrestlers do, or what even japanese kids do, have you experienced this, the years of straight jamming information into their heads. And don;t tell me Sting is a legend and he's dedeicated, what doi you mean dedicated, anyone would keep wrestling if they got millions of bucks and be loved so much.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	RVD became my favorite because of his unique high-flying ring-style.  Nobody else wrestles like RVD; he is truly "one of a kind".|`|XEGBUFwAaa	Chris Benoit     When I started watching WCW in the late 90's I always wated for Benoit's matches. He knife-edge chops & suplexes made wrestling "look real to me".  And I was always a fan of his.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	AJ Styles is mine..How did I get to like him? I watched one of his matches..that's all it took..|`|Be6HpTuoaa	john cena for being a thug and funny at the same time|`|rs7fuvPxaa	well my favourite wrestler is jericho I really started to like him from his funny gimmick and his mic skills I also like The Rock for his mic skills so its probably that|`|5JQFCQCkaa	I liked his lack of style and overall viciousness.|`|pwOz69qfaa	Now My favorite is Edge.I like him since first time i watch WWE and because his gimmick,ability,and mic skill|`|cj8iM1Olaa	Randy Orton    I started to like him right around the breakup of Evolution, a little bit before he beat Benoit for the title.|`|6d0250ca8941e47460eda0499a69b2caaa	My favorite wrestler is TRIPLE H ,and i started liking him, because he is funny,good mic skills, I love his move the PEDIGREEand i like it when he uses the sledgehammer.  He is also so hot.|`|vyHwhACjaa	Well my favourite wrestler is Chris Jericho. I had seen small doses of him in WCW, but the show wasn't widely available here in the UK so I continued to watch WWF and supported Shawn Michaels. Then WCW/NWO Revenge came out on the N64 and I started playing as Jericho because I loved his move set. Finally, in 1999, I had stayed up late to watch Raw and to my surprise (the days before I read spoilers), Jericho debuted. It was the best debut ever, and the rest is history =)|`|l6g3moiEaa	Triple H before he got the messed up knees was the frickin man! I seriously haven't seen a wrestler I could get behind completely since those days. Not only was he the most vile and evil sumbitch in wrestling, he always had a plan for how to win and keep his title, whether it was through sheer brutality (like the numerous sledgehammer shots) or cunning (like building up D-X or Evolution around him for defense). So many awesome moments, how could I choose just one? Just eeeeevil.... *pinky to bottom lip*|`|N1JFX1yGaa	STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN    He had the best feuds and storylines back in the WWF and the style.  Wether it was his " I Don't give a ****:" attitude or being the toughest SOB in the WWF/E.    I always admired him when i was a kid and his entrances just gave me chills, when he walked out into that ring and the crowd went nuts. He was a good champion and he didn't need anyone to fight his battles for him.    He could play a heel very well and the crowd would still admire is credibility.    And no one could forget about his very famous catch phrases   Austin 3:16 just said i whipped your a**"  GIVE ME A HELLL YEAH!"  THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE CAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO"  What?    That's why Austin 3:16 is and will always be my favourite|`|gfeVkkHNaa	Kane because of the red and black outfit especially back when I was a kid I always admire and it gave me the Goosebumps every-time I saw his awesome mask.
Mi3rHjcYaa	well Kobe's not a Role player...I would say Robert Horry no doubt. How many GW 3-pointers has he hit in the last 10 years?|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	My opinion is Ben Wallace 4 D.O.Y and still defending great  for the Cavaliers|`|LdIgg7yTaa	My vote goes to Robert Horry.|`|YwpKrQOsaa	Bruce Bowen|`|y8qGjcZyaa	I would have to say Derek Fisher but Robert Horry deserves a mention|`|H8FHx1HYaa	kobe no doubt|`|cxsBo2yqaa	Barbosa  Posey  Mourning|`|UaSFuT59aa	What a surprise. Someone answered a question with Kobe lol. And it was about role players. I think the most consistent and winning role player is derek fisher.    EDIT: To you youngsters answering this question with Kobe, a role player is a player that plays a SUPPORTING role to the stars and does the little things to help the team win. It doesn't mean the "player" that is a "role" model to you. What do they teach you kids in school nowadays?|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Well for one thing, in order to have been the most solid role player for the last 10 years I would think the player has to have played for at least 10 years.    i would say either Derek Fisher or Bobby Jackson.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	MANU GINOBILI.... SRSLY... he's not the starter...yet gives ridiculous number of firepower off the bench.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	tim duncan no doubt!    4 rings? 2 MVP?    any questions?|`|ctraoPNMaa	Ben Graham|`|YTLlMdhDaa	Robert Horry.

They're solid players that come off the bench and play consistent 6th man minutes.  Although Chicago is not a winning team like that of San Antonio, I give both these guys credit being able to play at a high level and not being the "franchise" player.    San Antonio's Duncan and Parker.  Chicago's Deng and now Rose.|`|PHoyqLN9aa	Definitely Jerry Stackhouse|`|KdhNCnEjaa	James Posey by a mile, Kobe? I hope your kidding
6nY99hPmaa	Matt Morgan no doubt.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Morgan is younger and faster than Kane so Morgan would win it|`|7rpILeYtaa	The Blueprint|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Matt would win.   (:|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	morgan|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Kane|`|fv2GAAdPaa	The Blueprint|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Kane just slightly..|`|lzbxT6p9aa	I think that the Kane of nowadays would get squashed by The Blueprint Matt Morgan. He's basically used a jobber these days. He lost to Kofi Kingston on Raw for Fu*k's sake! The Blueprint, however, is just getting his momentum going and will be a top draw for a long time to come.     It would be a better matchup if it was "Masked" Kane -vs- Matt Morgan.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Kane would decimate him.|`|l6g3moiEaa	Kane COULD win, but they'd probably give the win to Morgan. WWE hasn't exactly been kind to the Big Red Machine lately.|`|XulcYwOnaa	the DNA of TNA, Matt Morgan|`|Ku6KlZ3faa	Kane, because he would job to anybody.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Kane is an okay worker for guy his size, and Morgan just flat out sucks, Kane has better charisma as well. Kane wins this on.|`|mmUrI8hMaa	If it was Kane back in his masked years, when WWE actually put him to good use, he would step over Matt Morgan with ease. But nowadays Kane loses to anybody, so I'd say Matt Morgan for sure.|`|xnhBucrjaa	i think kane would win. but just barely. that would be a really good match though.
LUnscegvaa	I would'nt do that throw from a bear hug ..is it overarm or underarm.    There are more effective counters even at beginners level.    Best wishes :)***|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there    So so many factors involved here to give you a simple answer! Things like their height and weight as well as how the bear hug hold is applied? Are their arms around your arms or just your waist? Its more of a question of how you would take their balance that determines the kind of throw you would do? Forcing round pegs into square holes simply wont work no matter how compitent you are.    Best wishes    idai|`|19TupZ8Naa	I'm not an expert on Japanese Jujitsu, but it really depends on your opponent's height. If they are too tall for you to wrench their arm with your knees bent you shout probably stand straight. I personally have always bent my right knee and ended in a crouching position. I know the throw damage is a lot less, but it makes it easier for me to go for a submission.
mMFJrPbvaa	If the "red paint comes off" and you lose grip then your football isn't made of real leather.  Its probably a synthetic leather or at the least a very poor quality leather.  I have played football in downpours and in the snow....with the same football and it has never peeled or lost its grip. (yea it gets slippery when its wet or hard when its freezing out but the grip remains there on the ball)  It`s a Genuine leather football...that we have been using for about 3 years now of heavy use.  Don't get me wrong its not like brand new its beat up and what not but it has peeled or lost its grip.  Plus you use the laces to throw the ball so that shouldn't be a problem.|`|jto3YOQJaa	i like football and i think that although the paint serves as a means of grip, i think that i use the stitching more.|`|XOnk1rBcaa	What?
a6EndAPiaa	Do not do it.  It is illegal if you get caught you will end up in jail it is just not worth the risk.|`|c37428f3fbea3315c20ba2ba639993b2aa	yes,,, dont do it...if you really want to race...do it where the environment is controlled...like say a race track...|`|9CJeXKkBaa	well the only tip is don't get trick on people trying to cheat you out your money make sure you guys have a place where both sides of your friends are waiting at the end of the finish line.|`|XdlHEA5qaa	Why not take it to a track where you win prize money and parts, plus you can get sponsorships that will buy you car parts?  Street racing gets people killed.|`|HXO2vUcIaa	LOL @ the fnf fanboy here......yea dude street racing is all about nos man thats all you need is just more nos...nos= respect and women man....but no seriously dude take it to a track a track day is less then the tickets and impoundment of your car....and trust me your jackass friend might think your cool but no real car enthusiast likes you
N1JFX1yGaa	I would say Terry Funk Vs Sabu in a Barb wire match.. this match was so crazy and dangerous that Paul Heyman never wanted to people to fight in a match like this ever again.    It had tons of great moments and was far away from boring  Sabu taped his wounds up and Funk showed that he was the man    If you havent seen this match then go check it out because it was one match i would never forget.|`|uaMQNJPoaa	tommy dreamer vs hardcore holly|`|7rpILeYtaa	Scaffold Match  Tommy Dreamer vs Brian Lee  High Incident, 10/26/96|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I don't know about an ECW match.

N5SVU6Xwaa	work on sub defense and throw and mount him|`|C0sT0PPyaa	if some guy tried to break my arm or choke me, id be forced to kill him.  just letting you know.  and a bjj blue would destroy you.  id go to his instructor and ask him if street fighting and bullying is his philosophy|`|p9RQcqNzaa	you have height and weight advantage so you can use that to your advantage. use your throws, if it hits the ground keep moving and dont slow down and give him time to react. bjj guys have a hard time with aggresive wreslters.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Well if he decides to fight you sprawl and get away. If he pulls guard use your judo submission defense and wrestling base and core strength of both to posture up. get bicep control and stand up then get the hell out of there then file a assault charges.    I suggest you go to the school principal and talk to them.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Talk to the principal about this bully.  Don't take his stuff and don't get into a fight with him.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Since you're a judoka, ask him to fight in a more realistic place like the paved parking lot, where it will really hurt if you manage to throw him down and slam him if he tried to pull you into guard.    BJJ will have tremendous advantage fighting on soft area where the practitioner could jump and pull guard not afraid of really being slammed or even getting hip thrown by a judoka since they will drop on a softer surface that will minimize the damage anyway.    And one thing, do not be afraid of his ground game. Just shoot first since you're a wrestler, stay on top and GnP him, I doubt he has developed the kind of muscles that professional UFC fighters have. Meaning that there are more spots to hit, in UFC short punches to mid section and rib area are not that effective since the fighters have developed enough muscles to deflect the damage there.  More likely than not, several well placed short punches and knees on that guy's rib will finish the fight.|`|M9e8ilbiaa	Maybe you should pray first...    Just make a thing: forget your judo and wrestling and go for punches and low kicks. Avoid close combat, because as soon as you get caught, you are going to be taken down, and then choked. Unless you are a pussy, avoid talk to the pincipal.|`|ahOk4C0saa	dont get too close, bjj fighters hve magnets that pull you so u cant get away. ya gotta stick and move use the jab and pack a lunch sounds like a hard days work. hit him as hard as you can in the chest so he cant breathe then punt his head like football that will give you an edge in the fight|`|19TupZ8Naa	You won't beat him on the ground. Jiujitsu can be both defensive or very aggressive. The first time I fought a judoka it was pretty easy since they took it to the ground, it's a big mistake to try and one-up a BJJ fighter on the ground.     I would try to fight him standing up. I find that the Guillotine is one of the most effective and practical techniques you can throw at someone. There are just endless openings. Just standard stand-up fighting is very effective. The average BJJ fighter will always try to take the fight to the ground, don't let him.    Also, since you outweigh him. Throw some hard low-kicks. He won't expect them and low kicks from a guy who has 50 pounds on you will hurt. If you can keep him out of range; I would. That's how I lost my first fight against a Tae Kwon Do practitioner. He threw a ton of low-kicks and a few head and chest shots. When I sprawled or got up close, he did his best to escape. Eventually I got tired out and took quit a bit of damage; including multiple fractures to 3 of my fingers from a bad block. You'd be surprised how often you screw up when there is a guy throwing a bunch of fast kicks at you. That was one of the 2 times in my life I got KO'd.(More of a Flash KO, but they marked it as KO.)    Also the seriousness of how you fight him depends on the nature of the challenge. If it's a "Dude we should spar sometime." or "What-u-faka-u-like-scrap!?" or "I'M GONNA KILL YOU!" should influence how seriously you respond in a fight. If it's a bully who just wants to fight you because you piss him off or he wants to act cool. Then I'd just ignore him until he starts something. I did that for most of High School. Sure, I got into a few fights; won some and lost some, I really wish I could of avoided them all though. It's not about being a "*****" it's about discipline, but when a fight starts, make sure you do whatever it takes to be the one who walks away from it when the dust settles.    People who train in BJJ for the sake of fighting people(not including competitions) are a stain on the Martial arts community.|`|wphUIz0naa	You mma people are so "ring" minded.  Good luck fighting by rules that don't apply.|`|5Dlefu2Eaa	If you are being serious and you are in high school you make sure you don't get into any kind of fight unless you are standing on pavement.  Really you should do anything you can to not get into a fight.  If you do Judo and Wrestling (though Judo green is nothing special) you make sure you end the fight with a throw and do not follow him down.  If he just does BJJ his standup game will be terrible.    A solid ippon quality throw in a fight ender on concrete.  Remember, if he's so intent on fighting you then real fights have no rules.      Since you are in high school I doubt you are going to like any of these suggestions but I think you should bring this up to your high school principle or his BJJ instructor.  If you speak with his instructor about the situation and does nothing you can go to the local press and have them write a story about some rogue instructor allowing his students to bully others.  I doubt you will have to go that far because any instructor worth a damn will speak with the student and discipline him by not allowing him to train or other senior students at his school will teach him a lesson.  I do Judo and BJJ and this kid sounds like a bad egg....just about all of us would never tolerate such a thing.|`|MQmQTl0haa	stick a thumb in his eye once he 'pulls guard', as all BJJ students do. Then scoop the eye out. Fight over.|`|AA10182508	If you're really good in judo and you can take him down at will. Take him down and get top position and ground and pound him.   The truth is, "most" BJJ purists have difficulty handling aggressive Ground and pound. Oftentimes, they get hit too much trying to overthink their submission as you go pounding their face with elbows and punches.  You have an advantage coz' you are more massive and a wrestler. BJJ fighters often roll or spar with no hitting. It is a somewhat different dimension for them if hitting is allowed.  But don't get me wrong there are others that are well-versed in hitting as well just be aware.  Things to watch out when your on top is their legs, they may try to grab your hand and wrap their legs around your shoulder and armbar you in one swift move. Or Triangle choke you. Also, BJJ guys always go for the wrist control. Don't let them grab your wrist for too long. Always try to shake them off and attack.   If you're caught in a position you don't understand, just scramble and stand up and reset the fight standing up.  There are increasing amount of BJJ guys that got very cocky thinking they can fight and submit anyone without BJJ background. The truth is, boxers and wrestlers that can punch owns them most of the time.
0xj5VkEEaa	Need a bowler like Malinga or Vaas.can't expect more from Dilhara.  and Dilshan must strike again|`|nAISM360aa	Nope. Team batted well but could have done slightly better. Only problem was a main strike fast bowler prob Fernando instead of Mahroof but that would mean one less batsmen. I think they played well but were done by a very strong Indian batting line up.   Prob more aggreesive play from batsmen to try and get scores >280|`|gfgJUt62aa	bring few M&Ms in the team, lmao|`|AA11088802	No|`|AA11599788	Ideally, their bowling should have: Mendis, Murali, Malinga and Kulasekara. Thilan Thushara Mirando should play as an allrounder.     Sanga will play as keeper-batsman.     5 Batsmen should be: Kandamby, Udawatte, Sanath, Jehan Mubarak (or Mahela), Kaushalya Weeraratne (or Dilshan).      Jayawardene and Kapugedera are not performing. This is a big worry for them. I would suggest the replacement of Kapugedera with Weeraratne or Udawatte.    MDK Perera, Chamara Silva, Upul Tharanga and BSM Warnapura are not ODI class. They should be discarded.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	They should drop kandamby although he is performing well and give an opportunity to jehan mubarak,who is a good striker.They should drop maharoof and give the chance for Dilhara fernando.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	no, leave it the same.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	They should add Jehan Mubarak to the team as he is a very good lower order batsman.1 more reason to add him is that the current lower order is not at all that stable.You are right,they should add a pace bowler because the 2 bowlers Kulashekra and Thushara are good but not that much experienced.Jayawardene should really improve his batting otherwise it would be good to see him replaced by someone else.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	bring back Malinga or Vaas~

And the "I know more about footy than any of you" Reminds me of Jesse Dart on the footy show and Sammy didn't know the Freo players name, Jesse said "come on, you should know every number and name of every player!".    I can't wait until the footy shows back on, sucked in hutchy Kerry didn't leave!|`|hTruYNUQaa	I cant wait!!!!    Why dont you start now.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	your molly!|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Sam Newman.

qyATAaeXaa	Your best bet is to get a good pair from a dealer. It's most likely they will have to order a boot. While size 31.0 boots often can be found at great prices near the end of the season, bigger sizes aren't even usually stocked, so getting one that didn't sell will be pretty hard to do.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	I suggest you try for a pair that are closer to the proper length, like 33.0 or 33.5 in the mondo point.  The boots are based on  European sizes which number one size larger than a US boot.  I wear a 11 US but a 10 (28.0) ski boot.   You may need to have the boots stretched to fit your foot, also custom foot beds are suggested to keep your foot from moving in the boot.|`|kJcCNie0aa	most likely not, you would have to check resale stores and bidding websites, but i do not know of anywhere that sells size 16 ski boots where i live. maybe craigslist...
M8XmhqIhaa	First of all, India would never have won so many matches. Its mostly Sachin Tendulkar that wins the game for India and India is really blessed to have such a cricketer.

Brian Lara, Ponting, Kallis, Dravid would probably be fighting it out for the title of best batsmen for the last 10yrs, but Sachin is probably the best. The fact that he has been playing at international level since he was 16 and he's been captain of india and is top scorer in both forms of the game just shows what a loss it will be to cricket the day he retires.|`|t2Ns8Tcoaa	Nothing, life would go on and so would cricket.|`|7T38y6yfaa	I can assure that no one can play consistently for nearly 20years except Sachin.His play always show that he is learning every game he play.

You have to train for months before you even step into your first match, so the boxers know what they're doing. Boxing =/= beating the sh*t out of each other.

Grow a pair.|`|lOZF75iWaa	It won't happen. It would only go underground. Bare knuckle fights still take place and people choose to do it. For some, it's a way of focusing their hate and rage. Of finding life in a suppressing society that lauds and enforces death. Making a stand and saying "I am".|`|TbEwkoQDaa	I don't think boxing would be banned in the long run because before a boxer decided to enter this sport, he/she were aware of things that will happen inside the ring.  This ring is a very physical, painful sport and that's the nature of this sport.|`|fdae9c8eb3732598efe289049b2e3e65aa	hahahahahaha boxing is a game  hahahahaha    but no. it shouldnt be banned|`|9SgoJ4aDaa	YES|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Boxing is a dangerous game but the alternatives for a lot of these boxers would be worse. A lot of the fighters are usually from inner-city, poor and usually black and Latino neighborhoods. There are gangs, poor schools and terrible poverty in those streets. Boxing gives youngsters an outlet to take their anger in a controlled, safe, and regulated environment. Man by his nature is a sexual and at times aggressive physically being and he needs to conquer, to explore, to fight, and to take risks. Without boxing, Iran Barkley would still be in a street gang and although he is broke and has damage to his left eye he would probably be incarcerated at this time if he continued on his lifestyle....if not worse. In terms of violence, boxing pales in comparison to Ultimate Fighting, Pride Bushido, Mixed Martial Arts, and Pit Fighting. Boxing is a very dangerous game but the alternative of banning it because it is annoying to some people or they find it offensive is a significantly worse alternative. Sometimes using the state as the ultimate altruistic nanny to ban and censor contact sports or entertainment simply because it might create "risks" for certain people could have authoritarian, if not totalitarian, consequences.     As to your question about Mohammed Ali. His name is spelled Muhammad Ali not Mohammed Ali. Before you talk about boxing like you are some kinda expert and you are not, try to learn to spell correctly, okay? You also mention "many boxing players had brain damages." Try to remember in the sweet science it is simply called "boxers" not "boxing players." No columnist from Phil Juckett, Jim Bagg, Steve Farhood, Nigel Collins, Jeff Ryan or any one with any level of intelligence in the sport of boxing calls it "boxing player." The correct pronunciation is called, "Many boxers suffer from brain damage when their careers in the fight game are over." Try not only to learn a little bit about the sport of boxing by reading books authored by boxing scholars like Bert Randolph Sugar and Jose Torres try also to take proper grammar English writing and reading classes at your local community college, too.|`|AVTXclXqaa	Boxing isnt a game and boxers arent players little girl so get it right.

It took me month or so from when I first started doing Y!A to get my F1 TC.    If you're looking for the secret, then exceptionally detailed answers and not answering questions that only need one line answers is the way to improve your best answer %, which is one of the keys to becoming a TC. I simply don't answer random questions, and if I know that an asker either picks only best answers which agree with him (or doesn't pick best answers at all), then I don't answer their questions.  I've answered under 3000 questions in 2.5 years (comparison: Mitch, above, has answered over 3400 questions in 6 months! Not sure how he does it?), but I've given a good answer pretty much every time.

8Im1iGFTaa	He is defiantly the best wrestler now but honestly he still has a way until best ever|`|sqfjfR3iaa	He is one of the best wrestlers in World Wrestling Entertainment. Has he wrestled for other wrestling promotions in Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Canada and other countries? No. Was he an NCAA Wrestling Champion in Free-Style Wrestling? No. Was he an NCAA Wrestling Champion in Greco-Roman Wrestling? No. Does he hold any belts in any forms of Martial Arts? Does he use a lot of wrestling holds? No. Does he use a lot of submission holds? No. Do I think he is good, but has plenty of room for improvement? Yes. There are a lot of Professional Wrestlers who have some of the skills, that I cited in the first few sentences, so Randy could stand to become a much more skilled Professional Wrestler. Randy Orton and John Cena don't even enter into the conversation when you talk about skilled grapplers like Kenta, Brian Danielson, Nigel McGuinness, Keiji Muto, Kurt Angle, Taz, and Undertaker.|`|eGCWuY4raa	Sorry, but I don't agree.

That's seriously debatable. Personally, I'd rather watch Jericho, Edge, 'Taker, HBK, or even old standby Triple H (and that's just current superstars). His title reigns thus far have been nothing but snoozefests. Sure, he can spit on legends and kick old men in the head, but I need a little more before I can say he's Champion material. And he needs some serious help in choosing a stable. Rhodes and DiBiase? Those two couldn't be my backup dancers.|`|YFE3pCM6aa	Well, He's not the best ever, but he is the man. He's my favorite on Raw. So yeah... He's pretty awesome.|`|YCJKHt7Daa	It isn't hard to be better than Cena...|`|S6iJSXseaa	yes

aQLTXwUbaa	sorry to say this, but there aren't any magic exercises that can target the waist specifically.    You can do crunches, and sit ups, and trunk twists until you are blue in the face, but until the fat is reduced, you won't see those toned abs, and you won't see the skinny waist.    To really accentuate the waist, fat must be burned. The best way to do this is with sustained cardio exercise such as elliptical, step machines, jogging, or cycling.    Eating less is part of this. I recommend a diet low in carbs, and higher in protein and good oils, and unlimited fresh fruits and vegetables.

AFkjkqcSaa	Hi there  Ive been doin mixed martial arts for 14 year and boxing.  Tournaments are hard and u have to be mega fit and you need to have a recovery rate of under 5minutes in order to do this you need to do a lot of running. Its very nerve wrecking too, so you need to be quite confident.  Be prepared for black eyes and bloody nose, some moves are banned in some competitions such as; knees, elbows and head kicks which you can be disqualified for. However your coach must'nt put you in the ring if you are not confident, and remember the ring is completely different from normal sparring.|`|GutYNu9baa	I know nothing about this subject, but, Good Luck!|`|c6HfikOHaa	hi i have trained for many years for the last 2 years full time 40 hours plus a week  (that was now a couple of years ago now ) i did because i decided,to go prof i didn't in the end(i bought a bar in france)  i did bruce lees modified arts boxing, thia boxing, kickboxing, wing chun ,i also did kali, and sombo, before that i did karate and traditional wing chun i don't understand really, the thing is a 6 week coarse doesn't sound like much. Just to have a basic understanding of what your actually doing the moves, the reasons ,body mechanics ,and that's b4 you even think about speed power and cardio  whilst i don't wish to put you off i would really give it some proper thought i think you should wait for a year a martial art needs to be a reflex and not a process of thought your body and mind need to react as if you were driving a car were you do it but don't really think about it i think if you went and fought in a competition and failed it would damage you ego  try some semi contact sparring and if you like it maybe go for full contact as quite often people lose fight s because they are not used to being hit this creates a 'fight or flight' response and often you wont know until you are hit which one it'll be but i do hope you enjoy the sport embrace it for you ,worry about the competitions later|`|yvoGbxshaa	thats awesome soph saw your question I do more judo but I'll ask a few of my friends I have a buddy whose an instructor for 18 years|`|805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa	6 weeks sessions after and even at intermediate level, going into a tournament that early might not be a good idea. no one in here could say if you are really ready for this aside from your trainer, if the trainer told you your okay to go then you must be good.    i dont really know the level of difficulty with regards to kickboxing as i do amateur boxing. but i have to go thru intensive training for about a year for my first amateur bout. included in my program is cardio conditioning on initial phase after the basics.    the feeling is odd, nerve-wreaking, butterflies in the stomach. i loss my awareness of the surrounding as i focused on my opponent as far as i remember.|`|FPJSoxYwaa	Don't get ahead of yourself.

Choice 2: Merge ECW to Smackdown and RAW.like Put Miz & Morrison to RAW,Finlay to RAW,Mark Henry to SD,Swagger to SD, Ortiz to RAW,Evan Bourne to SD and Boogeyman to RAW.pretty simple. because to be honest ECW is a waste of time now.it's not even EXTREME anymore.it's boring,and it has Few Superstars.|`|P93I8CHtaa	ECW needs more superstars,how are they stuffed?|`|TbRtRvuoaa	it's probably gonna get worse soon    i'll bet if they have a draft they'll send Miz n Morrison to Raw & Smackdown    they need a few midcarders and maineventers    i'd like to see   Big Show  Vladimir Kozlov  Charlie Haas    and possibly have cruiserweights on there just to make it more valuable to watch    and a few Extreme matches a now n then|`|rs7fuvPxaa	they'll get evan bourne back soon that will make it a tiny beat more intresting but now i think ECW is just like heat|`|43a8fcbc7f3a1973d91cf4b7013a291caa	dude, grow up! stop watching wrestling, you do know its fake right? or do you still believe in santa claus|`|RxRYlOblaa	I think ECW has been boring, even when matt hardy was in it, I didn't even watch it most of the time, but things are getting interisting with the undefeated jack swagger as ecw champion, and when evan bourne comes back there would probably be a good match between Evan bourne, and Jack swagger for the title, but if RVD returned for good and he was on ECW, then EVERYONE would watch ECW.    WQ: if you mean the strongest wrestler on RAW, then its probably Batista|`|gRyo8W8Saa	yer mate matt has left.Him and jeff are gonna start a rivlary|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	They should just scrap ECW. Biggest powerhouse is Batista|`|gfeVkkHNaa	I'm pretty sure ECW isn't going to last, unless WWE does something about it real quick and I hope they do.|`|mWXKwjf4aa	No. They need to change the name from ECW when Tommy Dreamer retires, but they can still make it a decent show.    They should have the following wrestlers perform (more often) on ECW:    Dolph Ziggler  Jamie Noble  The Brian Kendrick  William Regal  Hurricane Helms  Jimmy Wang Yang  Funaki  R-Truth|`|uaMQNJPoaa	yer mate matt has left.Him and jeff are gonna start a rivlary

w9kSGLBxaa	IMO. Modern Fencing (foil, saber and epee) has very good linear foot work but poor circular. I have worked with some of the best fencers in my state and while moving straight in and out the are absolutely deadly but while circling they are out of there element. While moving in and out they are very good at controlling their center and getting others to reveal theirs.     I think that fencing has good foot work for what it is but is quite limited out side of fencing.|`|19TupZ8Naa	I'm sure it will. I've done Kendo and it's helped me with my base(balance) and with my shoot(sprawl). From what I've seen in the Olympics, Fencing focuses on footwork much more then Kendo. I would seriously consider doing it myself if I could find a place that was teaching it.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	it will help you with your footwork and timing.|`|9fsIHOIPaa	good linear but bad ciruclar because modern fencing is straight up and down a mat|`|p9RQcqNzaa	yessir, that why bruce lee learned to fence and you cant really argue with that guy

BkrC57dsaa	also think dwyane wade deserve in that spot. the way he won the title in the 2006 finals shows it and the way he played in the olympics and the way he is playing right now.|`|H8FHx1HYaa	they bought deserve|`|PCk2Cfc4aa	Dwayne Wade is awesome but Kobe just seems better|`|4DcvpQXfaa	yes he deserves it,but only if he can beat kobe!|`|1nIdoB0paa	No because Kobe is much better than Wade in many ways.

Wade is the life of the Heat without him they will be the same or maybe worse than last year. Wade is doing better statistically than Kobe but he needs to get his team to keep winning.|`|1gHVlfbNaa	Wade is having a spectacular season no doubt but Kobe will still get that spot.  Kobe is the reigning MVP and until his game slumps significantly, he would still be considered the best in the league.|`|VJ1Gsr0Xaa	is wade a great player......yes. but he cannot take KB24s spot. nobody can.|`|YwpKrQOsaa	first of all if Wade is going to knock any Guard off the All-NBA first team it will be CP3    and no he doesn't deserve to be on the All-NBA first team as it stands currently|`|y8qGjcZyaa	He deserves it but Kobe deserves it more. Kobe is just an all-around player and his team is doing tremendously better than the Heat. If the Lakers get over 60 wins in the regular season than you know it's a given that Kobe's gonna make it through|`|Tr1iCV2Uaa	Yeah, he's having a better stat year    29ppg 5rpg 7apg 2spg 1.5bpg .492 pct shooting|`|1133b5d38a3d30a09c2b1c70499eaaf9aa	Kobey Bryant will make the All Star team.

Wg3UySpfaa	that's exactly how i feel, i'm glad there's others that can relate =)    Usually when the tennis is on, since i don't have University during this period i like to kick back all day enjoy the tennis, especially the night sessions, suddenly when tennis is over there is nothing to watch. I definitely look forward to each year. But i do also like when tennis reaches its final because that's the most exciting match.|`|ZLPVUQ1caa	my thoughts exactly....i guess its more easier after the french open cause the other slams follow pretty soon. But the gap between AO and RG is a little too long..|`|ctQLrbvIaa	not really. Normal tv will be bak!!|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	Yes, and I thought I was the only one!

I am sad that its ending but it made the start of my year great, watching the tennis everyday made me think to start playing tennis again, and how much i just want to go out and play sport. well i guess it has been a great start to the year with the aussie open, i guess we just have to wait for next year to see what the players bring to the game.    one more thing   GO NADAL!!!!!!!!!   :D

I also think Torres could easily replace Berba/Tevez and Riera would be ok the left, before park or giggs anyway. Reina would be a good addition also.    at below - carrick already plays for utd?|`|0t8XYZKRaa	It's great that the reds are in 3rd spot. I knew that the title race would go down to chelsea and man united (again). (scousers or liverpool fans I don't care if you give me thumbs down)|`|0b1a38ddb028d9a6c669ad7b4e4f3db8aa	I think there's 3 or 4 Liverpool players that could feature in a Man U starting line up. On paper it's a great team. The difference is the manager's ability to make proper use of them. Liverpool's problem is the manager...he has this 'play not to lose' mentality of the latins..rather than go out and play to win. Like last reason (liverpool lost less games than Man U)..far too many draws. Terrible manager..he needs to go. Great teams always have great managers...Liverpool haven't...Manchester United have. That's the difference. I think Liverpool could end up 4th or 5th.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Well if we don't win then we have Rafa to blame, don't we?  Who's says Steven Gerrard is the only good player on our team?  Which planet are you from?|`|DgS3MwYraa	Reina, Carrick, Alonso, Gerrard, Torres will all be challenging for places in Man team. I just can't figure it out though, Liverpool always fall out of the premiership race by Christmas or just after. Atleast they're getting closer to title, don't think they'll be in the running by March.    4th place for Liverpool this season...    Watch out for them in FA  Cup and Champions league...if Gerrard doesn't get injured!|`|ySQFCT9eaa	We will be lucky to make Europe with displays like last night,once again we fail to finish off a team and pay the price.I don,t think Gerrard would make a starting 11 he had a poor game for his standards especially the second half,a loss to Chelsea Sunday and we can forget it again|`|4ecd94d350b85a878a8087e8d7d214d4aa	No league for Liver  No 4th place for Aston Villa  No relegation for Tottenham  No titles for Arsenal     simply , the "as usual" effect !
hTruYNUQaa	None other than Allan Ruthven  He played 222 games  represented vic 17 times  Played in the clubs last premiership which was in 1944  Was captain coach for 3 years    Edit: with the extra info you have given it has to be Robert Walls    Edit: Chris Johnson is currently a development coach with Brisbane,but has never coached at senior level.    Edit: Matthew Primus currently assistant coach at port     Edit:John Blakey currently assistant coach at the swans.  Edit:They all fit your criteria except none of them have coached at senior level apart from Robert walls,Chris Johnson is a development coach .Your Q allows several canditates because it was not very clear.    Edit: The answer you are looking for is John Blakey who coached 1 game in 2005.|`|drUseNuFaa	Robert Shaw|`|2s244jGgaa	Ron Alexander.|`|WifhQyD4aa	Martin Pyke (hasn't he done assistant coaching at AFL Level?)|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	I think you mean VFL coach, because Fitzroys last premiership was in 1944, say the players at least 20 in 1944 premiership and was an AFL coach (1990+) he would have to be a minium of 66 years old when he starting coaching. I'm not having a go at the VFL/AFL thing, just was confused, when i couldn't find anyone.    If he was a coach in the VFL i'd take a punt at Allan Ruthven. He was coach of Fitzroy  between 19521954. Played more then 200 games and played in the 1944 Premiership.    edit: God that's hard! I have know idea.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I'll go with the other two guys and say Allan Ruthven. They seem to know.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Bernie Quinlan is one player I can think of.  Premiership was a night premiership i think.  I know he briefly coached, wasnt great though like so many brilliant players tend to make average coaches..dont know why.    Or Gary Pert is the other one that comes to mind.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Allan Ruthven I'll be the same as the rest
mMFJrPbvaa	"Mountain Areas" in march are going to be pretty cold.  There will still be skiing and snowboarding going on in most places.  So you are either going to have to give up the mountains part and go with the warm, or give up the warm part and go with the mountains.  Even the "Mtn Areas" in Northern Georgia and Tennessee will still be quite cold, never mind Colorado or Utah.      You can email me with any other questions
75ZMWlnnaa	haha wow so someone else apart from me has noticed it.    yeh, first time i watched american pie, when i saw stifler, i thought to myself 'doesnt that guy play tennis, whats he doing in a semi-porn film?'- i thought it was andy roddick, until i realised it was in fact seann william scott.    LOL...but yeh they look so similar.|`|abx5VNsOaa	They certainly do look similar,you have hawkeyes,lol.|`|Truakr2eaa	which ones andy roddick! lol|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Yes, they *do* look a lot alike...I don't know about SWS, but Andy himself has talked about it a a bunch of interviews over the years...|`|5efd635d2efc575613f62ccf23751c25aa	omg, I so agree with you, they do look very alike!!
thcr8Y5vaa	Mexico 1986...|`|L1QTSErIaa	At has to be Mexico 86. It was the era Maradona gave us a lesson on football. If there was one world cup won by one individual player, it was Mexico 86. From the first game he played, we all knew something special is going to happen.   He completely destroyed England. He gave us the best goal ever scored. And still how to play naughty with the 'hand of god'. He didn't score in the final, but everyone agrees he played the biggest part in all the goals. Truely a great legend was born in that tournament.   There will be no other world cup like that.|`|sfJp4QNJaa	None of them, we always do a 'drastic fail' on penalties at the end, when we should of won the match, or, our top player gets sent off, or, we have a winning goal disallowed on the 87 minute. None of them. Bunch of overpaid no0bs|`|gPsFFQbRaa	The last one on 2006. cause thats the first one i actally watched , i was 11 at that time, i wanted argentina to win, unfortunatly they didnt.  I really enjoyed it though.And thats when i understood football.|`|c0dyjQbYaa	Great Question !    For me it has to be Italia 90' - It was the 1st world cup I can remember watching and it has so many memories, not all good . England V Cameroon, Pavoroti, Gazza crying, Waddle peno miss.     The whole event was like nothing else I have seen.|`|8ORwpuTuaa	2002.     The final  held in Yokohoma in Japan when Brazil beat Germany 2-0.

YoVdcgovaa	Eat anything rich in potassium.  Potassium counter lactic Acid.  Also try going out slower during your race.  You should always be trying to negative splitting anyways.  Also your lactic acid might be due to nervousness.  Try some relaxation techniques before the race to calm you down.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	At swim meets, it is really important that you stretch, get enough warm up time, and cool down after every race (yes, even if it is your last race for the day.) If the pool that you are swimming in does not offer the option of a cool down pool, stretch in a WARM (not hot) shower. You should consult with your coach before doing this.|`|9nYifIn4aa	I know what you mean!  After my races, all of the lactic acid in my body goes straight to my stomach....I can barely move, it hurts so much.  My coach told me to find something to eat and drink that will help flush it out and always eat that.  Bagels and Powerade.  Also, make sure that you are warming down enough.  Do double of what you just swam, so after the 200 back, do a 400 warm down.|`|KsZQQkBfaa	Are you warming up and stretching before your races??    There's no way to stop it other than do more endurance training in practice.|`|9sVVoF14aa	Warm up with stretches and "cool down" with some more stretches
e30e77c78b50a342982567876887921baa	there was a girl on our team last year (she transferred schools but i saw her at a meet against our school). she was chunky too, but she didn't care, and stuck with doing her best in swimming. the weight just sorta fell off. or at least, it turned into muscle.    point is, don't be embarrassed. just get in there and swim hard, and soon you'll see a big difference. |`|9LVpjgoVaa	Dont worry about.    Not everyone is model like skinny, but swimming is a great way to stay in shape and take of pounds.|`|5PYJYmplaa	well swimming is a great sport.  it is one of the healthiest sports you can be involved in and is a life-lond sport (you can swim til the day u die).  plus swimming can help you fix those imperfections about your body and tone you.    trust me you'll enjoy it.  plus everyone else is in bathing suits so you are all in the same boat

f3b513a0133713ab68cfda8b8b712c06aa	there are somethings you could do. If you know what dry land workouts are those would be great. things such as abs, push ups (hands closer together and elbows in, best for swimming muscles). Another would be to get a stretch cord. You can put stretch cords almost anywhere, and just go through your normal swim strokes with it (make sure you stay controlled on your recovery, dont let the cord "fling" ur arms forward). Another would be like a total gym, again go through your motion of swim stokes or straight arm pull down. similar thing is a vasa trainer. dips are good. those are some of your best options i think. if you do some cardio workouts also that can never hurt.|`|2Pkgn88Paa	Run long distances to increase your endurance and stamina.|`|9nYifIn4aa	Run A LOT!

1nIdoB0paa	If I am on your part I'll start Rondo and Ford because Davis is having a hard time playing because he is newly recovered from injury and what you say he's rusty but give him 3-5 games he'll be back in the way he plays. Rondo had many assists per game and can shoot the ball well and Ford also can give assists and can shoot also the ball but not many as Rondo can.  For the trade I think you should accept it because Parker is much better than T-Mac in terms of points and assists per game. Also because Tony is much consistent than T-Mac and T-Mac is a injury risk player and I'm sure he will get injured many times during this NBA season.  My advice is that you should trade Ford for a much better PG like Derek Fisher, or Steve Blake and I'll advice you keep those other guys because they can help you in your campaign this season.  Good Luck for you!!!  Hope it helped!
wPlfPc0gaa	Considering the fact how often he was in the news for reasons, Symonds will quite relieved.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Actually it was Harbhajan who made the racist remarks, so why blame Symonds for that? This is his first charge under the code of conduct so that is the reason he received only a fine, and he wasn't even fined the maximum amount allowed.Why ask about Symonds? What of ALL the charges & misdemeanors involving Bhaji, did you question BCCI for not sacking him each time? Let us look after our players, it has nothing to do with the rest of the world. McCullum was gracious enough to overlook it & made the remark that he'd heard far worse on the cricket field.|`|AA11088802	at last .. symos got fine|`|2OO9U8o9aa	I thisnk thi9s guy has had far to many slaps on the wrist and it is time he was punished much more severely   He should be told to smarten5ern up his act , including getting that ridiculous hairstyle sorted !! , and be dropped from international cricket till he falls in line   He is a talented cricketer who has never really reached his potential because of all these off field activities and also thinking he is better than he is|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Its just a small slap on the wrist for an international sportsman.. They earn big bucks representing there country and through sponsorships. Australia jus let him off the hook because there middle order is in shambles..

And again|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	LOL!|`|mwGancPWaa	It serves him right Symonds should be sacked from all cricket( including backyard cricket :]) if he doesnt get his act together he is just cruel four incidents that is enough the australian cricket should sack him and fine him more like $10,000|`|gfgJUt62aa	dump 'm in neuro asylum for shock treatment, these kind of fines are petty for him after he turned up here for IPL even after harby and indian crowds were racist to him lmao at the weed|`|M2PVWLR8aa	He deserves it he needs to shut that mouth and I dont care that he was drunk he still needs to shut up|`|dSKjqYshaa	He should have been fined the Max.penalty.This is not the first time he has been involved in bringing the game of cricket into disrepute.It seems to me that he can dish out the proverbial stuff but cant take it when its thrown back at him.The Aust.match comittee must now take a strong stance and rip up his contract.Other wise he could and will be the down fall of the team.Now more than ever Aust.needs stability not interuptions.Bring in new guys and build for the future.|`|R5G9h2ygaa	In his statement he said that he understood that the fine was for all his comments during the interview, not just the lump of **** comment etc.    A lot of people are saying Symonds got off lightly but he merely said what he thought, a disobeying of orders such as 'gone fishing' is a far worse misdemeanour, he was not told not to drink, nor do the interview at the time.    In the end of the day all Symonds did was say a few stupid things after a few drinks and being fired up by Roy and HG and four grand is far from harsh

For the men, I do think the ranking is right, so Federer is the second best player. For the women, I think it's tough to say. I think Serena is the best because she has reached 3 consecutive grand slam finals, winning one and a possible second one in a day. For the second best in women's, I think it's between Safina and Dementieva. If Safina continues to play the way she did in the semi's last night, then she deserves the title of second best and the  2 ranking.|`|u2zEvkEkaa	Currently for men it's Roger Federer|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	Roger Federer who is playing Andy Roddick the  1 US player as we speak.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Roger Federer|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Right now it's Fed.

f05463dc082c3c7c8280c54e35eada93aa	You can check that your self at www.atptennis.com, there is each tennis player profile you can check their carrer earnings|`|U7BkuEU9aa	That can't be answered...it depends how far the players go in the tournaments they enter, what type of tournaments they enter...|`|giH1kGziaa	about half million american dollars in year minim|`|GombKA8Kaa	This is definitely determined by how well you go throughout the year.    Rankings have a lot to do with what you can earn because that determines what tournaments you are allowed to play in.    Therefore the higher the ranking the higher the prizemoney tournaments.    Every tournament is different depending how big the draw is. Most tournament are 32 Draws so you have to have a very good ranking to get into them.    There quite a few different tiers of tournaments from when you start out you are playing what they call the satellite circuit which are tournaments with total prizemoney of $10 000 to $25 000. Once your rankings go up you can get into larger tournaments that have varied prizmoney depending on the sponsors etc...    Of course the Grand Slams are the biggest and most important, they have a draw of 128 and that is why it goes for two weeks and it gives those person who are just starting up if they can get in get major points and prizemoney.

R0J1W3BCaa	Boxers get paid Millions of dollars if the become great fighters. A lot of MMA fighters have complained about not getting the money that the so desperately deserve. Tito Ortiz left the UFC because of it and Randy Couture spent a whole year not fighting over contract disputes. The UFC had promised him a certain amount of money and then once it was time to pay up they couldn't.     Personally I think MMA fighters should receive just as much money as boxing does. Then on the other hand MMA isn't as mainstream as boxing only until recently did it even have a serious market to even compete with Boxing. I bet it takes a lot of money to train as a MMA fighter considering the fact that they have to pay trainers in more than one discipline it sucks that they don't get paid much.
RFQTnf3yaa	I live in Victoria too, so it's nice to see a local question.  Unfortunately i don't know much about spear fishing.  I do a lot of fishing but with the conventional rod and reel.  I live in Gippsland and have seen a few spear fishers around Inverloch, Lower Tanjil and on the other side of the state around Warnambool. As obvious as it sounds, do it in clear water so around rainfall events is not worth it.      Check out this site which i have set up and spread the word.    www.crownseallures.com|`|lsY4kzo4aa	I also live in victoria. just search online some shops that sell equipment. there will be tonnes in the city.
Sh622OaEaa	You take the band between your thumb and index finger into the meaty part of your right hand. use your other hand to pull the spear back alongside your forearm putting tension on the band. Once its cocked use your right hand to hold it there. When your ready to shoot, just open up your right hand. thats about it.

uF31S9Dqaa	I assume your question refers to pro scouts looking at an amateur pitcher, presumably to be drafted.    In my experience, the best scouts look for pitchers that know how to get hitters out and are able to maintain their composure despite adversity. Baseball is as much, if not more so a mental game than it is a physical game - it's not always about being the biggest or fastest, but often the smartest.    As far as getting guys out, I think most scouts like to see guys who induce a lot of ground balls, followed by strikeouts and then fly ball pitchers. There are always questions about durability and how a player's body will develop over time. Will he be able to withstand the stress of a professional season, living away from home, traveling, pitching in front of larger crowds, and so on - those are all questions that have to be answered.    Likewise, is he sign-able? Does he want to play pro ball right away or does he want to go to college?    Do his mechanics look sound? Does he look like he's risking injury with his delivery?     A lot of things go into the evaluation process - these are a few of the bigger topics that tend to come up.     Remember that scouting and drafting is a mix between evaluating a player's work in the past and projecting his ability into the future. A lot of it is making an educated guess, and the younger the player is, the harder it is to nail down an accurate projection.    Hope that helps -|`|e3aZsDqwaa	velocity pitch selection composure stamina   all that kind of stuff good luck|`|XWvD81COaa	Beer!|`|CKP98samaa	They will look at mechanics above everything else.  If you're mechanics aren't up to snuff...they won't bother to look, unless they feel you have something they can work with.  For example, a 98 MPH fastball or a brutal curveball.

L4z1FI5Kaa	We usually cook Sweet Potatoes inthe same way as regular Jacket potatoes - just scrub and bake.  For a meal Jacket "Peruvian Sweet Potatoes"  Jacket potato baked in its skin.  Scoop out the soft potato into a bowl, stir in 1 ounce (25gr) cream cheese. half an egg yolk (I usually do two at once!) 1/2 tspchilli powder, 1 large chopped spring onion, add sea salt & black pepper to taste.  Mix the lot together, pile back into the skin.  Dot a little butter or extra grated cheese on top. Sprinkle with a little extra chilli powder and grill.     To make rice more acceptable, have you come across the Thai style sweet chilli dip?  That stirred into it gives a whole new flavour.  Or just chop in things like onion, sweet corn, chopped mushrooms, etc.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Sweet Potatoe pie, or just mashed with butter.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	I really like whole wheat spaghetti with tomato sauce with green, red, and yellow peppers, mushrooms, and onions. I make a lot of baked potatoes and grilled chicken breasts when the weather permits. I wrap the potatoes in foil with just a spay of cooking oil like pam.  I don't put anything on them, they taste great by them self.  You can bake a sweet potato the same way. I always use the huge potato's like you find in restaurants.

That works out to a start every couple of months.    In fact, a typical Thoroughbred can make more starts than that.  The Jockey Club statistics include two-year-olds, and two-year-olds, if they race at all, typically make fewer starts than most more mature horses.  An older horse in racing fitness can usually make a start every 2-4 weeks, depending on the horse.      Most horses take breaks throughout the year to freshen or to allow minor injuries or illness time to heal.  If you can believe it, there used to be a time when racing pretty much went into hiatus in the winter and horses got a real break.  A lot of trainers would winter their horses in Aiken, South Carolina or other spots, taking them off the track around October or November and not cranking them up again until February or March.  But with year-around racing now there are fewer trainers who give their horses a break.|`|URO3gDXcaa	what is an average horse?

afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	I'm not sure where everyone else is from, but where I live there is most certainly an upswing in the demand for older new in box condition S&W revolvers (and 95%-98% guns), regardless of the model. Before I submit this answer, feel free to thumbsdown it all you'd like. I just know how things are here (Ohio) the past year or so at local gun shows and shops.    With that being said, below is Blue Book pricing and a few running and closed auctions that closed WELL over book prices!.  MODEL 28 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN   - .357 Mag. cal., "Highway Patrol" utility model, dull blue or brushed nickel (very rare) finish, adj. sights, standard grips, blue only, 4 or 6 in. barrel. Mfg. 1954-1986.   Grading ..............100% ......98%    1957-1986 mfg. ...$450 ......$400    Add $20 for Target Sights.  There were 3 engineering changes to this model.   Sold for $565  http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...  Sold for $585  http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...  Sold for $406.99  http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...

Sold for $483  http://www.auctionarms.com/search/displa...  Sold for $395  http://www.auctionarms.com/search/displa...   There appears to be quite a demand for them.|`|fjT0GoSqaa	You have to find the right buyer for a revolver like that.    I would not be interested in one as a buyer.  I like the smaller K frame i.e. the Model 19.    N frame too huge and cartoonish and impractical for concealed carry|`|qoE9H2WNaa	Even in NIB unfired condition, This M-28 'service grade' revolver has no real collectors' value, and, even if you still have the original box & documentation, I doubt it is worth more than $250 or so, as there is little demand for this over-size 'hand-cannon. The M-27, with its' superior fit & finish is a different story, but only if one can find the right buyer.|`|QNX9NET3aa	In the condition you describe I would say around $350. It is a good gun but has little collector interest at this time.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	I have never seen a NIB Highway Patrolman go for $250  The least I see is around$400    The only old Smith you are getting for $250 is a used Model 10 or  J Frame|`|FNMMm7Dnaa	ABOUT 350-425 DOLLARS|`|qqb4xdpQaa	.357's are still popular for home protection, as such the value remains constant, however since it is a second hand gun I'd say around $400 US.  Of course for a collection item it would increase substantially.

RX5t6x6Haa	did you ever take notice that they make co2 tanks and HPA tanks? they make two different tanks for a reason, a co2 tank is make to hold liquid, and a LITTLE bit of pressure, like maybe 80psi  HPA is directly made for compressed air, all the way up to 5000psi, the hand pump would probably would work, but it would take forever, just go to your local paintball store and fill up and the fill station, it'll take under 20seconds    EDIT: NERDCORE, you somehow can hand pump an HPA tank up, because i pump up my 3000psi PCP air rife with a hand pump just takes forever to compleatly fill|`|JXMVNEQoaa	ill keep it short and just tell you right off the bat it would explode|`|RuJYupFWaa	You can't pump air into an hpa tank with any hand pump unless you were Superman or Hercules or whatever.  Most people have used a hand pump to fill a bicycle tire at one point, and those only go to, what, 40-120 psi, average bike is 60 psi?  Automobile tires are 30 psi average.  An hpa tank is 3,000-5,000 psi.  THOUSANDS of pounds per square inch.    Don't pump compressed air into a co2 tank.  I'm unsure of the safety issues involved but it's not practical.  Co2 burst disks give out between 2200-2800 psi.  So any amount of compressed air it could theoretically hold wouldn't last very long.      Also, co2 tanks don't have regulators on them.  Part of the cost of hpa tanks is the regulator on it.  It regulates that 3,000-5,000 psi the tank may contain down to a preset of 850 (for HP tanks) or 450 (for LP tanks)... or 650 in the case of Guerrilla's tank regs.  And those regulators are one of the main reasons hpa is better, because it results in more consistent & efficient air usage.|`|75XlcTiAaa	Due to carbon dioxide's properties (don't ask me what they are) it is more "expansive" than plain air and thus one can fill a metal tank with less of it for the same result as filling it with more air. This is why people need to refill HPA tanks more often than CO2 tanks ( see link: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;... ), as a result of a faster loss of pressure.     Although I can't speak with experience, it would seem to me that, since HPA tanks can not be refilled by means of a standard air compressor or a "hand pump"due to the pressure difference therein (we're talking thousands of psi here), and I would conclude that CO2 tanks are more practical and therefore I have two.     In actual answer to your question; I would strongly advise against attempting to fill a CO2 tank (or any tank for that matter) with compressed air unless you are, as it says on the tanks themselves "a trained personnel." It also says to fill them in accordance with "CGA Pamphlets P-1, C-6, G-6.3 and AV-7 available from the Compressed Gas Association, 4221 Walney Rd., Chantily, Virginia 20151-2926."    Hope that helps!

OTjWvphWaa	Your speech does one thing well, you establish your ethos, why you have the character qualifications necessary to be a captain. However, you miss answering the most important question, what beyond your qualities as someone in lots of clubs would make you a good leader?    Talk about your responsible nature, your spirit, how you like to help out a team. Anything that makes you seem like a more mature leader would help. Also, talk about how your experience with this specific team has led you to understand how it works and why you would be the best for it.    Hopefully that helped.

Nothing ever gets hit to right field (well, almost never), and catchers aren't generally fast.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	You should play 2nd base, you don't need that strong of an arm and it's pretty easy to learn.|`|V03f8tmMaa	I think you should be a ball boy|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	If its slow pitch,  catcher.   Fast pitch,  you sound like a 1st baseman.|`|e3aZsDqwaa	first base     good luck  practice hitting though|`|T5UBrKZjaa	Lefty...you should try 1B or RF.    As far as getting better, Coach Mike Candrea ( University of Arizona as well as USA Olympic Coach) has produced FREE online softball videos at www.sportskool.com.    You will get alot of advice however, Coach Candrea is THE authority on fastpich softball in the USA and has the record to back it up.     Good Luck|`|LlEr2OdBaa	Your best bet sounds like 1st base. its great to have a lefty on first. you are going to have to bulk up a bit becasue any position is going to require running, catching and throwing.    good luck.|`|IrnHxv0iaa	I played baseball for at least 7 years, and your best bet would be 1st base or even short stop. And a way you can build your arm up is by practicing throwing a ball into a tire swing, and for your spped play football with friends and that will get you scared and then you will be able to run faster.lol that is what I did|`|AA11808177	If your not scared of the ball play first base for sure.  Just as long as you play with passion people will respect you for doing so!!  Play the field start and try left field you dont need the best arm there and if you can make good cuts on the ball you will do well.  Just pratice with coach and friend and enjoy the best game on earth.|`|s7c20QmGaa	i would say catcher or more likely 1st base for any position you will need to build up ur arm strength though|`|s4VzPulYaa	Oh I know I can help with this one!!!!!!  I play fastpitch softball, and I am left handed also!  I play centerfield, because I'm fast.  If you are tall, or at least normal height, tryout for 1st base.  You should also try playing 2nd base, Texas A&M has a fantastic 2nd baseman that is also left handed.... Her name is Natalie Villarreal, and she is amazing!   Some people say that having lefties play infield, is tough because they have to turn around to throw the ball, just do a reverse pivot, and you should be fine!
KTp27Fokaa	AFC- I have Patriots as well. They were very strong this year without Brady, and this year they actually have a 1st round pick.    NFC- Agree as well, Eagles. The defense is very strong and this team is close to unstoppable when they have both McNabb and Westbrook healthy (which is rare, but who knows?)    AFC North- Benagls@10-6   Sure, laugh now. But this team played very well down the stretch. Their defense allowed 6 points in the final 3 games, and Cedric Benson looked good at RB. With Carson Palmer at QB, things are on the upside.    AFC West- Broncos@12-4     Had to expect this one. They will all their much needed holes on defense and stay prominent on offense.    AFC East- Patriots@14-2    This team is still great. With Cassel, Randy Moss wasn't much of a factor, but Brady can actually throw the deep ball, and Moss will become a force to be reconed with once again.    AFC South- Texans@11-5   This team is very good when Schaub is healthy. They should fix the defense enough. Slaton is a very good RB. I like the way this team is looking.    WC1- Colts@10-6    This team just does not miss the playoffs. Peyton Manning is a winner (until the playoffs roll around)    WC2- Raiders/Chargers@10-6    This one will go to an AFC   West team. As much as I hate to say it, it will. The Chargers outscored the opposition by a good amount this year. And I think this is the Raiders' year. They will fix the O-line and get a good WR. Cable is the best coach they have had in awhile.      NFC North- Packers@ 9-7  They have troubles on defense, but the offense is pretty good under Rodgers. I think Grant will go back to 2007 form.    NFC West- Niners@ 10-6   This was a different team under Singletary. When they were losing, they were being killed under him. This coach knows how to inspired his team. And if this team gets Sanchez, that's a bonus.    NFC East- Eagles@ 13-3  I already explained this.    NFC South- Saints@ 11-5  Drew Brees is a great QB and is even better when he has Bush healthy, because he is a great receiving RB. Pierre Thomas is a decent running back. This defense has been bad for years now, and I think this is the year it improves finally.    WC1- Giants@ 10-6  This defense is still very good and they have Brandon "the truck" Jacobs. This team knows how to win.     WC2- Cowboys@ 10-6  Lose the tiebreaker to the Giants. This team has a lot of talent, and even with all the dysfunction this year, and the tough schedule, they still were able to manage a 9-7 season. I think the improve 1 game and get in.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I'd say whoever wins the Super Bowl should be the favorite in their conference. Right now I'd say Steelers and Giants, but I may have to reconsider that depending on what happens in the Super Bowl and later in free agency and the draft.|`|oqeoUKj2aa	no Colts...wow....Manning won 9  games in a row by himself practicly this year. with everyone healthy and a Rookie DL watch out....they will win superbowl|`|2CuuIT70aa	I do like the Chargers, so long as both LT and Sproles come back.  If not, then I'm looking at the Ravens, provided Ray Lewis comes back.  IF EVEN THAT doesn't happen, then its back to the Patriots, no matter what happens to them.    In the NFC I'm thinking that the top team will definitely come from the NFC East, I'll pick the Eagles just because I'm the smallest amount of a homer and because I think that if our tackles (Runyan and Thomas) come back we have the fewest holes out of any other NFC team.  If they leave then I'm looking at the Redskins, the only team to beat the Eagles twice this year.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	looks pretty good but I'll put some of my thoughts.  North-good, East-perfect  THOUGHT:West-You really never know who will win that division.sure the Chargers have Merriman back, so they cant really get any worse, but it's just that whole division that is a mess.I'm not saying the Raiders will win it, just saying that you never know.if i had to choose one for the west, then yes it would be the Chargers.  THOUGHT:South-i heard Jones-Drew talking about the team, and he said he has never been on a team so mixed up in his life.i would not count on them getting very far.  Ravens will blow out the competition.  THOUGHT:I think the match-up will be between the Colts and Texans, actually.people are always saying that the Titans had the easiest schedule, but it is pretty true i think.their REALLY good, i know but i think the Colts will go back to their prime days, and the Texans will have an amazing break-out year.  then for the NFC i would say the Packers still being a mess, just because their QB isn't the only problem, and i really don't know about the Cowboys.but i hope they do good.|`|VzFHWCVdaa	Patriots & Cowboys r best.  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|44plW4Lfaa	steelers will be freakin the best next year, and afc, im going to go with shocking 49ers|`|AUjTaLvwaa	i agree with your AFC predictions except replace the ravens with the colts. although, i disagree with all of your nfc predictions. i doubt packers will win the north, switch eagles and cowboys. atlanta will win the south. replace cardinals with 49ers. giants will have a losing record next year, replace them with the saints.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Steelers in the AFC    Eagles in the NFC  --------    dudeboy...49ers are in the NFC...so it would be a HUGE shocker for them to be best in the AFC|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Nice picks, I won't go into detail but...    NFC: Packers    AFC: Jaguars|`|6149747106ff1de5673d8b19c36bf46baa	i got my bolts, u hit the nail on the head, with Merriman back & all the guy we are gonna via the draft & FA we should be the hottest contender in the AFC    for the NFC it always changes in 06, its the Saints & Bears, in 07 its the Packers & Cowboys, in 08 it was the Giants & Panthers, it changes every season, but the team i saw a lot of progress is the Atlanta Falcons, yeah they lost in the 1st round, but all that experience they gain in that loss to AZ, Matt Ryan should have a great 2nd season|`|1gPJO37qaa	I agree with you except the packers wont win the worth.|`|0ZqJbmVyaa	I am an Eagles fan and I have very little hope the Eagles will even make the playoffs, I think management is destined to make every wrong decision.  Without McNabb the Eagles are NFC East cellar dwellers and I think they may deal him, stupid.  But my selections for next year are the Pats vs Carolina but there are several teams that have a chance to get there.    I am a little surprised you weren't a homer and pick San Diego, but I think 8-8 will win the AFC West.  The schedules are brutal.|`|WNv8PDlzaa	chargers aren't going to make the playoffs.

Chuck Liddell and Matt Hughes for instance. But for GSP and BJ Penn I haven't seen it. If anything I would think he would want GSP to win. Because GSP has said that if he wins he'll step up to fight Anderson Silva. Which would mean $$$$ for the UFC.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	Yes, I do see some favoritism in Dana White's MMA toy box.  However, I have not really seen that much of it in the Penn-St. Pierre fight.  On UFC Primetime, it does seem like White is pulling for Penn, but I don't think he's making a difference in the fight.    The biggest, most blatant of White's favoritism is Chuck Liddell vs. Tito Ortiz at UFC 66.  Liddell and White are very close friends, and White and Ortiz are bitter enemies.  Nevertheless, White's one-sided commentary usually has no effect on the fight.|`|6giiUbr0aa	he shows favoritism to those who make him money|`|CpYJlFrPaa	The only reason he has favourites is because he is a business man. Yes of course he becomes friends with certain fighters but he also wants fighters to be marketable for the organization. Picture it this way, your ufc president and someone unmarketable (we'll say Mac Danzig) is a really nice guy, thats great but clearly unmarketable. Someone who is more well known and marketable (for instance, Kenny Florian), your clearly going to become more favourable of kenny because he will be the guy to put butts in those seats. I think you have to get to a certain level of skill and martketability for Dana White to become really close to you.     To answer your question well look at these possibilities!  - BJ wins ... 1st time in history someone will hold 2 belts at different weight classes at the same time.  - BJ wins ... sets up a 3rd fight between him and george if george worked his way back up to the top (which most likely would happen because Dana would show favouritism to him)    - GSP wins ... Very good for his career the fans will love him and there will be a little more martketability for him.     Ultimately BJ winning would be the best case scenario for someone like Dana!|`|r5AMG8g7aa	It does not matter what you or I think about it. When the fighters get in the ring it has no effect on the outcome. Why even bother with this question?|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	yep|`|LN2oLOg8aa	Dana White doesn't have favorites. he is friends with them. He's showing every one that even though he's the boss, he is still someone they can talk to and laugh around and hang out with,
l6g3moiEaa	You could, but an alarm goes off at Corporate every time someone fiddles with the patch.    Also, yeah, I'm kinda looking forward to Jeff Hardy wiping that smirk off his brother's face at NWO, and the off chance that Christian might actually show up (he can't wrestle for 90 days, but he can get on the mic, yeah?). But I'm already thinking that the Raw Chamber match is gonna blow. Kingston and Mysterio add some needed flavor to the title hunt, but seriously, I can't see either of them actually taking it home.|`|jplKBkhhaa	Take scissors and cut it off.

lzbxT6p9aa	There is WAAAYYYY too many matchups to mention but here are my 3 matches I'd like to see before I die.     The Rock -V- Sting. 2 Icon's of the wrestling business, never faced each other and both have always said they would like to.     The Road Warriors -V- Team 3D. Arguably the 2 greatest tag teams of all time, this would be a spectacle to watch.     The Motorcity Machineguns -V- The Hardy Boyz (ladder match) All true wrestling fans know what these 2 teams are capable of and put together in the same ring at the same time, this has potential to be one of the most legendary matches of all time.     BQ: Of course they should bring back the cruiserweight title.|`|55LcBlIraa	my all time dream match have always been The Rock (face rock) vs Bret Hart (heel bret, which imo was the better and more vicious bret)    others would be definitely orton (now heel) vs hart (heel). i know, heel vs heel but see hart above.    both matches would be singles matches, no stipulations, just two guys, one ring, one winner, one ref, one bell, one lillian garcia.      no to the cruiserweight title......it's taking away from randy orton and the legacy's camera time.....|`|dSy1Kkdiaa	Stone Cold VS Jehrico   Hardcore Holly vs Cena  Undertaker VS the hardys      And yes they should bring back da cruiserweight championship    plz give me best answer i need it|`|BAurzDXtaa	Kurt Angle vs Brian Danielson two of the greatest if not the best two wrestlers on the planet today. They would put on a mat classic. Kurt with his amateur wrestling background and Danielson with his methodical approach and innovative submission holds. Any true wrestling fan would love to see this match happen.    BQ: Yes they have many talented cruiser-weight wrestlers in the WWE that are being used as jobbers or not being used at all. The cruiser weight title would create something for them to do and it would probably increase the ratings quite a bit.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	kurt angle vs chris jericho in an ultimate submission match      no|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Austin v Goldberg  Rock v Ricky Steamboat  New Age Outlaws v The Killer Bees    Yes they should bring back the Cruiserweight Championship.|`|2KBN2lCUaa	No. 1: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Hulk Hogan    No. 2: The Undertaker vs Sting    BQ - Yes they should and also get more cruiser weight wrestlers|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Fatal-4-Way, with all of these wrestlers at their prime;  Killer Kowalski vs Andre the Giant vs Hulk Hogan vs The Undertaker  Greatest in the 50s and 60s vs Greatest in the 70s vs Greatest in the 80s vs Greatest in the 90s.

Mi3rHjcYaa	Very simple, because Harrell ran the Spread Offense at Texas Tech. In the NFL teams dont run the Spread Offense, on the other hand Mark Sanchez at USC ran a Pro-Style Offense which is identical to the NFL offense.    Harrell's success came from running a Spread Offense. Did you see him play at the Senior Bowl? He was horrible because they forced him to run a Pro-Style offense.    Harrell wont be a good NFL QB.      edit: Ironpump summed it up pretty well. Graham Harrell never takes snaps under center and always just dumping off small easy passes.    edit: Nah you're not Ignorant. You just didnt know.|`|1gPJO37qaa	Hes good|`|khTuZrVsaa	he is a system QB.  All he did in college is sit back in the shot gun and pick out one of 5 WR running routs.  In the NFL he;s going to have to drop back and make reads.  Reads are much easier to make in the shot gun as well.|`|RS3fjNboaa	QB's under Mike Leach typically do not make good NFL players. The best example I can give you is Tim Couch. He's a Mike Leach product.|`|IrnHxv0iaa	I will tell you why,because he is good but he aint no Sam Bradford baby. hahaha|`|2iljcSGqaa	I don't have idea about it  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Did you watch the Senior bowl. He highlighted his weaknesses. He is accurate cause Tech threw 5 yard dump passes and his players did the rest. He was in shotgun the whole time and no one knows if he can take snaps under center. He is accurate in his stats but if the WR runs about 11 yards out for a curl he can't even put the ball in the numbers more like into the ground which is why he is so low. He has no presence in the pocket to step up and deliver a strike. I think he is a 5th round prospect at best, he looked worse then any QB at the Senior bowl including John Parker Wilson. Pretty weak arm too. He also throws the out route pretty bad. So many balls went to the WRs feet. Probably 90% of his throws beyond 10 yards are bad. You know when Peyton Manning and almost any other QBs hit their WRs in the numbers on a 10 yard curl? Harrell can't even do that. He throws really bad out of the pocket when under center. Also he waits for the player to get there where as in the NFL you throw it to a spot where your WR should be.

1uSoU8Lpaa	I'll give you Brett Favre. But he's more likely to do a fishing/hunting show and reminisce about football. So to integrate the two, on game day I can almost see Berman saying, "And now Brett Favre in the Marshes of Mississippi, what's your take?" Cut to brett Favre wading through reeds with a fishing pole.   Thanksgiving Day Favre's sitting in a tree in camo giving his picks for the day.   Another game day, Favre cleaning fish while he tells people why he loved the Packers.    I don't think it would get too far, but it's probably one of the only ways to get Brett to do any announcing.

A good time to catch them is the week before Memorial Day in Charlotte, NC.  A lot of teams have special days for fans.  Sometimes drivers do special appearances and autograph signings for members of their fan club.  Here is one place you can find out where they will be, but the schedule isn't ready for this year.  http://jayski.com/pages/appear.htm  Also, if you have a lot of money, you could pay to meet him.  Sometimes different tracks will auction off a spot to ride with drivers in the back of a pick-up truck before the race.  I've seen people pay $2500

qHkJZHwzaa	I think the grease is called cosmolane or something like that.    Do you live somewhere hot?  Strip the gun down removing everything from the wood.    Put the gun on a sheet of plastic and leave it in the sun till the grease softens (an hour or so), then wipe it down with turpentine.  You may need to do this ten or twenty times.  Each time, let it dry and heat up again.    When you are getting close to getting most of it gone, try a spray on oven cleaner and some very fine steel wool.    I dont know what wood it is, but they were a mass produced communist block military weapon so I dont think it would be anything too good.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Birch and beech were the most common woods used.    And by "true" do you mean thats its not a Ukrainian refurb?    Any way, that grease is called cosmoline and some furniture polish will take it off the stock. But you should soak the metal in diesel to remove the cosmoline.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	The stocks were usually Birch.  But a few were made out of arctic birch, which is a very pretty wood with contrasting colors and lots of figure.  That was normally used by the Finns when they refurbished 91/30s.  The Russians also tried a laminate stock for a while.      Check out some of the other poster's links for how to clean them.  Don't use oven cleaner.  It belongs in the oven, not on gun stocks.  It can cause long term damage to the wood.  I found that out the hard way after I used it on one of mine, following a so-called expert's advise.    And the other poster is right, they shoot better with the bayonet out.  The sights are calibrated to shoot that way, and not having it out throws your aim off.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinSpec.ht...

tIBZ9Gi3aa	Lol,frankly I hope that United can take the chance to go 5 points clear,or rather 4 points clear,if Liverpool and Chelsea draw.    Everton beating United is very likely.Everton's been on a roll and hasn't been beaten since December 7th.United's not exactly in 5th gear,we've been churning out 1-0 results one too many times for my liking.I just hope that the 5-0 win over West Brom would finally open the floodgates for us and return to our free scoring ways.I don't think that'll be the case,since Everton has a stingy defence and are very good at set plays.They can hold us to a draw or maybe even shock us.    Liverpool and Chelsea has draw written all over it,but I have a gut feeling someone might just poke a leg out and stab the ball in for a narrow win for either team.    Arsenal looks good at the moment,but so has West Ham.Arsenal on paper are stronger,but I have a feeling they might draw.Same case with Villa and Wigan,although I think either Villa would win of Wigan would win.|`|bNykcEVXaa	Deano...

Not everyone is built to be a sprinter, however anyone, with the right training can be a middle distance or long distance runner. If you are set on increasing your speed, power and explosive weights as well as short steep hill runs.
pMzq6B3paa	I don't recomend that. Your pad might desenagrate, and there's gonna be bits of your pad floating all over the pool.|`|9LVpjgoVaa	No Never !  buy a tampon in the bathroom at the pool if you don't have one.|`|bhyVC2mtaa	yes you can, but it will absorb as much water as it can.  if the liquid in the pad turns into a gel, do NOT use it. if you stit down, it will burst into a jelly gross mixture everywhere. trust me.  i like always ultra thin (yellow one) without wings.  but, tampons are waay easier but i was not comfortable using them at frist either.  the diva cup is also good but uncomfortable at first.  so just use the pad, and get a friend to keep on guard and tell you if they see gel or blood comming from your butt down your leg.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	You can, but I would not suggest it because the pad absorbes the water and it becomes very big and heavy and people will probably be able to see it through your swim suit. If you can find a really tough, really thin one, I'm sure it would be fine.|`|2xpzhN5faa	I wouldn't advise it|`|16rikzbLaa	You can, but do you want to take the chance with seeing your blood in the water? Water does not STOP your flow.    I know you said you wouldn't but its better if you get to know yourself first before using a tampon. Get a mirror and all the junk. Plus, once its IN correctly, you shouldn't feel it at all.    Basically you are taking a risk with a pad. I'm just going swimming this weekend and I figured out how to use one today.    Either go swimming or go home.    Good luck!!!|`|b7fRwEmjaa	i wear a pad in the pool  a thin one though  so it doesnt go thick and squishy haha.    dont worry its fine.|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	No! It might float away! Try and use a tampon, or just wait until you're off.|`|SKT2R5f7aa	No, once you go in, the pad will absorb all the water and when u get out, blood will leak...gross.|`|5rXQpDAJaa	Absolutely not! Do not wear a pad in the pool! That is kind of disgusting|`|9nYifIn4aa	NO NO NO NO NO!  that is really really gross!  it will get all soggy and not absorb any blood|`|CSPKKFunaa	NO  u can't do that, that's so discussing|`|Ve9RIz7Caa	don't wear a pad in the pool. it will absorb water and become huge and filled with water. i know from experience. try a tampon, they really aren't that bad and they work great! if you feel really uncomfortable and its at the end of your period you can wear a small panty liner, but nothing more. hope i helped! =)|`|D1lJorh8aa	i do... an ultra thin pad of coarse!

75ZMWlnnaa	when he first came on the scene, i disliked him because he acted like such a showoff about how he was going to beat federer in the 4th round at AO 2007, and haha roger wiped novak off the court.    then, he did the impersonations, i found them pretty funny, i did not hate him as much.     but then come AO 2008, he beat federer in SF, and then he acted like he was the best in the world, with some very arrogant comments, and then when he beat tsonga in the final, he kept saying "i am very very proud of myself"- sorry i know he was happy to have won his first grand slam, but surely he could have been a bit more humble.    he got his butt kicked at wimbledon in the 2nd round by safin, and that surely knocked his big ego down a few notches, he was saying "i think federer is a little worried now"- he got taught a big lesson that he should be focusing on his own game rather than how federer or nadal are playing. i was real happy to see eliminated because i thought he was acting like a real spoilt attention-seeking brat.    but then...suddenly i guess my hatred for him suddenly turned mutual because i realised that he is a very good player, and i do like his game, it certainly is quite interesting. also, i guess it is good for tennis to have a guy who does create quite a bit of controversy, it is good for the sport to have someone with a unique character, although i am sure alot of tennis fans have been too used to the class acts and professionalism of federer and nadal.    i think djokovic has a very long way to go before he can even be considered on the same level as federer or nadal. i read that he has had some breathing problems, as well as other physical problems, and that is something that he is going to have to address if he is to get better. he is not as mentally solid as nadal and federer, but he is still very young, and the advantage for him is that he has time on his side.    i am a mutual fan of novak, i believe that deep down, he is an alright guy at heart, it is just that he gives people a bad impression of himself, and his high self-confidence in himself can often be mis-represented by pure arrogance.|`|AA12082000	I like him,but he should keep his family out of his game cause they are giving him the bad publicity.|`|LissCUFQaa	He plays good tennis...I like him.    EDIT: yes,he lacks heart...|`|ctQLrbvIaa	He has a long face. No offence|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I think he's a spoiled, self-important brat who's disrespectful of his fellow players and a total choker. When he sees that things aren't looking good for him, he suddenly invents 300 illnesses to get out of a game, thinking that being the boy who cried wolf is less humiliating than losing 3-1 to a very in-form Roddick, for example...    I get that the crowd likes him because he puts on a show for them with the impressions and his general funny business, but there's a reason why he's so unpopular among other players...think about it. And nobody can say that it's out of envy because if that was the case nobody would be more hated than Rafa and Fed and they are pretty much the best-liked players "in the locker-room', as they say.|`|BVaVNrdOaa	he comes across as some kind of bond villain. As though somehow, he causes all the fan trouble. I dont much like him.|`|mh9Xcsd3aa	Actually, unlike most of the people who answered, I like Djoko. He's good and he's still young so he could still get better- way better. He's also gorgeous. It's interesting to watch him.
oPbLcfKoaa	The picture you posted is of a NEW bike, not an old one. If you want something like that just look for cruisers. I think the one in the picture is an Electra.

AA10939368	I thought that Notre Dame had the most national championships with 13, and Yale had the most with 18 since college football began.  I must be mistaken on that.  Oklahoma was not even the best this season, they lost to Florida.      Anyone who follows college football and has been a fan for a long time would disagree with that statement.  I would be one of them.|`|uoEfoI7aaa	ONLY BECAUSE 90% OF THEIR TEAM COMES FROM TEXAS!!!|`|7cjn2u9uaa	Finally they confirm what we have always known, OU is the best.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I knew you were Luke H you kept sending me messages under that account too. So what where were you when Oklahoma lost. It took you 2 weeks to show yourself again. Some fan, if you can dish it out then you deserve to take it. You got so cocky a lot of people posted questions just for you and you were nowhere to be found. Personally I'm betting you were that DeMarco Murray guy and went back to Felicia C since you both started sending me similar emails.|`|J3kfQtViaa	And then you woke up, with a terrible ringing sound in your cranium. It was a hangover, a hangover massive enough to explain why you would call oklahoma the best.     By the way that is funny that you are singing espn's praises now, but on your luke h. account you were saying that they were and i quote "biased against oklahoma."    ok now that i see that tea-sip thing  i do agree that it is kinda funny    Not surprised at all seeing this kind of garbage coming out of ESPN.  They really are losing credibility and ppl are starting to not like them.  This also explains why the BCS is so biased because they all have votes.    I definately like the way you patronize texas a&m though.  I was doing the same thing earlier in the season when it benefited me lol.  I was practically a longhorn fan LOL.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	All year long?    Did that link say that OU was the best team this season?...Nope...

No matter what his intentions were he injured Wallace|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	So not everyone has intentions of doing something but you still have to pay the price for doing it. Jeeze you are basically saying someone could kill someone else by hitting them with their car and they say they didnt do it intentionally but they still dont have to serve any time and the driver gets away with murder? aye man people are scrwed up these days|`|EcgzRGPwaa	Bynum wasn't even going for the ball, it was a lame foul on his part.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Bynum hasn't been suspended...  yet.    I'll grant you he probably wasn't thinking "Okay, time to put this clown out for a few weeks."   The question is, just what the heck was he thinking?  If you deliver a hip check like that to a guy who's up in the air and stretching for the basket, the guy is gonna go down hard.   Bad luck for Wallace AND Bynum that he was injured that badly, but that's the chance you take when you deliver a cheap shot.  If Bynum had followed the rules and played the ball, nothing would have happened to him if Wallace was injured.      Look at it this way..  if you speed through a red light and hit another car, you're gonna get hit with a lot bigger charge then if you just ran the light.  You were trying to hit anybody in either case, but more damages means bigger consequences.|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	how long is he suspended???    and half the fault was geralds    he drives to the basket with no regard with what happens to himself    maybe this is a reality check for him that he just cant throw his body at the rim|`|OxS3UVE6aa	well he didn't mean but he still did break some bones. tell me how would you feel right now if you were wallace?|`|CaJMkTXSaa	FACE IT MATE THATZ LIFE|`|piWK49fAaa	bynum shouldn't be suspended. he obviously wasn't trying to hurt wallace.

QMveJrziaa	I agree 100%. The diva division on WWE is a joke. I hope Jillian gets the title first. She is long overdue for a good push. When is the last time she even won a singles match in WWE?? Plus, she is a talented wrestler, sucks that WWE hold her down as much as they do. Katie Lea and Natalia should definetly get pushes to, but I would like to see Jillian get hers first.|`|H3nbC71eaa	I know Katie Lea is awesome in the ring, I've seen her wrestle in Shimmer. Haven't seen Jillian wrestle outside of WWE though. Natalya can wrestle very well though. I believe it all comes down to the character of the wrestler in WWE, I believe they don't think Katie Lea or Jillian have anything special in that regard...but I think Natalya can be WWE Woman's champion. Out of the 3 I think she can do it first.|`|DfPyyDssaa	Natalya Neidhart.|`|6LQNK51uaa	Womens championship    My guess is Katie Lea b/c she full fills the WWE requirement to be a champ.

How did Candice become a woman's champ at all?  It has to do with both the storyline and the eye candy. (Sad to say!)  I think the only women that can really wrestle in WWE are Natalya, Beth, Mickie and Katie Lee. The others are just learning or just there to be seen.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Natalya Neidhart,  Since Victoria left WWE, she is the most talented diva.

Gi4J3KKEaa	use your jab frequently, upstairs and downstairs to throw him off his combo rhythm. the best way to defeat a combination puncher is to keep a low stance and a tight defense....keep your hands up, but remember to keep your eyes open and look for openings.    this will prepare you to counterpunch your opponent. just taking a backwards step or to the side works or shooting a stiff quick jab or jab/straight right whenever your opponent moves forward to throw the combos also works because he's coming and will push himself right into your punches......    if he's a runner u must pressure him very hard and not give him the opportunity to open up with constant combos of your own....a relentless body attack and good head movement will help you....but be prepared to eat alot of leather if you're slower than him, so remember keep those hands tight on your chin.    for more info go to youtube and check out these fighters....    marlon starling vs anybody  simon brown vs. terry norris  julio cesar chavez vs meldrick taylor  salvador sanchez vs azumah nelson  jake lamotta vs ray robinson 1|`|a4c7XSWHaa	go to the body ALOTTTT, keep him moving and counter...easyy bro|`|e9ARhomFaa	hey dude,  if he's throwing lots of fast combinations at you, stay on your  defensive and try to counter attack by moving around the ring and  slipping his lead hand. If your fitter than he is, try tire him out by drawing him to you and by not staying in the same spot. If he is fitter than u are, get inside and use your feet to corner him, but keep those hands up when the combos fly. Good luck!!|`|xk5movogaa	run poof|`|AA10182508	There are many ways to approach against combo-happy boxers.  There are also many things to consider.  Firstly, is your opponent really that fast and fit? Does he hit hard even in combo punches?  If he is not that fit and his combo punches are not really hard punches. Just box defensively, box on your toes and if possible, let him catch air. He will tire eventually and slow down. Aggressive combo boxers usually dash in and throw. Analyze their favorite combo techniques. Just disrupt their rhythm with counter jabs and counter straights. It will give them something to think about everytime they dash at you. Learn to sidestep, dash backward, bob/weave, duck, and circle. The point here is to tire the fool.  But if he seems to be a cardio machine and too fast in hand speed and his punches are hard even in combinations, you better bridge the distance and fight inside... be a brawler/slugger. Corner him if possible. Fighting inside will limit his combo opportunities. Attack the body with powershots.
6nY99hPmaa	he deserved it no doubt.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Yes|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	yes he did|`|LV9l8EFkaa	dear god wrestling's gay|`|TWQNYhVVaa	He did,since Matt is turning heel|`|eGCWuY4raa	No he did not deserve it.  I think that this storyline is stupid!  I really wanted Matt & Jeff to team up to face Edge & Christian, whenever he returns.  That would have been great, but instead now it's just another person jealous of the fact that Jeff was finally getting some of the success that he deserves.    Wake up Vince or whoever came up with this idiotic idea and smell the coffee.|`|AA11634270	definitely he was asking for it.|`|YFE3pCM6aa	Well, I like Jeff Hardy a lot... But, Matt NEEDED to turn heel. So, yes. I think Jeff deserved it, and Edge deserved the WWE Championship. So, I think this will lead up to something, and if this didn't happen, Matt would still be that crappy face he has been for the past years...|`|l6g3moiEaa	Yup, he deserved it. Jeff was getting way too full of himself, especially after matches like the one at One Night Stand vs. Umaga. Outdoor finish, indeed... No, seriously, I wouldn't say he deserved it, but Matt couldn't have chosen a better time or way to go heel. It was shocking, it was all messed up, and it was a much better way to lead into the Hardy vs. Hardy feud than the last time they used the angle. That was frickin' sweet, and will be one of 2009's best of the year moments.|`|xtdvV4Ekaa	hell no he was living the dream and matt hardy ruined it im still asking my self why he did it|`|xnhBucrjaa	deff.not he didn't do anything to Matt.if anything Matt was just jealous cause he doesn't have the ecw title anymore.

I guess he is getting a little on in years but he only wrestles part time, so that enables him to "recover" from injuries better than other wrestlers.  Shawn Michaels is a good candidate to have his hair cut (!) Taker had it short during the Bro's of Destruction days and it looked good. So at least we know it won't turn the gals off.  I think the long hair is all part of the deadman gimmick though.  Come to think of it, age may be the best thing for his whole "deadman" role!|`|aTKKg9nHaa	Do you even hear yourself?

92MSZ54Naa	I'm not sure if you mean touch footy (aussie rules) or touch rugby.    For touch footy the rules are basically the same as normal footy except there is no tackling, instead you 'touch' the player with the ball and they have 3 seconds to dispose of it or they are penalised.     In touch rugby the tackle is replaced with a 'touch' as well.  After each touch the player who was touched rolls the ball under  his foot and the game continues. After six touches there is a turnover.|`|t2Ns8Tcoaa	well you have to be a good mover and athletic to be good at it, you have to have agility(ability to change direction quickly) and just fast in general.

xhPKkkELaa	Surfing is an activity that should only be practiced by someone who is comfortable in the ocean, with its rips, currents, and sometimes BIG waves.There are already way too many dangerous people in the water. A danger to themselves and other surfers. Don't join their ranks.     Build up your ocean swimming skills. All 5 of my grand children (ages 5-9) are learning to surf, but they are getting at home in the ocean first.    Professional lessons are the only right way to start surfing, unless you have surfing pals or surfing family ( Dad, Mom, siblings?) who can teach you . You have to learn surf etiquette (so the experienced surfers in the line up don't want to drown you), how to paddle and take off on a wave, and how to ride a wave. The worst thing you can do is just rent a board, and go out and get in the way of experienced surfers. It's dangerous. They will either collide with you, or if you annoy them enough, they will seek you out and strangle you. I was 14 when i started surfing, way back in 1966, and we didn't have the advantage of lessons then. Believe me, start with lessons and you will become competent in no time.     Don't even think about buying a board. You can rent one to learn on. Then, if you decide you really want to keep surfing, the folks in a good local surf shop can help you pick just the right board. Don't even think about buying one on line, you'll just be disappointed. And, if you possibly can, avoid buying a 'pop-out' or board made in a far eastern sweatshop.    Be very careful of what you read here on line. Some of the folks who answer on this site are very nice young folks, but not really very experienced surfers. In fact some of the folks who are giving you advice may not know as much about surfing as you do. After I found this site, I figured that I could answer a few questions, and spread the 'good news' of surfing. I think that after 42 years, I may have picked up a good idea or two.

Becoming a good surfer can take three months or three years depending on how often you surf.     The Surfboard Man  http://ww.thesurfboardman.com|`|UMg1CL7baa	im also learning, just start off getting used to the water, then pick a day when the waves arent too rough, and give it a go.|`|Ky99KA8Raa	no dont start|`|r1FX4xfMaa	well first, you should always learn from an experienced surfer so your style is good. you should start out learning to surf by using a longboard, mini mal, or fun board. these are the best learning boards. you can learn on a shortboard or fish, but it will take a lot longer and you will have not as good a style. it takes a while to learn how to surf very well, but as long as you keep surfing and practicing, you will get the hang of it in no time. you should always surf with friends. if you are worried about sharks, dont be. they are in the water with you, no matter where you go. but there is such a small chance of running in to one, you are more likely going to get hit by a tv falling out of a window than getting attacked by a shark. when you are learning, go to a surf shop or lessons and see if you can rent a board. they usually have good beginner boards. when you buy your boards, you need to go to a surf shop too. they will help you get the best boards and equipment for your beach and skill level. if you are surfing somewhere like california when the water is cold, you need to once again, go to the surf shop and buy a wet suit that fits perfectly. you can not return wetsuits once you buy them. make sure it is thick enough.     now when you are getting out ready to surf, observe the waves first. you need to know how big they are. practice pop ups on the sand before you go in the water. your pop ups need to be in a quick, swift motion. once you are ready to paddle out, grab your board and head out into the water. when you paddle out, try to paddle in a place where the waves are not breaking so hard. be careful not to head out into a  rip current though. you have to be a strong swimmer to surf. if you do get caught in a rip, swim parallel to shore until you are out and then swim to shore.     when you are out in the line up, know the surfing etiquitte. never snake someone. if you see another surfer in need of help, dont just sit there. go help him. the person closest to the peak of the breaking wave has the right of way. dont hog all the waves. no matter how big a wave is that is comming toward you, do not ditch your board. it is a hazard to you and the people around you. hold on to it. learn to duck dive or turtle roll. dont hate boogie boarders or body surfers unless they snake you multiple times and dont apologize.     alright, now that you know the rules, you can go and catch your wave. when you see your perfect wave, paddle toward the shore. if you are riding a shortboard, paddle at and angle toward shore. do not stop paddling until you feel the power of the wave start to push you. when you feel it, put your hands flat under your chest (on the rails if you have a shortboard) and do the quick, swift pop up that we talked about earlier. then you will catch a wave. this takes a lot of practice to catch a wave, so dont be discouraged if you fail multiple attempts at it.     that is mostly all there is. good luck and have fun. if you have any questions, feel free to emal me|`|KkkugCJ0aa	just get out there and catch the whitewash on your stomach for about half an hour..then come on here and ask how to do a pop up and try that on the whitewash..do that until youve got it down..by then, you;'ll know what to do next|`|minZf9Jkaa	First of all, which coast do you live on? If you're west coast, get a longboard for sure otherwise the waves are too big and you'll never get up to start. If you're east coast you can get a middle of the road length, big enough that you can get up, but smaller because the waves are smaller and soon you'll be bored with it. Go to a decent shop like RonJon because they have sales and ask for a med board and they'll assess your weight (heavier needs bigger board) and help you choose one. If you buy used make sure it's not got bondo or not cracked. Cali and Fla you can pretty much buy one on Ebay and drive to pick it up (well, I assume you won't drive, maybe your parents?) and then you'll want to take it out near a pier (that's where all the surfers hang out all along Florida) and you'll get some great tips from fellow surfers. If they're jerks just watch them. You learn more from trying and falling and watching than anyting else. You probably wont do more than squat the thing in the first day, but youll stand up eventually and then you can start working some leans to get some maneuvers down. Have fun.|`|11AbYuo2aa	maybe you should go bake something instead....|`|x9mVQwKLaa	No its not hard if u practice and are in the water. U should go to a local family owned surf shop and ask if they have lessons. ask them to recommend a board thats easy to learn and easy to get good fast.

rjEnFSAIaa	You don't say what driver you're using currently or what prices you've found on the new drivers you list. If you can stretch another year out of your current driver, do what the others say and put the money towards a lesson or five.    If you really need a new driver this season, it sounds like any of the drivers you listed would be ok for you. You might consider getting your swing examined (speed, angle of launch, etc) at a local pro shop. They'll tell you what the optimum shaft and loft should be, which could make the decision easy for you.    At the end of the day though, it's whatever makes you comfortable and confident when you're standing on the tee box.     Best of luck!|`|b58d04638a47803379a69592979765f5aa	I like the question- "i am buying a new driver?"

AA12170560	Define "a lot of money".    I was a Personal Trainer making $50 dollars an hour...  great money right?  Well, most of that goes to insurance.    As a school's Strength and Power coach - I made the same salary as my peers at entry level education. I lived in a depressed economy, so getting paid less than a Police Officer was fine...but it wouldn't have been enough to pay the bills in...say...my home state of California.    Getting to pro level, I'm pretty sure that pay is commensurate with experience AND dependent upon the team's philosophy.  At Semi-pro level...I am the strength coach and I do it for free.  No Pay.    I hope that helps.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Yeah cause they get the top athletes and develop them and build up their reputation. How do you think they own their own gyms/facilities. Defranco is awesome.

hCaotAlCaa	You should be OK.  You did not mention the length of the skis.  For a beginner, you should try to go with shorter length, but since you said you are taller than your mom, it may not be an issue because bigger and taller people generally need longer skis anyway.      If you are also using your mom's boots, I suggest that you do not tighten the buckles too much,  The difference between beginner and expert skis is much less than the difference between beginner and expert boots, and usually it has to do with the stiffness of the boots.  The stiffer they are, the more responsive they will be.  This is so because expert skiers will want to have even small shifts in body weight translate instantly to the ski edges.  If you leave them just a BIT loose (not too much, just keep them comfortably snug), you would negate this effect.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	I suspect that your mother's expert skis are quite tall and have very little  "sidecut" to them.  Take them to a shop and have the bindings checked for reliability and have them tuned before you use them.  If the shop will not adjust the bindings to your boots, then the whole package should be replaced.  Find the money to rent a good package of skis/bindings and boots.  The modern skis are much easier to use and much shorter than what your mother used even 5 years ago.  Take a series of lessons from a qualified professional instructor.  The money is well spent and it is much safer than trying it yourself and risking a leg injury.|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	You should be able to ride them, especially if you're taller than her.|`|mdzIjOqaaa	Then you will ski like an expert. I bought the NFL edition football and was drafted the next day. I also bought some expert roller blades and now I can tear it up in my fruit boots.|`|TFhf5skNaa	Better equipment is better and can only help.    The skill levels(I, II, II) are used to meter skill, but the biggest difference will be the settings on the bindings.   A beginner will have the settings on the bindings allow you pop out easier.  This is done to protect the beginner in the event of a fall.  The setting is higher(tighter) for an expert.  The thinking is an experienced skier might be jumping or riding more technically, and would not want their ski popping off    Unless you fall and get up more than you ski, I wouldn't worry.  If you want to play it safe, take them to a ski shop; before the trip, or to the rental shop at the mt.  It will take the tech two minutes to set them for your skill level.  You might be able to find a video on youtube.  I found a few, but the were binding specific, and I don't know what you have.|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	it is good that you are taller therefore you will be able to turn the ski easily but expert skis usually have big side cuts so keep turning or you can easily catch an edge and fall... and keep on the little runs.|`|z3erL0DIaa	I'm certainly no expert skier, I've been 3 times total.  But from what I understand, the more skill you have the longer the skis will be.  Therefore, for your experience level you should have shorter skis than what your mom is offering.  The longer skis will be harder to control for you at this point.    If that's your only option at this point, then you may want to go ahead and try it.  But do realize that if this occasion is miserable, it was the skis and not the sport.  Try again with the proper equipment next time.

PCpMqpP3aa	if you are on a limited budget the raleigh bike is probably the better, but the more you spend the more you are likely to carry on cycling, as a heavy bike with poor quality accessories like your gears and brakes makes it seem like hard work, a good quality aluminium framed bike is a good starting point which then you can then slowly upgrade as you become more interested is the route which i took.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	are you tall enough to ride a 20" frame? i'm 6-1 ride 18-19" . the raleigh if it's a rigid or suspension in front only.|`|qMBYdRudaa	well it depends A lot on what type of mountain bike riding you wish to do. I used to do A lot of downhill fast technical stuff and the adjustable suspension got in the way. But as for uphill bit the adjustable suspension was a real help. I now prefer it to just have front suspension but it depends A lot on your own riding style.|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	Not the Harlem.  Front and rear adjustable suspension?  I assume that your budget is about 200.  Disc brakes?      Consider.  Most full sussers with discs will, by a reputable manufacterer, start at about 800.  The Harlem is trying too hard to get all of the boxes ticked.  Guese what this means for component quality.    The Raleigh suffers from similar problems.  They are reasonable starter machines, but useless if you really want to get fit.    The mountainbike specific arm of the Raleigh stables are Diamondback.  Raleigh have launched their own named stuff because they are a familiar name.  Don't do it.  Go with diamondback as spend about 230.    This will get you a basic hardtail frame, with viable alluminium.  The fork will be a bit basic as will the components, but it will do the job.    However, I would be tempted to spend about 350.  This will get you a nice Specialized with 28 gears, a good frame, viable forks and finishing kit.  It will also be about 1/2 the weight of the Raleigh and your components won't fall to peices as soon as you point them at a hill.    The wheel size doesn't matter, other than performance.  The measurement that matters is the frame size.    Stand over the bike you are interested in.  You should have about 2 - 4 inches between the top bar on the frame and your jewels, with your feet about a foot apart.  When you extend the seatpost, your leg should almost lock out on the lower rotation.  If the seatpost extends beyond the safety limit, your frame is too small.  If it sits at its lowest point, or there abouts, it is too big.  Remember, your seatpost adds to the suspension of the bike by flexing.    Make sure that your components are branded.  Shimano, SRAM, Mavic, Truvativ, etc.    Go to these web sites and see what is on offer:    www.evanscycles.co.uk  www.rutlandcycling.co.uk  www.paulscycles.co.uk  www.leisurelakes.co.uk  www.pitsfordcycles.co.uk    The brands that you are interested in are Trek, Scott, Giant, Specialized, Claude Butler, Dawes.    Failing that, go to your local bike shop (Not chain) and tell them what you want to do and how much you want to spend.    Luck|`|KXkvElYpaa	.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	I doubt very much that you want a bike with a 20 inch frame. You need to be about 6 foot tall.  I would visit the local bike shop and get a good bike that will fit you.  I would look for a hard tail bike with about 24 speeds.  Most of the 21 speed bikes will have a free cassette while the 24 speed will have a free hub which is much better.    If you are going to ride on the road and bike paths mostly, I would look at a comfort/pathway bike instead of the mountain bike.  It will be more comfortable and liter.  Also take a look at the hybrid bikes, they are great for getting into shape.    http://www.raleighusa.com/bikes/hybrid/r...  http://www.raleighusa.com/bikes/comfort/...
f0140b5bbcf0956256d93d9d85372448aa	Ive worked 2 seasons in sauze doulx which is on the other side of the milky way. I worked for neilson and did a ski way day to monty every week.   It is a brilliant ski area for all abilitys, the snow is great, and the resort is very nice. There is a neilson chalet that is next to one of the gondola's, i cant remember what its called but check it out on there web site.  Last season, your the monty lift pass covered all week in monty and claviere which is the neighbouring italian resort, and for only one free day in the rest of the milky way.   You can ski across to sauze doulx which is the furest resort away from monty and back in a day, however on the way there you will spend a lot of time on lifts, and it will take up most of the day.   So leave early and dont hang around in sauze b4 coming back. Your best bet is to get the local bus to sauze via oulx bus train station, and ski back, as theres more skiing coming back than going over. It takes about an 60mins maybe more to get the bus to sauze. If there 12 get 2 taxis, as splitting the cost wont be much more. Let me know if u want to know more info, sorry i dont know about the chalet, eddie

Snipers are people....you can't buy people.    The best sniper rifle's are the ones personally upgraded. These can be Maruzens or TM VSR-10's. These guns take hours of tweaking and loads of cash. But if you want it to perform well you have to put in the cash and the time.    Check out the JG bar http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  It is one of the better sniper rifles out there because of its compatibility with vsr parts (which means it can be upgraded to where it will actually perform as a sniper rifle).|`|S10v9NJiaa	Where do you live?

FGiw7fgOaa	Having carefully analyzed the countries in the running, I would say that Australia is in a good position to receive the 2018 bid, and either England or Mexico for the 2022 bid.  I believe that Australia's surprisingly good performance in the 2006 WC, its economic stance, infrastructure capability, and history of never having held a world cup before makes them a top contender for a nomination.  Next, I would say that England is definitely a top contender for a bid having already the infrastructure, football history, transportation, and simply is always reliable and logical choice that hasn't hosted the WC in some time now. Some setbacks might include, that England is holding the next Summer Olympics 2012, therefore FIFA may decide to grant some other country an opportunity to set a world event.  Lastly, I believe Mexico will contend England's bid. Given that Australia takes the 2018 nomination FIFA may decide that some diversity may be welcome after an English speaking country having hosted the previously WC. Not only that, Mexico has proved to be a reliable country to host World Cups twice. Moreover, many Mexican clubs are currently undergoing or have plans to improve their venue infrastructures. Its close proximity with the US may also help it grab media attention from the US, thus also helping promote football there too.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	As the host nation gets seeded,the bid should go to a country that would get such a seeding anyway,so Australia is a no go - also too far for everybody to travel to get there and to get around the different venues.   Bid should go to England -its got the grounds,the transport infrastructure (you can get from anywhere to anywhere by train the same day).The other European countries have all hosted a big tournament relatively recently.England has only had 66 WC and 96 Euro championship|`|DTzWlHqwaa	What sport? If soccer its too soon to think about that its like 3 world cups away|`|Hn8o4G9jaa	it shouldnt go to europe,france hosted in 1998 and germany hosted in 2006.Australia is the best place to hold it.Australia has the infrastructure in place to cope with large crowds as sydney showed when the Olympics were held there in 2000.It would be a great boost for oceania football to bring the superstars of world football to our doorstep and  agreat chance to see them live instead of on TV.|`|355532df94e51c374162e8452be608daaa	although US held it in '94, hosting it in 2018 or 2022 would be a great way to popularize the ever growing fans here.....although it would still be not enough to make football the most popular here.
c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	1) He is not a good fielder, period. He is a DH, who strikes out too much.  2) I. Rodriquez has little power, and he would make a terrible DH.  3) Piazza is gone. Great hitter, let him live in peace.  4) Martinez has little left. I saw him pitch, or really sit for most of the 4 years with the Mets. I am not a doctor, but I do not believe he took rehab seriously, and the Mets let him do whatever he wanted and provided no oversight He pitched at the tail end of the season and was terrible. He had no fastball and pitched on guile and was crafty.  5) Hughes was terrible last year. He has "good stuff" and throws hard, and has great potential. After last season the Yankees do not trust him as their 5th starter, and have 5 pitchers ahead of him.  Have a nice day!|`|h0LR993Uaa	1. Dunn really can't field. He just can't... I don't think it would help anyone to make him a 1st baseman.    2. No way... Pudge really has little to no power and, in my opinion, he's over the hill now. He's really only worth as much as he can give defense wise.    3. He had an amazing career but I think he's done - bringing him back would be like milking a dry cow, if you get the analogy.    4. Nope, I don't think he's going to make it 2-3 years. In my opinion, the man's washed up. In his prime, he was definitely a great pitcher but I wouldn't sign him now, he's done.    5. I agree - Hughes isn't trained up yet but if they can get him into starting shape, he can definitely handle being the 5th starter. He really has the "stuff" as they call it. I think that with a little time for practice and improvement, he could be a very welcome addition to our rotation.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Dunn...I just cant see this guy being anything but a liability in the field. Dosent matter where you try to hide him. The man should be signed on a low market ball club as a DH for 1-2 years at a decently cheap price! With how much the market is down he should be signed for around $8-10m per year.    Pudge...Did you see him the second half of last year? Did you see him "try" to hit for the Yankees. At this point he would serve best as a mentor to a young catcher & a backup. DH's dont bat that close to the Mendoza line. Pudge was great in his prime....but he isnt an eliete or even a good player for that matter any more. His biggest asset is his experience!    Piazza...Hell you might as well bring back Sosa or Bernie Wiliams if you want to relive the old days. Players who miss a season dont come back very often or well. There is a reason for that. Piazza was an amazing hitter when he played & he didnt do all that bad when he DH for Oakland. He dosent really seem to want to play anymore, would you want to pay a man whose heart wasnt really in playing? I sure know I wouldnt!    Pedro...Hmmmmm, injury prone as they come now, questionable when he is on the mound, velocity is virtually non existant, hasnt made 30 starts in how many years? I would only sign him if it was to an incentive deal & ONLY for 1 year. It would have to be a base salary for less than $4m garunteed, you just dont know what you are going to get. However if he could get over all his injuries  & find a way to get it done...he would be a steal at $4m. The likelihood is virtually zero that he would do it...but he would be a risk similar to John Smoltz!    Hughes...He didnt do so well early on last year. He has absolutely dominated in minors in his whole minor league carer. He has a plus curve ball & he has good acuracy when he is on. He was a little overrated on his fastball though. He is an average 92-94mph they made him out to be speed averaging 95-97. He played through the pain of a broken rib last year which I belive obviously had to hurt his numbers. Once he came back at the end of the season & was over his injury he looked great. His game against the Blue Jays was a masterpiece. In my eyes his getting some more time in the minors is the best thing for him at this time. If nothing else let him get his confidence back up before we give him his next shot. Once somebody goes down in the rotation I belive Hughes will get the first call up.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	I AGREE W/ DUNN. AND RODRIGUEZ.   PIAZZA JUST FLAT OUT SUCKS AND PEDRO IS WAY PAST HIS PRIME.  I HATE THE YANKEES SO I HOPE HUGHES IS THEIR 5TH STARTER.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Dunn should only be a DH. He needs the American League badly. He has no glove skills whatsoever, the quintessential T-ball hitter.     Ivan's best offensive days are done. His only value is the fact that he's still a tremendous catcher    Piazza's done. Well done. Bringing him back would just be embarrassing    Same thing goes for Pedro. If he could stay injury free, he'd probably have another 3-4 years, but he can't.     Phil Hughes, well he's a joke. Another in the long line of pitchers with talent that could never put it together. He'll probably stick around in middle relief for the next 10-15 years. I just don't think he had the mental qualities a starter needs.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Dunn - You could give it a shot but it would take a lot of off-season work and extra work which I don't see Dunn doing. He is a guy who likes to hit and strikeout.    Rodriguez - Tough call for a guy who can control a staff like he does. If he can still catch then I would have him catch. Its such a shame that this guy isn't producing like he could.    Piazza - Old and really can't hit that well anymore.    Martinez - 2-3 good years? I don't think so. The guy has to change his whole pitching style. He used to be able to throw a nasty heater that had a lot of get up. Now he has to pitch like Maddux, and there aren't too many guys that can.    Hughes - I'm not sure if he is a 5th starter but I would want him on my team or in the organization|`|5EuOTAjJaa	All five options are terrible.  Why so coy with your opinion?  I thought our baseball forum here had some informed thinking members.
Pq5Ds8F2aa	Sorry for mugging your "?"    Gotta love Ray he and Avery are our Paris & Britney in these parts.|`|385N0ZXaaa	Sounds to me like both might of gone overboard.    Unless there is some team rule that says hats are mandatory for goalies on the bench however, I would have to say though that the trainer was in the wrong.    Edit: After seeing the video, Both are in the wrong.  The trainer should of just let him go, and Emery should of calmed the hell down.|`|HNEWf7ILaa	He was being a bad boy!|`|qdg8G12Iaa	The trainer had a crazy look in his eye.I think he couldve taken Emery.That would've been a fun fight to watch!|`|ppFQazEoaa	What happened was Emery got pulled so he was upset and the trainer was forcing him to put the hat on.  Emery said no and wanted to cool down a bit and then the guy tried to put the hat on and Emery flipped.    lmfao|`|YJi66M5Gaa	It was a Celine Dion hat.  Ray doesn't like her.  Simple.|`|VC5mEULTaa	I caught it during the Sabs-Flames game yesterday on TSN.... I missed the beginning and was trying to figure out who it was(name on the jersey didn't help much). I didn't know it was Emery  LOL    he's a nutcase|`|brd6l4MAaa	**THUD**...was that the sound of the other shoe dropping? I had the feeling it would be just a matter of time before Razor's personality would express itself.    Does this mean that more people will be looking into the possiblity of bringing Esche back to the NHL? One hopes, even as much as it would take a chip off my heart to see Chico in blue and white.    My fault I wasn't more clear- Esche has the numbers below|`|G33E41IBaa	Dang...Video doesn't work :(    Emery was sent to Russia, in part, for his delinquent behavior.  So whatever he's pulling is putting him into a bigger hole.  I mean, you can disagree with someone but you don't attack them...|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Great job...so what NHL team wants this guy on their roster?  Phone lines are open, kids!|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	I'm asking myself two questions    1)  Did the trainer know anything about Emery's boxing background?    2) Did the trainer know anything about Emery's cantankerous attitude?    If the trainer answered yes to either of the above questions............what the %$@$ was he thinking?    In order for a player to be eligible for the NHL playoffs, he must be signed by the trading deadline, and there has been a lot of interest in Emery.  Maybe, just maybe, Emery is trying to accelerate/facilitate an early flight back to NA.      Either way, we can't count on Emery to do the right thing, so we shouldn't be surprised.    I wonder what the drugmobile of choice is in Russia?                  Bob - if the Russian mafia can screw with the heads of Mogilny and Bure from across the ocean as they did 10-15 years ago, I'm sure taking out Emery would be easy when he's right there.      As for low GAAs.  Belfour played in the Swedish First Division last year (not the Elite League) and posted a sparkling 0.61 GAA in 13 games with 10 shutouts  - but that would be similar to Ovechkin playing a year in Junior B.  Looks great, but when the competition is taken into account - perspective is needed.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Sounds as if he is playing very well, drugs and a 1.92 GAA don't really go together.  Being a jerk didn't stop Roy from being a succesful goalie. Emery may be flaky, but the team can likely find a new trainer more easily that a goalkeeper of his calibre.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Darn hats, cause so much trouble I just had a visual of the comedian Ron White's drunk in public bit.  Nothing to do with Hockey but its funny as hell.    Emery losing it is not surprising but the trainer needs to stop and think.  The guy was pulled, he is upset let him cool off- don't try to put the hat on his head.  Now I'm picturing Mario Tremblay in 1995 try to put a Habs hat on Roy...    Edit    Emery seems to have learn't not to fight teammates or coaches.......go for the training staff.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	I would still take Emery sure he's firey but it brings in more goalie fights which brings up money which brings up the revenue of hockey.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	What a huge mistake on Emery's part. It may seem minor to people... but whatever optimism any NHL general managers had that Ray's disruptive behavior was behind him just went out the window.    That was probably a million dollar mistake.|`|LEQowzHCaa	Ray Emery is a DICK!|`|naZQqrNeaa	I heard that incident happened after Emery let 5 goals go past him and he was pulled.  Emery is toxic to hockey everywhere......I am willing to bet that he will be in jail in 3 years.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Not excusing Emery's behavior, but where does a trainer get off telling a player what to do?|`|9gVPOsrhaa	umm .. maniac xDD no offence .
tIBZ9Gi3aa	I think it's just unsportsmanlike behavior.If the reports were true,then the Jordan team would be lucky the FAS chose to keep this incident low-key.They could have blown the whole thing up and cause Jordan to be suspended from the tournament,or at least fined.They lost because they were the inferior team,so take your loss like a man and try to win the next match.I hate teams that encourage unsportsmanlike behavior.I remembered in 2007 when Thailand walked off the pitch after conceding a penalty to Singapore,and in 2007 as well,in the Champions League,when Lille walked off the pitch to protest when Man United scored from a quick free kick.It's sickening and it's a slap to the face of the spirit of the game.    1) If Inter incited the fight,then both teams would get fined.If United started the fight,both teams would get fined,plus United players would get suspended.Since United's a cash cow for UEFA,they can't afford to suspend the team,so they'll suspend the players instead to screw United and still make money.    2) If Real started the fight,then both teams would be fined,and Real would appeal to UEFA,and when their appeal is overturned,they'll take it to the CAS,because they think it's their birthright to be unpunished.If Liverpool started the fight,then they'd probably get banned from playing.|`|mvJXPDLgaa	I tell u what happens man..  those jordanese players come to the game thinking that they will beat singapore easily , so to lose 2-1, some of the players lose their cool and start some fight and stuff..  i hope they get punished.
E4iUcYEjaa	My boyfriend actually was contemplating on buying this shoe the other day, but as it turns out, he didn't feel that they were too comfortable when he tried it on.  He said there wasn't enough padding and didn't feel like good basketball shoes (he plays in a league).    P.S.  Everyone who's saying these shoes are ugly is an idiot - they're basketball shoes.  They're not supposed to be pretty and cool looking, all that matters is if they're comfortable and light on the court.|`|R1zUIh7taa	I don't know anything about those shoes..and it is 10 points!|`|RfA0eMlpaa	i don't like this shoe coz it's not too stylish and the colors r boring i cant tell how much this shoe is durable it depends on how u use it and if my bro uses it it may last for 1 year or 8 months|`|8hIs3dHsaa	Nice shoes.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Well, if you have $120 that you were getting ready to throw in the gutter, then getting these shoes instead is a good idea.  Otherwise I think you're paying $60 for some good shoes, and $60 for Kobe's name and the Laker colors.|`|cGs6ai5Gaa	I don't own that shoe and why do you care so much?

9NRyeif9aa	Orton- House show,i met him Backstage,i was holding a World Heavyweight Championship Replica Belt,he saw me and he said ''WHAT'S UP CHAMP? WANT SOME AUTOGRAPH?'' i said ''SURE WHY NOT'' so he signed my Replica Belt right in the Name Plate and he wrote ''RKO'' so i was like,Thanks Dude! and he nodded and said ''No Problem'' that was like a month ago.yeah,December.    Taker- In a House Show too,Nice and Quiet Guy,he doesn't like ppl who ask Stupid and Non-Sense Questions,but when i saw The Undertaker, he just acts like a Normal Person,you know,the Real Mark Calaway,and not the Scary Undertaker were seeing every Friday Nights on Smackdown.    Trish Stratus- she's Hot,Cute and Nice,same as Orton's,while she's signing for autograph,she gave me a Thumbs Up and she said,''YOUR COOL,WHAT'S YOUR NAME?'',but at that time,Carlito was beside her,and Carly said ''I Know Cool'' and i was just like ''What?'' i laughed and Trish laughed too, pretty cool.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Michelle McCool,very nice.|`|7sa6B6Qhaa	Carlito (He was sleepy at the time, and I didn't get to say much to him.)    Big Show/Mark Henry (bumped knuckles with Henry, sat next to both  for a picture.  Both were nice guys, but it was intimidating as heck sitting between those behemoths.)    Johnathan Coachman (Actually got to talk to him prior to him working with ESPN.  Nice guy, but he did seem a little annoyed or overwhelmed)    Ashley (Total tool.  Glad she got released.  She was at a fan Axxess thing at Wrestlemania. Sat on her phone or MP3 or something, messing with that the whole time.  She never looked up to address fans, she just scribbled an A and some jibberish on their paper.)    Melina (The coolest wrestler as far as personal experience goes that I've met [outside of TNA])    Santino (He wouldn't do the italian accent and actually came off like a jerk.)    Nunzio twice (Made me take his picture one time.  He seemed very needy and dejected.  While I was getting the later mentioned photo with Stevie, he mumbled over Dreamer at the table "I don't have any fans")    Eve Torres (Sweet and very pretty)    Tommy Dreamer (Seemed tired, which I could understand)    Colin Delaney (At the time, it was Wrestlemania weekend, and he just simply seemed humble and excited to be where he was)    My crown jewel, Steven Richards (He seemed astonished that he had a fan.  Let me take a picture with him while people waited in line behind us.  Eff them, they weren't there to see Stevie!)    Other wrestling personalities I've met have been Jeremy Borash, whose quite the awesome guy and a true wrestling fan to his core.  Earl Hebner, whom seemed good humored, but looked really distressed anytime someone brought up Bret.  LAX, the coolest guys in the world, and one of the best in-person wrestler experiences I've ever had.  Taylor Wilde, she was humble.  Kurt Angle.  I think people would be surprised how down-to-earth Kurt can be with the fans.  The Kurt I met contradicts every internet rumor I've ever heard.  He was quite the gentle soul.  Eric Young, who was nice, but was definitely overwhelemed by the fan experience.    On my dresser, I have a picture of me locking in the headlock on Ivan Koloff.  Met him at a mall in Mount Airy, NC.  He's one of the many retired wrestlers whose turned to the ministry for life after wrestling.  I think he's actually doing anti-drug motivational speeches now.  Great guy though.|`|RxRYlOblaa	I have met JBL, Chris Jericho, Jeff Hardy, Kane, Shawn Michaels and Triple H in my dreams!!!!   and it was really cool because I was doing all of these wrestling moves that i can't do, like moonsaults, swantons, and other stuff.|`|q4v9lO6Laa	Jerry Lawler- Great Guy  Kofi Kingston- I think he's smile is serouls y plastered on its just so big and lightes up your day  CM Punk- He was cool, now since i like him in real life, i am now a fan of his  Mickie James- The nicest person you will ever meet.

Angle is a very down to earth guy and spoke at length about how proud he was at winning the olympics, and said about how it was an honour to be working with Jeff Jarrett.     James Storm was a riot! he gave me one of his personalised beercans and he was cracking lots of jokes. He also said the best thing about being a wrestler was knowing that his daughter had someone to look upto and hoped that one day she would be proud of him which, for me (as a parent), was one of the greatest things to hear.    I also met Alex Shelley, Robert Roode and Abyss who were all cool people but only signed autographs etc, didn't really make conversation.|`|97jqpA54aa	I've met Lita she was really nice  Maria she was also nice and sweet  Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy were awesome!!! they cared so much about you  Trish met her the same day I met Lita and she was really nice to

He defeated Tsonga in the quarters, who just happened to beat Nadal at this event in the semis last year. I know that means jack but still, you can't count the dude out. However, if it does come down to Fed-X vs. Nadal, I'm going with my boy Federer. He looks like he really wants number 14.    Edit: My bad "me..".    P.S. You forgot to correct PerfectProcrastinator.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	The Texas race in the chase 2 years ago ended with a great duel between Jimmie Johnson and Matt Kenseth.  It took a bunch of laps for Jimmie to set up Matt and make the pass with 2 or 3 laps to go.  The pass that Carl Edwards made on Jimmie, for his first cup series win, at the spring Atlanta race in 2005 was pretty awesome.  The pass by Kyle Busch on the restart at Chicagoland was fun for Shrub fans but I did not care for it much.  The most incredible moment for me was the spring Martinsville race in 2007, where Jeff Gordon tried to pass Jimmie for 20+ laps but just couldn't close the deal.  He was banging the snot out of the 48's back bumper but could not move it out of the way unless he had wrecked him.  Jimmie did everything he had to to secure the win but I thought he was toast when the 24 dove down inside of him coming out of the last corner.  They were door to door to the line and it was the most exciting finish I have ever seen!  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|iO12Vjnvaa	To me it absolutely is the 2003 Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington where  32 Ricky Craven and  97 Kurt Busch was battling for the win with only a few laps to go....and coming down to the line nose to nose.  To me that was the most exciting race I have ever seen.    Just an opinion as always.|`|muc8sq9naa	Kurt Busch and Ricky Craven was probably the most incredible finish I have ever seen.  Dale Jr. "passing" the pace car was a pretty good pass...LOL...    *JAKD*|`|YHYT8qMKaa	One of my favorite passes would be when Jeff Gordon passed Jimmie Johnson on the final lap of the 2007 fall race at Talladega and won by leading only the last lap. Jeff just drove around the whole race, but he made his move at the right time and it worked out perfect.                                                                                                           One of my favorite driving moments would be when Kyle Busch and Jamie McMurray made contact and just keep on going at Talladega last year. I thought they would wreck for sure, but they did a good job holding on.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeuh5LNiP...|`|xkWLcv62aa	Same as Matt. I was at that very race (Im from N.I. I was on holiday) :)|`|ZHX548Dlaa	My favorite pass isn't just one pass but a series of them. It was in the 2000 Winston 500 at Talladega. Dale Earnhardt Sr. restarted 15th after the last caution. He dropped back to 18th with 11 laps to go. He was back up to 15th with 5 laps to go.    He started his charge through a "Talladega traffic jam" to move from 15th to 1st in 3 laps and took the victory. Sadly to say, this was also his final win. That was a guy who knew how to put a car where a car shouldn't be able to go. RIP Dale.|`|MypygGVJaa	Fire Storm: I remember when Kyle did that, I can't remember how mad I got.    My favorite is the end of the 2007 Pepsi 400.    EDIT: I forgot about that Darlington race. That was an amazing finish.|`|b74c7c820c32f05c280545197fca275faa	My two favorites are two failed slingshot moves:  1) In the '79 Daytona 500, where Cale Yarborough ended up crashing Donnie Allison and taking them both out of the race, with a half-a-lap behind Richard Petty clear to drive past the carnage to win the race.    2) Carl Edwards's failed kamikaze slingshot move against Jimmie Johnson in last year's Chase.|`|1mSgtDmuaa	Mine is when Tony said "here kitty kitty, get you some of this" when he passed Harvick on the backstretch at The Brickyard.|`|2BRZy8Mfaa	I only have some from recent memory.  1. Montoya getting forces all the way down into the sandy pavement at Talladega this fall, and getting back in line without losing a spot.  2. The amazing saves Kyle Busch and Jamie McMurry made at Talladgea when Kyle got shunted out of the bottom line and into McMurry, then McMurry almost getting turned by Montoya as they shuffled to get back in line. There was just sooooo much going on during that almost wreck.  3. Kurt Busch in the Coke-Zero 400 this passed summer when he beat Kenseth to Edward back bumper on the next to last lap. It didn't result in any thing for him, but it just looked cool cause the announcers couldn't believe it.|`|tYRIurqsaa	Ford beat me to it that was absolutely my favorite I laughed my butt off.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbTiGJ_ae...      Other than that it would be "The Finish" Darlington 2003 Craven and Busch.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Bi5mnUM...|`|PUsUnoT1aa	A hard one to answer.  But I would have to say that the Kurt Bush and Ricky Craven door to door banging across the finish line at, I believe Darlington, is one of the best.  That showed what true racing is and what it should be.|`|sluDVLQ1aa	Def Busch/Craven and the Grass Pass|`|B9JU9d1Raa	My Favorite pass or incredible driving moment would be the Richard Petty and David Pearson crashing each other coming off the final turn of the last lap. Petty struggled to refired his stalled car, both cars where stopped in the infield a few yards shy of the finish line. Pearson crept across the finish line in his damaged Mercury at a speed of about 25 miles per hour to win at Daytona in Feb.15,1976     33 years to date of this years Daytona 500 Feb.15, 2009    Look for another Historic Moment to happen this year|`|PbfQEbk8aa	The pass in the grass for sure...|`|5Hh4Stj8aa	The Chase race at Texas had a fantastic duel between Matt Kenseth and Jimmie Johnson.     I'd be also remiss if I forgot to mention the final 10 laps of the 2001 Cracker Barrell 500.|`|kuuw8X1caa	aww come on guys sober up! dont just say it was your favorite pass becuase it was your fvorite driver... i think that most people would agree with me when i say that the bush craven race was "one" of the most incredible last lap passes ever made in the history of nascar, and it is certainly my favorite pass.

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...

But most likely if he keeps doing well and wins the Australian, and Nadal has a couple of tournaments where he goes out early he could possibly over take Nadal during the French Open if Federer can find a way to defeat Nadal on Clay.  Also the rankings are a continuous yearly ranking, and since Federer started a little slow for him last year, every tournament he wins that he didn't win last year will bump-up his pts quicker.  But my best estimate would be if he could win the French Open, would be the earliest he could get his No. 1 Ranking back.|`|LKVTY2EPaa	I don't see him becoming  1. He still did have a great year last year, and really the only thing he can do is win more slams, but that won't do much for his ranking being that he is usually in the finals. The golden days of Federer are over.
