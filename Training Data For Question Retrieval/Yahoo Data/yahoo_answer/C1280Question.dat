I'm doing my coursework at the moment and my teacher has asked us to do an A3 sheet on 'Types of Lighting'. Set out like a brainstorm...anyway, it includes ambient lighting,down lighting, up lighting, spot lighting, candle lighting, task lighting and occasional lighting. I've written information about each of them, e.g. for ambient lighting i've written 'Ambient lighting is similar to the soft, even light that you get on an overcast or cloudy day with very little or no shadow. It is easy to see by but everything looks a little bland without form-defining shadows.'    This is the kind of information i've included for all of them but is there anything else i can add? such as cost...i've looked it up but can't really seem to find anything!

Can anyone think of a null hypothesis for the drug trial data below and how I can use the chi-squared test to support the null hypothesis?      Drug trial data -      Recently a clinical drug trial was carried out on a new anti-HIV treatment which increases the rate of healing of 'seeping wounds' of AIDS sufferers. The medical biologists carrying out the trial implemented a 'double-blind' test. A total of 400 people were subjected to the trial, with two groups of equal-size for each medicine. 200 of group A were given the new drug, X, while 200 of group B were given an existing drug, Y.   At the end of 7 days everyone was assessed.   It was found that 24 of those in group A had their wounds healed.   It was found that 14 of those in group B had their wounds healed.      Can anyone think of a null hypothesis for the drug trial data above and how I can use the chi-squared test to support the null hypothesis?

When ammoniumnitrate is solved in water  NH4+ and Cl- is formed. The solution becomes acidic since H2O+NH4+-->H3O+ and NH3. My question is why H2O "choses" to react with Cl- instead, forming the equation  H2O+Cl- --> HCl and OH-, making the solution basic. I'm not quesioning my result, I am meerely wondering why the reaction is acidic rather than basic.

20090307090933AALs0St	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Has anyone lost 21 grams while in an out of body experience?	A famous study back in 1907 by Dr Duncan MacDougall measured a sudden loss of approximately 21 grams at the moment a person dies. This was a minor study of 6 people and still has some remaining doubt as to being conclusive evidence that humans have a spirit / soul. The ethical implications to repeat and broaden the sample does inhibit further evidence gathering along these lines.       With many people claiming out of body experiences and astral travel and contribute this ability to their soul leaving their body, would you not expect their body to reduce in weight by 21 grams if their soul did actually leave their body?      I would also be very interested in any other legitimate studies or papers that extend of these ideas.

I don't understand implicit differentiation at all.    for example: xy^2 + xy = 12. i know that you have to use the product rule because there are two different variables multiplied by each other, but the product rule is different for implicit differentiation, i think. I thought the product rule was (x)(dy/dx)(y^2) + (x)(dy/dx)(y) = 0, but for y you have to add dy/dx after the y or something like that. I don't know. I just really need to understand how to do implicit differentiation, and the book doesn't help. Thanks.

We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun — the plane of the earth around the sun — the ecliptic.

20090307101324AAkUvQJ	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	What's the deal with infinity in real analysis?	So, I've never taken real analysis, but I've taken multivariable calculus (aka vector analysis), linear algebra, and a couple of semesters of logic.  Never taken any real analysis, as I was a chem major in college.  All this got me thinking of an interesting question.      When discussing limits and continuity, my high school calc teacher put up this function:      f(x) = 0 if x is not rational   f(x) = 1 if x is rational      It made sense that this function was defined for all real x, but continuous for NO real x, since there is a rational number between any two irrational numbers, and an irrational number between any two real numbers.      I want to integrate this function!  In logic I learned that irrationals aren't countable, so it would seem that the integral of f(x)dx from 0 to 1 would equal 0, looking at the integral from an "average value of a function" perspective.  By that logic, the integral of the function EVERYWHERE must be zero.  So if the integral of the function is zero, the original function must have to be an unvarying constant...which my function isn't!  Someone help me with this paradox...it's been burning up my brain as a casual mather...

I have three dogs ( well they are all family dogs because i am 13) one is mine and they other two are my dads and grandmas. My dog hubble is about 4 years and she has a sister named smokey who is also 4. My other dog who is much bigger then them is sen-chi. Anyway smokey attacked hubble and there was an horrible fight in which both of the dog had to be separated by animal control and taken to the vet. Hubble had more damage then smokey but they both got hurt pretty badly. Now they are all separated from each other (including sen-chi) and have to be kept in kennels most of the day. Now i am very worried that my dog Hubble will never be able to be around other dogs again. Hubble is a Black Lab mix and weighs about 48 pounds. She has always been overly playful with other dogs. She has been to the dog park many times as well as being around other dogs. She was fine with all of the other dogs ( except her over playfulness, extreme sniffing,running around a lot taking other dogs toys sometimes etc..) I really want to fix her problem but i don't know where to start. My family are going to go to an animal behaviorist after the dogs go to the vet to get there stitches taken out ( from fighting each other) . I want to know something that i could do now to help her and also what an animal behaviorist might tell me. Please help me i don't know what to do.
