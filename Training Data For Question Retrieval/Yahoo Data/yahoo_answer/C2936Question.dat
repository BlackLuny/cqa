I find it disturbing how many posts there are arguing that scientists that accept AGW are biased frauds just trying publishing whatever will get them money.

Didn't Russia used to be the heart of most conspiracies theories to do us harm in the past!  Wouldn't Russia be at the top of the list for a leftist socialist conspiracy!

20090203142202AAls9bE	Environment;Global Warming	Global warming not real?	the man who made the weather channel said global warming is the biggest scam ever. I happen to agree with the man. Now i think that it is not any of people fault for global warming. To me global warming is the sun fault, because of the more sun spots which make the sun even hotter. Also how would we even have the earth flooded? if you think about it when you have a glass a water with ice in it and the ice melts the water level does not get any higher because that water is taking the ice place. which it would stay the same level.
