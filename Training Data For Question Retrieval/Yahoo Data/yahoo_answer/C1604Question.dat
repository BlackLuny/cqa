We've been looking at Seattle, Ellensburg, and East Wenatchee so far.

We would obviously have to sell most of our stuff and give our animals to someone else. I'll be graduating from high school this year, and I kind of feel like it's time for a change. Higher education isn't too great in most of Arkansas, and there's a lot of drinking and pot smoking in Monticello. Can someone please tell me about Washington and if moving is a bad idea or not?

Thinkiing of teh escape, i was wondering: does anyone know how one can rent a helicopter and how much it costs? Is it simple, don't they check who you are?   Wasn't it a bit suspicious that a not-famously-wealthy woman rented a helicopter to go from Itea to Athens? I mean, I know people who are very wealthy, and they'd have their private chauffeur drive them for such a distance, they wouldn't ask for a helicopter unless it was a medical emergency, which it clearly wasn't, so if you were the helicopter company wouldn't you suspect something? Of course it is easy to suspect afterwards, perhaps I wouldn't have thought of it beforehand either.

I need a county within driving distance from new york ( even if it takes hours ) with an all year round snow fall, with quite a lot of it. It doesn't need to be great amounts of snow, if there arrn't any then could you give me a county that still has snow most months just not that much?      Thanks, SO MUCH!      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

20090223094153AAH2NdH	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Canadian billed with 'sketchy' medical bills- will this affect a trip into US?	I am Canadian and visited the US a few years ago. The trip resulted in me visiting the hospital for a few hours, but i received no medical treatment. Once I got home I received some 'sketchy' medical bills. Where my name and address were located on the bills, someone had white-ed out whatever was previously printed there and had written my name and address (partially incorrect) with a pen in blue-ink. I contacted my travel insurance company and sent them photocopies of the bills, but they denied me coverage and basically told me it was my problem. I thought this was really weird. I had no money to pay for the bills at the time, but i held on to them. After a few months they stopped sending bills to me.    Since then, no one has contacted me to make payments, and due to the forged look of the bills, they have remained unpaid. I am now planning on another trip into the US and am planning on using the same insurance company.   I was wondering if the unpaid 'bills' will affect my ability to get insurance and will this become a problem if i have to go to a hospital during my stay?

20090223083242AAoY9XY	Travel;Austria;Other - Austria	Can you find this Austrian castle? 10 points to whoever finds it?	Small town/village in Austria I believe nestled in a narrow valley with sheer cliffs on either side. There is a castle overlooking in the background. It's extremely picturesque, it makes the entire place look realy fantastical.      I had thought it was in Kitzbuhel, Austria - but no amount of searching on google can help me.      Also I remember that it looks like it's CGI. There are sheer cliff faces on either side and if I can recall correctly, there are certain structures built into the sides of the cliff as well. It looks like a magical place, the sort of place you'd expect to see drawn in that old book Dinotopia or something. It just doesn't look real.      I'm almost certain it's in Austria, but I gave up searching on google images long ago and have spent the majority of my time going through sites that have "amazing places," or "beautiful places," or "beautiful scenery" blogs. but I still can't find it... Has anyone seen this image or can anyone find it??

20090223105200AAyf2nh	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	I want to find a Japanese forum? For young people!?	My dad has been learning Japanese for some years now - I know a little, but I would like to learn more, and maybe chat with some Japanese people of the same age group as me - the sortof 18-25 age group? I think it would help me get into the modern Japanese vibe more.   So thats why i was thinking of a forum - its easy to find them in England, but I can't find anything for Japan-which sucks because I would like to speak to Japanese people.   Any help?      Thankyou : )

20090223104955AADuXIh	Travel;Italy;Other - Italy	Anyone know where I can get a grey ceramic bust of Christ w/blue or red glitter beard?  Saw it in Amalfi Italy?	I know that question is bizarre, but while on vacation last year on the Amalfi Coast, our group stopped in a ceramic shop (McPiccadilly?) on the Amalfi Coast road, in the town of Amalfi.  We were tired and silly and were amused by a shelf of grey ceramic (or stone?) busts of Jesus with red or blue glitter beards.  There were two sizes, but the larger still wasn't taller than a computer speaker.  We are all kicking ourselves that we didn't pick one up, and are trying to buy one.  Can't get a response from the shop, can't even find a pic online.  Help?!

20090223111715AAGBAqk	Travel;United States;New York City	Why is it that people who don't live in new york just think it's all new york city?	It's really annoying to go on vacation and have people ask me where I live because the conversation usually goes like this:   Person: So where do you live?   Me: New York.    Person: Oh! So how's the city?      And it's just really annoying because I always have to say that I DON'T live in the city, I live in a suburban town an hour and a half away from the city. Saying all of New York is a city is like saying all of Florida is Disney World or all of California is Hollywood. So why is it that people from other states think that New York State is just New York City?

20090223111009AAyN4xP	Travel;Italy;Other - Italy	Trip to Italy, some questions.?	I plan on going to Italy in July/beginning of August. For 7-8 days, and I have a few questions.   1) What is the best place to visit? I want to see Rome, and perhaps the vatican.    2) What is the best airport to come into around Rome?   3) How much money should I plan on spending, and how should I carry it?   4) What's the best way to prevent being robbed? (I hear pickpockets are bad in Italy)   5) How common is it for people to understand English? I do plan on using my Italian as much as possible, but since I'm not fluent I feel I may need to use English a few times.   6)Is there anything else I should know before visiting Italy?   Thanks in advance!   One more thing, what is the best way to get around? Should I use a car, bus, motorike etc?
