My agent wants us to sign a Buyer Agency agreement where I pay her a retainer and a "success fee" when we buy a house. I was pretty clear that the agent always makes their money from the commission the seller pays. That's been the way we've seen it in the past.  Is this a new trend or do I need to get a new agent fast?

20070317174013AAaRtBm	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Should I Stay or should I go?	I have just finished an internship at a hospital. I moved up to the bay area to get my schooling and training done. Now that I am done should I stay here where they would offer me a well paying job and security OR should I move back home(i.e. family, friends, familiarity)? If I stay I would be offered a good job but I am essentially all alone up here. If I move I would be close to family/friends but would have to apply for positions and do the whole jumping through hoops interview stuff. Also, being a recent graduate might hinder my chances of getting a job, so I worry about the success I'll have in finding a new job.      But honestly every fiber of my being tells me to move.

A coworker at Wal-Mart I used to get along with one day told me she came to a cartful of apparels returns that she thought were from me. The thing is, it wasn't. I tried to calmly explain to her it was from the overnight crew, but she won't believe me. Then she said it was no big deal. Still, since I didn't get credit for my work, it pissed me off to the point that I exploded at her and verbally abused her and said all sorts of horrible things. She went to mgt saying that I "harassed" her. A few days later, I was still unable to get past it, so I punched the pole in the fitting room in front of customers really hard. Mgt called that workplace violence and canned me on the spot after a customer reported me. They said I endangered everyone at the fitting room bc ceiling tiles coulda fallen and hit someone. Still, should they have fired me or given me a second chance? They said I'm eligible for rehire in 90 days. What are my chances? Since I have anger management issues since I was a kid, shouldn't that be an excuse for my actions? Also, I work very hard for them in my dept and gets lots done every night. Sometimes I get more done than other departments, which I help out with sometimes. With good work performance, shouldn't I be retained?

I am in the middle of an application process for a new job, and have recently had a second interview for a great role. The main interviewer rang me after the interview and said that it was now between me and someone else, but the only reason they weren't taking things forward with me was due to my inability to drive and my comparable lack of experience/youth.    The employer now wants me to come and work with the team (unpaid) for a couple of days and sit in on a variety of meetings. I guess they want to get a feel for what I'd be like to work with, but this all seems like a very odd approach to recruitment - for a not very senior role.   So, I'm wondering whether they are about to offer me the job (and if anyone else has been in a similar position) and also, any tips for securing it during these few days?   Thanks in advance.

Someone from Bank of America from Card Services called and reminded me that I am delinquent. I was expecting that at some point:) He knew the exact amount I owed and I told him I'd pay next week online.      Here is the strange thing: He then asked me for a routing number off my check. I said I didn't have any checks on me and then he asked me again to see if I had a check on me or a deposit slip, so he can get the info in case I guess I didn't pay.      Do banks do this? And since he supposedly can bring up my bank info and know my balance due, couldn't he just simply get my routing number and other info if he really worked there? I lied to him and said I didn't have it because it sounded suspicious.      Was this a phishing scam? I probably sound paranoid but you never know.

20090205110139AAwFv4W	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Would this be careless of me, and could I get in trouble?	Okay, Back in November I was working for ALDI INC but had fallen down my steps and fractured a vertebrae. I haven't been working since and have not been receiving disability money from them because I was 9 days ways from that 90 probationary period. So I haven't had an income since November and even though we were struggling I was waiting to go back to Aldi because of my back. But now do to some family trouble I see myself needing more money so we can afford food and other bills. I have a job interview tomorrow for a secretary job, where I won't have to lift heavy things and maybe give my back more time to heal and as to not hurt it again, because I did a lot of lifting at Aldi. Do you think it is inconsiderate of me to look for another job and to tell Aldi ( if i get this job) that I can't work for them anymore? It's not like they have been paying me during this time off.

Lat year my husband and I decided to get a small loan and put it on are cd so we could use the interest to pay the payments.  Well I think it ended up good because not only is the interest rate locked in a 4.5 until paid.  The interest rates now are like 2.3.  So how can banks do this?

20090205112657AAZkie6	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Need Help with saving money and paying bills! Can Someone Help me????	I'm 20 years old and have at least 8,000 in medical debt. I did have medicaid, but they knock me off when I turn 18. I believe their was a way for me to stay on medicaid by showing proof that I was in school and other documents but I was too lazy to do it. I have been in college for 3 years now and since then I have racked up a hospital bill of 8,000 from going to the emergency room. One bill was for 3500 for a ambulance coming and bringing me to the hospital for breathing problems. My thing is what can I do about this debt and How can I get rid of it. Don't tell me nothing about getting health insurance because I can't afford it nor can my mom. Don't know my dad and living on campus. My mom have 5 other kids to take care of that's get medicaid so I'm not putting the strain on her to pay my medical bills nor get insurance for me. Trying working and going to school but didn't work because I was failing my classes. Classes or too expensive so I'm not going ot waste my precious time on some stupid mimunal wage job to fail school. I'm not a person who can do too things at once. My question is how can I do something about this debt besides getting a job.  I'm trying to get into medical school and me working and class is not an option unless I drop out of school and get a job, then it could work. If I do both I might as well drop out because my classes takes all my time out and I would fell them.    my question is what can I do about this, can I since I'm a college student who is uninsured?with all this medical debt. I have credit cards 4 major ones and they are all over a 1000 for credit limits. they are paid off and put away. I check my credit report and it is perfect except medical bills. I have no lates repo's or anything on my report. My student shows up but they don't count till I finish school in 8 years. I have a car loan on my credit report that my aunt pays off that I drive and it always has been paid on time in fact I only have one more year for that. So in a year's time I will  have a paid off car loan on my report and over 6,000 in credit that is avaible and paid in full with on time payments. I feel bad because I could use my cards to pay off debt , but I don't want to use credit to pay off debt which will soon be debt too. I believe that is how most americans get in debt up to their knee's and I don't want to be one of those people. It is already bad enough when I finish school I will have atleast 150,000 in student loan debt , but that can get paid off in a years time once I become a doctor in 8 years

A few days later i recieved an email from him asking me to call about the quote- i didnt as i decided against having a fence because i have some overgrowing branches that may cause a problem to the fence panels down the line - so i asked for his opinion- he didnt respond- so i left it      yesterday - he came to my house and left a note asking to contact      He seems to be rather pushy - do u think this is a person i should beware of because he maybe crafty if i was to give him the job to carry out and cause all sorts of problems down the line ?

I do have basic business education, a burning desire to start a business, and some cash, enough for the kind of business I plan to start.      The problem is this: I have an uncle whom I thought would be a mentor to me. But he wants to / hints that he wants me to start the new venture (mine) in partnership with him. He aint a bad guy...but mom tells me otherwise not to involve biusiness with relationship. She knows my uncle (her brother), more but sometimes her dicissions are emotional rather than logical . Uncle has been in business for more than 17 years.      What do I do. Should or shoudnt I make him my partner.      By the way Im 23 and I live in India whereas my uncle lives in America. I want to establish the business in India.
