20090205130133AAEuqEv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do people expect my race to be fat?	I am 21 years old and my goal to to be a size zero, people are quick to bring up bone structure.............even though models my height and sometimes with larger bone structure (seen it before) are sizes 0 to 00.      I remember I was on the bus (this happened last year) and this girl was white, and average weight. Her class mates called her fat and picked on her badly!!!! She was like a size 5/6.     I grew up never picked on, people of all races said am healthy and perfectly fine.  Some had the nerve to tell me to lose just have 5 pounds and nothing more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even people at school and the teachers worried that I was now anorexic............I was 300 pounds then...........all because I skipped lunch twice I am now anorexic and they called my home about this!!!    My highest was 310 and yes am smaller!!! But still considered fat and by others losing weight too fast.      Its just a amazing that other races of women are told there fat even if they are within healthy weight range. And me.........am  somehow too small. People are shocked when I tell them I want to lose weight or tell them that I don't like my size. Growing up............before middle school ruined me and I became a emotial eater, I was a size 2!!! So a size 0 is not going to kill me.      But how come its so unfair?  Like today a lady told me to look across the street (a white lady who seemed to be 400-500 pounds) telling me to look at that whale!!!  I was shock and looked at myself. The other lady who pointed out the other was a size 2/4 and saw me as one of the thin girls.    Why is this?    And if anyone is curious and I have no shame since this will be my past, my highest was 310, my new weight is 288. My height 5'10.

20090205130504AAnSR8V	Society & Culture;Languages	How do you say foreshadowing in French?	In English literature, foreshadowing is an example what we call literary devices. They're used to make a written work more interesting, to give it more depth and often to help explain or develop the plot.      Specifically, foreshadowing in a novel is early indications or hints (often vague or hard to spot) of what will happen later in the novel. It's usually easier to spot them much later, I usually don't realize until the plot unfolds and I notice all the clues I was given along the way.      I'm writing an essay for my French Literature class on a book I read that is filled with examples of foreshadowing... but I can't find an equivalent for the word in French.      My prof is French, english is her second language... and she'd never heard of foreshadowing. When I explained, she suggested "prévoir", "to forsee"; but it's not quite the same thing.      The dictionary lists the translation for foreshadowing as "annoncer". Despite my years of french I'm not sure if that's an accurate translation of what I mean or not.      Any help or input on this would be greatly appreciated.   This is my last hope!

This is specifically for those of you who didn't already know your sexuality from early age, and took you time to figure it out.  More specific about the question is:      How has your intimate experiences been with the opposite sex before you knew you were gay/etc? Was it easy for you to get a relationship with the opposite sex? Did people of the opposite sex usually find you attractive and approach you? Or did the opposite sex usually ignore you most of your upbringing?       Like for example, if you were a boy growing up, was it extremely difficult to find girls who would want to date you? Or if you were a girl, was it difficult for you to get guys to date and like you? Or was it all easy and you always had someone of the opposite sex crushing on you?      This is just a further conversation me and my friend was talking about, and thought I'd ask you all some input. Thanks.

Do you think if you had 100 pictures of people with IQ below 80 and 100 photos of people with IQs above 140. Could you find some common traits among each group, so you could say, A lot of the people with IQs below 80 have such and such characteristics, and  A lot of people with IQs above 140 have such and such characteristics?? i.e. intelligent looking eyes? or something? What do you think the characteristics might be?

And its for a social studies class.  This one girl, she gives a long, boring presentation going on and on about some boring Injun american movement for 15 minutes.  So I gave her a D for talking about such boring stuff I never even heard of.  So she asks me why I gave her a low grade, and I explained to her why.  So she starts going on saying how the regular teachers told us on the grade sheet to talk at least 15 minutes, and how she did so much research, and was going on about how bad the other projects were.  So I tell her they got good grades for shortening the presentation down, so I didnt have to be bored sick the whole class.  She wasted 15 minutes of my life.   So she tells her boyfriend, who gives me an offensive nicname.  My last name is Luchius, and now her friends all call me Duchus, with no ms.

20090205133351AAxdY0Q	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	I caught my husband ordering me flowers online for Valentine's day. Am I a B***h for getting mad?	He should know by now, as I have told him, flowers (well the ones sent to me, I'm not knocking flowers if you like that kind of thing) are the most unromantic non-creative gift of all time.  It's not like I am hard to buy for either. I have hobbies and collections he could easily have added to, or at least get me a living plant instead of some cut, dead roses which were quite expensive.  Jewelry, candy even. ANYTHING but cut flowers. It's not like he doesn't know.  I am a very picky eccentric person and I have told him how much I hate flowers. And I know someone is going to tell me i should be happy to get something, but I just can't. It would be like me buying him an expensive necktie for a guy who doesn't wear anything but t-shirts and jeans- an utterly useless gift. If it's the thought that counts, it would indicate to me he is very thoughtless. I don't even know what to ask. I just feel like he doesn't care and doesn't listen to me at all.  His getting me something so stupid is making me feel worse than not getting anything at all.

20090205135925AAZGjN4	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What do I do about a teacher harassing me?	Okay so my English teacher is always picking on me and I never done anything to her. I think it's because of my race and my shyness that she takes advantage of. Because she would let the (not trying to be racist here but using examples) black students talk as loud and as long as they want and she won't even say anything. But when I talk to my friend for no longer than 5 seconds, I get yelled at. And no one can even hear me except for my friend and one classmate asked me why the teacher yelled at me because she didn't hear me say anything. So that's one proof that I don't talk as loud as the black students.      And okay, so, she let one of the black girls call her ugly and she didn't get mad but when I tell MY FRIEND (not my teacher) to stick up the finger (not the finger you're thinking about), the finger she stuck up to another student and she said she's going to report it to the guidance office.... ? Wth is that. She doesn't even know what I'm talking about and she thought I was talking about the middle finger.      Okay, and there's another time where I didn't complete my homework because I was confused by it. But she claims that I was being "LAZY" and just ignored me. So I spoked to my biology teacher about this and she said that I'm not lazy and don't let her get to me.      Idk, what to do because it seems like everyone likes this teacher except for me because they think that a RUDE teacher is considered "cool." I want to report her for what she's doing but then I'm scared that everyone would get mad at me if she gets fired or something.      This teacher is completely rude and she doesn't even act her own age. She would make up rules like "Don't say shut up" , "Don't say gey", "Don't be mean to other students" , "Respect what others have to say". Okay, so she says shut up and doesn't respect me. Um.... seems like she doesn't even follow her own rules....

20090205135752AAQM3xx	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is this rude, or is it ok?	I live in a university dorm and the walls seem like they are paper thin.       I chose to live in the quiet house of the quiet hall, and have been living here since I enrolled (I'm now a junior). My neighbors, with whom I share a bathroom, did not want to be in the quiet house or hall and it shows.      They are quite obnoxiously loud, even for freshmen. I know that everyone can expect some noise, but these girls are way out of line. They turn up their music so loud that my eardrums feel like they are about to break, they get drunk and have like 7 friends over, and three or four nights a week they will yell at each other and hit/shove. Two nights last week the screaming and hitting and slapping was so bad that I almost called the police for their own safety. They also move their furniture around a lot.      I make every effort to be quiet... I never listen to my stereo out loud, and whenever I listen to any sort of music or watch anything on my computer, I use headphones. I don't talk at all, nor do I move around much, and I certainly don't move my furniture about, get drunk, or have tons of loud friends over.      So, what I am asking is, is it rude for me to knock on our shared wall when they are making way too much noise like that?

Seeing how both Jews and Christians are indeed still teaching their neighbors about the Lord...How in any way shape or form could the NT possibly be in effect?  Not only does it outline the new covenant but it says what will happen as a result and uh, those results just are not happening.  The Jewish community isn't in contradiction here but the Christians sure as heck are.      I don't need to hear the typical atheist/non-believer criticisms. I was a believer for over 30 years and it was reading the bible in context, without all the apologetic rhetoric, that brought me the truth.

20090205145537AA31OK0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should children be taught religion?	Since I asked I'll answer first.      I am a deist/agnostic that leans toward Celtic/Druidic Paganism.  I have a 16 year old son that I've raised with the help of my mother who was raised in the Church of God and is now nonpracticing and my father, a Christian who is a 32nd degree Master Mason that believes their teachings that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and she's the Holy Grail.      I have taught my son the Christian traditions surrounding Christmas and Easter, but have never taken him to any of the Druidic rituals I've attended, I felt uncomfortable exposing him to the sexuality of some of them.  He now attends a non-denominational Christian church 3 days a week.  He's attempted to discuss religion with me but as I said, he's a Christian.  He doesn't like it when I poke holes in his pastors stories.  I'm hoping as he gets older he gets a little more logical in his beliefs, but he's free to make his own choices about it.      How about you?

20090205143356AAKnFeL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is freedom of religion abused too often by scam-artists?	Sure, the opposite of freedom of religion is bad; a state religion where people are forced to worship as they’re told is a very bad situation and calls up images of the Dark Ages. But in a society where there is freedom of religion, people abuse it and they invent religions which are a bunch of freakin lies and are blatant money making scams and this has a very negative affect on society. So, freedom of religion gets abused and the opposite of freedom of religion is bad too, but isn’t there something in between these polar opposites? Something like; “Freedom of religion, but you can’t just invent a bunch of phony, contrived nonsense and exploit gullible people, ok?”

20090205150901AAHQR6U	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	How does my 3 year old know what a ghost is?	Last night, my son (almost 3), was in his room playing, like he normally does. He came out into the living room & said, "Mom. There's a ghost in my room. Don't look." He has never said anything about a ghost before. (We moved to our house when he was 5 months old.)   I usually can feel a pressence & tell when one is around, but I have never felt anything in this house. I have also seen a spirit before (turns out it was my great grandma).  Anyway, I asked my son if the ghost was a boy or a girl. He didn't say anything. Then I asked if it was nice. He shook his head no. "Mean?!" I asked. He said, "No mom. It's in my room. I closed the door. Don't go in there!" I went to ask more questions (not trying to scare him), but he said, "Just STOP talking!" Like he wanted to forget all about it.  How does he know what a 'ghost' is?   If there was any show/movie we've watched, a 'ghost' would've probably just looked like a normal person. Maybe a bit transparent. I've never mentioned a 'ghost' to him. The only time would've been at Halloween...My aunty said Scooby-Doo chases ghosts all the time. But he doesn't watch scooby- doo...  I know children can see spirits. But if he really did see one, wouldn't it  just look like a person to him...not a 'ghost'?  This afternoon he was in his room again, playing. He was having quite the conversation with 'someone'. And playing very nicely. He would say, "Okay. Your turn." He was playing cars & asked 'someone' if they wanted a hotdog. I asked if I could have a hotdog, too. He said no & just shut down. I appologized for interupting him, but was curious of his attitude afterwards...  Sorry this is so long, but do you think there was a 'ghost' or is his imagination getting the best of him?  P.S. I know children will have imaginary friends to replace someone. We recently had a baby & maybe he's just missing our time together?  Feedback, please. LOL

20061214235923AAQvcdd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why be called an atheist at all?	An atheist is just that... not a theist. Not a believer in the supernatural (e.g., gods).      Well, are people who don't believe in fairies called a-fairyists? What about people who don't believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Are they called a-FSMsts? So why should people who don't believe in gods be called a-theists?      Besides for statistical purposes.. is there really a reason?      And anyway, we're ALL atheists to some things. Atheists to Aphrodite, Thor, Quetzlcoatl, unicorns, trolls, etc.
20090205143602AA22hvb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I was bored, so I came up with something wierd...?	Christianity talks about how Jesus is a Savior. What I'm (kind of) thinking is that a zombie apocalypse broke out a long time ago and by consuming the flesh of Jesus, the zombies reverted back to normal people, thus the "blood and flesh" and the "becoming like Christ" aspect of the Christian faith. Another bit of evidence is the passage that states that the End Times will have people "rising from their graves" and that we will "make war on each other" (Compare that to "make war on other countries".). Also, the end of the Revelation specifically states that "unclean" (infected) people will not be allowed into the kingdom of Heaven (the safe zone). Mix that with the common Christian belief that sin is carried through our blood. I know it sounds crazy, but maybe there's something that the ancients were trying to warn us about. Laugh all you want, but I'm keeping a watchful eye on what's happening in this world. Do you like my theory?

20070101174946AAbcany	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Maybe you can offer some insight on this matter?	I am gay but I have long thought that homosexuality is wrong because it is sex just for the physical and emotional feeling... that the physical nature of it is base and that emotional companionship is available via safer, more virtuous (I'm Catholic, too, by the way) means.       However, I have a hard time seeing why God would even care if I love a woman and want to marry her. I mean, He made me this way, so I don't see why it should really be a problem so long as I am chaste and exhibit virtue and love for Him and all His creation.      The thing that hurts and really bothers me is that although I'm celibate, if I were to enter into a relationship, it would cut me off from the Most Holy Sacraments, which I love dearly and I find tremendously important. I do not see why, if I have a girlfriend and am indeed much more chaste than my straight friends, I am a mortal sinner and cannot recieve the Blessed Sacraments. What has companionship with a lovely lady to do with the Eucharist?

I proved by KNOWLEDGE of the greek of the new testament that hades can never be "grave" and so nor sheol can be once it's the equivalent for the gree hades. I showed 5 basic differences between hades and menemeiou (menemeiou = grave) and inclusively I showed verses that they could check it. One JW's accused me of being misrepresenting, but she argued with translations versions took from the biblegateway.com   How can it be?

20090205142006AAXReKj	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Why are men expected to give gifts and women expected to give sex on Valentine's Day?	I have heard so many females gripe about their husband/boyfriend not getting them anything for Valentine's Day... or getting them the wrong thing. To be honest, I'm sick to death of it. Some girls (most of them are the younger more immature crowd) will get irate when they find out that their boyfriend isn't planning anything special and threaten to dump the guy. When girls ask questions on here about whether they should be mad that their guy isn't planning anything, most females support them and advise them to dump the guy because he _obviously_ doesn't love her. Why is this? Are we, as a culture, raising young women to be greedy, materialistic, self centered creatures?       Also, why is it when women ask for ideas on what to give their men for this day, the only advice they really get is of a sexual nature? C'mon! Isn't there anything more original than sex? For goodness sake, you can do that any time, why does the fact that it's done on one particular day make it any better than it otherwise would be?       (okay, so I'm ranting...)
20090205143513AA8t30x	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	My theory on poltergeists, like to know if you might agree with me?	So it is my belief that if someone is to die and choose not to 'cross over' or 'move on' to the real after life, then they automatically become demons (or as we know, Poltergeists) and that the REAL Hell is when you refuse to accept you are dead so you remain on Earth and must watch the living go on with their lives while you mold into a demonic looking figure and you become spiteful of the living, thus tormenting the living, thus becoming what most of us know as 'ghosts' or 'poltergeists'.       Well that's how I think it all works, and I actually explained this to a few ghost-loving friends of mine, and they disagreed with me completely, but I thought it was a reasonable idea. What do you think?

But is this really true? Also, how about those children who have no family, no one to care for them...no one to teach them morals. Is religion then the only thing that can keep them in a good place (i.e. not getting involved with drugs, gangs, etc.)  Religion works through fear . . . keeps people in line and doing the "right thing" by scaring the hell out of them. Is this the only way that children will do the right thing? If so, is religion then always necessary in a society? at least when people are still growing up with no one to teach them morals?

I am doing a project for school where I need to make an artifact that has to do with an ancient civilization.       I really love learning about the Greek gods and mythology but I am stuck in what kind of artifact I could make!       Remember I have to make this so a statue of one of the gods is not a great idea!      So basically any suggestion of an artifact that I could make, that has to do with Greek mythology or Greek Gods!      *Thanks*

20061102150151AAF0kNT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does truth really matter???	Truth what is it and how do I know it?????Many people claim they know the truth but what is it.first of all I may be old fashioned but I believe in abolsutes. Many people try to make truth and bend truth to fit their personal lifestyle.Why is there so many churches.Because truth isn't absolute.But I do believe that their is a true church the teachs the unadulterated Word of God and teachs truth. People love going to a church that doesn't teach against anything.People love going to a church that doesn't make them feel guilty about themselves. But I wonder what would happen if Jesus walked into the churches this day and what He would say.Let me give an example........don't take my word for it....baptism...Jesus said to the Disciples to baptize in the NAME of the FATHER,and of the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST. What was the name???? The name is Jesus. The Father ,Son,and Holy Ghost was just titles.Peter in Acts chapter 2:38 told the people to baptize in the NAME of Jesus.Does truth matter ??

Inside I secretly feel that people aren't worth the bother. I know I should take the time to discriminate between good and bad people but there is good and there is bad in everybody. It's the people who have made derogatory comments about me that really get to me.      Anyway, I am tired of being shy, i have been diagnosed with social anxiety because I get so nervous around people but if I just changed my mindset and made some effort this would go away. I actively avoid people when I can't be bothered (happens quite often). But anyways, how are you interesting and how can I achieve this?

Last night I was getting money from a cash machine and as I was counting it some nutjob shouted at me "give me all your money!" and touched the notes. I thought it was a joke, maybe someone i knew, but it wasn't. This horrible looking dude, drunk off his head. He said "Oi maaate, can i've a fiver for a taxi lieeek?" (5) and I pondered it for a minute. Five quid to get him out of my face. Bargain! But I didn't have change. HE STALKED ME EVERYWHERE I WENT FOR 5 MINUTES! Then when I finally got change he said "Oi are you bisexual?" o.0 "I'm sorry... what was that?" he said... "Can I suck your dick?" So I said "no definately not" and ran on a bit. I don't know what he said when he was walking off and I don't know why i think he said it, or why it bothers me, but it gets to me when i think he said "no sweat you're ugly anyway". But I can't be sure i heard this, maybe it's just insecurity? But for other guys out there, at what point would you have hit him?

I understand that when talking to someone, from time to time a person will look away. But do you think that a person's complete failure to maintain eye contact means they are lying? Let's say you ask, "Have I done anything to offend you?" The person you're asking replies, "No" but says it while looking at the wall, floor, or someone else. Would you consider that there may be some dishonesty there? I'm asking because I'm big on reading body language. Perhaps I shouldn't be. Please...no rude or sarcastic answers and please don't direct your answers at me. I want to know what you think. Thanks.

THey seem to mess up	our lives so bad and we are the ones who should forgive, who should forget, who should let it go......the effort seems to be only in our hands because they seem to damage our lives so bad. I truly hope God sees all this and that, at the end, He gives us a reward for all that we had to bear and to grow. I know the benefits are ours, not theirs, but it is hard to forgive unforgivable people sometimes, it is hard to let go of things that shattered our lives and broke our hearts so bad. I am a Christian and I know I have been thru a huge test and that I must forgive some of the people who hurt me the most in my life. And yet, I don't have a family I can rely on because they don't believe me. So, sometimes I feel I am between the rock and the hard wall. How would you cope with this?

This year while her birthday is fast approaching we planned to cut the cake a little differently. i suggested her to cut it in her birthday suit itself for a change and she agreed for a thrill. we decided to not to invite others except for those closest friends who joined us at the nude beach. She feels that as they have seen her before in this way, she wouldnt mind cutting the cake in this fashion.(we planned not to tell them in advance but to surprise them on that day).Hopw would those friends react to this? Can we proceed? any more improvements or suggestions?

20070106112936AA9VlKa	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Do yo believe in Atlantis?	Many people have negated the existance of Atalantis because no body ever found it, except in Near Bermuda they found some ruins near an Islan but said that it was mearly part of a preMinean civilization. The only reference to Atlantis is Plato (or was it Socrates?). In the ancient Greek script it speaks of Atlantis, a civilization much more advanced than or current one with amazing crystal technology.  They sunk themselfs with a huge blast from a giant crystal. Do you believe or know anymore bout Atlantis, or are you a pessimest that has been fooled by the scientists?????

We had an assignment to do where we were supposed to calculate how long years were millions of years ago, based on some model that scientists made up. I refused to do it, because I know that God's word says that the world is only 6,000 years old. The professor told me that if I refused to do the assignment that I would fail it. This is not fair. From every angle it seems like we are being attacked by evolutionist garbage. I really feel so persecuted. What can I do?
20090205143535AALT8pX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is mankind good or bad by nature?	There are some who would say that man is inherently good, but can easily be distracted from inherent goodness by evil.      This is, I suppose, supported in the Genesis 3 account - God made man and woman in His image (good), but they were tempted and succumbed to temptation towards evil.      Others say that man is inherently bad, or evil, having somehow lost that God-image.  Therefore any good that a person can do is also stained by bad.      In scenario one, mankind does not need a savior, but only to return to the original image.   In scenario two, mankind is desperately in need of someone to rescue him from himself and destruction.      What do you think?

I was admentally against evolution before and when I dealt with the facts I didn't run away to my bible and block out intellectual honesty.      I don't mean to be cruel to some of you creationists who honestly don't buy into it, but you should take responsibility for knowing the evidence for evolution just as you do that the earth is round.

20090205150831AApkstX	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Help us understand something we may not see?	I'm not sure where to start. My name is Angela and I'm 22 years old. I was with my girlfriend Jodie for almost 4 years...we were so much in love. We moved in together after 4 months. On July 25th 2008 we had a misunderstanding over the phone which led to an actual break up...she moved out.. i begged and pleaded. I thought my life was over because i loved her so much. My birthday on the 29 th led to my finding out that she was actually in a relationship with a guy she works with which was actually a mutual friend. The first month they were together she was already sleeping with me again and telling me how big of a mistake she made. We had actually met up once or twice for lunch to talk about getting back together and taking things slowly this time because she couldn't imagine not having me in her life. Especially once i told her that being friends is absolutely unacceptable considering the mutual attraction towards each other and the history behind us. She agreed that there's no way we could be friends. She tells me that she just fell out of love with me and that's why everything happened. I know for a fact that love is definitely possible again. It's now been 6 months, and we still talk. This last week actually we spent together having fun with each other confessing our love for one another again. She was trying to figure out a way to break up with her boyfriend so we could start over because she loves me. Then something stops her from taking the final step to making a commitment with me again. She can't figure out what it is stopping her. She feels like she' going crazy because we talk about it for days laying in bed with one another and then hit that wall again... Do you think she fell out of love with me? Could she still be in love with me, and not accept that or be in denial about it because she has convinced herself that that's why we fell through? Or could the crush she had on this guy and my fucked up life just reciprocate each other and cause havoc that we think cannot be resolved. I know its hard for someone to verbally promise that they're a changed person like i have, but I honestly have a clear minded observation about myself that i have changed as a person bc of this situation but i know easier said than done...but without a chance who will ever know? i  just dont know anymore but I would lay down in death for her. She tells me that everything reminds her of me, when she kisses him she wishes it were me and she sits at her window hoping i will just drive by. She just doesn't know what's keeping her from taking that final step. I want to make the best life for both of us...PLEASE HELP!

20090205151240AAUAYWw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the Teaching of Religion Really a Form of Child Abuse?	In The God Delusion and other writings, Richard Dawkins claims that teaching children about religion (specifically, the doctrine of hell) is a form of child abuse that scars children for life. Accordingly, Dawkins states, "Priestly groping of child bodies is disgusting. But it may be less harmful in the long run than priestly subversion of child minds." Conspicuously absent in his writings are any published studies documenting that teaching children religious principles might adversely affect them. Since Dawkins claims to always rely upon science as the basis for his beliefs, why didn't he cite any science in support of his claims?      Child abuse is a serious charge, and the physical abuse of children impacts their lives adversely in many different ways. Published studies show that physical abuse negatively impacts their mental health, providing additional risks for psychopathology, increased suicidal behaviors, eating disorders, depression, delinquency and criminal behaviors, and alcohol abuse. Impairment cause by child abuse produces life-long consequences for the individual and for society as a whole, which must deal with these unfortunate people.      In one of the largest studies of its kind, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examined the role of religion in the lives of nearly 2500 adolescents. The adolescents indicated the level of their indoctrination (i.e., frequency of church attendance) and importance of religion, along with a number of activities that they have or have not participated in. Listed below are graphs of behaviors that would generally be considered to be unfavorable. To see larger versions of the graphs, just hover your cursor over the thumbnail image;      (Here is the site with the thumbnails)       http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics...       These data show that religiously indoctrinated youth are much less involved with illegal substances, alcohol abuse, criminal and violent activities, and have fewer problems in school. Dawkins's hypothesis that religious indoctrination is bad for children has been soundly falsified. In fact, those who never attend church or feel that religion is not important display far more symptoms of real child abuse than those who are subject to frequent religious indoctrination.      Within the last few years there have been numerous reports of child molestation committed by clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. The complaints have been so numerous that many people assume that religious people commit child abuse at a higher rate than the population at large. When I was growing up there were numerous newspaper articles about molestations within the Boy Scouts. Let's face it, if you want to molest boys, what better place to go? However, the Boy Scouts changed their policies so that adult leaders are never allowed to be alone with the boys. Leadership in the Boy Scouts must always be at least two deep. Since they instituted that policy, there have been almost no cases of molestation. Did being a Boy Scout leader cause one to want to molest boys? Or was it just a good venue for getting access? The Roman Catholic Church hasn't quite figured it out yet. If they instituted the two deep leadership policy for all adult/child interactions, their problem would almost completely disappear, as well. Molesters will go where their targets are easily accessible - it has nothing to do with religion. I used to be an atheist. Now that I am a Christian, I don't suddenly feel drawn to molest boys!       Richard Dawkins's hypothesis that religious teaching of children is a form of child abuse is shown to be scientifically unsupported. In fact, the scientific data shows that exactly the opposite - that adolescents who receive frequent religious instruction behave more appropriately and are better adjusted to adult life in society compared to their non-religious peers. Richard Dawkins's own writings indicate that he himself was the victim of sexual abuse from a priest. Of course he would be angry at the religious authority who abused his power for evil purposes. Maybe this is why Dawkins is so adamant in his opposition to religious belief. However, making up the obviously failed hypothesis that religious instruction amounts to child abuse is not going to convince any except the extremely naive. Scientific data shows that teaching children the moral principles of religion has a positive impact on their behavior, as would be expected intuitively.      What do you think?

My Mum, Grandmother and sister were getting on a bus to drive into the city (this is in Bangladesh btw, they were going to the airport to come to the UK). When my sister was little she would always recite 'Lailaha illalah.' While they were getting on the bus, my sister stopped my Mum and told her not to get on, she was saying that the bus is going to crash, obviously no one listened to her, my sister was like 5 years old.       So they got onto the bus, my sister was just reciting as usual like a kid sings nursery rhymes, and all of a sudden the bus crashes. There was mayhem, no one was hurt, just a few minor hospital injuries and this guy took my sister and thanked her and said that because she recited 'Lailaha illalah' lives were saved.      This is true, even though it sounds like a fairy tale.      And for me personally, I achieved something which I know I couldn't have done without God, I'm thankful for it everyday.

Amen.       26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.       28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."

20090205153327AAr7wir	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is your favorite Beatitude?	NLT              Mat 5:1 One day as the crowds were gathering, Jesus went up the mountainside with his disciples and sat down to teach them.            Mat 5:2 This is what he taught them:            Mat 5:3 "God blesses those who realize their need for him, [fn] for the Kingdom of Heaven is given to them.            Mat 5:4 God blesses those who mourn, for they will be comforted.            Mat 5:5 God blesses those who are gentle and lowly, for the whole earth will belong to them.            Mat 5:6 God blesses those who are hungry and thirsty for justice, for they will receive it in full.            Mat 5:7 God blesses those who are merciful, for they will be shown mercy.            Mat 5:8 God blesses those whose hearts are pure, for they will see God.            Mat 5:9 God blesses those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God.            Mat 5:10 God blesses those who are persecuted because they live for God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.            Mat 5:11 "God blesses you when you are mocked and persecuted and lied about because you are my followers.            Mat 5:12 Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted, too.

20090205154418AAbWfOq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Please, explain what on Earth would compel someone to do this.?	Right. So I have no issue with religious people, I really don't. In fact my parents are both very religious people. However, this, I do not understand. This afternoon I was walking to my car from work. I woke up felt terrible, I slept terribly last night and looked like I felt: awful. I had food splatters all over my shirt and was obviously tired and frustrated (hence my angry rant on the way to my car in about 3 different languages). It was OBVIOUS I was tired, in a bad mood and on my way home. So, why on earth did some girl decide to STOP ME on the way to my car to discuss my knowledge of the freaking bible! I totally don't understand what on Earth made her think that approaching me in that state would help sway me to whatever her cause was. Seriously! Who does that and WHY? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

20090205151515AAK1Bw5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians- Can you answer this question?	Lots of Christians say that they don't try to push their beliefs on people, but I beg to differ. Whenever somebody mentions to them that God isn't real, they either get upset and try to shove their beliefs down your throat or, they'll quote a passage from the Bible or more specifically, the few books of the Bible that HAVEN"T been left out. If the Bible is the be all end all instruction manual of eternal Salvation, then why do the MANY diferent Christian religious institutions ARGUE over the same book? In fact, I bet that you can't answer these questions WITHOUT being rude, getting upset, or quoting a biblical passage, or, simply, saying some Bible oriented thing that your cult has told you. I'm terribly sorry if I have hurt your feelings, but Christianity is a plague that must be dealt with. I'm not saying that we can't have love for one another. I'm just saying that we need to wake up to reality. I hope you understand.    P.S.- I used to believe in God. I'm happy to have made it out.

A gay male (GM) and straight male (SM) are both living in the same house for more than a year.       GM is dicreet, dominant and high achiever and is older by about 5 years. SM is 22, very handsome, and works in one of GM's business associates company, upon GM's recommendation.       Things turn in different way when SM refuses to be affectionate to GM. GM feels sad and asks for more affection like touching while i bed. Both sleep in the same bed. SM gaps himself from GM saying he is taken advantaged off by GM. But GM does not think so. GM is just affectionate and all affections are done privately.       But why SM thinks that GM is taking advantage of him? Why does he refuse to give GM affections?       SM mentioned of a "neutral relationship". What does it mean if applied in this specific case?       GM helps SM sincerely, in fact the GM offers SM a place to stay without any payment, while working overseas. They do have sex because there was an agreement on this matter.

I work with a fellow who spends all day belching, passing gas, clearing his throat, humming, and whistling.  I've politely pointed out to him that it is distracting, and that co-workers and customers alike find it to be rude.      He says, "I am not aware that I am doing it," or he just smiles and shrugs and keeps on doing it.        I suppose it could be justified if he had Tourette's or some sort of other disorder, but the reality is that he has no actual condition.  He just chooses to be that way, and sees no reason to change.      Why are there so many people like that, who have the attitude of "I'll do what I like, and too bad if you don't care for it."?

So, the classic response from an atheist addressing a Christian who is spreading his beliefs is: "Back off. Everyone has the right to believe what they want."      So my question to you is: What exactly *is* this "right" that everyone has? Where does it stem from? Does it stem from everyone's right to existence? If so, do we *truly* even have a 'right' to exist? Why would you say so?      Those are some questions that have been crossing my mind lately, and I'd appreciate your guys' thoughts on the matter. My mind gets all jumbled up when I think about it, and it would be helpful to get some input from people who have probably thought about it more then me, and have more knowledge then me.       Thanks for your time!      ~Side note~      I'll be checking back daily, so feel free to answer whenever, and take as much time as needed. Your answer will get read.

As if I need to get out and run awa from life... Society. I've ALWAYS been a people person. But now I have no desire whatsoever to befriend anyone. I scowl, hiss and give the death state to people I don't even know. I don't mean to, I'm even suprised I do it because it just happens. I feel like I want them to die, but I don't know them. Nothing hurts me. Nothing! I try scratching, biting, pinching myself but it doesn't hurt. I bit myself so hard once it became a bruise but it didn't even hurt a little. (I'm not pyscho I promsie you. I was just experimenting) I'm always cold. Either I'm in the shower, the heater is on, or I'm covered in blankets or a jacket I'm ALWAYS cold. My skin is freezing to the touch. I can sort of make out a whisper from across the room but not so much but I can hear plain as day my mother talking when she's across the house and my television and music are blaring. My eye color is never consistent either. Sometimes it's blue, green, hazel, or gray. Once someone even said that they were brown. They get extremley light sometimes and at other times they are dark. It's... Wierd. I've always been slightly clumsy but not I'm well-balanced and even graceful you could say. If you have any questions or answers, please feel free to ask/tell. I would really appreciate it. Thanks.

20090205150204AAGvuWH	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What are some reason why cellphones should be allowed in school?	i'm doing i report in myaccess.com   i have a 5.8/6    but i want a 6/6    this is what i have so far      Dear, Principle                 Many schools restrict students from using their cell phones during school hours. Teachers and administrators have concerns that students will use their cellphone dishonestly or inappropriately. Adults in the education system, say cellphones at school are a very big problem to the education of students. Many teachers, principles and vise principles say that they are a very big distraction in the education of students. This can be true. However, cellphones in schools have many positives to them as well.                     The problem arises when the cell phones are brought to school. Many school districts prohibit their use, even their presence at all times, even during prep periods and lunch. Student handbooks outlaw the possession of a cell phone anywhere on school grounds. Any child with a cell phone can have it confiscated by faculty. I disagree with this policy. And while I am well aware that many students will use their phones indiscriminately, trying to call or text friends during class or risk having their phones go off in the classroom, I can't agree with the policy of no cell phones. It isn't practical.                     Cellphones can be used for many things. Cellphones can be a very big help in the education system as well. This is so, because most cellphones have Internet connection. Students can use their cellphones to access their Internet connection, instead of buying very expensive laptops or computers. This can save many money of the schools budget, which will be a great progress to the school district.                    There are many other ways that cellphones can do good during school. There are many accidents during school hours. It can be a very big dramatic problem, if they have something to do with your parents or any of your relatives. How are the parents or relatives supposed to communicate with that child if they don't have a cellphone with them? Only 12 percent of parents have the number of the school district, according to Education Magazine.                    Mobile phones are a safety feature in a world that has become unsafe and unfriendly especially to children. How many adults feel safer knowing they have a cell phone in their possession, not simply for talking to friends, but just in case. I know I do and have used it more than once to summon help. How much more necessary is for your child to have one on their person just in case?                        Nevertheless, some school boards have decided that cell phones do more harm than good. School officials say that along with causing distractions in an educational environment, cell phones have also been used in illicit acts such as drug dealing and making bomb threats. Still, why should thousands have to pay the price for the illegal actions of a few? If a phone rings during class, the teacher has every right to confiscate it, but to forbid the very presence of cell phones is ridiculous. Banning cell phones doesn't even solve these problems; it just reroutes them to a place outside of the school's jurisdiction.                    We are living in unpredictable times. The horrors of Sept. 11 and the Columbine school massacre ought to show us that we are highly susceptible to danger, even during the school day. cell phones should be allowed in school in case of emergencies.Teenagers are getting more independent as they get older, and often the only way that their parents can be immediately assured of their where abouts and safety is by calling us. Some emergenices would include fires, shottings,and tornadoes. If there was a fire the students could call the fire departmentif the teacher wasn't able to reach the phone. The horrors of Sept. 11 and theColumbine school massacre should show us that we are highly exposed todanger, even during the school day. The only way that we can have the slightest peace of mind is by knowing that our loved ones are just a call away, and no school board should take that away from us.                    Here's a different reason for cellphones to be able to be used in school. Threats. Threats, are very dangerous, you never know if it is a prank or a real threat. Why would you take a chance? What if there was a fire and the school burns down? That would mean the school's phones would not be available. As you saw so far students should have their cellphones with them at all times. It's a fast and easy way to communicate with parents or relatives. You never know, that is why children in school should have cellphones with them.                    So as you see, cellphones are a very important part of the education and safety system. As you also read cellphones are good for learning. Cellphones are good for safety in case of any emergency. What are you waiting for? Help us be able to use cellphones. It will save money for school, help us learn, and be protected!

20070129041654AANHsYF	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Does anyone recall what AIDS was called before it was called AIDS?	This is a question for either medical professionals or the older amongst us in the GLBT community.  I do not believe anyone younger than 40 is going to know.      In the 80's before the disease HIV was known, there was a term for the symptoms that we know all too well.      Carposi Sarcoma was amongst the most common symptom remarked upon in it.      It was considered, at that time, to be a solely Gay disease and this term reflected it.  This term would have been from the middle 80's.  I know HIV and AIDS was used in the late 80's.      I remember something called ARDS being associated with it but that was not the term.

As of all the prophecies in the Bible like Israel rebecoming a nation just like it was during Biblical times, other prophecies concerning nations and lands, etc; such an event of that magnitude that has impacted the world to this day must and should be prophesied in some way or another in the Bible.  So what Bible reference does it explicitly mentions or at least hints about the discovery and colonization of the Americas and not just of the Americas, but of Australia and New Zealand, whose histories are similar to that of the Americas?  Also, do you think God allowed this to happen to punish the native peoples of their wickedness and idols like God did in Biblical times to the Amorites, Amalekites, Canaanites, and even to the Israelites themselves?

A very famous cell biologist, who wrote one of the most widely used biology textbooks, is currently battling GA creationists who want a disclaimer on every textbook stating that evolution is not fact.        http://www.telegram.com/article/20090205...       This biologist insists that there can be a happy mix between belief in religious dieties, and evolutionary theory.      What surprises me is this uproar at the idea of including evolution in a scientific text used by school children....what is the problem? Whether part of the educational curriculum or not, kids will learn about evolution through exposure to society. Whether part of the educational curriculum or not, kids will discover a variance among religious belief.       Is it not better to expose them to everything and allow them to decide for themselves and draw their own conclusions, rather than leave them half informed?       What is it that causes the debate to rage on? Do Christians fear their children moving toward the freethinkers? Would you love and accept your children any less if they decided they believed in evolutionary theory?

20090205105009AAAc0hg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is voting against homosexual marriage a sin?	The only reason one would have for wanting to outlaw homosexual marriage is a religious one. Therefore, by outlawing it, you are using your religion to make laws, which is against the 1st Amendment.      Since the Bible says to obey the laws of the land,including the 1st Amendment, supporting a ban on same-sex marriage which is unconstitutional and therefore illegal is violating the laws of the land, thus going against the Bible, thus sinning.      So, if you supported a ban on gay marriage, have you confessed your sin?

I was happily skipping around, answering questions in my merry way, and then I noticed to my surprise that thirty seconds after I posted an answer, I'd get a thumbsdown - regardless of whether my answer was stupid, useful, funny or sarcastic! Even if it was so exquisitely wonderful that it received many thumbsups and won BA, I'd still get at least one thumbsdown, always just seconds after I posted.      So I consulted the Y!A Necronomicon, and found I was being haunted by a Thumb Demon. This is a smelly creature with no life and laughably small genitalia, who follows its victim around, sniggering as it stabs the down button and dreams of the pain it thinks it's causing. Ironic, really, given that I've just made Level 7 and am up there with Fireball, even.       So straightway I cast a healing spell of Invisibility on my Q&A. And the thumbsdowns stopped! Foiled and angry, the demon slunk off into the gloom to pop its pustules. My Kung Fu is indeed great!

I sit and simmer in resentfulness of the bliss of ignorance and wish it were me!!! I just want to go back to having a good laugh with friends without all the guilt and sorrow I feel afterwards! I don't have the Spirit anymore, so I try to fill it with other things, and I find no help either way. What can I do? :( I DON"T want to stop being a Christian, but I can't take it anymore!!! I feel like I'm a hopeless case!

I had never heard of them until a few months ago when a colleague of mine was forced to attend one.  I heard the phrase "Come to Jesus meeting" in passing.        My question is this:  How can any company with 300+ employees impose such meetings on it's employees?  What if a staff person does NOT believe in Jesus?   Without stating my religious beliefs here, I am personally offended by such meetings even though I have never attended one.   Not everyone believes in Jesus....!?!?   Why can't they come up with a new name for it???

20090205134127AAAsViM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For Bible Scholars. Hebrews 4(KJV)? Why three different types of rest mentioned when looking at the Greek?	Three different types of rest are mentioned in Hebrews 4;   when looking at the Greek for rest in the KJV version of Heb 4:   3. Sabbatismos (rest): Heb 4:9...a rest remaining to the ppl of God   2. Katapausis (rest): Heb 4:1,3,5,10,11...us labor to enter, to not fall   1. Katapauo (rest): Heb 4:4,8...a 7th day rest Jesus did not give them      Is it somehow connected with three things mentioned in Heb 4:12   3. 3rdly rectifying the heart of the matter: plural thoughts and intents   2. 2ndly dividing asunder joints(laws) marrow(grace) as in 2Tim2:15   1. 1stly dividing asunder soul(Adam1) spirit(Adam2) as in 1Cor15:45      Dividing soul spirit could be allegory dividing Rom 8:2 law law,   by divide Adam1 Adam2, and problem being in Adam(law) all die.      Dividing joints 13 admonishes us to go on unto perfection in order   to get the heart established with grace only, not both grace and law,   and thereby not both rise to grace and fall from grace to law(Gal 5:4).      Rightly dividing the word of truth clarity, in 2Tim 2:15,    should end being both approved (only) and unashamed,   speaks of having the heart established with grace only;   For if grace + law then it's both approved + disapproved,   which seems to end up in a hall of shame like Hebrews 11,   (these all "died" and "received not the promise" = Ooops)   which concludes God hath provided some better thing for us.      Comments welcome.

Me and my so-called "friends" were walking home from school when we started talking about God and origin. I told them I didnt believe in God and that we arrived here via abiogenesis, then evolution (I was just stating my opinion, I wasnt trying to convert them). Well, my friend Sean didnt take too kindly to that, and started a fight with me. I punched him in the head after he pushed me, but then everyone else took his side and started to attack me. They kept hitting me with a perfectly selected stick (you know, the pointy ones?), and I started crying - it was horrible. All of them come from wealthy theistic families (I have reason to believe they were Amish.), and don't believe in my religion of non-religion. They called me a troll and beat me with my science text book, then they called me a monkey and pulled on my hair, I went home and told my parents what had happened, my mom got scared and said "you're moving with your aunti and uncle in Bel-Air"      Later at home that same day, I was reading comics and everything became grey, I couldnt even see what I was trying to read, I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed, my mother started screaming "What are you, on drugs!? Look at you, you're getting blood all over my rug!" She beat me over the head with a remote control and opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull, I picked it up and screamed "LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE YOU DONE!", she said: "OH my God! I'm sorry son!" I said **** it, grabbed it and put it back up in my head, got a couple of screws and put bolts in my neck.      Did I do the right thing?

(While I dont agree with that assessment, here is my question:)       Why doesnt the religious right simply "shut up and deal with" the fact that abortion is legal in this country?      If the majority voted to make a law saying that religious folks could not (insert whatever action you wish here), would religious people be okay with being told that they should just "shut up and deal with it?"

20090205130057AAWiA1Q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In your religion, do you think of yourself as a 'god'; I mean a 'judge' of the intentions of others hearts?	I know that in Mormonism, the man does works towards exaltation's to become a god. Is that really to become a 'judge' of other people's hearts?   Since they say they attain exaltation's through works. So they then judge others who don't do the works they do. But so do other works religions.      2. Isn't there already plenty of other 'gods'?      Since the bible does say that the LORD God is God above all gods.  So there are other gods.      There is One LORD God or Echad (United) Yahweh Elohim (plural of Elh).      But the LORD is God (Elohim) over all gods (elohim).      The LORD God is One Creator God. Or the Yahweh Elohim is One Creator God.      While there are plenty of other 'gods' already. The Angels (winged Cherubims) are Sons of God (Elohim) in the bible. But they can be considered gods also.  While the devil is a god of this age & who rules in disobedient children. And worldly wisdom is a god of this age (worldly wisdom is a wisdom where peoples hearts are still separate from the heart of God).      And then human righteous judges were called gods. And also self righteous people who judge other people critically & condemn them make themself gods.

20090205130150AAlkN5m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, why do you insist your beliefs are based on blind faith?	..when God offers ample evidence for his existence, and nowhere command us to believe in spite of the evidence to the contrary?      A blind faith will surely lead to instability.  I have questioned my faith since day one, and have searched and found answers.  But you don't even need the Bible to know God exists, otherwise the Bible itself would not say:   Rom 1:20  For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,    Rom 1:21  because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.       We know from personal experience that intelligible results do not just happen from explosions.  We have caused explosions (note that these explosions have an intelligent cause, US, while big bang cosmology offers an explosion without a cause), and we have also designed and created things.  Observation leads us to the conclusion that design and creation produces order and that explosions produce chaos, unless directed by intelligence.      We see God's triune nature in all of creation through Atoms being comprised of protons, neutrons, and electrons; and the universe consisting of space, time and matter.   Objects all have length, width and depth.  Three dimensions, three persons of the Godhead.      We can see the veracity of God's word in that it exists intact after centuries, where other literary works have not been able to, prior to the printing press.      We have so much evidence that we should be presenting it, not hiding from it.  It is not "science versus religion", it is "religion versus religion" because natural cosmology and evolution are PRESUMPTIONS made from the evidence, not direct observation of the evidence, and creationism brings presumptions and interprets the evidence adequately in a different way.      Our "trump card" should be logic itself, not pitting logic against faith!  Faith IS LOGICAL!  A universe governed by randomness (lack of any intelligent origin) and lawlessness is totally illogical in the face of the intelligibility of the universe!

He stirred controvery in 1987, when he told TIME that his son had seen him raise a child from the dead.    Roberts' eldest son, Ronald, committed suicide in June 1982 at the age of 37 after getting a court order to get counseling at a drug treatment center in February.    This is what he did  ***In 1987, during a fund raising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would "call him home" (a euphemism for death).***    Some were fearful that he was referring to suicide given the passionate pleas and tear that accompanied his statement.    From the late 1980's to 1992 Roberts maintained a residence in the exclusive St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton, Florida. Roberts would commute via private jet from his base in Oklahoma to Boca Raton airport for weekend visits to his golf club retreat.

20070327065110AAGStGK	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Starting a GSA and reducing homophobic comments?	I attend a Catholic high school. One of the students tried to start a GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance). Our counselors and chaplain (in-school priest) approved. However, when they spoke to our principal, he rejected. He has a history of being homophobic in his comments and actions. He openly rejected the proposed group, as he claimed that the Catholic church would not allow such a sin. I think that the church's viewpoint is wrong. Is there action that I could take to make a stand?      I would also like to reduce the number of homophobic comments. Every day, I hear people calling this girl a 'f*g' and a 'd*ke'. I have confronted the administration about this, and they have not done a thing. This poor kid is being tormented daily, and nothing happens to end it. I have stood up for her, and gotten ridiculed myself.      By the way, I cannot send anything to the newspaper stating my stance. Immediately after this instance, the school added a clause that nobody may send a letter to the newspaper.

20090205135909AAxgJHk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Unmaking Jehovah's witnesses bad interpretations... JW's leaders have no skills at the original the bible.?	My question is below the comment.      Jehovah's witnesses say: "Sheol and hades are the common entombment of humanity".       Unmaking the bad interpretation:   The greek word for entombment is "menmeiou" (John 11:17; John 12:17 - "the greek new testament" and "textus receptus"). It's not "hades" as they say. Likewise, the hebrew word for entombment is "queber", not sheol. The equivalent greek word for sheol is hades, so let's check the differences...      QUEBER    Used in plural   There are many "quebers"   It shelter or receives or cadaver   There's one for each person      SHEOL   Used in the singular for (Job 17:15-16)   There's only one sheol   Doesn't never shelter cadavers or bodies   Place where there are many people   Only God sends people to sheol or hades (Luke 16:22-23)      The question: Don't the commnission of translation of the government body know about that?
20090205114153AAA3TFs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can someone explain this dream to me?	We were nomads travelling from place to place on a journey trying to get somewhere and during our trip we had to jump through different hoops and accomplish different things to survive. On the last journey it was raining outside and we had to find shelter from the storm in circulur formations of rock... that were hollow on the inside. There was a hole outside the rock where rain was leaking through teh celing and I had to steal blankets from other people in order to keep warm. I went to a rich girl's house, and stole a plastic snake (that was large) a large handerkerchief, and a couple of miscellaneous items that I thought she wouldn't need. Then I left feeling safe. Sometime later, she paid me a visit, and I was very scared that she would discover that I stole her things, I tried to concel the things that I stole through my legs.. but the gap between them was too big and it was painfully obvious to everyone that I had stolen her things. I thought since it was a dream, I could use my will and my emotions to change the shape of the supernatural realm... so that she never discovers that I stole her things and I suceeded for a while. Then she left... It was as if she discovered that I stole her things, and then forgot what happened as soon as she walked out of the picture.       Background: I wanted to write a book on chrisitan theology and I asked an african man who was doing a masters in theology at a university in germany to give me some ideas for my book that i could build on, expand, elaborate and research. He said he would get back to me today... and today no e-mail.

Jesus did not give his life for everyone, most people at the time was firmly against him.  I doubt he gave his life for anyone but himself, everything I've ever read or seen on the matter was about his self-rightiousness, and if he were the son of God and he did give up his life with full knowlege that he wouldn't actually die but would be resurrected, well...

20090205114157AAzDcK0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should Christian airline passengers be allowed to pass through security screening lines faster?	As professionals in the air/travel industry, airports often poll flight personnel asking their thoughts on airport efficiency and usability.  On a recent such poll, I gave what I believe to be a great idea:      Christian airline passengers should be given a security "fast pass" wherein they are subjected to the lowest level of security screenings at airport security checkpoints.  In fact, allowing them to keep their shoes on would be an act of good faith on the part of the Travel Security Administration.           This will help them be on time for flights and will cut down on security line congestion during peak periods.  Who doesn't want shorter security screening lines?

I come from a very religious community, most of my family and friends are Catholic (I'm atheist). I like hanging out with them and stuff, but it's sometimes hard for me to take their CHEESY relationships seriously!! Some of them have never questioned their faith and pride themselves on not having the problem of questioning it. (this kind of drives me silently crazy although i have become a little vocal about how it's not a problem to question religious things) -- My brother's girlfriend is one of these pridefilled people, it's hard for me to take their relationship seriously even though they've been together for almost a year, I'm hoping for my brother to wake up and break it offf with her! their relationship is about as exciting as a piece of toast.. I think I need to get away from this tighty nit community, I just don't belong!!

La idea de que sólo una persona religiosa puede ser buena es completamente ridícula. De hecho, quizá sean los ateos los verdaderamente buenos; tratamos de hacer lo que es correcto no por la razón egoísta de un miedo a algún castigo en la otra vida, sino porque sabemos que es lo correcto

20090205094541AA3QsdS	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do African Americans Look the Same?	This is my theory on the subject, people such as african americans and asians ect all have common facial features of dark hair and dark eyes. African americans hair is curly and asians all have straight hair but there noses are similar in shape, flat and wide. AAs have the darkest skin while asians skin is slightly darker than a caucasions.         Caucasions on the other hand are more diverse in their features. The color of the eyes for instance vary dramatically from blue to green to hazel and every color in between. The hair ranges from blond to red to brown/burnette and much more.The nose potrudes farther out in lentgh, they can also tan their bodys to obtain a natural bronze color which will protect from the suns rays and can drop the tan when its not necessary to soak up the sun such as when its winter.Its like taking off and putting on a sunscreen when you want. No other race of people has as many of these variances.

20090205110513AAEJIyN	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is Racism A Double Standard?	For instance when blacks hate whites, it's Ok. When poor blacks get gov money and funding for college more than poor white ppl, it's ok.  When only 5% of blacks vote for a white guy, it's ok.  ....But if the tables were turned and McCain got 95% of the white vote and Obama only got 5% then everyone would scream "racism" and inequality. If you want equality, the same needs to apply to everyone, no matter if they're white or not. so who's really the racist ppl here?           P.S. I didn't vote for McCain....just using him as an example of the reverse inequality.

In many places of worship, there is only the crucifix with Jesus Christ and nothing else. I understand that Jesus is God's Son, we should all follow His way of life, and avoid sin by only worshipping Him. But The Virgen Mary, Saints, and Angels are God's creation, servants, and elected people/spirits that people can also seek comfort, pardon, help, and petitions at any time.

My fiance has been working almost 70 hours a week for the past 11 months to help his company get out of their hole.  I give him a back rub at least 3 times a week and plenty of 'happy time'.

20090205112525AAlzf4k	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	These friends of mine claim to be Christian, yet feeds me negativity/control. Advice?	All they do is say how I'm this HORRIBLE person with no qualities, can't do anything, am Sh9t, won't amount to anything, a sinner, a bad person, etc....and mind you, I'm no terrorist, or criminal or even did anything really that bad in life, I'm just another guy,   yet they claim to be my friends and tell me all of that stuff, meanwhile one of them used to be a drug dealer and sex addict, and is now cleaned up and the other one is pretty near white tr@sh.      I befriended them because of Christianity, but instead of showing me God's love, etc, they instead tell me all about surrendering myself to God, how I'm sh9t, how I'm nothing, how God is everything, and what not. They cite and quote scripture pretty well but they're pretty controlling, self-righteous, and "look down" on me.      one of them was like "I don't give a sh9t how you feel!  surrender to the lord!" These people really don't give a rats a99 about me, I personally think they've just experienced their own life hardsihps and now look to God as an easy way out, and that's that.            How should we deal with other Christians that want to spew hatred, control and "you're gonna burn" at us, instead of filling us with love, compassion, kindness and what not?      I mean they literally HATE rational thought and think it's all the devil.      Writing books, producing movies, working and thinking about things that aren't somehow including "God" in it,...is just a sin, and you need to repent, and if not, you're going to have to face up to it on judgement day.         I mean that's all pretty d2mn harsh, and mean.

20090205124029AAMxie6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pastor "too busy" to keep commitments to congregation?	I've been attending the same church now for 8 years. About 3 years ago the pastor that was originally there when I started at that church left, and we immediately got a replacement. It seems like to some of his congregation he keeps his appointments but with me (and my family) he seems to constantly cancel, or postpone them. For example, nearly 2 months ago we had scheduled to meet with him about some personal matters (looking for church/Christian advice) and he has repeatedly put us off. My husband is highly frustrated, I'm slightly irritated and have considered switching churches, but I don't know if that is the solution. I do understand that he has two children and has been working on his doctorate, but I still think his JOB is to take care of his congregation. It just seems so constantly that he calls off our meetings (with barely any advance, maybe 20 minutes if we're lucky). Is this common in most churches? Should we seek out another church, in the same denomination, and start attending there?

I'm not sure why some Western Buddhists think there's such a big difference. Just because it's a little different than the Hindu idea of reincarnation, doesn't mean it's not reincarnation. Rebirth fits the dictionary definition of the word "reincarnation." When you die, your consciousness continues.

I know why; but why do you worship the evil one?        You know his promises are false but yet you still believe and follow him.  You are too ignorant like everyone else to believe in Jesus Christ and what he taught; so you have to find something that fits you and won't contradict your life style of living.  that is called lazy.  Plus you have a informed conscience that won't allow you to think for yourself or won't let you make your own decisions; so you have to follow the crowd and so those people tell you what to think and what to do.        Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle.  Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the devil; may God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all the other evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.

Apparently Atheists are trusted less than Muslims or gays (not that I hold prejudice against either group) I wondered if this was true. I searched on Youtube for videos about atheists to see if there were any negative feelings, there were, and to my surprise individual Youtube users will go after each other, back and forth, trying to disprove what the other claims is true. Sometimes it seems like a holy war. Could any one tell me how long this "skirmish" has gone on over Youtube?
20090205141729AAiVrLY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are your opinions on Christians spreading the "word of God"?	Many Christians respect other people's decisions when it comes to religion. However, some Christians will press the subject. They may tell another person they are on the "wrong" path, or that they are doomed to hell. Or they may urge someone of a different religion/belief to learn about Christianity and follow it's teachings. Some may tell these things in a "polite" manner (out of concern, perhaps), while others may be plain rude.      I'm looking for personal opinions- are these actions by Christians justified by the fact that they believe in eternal torture for those who do not follow and accept Jesus and the teachings of the Bible? Are their words excusable because they feel they are doing what's best?      Or is this urging of others to accept their god and Christ in any way disrespectful? Do you see it as arrogant?      Though I no longer have belief in Jesus, hell/heaven, etc, I was once Christian, and the idea of eternal suffering is a horrible concept. I can understand their concern. However, speaking of their concern to others/ talking about religion, and actually pushing it on someone else are two very different things. Once a Christian (or another else for that matter) tells me I am on the wrong path and should return to Jesus, I find it disrespectful and arrogant of them.

20090205141943AAC4pjh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it wrong for my school to try to make me a liberal?	This is a private school, so of course it's legal.    However, much of the school's curriculum is based on a very liberal world-view.    While they don't seem to directly try to guide us into any particular belief system, their viewpoints are very clear. We learn a lot about philosophy in required classes, and often end up writing papers about essays and stories that denounce organized religion.    This year, seniors are required to take a class entitled 'SEEDS,' which is about something called "social entrepreneurship." Basically we're required to put together a project with the theme of environmentalism, service, social change, etc. Political activism is never explicitly stated as a goal, but of course it's a possibility.
