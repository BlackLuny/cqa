byB1GEWQaa	Yes it is true,<br>  They seem always nice to me|`|8sMr9Vmtaa	See <a href="http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.c...</a><br>  The site explains compatibility between all possible combinations among the zodiacal signs, with emphasis on relationships.|`|cZhxp9f4aa	When Cancer and Scorpio make a love match, the resulting relationship draws together the energies of two emotionally intense Signs. Signs such as these often combine well, each partner's strengths balancing the other's weaknesses. These Signs feel a strong sexual attraction, and when they are together the temperature in the room tends to rise! Cancer and Scorpio have a great deal in common, and much potential to keep their relationship passionate and going strong. <br>  <br>  Cancer and Scorpio enjoy buying things together and creating a comfortable living space: Cancer craves security and Scorpio strives for power. Both occupy their minds with thoughts of domestic goods and resources, including stocks, bonds and inheritances. Since they are both concerned with the home and have fierce loyalties to the family group, Cancer and Scorpio complement each other well. They both see life as a passionate and deeply emotionally exercise of human connection. <br>  <br>  The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, while Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power) both rule Scorpio. Thanks to Pluto's powerful influence, this is an intense combination of Planets, but it's also a good balance of masculine and feminine energy. These two Signs coming together form the basic foundation of human relationships -- The Moon's nurturing love and Mars' ambition and passion. The Moon and Mars go well together; the Moon is about growth and rebirth, and Mars is about the passion of romance. Scorpio, influenced by that Martian energy, is smoldering and intense, and emotional Cancer is attracted to this intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the adoration inherent to Moon-ruled, nurturing Cancer. <br>  <br>  Cancer and Scorpio are both Water Signs. Both are very deep Signs and, like the ocean, you can never really see to the bottom of these two. Scorpio and Cancer may draw further and further into themselves, then suddenly roar back with intimidating force. Loyalty is strong with this love match, thanks to their mutual desire for emotional security. But while Cancer fixes their emotional energy on the family and home, Scorpio focuses more on life's nuances and undertones, the secrets behind other's intentions, the power they can wield over other's emotions. Scorpio can take Cancer on a journey beyond the literal surface of things, and Cancer's expansive heart can open Scorpio up to their own emotions, teaching their Scorpio mate that feeling is nothing to fear. Additionally, Scorpio appreciates their Cancer mate's practicality, and Cancer really enjoys Scorpio's jealousy -- it proves that Scorpio really loves and cherishes them. <br>  <br>  Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Once this couple have a common wish, it will come true. However, if their opinions clash, look out! Cancer will be the first to instigate an argument and Scorpio the last to finish it. Cancer may seem to act as the dominant partner and manage to get their way more often, but that isn't always the truth. Sometimes Scorpio won't even agree to disagree, they just might pretend to give in. Neither Cancer nor Scorpio are beyond using emotional manipulation to get revenge. Rather than letting disagreements and bad feelings boil over, these love partners must discuss what's truly important to them in order to reach an equitable compromise. Once Scorpio and Cancer learn to trust and believe in one another, they can achieve almost anything through sheer determination. This love relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot overcome their opinionated, stubborn sides. <br>  <br>  What's the best thing about the Cancer-Scorpio love match? Their powerful teamwork when they agree on their goals. When Cancer realizes that Scorpio is there for the long haul and that the partnership is emotionally productive, this relationship can blossom. Their mutual determination makes theirs a relationship of formidable strength.|`|1jwk8LHAaa	hi you can found information about your problem in this blog <a href="http://drugtreatmentforcancer.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://drugtreatmentforcancer.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <br>  thx:)

I think that, due to the research I've done, this would be most likely to be found in...<br>  <br>  Tauruses<br>  OR...<br>  Capricorns.<br>  Aries are also a possible results, but only for some of those features. <br>  We aries tend to get moody and/or frustrated very often and are very likely all from pampered and/or rich families and are often very pampered and sometimes rich themselves. We may keep the same job, or for that matter, the same man, lolz, if both/one keeps us satisfied for quite a while. It takes a lot to impress us pampered ones and for the less fortunate, they are very easily impressed.<br>  Capricorns and Virgos are almost certain results for these features,actions, time lengths, satisfactions, jobs and career changes. Aries are very possible results for these types of behavior.<br>  Good luck with your answers! :D|`|xEWVqdwnaa	-Change careers in their mid 50s?<br>  Aquarius<br>  <br>  -Stay at the same job for 30 years?<br>  Taurus<br>  <br>  <br>  -End up on drugs?<br>  capricorn, scorpio<br>  <br>  -Get into a drunken bar fight?<br>  scorpio, taurus<br>  <br>  -Become a doctor?<br>  scorpio, cancer<br>  <br>  -Become a stripper?<br>  leo<br>  <br>  -Get into the fashion industry?<br>  gemini leo|`|74PavKCAaa	Aries!!<br>  -because they have the most energy and willpower out of any of the signs.|`|3hqKWJi2aa	A Capricorn is most likely to stay at the same job for 30 years.,|`|9f889772267db189fec27ce11509fa56aa	a capricorn|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	Ask Ms Cleo dude...she knows for sure|`|NBBkHs8laa	Re Re pretty much got it lol|`|kAJdAbKXaa	Cancer: Get into the fashion industry.|`|BkzbJCHIaa	Taurus|`|MQm8QtL9aa	taurus or capricorn|`|plBXp91Daa	Change careers in their mid 50s?<br>  Probably Capricorn<br>  <br>  -Stay at the same job for 30 years?<br>  <br>  Aquarius<br>  -End up on drugs?<br>  Could be every sign.<br>  <br>  -Get into a drunken bar fight?<br>  <br>  Cancer<br>  <br>  -Become a doctor?<br>  Virgo<br>  <br>  -Become a stripper?<br>  Same answer like become a druggie<br>  <br>  -Get into the fashion industry?<br>  Leo.|`|g2jCrkcPaa	-Change careers in their mid 50s?

I was fortunate enough to be able to help my mother, with the help of my teenage daughter, care for him.  He wanted to be cared for at home and he wanted to die at home.  We were all blessed enough to have that happen.  My brother died a year earlier of pancreatic cancer and he was not so fortunate, his care was around the clock and just could not be done at his home, by his loving wife.  He was 46 when he died.  He was my only and older sibling.<br>  Write to me sometime, I am using a computer at a public library because my computer crashed so it could be awhile before I get back to you.  0x0x0 Lisa.

Naruto is originally Japanese, and anything that is released in Japan originally, doesn't come to the US for sometimes years, because they like to make the rest of the world suffer<br>  >:(|`|i4P8eFiAaa	all i can say is that he must be pretty busy with shippuden and that the drawings he makes or did make take lots of time and if you want the animated version to keep coming out stuff is going to have to be delt with.|`|WDUYSViWaa	i noticed that towards the end of the first series the animation style changed,It looked more like something from pokemon.<br>  They went back to the old style for the shippuuden series.|`|QmOmbprOaa	cause he smokes too much weed|`|s499ITvoaa	I noticed this too, maybe it's because:<br>  a) Kishimoto has a larger workload and has to draw more often, hence the detailed drawing are a thing of the past...<br>  or b) He is more influenced by the anime now.|`|f92qLn2Vaa	They started to use cheaper artist on naruto because there spending most of their time on naruto shippuuden and an upcoming series Jiraiya Hentai Adventures
xQikpqX3aa	I really do like kate , Claudia is a *****|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I'm getting quite annoyed with this Kate/Connie character.  I hate the way she treats her cousin and it's working my nerves how she's all up in Sonny & Claudia's marriage.  If you're gonna tell Sonny what Claudia did, do it already and stop making threats like you're somebody to be afraid of.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I like her, she brought out a side of Sonny that is rarely seen, The playful, smiling side of Sonny. That is it though, she wasn't always a fashion snob, she was a plain jane girl from Bensonhurst with a dream. It has been said that Kate and Olivia grew up more like sisters, sister fight and treat each other like garbage sometimes. Plus, Olivia has a son with Sonny, who was your man in those days, wouldnt you be ticked? Him and Claudia....she is responsible for his son being shot, how on Earth is that perfect???|`|sJs0nuTSaa	Yes, I love Sonny and Claudia together.  She's definitely the type of female he should be with.  I can't stand Kate.  She's keeping the truth about Dante from Sonny, she kept the truth about Dr. Devlin before he died, and she knows the truth about Claudia and isn't telling.  Yet she goes on and on about Carly, Olivia and Claudia being liars!  She goes on and on about how they are jealous of her and Sonny's relationship!  Yet she's not telling him the truth about Michael because she's jealous he won't leave Claudia for her.  I wish the writers would get rid of her.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i dont like her at all. she thinks she is so much better then every one?|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I can't stand her, I wish she would die.|`|AA12315431	I am not liking Kate either but come on, let's compare sins here. What's worse Kate not telling Sonny about Dante or Claudia being responsible for Michael being a vegetable? I don't care if she intended to do it or not. Let's not forget who Claudia intended to kill in the first place. Sonny! Now she is married to him! How messed up is that? Claudia may be the more versatile entertaining character of the two but she is extremely dangerous. Kate never really hurt anyone. She may be a self righteous snob but she is clearly the lesser of the two evils. Sonny and Claudia may make more sense as a couple but she has caused him so much pain already that he doesn't even know about. A match made in heaven? I think not. I find it interesting that everyone is so quick to forgive Claudia. Saying that she made a mistake is a gross understatement.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	I liked the idea of "first love" and the side of Sonny she initially brought out; however, the more I got to know her, the more I could not stand her!  If they keep it up, she could easily be on her way to get most hated character award.  I also have felt that Kate has some influence  in Michael's shooting; she duped love-struck Sonny into following his heart, instead of his mind, by taking Michael into work, just to take an opportunity to up one on Carly and get closer to Sonny and Michael.  She is such a manipulator, and really a downright nasty person. I also agree about Sonny & Claudia; teaming up they could be top kingpins, and a hot couple too.|`|EhBF31evaa	I did think the storyline was pretty good when she first showed up in PC, BUT, after I found out that she was ashamed of where she came from, my feelings towards her character changed drastically.  I think she is a snob and she treats all the people around her like dirt.  Maxie has proved herself to be a loyal and capable employee and yet Kate still treats her like crap.  She talks to Olivia like she is a dog and she just comes across like she is better than everyone else.  I wish Carly or Claudia would kick her self righteous butt.  I don't like the fact that Claudia was involved in Michael's shooting but I do believe she is really sorry for her involvement (and not just because she is afraid of what Sonny will do).  I think it will all work out though.  I think that Michael will wake up sometime around the time that the whole truth comes out.  I think she and Sonny are perfect together.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Watching Kate makes me wanna puke !<br>  Kate is a phony; a self righteous, pompous, cold, conniving, backstabbing, underhanded, petty, two faced bee-yotch who's forgotten who she really is; a total farce from the slums of Bensonhurst.  How many secrets has Kate kept from Sonny especially about Dante being Sonny's son and that Claudia is responsible for the Michael shooting.  How quickly she changed her mind about snitching on Claudia to Sonny because Kate can't bear the thought that Sonny chose Claudia over her so now she's going to make Sonny pay; what a bee-yotch!<br>  I totally agree with you on Sonny and Claudia being the perfect match compared to Sonny and Kate.  I only wish that Claudia would just snap that chicken neck of Kate and be rid of that nuisance gnat named Kate.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|M1ymLE9Paa	When Kate first came on the show, I thought her and Sonny were kind of interesting.  You know, that whole "high school sweethearts reunite" thing.  And I did like the idea of the show having more career-minded women on the show.  But as I've watched Kate, I like her less and less.  And I haven't liked her at all since she shouted at Carly at the hospital on the night Michael was shot.  What kind of person yells at a greiving mother?  To me she seems like a stuck-up, self-righteous, judgemental busy-body who needs to mind her own buisness.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure how to feel about Claudia.  I mean, she is the reason Michael was shot and I do think she deserves to pay for that.  But, in many ways, I have to agree, Claudia and Sonny are perfect for each other.  Plus, I like Claudia better than Kate, even after what she's done.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	I find Kate to be annoying. She never thanks anyone for being nice and gracious to her. And she has no story besides pining away for Sonny and running around tormenting people. Also Sonny never would have dated her now a days because she is highly social and has to be in the public's eye, Sonny is the complete opposite of that.|`|AA11261694	claudia is my favorite charcter so i think her and sonny are perfect together she knows what she is getting into with sonny and as far as micheal sonny had kidnapped johnny and beaten him and if someone had done that to someone sonny loved he would have retaliated to so he should understand where she is coming from i think they can really fall in love as far as kate i like her i think she desearves to find happiness i think she did love sonny she does need to lighten up on claudia|`|C4knGt7Iaa	I can't stand her...never have.  If *I* were Olivia, I'd've told her off loooong ago.  I'm liking Claudia and Sonny together but am worried about when Sonny finds out about her involvement in Michael's accidental shooting.  She may be running for her life after all.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	I automatically began to hate Kate after her 2007 premier when she got into with Carly over the boys crashing their remote control helicopter onto her recently cemented patio. When Claudia surfaced in Port Charles, I hated her, too. I still do, not only for basically shooting Michael, but for not helping Anthony while he was having his stroke. That has been bugging me for a while. And now that Kate is sticking it to Claudia, I'm beginning to warm up to. I'm still a little tore over her and Jax' one night stand, and I believe that Carly should've gone through with the shooting, but off Jax. But I believe that Carly got even by showing up to the Crimson bash in the same dress. So yes, Kate's slowly working her way onto my favorites list.|`|aQCF1pqIaa	I totally agree with you about Kate. I am so sick of her acting like she's so much better than everyone else and wish she would just go back to Manhattan and let Maxie takes over the office work for Crimson. She is such a freaking cry baby and thinks everyone should just bow down to her. UGH! It drives me NUTS! LOL <br>  <br>  As for Claudia, i think she does make a good couple with Sonny,I mean of course the original Carly would...LOL I think she is very sorry about what happened to Michael and eventually it will come out. However for right now I would like it to stopped being shoved in our face ever time we turn around. i mean let it go for a minute and bring it back like when Michael wakes up!|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Ugh, I despise Kate. She is so nasty to everyone. Her and Sonny were never good together. I hate the way she has treated Carly thru Michael's shooting. Claudia and Sonny are great for each other. I hope that when it comes out that Claudia was involved in the shooting that Sonny realizes she didn't mean for him to be shot and they work it out! Other than Carly I can't picture a more perfect match for Sonny. He needs a strong woman not a princess like Kate.|`|sGLRpQWvaa	I never really liked Kate. I thought she was too snobby and mean to everyone. And I really don't like that she's using Michael's shooting as a bargaining tool. I think Sonny will be more upset that Kate knew Claudia did and waited so long to tell him. She's playing with fire and will get burned.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	well me personally shes too posh to be dating a mob boss like seriously she makes him feel bad for getting her shot but then goes right back and when he marrys claudia wants him back its like make up your mind woman!<br>  <br>  and i dont really like claudia as a person, but she is much better with sonny then kate was (as long as he never finds out about the michael thing)|`|AA11068766	I want her to die.  I am soooooo wayyyy over her character.  Please claudia- kill Kate!|`|KAHrZLz3aa	I am sick of Kate|`|mrzbRd9Iaa	What a shame Anthony didn't do her in when he had the chance.  At leat he would've done SOME good in Port Charles!|`|cr5TQgmUaa	Can't stand her!

bvVG3Xnhaa	Ouran High School Host Club<br>  <br>  I've only seen the anime which was really good. The manga is probaly just as good too.<br>  <br>  The main plot of the story is about a girl who pretends to be a boy to pay off a debt she has made from breaking a vase. She has to be a "Host" for girls in a very rich school. The rest of the guys in the club all like her more or less.<br>  <br>  Dear School Gang Leader is a funny manga I started reading too. Its about a girl who goes to an all boys school because most of the girls have left. She ends up being the School Gang leader from some funny events. I would consider this a reverse harem because all the guys love her. With romance from one of the main guy characters.|`|hFgXi9cSaa	i got a girl pretending to be cool<br>  Shug chara<br>  <br>  boy pretending to be a monster<br>  Rosario + vampire|`|JbXaE93Oaa	Shuffle 5<br>  Angelic Layer<br>  Tokyo Mewmew series<br>  Sailor Moon Series<br>  Alien 9<br>  Azumanga Daioh<br>  Strawberry Panic<br>  His and Her Circumstances<br>  Ranma 1/2 (??)<br>  Ultra Maniac<br>  Alinchino<br>  <br>  All I can think of.|`|3xA6m6VDaa	Ouran High School Host Club<br>  <br>  Plot Summary: Haruhi is a poor tomboyish student at a school for the ultra-wealthy, able to attend because of a scholarship, and unable to even afford a uniform. One day, she stumbles across the decidedly peculiar but very popular Ouran Host Club. She tries to leave, but accidentally breaks a vase, and unable to pay for it, she's told that she'll have to stay and do odd jobs. That is, until they decide she would be more valuable as a club member. Not realizing she's female due to her appearance, they fix her up and give her a male uniform. She's an instant hit, so they decide to have her keep up the charade even after they find out the truth. Haruhi, being average almost to a fault, doesn't know what to make of the unconventional activities of the Host Club (or of the even more unconventional members), but having little choice, she plays along. Before long, real bonds are formed, friends made, and Haruhi finds herself accepted in a way she could never have been otherwise in this affluent school. <br>  <br>  Romeo x Juliet<br>  <br>  Plot Summary: This is a story of a young and tragic love, set in the aerial city of Neo Verona. Tyranny rules this island in the sky after the Montague family took control 14 years prior. The disparity among the wealthy and poor is apparent in the present state, the earth dries and water stagnates. The sky itself is wrapped in a deep dense fog. Both Romeo and Juliet's lineages are of present and past ruling families of Neo Verona. Romeo is the son of the current Montague dictator, Juliet (a beautiful woman) masquerades as a man (Odin), she's the last descendent of Capulet the previous rulers who were killed by an assasin's dagger 14 years ago. Her true background is not to be revealed to her until her 16th birthday. The cruel hands of fate introduces 2 people who will become "Star Crossed Lovers".|`|qXQIHCqGaa	Ouran High School Host Club<br>  Chibi Vampire<br>  Vampire Knight<br>  Maria Holic|`|4OB1G3Cpaa	I've read most of what you said there, and I really enjoyed Ouran High School Host Club.

bZsF1n0zaa	I was also thinking about this. (Spoiler below...but it's my answer...^__^)<br>  <br>  I always wondered why they said he cant get hurt by punches/kicks but when he got hit he was still hurt. Especially by nami, his granpa, other characters. I didn't make sense at first.<br>  <br>  Then in the most recent manga story we learned about Haki. Haki is like the will power of your spirit, spirit power or will power. It can be translated in different ways. One thing about Haki is that you are able to hurt Devil Fruit Users while using it. You can use Haki to hurt Logia type users! So I'm pretty sure it works with Paramecia fruit users like Luffy.<br>  <br>  So maybe it might not seem like much that nami or others can hurt him and it might be confusing to the story, but the author might be giving us hints that these characters (Nami, Sanji, Zoro, Garp, etc). that they posses Haki! Although some of them don't even know that they are using it, they are but don't realize it.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's how I see it so far.<br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|49MWkazAaa	i think it probably to make it look more cool and more fun. its the same thing with most mangas. ESpecially with naruto. he take an hour to beat enemies when he can just summon the toad.|`|KSC02NcLaa	Punches from Normal People don't affect Luffy, but Punches from say His Grandpa or people with above average strength do affect him.|`|s499ITvoaa	Haha, not all manga is terribly realistic, and One Piece is no exception.|`|54jdIXMoaa	That is because when he attacks (like punches and kicks), his fruit ability activates.  During relaxation or rest or whatever, he can be hurt since his ability is inactive/not-in-use, that's why Nami can hurt him or the enemies can sometimes hurt him.

flGXcxwGaa	well I guess it depends on what you like. I will just igve my favs from each category well the one I place it in anyways lol.<br>  <br>  Horror:<br>  Higurashi no Naku koro ni (Season One)<br>  Higurashi no Naku koro ni Kai( Season Two)<br>  Higurashi no Naku koro ni Rei (OVA)<br>  <br>  If you have not watched it yet you must must it all seasons. If you skip any eps you will be lost. Make sure while watching it that you do not accidently skip from season one to season two. It may not make much sense for the first ep but by the end of season 2 it will make sense so dont ruin it by looking up info on it.<br>  <br>  Elfen Lied<br>  It is only like 20 something eps but it is really good. Some parts are gore (many parts) but it has a really good story line and the charaters have good build up.<br>  <br>  Vampire Comedy:<br>  Karin<br>  It is a funny vampire movie about a vampire who instead of needing blood makes to much and must instead bite someone to give them her blood or she will have a major nosebleed.<br>  <br>  Moonphase<br>  This is one of my favs. It is a supernatural comedy horror type movie about a young Vampire Princess who is stuck up at first but then becomes a nicer vampire but still pretty hard headed. It is really good cute and still have lots of fighting.<br>  <br>  Other Vampire:<br>  The Vampire Knight<br>  I have only seen a few eps I am in the process of waching it.<br>  <br>  Trinity Blood<br>  It a sci fi vampire movie with very good graphics and at first I did not like it but as the story evolved and the charaters I begin to love it alot.<br>  <br>  Action:<br>  Inuyasha<br>  It is about a half demon and a umm something like reincarnated princess and there friends fighting against a "demon" over gathering shards of a jewl. <br>  <br>  Bleach:<br>  A soul reaper...ummm. I am not sure lol.. i am on season 2. As of now it is pretty much about a guy who is a temp. soul reaper or so and he is fighting to save the girl who gave him the powers against wicked deceased souls and other soul reapers. They grow in friends durning the time and they grow in power and so on. <br>  <br>  Black Cat:<br>  A group of bounty hunters, ex assassins and a biowepon girl trying to get food and protect the bio girl.<br>  <br>  Ergo Proxy<br>  A human and a robot and friends trying to uncover the secret of Proxy.<br>  <br>  Ummm I am not in the mood to give many more descriptions <br>  <br>  You should make a more exact type of anime that you like then maybe we can help more or so.|`|JbXaE93Oaa	Kiddy Grade<br>  Desert Punk<br>  Basilisk<br>  Origin<br>  Strait Jacket<br>  BlackJack<br>  Solty Rei<br>  Vampire Knight<br>  D.N.

The story follows a team of pirates/mercenaries known as Lagoon Company. They smuggle goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia. Their base of operations is located in the of Roanapur, and they transport goods in their torpedo boat, Black Lagoon. Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missions which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battles. If like mercenaries and gun battles!, gun battles!!, gun battles!!! This show is for you. Its definitely one of the most murderous show I think I've ever seen. Need I say more? This show is pretty hardcore so I'm just giving fair warning.<br>  <br>  Fate Stay Night (Action/romance/fantasy)<br>  <a href="http://justdubs.net/dubs/fate_stay_night.html" rel="nofollow">http://justdubs.net/dubs/fate_stay_night...</a><br>  <br>  the show is about the Holy Grail War which involves a series of battles among powerful sorcerers to fight for the possession of a relic that will grant one's wishes, the Holy Grail. There are altogether seven "Masters" who can summon their respective "Servants" from different classes known as Saber, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Lancer, Caster and Assassin. These "Servants" have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies because each one of the servants is an epic hero from earths past. The main character, Shirou Emiya, treat treats Saber just like any other woman and not like a servant which is something that she is not used too. Saber feels that she must fight without any care for what happens to herself, but Shirou, feels the exact opposite. He tries everything to keep her from getting hurt and often times ends up hurting himself in the process.<br>  <br>  IGPX (mecha/racing)<br>  <a href="http://www.jetwavetv.co.cc/JetWaveTV/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetwavetv.co.cc/JetWaveTV/</a><br>  <br>  The series follow Rookie team Satomi as the first enter into the big league IG-1. IG-1 races consist of two teams of three. They compete on a 60-mile track at speeds upwards of 350 mph. 1st place receives 15 points, 2nd receives 7 points, 3rd gets 5 points, ect. The objective is to complete three laps on the course without getting taken out. Each lap consists of a different stage. The 1st lap is just a setup lap to get a feel for the course and planning out strategy, but the 2nd lap is the battle round. In this lap you out right try to destroy your opponent on the course while race at 300 plus mile per hour. You want to do what what ever it takes to eliminate your opponent because if one of them doesn't finish it mean more point for your team. The third lap is the speed round were you convert into speed mode to try to get to the finish first.<br>  <br>  I'm not really one for racing, but I thought this series was original and really an exciting watch.

I have been with him for 12 yrs, and I still wait for 7 pm when he leaves, then give it another 2 hrs just to make sure he doesn't come back home in case he forgot something...|`|VHYIx8vcaa	I believe in an open-door policy once a person is married. Like open as in not locked, it doesn't have to be wide open. Just not locked so that you can't get in. <br>  <br>  I believe your significant other should be allowed to come in if they like or whatever reason, that's what I believe.|`|F8i3Ph9jaa	Yeah, my ex was very indiscreet with her bodily functions.<br>  <br>  If I was in the bathroom she had no qualms about coming in to pop a squat.

If I do, Elvis scratches at it until I let him in, so it's pointless.<br>  <br>  I always close the door for the wipeage because no one needs to see that, or if I'm going to have an especially squirty session, I'll close the door for that too.

LSn5iF47aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Days_(game)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Days...</a><br>  <br>  Yup, it was censored in most channels in Japan ( only one channel didn't censor it) but no altered plot (but you can see several ending outcomes of the School Days game on youtube)<br>  <br>  The day before the final episode was scheduled to air, a sixteen-year-old girl killed her father with an axe in Kyoto. In response, TV Kanagawa replaced the episode, which was known to contain similarly violent material, with half an hour of scenery and classical music to avoid association with the murder. Other stations airing the anime followed suit, except for AT-X, who remained indecisive at the time. In the following week, 0verflow announced that a screening of the episode would take place in the Tokyo area as part of the release of the series first DVD volume, and would require a copy of either the PC game or Summer Days PC game for admission. However, AT-X announced that they would air the last episode on September 27, 2007, with minor alterations in airing times. The screening of the episode that 0verflow announced showed the uncut version of episode twelve, including the blood color change from black back to red, adding back all sound effects that were removed from the broadcast version, and fewer flashbacks. The uncut version of the episode was included in the DVD release on February 27, 2008. [Fr. Wiki]

When Natalie said in a show "To bad he's from Texas."|`|QwCsFKLQaa	Right on chiks !!!<br>  <br>  F ameriKKKa|`|AA10356243	Basically a back handed comment on their country fans and country radio who dropped them for their (at that time) what was constructed as Anti-Bush sentiment when he was very popular. That and the fact Natalie opened her mouth in England instead of voicing her concerns here.<br>  <br>  Many stations in the American Heartland and South still won't play the Dixie Chicks to this day. Mainly areas that are conservative or voted republican in the last presidential election<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_ready_to_make_nice" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_ready_t...</a>|`|kivwSfpgaa	well a few years back, the Dixie Chicks had a concert in Europe somewhere and the lead singer made the comment that, "They are Ashamed that George Bush is from their home state of Texas". This caused an uproar because at this point, there were a not a whole lot of people speaking out against our Commander in Chief. Especially in the uber-conservative world of country music...<br>  <br>  If that was not enough, the Dixie Chicks then started attacking other country stars such as Toby Keith that were outspoken conservatives. Natalie Maines even wore a TSHIRT on a red carpet of an awards show that said "F.U.T.K" which they said meant something else but  one knew that it was an attack on Toby Keith. Then they went on to say that they were "Ahamed to be in the country music genre" and they dont even like country music.<br>  <br>  Basically they just kept digging themselves deeper and deeper into a hole and people across the country did not like that or what the Dixie Chicks stood for. there were CD burning (like fire burning) parties across the country and they even recieved death threats. (the lyrics "shut up and sing or my life will be over" appear in the song and was a true story). <br>  <br>  The song was pretty much saying that they dont even care about all the flack they were getting for being so outspoken and they dont regret anything they said..<br>  .<br>  of course all of the idiot liberals in the non-country genres voted  for the Dixie Chicks on all he grammy award ballots. ...i hate Hollywood....ugh.But its been a while since they've appeared on any country music shows :)

KeOPBpz8aa	It's rated R because of the torture, violence, and mistreatment to children.  It's not like torture from the Saw films or anything like that.  A lot of the scenes are hard to watch because it's hard to believe stuff like this actually exists.  It's graphic to show the reality of such issues.  But if you think you can stomache this (which you probably could), then it's an excellent film that everyone should see.|`|yjSvzCQLaa	The opening torture scene is frightening and intense. It would be possible to choose to watch and enjoy the film starting after this scene, i.e. once the lad is out of the cell and sitting in the office of the police chief.<br>  <br>  (Taken from imdb.com)|`|KMcjfeX7aa	It's not so bad, you could.

It's well worth seeing.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	there were some torture scenes but they weren't really intense so i think you could handle it. thankfully those parts aren't really long and the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. i think you'll really like it.

(R.I.P. Heath). so there probably won't be another movie in the batman series started with batman begins, but in about 10 years some other director will make another batman series of movies.|`|49MWkazAaa	probably joker and two face again|`|vApDLCeeaa	No they haven't made a script yet be paitent dude

7c8cf64e8be051f30ba145a7d5bb23d8aa	Es imprescindible tener un lado sensible. Imposible renunciar a él. Tengo la impresión, no sé hasta que punto cierta, de que me perjudica en algunos aspectos de mi vida(las personas con más exito, entedido desde un punto de vista de eficacia mercantilista o utilitarista son a menudo las más pobres emocionalmente. Hay mucho psicópata camaleonico en el mundo de la politica y los negocios, en la vida pública) pero jamás renunciaría a ese lado sensible, por nada en el mundo porque me beneficia y mucho en otras facetas de mi vida... creo que me beneficia porque me permite desarrollar una vida interior que a fin de cuentas es la que le da solidez y equilibrio a mi propia vida. A veces es más dificil y apasionante lidiar y navegar por el mar de los sentimientos que por otros mares de la vida... el que sale airoso de esa aventura está más curtido y se convierte en un árbol con unas raices más profundas mucho más dificil de derribar|`|Zjj2W1tbaa	Me perjudica...es como que me hago muy débil, después de haber vivido algo traumático, antes me beneficiaba !<br>  Beso|`|cb803fc09e5ae23411ed6e7b7620d825aa	beneficia.|`|74FzHHGCaa	Hmmmm pues.-- ya ni sé es que si soy muy sensible|`|0ce0038b85e667f36af67e3ce8387e83aa	Ahora que "he aceptado" no sólo que lo tengo, sino que es bueo y me hace más completo y más humano. <br>  Me beneficia.

Los problemas surgen cuando mostramos ese lado sensible en el momento incorrecto.A veces es bueno mostrarnos vulnerables y no como un hombre de acero sin sentimientos, aun en las situaciones más serias y racionales.|`|pvhcUXojaa	Supongo que me beneficiará porque si no lo tuviese me habrían dado ya 12 infartos de miocardio, con brutísima que soy a veces...<br>  <br>  Me ayudais, por favor???<br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AikXbgadthdi2vUS.oZ0XjZo.gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080515123606AAqup4M">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|EARCwX71aa	me humaniza<br>  beneficia a los démas y en algunas ocasiones me perjudica a mi pero lo hago con gusto|`|O3ftqCfxaa	beneficia|`|XG1VxPG8aa	Me perjudica generalmente, aunque en ocasiones me ayuda.|`|XORZsFnyaa	yo creo que me beneficia|`|4zwiOm37aa	a veces me abruma,, me hundo!!... depende de qué, yo preferiría ser más "fuerte"|`|5eiFOcbiaa	quiero pensar que me beneficia ya que con lo hecho debido a eso me hace sentir bien como persona.<br>  <br>  pero ya es cuestion de cada quien.<br>  <br>  saludos.|`|69FsOpLPaa	Me perjudica pero ya lo estoy educando xD<br>  para perderlo completamente.|`|l50Yrb5Iaa	Esa respuesta se las dejo a ustedes...|`|DlHrw5e5aa	no tengo lado sensible jejeje <br>  no la verdad es que aveces me beneficia y otras no pero en general no|`|sSpfuHMqaa	Me tiene sin cuidado, la sensibilidad nunca perjudica, nos humaniza.|`|EH42t2fUaa	pero claro ami me super perjudica es lo peor que me puede pasar tengo que ponerme un caparazón para no salir lastimada, ufff<br>  pero bueno viéndolo por el lado positivo, me gusta el tener buenos sentimientos.<br>  besitos ????|`|wSuBKoFYaa	los 2, no seas demasiado bueno, te lo digo de verdad, porque se pueden aprovechar de ti y tenerte lástima, pero también ten un lado amable, hací tendrás muchos amigos y ellos confiarán en tí, ten mucho cuidado con las amistades!!<br>  <br>  salu2!!  ; )|`|F8SNtnacaa	me perjudica, ya que soy demasiado sensible..<br>  y aveces c aprovechan d ello.|`|Fjp4gJBgaa	me beneficia y mucho jejeje|`|J9QREcNlaa	me beneficia siento pena por los demas y trato de ayudarlos|`|OOgpn1QLaa	En partes iguales<br>  Pero lo que me beneficia es lo que me importa<br>  De lo otros, me hago cargo<br>  <br>  bru|`|QbA3dKoQaa	Pienso que me perjudica, estamos en un mundo en el que mientras más sensible y vulnerable te muestres más se aprovecharan de ti, por eso trato de tomar cierta distancia al principio..

yvGqWtPBaa	It was on tonight.  D woods and Aubrey were kicked out.  They had a LIVE reunion show on mtv with Puff appearing on satellite.  D woods didn't show up because of prior engagements.  The tension was so thick you could have cut it with a knife.  Aundrea and Dawn acted like they HATED Aubrey when she appeared at the end.  Puff said that he was not the bad guy and that Aubrey had changed and gotten prideful.  All Aubrey had to say to Puff was that she liked his shirt (I LOVE MICHELE OBAMA shirt)  This made me laugh because she wasn't about to back down to Puff or the girls.  Aubrey seemed OVER DK, although I could tell that she still loved the girls.  They did not feel the same way about her though.|`|pUTCxzVGaa	I would like to know the same thing.

994e549f2daefce082890d6f4169969eaa	Yo la ví y leí el libro también. Me gustó muchísimo y como suele suceder en el libro hay cosas que no están en la película y viceversa. Según el libro, el perfume que elabora Grenuille puede llegar a manipular el deseo y el amor en las personas que lo huelen, excepto en él mismo, tal como se vió en la escena de la orgía, sólo le bastaron unas tres gotas para eso. <br>  <br>  Muy decepcionado decidió morir, y sabiendo el poder de su perfume,  fué a un parque donde habían mendigos y frente a ellos vació todo el contenido de su frasco de perfume sobre sí mismo.  Eso provocó un deseo inmenso en los mendigos que lo abrazaron al principio, lo besaron y le quitaron la ropa, pero  eso no les bastó, deseaban a Grenuille para ellos, los besos se convirtieron en mordiscos y a mordiscos murió. Es decir que se lo comieron. Y por eso dicen los mendigos al final que aquello fué lo primero que habían hecho por amor.<br>  Saludos.|`|c2d47f4e68082be5d9b7c26fea4d9b9faa	Gracias por la recomendacion la tendré que ver<br>  Saludos|`|c5ee0ae6dbabf891707f9f2ca014433eaa	La verdad no me gusto, se me hizo aburrida y el ambiente un poco lugubre, ademas de sucia, entiendo que esta adaptada a  la epoca, pero de todos modos no me gusto.|`|ed370962f4edce30171efc57784e9b0faa	No la he visto aun en el cine, por que estoy empezando a leer primero el libro, es mucho mas emocionante leer el libro y ya luego ver la pelicula que ver primiero la peli y despues el libro.

Luego se fue a su pueblo, en donde la gente al parecer no era capaz de amar a nadie. Allí se vacía la botella de perfume y es tal el alboroto que causa y tanta la euforia por estar junto a el, que todos terminan por comérselo. No desaparece, se lo comen todos los que se encuentran en el pueblo.

WsA4xeAzaa	Porque el canal no se hace responsable de los productos. Por ejemplo: Si hay una crema para rejuvenecer y solo es publicidad, el canal no te responde a ti. El solo cobra por anunciar los productos, es por eso que los logos siempre son de la marca del producto. Ciao!|`|EQguWghIaa	Porque el que paga la publicidad paga para que vean su producto, y no para publicitar un canal.|`|pr2pJrbpaa	los comerciales no solo salen en un solo canal, por eso!! para que identificar el canal en un comercial, es parte de la propaganda,??, no verdad?, solo importa la publicidad, el canal es solo un medio|`|wqcbmNSmaa	porque no solo en un canal pasan los comerciales y la gente ve diferentes canales.|`|4f7a32f6ff0ac915c8ffa2beca2efa63aa	Me imagino por que de pronto el ligo del canal puede llegar a ocultar alguna información del comercia como esta ensima de pronto tapa un teléfono o una posposición general del producto...|`|k1gxCmcZaa	Porque la televisora o el canal en el que pasan el comercial, no tiene derecho sobre el comercial, normalmente los logos del canal q vez aparecen solamente durante la programacion del mismo, las televisoras venden los tiempos de comerciales a todas las empresas que se anuncian, es como si te anunciaras gratis en algo que no es tuyo.|`|dmAyZ0caaa	Porque el canal no tiene derechos para presentar el logo en los comerciales, puesto que los comerciales son de dominio público y se ven en muchos canales.|`|0eb8e13c1513240926e9789f0501b936aa	Porque les da verguenza las porquerías de anuncios que pasan y tienen la esperanza de que no los relacionen con ellos.<br>  jajaja<br>  <br>  Lo siento, es una broma.

A los 2 días de haberse ido recibí una carta por encomienda y era de el,  a partir de ese día y durante 4 a?os nos escribimos una carta por día (en ese entonces no había Internet) y nos veíamos una vez al a?o cuando el viajaba a Argentina a ver a sus hermanos y a verme a mi, después de esos 4 a?os yo me fui a vivir a USA y ahí nos casamos, ya pasaron 18 a?os desde esa noche de a?o nuevo, tengo 3 hijos con ese hombre tan maravilloso, el es verdadero amor de mi vida.<br>  Los amores a larga distancia aunque parezcan imposibles MUCHAS veces resultan... como para que lo pienses.<br>  Un abrazo grande.|`|DrHFJ9HLaa	RIVER  ?

HpclYZtOaa	Querida amiga Tara:<br>  <br>  Es una pregunta muy interesante.<br>  Responder me parece difícil, complicado, no porque no sepa expresarme, sino porque no es una respuesta para definirla con un SI/NO o BLANCO/*****.<br>  <br>  Primero, creo que definir alguien tímido es difícil. Los tímidos no son todos iguales. Además creo que uno podría comportarse con timidez en algunas situaciones y en otras no.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, podría suceder que si ella no lo conoce lo suficiente a el.... pensara que es tímido cuando en realidad lo que sucede es que el no está interesado en ella. <br>  <br>  Otras veces ha sucedido que ellos dan "se?as" de interés, cuando en realidad parece que necesitan solamente sentirse bien de saber que son deseados...(humm..) pero si los "apuras" salen corriendo... = )<br>  <br>  Y AQUí DESDOBLO LA RESPUESTA....<br>  <br>  RESPUESTA No 1<br>  <br>  Sabes lo que es importante, difícil de lograr a veces... pero importante... que ellas (ustedes) vean la forma de "sincronizar" y "sintonizarse" de modo tal que estén atentas para saber cuándo tomar la iniciativa  para que ellos (nosotros) no nos demos cuenta.... Y ustedes Tara, tienen la habilidad para eso.<br>  <br>  Me causa mucha gracia cuando he escuchado a conocidos y amigos contando su "haza?a" de haberse "levantado" a Fulana de Tal.... Y entusiasmados cuentan en detalle lo que hicieron para conquistarlas.... ?no se dan cuenta que en realidad la Fulana de Tal y la Mengana, se encargaron de conquistarlos a ellos,... pero lo hicieron de tal modo que no se dieron cuenta.<br>  <br>  Los hombres no existimos como conquistadores. Casi siempre eligen ustedes. A veces pienso que solamente podemos elegir entre las que nos eligieron a nosotros....pero ?cuidado de nosotros! entre las amigas ya se distribuyeron los candidatos (nosotros) y mucho cuidado nosotros pues si en un grupo no nos damos cuenta de quién somos "elegido" y nos queremos hacer los galanes con las amigas de "ella" allí podríamos terminar crucificados....<br>  <br>  RESPUESTA No 2<br>  <br>  Pueden  encontrarse (hay pocos) hombres que realmente se comporten como tales, y con seriedad. Amabilidad, alegría, risa, chistes,... pero con seriedad. Es difícil describirlo. Pero existen aquellos que no son tímidos ni tampoco súper extrovertidos... se manejan con equilibrio y toman con seriedad las amistades, entendiéndose con seriedad no estar con el rostro adusto y cara de perro....no. Debe ser amable, amigable, caballero, pero... guardar las galanterías únicamente para quien él quiera.<br>  Cuando yo era adolescente, (piensa cuándo.... pues nací en 1949... ?ups!) Digo que cuando yo era adolescente escuche que algunos mayores decían “hombres éramos los de antes” y puesto que siempre respeté lo que decían los mayores, yo tomaba en cuenta lo que decían pero no creía que fuera tan así. Pensaba que “los de antes” estaban pasados de moda. Creía que “la verdad” la teníamos nosotros. Paz, amor y rock’n’roll. The Beatles, Rollig Stones, Creedence ?y viva el rock’n’roll...!<br>  <br>  Luego de haber vivido “un tiempo” desde mi adolescencia hasta ahora (cuéntalo) me encuentro con el problema que yo no puedo decir “hombres éramos los de antes”, solamente puedo decir a mis amigos jóvenes (unos cuantos de la edad de mi hija y otros algo menos) como debe ser “un hombre de ahora”. No digo “hombre éramos los de antes” ni digo “hombre eran los de más antes”..... sino que se decir cómo debe ser un “hombre de ahora” <br>  <br>  Se puede ser “un hombre de ahora”, con costumbres de ahora, con música de ahora, y con todo como ahora.... pero ser un hombre.<br>  <br>  INTRODUCCIóN A LA CONCLUSIóN:<br>  <br>  Para ser un hombre de ahora, también aconsejo entrar en Yahoo! Respuestas y estudiar cuidadosamente las preguntas de mi amiga Tara y de otras.... y estudiar bien las respuestas.... ?por qué? <br>  <br>  Porque para ser un hombre, se necesita saber como es una mujer.<br>  <br>  CONCLUSIóN DE LA RESPUESTA:<br>  <br>  ?Toma la iniciativa amiga! Solamente hazlo de modo que él no se de cuenta.<br>  <br>  Un beso grande y abrazos gratis<br>  <a href="http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=vr3x_RRJdd4" rel="nofollow">http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=vr3x_RRJdd...</a><br>  <a href="http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=UGYO86KwCUc" rel="nofollow">http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=UGYO86KwCU...</a><br>  <br>  Francky <br>  .|`|06f070beb0008b33ce6ffb2edde97a0eaa	si<br>  <br>  por que no?|`|2OoIYEOQaa	Generalmente creo que si...aunque hay gente que es tan tímida...que hasta lo intimida que sea primero el otro el que de el primer paso....saludos!!chau chau|`|6Li79NiXaa	creo que todos siempre estamos esperando que sea la otra persona quien tome la iniciativa lamentablemente.|`|LNGjOn8laa	si<br>  saludos tara|`|NdBid3T4aa	Por supuesto! <br>  <br>  Creeme que de esa forma nos ahorrarian mucho trabajo...

ltY4ocyzaa	Honestamente no.-<br>  <br>  Pero te comento algo curioso, muchos "discriminados" son los primeros en poner la barrera y alejar a las demás personas, con el pretexto de que los van a discriminar o no los van a entender. <br>  También hay que considerar que hacerle ver a una persona que se hace da?o así misma y a los que le rodean no es discriminación, es preocupación.<br>  <br>  En el caso de alguien con problemas drogas, lo primero que hace es alejarse de sus familiares y amigos que no se drogan porque nunca va entender y se sienten más identificados con los que si porque esos "si son sus amigos y si los entienden". ?Quién discrimina a quién? <br>  <br>  <br>  Bueno, espero te ayude mi opinión.|`|OqWqdR3Caa	mira te podría decir que no discrimino a las personas que veo en la calle pero si me pongo a reflexionar lo que hago en el hogar tengo que darme cuenta que sutilmente humillo a mi pareja al hacer comentarios hirientes o también pensando generando fantasias por medio de mis emociones mal encauzadas  maltratando sicologicamente y por consiguiente a mis hijos que se puede esperar de mi si tienes un defecto físico o mental y de casualidad te encuentro en la calle|`|Y8vXAfQRaa	no, claro que no, respeto los putnso de vista de todos<br>  <br>  y su forma de ser...<br>  <br>  sludos|`|fb95b88ec7ec83d45c4f69111203c660aa	La verdad es que yo siempre trato de no discriminar, pero se me hace muy dificil, pues hay veces que no se puede.

s9ZxNOJ5aa	Se lo via explicar con dos ejemplos, o mejor dicho con dos muy malos ejemplos que son mis dos nietos. De adolescentes, uno era rockero y fanático de Los Redondos de Ricota, y el otro, medio mariconcito pobre, moría por Soda Stereo. El asunto es que el rockero era muy sucio, pasaban semanas y el muy cochino usando el mismo calzoncillo. Las medias a veces no parecían medias, parecían botas de cuero, y no le epsajero. El otro, comenzó imitando el luk de esos muchachos del sifón de soda musical, y andaba con los ojitos pintados y el pelito parado. Muy pronto empezó a probarse los calzones de la madre y le quedó gustando. Hoy sigue escuchando Soda stereo pero ya es toda una mujercita, si usté lo viera, joven, se enamora. Un amor mi nieto, que ahora es nieta pero bueno, no importa, para eso una es abuela y les teje bufandas cada invierno.<br>  A mi me hubiese encantado que escucharan a Salvatore Adamo, o a Manolo Galván, pero no pudo ser. Esos sí que eran hombres.|`|87cAKRkLaa	El estilo de musica que escuchan...|`|DQ4egzDEaa	La diferencia son los gustos musicales, saludos|`|JrXId9D9aa	no se depende por que hay veces que a la misma persona le gustan los dos generos.<br>  salud.0z|`|SLd5PUyNaa	los estilos musicales de cada genero y tambien a veces las ideologias y manera , costumbre de vida de las personas que escuchan esa musica.............<br>  <br>  <br>  ***BeSiToS***|`|iy5lclNJaa	LA MUSICA<br>  SALU2|`|sg4SsZMUaa	gustos musicales, nada mas, ninguno es menos que el otro.|`|y418RCYpaa	Los gustos por la musica.|`|52tcjKPFaa	ninguna porque las dos escuchan musica|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Su tolerancia para las percuciones!!!|`|iBRU1MGLaa	que uno diferencia la calidad de los intrumentos musicales y sabe de historia rockera y el otro solo la melodia o la voz del cantante<br>  ?|`|LospxwRtaa	Pues que les gusta diferentes tipos de música.|`|b52518909ba1fccf734d7ab40268191aaa	la diferencia va en gusto. Por ejemplo mas alla de ser dos estilos de musica diferentes, el rock y el pop tambien son estilo de vida. Sigo con las diferencias, un cantante de pop por ejemplo se pondria una remera ajustada al cuerpo con un jean que no sea necesariamente azul , zapatillas de esas con colores y de taco bajo. usaria rejoj y por lo general de pelo corto. Una chica pop usaria vestidito , de color claro, maquillaje suave, cartera . Las bebidas de los que escuchan pop seria los tragos de mezcla, margaritas, mojitos, martinis, etc. Cerveza , si tal vez. <br>  Ahora el rockero usa jeans azul o ***** , campera de cuero o de jean, pa?uelo atado en la cabeza o en el brazo, botas de taco alto, beben cerveza y fuman , mucho y de todo , jajaja. Las chicas rock , usan maquillaje un poco mas fuerte, aros grandes y la actitud tambien cambia. Son mas expresivas. Eso es lo que encuentro de diferencia , porque tanto el rock como el pop son movimientos no solo de musica , sino que expresan un modo de vivir....|`|fQVk6dAyaa	la musica??<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  besoossss|`|ww4D0UWMaa	el gusto por la musica...

vBl3oIJoaa	bueno yo he visto las dos en el cine y te puedo asegurar una cosa ,que Piratas del Caribe deja muy atras a Spiderman 3 Razones :<br>  soy un gran fanatico de los comics y me gusta la primera pelicula de spiderman y la segunda un poco pero en la tercera si que meten la pata ,primero por que el personaje de Peter Parker es cada vez mas infantil y mas comico  ,como por ejemplo la escena en la que empieza a bailar disco en la calle  es de las peores escenas que he visto en los ultimos a?os ,  no porque el tipo baile mal sino porque es algo completamente absurdo algo que no va con la historia , pero sigamos   ,  otra cosa es Venom  ,su dise?o por computadora es fenomenal pero  fijate que aparece los ultimos 20 minutos de la pelicula   por favooooooooorrr !!!!  y encima lo matan de una manera estúpida , yo creo que a venom le debieron dedicar una pelicula entera   y con un trama mas oscuro mas dramatico no con unas escenas de payasos    ... bueno te lo resumo  <br>  <br>  Spiderman 3:  <br>    peor guion<br>    peor secuela <br>    peor director<br>   buenos efectos especiales<br>  <br>  Piratas del Caribe :<br>  buen  guion <br>  mejor secuela<br>  buen director <br>  buenos efectos especiales<br>  y lo unico malo son unas escenas de mas que ridiculizan mucho a Jack Sparrow como la que esta en el reino de Davy Jones y   pone un huevo  o se acerca a una cabra  ,,,,,,|`|3XVQtZfHaa	spiderman 3|`|868e9fd81d9bef323fa730b49aeb4543aa	yo aun no he visto piratas del caribe, pero por ahora y mas que seguro prefiero spiderman 3, me encanta la trilogia de spiderman muy buena.|`|DoVc3apoaa	mira a mi me gusto piratas del caribe 3 por k  la accion fue mejor osea k a mi me gusto la accion|`|Gwq11MLzaa	spiderman 3, la otra ni siquiera la he visto jajaja y no me dan ganas de verla no me llama mucho la atencion.|`|NQclQbl0aa	LOS PIRATAS DEL CARIBE, HAY COMO MAS SUSPENSO Y APARTE DE TODO EL FINAL ES LO MAS CALIDAD QUE HAY YO DECIDO LOS PIRATAS DEL CARIBE 3|`|OS4Fvh1Jaa	a mi me encanto piratas del caribe 3..<br>  me encantaron las tres películas... <br>  la otra no me gusto porque cuando las vi las dos primeras me dormi en la mesa y no las termine de ver.. me parecieron muy plomas por lo largas y la trama que no me gustó en absoluto..<br>  es mi opinión, y por eso no me arriesgo a ver la tercera tampoco.<br>  pero Piratas del Caribe me gustó la trama desde el principio de la primera película hasta el final de la tercera. Me gustaron los personajes y la cosa cómica que mezcla con la "acción" o aventura de una película de piratas.<br>  me parecieron un completo embole las dospelículas de Spiderman, y tampoco me llama la atención una película de una historia que es siempre la misma a través del tiempo..<br>  me gustan mas las cosas nuevas, las nuevas ideas, las nuevas tramas, los nuevos personajes, por eso no quiero ver algo que lo repiten siempre pero con otros efectos, pero que al final acaba siendo lo mismo: un tipito colgado de todas las paredes de la ciudad tratando de acabar con un villano que jamás cambia ni de nombre.<br>  <br>  en resumes: Piratas del Caribe 3 es muchisimo mejor que la otra. Sin ofender, pero me parece una porquería Spiderman.|`|c687e5d25b0b28b5dc2b451e5a8cbcb3aa	Spiderman<br>  Spiderman<br>  emm<br>  Spiderman<br>  <br>  no solo porque la pelicula estubo muy muy buena, sino tambien porque eso de piratas del caribe me parece un bolazo, no me gusta|`|jFp7LNnUaa	Esta muy dificil... las dos duran bastante tiempo como la de Piratas del Caribe en el Fin del Mundo que dura tres largas y completas horas... las dos tienen unos efectos especiales muy reales y definitivos...

Primero fueron marinos auspiciados por Inglaterra para fregar a los espa?oles y despues se salieron de control....  En la película tomaron tantos datos historicos y lo mezclaron tan bien con la ficción y la fantasía..... tomaron leyendas aztecas, y mayas, leyendas europeas y escribieron una historia mitad verdad y mitad ficción.....<br>  <br>  SALUDOS!!!!!!!!!!|`|7a4d9ffed42006aabccbcbe53dd3181eaa	Esta pregunta se hace como diez  mil vecez al dia,?que no lo pueden preguntar en la calle?pero bueno,me gusto mas spiderman?feliz?|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No he visto ninguna, upsss!!!|`|ST45mH21aa	PIRATAS DEL CARIBE 3.<br>  <br>   BUENO APARTE DE SUS ACTORES, ME GUSTA POR QUE ES UNA PELICULA LLENA DE ACCION,AVENTURA Y FANTASIA,SUS EFECTOS ESPECIALES,LA TRAMA ETC ...|`|1313c11bf18e64f6bdbdbddb98abd8e3aa	Piratas del Caribe!!!!!!!!!

DnF4WJLiaa	I would like to think so. I have done research on this myself and have not come up with any definitive answers. The series now has such a rabid following, the producers would be insane not to continue on a bit more. However, that could be a downside as it could take a turn like InuYasha and become repetitive and ofttimes boring. In Japan we are on episode 137, with more coming our way!|`|QZtRVdRtaa	I would guess so, the manga and anime are really popular in Japan, so as long as people want to see it and keep ratings up the anime will keep being made|`|R9P5jcBaaa	yeah as per manga still at least one season left...<br>  It all depends on the producers though

Y7UjMzpdaa	uuuuta, pues mira que yo me  acuerde<br>  <br>  Stark ha cambiado de modelo de armadura cual si fueran automoviles o consolas de videojuegos, ha tenido la clásica que parecía boilers armados, la dorada con rojo con mascara como de piquitos, las mas modernas que han ido cambiando constantemente en su dise?o, armaduras para el espacio, para los profundidaes,  para pelear con Hulk, etc.<br>  <br>  Ademas ha habido varios portadores de la armadura. En el universo 616 obviamente el primero en usarla fue Stark, luego se la dejo un rato a Jim Rhodes ( quien luego tomaria otra armadura para convertirse en War Machine), despues hubo un tiempo en que un Stark adolescente traido del pasado se convierte en Iron man por un tiempo ( si; suena extra?o, no preguntes, jeje). Wolverine alguna vez la uso durante Civil War.<br>  <br>  Ademas esta la version Ultimate de Iron man, que tiene a mi parecer la aramdura mas fregona de todas,<br>  Sumale tambien los universos de las series animadas, la cinta de live action que viene, la animacion directa a DVD, los videojuegos que tambien tienen armaduras un poco diferentes. La lista es enorme.|`|857f77665c35c52c26e22ebeb8db79e1aa	la primera  armadura  que hizo  tony  stark  era    enorme  y pesada.<br>  depsues    hubo   un portador d ela  armadura  que no fue  stark<br>  y  la   version moderna  que es la  que sale  en  civil  war.<br>  hay otra  version   de  armadura  gris   llamada  war  machine|`|1pSjluFCaa	son dos versiones.<br>  1) John<br>  2)Tony Stark|`|6cccobMIaa	la del comic regular, la de los ultimates la de la animación(inanimada por cierto) ya la de la película hasta donde yo se además de que hubo un tiempo en que otro tipo estubo bajo la armadura.|`|ZFna7d1Qaa	q yo sepa son 2|`|mNeHy4TPaa	Muchas.

yOitB9Mjaa	El bien y el mal aunque se sepa qué son, son relativos.<br>  Depende de muchos factores, entre ellos el cultural por decir un ejemplo.

RzbRRUOdaa	You can publish through traditional publishers with the assistance of a literary agent for your manuscript to get reviewed.  When accepted, you will be paid for the rights and the house will publish your poetry book according to how they want it packaged.  If you get rejected, you can move to another traditional house and go through the review process again.  This takes time: months or even years.<br>  <br>  Another way to get published is through self-publishing.  Most of the writers these days do this because it's faster and you have full control of your book from cover to cover.<br>  <br>  Below is a site that will give you more information on the whole self-publishing process:<br>  <a href="http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you find this information helpful.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	A libary.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	I believe you first need to find an editor to look over the book<br>  You probably need representation(agent) to get your work to the right people.<br>  A letter to the publisher describing the book and why it should be published.<br>  Do a search on Yahoo or Google to look into the process.<br>  Good luck!|`|dqeOMqyPaa	library|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	go to a publisher.IDK where to find one look it up.|`|CKquZ8VWaa	wgewg|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>   The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start. It is best if you send in the entire manuscript and should not worry about protection because publishers have an agreement to not use your material without your consent.<br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>  Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their book’s top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.<br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>   <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>   <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|rl4NU9Zdaa	It depends where you live.<br>  <br>  Depeding Canda, US, other country.<br>  <br>  Then you can just google to see. <br>  <br>  THere are many places/companies that will help you.|`|qUGVYNItaa	home

7PS3fSSPaa	for the aries and aries relationship that would be a 50 50 chance but it would either last or finish real quick so its worth the risk. Im an aries so i know that we are full of pride very stubborn and never back down from a fight or competition. This can either make an aries couple very compatible or just drive each other crazy with their ego's. But their sex life will always be good. Well known fact that aries have very high sex drives.<br>  <br>  Aries and gemini would be good because gemini is a very understanding and sensitive person of which aries needs becasue we are always busy and very enthusiastic. They also have just the right amount of love to make this relationship perfect or a match made in heaven. The relationship will always be full of laughs and very few arguments. It will also contain lots of love. <br>  <br>  A sagittarius and aries is ok but i they are both very competetive people and equally stubborn which would make this relationship more interesting. In my opinion a sagittarus and an aries should be a fling because this type of relationship can lead to alot of fights. They are equal eggoed to be right, and the best.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Definately<br>  <br>  Great sex, great emotional understanding. Very strong|`|jOyJRsz2aa	very nice.

Trolls usually get their accounts suspended or deleted before the person ever reaches that level.  Some say that there was a dude that made it to that level back in the late 90's by the name of Timmy J. Stinkleton.  Stinkleton was supposedly this ace answerer that no one could deny awarding best answer to time and time again.  Supposedly, Stinkleton received so many points on here that the government began to get suspicious.  The government supposedly hired a vicious Russian troll to report Stinkleton's answers and questions 24/7 until Stinkleton's account was deleted and he was banned from Yahoo permanently.  Due to the stress of losing his account and all of his accumulated points, Stinkleton supposedly committed suicide by bungee jumping off the Empire State building without the bungee cord.  It may just be an urban legend.  It's hard to tell because the government buried the story so deep that even the Freedom of Information Act couldn't gain one access to the documents associated with this case.|`|T8OVFYrdaa	omg... it's YOU<br>  <br>  <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/profile-.5oPUN0jRKzkt45BBcw0">http://360.yahoo.com/profile-.5oPUN0jRKz...</a>|`|N1JFX1yGaa	The Judas guy in this section i don't know him but that's what comes to my mind.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Judas Rabbi|`|ch04T8YRaa	Tigger|`|f4iszDZuaa	Judas Rabbi.......|`|d5COR2S2aa	lemme check<br>  <br>  nope, i don't have anyone in level 7 in my contacts/fans. a couple of level 5s and 1 level 6 tho....|`|LmARYQxcaa	I know many level 7's and I would never send you their links.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	I've seen some people in level 7 but I forgot there names. :(|`|5d35f02795f13416394a1ca500f68647aa	Nope sorry, I'm just a level 5<br>  <br>  :)|`|0eArONZraa	no and why??|`|90MSfEGSaa	no|`|AyC8TJyfaa	nope|`|hYsMzqMxaa	no... but thnx for the points!!|`|hWSzVMZMaa	Yes, and I'm almost there...just 11,223 points away.|`|pXkWoqKjaa	let me check real quick and i'll get back to you...<br>  i just need to get the links...|`|WwniGb7vaa	Vancouver, B.

LIyqb5Rwaa	Those "in the know", know how good he is.  <br>  <br>  His spot in ABB will gurantee a steady income for years to come, which will afford him to record and tour with The Derek Trucks Bands and do what ever other projects he wishes to, and make a good living.<br>  <br>  As far as him going mainstream?  You mean a Top 40 hit?  Not in this day and age.  <br>  <br>  For one, he doesn't really sing.  <br>  <br>  Two ; his style of music just isn't on the radar for commercially viable fare.  In other words, the young set, the driving force behind Top 40, just isn't into blues based rock music nowadays<br>  <br>  But you never know, maybe he and his band will craft an album that is so good, and so universally hailed, that it will usher in a new interest in his kind of music, that will be copied and imitated by others, ala Nirvana, or Van Halen.<br>  <br>  But most likeley he'll go down as a great Bluesman, born 30 years too late.|`|TZMJTtnkaa	derek trucks is the man. i saw him and the band a few months ago and it was amazing. hes definitely one of the best guitarists of his generation, but i dont know how much of an impact hes gonna have.  he hasn't really busted down any doors yet, but hes got a lot of years ahead of him. <br>  and the new album, already free, is a great step in the right direction|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i think his legacy is being one of the people who really created the modern jam band show trading scene, which has grown very large in the last few years. If the rock and roll hall of fame doesnt want to acknowledge him for that effort, as well as being absolutely incredible on the guitar, than it is their own loss. It makes me wonder if the section on the allman brothers, who are already in the hall, includes anything about him or not.<br>  <br>  As far as going mainstream- why would he? he doesnt need the money, he makes plenty from touring. he has complete artistic freedom at this point- why would he give that up? I imagine he will stay out touring and releasing the occasional album until he dies because he seems to genuinely love doing that.

yq1WSp8naa	When BadBeast "overdoes it" a bit, his "condition" seems to become infectious, and while (as in this case,) it usually results in nothing more than a few of his less principled contacts encouraging him to make an entertaining spectacle, it's not very apparent to those unused to what passes for a sense of humour here, and to them, it must seem like the rantings and wibblings of some deranged, insane cadre of tripped out members of some "Manson Family" style of Lunatics. His insane seeming choice of phrase, often conceals some arcane, hidden meaning, who's relevance can be known, only to those who fully abandon their powers of reasoning, Hence the confusion. <br>  It never lasts for long, anyway.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	p??u ??????

ugNH8FMYaa	I'm only 32 but my great grandparents grew up then & before they passed I was told stories.<br>  <br>  Great Grandma was born in 1913 - she was married in 1933. Her mother past when she was 18('31), leaving her with her surviving father, 1 older brother & 3 younger siblings. She worked as a waitress to keep bread on the table. <br>  <br>  As an elderly woman I personally witnessed her eating a popular depression snack (per my grandma, her daughter) - Saltines w/ milk. It was a cheap meal. Also she has pantry after pantry FILLED to the brim w/ canned food. "Just in case". After living in poverty she made sure she'd never go hungry again. After she passed we found canned food 10 yrs old!!!<br>  <br>  My great grandpa passed in '75 - he had to quit school at 13 to help his family of 7 pick cotton. This was in OK. After the Dust Bowl hit they hight tailed it to AZ where they continued to pick cotton & lay down their roots. Our family now has 4 generations of native Arizonans.<br>  <br>  From what *I* saw personally - it made people very conscious of how they saved & what they spent. Foil was saved. Canned food was saved. Nothing went to waste.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped some.<br>  <br>  EDITED to add - the 20's had the flappers who were busy being rebellious at the Speak Easy's.....due to alcohol prohibition. Alcohol was prohibited until 1933. Starting in 1920. So there are a few facts that run the two (20s vs 30s) together.  The 20's I see as a rebellion for everyone - jazz era began, hemlines raised, women started shaving, cars got faster. THe 30's everyone was coasting back to a simpler time & necessity driven atmosphere. Rebellion slowed down bc suddenly fun wasn't as important as survival.<br>  <br>  History has said that war helps recession (except currently) - once WWII began things looked brighter. We moved beyond what pained us (depression) & took care of what was important (our country).<br>  <br>  Sorry if I got off track. ;)|`|dFEjpmcuaa	The roaring 20s and the basic time period of the Great Depression were about 10 years apart so they would either be a child during the roaring 20s or an adult during the depression.

If so, invite them to come up to the front, and perhaps give a short demonstration of their ability on their respective instrument.<br>  <br>       The point is, to engage them; rather than the above, you might ask if any of them are familiar with the Kreisler or any compositions for the violin and/or the piano.<br>  <br>       Or, you might just give a very(VERY)short lecture on the piece, and the duo involved; and/or ask them what pieces of classical music they're familiar with.<br>  <br>       On this forum, there are/have been countless questions asked about Beethoven's "Fur Elise" and "Moonlight Sonata".  Before playing the P & A, you might play an arrangement - or portion thereof - one of these two pieces.<br>  <br>       Maybe in some way relate to Bella's Lullaby, or Yurina(sp.-?)another two often referred to pieces and artists; to try and establish some kind of interest/emotional tie with them, I think is the best way to go: no gathering, group, especially of students, like to feel they're being compelled to sit there, and not participate in some way.<br>  <br>                                                  Good luck,<br>  <br>                                                          Alberich|`|rNqF4gIVaa	What piece... the Praeludium and Allegro of what?|`|OZ6Kb6mgaa	convince them it's not uncool... it depends on the school, i guess. i really like classical music and i'm a normal teenager, got lots of friends, i don't get judged for it. :P it's just a question of tastes. if some don't like it, don't force them to. first off for them to like it and enjoy it they have to know it's not wrong to.|`|rm3j0Hdcaa	It might be cool if you were to turn off the lights, and tell them that they can close their eyes, then start playing.

(=|`|QpdGD6ikaa	Personally, I think they were meant to have a father/daughter relationship kind of thing, given the fact that Sesshomaru hates humans and his father for having Inuyasha with a human. It was probably a way to show that Sesshomaru does have a soft spot, and it was for Rin, despite her being human. As for them being a couple, well, let's just keep that in the fanfictions shall we? I love Sesshomaru and I think that he'll look good with anyone, whether it be Kagura or Rin, though. So, hey! Let them be together if people wnat them to be together, I guess.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I agree, to an extent. Once Rin grows up I think they'd be cute together, since Sesshoumaru never ages.|`|olumGCQtaa	yea that is kind a sick. i like them as brother and sister|`|SY2dabbzaa	exactly that would be good

kAvgkLxPaa	Beethoven probably used more sforzandos than any other composer of his period. He was also considered one of the first pioneers of Romanticism in music in the ways he wrote his later works.<br>  <br>  If you mean the 9th symphony (that's where the Ode to Joy theme was taken from), it was the very first time that voices had been incorporated into a symphony. Prior to that, nobody did it. Yes he was deaf when he wrote it, but that isn't the main reason why it's so famous.<br>  <br>  The first movement of his 9th symphony can be considered 'free form'. Beethoven wasn't writing it according to traditional sonata or symphonic forms. That was what made it so different. He also didn't care for pretty melodies in the opening of the 1st movement. In fact, the very opening section is often called a 'horror fanfare' because it shocked audiences so much when it was first performed in Beethoven's days. If you were to compare it to the Mozart or Haydn symphonies before that, you'll see what a huge difference it was.<br>  <br>  The fourth movement is where the Ode to Joy theme is from. As I've already mentioned, nobody before Beethoven had put voices into a symphony, let alone a whole chorus complete with soloists. The cellos imitate a recitative (that's a term used in opera to refer to the speech-like singing in between arias), and the recitative melody is then taken up by a male soloist singing it. The theme (Ode to Joy) is then sung by the full chorus.<br>  <br>  Now for something completely unrelated to your question. I'm sure the chorus sopranos of Beethoven's time AND today - want to kill him for writing the crazy soprano part in the symphony. It's horrendously high in terms of where the melody sits. No one in their right mind would ask chorus sopranos to hit high A's and B's repeatedly, with such a loud dynamic level. Makes one wonder what was going through his mind when he wrote it. Hmmm...|`|CrAwmz65aa	Similar questions come in from time to time, so I keep a file on the subject.<br>  Here are some ideas which Beethoven borrowed from Mozart:<br>  <br>  >>>>>If the first movement of a composition in sonata form was in a minor key, Mozart often wrote the last movement in the parallel major. An example is the e minor violin sonata, K 304.  Beethoven did likewise in the g minor piano sonata, op. 49 no. 1 and in his Fifth Symphony.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In the F major sonata, K 280, Mozart wrote all the movements in sonata form, not just the first movement.  Beethoven did the same thing in "The Tempest" Sonata.<br>  Mendelssohn did the same thing in the Scotch Symphony.<br>  <br>  >>>>>The Mozart c minor sonata, K 457, is believed to have inspired Beethoven's "Little Pathetique" Sonata, op. 10 no. 1, and his "Pathetique" Sonata, op. 13, both in the same key.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In the A major sonata, K 331, Mozart wrote a theme and variations in place of the usual sonata movement.  Beethoven did the same thing in his Ab major sonata, op. 26.  <br>  <br>  >>>>>In the Bb major sonata, K 570, Mozart wrote two themes in the first movement which were similar to each other.  Beethoven did the same thing in the Appassionata sonata.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In many of his sonatas, (C major sonata, K 279, a minor sonata, K 310, C major sonata, K 330), Mozart wrote more than two themes in the first movement.  Beethoven followed suit in his symphonies.<br>  <br>  >>>>>It seems that both composers regarded the subdominant as a way of saying goodby. Both composers emphasize the subdominant in the coda. <br>  <br>  In the C major sonata, K 279, second movement, Mozart emphasizes the subdominant chord with a secondary dominant in ms. 70-71. He does the same thing in the F major sonata, third movement, ms. 178-180. In the second movement of the C major sonata, K 545, we see a rarity in ms. 65-66: a secondary subdominant.<br>  <br>  In the second movement of the G major sonata, op. 49 no. 2, Beethoven emphasizes the subdominant with a secondary dominant in ms. 108-109.<br>  <br>  >>>>>Take a look at the slow movement of the Mozart Sonata Facile, K 545. and that of the Beethoven "Pathetique" Sonata, op. 13. In both movements, all of the cadences are feminine cadences (dissonance on the strong beat, resolution on the weak beat) until the end of the last statement of the main theme. At this point, we hear the first masculine cadence (dissonance on the weak beat, resolution on the strong beat). This is ms. 63-64 in Mozart and ms. 65-66 in Beethoven. In both movements, the composer apologizes by giving us masculine cadences galore in the coda.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In the d minor piano concerto, Mozart injects an extra solo theme at the beginning of the solo exposition.  Beethoven does likewise in his violin concerto.<br>  <br>  >>>>>Mozart could almost beat the Romantic composers at their own game.  Listen to the slow movement from his A major piano concerto, K488, and that from his Symphonie Concertante for violin and viola, K 364, and you will see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Beethoven has also been noted for the schmaltzy slow movement in his Ninth Symphony.<br>  <br>  And here are some ideas which Beethoven came up with all on his own:<br>  <br>  >>>>>In his fourth and fifth piano concerti, Beethoven sought freedom from the custom of beginning the first movement with an orchestral introduction.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In the Emperor Concerto, we hear the second theme first in the minor mode, then in the relative major.  In the violin concerto, we hear the second theme first in major mode, then in the parallel minor.<br>  <br>  In the A major cello sonata, we hear the first theme first in the major mode, then a variation of that theme in the parallel minor.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In his Waldstein and Appassionata Sonatas, Beethoven leads directly from the second movement to the third movement.  Likewise for the Emperor Concerto and the violin concerto.<br>  <br>  This is not altogether new, since Handel sometimes ended a movement with a dissonance to be resolved in the following movement.  However, Beethoven was the first composer in the Classical Era to do this.<br>  <br>  >>>>>The first movement of the third piano concerto is in c minor.  The second movement is in E major instead of the expected Eb major.  Since E is the third tone of the C major scale whereas Eb is the third tone of the c minor scale, this provides greater relief from the minor modality.<br>  <br>  Brahms follows Beethoven's example in his first symphony.<br>  <br>  Beethoven makes a similar choice in the Emperor Concerto, in which the first movement is in Eb major and the second movement is in B major.<br>  <br>  >>>>>In a sense, Beethoven forebode rock-and-roll music 200 years early. In many of his piano sonatas, he contrasts a less smooth first theme with a steady and legato second theme. In the first movement of the f minor sonata, op. 2 no. 1, the second theme starts at ms. 20. In the first movement of the A major sonata, op. 2 no. 2, the second theme starts at ms. 59. In the fourth movement of the C major sonata, op. 2 no. 3, the second theme starts at ms. 30. In the first movement of the "Little Pathetique" Sonata, op. 10 no. 1, the second theme starts at ms. 56. In the first movement of the D major sonata, op. 10 no. 3, the second theme starts at ms. 23. In the first movement of the "Pastorale" sonata in D major, op. 28, the second theme starts at ms. 76. In the first movement of the g minor sonata, op. 49 no. 1, the second theme starts at ms. 16. In the second movement of the same sonata, the second theme starts at ms. 20. <br>  <br>  In the "Love Boat" series, the signature theme, with its steady legato accompaniment, begins when the ship leaves the port.<br>  <br>  The Queen hit song "We are the Champions" follows Beethoven's example, with the stanza replacing the first theme and the refrain replacing the second theme.  <br>  The Beatles also followed Beethoven's example.  Listen to "When I'm 64" and "Girl."<br>  <br>  >>>>>Beethoven seems to have invented the idea of introducing a figure which is continued in the harmony or counterpoint of the restatement of the main theme. In the second movement of the "Pathetique" Sonata, triplets are introduced in the C theme at ms. 37. A first-time listener would expect him to discontinue these triplets in time for the restatement, but instead, they continue in ms. 51. <br>  <br>  The Romantic composers copied this neat little trick.  Witness the recapitulation in the Mendelssohn violin concerto, the slow movement of the Tchaikovsky piano concerto, and the slow movement of the Franck d minor symphony.<br>  <br>  >>>>>Beethoven also worked a similar trick.  Here, the preceding section, instead of contributing an accompanying figure, adapts in order to fit with the main theme.  In the second movement of the G major sonata, op. 49 no. 2, the second theme ends on dotted rhythms in ms. 42-47.  These fit with the dotted rhythms of the main theme in ms. 48.<br>  <br>  The sneaky restatement in Fur Elise is even more ingenious. The opening theme begins with a minor second toggle. The third theme ends with a descending chromatic scale in ms. 83-84. This fits like a glove with the restatement on ms. 85. I wonder which element he thought of first, the chromatic scale or the minor second toggle.|`|qswrz268aa	Beethoven ushered in the romantic period, buy using more unconventional composing methods. For example he wrote sonatas that were two movements. <br>  <br>  Another thing that distinguished him, was perhaps that he wrote music more for the expression than intellectuality. Music with more passion, than ingenious structure (of course he combined the two).<br>  <br>  Ode to joy? You mean symphony 9? It was probably so famous because he was deaf when he wrote it and premiered it. Have you ever wrote a symphony when you were deaf? But just like all songs that are famous... They're stupendous. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped somewhat. Of course everybody has different opinions on this subject... <br>  <br>  Well Good luck on that essay...

xs4U12iIaa	It Really Depends On If One Life To Lives Directors Want To Change Todd. That Would Be Interesting If It Ever Did Happen,And To See If It Would Be Accepted By The Fans Or If It Can Be Believable !|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	I've watched OLTL for decades, and I don't know if Todd's character would be very interesting if he were a decent human being. He's not likable at all, if he were a real person. I think if they writers wanted to "fix" him, they'd need to have some life-altering event happen. And life-altering on a soap has to be pretty extreme.|`|AA11362302	I agree,it would be too convenient. <br>   I guess with the latest victim being<br>  Marty(again) alot of people feel he isn`t worth saving or "fixing".

They've tried to make him nicer and more normal from time to time, but he's much more interesting the way he is.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	That would be one way to do it but I think they have overdone the DID story line. One person was enough. Now we have Jess, we don't need another. I am really surprised Todd hasn't tried to pull that again!|`|KqQlWbYsaa	It's a bit too convenient, however, after all it's not solely or purerly for entertainment value that Jess turned out to have the same disorder that her mother suffers from.<br>  <br>  The other thing I want to point out is that Blair has at times tried to explain Todd's behavior by stressing a lot of it has to do with all of the guilt he has as to what he did to Marty.  What you don't understand is that sometimes evil exists within individuals; and it cannot always be suppressed, at least not completrely.|`|AA12390047	Todd isn't worth "fixing".  He had good things going for him as an adult and he screwed up each time.  Viki's brother or not, he's not worth it and I think Blair is well rid of him too.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	I think that would be way too convenient.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	It does make sense BUT I don't think they should give yet another person D.I.D.

2vzj65Kfaa	Would be too much to type in a box here.<br>  <br>  In VERY brief - <br>  The music was developing among rural African American in the second half of the 19th century.  The 'blues' sound is said to have developed from the slaves natural proclivity to flatten the 3rd and 7th notes of the scale and singing in a 'call and response' style.<br>  <br>  In 1914 (I think that's the date, but someone more knowledgable will correct me!) W.C. Handy published what is believed to be the first "blues" sheet music for his song "Memphis Blues".  He later said that he heard the sound of it years earlier at a train station where an itinerate musician was playing guitar with a bottleneck slide.<br>  <br>  In 1920 Mephis Minnie recorded the first "blues" recording with her "Crazy Blues".  This started a craze in the recording industry.  At the time, the recording industry was in competition with the new format of radio and were willing to try more broad music than just classical and jazz.  Most of the first blues stars were female singers - often with a strong vaudeville background.  Because of the open attitude of the recording industry and the field research of people like the Lomaxes, they quickly went on to record a number of blues artists both male and female from around the rural south.<br>  <br>  This should be a good begining for your research, also look into how the depression affected the migrations of people, WWII, and the return of the soldiers, the changes in the styles of music in the post WWII era, etc, etc, etc,|`|aQcsrgLCaa	It began a long long time ago, (possibly in a galaxy far, far away) and is just as strong and vibrant today as it ever was.<br>  <br>  It has evolved constantly and has used modern technology as it has become available. For example, electric instruments, recording, internet etc.<br>  <br>  It is now played and enjoyed by people from all walks of life and all ages and probably began (as we would recognise it) in the south of a place called America and reputedly the Mississippi delta where it is said that it began with the answer and call of work songs.<br>  <br>  Robert Johnson was born in the Mississippi area. He lived in the Robinsonville area and he was said to be a poor guitarist. He moved away for a time and when he came back he was said to be a really good performer. The legend is that he sold his soul to the devil in return for his talent. He probably practised a lot and learnt things from other guitarists in different areas and then put all his new tricks together. He died in 1938 at the age of 27. He might have been shot, some say stabbed and others say poisoned. No one knows where he is buried. He recorded 39 tracks and there are (I think,) 2 or 3 photographs of him.<br>  <br>  The song that he is probably the most famous for is Cross Roads blues, but his best song is possibly Me and the Devil Blues.|`|JafMj9LVaa	try looking on Wikipedia.

QGv8ngfeaa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  Case in Point: Taylor Swift, Black Eyed Peas<br>  <br>  Recording Studios are magical. They can make anyone sound good.|`|z3b1DzlXaa	If the record company thinks they can sell it, then very likely you can get them to sign you.  How much you get depends entirely on how much they'll pay.<br>  If you genuinely think it's good enough to sell, give it a shot.  I don't know if they hire people to write songs for singers already signed to them, but I imagine it happens.|`|RghQn7SWaa	Yes, even an average singer can sound amazingly good in a recording studio. With a good engineer and some effects and studio trickery, you may not even recognize your own voice once it's all mixed down. Don't shop a sub-par demo, redo it until it's perfect because you may not get that opportunity again. Also, watch American Idol for some great tips. The judges actually give great honest feedback for those that will listen.<br>  <br>  For the 2nd part, yes, you can go the songwriter route and let someone else record your songs if you decide singing is not your thing. You can still make a lot of money, but if you want to sing, go for it!|`|IOQ0zIFlaa	There is a chance that you could get signed regardless of being average or AMAZING.  It just depends.  If you ever went into an audition type thing to get signed, just sell yourself.  Have tons of confidence and have lotssss of emotion with the songs.  They like that stuff.<br>  <br>  And yes, they could possibly say that they just want you as a writer.  There are tons of "behind the scenes" song writers for people so that could definitely happen if the lyrics were good enough, which I'm sure they are.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it!  :)|`|AA11955503	You don't need to have a powerful voice to be a great singer. Every singer is unique in his/her own way. I think you belong in the "singer-songwriter" path like me. A lot of artists write their own songs these days. You have an advantage, since you work on your own original material. <br>  <br>  Usually, if you do both singing and songwriting, when you get a deal, they'll let you record & perform your own songs (but I heard a major label would still have a certain degree of control over you- so look both ways). It doesn't always have to be a major record label.

AA12390047	I don't think Annie is leaving.  She and Aidan are getting closer.  But she killed Richie, Di, and setup the kidnapping of Emma.  She must have a good attorney to get her off.  I'm glad Dr. Sinclair is out.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	No, I don't think Annie's leaving. I think since everyone knew Sinclair's story already they had her confess so they could move her along. She really doesn't have any story line left.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	No, Annie isn't leaving, she and Aidan should be getting together. They only asked the actress playing Dr.Sinclair on for a limited time so they had to move fast. I don't think she caught on with viewers very well either.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	I don't think she's leaving. I think some how she and Ryan will get back together some time down the road, or else they're gonna put her with Adian and they have never kept him matched up yet since he's been on the show. There's gonna be alot stuff going on. There's gonna be stuff with Zack and Kendall and Ryan, David is gonna do some terrible things. Crystal is gonna get put by the wayside and she should after leaving Tad. There's gonna be stuff with Reese, Bianca is leaving the show.  There's gonna be a mess and they say Dixie is coming back, whatever, which is fine, but how they do this is beyond me.  Yes, they drag everything out and then it all goes down at the same time.|`|XnYkROf3aa	but that's what i love about amc. they don't drag it out as long as others do. which drives me insane. and no i don't think Annie's leaving. i remember reading about her in a soap mag. and they said that they have lots of plans for annie. i think that her and adin are gonna end up together. shes starting to fall for him. and i think he is starting to like her to.|`|AA11451041	I think Dr Sinclair and Ryan should run off together!|`|OpRi517waa	I hope Annie isn't leaving she is one of my favorites and her playing a crazy keeps me tuned in she's very believable kind of makes you wonder about her real life mental stasis huh....I think Annie is just going to end up with her savor Aidan and they are going to get rid of the Shrink played by the god-awful McKenzie Westmore to me she is just the worst actress and I can't stand her.I for one will not shed a tear if they can her butt.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	I think the writers just want to make things right for Annie after so long making her out to be a killer. She may or may not leave. But if she leaves, it will not be without her daughter. She needs to get well first. Personally, I would like to see her stick around for a while.

fGFCt4CSaa	it should be over b/c he isnt a good guy and those love songs wont ever seem so sweet anymore. But because he is famous,  in a few years he will make a comeback and say some crap like he was young and stupid. He will pretend to turn to religion(like all guilty entertainers do) and stupid people will buy it.  <br>  He'll never be as big as he could have been however, which is too bad cuz he put out so much good music and now we wont get anymore with such great quality.   On the other hand, Rihanna career will propel to even greater heights as she will be seen as a symbol for strong woman that overcame difficult situations. Even if she bombs at something she will still be comended by her new legion of fans|`|R1oLN5wGaa	i think its not.though he did that still there are some people that would be on his side.im not saying this because i like him and his songs.im saying this because that's what would turned out.after rihanna's bruised healled ofcourse issue will subside as well.people might get mad at him but obviously not all.if you all still can remember artist that were getting into some horrifying issues.they're careers is still on the go.right?|`|oRfzWncyaa	its not over. <br>  just damaged. Very badly.<br>  <br>  he will have proabley lost alot of fans.<br>  but it will be about how he recovers from this. <br>  you know going to anger managment and other stuff like that.|`|rYGUloyKaa	his career is over because he hit such a big female celebrity rihanna. if he hit a random girl it wud be different, but since rihanna has so many fans he's a dead man. chris is a b*tch|`|Pft3jKFkaa	His career is definately over. I personally don't even respect him anymore|`|S8obYhFyaa	I dont know. I know a lot of friends who don't support him anymore, though.|`|3ZbVHhG9aa	he will recover. celebrities have survived much worse scandals.|`|YrO4fESyaa	well it depends on what happens with him and rihanna..but i think it wont neccesarily|`|Lasx21sbaa	i definitly think that he's going to lay low for a long time but drama always sells so i think his cds will boost.|`|KLpN10Icaa	itll never reach the same heights but its not over  hell mickey rourke made a comeback|`|IFXAlv7Uaa	naw, once a pimp dawg, always a pimp dawg|`|uxU5lOLYaa	No.  Even Michael Jackson still gets offers.|`|IMwLfHQvaa	his anger just took a toll on him.<br>  The girl could have gave him HERPES.|`|WU6Ytstgaa	no. he's very talented|`|QmSIsUZvaa	yeah i definitley think it is condsidering how badly banged up she is. its too bad, he could have been really great.|`|JOgWK1Yeaa	Lil Wayne and T.I. are okay so why would he not be?|`|2EE9L1Q7aa	If Chris Brown career is over there should be plenty of celebs who are way older then him who career should be over. From gun/ drug possessions to statutory rape. <br>  <br>  I'm not on nether side cuz I have sympathy for both because they are young and still learning. But I do feel more sorry for CB cuz it seem they trying to lynch the brother. He apologize for what he did and still ppl is out for his head. It's men out there who beat their wife's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the husband find nothing wrong with it. Where is the outcry for them. If ppl didn't know Rihanna and Chris Brown none of these ppl would even care.|`|BVWgzX0eaa	yeah i do think his career is down hill. he freaken broke her jaw. what do you expect. i like knew that this was going to happen again. this isn't  the first time he's done it. i don't even think that he should be able to buy his way out of this little mess up. totalyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|kj2K1UFpaa	to be honest and all of people might not like what i have to say but i really don't think it was that bad she has a bust lip and you mouth can bust very easy.. and a few sracthes nothing really life threatening..she wasn't abusing they were fight and anyone can tell people are making such a big deal because he has a american boy image and a good boy image..i seen abused women and they look way worse then this..it is sad that it has to happen to someone famous for someone to get mad..if all they people who are bashing chris should look at themselves first.he is only 19 he hasn't mature yet at all if you haven't done nothing immature or stupid between the age of 18-25 please let me know because you are GOD!!|`|zA61EsTuaa	well alot of celebrities are doing something that they should do like R. Kelly T.I. or even Michael Jackson but that hasn't stopped me from listening to them because really its none of our business what they do in there personal life and they have talent. but that was mess up what he has done i lost respect for Chris Brown but i will still listen to his music.|`|G4kBitxEaa	Probably not. Celebreties have had worse stuff, but then they come with this "I have a sickness" then they go to rehab. Then WOOHOO comeback. and some remember others are just happy his "sickness" is cured by 'rehab'|`|8d42bfdda82b255679a249cc8e70cd53aa	Hopefully she has a lot of forgiveness|`|YhuH2k4Caa	chris brown's career is as good as sour milk...theres not alot of space in hollywood for woman beaters...|`|xvtev56jaa	No. He'll recover from this soon.

Then you have books and other print media like those scrolls at a store counter. These are just the tip.<br>  <br>  Other big things are t-shirts and jewelry. Zodiac symbols sell well. Each sign birthstones that help sell precious and semi-precious jewels. It is like having 12 different clubs and people want to belong to one of them. Or two when you add the Chinese type too.<br>  <br>  If astrology was not a good business, making hundreds of millions per year, no one would bother. Or another made up concept would take it"s place.|`|4MKpSJtDaa	wow, that's cool man.<br>  i guess because its fun.|`|awLQeRkMaa	people like to learn about themselves|`|tQW18Kspaa	What are your aspects when you do a <br>  Synastry Chart/Partner Chart?<br>  If a lot of aspects have Sextiles,Trines or are empty<br>  Maybe that's why.<br>  Her Mars you say is in Libra-a laid back sign-balances<br>  Your Venus is in Gemini-always keeping things lively and<br>  communicating(verbally,body language,sensing,Mentally)<br>  <br>  Let's see your Synastry Charts Done<br>  <br>  Need only<br>  Your Date of Birth<br>  Place of Birth<br>  Time of Birth (apparently you don't have hers)No Ascendant<br>  but can use 12noon<br>  No Names are needed

So, the main conflict would be when he is expected to behave as a human would when he is brought out of the jungle.<br>  Minor conflicts would be<br>  1.  How to assimilate human mating behavior to attract Ursula<br>  2.  Weather Ursula should follow her mothers wishes and marry Kyle or follow her heart and go for George.  Also, where should they live, her world or his?  Personally I like the way Brendon Fraser looks in a loin cloth!!! (Although he's not bad in an armani suit either!)
sjD26raeaa	No died in 2006 Tullis died November 11 due to injuries she received in an October 14 motorycle accident in Azusa, coroner's officials said.<br>  <a href="http://www.insidesocal.com/editors/2007/02/florence_rusty_tullis_finally.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidesocal.com/editors/2007/...</a><br>  <br>  Brian Day talked to the niece of the late Florence "Rusty" Tullis and she will be picking up the remains after the county cremates the body. It will happen in the next few weeks. One mystery in this story that may never be answered is why did it take the Beverly Hospital nearly two months to report Tullis' death to the coroner's office. A delay the coroner's office said was highly unusual. Hospital officials refused to answer the question citing a federal privacy law. Another sad component is that because of financial hardships, the family couldn't afford to cremate the body. A forum for, I guess, bikers has been trying to create some type of fundraiser. Something that won't be needed now for the cremation costs. It's sad that all the people who made money off Tullis' story couldn't throw money to aid the family. And at least Cher should have known about her death because we talked to her p.r. person in November.|`|SM66sORiaa	If your referring to Roy L.

She was thrown from the motorcycle after it struck a curb and her body hit a telephone pole.<br>  <br>   Ms. Tullis, who suffered two broken legs in the accident, was undergoing rehabilitation at a Montebello facility when she complained of having a stomach ache and was taken to the hospital.<br>  <br>  A onetime go-go dancer with a penchant for drugs and bikers, the flame-haired Ms. Tullis was an unlikely candidate for the limelight.<br>  <br>  Even she acknowledged that seeing the story of her and her son Rocky Dennis on the big screen was "a fairy tale," as she told People magazine after the movie featuring Eric Stoltz as a teenage Rocky hit theaters in 1985.

ZtnXNbaEaa	according to astrology capi and cancer can work very well... they are exactly opposite ... cancer is emotional and capi unemotional... but this is the reason why it works... capi's are not emotional but then they are very good at acknowledging someone's emotions... they are not careless.. if someone hurt or someone sad... they always have a very gentle caring hand... they care a lott about the one they love... and they are not manipulative nor fake... they are trustworthy and that just impress a cancer... since for cancertrust is very important in a relation.. and they are very well grounded and every earth sign can ground a over emotional over sentimental water sign... and capi are the coolest to say... they jus dont argue with you for silly things... they just go with the flow... and they are money minded and workoholic... they know value of money since they earn it outta lot of hardwork... and in my experience... i have dated a capricorn... and there was unknown compatibility... i must say i hurt him so many times... but he understand me very well... he finds the reason why i behaved like that... he was the best understanding BF i've ever had..|`|Z0odTlyQaa	Well I can say that Capricorn is not the BEST match for Cancer (based on my research I think it's a Taurus).

Each helps the other to fulfill an ambition, in realms that are perfectly complementary. The Saturnine personality benefits from Cancer's intuition, and the moonchild appreciates Capricorn's ability to achieve financial security. They take the time to love, understand, and cuddle each other. An ideal marriage: conventional, happy, and united for life.

5HvdcWvBaa	I was born in 1991!!! Hell YEAH!! XD<br>  <br>  I remember loving the Spice Girls too!! Hehe I did a project on them for school...when I was veeerrry little, like 5, I've gotta point out!!! :)|`|8039be540df1845420248ce48f6ca331aa	I didn't really like a band until I was about 12, and then it was the Beatles and Queen. <br>  <br>  I remember that my favorite song was Johnny B. Goode because of the movie Back to the Future. <br>  <br>  I remember that I always liked classical music, but again there aren't favorite bands in classical music, only favorite composers. Btw if you're curious, I liked classical music because I played the piano since the age of 6, so it kind of grew on me. <br>  <br>  Once again, I can't say that I really liked a band, I liked artists instead. My favorite popular artist growing up was Eminem.<br>  <br>  I just remembered, I used to crazy when "It's My Life" by Bon Jovi was played<br>  <br>  Forgot to mention that I grew up in the 90s.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	i liked bonjovi when i was in primary school, by 1992 i was about 12 and in highschool...  then it was pearl jam, smashing pumpkins, guns n roses, sabbath, frenzal rhomb, nofx...|`|ssoZ33XIaa	I was born in 1984, and my favorite band growing up was Backstreet Boys.  My favorite song was "All I Have to Give" by BSB.|`|6BhTjwoNaa	My favorite band when I was growing up in early 1970's was Grand Funk Railroad. Their hit "DOA" was awesome.I also loved Leon Russell,and Pink Floyds' Ummagamma.|`|k7jGZydJaa	AFI.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	i liked britney spears|`|Yc9uPziVaa	i liked ac/dc and def leppard when i was 8 lol|`|3ggolLgQaa	Hi, <br>  My favourite song of all time was "King of wishful thinking" by Go West and "They don't really care about us" by MJ<br>  <br>  Fav bands: <br>  I loved... <br>  <br>  Sclub 7<br>  Spice Girls<br>  Venga boys<br>  Nirvana<br>  Beatles<br>  Destiny's child<br>  and many others...<br>  <br>  I was born in 1989 but I now mostly listen to Jazz ( I love Miles Davis) and I listen to old school tunes mostly by Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Al Green, Etta James, Billie Holiday and such...<br>  <br>  Right now the song that is most played on my itunes is <br>  Try by Nelly Furtado. I find this song to be somewhat addictive<br>  <br>  Thanks :D|`|PDxQWnlraa	I grew up with a lot of Creed, and imo I still like their music today. Although, my favorite songs from back in the day were probably<br>  <br>  Numb/Encore - Jay Z/Linkin Park<br>  <br>  Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Green Day<br>  <br>  <br>  I now hate both those songs above me and listen to Progressive, Metal, and Rock|`|qnKRxzoIaa	Probably Rascal Flatts. I remember liking them from the very beginning, back in 1998-99, and for a long time my favorite song was by them (I'm Movin' On).

(Although I don't really get Eden's answer...)<br>  You know you're gonna go with Leos, no rival to that, also, I'm with you, Tril's great, first one to answer one of my questions and if it were for me he'd be my only contact, lol!<br>  Btw, I love your question for being so nice, it made my day, we need more like these!|`|Z0odTlyQaa	I've always been fascinated with Libras, my best friends and some boyfriends have been Libras. <br>  <br>  I was going to say Leos are typically very full of themselves and need constant ego stroking, but that is kind of obvious by the question you (a Leo) asked. :)|`|x8A2Ya8Haa	um leos theyre so confident it sometimes can get annoyin but its HOTT lol<br>  <br>  and sags are unique|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	Libras most definetly.|`|k1GC2tVSaa	Leo or Sagittarius|`|8gUUVxqnaa	capricorn!!!!!!!|`|J45b1wEkaa	?Taurus of course!!!?|`|28TJbbNHaa	Taurus.. but I'm bais... :)|`|arg5PBgqaa	leo is the dumbest of all.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aquarius because they are intelligent, unique, humanitarian and they fight for causes that they believe in.<br>  Sagittarius because they are fun, sweet, nice and flirty.
mD7eAAoNaa	Virgo Sun<br>  Cancer Moon<br>  Scorpio Rising<br>  <br>  As you said, I think I can relate to all three signs in different situations. I have the typical characteristics of a Virgo and am pretty methodical and serious in whatever I do. My emotions like the Cancer run hot and cold, I am pretty moody and sensitive (not in a good way). And thanks to my Scorpio rising I am very unapproachable. I think I have a very intense look and look angry all the time, when I'm not. I also like to be secretive, don't like people knowing too much about me. Overall, thanks to the 3 signs, I'd like to say that I am misunderstood.|`|utJE0EyIaa	I got Leo/Pisces/Leo<br>  <br>  Relate to both.. since I have Mercury also in Leo. Emotions i'm much like a Pisces. But my personality is very dominating and outgoing traits that I think come from being a Leo.|`|ETGMj8Hoaa	in your case i think your air rising feeds your fire sun and moon and that's why your personality grows just with the way other people perceive you, in my case that earthy look i have makes people to like kind of low my real personality, air can be trapped into earth... so that's not like soo cool for me... but that's also why you love your rising becuz provides enough area for your sun and moon to develop at 100%|`|eT6SsCaraa	I'm a Pisces Sun, Sagittarius Ascendant, Libra Moon<br>  <br>  I have to say my Pisces traits are definitely dominant, I'm really kind, caring, empathic, sensitive dreamy... but online, I often put on my Sagittarius mask to hide all my pain and suffering inside. I'm just as kind and caring and empathetic, but I look more like a strong, confident and outgoing individual. Hmm.. I think I get my peacemaker attribute from my libra moon.. I avoid conflict.. stuff like that.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Leo/Sag/Aqua/Libra Mars<br>  <br>  I relate to each of them the same,I think that it simply depends on the situation.
gD80pZM6aa	Yah i think ur right the way the whole movie flowed with its music made it was it is today.

UXUKwJSwaa	Both. <br>  <br>  A band can achieve mainstream sucess, even if they are playing completely unmiainstream sounding music. I do believe even Cannibal Corpse achieved some mainstream acknowledgement back in the early nineties. <br>  <br>  However, there is the mainstream sound - a band that goes just for selling records would be considered mainstream if they made it big.|`|4ObhfxoIaa	To me, mainstream is a band that everyone knows and likes just because everyone else likes them, even if they suck. <br>  Everyone at my school listens to ATL, FTSK, The Maine, WTK...etc <br>  I think everyone can agree on those bands. <br>  I think it would be sound, because all the bands everyone in my area listen to sound exactly the same you can barley tell them apart|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	I think it's a state. As much as people complain that "Oh my god all the music played on the radio sounds the same," I don't think it does. Rihanna and The Strokes and Death Cab and The White Stripes and Katy Perry all sound pretty different to me. And I think it's fair to consider all of them pretty mainstream, right?<br>  <br>  That's what's so stupid about it. People hate all mainstream music, not necessarily for its sound apparently, but just for the sake of being original and unique and all that junk. When people avoid popular music just because it's popular, they're just as contrived and fake as those who only listen to Top 40 songs because it's "cool."|`|JQHOpMT4aa	I prefer bands that in between. Theses bands may have been considered mainstream at one point but nobody listens to them anymore. Bands like coldplay, U2,  Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Snow Patrol are just popular and not mainstream because they have a different sound (which is why I like them) . Some bands I also like are: Third Eye Bind, Counting Crows, The Shins, REM, My Morning Jacket, Train, The Wallflowers, and Dave Mathews Band.<br>  <br>  A mainstream band to me is a band that people will like just because it is on the "cool" radio station. Most of the time these bands are all about being hot or marketing, a lot of times both. People will even listen to them even if they suck, because they have been brainwashed to think they make good music. Here are some mainstream bands to me: Nickel Back, Maroon 5, Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, My Chemical Romance, Boys Like Girls, Disturbed, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, System of a Down, Red Jumpsuit Apparatuses, Buck Cherry, God Smack, Seether, Foo Fighters, and Metro Station. These are just the music a lot of bands try to emulate in their respective genre. Of course this is excluding pop which is the most contrived and monotonous genre ever. Unfortunately the Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox 20 have moved from popular to Mainstream with their newest albums.|`|PDxQWnlraa	I have no idea what you are asking but I do know that mainstream, in my opinion, is over popular, generic sounding bands who make music that people these days are *comfortable* with. (aka. any rap, Jonas Brothers, etc...)|`|cUH60vdGaa	gonna have to agree. the state.<br>  <br>  although it is very true that having a certain slick, polished sound makes a band/artist a lot more likely to be "mainstream" - i often describe relatively unknown artists as being "mainstream-sounding" because of the sound quality etc - just like i use the term "indie" for some mainstream acts, because their sound is more similar to underground artists.<br>  <br>  for example, someone mentioned the strokes - i would describe them as a "mainstream indie band" - if that's not too confusing :)<br>  <br>  basically, what i'm saying is i don't see mainstream as a genre. you can have mainstream rock, rap, country, alternative, metal, folk, pretty much anything. but just like it would be silly to dismiss one of those genres - for example, "i hate all metal", it is just as lazy to discount music just because of its popularity ("i hate mainstream" or conversely, "if i haven't heard of it, it must be no good".)<br>  <br>  now "pop" - that's a different matter :)|`|csOHQS54aa	I'll admit I'm one of those annoying people who has less respect for a band when they become "mainstream", but i'll put that aside for a moment.<br>  <br>  Like take the Beatles: probably the most popular, widespread, mainstream ever. But still they had an incredibly unique sound, exploring everything from user friendly stuff that everyone likes, like Hey Jude, to completely weird experimental stuff like Revolution 9 while still getting everything they did played on the radio. I think its definitely possible for a band to be popular and keep its originality, as long as the people care more about music than money.<br>  <br>  so yeah, it's a state not a sound.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	I think its both.  I consider both to be mainstream.  Some I like, some I don't.  I know this isn't a long intuitive answer, but oh well.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Mainstream to me is sound :)<br>  <br>  Bryan...yahoo lets me post again wooooooooooooo

mTSRtNt1aa	1, Most likely... come to think about it maybe since his own son is Ace, wow i never really thought of that. Possibly maybe he could join :P<br>  <br>  2, Since he could remodel an inside of somebody maybe its possible to change his water levels inside his body since most of your body is made out of water maybe he will use that to harden crocs body just like luffy used water to harden croc for his weakness. <br>  <br>  3, I think from this question i believe it is whitebeard time of age to end, i believe from all the marines, admirals and the warlords he wont stand a chance, plus his old age is a big disadvantage. <br>  <br>  4, I think about 4 or 5 more chapters and just before aces execution and the war i guess Oda is going to switch it over to show the other straw hats adventures to add up tension for the war of whitebeard before changing the scene back to aces execution. <br>  <br>  5, I loved eustass kids and capones devil fruit powers, they were two unique powers i could never think of. I also liked Apoo's but shamed he got beaten by Kizaru, hope to see more of him. Of course i also loved Kizarus light devil fruit =). <br>  <br>  6, The person im most intrested seeing fighting is of course Sengoku since i would want to know his true power. Akainu is another individual i would want to see fighting too. I would also want to see Mihawk use his powers again just for old time sake and see doflamingos power to see if he really is a strong person and does not rely all his power on a devil fruit. Apart from that i heard Jango and Fullbody would be fighting too so i would like to see them involved :P <br>  <br>  7, Well Croc i might hope of joining and probobly buggy and mr 3. If your talking about luffys team at the moment tht is.<br>  <br>  8, I believe that the main big villain for this arc or saga maybe would have to be Magellan, i just guess Luffy would have a rematch with him more confident and have a good chance of beating him since he lost once over fighting Ace and he will fight until his death to save Ace. Imagine how much his bounty would rise if he beat the chief of impel down! <br>  <br>  9, Theres a possibly all of them would come back at the same time, but i highly doubt it. <br>  <br>  10, Boa Hancock, im really like attracted and in love with this woman. I just need to think of something unattractive happening with this woman for once and iva changing her gender would be a perfect unattraction for her. ;D <br>  Plus it serves for her right for fighting the whitebeard pirates and not sticking with Luffy i guess. ;P<br>  <br>  Wow thanks for the questions, got me thinking... have a nice day!|`|M34BqrDLaa	I - Possible, since he plans to rid WG anyway.<br>  II - Maybe he was a woman before.<br>  III - Probable. But no one dies in OP, right?<br>  IV - The main goals of the OP crew haven't been achieved yet, so it's far from over.<br>  V - Eustass Kid's and Trafalgar Law's devil fruit abilities are interesting.<br>  VI - All of them. An total war.<br>  VII - OMGWTFBBQ!! I hope that Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, Mr. 3, Buggy, and Hancock could join.<br>  VIII - They would fight Magellan, Hannyabal, Saldeath, Sadi-chan and the Four Great Demon Guards, Domino, and other prison guards.<br>  IX - Hmm... I dunno. Maybe some will be able to, but we don't know how far were they sent by Kuma.<br>  X - Everyone!|`|OgfERkYxaa	1. Yes not many if anyone knows ace and dragon are related<br>  2. no idea it must be pretty painful though<br>  3.No someone will stop it,No white beard it to strong, There will be alot of deaths but no one important<br>  4.There is going to be quite a few more chapters and hopefully all the others members will meet somewhere<br>  5. I like law's devil fruit power<br>  6.I wanna see Mihawk fight cause hes awesome<br>  7. This team is awesome and Luffy doesnt even know that the fishmen is a schibukia and if Mihawk joined the team that would be awesome<br>  8. maybe schickbukia vs luffys new team<br>  9.I think that none of the members will make it in time but it will be awesome if they did<br>  10. i hope he/she changes the vice wardens gender|`|yTqMSAd2aa	1. nah i don't think so. I think he is only gonna get involved if Ace dies.<br>  <br>  2. I have no Idea but I bet it's not liquid. i mean it's not the same luffy already knows that's for sure.<br>  <br>  3. nope Ace and Blackbeard will both survive. I don't know how and i am not sure Luffy will do it but somebody will free Ace.<br>  <br>  4. I don't think they will play a big role in this one, that's the only bad part of it. so until they meet up again, we might not see them much, at least not a big adventure.<br>  <br>  5. the one that Kizaru had: light. it is so cool.<br>  <br>  6. I so wanna see how powerful Whitebeard really is.<br>  <br>  7. that is what I call a team man. they are gonna kick some major ***.<br>  <br>  8. I bet Luffy or one of them is gonna fight Magellan. I bet on Luffy beating him this time.<br>  <br>  9. nope. they aren't even aware of what's going on.<br>  <br>  10. I wish he would change buggy. he'd be funny as a girl.<br>  <br>  I think it might even be better than CP9. and I really really loved CP9.<br>  CHEERS!

She reads all the messages and does occasionally reply.  Just remember that she is very busy.  If you want a response write something more profound than "I'm you're #1 fan" or "I think you're hot" or "It would mean so much if you would post a comment on my page" because that's what everybody says (and we're talking about thousands of people).|`|968db7dce5b5df821c1702a4a8e7b614aa	She has only MySpace page|`|8ab98fb289117867667d2fd50754d153aa	im not sure if she has one. but you can connect with her through her myspace.<br>  <br>  www.myspace.com/ladysovereign

Ew7hXGFtaa	Paréidolia-<br>  I liked them a lot! The first song kind of gave off a Kamelot type feeling, but not quite as good cause not many people have the kind of voice Roy Khan has. I would and probably will listen to more of them.<br>  <br>  Pathfinder-<br>  First of all, the artwork at the top caught my eye at first and I love it when bands do that for some reason. It was pretty good, I definitely liked the instruments way more than the singing. The lead singer bugged me a little especially during the verses. <br>  <br>  Professor Fate-<br>  They where really good! :D It was really epic but at the same time songs like "Limbo" where also very relaxing and calming. Cool band all around.<br>  <br>  Qantice-<br>  Another really coo background to the myspace that caught my eye! It was very good I thought. The lead singer can really sing although I do wish he would kind of put a little bit more feeling and emotion into his voice but other than that good.<br>  <br>  RainKnight-<br>  That was definitely an interesting band haha. I loved the woman singing but that guys singing just really didn't do it for me. Especially during the verses. I would listen to a song every once and a while but other than that I probably wouldn't listen to them much. They do have Pantera as one of there top friends so that does earn them some coolness points =P<br>  <br>  Red Dawn-<br>  I actually loved them! They where probably my favorite band on this question so far. The vocals where really good and even though they used a ton of keyboards I really liked that about them.<br>  <br>  Redeemers-<br>  I knew it was a good sign when I saw they are influenced by bands like Nightwish and Blind Guardian to name a few. I liked that a lot. I loved that whole cool story telling kind of feel of the first song. That along with the really good singing made that a great song and they are a good overall band.<br>  <br>  Romance Curse-<br>  I really liked this band! Her voice is great and the rest of the band was really solid too! The only way I would be able to explain that would just be epic! :D<br>  <br>  Sagittarius-<br>  You ended this on a really good note in my opinion. I loved that guys voice and the whole feel of it. The only thing is, I don't know whether to call the lyrics dumb or amazing. lol I think I will go with amazing cause cheesiness is good sometimes and I think it works for them.|`|srtoPxN2aa	I listened to Pareidolia and liked what I heard. I will spend some time listening to the others later :)|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	I love French bands!! Paréidolia is awesome!!!! I really like the first song "Jour de Froid" (Day of Cold) :P Epic song!!!<br>  <br>  Pathfinder, I'm still a skeptic when it comes to power metal, but I kinda dig these dudes!<br>  <br>  I've heard "Limbo" before!!!! I love that song!!! Ulver For the win!!! "The Gates Of Hell" is an epic song too!!!! <br>  <br>  Qantice is pretty cool!! Vicky's on a symphonic kick :P<br>  <br>  I think RainKnight is my favorite so far!! They're awesome!! "How Can I Live" is such a cool song!<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the vocals in Red Dawn, but musically, they're pretty good!<br>  <br>  I like the Redeemers! The keys in "Religious Man" are fantastic! He trys to sing some very unflattering notes though XD<br>  <br>  Eh... Romance Curse is very much your kind of band, but I'm not sure how I feel about them :P<br>  <br>  Sagittarius is awesome!!! Epic final choice, dude! I think they're awesome!!! "The Song" really tickles my pickle!|`|tlj3c50Haa	Paréidolia - I liked it, but I didn't think it was amazing. The vocals sort of put me off... I think that them being in French stopped me disliking it altogether lol... I just thought it worked. xD<br>  <br>  Pathfinder - Haha I loved the music! And when the singing got into the chorusy bits with the backing singers, it was good, but otherwise it sounded like he was finding it really difficult and straining to be heard, so it makes my throat feel all awkward and it annoys me. If that makes any sense at all. <br>  <br>  Professor Fate - I love them! Such preeeetty music! ^.^<br>  <br>  Qantice - I love them too, even if they sound like Dragonforce to me. But that's because I don't listen to enough metal. ><;;<br>  <br>  RainKnight - The music was okay, but the vocals made me want to kick someone down the stairs. Lol.<br>  <br>  Red Dawn - At first I thought 'Meh, this is boring' then I was like 'Oh! A *tune*! How delightful!' and really liked it. I love all their keyboardy bits, but the singing is just so... eh, for me. It sounds too cheesy, sorry. XD<br>  <br>  Redeemers - First of all, while I'm waiting for it to load, their logo is so pretty! Rather Tim Burton. Anyway. Their music is gorgeous, but I can't decide about the guy's voice. I loooove the way it sounds when he's speaking or singing normally, but when he goes all dramatic and high it makes me cringe. Hers is really good though, so I think I can maybe get over that. <br>  <br>  Romance Curse - I really liked them! ...I have nothing else to say. ^^;;<br>  <br>  Sagittarius - I really really like them, but I hate "The Song". I did like it until that bloody flute thing started. It's just so... faun-y! Lol ignore me. xD<br>  <br>  I think Redeemers are my favourite out of them. ^.^|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Hello, Vicky! :D<br>  <br>  I don't have much time lol, so I only checked out the first band. Paréidolia is awesome! :)<br>  <br>  Why did Darth get 6 TDs? **** the trolls.<br>  <br>  *****Here's some advice, Darth: If you ignore the TDs, they'll eventually realize that they're not making any impact on you and will leave you alone.

GBKaftrJaa	Boy!  I'm so glad you asked. It never even occurred to me that the murderer could be avenging Marty.  Oh that opens a lot of possibilities doesn't it? I like the long lost kid idea.

Wow, now I can't wait to watch and see who it is.|`|KqQlWbYsaa	In all honesty, I don't believe that the writers of OLTL will ever be going THAT route.

But, it would be just like them to do just that like we are stupid or something. It would be a good plot twist for sure though.
R3Jtm4Wtaa	It is supposed to mimic the sound of an electric guitar played through a wah-wah pedal.

Most of your lyrics don't have the correct count of syllables in each line.  That's a real crucial part of song writing.  In fact count how many syllables you have in your first verse and try to come up with something that fits both the count of syllables and the theme of the song.  Trust me, I am the official songwriter of my band, and they think I am good at it.  Are you going for a long song?  Because if you keep on putting that many chorus', you are bound to have a 7-9 min. song with 4 chorus'.  I've done a song with 3 chorus' and it lasted 5-6 min. with the band I play for.  Other than that, I would probably add a line to the last verse.

Our hero has a hard time believing she doesn't want to read the letter, so he sends it special delivery to make sure it arrives. When that letter gets sent back, he decides to hand-deliver it.|`|9ywoPzTsaa	"Return to Sender, Address unknown" is what you are supposed to put on a letter if it got to the correct address, but the person no longer lives there and left no forwarding address.<br>  <br>  So there's 2 ways to look at it...<br>  <br>  The person that the letters are being sent to has moved and can't be found...<br>  <br>  Or the person is absolutely refusing any contact.|`|CE895mvbaa	It means take it back to where you got it from....lol|`|rzvRgFX1aa	It means his death, he is being returned to his sender!

You can find some live feeds of the odd show, and by odd I mean odd, obscure etc.  You also have to endure commercials on them.<br>  <br>  I sell a guide that tells you how to download current and past hit tv shows, and current movies, all in HD and all commercial free.  You typically can download them 30 to 60 minutes after they air on cable/DTV.
T644csEIaa	i would say definitely not to your last question. dont forget with computers these days we can make all sorts of new sounds and also look at all the old african and asian instruments and how they could evolve|`|wAGdGYbpaa	Personally I feel that rather than inventing new instruments, they should take some away. I have always been partial to the spoons and harmonica, oh and that thing where you put wax paper over a comb and blow to get a buzzy noise.|`|q26iYJVOaa	I don't think all musical instruments have been invented.  Look at the saxophone, it is relatively new compared to other instruments.  There are still innovations on existing instruments.  The seven-string guitar hasn't existed for a real long time.

By the way, the songs "Love You" and "Wherever You Are" are awesome. They're my favorites, too.|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	I'm surprised you haven't heard "That's A Man" yet.Pretty big song right now..And I'm with ya on "Lips Of An Angel".That was just sick and wrong.

BAhcJfAQaa	Wow, that sure brings back memories.<br>  <br>  Hmmm... I would have to say FBI agent Cooper, and the character that Sherilyn Fenn played.|`|AA10014137	I love that show!!  It's sad that it just abruptly ends.<br>  <br>  My fav character was the main fbi agent Cooper who drank coffee all the time. <br>  <br>  But, so many of the characters were so odd and funny...Audrey, the log lady and and the boy who wore skirts (David Duchovny!!). <br>  <br>  My fav episode? Hard to say I liked them all. Perhaps season 2 opener when Cooper has visions of the giant... that was scary.|`|2S7Q06cBaa	I liked it, fave was the man who ate cherry pie.<br>  But the theme music is what I remember most, I love it.|`|5b6c51bc38cdc1af6d0b4a46aa8b907eaa	I love it, I have both seasons on DVD. <br>  <br>  I love Andy the police officer he cracks me up! I also like Albert Rosenfeld, and of course Coop!<br>  <br>  one of my favourits episodes is when Agent Bryson turns up, they crack me up.|`|bd11857558116c48407260cc6f5d59bdaa	I used to watch that it scared the hell out of me ! I think that Kyle McClaughlan character was prob my fave and Bobby was fit -  that Bob used to give me nightmares!

DphUE9tbaa	Great stuff.  I saw them around 1985 or 86.  It took them longer to get success than it should have, but they were still one of the best bands around at their peak.|`|nspb1CQraa	ive always felt them to be "what the industry wants me to hear".<br>  <br>  i feel this song is not one of their best and i still dont see the overall appeal of this outfit.<br>  <br>  its much like radiohead or coldplay...not for me, thank you.<br>  <br>  now playing: motor ready - alabama thunderpussy|`|tuAfrhaIaa	Yeah,good song but not the best track on Green.I prefer Turn You Inside-Out,Pop Song 89 and You Are The Everything..<br>  I can vaguely remember them playing this on Top Of The Pops-Stipe had his megaphone if my memory serves me right..|`|qHayYSSzaa	Not bad!<br>  <br>  By far the best R.E.M song, although I prefer the version that was released on the album 'Green'|`|fOcItiY1aa	Not one of their best.|`|dMuvPsewaa	I don't like REM - a bit too wishy washy for my liking.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Probably my favorite R.E.M song.<br>  <br>  I've always been indifferent on them.  It seems like they just tried to hard to be commercial, and didn't really do what they wanted to do.
CUiJfDDVaa	I m not sure i think Demi Lovato<br>  <br>  thanks
9KQwu3oUaa	You sound good! And you're so pretty.<br>  It's a little hard to hear you over the other lady's voice but you have a good voice. Just sing louder but make sure you don't push your voice. Okay, I don't know if this makes sense, but try just letting your voice go and pretend the people aren't there. I've been in choir forever too, and I guess I'm just used to performing. But I find it easier to just look at the conductor and not even acknowledge that there are people watching me.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	Take off your hood you goof, you sing wonderful, no need to hide.  Your voice is just like any instrument people may play.  Try to suck in more air, using your diaphragm, not your chest.  You'll get more sound and won't feel out of breath if you do.  If you can sing in front of your family, try singing in front of a friend in the car listening to music.  Or in your room, where ever.  It is really hard to sing in front of people alone.  Taking a chorus class helps because you get so used to it.  Good luck.|`|jU2EJ4QTaa	wow i like it very good.....if u work on it u will be a singer someday good job|`|texnwiJxaa	tbh it was average not the best not the worst work on staying in key

Just about every song they make has the potential to be a hit but you can only release so many singles. One of my fav groups of all time!|`|6e7c5613f15ec88b290050a52ad86baeaa	They are the only Group i listen to.. well the only english music i listen to.... been down with Bone since COACU came out in 93..<br>  <br>  the style they brought to the game is like many other try to duplicate.  Cant wait for they new single that is supose to come out within a week, (prays it doees come out).  Album with all 5 coming in june.<br>  <br>  think about all there accomplishments and the Fan Base they have is like no other.  other artist wish they had a loyal fan base like bone thugs do.  i member Swiss beats called us a cult.. lol|`|gTWhW11Uaa	there pretty cool im not that big of a fan tho. i like how they switch up from singing to rapping<br>  <br>  o yea and tha crossroads is such a sick song to listen when your high|`|xgBNImTHaa	their the **** they got songs from lovey duvvy stuff to pothead stuff to gangsta stuff|`|fE5M8Tloaa	They're average, I hyped them up too much 2 years ago when I was obssessed.|`|EVh3WR6Laa	They are the truth!!!|`|kHSPH0RBaa	I love them.

Cleveland because his name is Cleveland and he talks weird|`|sUZxELpeaa	Cleavland when he went on tour with black box (ow)|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	Stewie!

The entire setting was different and calmer, more relaxing and that is just what Dr. Addison needed.  She came back to Seattle and said adios.  This was the pilot type intermission of leaving Grey's to Private Practice I guess.  Kinda cool how both shows connect and I was happy to see her back in the past 2 episodes of this season.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	Addison went to a fertility clinic in LA to meet some familiar friends. Life had been stressful for Addison since coming to Seattle so she needed to start a new, fresh life.

AA11700517	I believe that it's going to end like the other versions. Personally, I love the money they spend to make this drama, but overall, Boys Over Flower has flaws I didn't see in Meteor Garden or Han Yori Dango. I still think that Meteor Garden is the best one so far because there were a lot of details, actions, and monologue/emotions. In fact, the Meteor Garden casts did a fantasic job on their characters, whereas Boys over Flower is...uh...not very good or detailed. Everything seems to pass so fast in the Korean version, which isn't good. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I do believe Jun Pyo is going to end up with Jandi (I don't like the fact that she wears circle lenses all the time and don't portray the lead character very well.) But I think that Jun Pyo will have feelings for the girl he is engaged too, although not as deep as his feelings for Jandi. If you realize, both girls have similar personality and are pretty, so it's likely he'll fall for her as well, like in the other 2 versions. <br>  <br>  You know, I'm not really into this Korean version, but I'm only watching it because Lee Min Ho is so damn hot!! He looks so much like Jerry Yan in Meteor Garden, except he's like a younger version of him. LOL! Sorry, I didn't mean to diss Boys Over Flower, but so far, I do like it. Don't be suprised when they make Boys over Flower 2 or the Final Movie. ^_^! I'm guessing it's very possible.|`|Z91ePgTsaa	Well the Korean version is going to end like in the others as well, so they both are going to end up together. In Meteor Garden her almost relationship with Hua Ze Lei (Ji Hoo in the Korean one) was more there, that for a while I wanted Shan Cai to be with him, esp in the 2nd season. <br>  <br>  Goo Joon Pyo is too much in love with Jan Di to fall for the new girl, the next episode is going to make me laugh a lot in that part where he drags after him the wrong girl and doesn't realize it, the idiot hehe. <br>  <br>  I hope in this version that the story between So Yi Jung (Kim Bum) and her best friend Ga Eul is more explored coz they really have chemistry between them, not like in the other versions. I'm rooting for them.|`|ct78bd3laa	I watched the japanese version and i hope it ends like it!<br>  <br>  I really want jan di and jun pyo to be together!!!!!!!! I know it will end with<br>  them back together :D<br>  i just watched ep 16.<br>  The fiancee of jun pyo is really bugging me because she tells jan di<br>  that she will make jun pyo love him and doesn't even know that jan di's<br>  first love IS jun pyo!!! I feel so sorry for jan di =(<br>  she doesn't even know that jan di still loves jun pyo!!!!!!!!!!!|`|brdqJO1iaa	so i personal LovE boys over flower....<br>  i think that geum jandi and jyunpyo r going to be together<br>  i think that jihoo is guem jandi's soulmate and jyunpyo.....<br>  JYUNPYO MIGHT BE JANDI'S FUTurE HUBBY :P<br>  i want jyunpyo and jandi's relationship to go well :]]|`|I1gpt80Xaa	I hope JanDi ends up with JoonPyo, I can't wait when ep 15 comes out tomorrow.

w0q8yOowaa	read all da other questions u will get all da answers u need|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	I think they ought to throw BOTH their sorry butts in jail myself -- Chris for beating her up and Rhianna for allowing to get this bad before she finally did something about it.|`|FbwyvwEYaa	OHMAHGAWSH.<br>  <br>  This has to be the most asked question on Yahoo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Picture of her when she was beat up: <a href="http://www.oceanup.com/rihanna/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oceanup.com/rihanna/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT HAPPENED: At the request of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, Chris Brown is being investigated for felonies, including domestic violence, assault resulting in great bodily injury and based on specific allegations made by Rihanna, even attempted murder, a source told E! News. <br>  <br>  Prosecutors fear that proving any serious felony charges would be difficult in a case where there are no direct witnesses other than Rihanna and Brown. Brown is accused of beating Rihanna the morning of Feb. 8, causing them both to cancel their scheduled Grammy performances that night. <br>  <br>  Rihanna told police that, while the two were fighting in his rented Lamborghini, Brown said to her, 'I'm going to kill you,' while his hands were around her neck. The Barbados-born songstress, who is reportedly cooperating with the cops' investigation, also told authorities that Brown choked her until she lost consciousness.. <br>  <br>  Brown was booked by police on suspicion of making criminal threats, but the DA's office wanted further investigation into the incident before it decided on pressing charges. Chris is currently back home with his family in Virginia. <br>  <br>  Rihanna was treated after the incident at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and was discharged the following night. She spent last week with her family in Babardos before departing for parts unknown. <br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT HER PARENTS SAID:<br>  Rihanna's father, Ronald Fenty, talked to People about when he first heard that his daughter had been attacked by Chris Brown, 'I didn't believe it. I know my daughter. You think you know somebody, but you really don't.'<br>  <br>  On Ri's current condition: 'There is some bruising. She will be alright. I think so. At some point, she will speak out. I hope she will stand up for women all over the world.. They seemed pretty happy. I don't know what went wrong.' <br>  <br>  Chris Brown's biological father, Clinton Brown, told People: 'Chris is reflecting on this situation. He's very remorseful. He's very concerned about the situation and he wants to make sure that [Rihanna's] okay. This is unfortunate, this stumble, this situation. Hopefully, he will get past it. We all have our shortcomings. <br>  <br>  We all trip. There are two sides to every story. If you are on his side, you are on his side. Just because someone trips, if you are truly a fan, you are not going to demonize him instantaneously.'<br>  <br>  Brown worries about the public backlash: 'This music industry is very unforgiving when it comes to having indiscretions. He will continue to be a good person. He loves people. And like most of us, most humans, things will occur. <br>  <br>  Hopefully a person won't be judged simply on that alone. As a father, I couldn't be more proud.. He's the light of my life. I think he's going to grow as an individual. He's going to take from this situation and learn from it.' <br>  <br>  MORE INFO:Rihanna told law enforcement that Chris Brown has attacked her before. According to TMZ, the Los Angeles County District Attorney has ordered police to further investigation because evidence against Chris is still lacking. However, he will almost certainly be charged with felony domestic battery. <br>  <br>  According to the police report, here is what happened that fateful night: After Chris received a text message from a woman who wrote about getting together, an argument erupted. By the way, initially, Rihanna would not tell cops what started the argument. <br>  <br>  She did, however, tell them that during the argument, he started hitting her. She ordered him to drive her home and 'faked a call' to someone, saying things like, 'He's dropping me off. Make sure the cops are there.' Rihanna told cops the fake call enraged Brown. He said something to the effect of 'You are really fu**ed up now. I'm going to kill you.' <br>  <br>  This statement is the basis of the criminal threats charge. At that point, Brown allegedly began a violent attack with his fists. At some point, Rihanna took the keys out of the ignition and threw them outside. According to the police report, she told cops this was not the first time Brown hit her.. <br>  <br>  WHY HE HIT HER: Rihanna's beating by Chris Brown started with a text message, reports NYDN. The fight that landed Rihanna in the hospital ignited when singer Chris Brown got a text message from another woman. The source said: <br>  <br>  'He got a booty call. He got a text. Rihanna saw it and she got upset. They started to argue. She got out of the car. He wanted her to get back in, so he grabbed her. She pulled away. That's when she's told people he hit her.' <br>  <br>  Rihanna had 'visible injuries' when cops arrived. She's been cooperating with the investigation ever since, while not speaking with Brown. 'Chris has been trying to contact her. So far she hasn't taken his call. Her family is on their <br>  way to be with her. She has some close girlfriend looking after her.' <br>  <br>  NOTE: Chris Brown's Doublemint gum and Got Milk? ad campaigns have been suspended. Rihanna has canceled her Jakarta concert, much to fans dismay.<br>  <br>  <br>  There's all the info

qVXmSEVGaa	we women also have a voice change during puberty, even though it isn't as drastic as the men.<br>  Since our bodies are growing, it makes sense that the vocal mechanism grows, too. What determines your eventual adult voice category is more or less genetic.  It has to do with your body build, your bone structure, and what kind of voices are in your female family. Most importantly the structure of your voice box and vocal cords in relation to the rest of your body. If you are, say, a short girl with a proportionately long neck, it may be that you turn out mezzo.  If you are a tall girl with a shorter proportioned neck, maybe a soprano.  (I have met both types.)<br>  that's the basic raw material.  After that comes training, and learning what you do best.<br>  An important factor for us teachers is to find out where your "gear shift" happens. According to the modern pop school of singing, there are only two registers, chest and head.<br>  Many of us classical singers account for three registers, low, middle and high. So there are two gear shifts. ( we call them passagio, since the Italians who invented opera called them that)<br>  Working from the top down:<br>  a soprano will shift from her lowest voice to her middle voice at the Eb, and from middle to high at the F# an octave above that.<br>  a mezzo soprano will shift from low to middle at the d or c#, and from middle to high at the d/Eb an octave above that.<br>  A real contralto ( a very rare voice) will shift from low to middle as low as the B/middle C, and to high voice an octave above that.<br>  It takes careful testing and training from a good teacher to really determine these points. It's not something that can be determined right away.<br>  But,as I said, some voices run in families. If you have any female relatives ( adult) that sing, check out how many sopranos, how many mezzos, how many contraltos you find. this might give a clue as to where you wind up.<br>  the best thing, though is lessons.

ebb4b810f34245706f791aeb50bec63aaa	In the final episode of Season 7 Steve created a cloning machine and used it on himself to create a temporary duplicate.  Laura suggested that the clone should be allowed to stay so he was permanently transformed into the "real" Stefan Urquelle.  So Steve and Stefan were two different people for the remainder of the series.|`|7svUZBrFaa	It's the same person. Stephen is Steve transformed by his machine. You could say that Stephen is Steve's alter ego.|`|IhMktVTIaa	I thought it was his cousin?!?  That's if I remember by Urkel correctly...    Oh, wait you are right .... I just found it online-  Here's what is says:<br>  Urkel's debonair alter ego (created by Steve's transfomation chamber)  was Stephan Urquelle.<br>  <br>  Steve Urkel did play his female cousin though.  Her name was Myrtle Urkel.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps... still not sure how they were in the same episode at the same time?!  But you were correct about the machine thingy!

Sbx0h0eSaa	You're going to HATE this answer, but TRUST ME it works! Don't call or text for a week. If you can handle not doing it whatsoever, HE WILL COME BACK. Also, I highly recommend the book (or movie) He's Just Not That Into You. I really feel for you hun because I'm CRAZY in love with a Cancer guy myself. He's one of my Facebook buddies and it kills me to see him online, Aaaaargh! But you know what? I stopped paying attention to him and just yesterday he called. Keep in mind I'm in the USA and he's from Norway, haha. HANG IN THERE! Cancer men are soooo sensitive. They love feminine type women too. So, my advice would be to stop ALL CONTACT with this guy and HE WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN HIMSELF. Guys love to fights wars and love challenges and when they know they have conquered a female, they know they have won. Let him fight for YOU. Good luck!!!! xxx|`|j0yv0T0oaa	You had no reason for breaking up with him?  There had to be some reason.  He likely does not want to allow you to hurt his feelings again in such a careless way.  <br>  <br>  You will have to know what the causes of the breakup were in order to try to get him back.   If you don't know how the relationship ended, how can you begin again?  You should try to see him in person to know if he still has feelings for you.  Apologize for the ways that you hurt him and tell him you miss him in your life.  Think of the ways he added to the quality of your life to make your case. <br>  You'll have to keep a lot of focus on him as you will have to make a case for how letting you back in his life will make him happy. In what ways do you care about him?  What can you do for him?<br>  Think about these things long and hard before you ask him to give you another chance.  Why shouldn't he move on from you?  <br>  Be prepared to let him go and accept his friendship if that is all you can manage at this time.  Be his friend and if you are meant for each other, eventually, you will find your way back into his arms.  If you let him go so easily before, you need to be sure that it really is him that will make you happy and that you are not just lonely or bored at the moment.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	letters!

Ow3O7h4caa	Sagittarius in 7th house always gives many relationships usually and makes you a happy-go-lucky type. Having said this, you need a long leash because freedom is important. You have a mental approach to relations due to Gemini rising and Sagittarius on the 7th often brings you in contact to a person who is foreign-born.<br>  Twins rising linked to the Centaur points the way to a free-spirited, open, and fundamentally friendly  attitude to all forms of relationships. Emotional depth, deep passionate attachment, and jealous insecurity are not part of this picture.<br>  <br>  Because Jupiter is retrograde, you will repeat the joys, the sorrows and mistakes in relatinships. Often, their is a delay in their fulfillment, in the timing etc... Court suits are sometimes ill-timed and oftenit is too late to adequately solve the problems for optimum results.<br>  <br>  With Jupiter in 2nd house, money will be an important factor in your relationships. Although Jupiter often indicates good fortune in 2nd house, it depends on the sign and its dignity and if well aspected. You can use your talents very expansively and can seize upon financial opportunities when they come your way. But because of the retrograde, you will often miss opportunities or react too late to the invitation.<br>  ON another level, Jupiter often gives rise to being speculative because you specified Leo is on the cusp, and also impratical leading to large loss, But, one thing positive, Jupiter never leaves a person with Jupiter in second house, empty-handed or without money. You will always have money in your pocket.<br>  <br>  One last thing, their is a tendency to a slow but steady progress through life but with some delays. It depends on the aspects Jupiter received. The aspects to Jupiter will determine the quality of your earnings, whether they will be easy or hard. The aspects will also show the people are help or hinder you in the process, again, determined by the trines or squares respectively.<br>  <br>  Edit...for Gemini to be in an Anaretic degree, it would have to be rising at 0 degree, or in a critical degree like the 4th and 17th degree. The 29th degree is also a critical degree.|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	I also have a Gemini Ascendant - at 28.49 degrees..so my descendant is in Sagittarius too..<br>  <br>  && My Jupiter is in Leo..<br>  <br>  I wanna know what this all means too! lol in terms of being Retrograde..i'll come back to check answers..x<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yeah sounds good|`|bdttDnlwaa	To have Jupiter in Leo, in House II, and Ruler of the Descendant, is a very good placement.<br>  <br>  So nothing to worry about this.<br>  <br>  It looks good for future partnerships. You are most likely to attract a strong and sunny personality, proud, enthusiastic, open, sincere, confident, big hearted, noble, prestigious, very generous with his or her time, and money !<br>  <br>  Partnerships can be personal or professional, or both.<br>  <br>  My advice, if this is the case : do not criticize the person. On the contrary, respect and pay compliments. It is just that the sensitivity is there.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, at best, Geminis, or people who are rising Gemini, are very flexible, versatile, dextrous, curious of mind and spirit, easily amused, interesting and interested.<br>  <br>  So all this will go well.<br>  <br>  Now, about this Retrograde thing.<br>  <br>  "When Jupiter is Retrograde, it needs to expand inward at a psychological level, before it can move out into the world. It quests for its own truth and personal knowing, whether or not its theory agree with those of others. When philosophical or theoretical conflicts arise, Retrograde Jupiter finds its own answers, confident that it has enough perspective and knowledge to explain contradictions and resolve any confusion. It may create elaborate, internally developed systems to explain the nature of things. Whether or not the world listens, Retrograde Jupiter understands and teaches."<br>  <br>  As usual, it depends largely on the individual Chart as a whole and in details.<br>  <br>  Take care.

I almost always star all of my contacts' Qs.<br>  But if I don't have the time to answer a question; or if I don't know the answer to it, I star it so that my contacts can.<br>  2. I TD when an answer is incorrect. Or if it has nothing to do with that question. Or if someone lists crappy bands like MCR or FOB. lol<br>  3. I always TU all the answers on my questions.<br>  I think it's a bit unfair when people TU only the answers the regs give.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	1.

Yeah, I usually spend most of the time on Answers checking back and looking at the new answers and seeing what people thought of my answers (by way of thumbs up or down)<br>  <br>  2. Yes, if it's a stupid answer, says something completely off, trolls, bothering someone else for no reason. Those are some reasons, I can't think of the others :)<br>  <br>  3.

I mostly star them because I don't know the answer, but I know one of my contacts will know, so if I star it, they might look at it and give the asker a good answer.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, I give thumbs down for a lot of reasons.  I don't just do it because I don't like a band or the answerer, but I do TD for really bad answers, answers that have nothing to do with the question, or any other reason I see fit.<br>  <br>  3. I give TUs to almost every contact when they answer, and for the ones I don't know, I will TU if they give a good answer, and one that I think they actually put thought into.<br>  <br>  BA: evilA flesruoY peeK - neeuQ|`|5HvdcWvBaa	1.

I usually do it if I find that the answer did not respond to the question properly. Also, I do it if the I strongly disagree with the opinion or rarely because I'm in a bad mood and someone is pissing me off.<br>  <br>  3.

Yea, I do. Probably the biggest reason I give thumbs down is when someone is insulting bands/musicians on questions that are not meant to have anything insulting on it. Like many people have said here, I do TD for stupidity too.<br>  <br>  3. I usually TU a lot of people on the question.

I don't go back on them, if I find it really interesting I save it to my watch list because I don't do that as much as I star questions.<br>  <br>  2.) Yes, I do, not as much as I give tu, though. I don't give much td's. I never give thumbs down for opinions, even if I disagree. I give thumbs down if the answer is completely ignorant and the user has no idea what they're talking about. I don't know why people care about getting thumbs down, I don't, it's just a pointless rating system, anyway.<br>  <br>  3.) I give thumbs up to thoughtful and great answers.

e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Oh Santhia, I worry about your mental stability with all of these psychic questions. Is there anything in your life you can decide for yourself? I'm not psychic in the least but I can tell that you have a no sense of self and barely any self esteem. If you did you would be confident enough to trust that you could make these simple decisions for yourself. You don't need a psychic to tell you what you already know. I wish you could see that already. I do think you should move on with your life and stop relying on psychics so much. You've never even gotten a viable answer from one and yet you always ask. You worry me.....|`|5qvIZCKXaa	?|`|cuIX13BKaa	I don't mean to sound rude to you...however you are asking for some potential trouble perhaps without realizing it. This is the internet as you know, where people make up personas and hide behind a screen claiming to be one person and actually being myriad other ways. Yes some people are real.....please do NOT make decisions in your life based solely upon the answers that you receive in Y!A. Your life is far too precious for that.I KNOW you can effect a change or changes and move on with your life. If there is any kind of a roadblock or speed bump in your way, just travel with caution. Please don't give out such personal information here....I would fear for you should yo continue. I know or 'think' from your questions you either are in High School or just out of it....... take heed from a Mother with a Daughter whom I dearly love, there is only one YOU.......With that one question, the last one, about moving on with your life....yes...yes of course you can....and should you need someone to go through anything with there are hot lines all over the US pleading with young adults to call if they have questions such as this. Please do NOT compromise your innocence with accepting answers from people who are NOT nice, or they are dicey to say the least....please ask for help...I mean th ein person kind where in you don't need a psychic...but a therapist to work through your issues of having a lack of confidence.

chlGzFQlaa	I've always wanted to be a doctor, a paediatrician until lately. I'm in the 11th grade, been scoring pretty damn well, but I was talking to my physics teacher whose son is trying to get into med school. He's gifted, works at a radio station, graduated from a really good school at the top of his class, marginally gifted, volunteered at a hospital for 4 years, started countless clubs and organizations, scored a 31 on his MCAT (medical exam) and he still couldn't get in... I wonder if it's just in Canada, because if people like that couldn't get in, I wonder how much of a chance I'll have. I'm reconsidering my primary career option, and I think I want to get into engineering, not really sure in what field though, probably engineering physics.... <br>  <br>  PISCES!! YEAH!!!! Nobody's asked in a while|`|utJE0EyIaa	When I was growing up I was reallllly curious lol so I always did experiements and all that fun stuff. I collected rocks, studied them lol I did those wacky experiments that came with the kits.

When I was about 3 or 4 I would bring little orphaned animals home with me and try to keep them as pets lol. I still do want to be one but I don't think I have the patience to go through all of the schooling it would take now that I'm older. Now I want to be a forklift driver. Don't ask :)|`|eT6SsCaraa	I wanted to be an artist... and still do ^_^ Among other things, like counseling, astrology, philosophy, writer...|`|QZzQdh43aa	here's the order<br>  <br>  1. artist (this stuck with me for a very long time)<br>  2. veterinarian<br>  3. hairdresser<br>  4. lawyer<br>  5. surgeon<br>  6. business<br>  <br>  and i'm a cancer|`|CEEQDSCFaa	I wanted to be a Robot driver so i can fight evil monsters|`|FyZsJh0waa	i wanted to be a teacher... haha um i dont like kids though so that doesnt work out<br>  now i want to be a hair stylist|`|J45b1wEkaa	i wanted to be on tv as journalist, a model or work in a bank because my mom used to do that<br>  <br>  Taurus sun leo moon|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Always wanted to be famous xD<br>  As a singer or an actress xD<br>  I still want to be these,but I want to travel the world or be a chef.<br>  Or a DJ.<br>  ;D<br>  <br>  Leo/Sag|`|qoI6lrvZaa	a doctor or an astronomer<br>  im a sagittarius|`|BYCLegzlaa	a meteorologist or journalist<br>  I'm a pisces|`|vzLZaIyKaa	I wanted to be a rockstar<br>  Oh and Capricorn|`|uel6NBOVaa	When I was five years old, I was offered a chance to be a model and I screamed and said I wouldn't do it...I regretted it for a while later, but I ended up going in a better suited direction for myself. <br>  <br>  When I was really young I had a number of job fantasies...the first was to be a ballerina or an ice dancer. Mainly because I loved the outfits they wore, and I wanted to be able to spin in the air. <br>  <br>  Then I started taking an interest in languages. I had an Egyptian pediatrician whom I liked a lot, and I started becoming really interested in the Arabic language and culture. I had decided for a while that I wanted to move to Egypt one day and explore the tombs and be a Hieroglyphics translator.   <br>  <br>  I also had that childish fantasy that I would one day move to Europe and meet one of the few princes that still exist, get married, and live in a lavish castle, hahaha. <br>  <br>  When I was six, I started taking piano lessons, and I ended up becoming really good. I wanted to be a concert pianist from then on, and now I'm on my way to doing my doctoral studies in piano performance. However...my mindset has changed a bit in that I would rather teach at the University level than only perform as that is a difficult lifestyle to achieve true greatness. <br>  <br>  Sorry to write a novel there...lol....I'm procrastinating on my studies. <br>  <br>  Libra Sun, Cancer Moon, Libra Rising, Leo Midheaven, 6th house in Aries|`|AA11899483	when i grow up, i wanna be famous, i wanna be a star, i wanna be in movies! lol i always wanted to act, when i was younger, i was in all the school plays, used to perform in theatres and that. i always used to imitate other family members of mine, and do like a whole sketch of them, but make it more like a comic. not as interested in it now than i used to. though i wouldnt mind it, im more interested in other things as a career choice.
956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	The main character, Dr. Cal Lightman (played by Tim Roth), aided by his colleague Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams), detects deception by observing body language and microexpressions through the Facial Action Coding System, using this talent to assist clients (such as law enforcement). The character is based on Paul Ekman, notable psychologist and expert on body language and facial expressions.<br>  <br>  I think he is called a deception expert.|`|f0c95deaaf11cb4f884379031898dea3aa	They are scientist and are hired to help find the innocent.<br>  <br>  I don't think they have an EXACT title to what their job is.<br>  <br>  I think it's so cool though. I try to use what they teach on the show.

RavvDVpVaa	That's tough, but overall Pharoah Monch wins, because he emcee's and produces (ie Simon Says and all the tracks credited as produced by Organized Konfusion)|`|bLr5Wbmraa	Pharoahe Monch no doubt, i think hes one of the most underrated MC's out there. Cant wait for his new album!|`|NctYwdvhaa	Pharaoh Monch|`|os6FaEBlaa	Pharoahe Monch.|`|oVDQLrYSaa	I think Pharoah Monch got Common,but Common got him on the longevity of the business.|`|okECVBkzaa	Pharoahe Monch<br>  <br>  Tough one. I'll go with him because I like his Organized Konfusion days.

I got a lot of love for canibus as an artist, But he's a little over the top at times.<br>  <br>  (It's almost like, If you rate canibus, You're more in tune with what it means to be a lyricist).<br>  <br>  I think Canibus is a far superior MC..But Ras Kass is a lot more diverse and extremely underrated to the point where he deserves just as much credit as canibus.<br>  <br>  Good comparison.|`|l72FO4eMaa	Ras Kass<br>  <br>  It's hard to judge Canibus after constantly putting out wack albums|`|LyauFqaaaa	canibus. you remember that shiner rass caught lol|`|EMLoY161aa	Canibus|`|MSMem5qYaa	Canibus|`|Y3amnioWaa	definetly the bisman|`|oVDQLrYSaa	Canibus all the way.

Nas killed it lyrically...<br>  <br>  oh and, Marshall Mathers LP was way better than illmatic....|`|yT6Mezweaa	illmatic, is one of if not the best albums ever made.

Illmatic was not Nas's only best album, It was written, Stillmatic, Gods Son.<br>  <br>  Nas was a street poet and a great Lyricist, that is what made him great.|`|haxPqmIgaa	What is so special about you.... haaha jk. your talkin rite. I like nas betta than pac tho it was written and street deciple was good 2 tho...|`|o0U2K84oaa	Nas wanted to be pac but he had some good songs around. But you gotta admit his diss on Jay-Z called Ether. He killed him.|`|mbiMcaTkaa	u r  right  tupac and biggie were the greatest rappers <br>  but the good thing about nas is he makes good songs and thats it|`|HQM9f13gaa	You don't know any thing about hip hop so maybe u should go to rock or country|`|LyauFqaaaa	how can you say pac or biggie was the best? you never seen them at their peak. they were both killed. biggie dropped 2 albums and is the best?. pac and big had a big influence on culture but not the best to ever do it. why you giving dead rappers better promo. you tell me how pac or biggie would sound on raekwons verbal intercourse with 2 top notch emcees.<br>  <br>  eric cartman-  biggie was career was from 94-97. that's not at a peak|`|hcbY89Praa	Only one good album lol... I have no respect for you as a person.<br>  <br>  <br>  It Was Written is considered by some to be even better than Illmatic, and besides Ready to Die, is better than Life After Death and any Tupac album. So is Stillmatic. Even if you hate it, your opinion obviously doesn't matter and you can keep listening to the "thug" Tupac.<br>  <br>  Westside but born in NY dummy!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Where did I say he was the greatest? I'm just saying you can't deny he is great. That is ridiculous to say. Because in a lot of people's mind's he's better than Biggie, and even more people's minds he's better than Tupac. Regardless of whether he is or not, he is still great as a rapper and to say he was worthless is a ridiculous statement and false.|`|sMgDlW2Aaa	i wanna talk to the mayor, to the Governor, to the muthaf***** president, i wanna talk to the FBI, to the CIA, to the muthaf***** congressman|`|ZOoLgSSFaa	well compared to rap now he is a rap legend so thats why a lot of people like him

But really.<br>  <br>  I saw Joe Satriani+Mountain a few months ago! Totally epic! And when Leslie West tripped and fell on stage, it was 234x more epic.

WITH MANY BANDS! SO JEALOUS!<br>  <br>  I saw Willie Nelson last week. Since it is one of only 3 concerts I've ever been to, that was my favorite. (One of the others was Dierks Bently, the other one....I'd rather not admit it because I found out that a Jonas Brother also like them) I was approximately the youngest, thinnest, least hammered person at the concert. And the band he was playing with was sort of swing-ish, which was dissappointing. But it was Willie and I was worried that he would die before I'd ever see him in concert. <br>  <br>  I am still jealous.|`|AA11039335	Even though I've never listened to any of those bands, yaaaay for you! Glad you had a good time! :)<br>  <br>  Favourite concert? Probably Rage Against The Machine because they put on such a ******* great show. :D|`|wTkvkWscaa	Ah, man. That sounds like so much fun!

FAaePWPWaa	Tupac definately does. It's almost like he knew that his life was going to be cut short so he recorded as much songs as he could.

U0FgxEJxaa	Now we have dissing in stereo!  I think the movies should be given a chance "before" everyone starts hating it.  Yes, some live-action movies DO suck bug time, but why must we hate the Dragonball movies "before" either of them are released.  This is just like the hype about the Twilight movie:  The pre-movie hype of how good it would be made me so sick of it that I did not want to see it, nor will I ever.  The dissing of the Dragonball movies (and how bad they will be) in C & A is making me determined to see both movies.  Will there be a Krillion?  I hope so.       <br>  <br>  **prepares self for thumbs down**|`|b10c5828972384201aa770b9f00357b7aa	lol, I know it'll suck very badly -_-<br>  hey, was there a dragon ball live action movie 1 ?!?!?!

i8Pl0Pejaa	I was in a metal/screamo band and screaming is probably one of the best things ever, so let me help you.<br>  Warm up, hella, before you go to practice, or even during, and actually use your diaphragm to sing, otherwise you'll mess up not only your throat but your lungs as well. Drink tons of water, or milk (yeah, it actually works, i drink it before every show, small tip from Angela from Arch Enemy when I met her at a concert) <br>  Its awesome you wanna do screamo, so good luck, and if you need anymore help you should probably Google it, but don't do any screaming until you're totally warmed up to avoid messing up your voice.|`|AcPDvWYTaa	uhhm on youtube search<br>  Metallicismymiddlename <br>  or<br>  Metalismymiddlename<br>  <br>  something like that ndd its a dude teaching you how to scream screamo songs :]|`|Q5GKWChoaa	Well, singing screamo is guaranteed to destroy your voice. <br>  <br>  Just open your mouth and go AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! really loudly.|`|QwRaFHZdaa	It has to do with your throat and also breathing too.  I would look it up on youtube or somethingg. I saw a video before on how to scream.|`|AlJ557gHaa	you scream|`|0344c2c0292060f2232027aa97515130aa	It just comes from your throat really. It's kinda of hard to explain.<br>  <br>  <br>     1. Make sure you have plenty of saliva at the back of your throat, but not so your breathing way is blocked. Similarly make sure you have no phlem.<br>     2. Start out with whispering with saliva at the back of the throat, to practice and make your voice crackly.<br>     3. As you get used to the feeling try different styles by narrowing or opening your throat more.<br>     4. Avoid closing your throat up too much. You can hurt your throat this way.<br>     5. Move the shape of your mouth. It adjusts the tone. Experiment with different shapes.<br>     6. Practice. Eventually you will get used to the feeling and can explore different types of screamo used by different bands like; Swing Kids, Orchid, Saetia, The Used, 36 Crazyfists, S.O.A.D, Escape the Fate and possibly my favorite screamo type bands Atreyu/Enter Shikari, Bring Me The Horizon, and Brokencyde for a good crunk feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      * Before screaming, warm up the vocal chords.<br>      * Drink plenty of water before, DURING and after.<br>      * Avoid beverages with high levels of acidity. Fizzy drinks make it harder to sing. Also avoid milk or other dairy products, it produces sticky mucus on the vocal chords making it harder to sing or scream.<br>      * Screaming, after getting used to the feeling, should come up to about the same level as your usual singing voice, the mic does the rest of the work. Remember you're using a mic, so you don't have to scream as loud you'd think, you can also cheat and "cup" the mic with your hands to help with the volume and sound.<br>      * Experiment with different kinds of mic cups for different scream sounds. You can put both hands around for a deeper sound, or you can cup with one hand and keep the mic next to your mouth. Just mess around with it!<br>      * When you get the hang of this, you will see someones head explode while singing this, don't worry, it's just because you nailed it perfect.|`|5UEugyzvaa	Okay my friend is in to all that stuff, I think it is alright. I like the band flyleaf. If anything you should listen to thier band, it is a girl. But my best guess is to scream, but with singing sorta. This probably doesnt help.|`|YHrVr9Jgaa	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... thats how|`|1MtZcCWKaa	rahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br>  idk loud and strain urself at first|`|5MbXjS1Iaa	Oh my gosh, I'm in the same situation.<br>  Just scream.

FZwhX62Xaa	There was a UK serialisation of a Gaskell book four of five years ago but you probably mean the 1980s US series about friends separated by the Civil War. Patrick Swayze and Kirstie Alley were among the stars.

AA11111233	Unfortunately, SharHo will always be the damsel in distress, always looking to men and using sex to make herself feel better.  The writers didn't create a good character in her to begin with.  She is incapable of change, and this meltdown of "regret" isn't going to grow her and make her all faithful and loving towards Nick so they live happily and cheat-free ever after.  Those who are expressively smart and level-headed will not believe that will ever happen.  Just like the bully who kicked you around in high school, she will always be wishy-washy and insecure, and her changing her ways|`|msUIsv8maa	Well who else on the show. hasnt slept around Sharon isnt the only one. if your gonna judge one judge them all|`|T6osHOwqaa	Well...I have always felt she never felt like she was good enough for Nick...his mom made sure of it.  She tried to hold her own but she was always trying to be someone she wasn't she tried to look down her nose too many times for me.  She was not this angel she tried to make herself.  She cheated/Nick cheated.  She left her family (on purpose) I haven't like her for years!!!<br>  <br>  Sleeping with Billy...no big deal...they will make it a HUGE deal when it's not....and now suddenly she's a kleptomaniac too.  SAD<br>  <br>  Why didn't Victor think of her for a board seat?  ohhh and how on earth did she had HOT sex with Billy and wake up in her bra and panties?|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I'm thinking... yes, the writers did change her because I was once a Sharon fan and now I cant stand her. <br>   I hate it how the writers can give a actor  story lines that ( I ) can so easily learn to  dislike them . How can one go from being a fan to a hater ?????|`|HK30PzNraa	I think the writers have turned her into a tramp.Its sad.Now she is also stealing things which is strange,I wish they would stop this story before it gets any worse.|`|b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	No, she's still a whore.  She has more nut in her than in a Snicker Bar.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I really just think she is going through something right now, I mean she had two husbands that done her wrong.  She is going through a meltdown right now.  Most of all I am getting really sick and tired of fans always calling Sharona a slut and that she is trying to destroy everyone relationship.  but nobody was there when she had gotten her heart broken and over again.|`|AA11714109	i don't think she is a damsel in distress. call it what it is she is a slut.sleeping around.how can she be so hard on jack and look at what she is doing.first nick now billy. who will she sleep with next.|`|KZV8p4PGaa	I think they had to change her.  She was getting boring.  I just think they went a little overboard though.  I can not stand her, where before she was just a little annoying,|`|WJW4qOlUaa	I think the writers done ruined her! I wish they would change her back! She sure has gotten a lil crazy and obsessed with things esp men!|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't think she's changed.

PpzKXnlEaa	There really isn't a difference.  The term 'philharmonic' refers to anything to do with a symphony orchestra.  It is just preference of the board when choosing a name for their newly formed orchestra.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Nothing - it is just a name. (And this question gets asked on a regular basis).|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	As the first answer says, nothing at all. The terms are sometimes used also to differentiate  between different orchestras in the same town or city. Thus London has a London Symphony Orchestra and a London Philharmonic Orchestra - two different organizations (and some may say with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, The Philharmonia Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, etc etc, far too many)

mD7eAAoNaa	Leo, I read is the only sign that can keep a free-spirited Sagittarius faithful.|`|gjNB9HtUaa	leos;*|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Leo is the most compatible for Sagittarius. They enjoy the same things and have a lot of things in common with each other.|`|E4bbZKaNaa	gemini supposedly|`|9MRSjkkxaa	aries are good with sags|`|wo1DGBo2aa	i'd say aries nd aquarius....|`|qoI6lrvZaa	well i'm a sagittarius and i have dated an aries and i am seeing a sag right now. Arians have hottt tempers but that is what makes them so sexy and appealing, they are the essence of FIRE! I find myself very flighty, as was he, this is why we never got very far because neither of us could stay on the same page long enough, we were always jumping ahead. I think gemini is the sign you will be most physically attracted <br>  1. because they are hott<br>  2. because they are sagittarians opposing sign<br>  Gemini accentuates the positive traits of sagittarius<br>  If you are looking for lasting love and stabilty then the sign of partnership, libra, would be your best bet. <br>  You could also try another sag if you are looking for understanding. Sometimes sags can only be understood by other sags.<br>  it all depends on what you find most important

aqOD8eJZaa	Of Course. Go to a store & ask him if they have the guitar & tell them you want to test it first. It may already be on display. That's how most guitars are sold.|`|91f9c1a082323a5a5a46fb06dbe20d0daa	Yes. I'm pretty sure they would. It isn't like you're going to put your mouth on it like for a wind instrument. I'm sure there isn't a problem w/ it. I've been to Sam Ash lots of times. They'll find a way to satisfy you.|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	yes, they will let you test the guitar in sam ash and guitarcenter

wCdILHl6aa	It was the first time that they were truly close. That Buffy trusted him enough to let him in for the first time. Their sex was meaningless, violent, Buffy hated Spike and herself during the entire time they were "together" in Season 6, and Spike knew, no matter how much he wanted her and loved her, she would never reciprocate. It was a very unhealthy relationship and they both knew it, but at the same time both needed that connection that they had during sex for their own selfish reasons. That one night was special and completely different from anything else that they shared up until that point that they both held it dear to their hearts and treasured that night they spent together, with their guards down and hearts more open to each other.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Because he tried to rape her and was hoping that if he was nice she'd forgive him and have sex with him again.|`|qOvF77Ndaa	Because during all their "hot sex sessions" buffy didnt even like him, she was just depressed and liked the pain their relationship caused her(weird i know but being brought back from death kinda messes you up). But during their "cuddling night" buffy trusted spike and even loved him to an extent, and he knew that. Spike had proven his love to Buffy, by getting a soul and changing into a champion, Before it had just been meaningless and selfish for her but now she saw him as more.|`|whR6j9JIaa	Because he was lying.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	because deep down, hes a big softie

q4XUy0Duaa	As much as I would love to think he would have blown up, I don't think he would have.  L's style was more appealing to an underground head.  His flows and delivery wouldn't appeal to the masses either.  The only reason he gets as much attention and respect as he does today is because he died.  Not to knock his skills, because I'll always consider him to be one of the nicest, but people jump on dead rappers d*cks for some reason.  I'm pretty sure he would have had a hit single like Cam'Ron, and that would be it.  Plus Rocafella isn't known for launching rapper's careers.  They're known for signing artists, and then f*ckin' up their vision, and eventually f*ckin' up their deal.  To date, I would say Jay Z was the only truly successful rapper out of Rocafella and it's his label.  A few others sold some records, but not nearly as many.|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	yes he was about to sign.|`|l72FO4eMaa	Sadly he was murdered 5 days before he was due to sign.

ibiO4VEQaa	1. I think she left Aaron with Claire's mother, Mrs. Hawking probably convinced Kate to go back, but the island is no place for a 3 year old, so she did the morally right thing.<br>  2. Ji Yeon is in Korea with Sun's mother. Not enough time to get her, and again, you should not bring a 3 year old to the island.<br>  3. He was at the docks were Penny and Little Charlie were, so he probably tried to kill her like he promised her father.<br>  4.He has no ties to the island, like the others, he's happy with his life, and wants to put the island behind him, but probably will go back if Penny's dead to kill Ben.<br>  5. Jin's part in that episode was a flashback, before the island, meant to make it look like Sun and Jin were both off the island, but it's only Sun.<br>  7. Looks like after Locke turned the wheel, the island and the left-behinds were sent to the 70's when DHARMA was on the island, so they joined them somehow.<br>  8. I think he did, to sacrifice himself to the island, but he might come back to life, like Jack and Claire's father, Christian did.<br>  9. Guy's name is Caesar and woman's name is Ileana, they will be more important then background cast, they are this seson's new characters. I think they are on the island in the 00's in regular time and the Losties will become the "2nd generation" of Others/DHARMA and stop them from leaving the island, like Ben did to the Losties in seasons 1-3.|`|I3CNklLKaa	1. Don't know<br>  2. With Sun's mum<br>  3. Someone beat him up again<br>  4. He promised Penny he wouldn't go back to the island<br>  5. It was a panda not a teddy and it was not for his own baby (or Sun's)<br>  6. It was a flash back<br>  7. Because his clothes were worn out and he like overalls<br>  8. I expect so - doubtless he will be resurrected on the island<br>  9. Don't know - I expect the writers need a couple of characters to bump off later.|`|HKHytNNQaa	I think Kate give Aaron to Aaron's grandma.<br>  <br>  and John Locke will come to life<br>  <br>  And I really wonder  all the questions|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	It was a good episode, not as good as last week's but still good!<br>  <br>  1)  Probably with Sun's mum<br>  2)  I think with Clare's mum<br>  3)  I don't know<br>  4)  He promised Penny he wouldn't, he also wasn't one of the 'Oceanic 6' so maybe he didn't need to be there<br>  5)  No, that was a flashback, it was one of those Lost red herrings that they like to throw in every now and again.  It was when he was working for Sun's father, and one of his business associates had had a baby and Jin was sent to give a present from Sun's father.<br>  6) Answered above<br>  7) I don't know, maybe they are all back in the time of the Dharma initiative, or maybe it's another red herring to tantalise us with!<br>  8) Probably, but being dead isn't an obstacle to being part of Lost really is it.<br>  9) I don't know, we don't really know if the plane crashed or if the white flash was something to do with what Sawyer and the others are experiencing.|`|Hj7fcbjzaa	I don't have answers for all of them...but here are my thoughts on a few.<br>  <br>  3 - In a previous episode, he told Whitmore that he would be sorry that he (Charles) had changed the rules.  (ie. Whitmore killed Ben's daughter, so Ben wants to kill Whitmore's daughter - Penelope).<br>  <br>  In this past episode, Ben told Jack he had to tie up a lose end with an old friend.  I think that Ben might have tried to kill Penny, and gotten a bit messed up in the process.  (Don't know whether or not Ben would have been successful).<br>  <br>  5 - I thought that Gin's baby thing was a flashback to the days before they arrived on the island....hence the fact that he was still working for Sun's dad.<br>  <br>  7- I think it's quite likely that the island is on a different time - in the past.  Perhaps Jin got a job with (or disguised himself as part of) Dharma now that he found himself in that time zone to try to get some answers about what they're doing.<br>  <br>  8 - I think Locke did kill himself, but he'll still be a character on the island somehow...either like Jack's dad - or some sort of time-related issue<br>  <br>  9 - They showed those people a few too many times for them to just be extras, so I think they'll end up on the island too.  No idea who they are though.|`|n0rJH0l6aa	1- I think that Kate may have left him with Charles Witmore to keep him away from Ben.<br>  2- Suns baby is definitely with her mother, she spoke to her on the phone. She probably left her because she was planning on killing Ben... not exactly the best thing to let your child see is it? :)<br>  3- Not quite sure, probably attacked by some of Witmores people.<br>  4- Not return from where?<br>  5- The Jin buying a teddy thing was a FLASH BACK to trick you into thinking that Jin was alive to see his baby, until the end when you discover it was for his bosses grandchild.<br>  6- I don't think it was a flash forward.<br>  7- I think that Jin and the others who have been flashing through time on the island are pretending to be Dharma initiative workers to try and discover how to stop the flashes.<br>  8- I dont think he did kill himself, nothing in Lost is that easy!<br>  9 - I think that they may also be on the island, yes, because otherwise they wouldn't have been highlighted. The woman with Sayid was a police officer taking Sayid with her, and the guy may have just been a random guy or he could even have some sort of connection with the island.|`|PkuWyQyOaa	the only one i have any theory watsoever on is your question 9, if u remember when kate first arrived on the island she to was bein escorted by a federal marshal and he died,to emulate the first time they landed,another marshal has now taken he's place so i can only assume the marshal will die and i think the other person is to somehow compensate for desmond not bein there????   just an initial theory lol,maybe u agree?maybe not|`|UuriOjdEaa	I have so many questions they want the fans to think i think john did kill him self and maybe aaron is with Claires mom maybe I REALLY WANT TO KNOW|`|AA10698189	Gave up on Lost a couple of seasons ago.

(she was on one of the previews episode so its easy to figure it out)<br>  2. with suns mum we also saw grandma sun call her doter in the previuse episode.<br>  3. he tried to kill windmores(don't think i spelled it right) daughter. we also saw that in previews episode (i think it was season 4 ending)<br>  4. he has a family to look after :)<br>  5. i think it was jin's past and suns future.<br>  6. the same answer as 5.<br>  7. thay were there for 3 ears so i think they took the close (i really don't know)<br>  8. yes he was told so so he would've done it (he loves the island more than ben)<br>  9. i don't know but the arab will be playing in the series i think, so will the women with sahid, so i think she will play too (and hope the season 1 kate incident won't be repeated)<br>   yeh so i think i deserve a best answer for all this writing

So the point of the video and song was really to mock bands like Nirvana and other bands like that at the time.

5qvIZCKXaa	Cancer might eventually understand Libra's romantic nature, but Cancer is too cautious to press indecisive Libra for the emotional response it needs. Disappointed at Libra's shallowness, Cancer turns sharply critical, and those crab-claws cut deep. Money-oriented Cancer is also annoyed by Libra's extravagance. Libra loves the glittering social life; Cancer is happiest in the warmth of its own home. Problems might be solved in time, but the wait usually isn't worth it.|`|awLQeRkMaa	no I dated a libra ended really bad.|`|JvbvGtrBaa	ok libra girl involved with a cancer male 3 yrs going on 4<br>  <br>  oi when it's good it's good<br>  he can be romantic, he will be there for you. he may date you at first going out places however he will feel he has nothing left to prove and discontinue going out on the town or to parties. especially if you move in with him.<br>  roadtrips will be hell. going anywhere on vacation you two half the time will argue about trivial shitt like his moodswings. hes horrible at gift giving you have to tell him what you want but at least you get what you want! he'll cave in and do his best to provide what you need.<br>  in the bedroom it won't be passionate it will be compassionate. <br>  hes prolly not going to lick your ear hold up against the wall and but he will experiment as long as he thinks hes ring the freaky one.<br>  he likes to be seduced when hes ready otherwise it's dirty. <br>  you'll most likely get reallly effin bored outta your gored. you two will have no social life. traveling isn't on his list of top priorities<br>  he keeps his friends few and close for life. they prolly won't be compatible with you and your need to be socialized will suffocate in his watery grave. <br>  he simply does not understand or even try to understand your need to go out on weekends and holidays. this may cause issues, and both of you will suffer. he loves his mom and will stay very close to her probebly not even moving out of the same neighborhood<br>  that might drive you crazy if your not very attachted to parentals.<br>  he likes to stay at home and sulk you will not get this and neeed to get out he does not get this either. <br>  you both understand the world from a different point of  view it will never be that easy. as time goes by it's going to get harder and harder <br>  especilly if mr.right walks into the libras life at wrong time. as shes flirty romantic and flighty she loves to be swept off feet and is allways looking at greener pastures. it's in her nature she can't help it.  on the other hand he is loyal dependable will be there for you no matter what you can count on that! <br>  both of you love art, you two appretiate happy pretty home. if you can communicate, forgive, and accept eachother differences you can make it work but it's not easy at times <br>  you will both feel like walking away at some point if may be easier for you.<br>  he is emotional and you intellectual, both are sensitive tho so theres will theres a way. you are a bit shallow for his tastes but you are honest and once a friend a friend for life. which is good enough<br>  g'luck|`|326pQEbSaa	I find in real life Libras and Cancers or Pisces find an attraction to each other.  The real challenge is Libra connects through ideas (air) while Cancer or Pisces connect through emotion (water).  There is a different wavelength here.  There possibly might be a undercurrent of irritation.  Libra can be unintentionally undercutting in communication due to their seeing both sides of an issue and Cancer and Pisces want to be heard and not debated with their communication.  I am a Pisces, and eventually I learned to withdraw my communication towards Libra.  Cancer possibly will have a better time "debating" than a Pisces.  Pisces can see ALL around an issue (like an elder = from experience), we may seem wishy-washy or elusive however it is because "some things" in life are not really worth debating (our inner essence is spiritual).  Cancer can be "snippy" with what seems like trivial comments.<br>  <br>  There can be life lessons learned here; communication in all relationship is key.  There is one thing I've learned is, even though we understand the English language, we all "perceive" the words differently.  That is where the confusion lies.<br>  <br>  Libra and Cancer are in some ways are polar opposites, and on the other hand (Libra :)) both have a soft, gentleness that is enduring.  If Libra can show verbal vulnerability and Cancer can "shore" their emotions, it can be fun.|`|1JyDUf1maa	Funny i stumbled across this. <br>  <br>  I'm in this situation right now were my friend Libra(girl) and im cancer(boy) there's always been some flirting but we kind of only got down to chatting about trying a relationship out last week.<br>  ( ( we were sober ;] ) )<br>  <br>  We haven't done anything although ive tried for a kiss without success and tried to to be affectionate again that failed. It seems to be as effective as banging my head against a brick wall. <br>  <br>  Im not a star sign fanatic or anything but i really don't think its going to work out. she seems very in-closed, holding back emotion / affection.<br>  <br>  Im really disappointed i like-d her alot but it seems ridiculous how in-closed she has been and kinda off putting. It gets to the point of orquardness at times because she wont open up and show me if there's any emotion or affection inside!!!

There really is not a single track that is skippable on here, granted it is only 10 tracks (9 real tracks because of the intro) but all the tracks are top-notch.<br>  <br>  When asking people what their favorite track from the album is, asking 10 different people could give 10 different answers. That, to me, is why the album is so great. Everyone has their own personal favorite track, and that is something special.|`|rjH6Hfbuaa	Illmatic is pure hip-hop from start to finish. There are very few guest appearances and the lyrics are very fresh. Nas was speaking from experience and he portrays the "hood" life in songs like "N.Y. State of Mind" without being too preachy and keeping good flow. Although the others are good, Illmatic will always stand above the rest|`|9vjxfIkYaa	Illmatic and i think ready to die is the most overrated rap cd. i think nas would rap circles around biggie. he only gets soo much props cus hes dead. if nas died instead people would be on his dick.|`|93lz4HLxaa	Illmatic is the best album ever.  In any genre not just rap its because all the songs on there are great.  Each one is a hit|`|1q6l2demaa	Illmatic because there is no filler. Nas is the most lyrical rapper who can deliver his raps with heat.|`|nX2pSke8aa	what  in  the  world  are  you  talking  about.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	1)All Eyez on Me<br>  2)Reasonable Doubt<br>  3)Ready to Die<br>  4)Illmatic<br>  5)The Chronic|`|3oUSroiZaa	Ready to Die|`|l7fiAHRLaa	Illmatic is above the rest, its just flawless while All Eyez on Me had to much filler/guests, Ready to Die lacked coherency,  The Chronic sounds dated if you know what I mean, has that 90s sound, and Reasonable Doubt is just kind of overrated.<br>  <br>  I listen to Ready to Die more then any of them though.|`|sVzf9w8Haa	Ready To Die > Illmatic > Reasonable Doubt > All Eyez On Me > The Chronic.|`|jzKJDrEWaa	Illmatic .. then Reasonable Doubt|`|zThIaO0Qaa	all eyez on me....tupac nuff said =]
qThmcR1Aaa	Carrie Underwood is very pretty. I'll put Taylor Swift a close second.<br>  <br>  Kellie Pickler is nice to look at, but she is as dumb as a bag of rocks. Look her up on YouTube, where she was on that "Are You Smarter Than a Firth Grader" show. Oh, God, it's embarrassing. <br>  <br>  For me, "hotness" includes intelligence ... at least some modicum of intelligence, anyway. So she's a distant third.|`|KlCHU6OGaa	kellie by far carrie looks fake and shoot taylor she looks like a rat looking of a piece of cheese|`|kWOWrtA0aa	Um KELLIE PICKLER !!! by faaaaaaar.|`|s5kxh86Baa	talor swift|`|nVQqTPIFaa	It's a 3 way tie.|`|hgTT5LrSaa	Lol.. I wouldn't use the term "hotter" but I think Carrie Underwood is very pretty. :)|`|AA12103453	Well Kellie Pickler was before the haircut, she looked hot in her first video. After that I'd probably have to say Taylor Swift. I never saw Carrie Underwood look hot, more plain or slutty(in an attempt to look sexy I think).
XVGmGCDaaa	Libra & Leo<br>  Eloquent, artistic, and honest, these two signs share many touchstones and easily accommodate each other elsewhere. The Libran individual, incurably wishy-washy, will adopt the Lion's determination if it seems fair. And the Lion laps it up! Leo fulfills the Libran's desires, rubbing him or her the right way and expressing boundless love, especially in the physical sense. Friends and lovers, Leo and Libra derive strength from each other to parade splendidly, in dignity and grace, through the outer world. Their love is an intelligent device.
c0XomxxEaa	Pisces male tend to be attracted to me, Im an aries.. but a very feminine one at that (girly). They like girly girls.. but I think pisceans would be attracted to fire signs like aries because there very dominate.. and pisces like someone just to take control in the insignificant things in life sometimes.. there very submissive.<br>  moon sign is aries too and my rising is taurus and venus in aries|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Scorpio (always a disaster), Taurus, Libra (always cheat), but right now a virgo.|`|8315887d554145b1a660159c25969950aa	I seem to be attracted to aries<br>  <br>  Pisces Sun<br>  Libra Rising<br>  Aquarius Moon|`|QLOCznKTaa	I seem to be more attracted to Taurus's and other Pisces...I don't know why but thats what does it for me|`|eT6SsCaraa	lol *highfives* :D<br>  <br>  Anyway...

N1stgM5Aaa	In Japanese history, a ninja is a warrior specially trained in a variety of unorthodox arts of war. These include assassination, espionage, and various martial arts.<br>  <br>  The role of the ninja may have included sabotage, espionage, scouting and assassination as a method of destabilization or to cause social chaos. Such actions may have taken place at the service of a feudal lord or other entity waging guerilla warfare.<br>  <br>  But I'm sure ninja's were just normal people. I mean they didn't possess any abilities or powers -- they were just normal dudes looking to kill people with awesome assassination methods ^_^|`|JKQGy2aZaa	ninjas r just assassins and/or spies they dont have anyspecial powers<br>  thier just skilled in fighting and a few othere things <br>  <br>  NARUTO IS NOT REALLY|`|Hiasgb75aa	No. Ninjas were just assassins and/or spies. Their only real ability was to go about unseen when doing a mission. They probably did it by staying hidden in the shadows but I don't think they possessed the abiity to teleport, turn invisible, etc.|`|3OYv4dnSaa	In Japanese history (where ninjas come from), they do not possess abilities like teleport or invisibility. Those abilities are just fantasy that people make up.<br>  <br>  They are "hard to see" because they usually carry smoke bomb to escape and sand-filled bombs to blind enemies. At night, they usually wear black outfit to blend within the shadow.<br>  <br>  Ninjas also usually wear a special type of footwears with "slit-toe" style that improves gripping and rope/wall climbing. They are soft so it is hard to be heard, virtually silent.<br>  <br>  And, as everyone else said, they specialize in assassination (since they're difficult to be noticed) and as well as scouting and stealing/kidnapping. They're usually good martial artists and carry weapons like shurikens for distraction. However, shurikens (in actuality) are barely used.|`|IRUZYIoXaa	it all depends that what in the old times that people though that other people had such abilities but if it was in modern day society nobody has it <br>  but i think they dont have it|`|iWXQH1Jeaa	Ninjas are just assassins who stayed in the shadows. Of course they didn't possess powers because there is no such thing as magic.
IX4mSxEMaa	LOTS OF SPOILERS HERE  I've seen all including the ending movie so here's pairings I know for sure worked out... to certain extent.  Oh even though I try to stay spoiler free, I can't so don't read if you want absolutely no spoiler.<br>  <br>  1.  Tenma/Karasuma (was there ever any doubt that Tenma only likes Karasuma?  Harima never had a chance as much as a lot of Harima fans wanted it to work for Harima)<br>  <br>  2.  Mikoto/Hanai (Let's get this straight, Yakumo never will accept Hanai so Hanai more or less gave up trying in earnst, but he still occassionally make pursueing Yakumo behavior out of habit.  I will touch on Asou/Mikoto later)<br>  <br>  3.  Karen/Imadori (was pretty much cliched when Imadori found Karen being so familiar with Douchibiron that she can actually act out Douchibiron parts based on episodes and recite the lines)<br>  <br>  <br>  MAJOR SPOILER For pairings that's definitely there, but never worked out (and was confirmed in the movie)<br>  <br>  1. Harima/Tenma (Tenma revealed that she was only pretending not knowing Harima's crush on her because she only has eyes for Karasuma)<br>  <br>  2. Harima/Eri or Harima/Yakumo (Movie said Eri gave up on Harima when Yakumo beat her in confessing her feelings to Harima.  As for Yakumo, she confessed her feelings knowing Harima will not accept her because she already know Harima is in fact in love with her sister... she just wanted to tell Harima and have a real closure for her feelings)<br>  <br>  3. Asou/Mikoto (Movie implied that Asou and Mikoto did give it a go, but the relationship went no where so they parted on friendly terms)<br>  <br>  4. Asou/Sarah (As far as Sarah is concerned, she really is taking the whole going into the convent to become a nun very seriously so no, she does not really allow herself to actually "fall" for anyone in the end)<br>  <br>  5 Imadori/Lala (No offense to fans of this pairing, but it never is going to work.  In fact even after Imadori and Karen become a steady couple, Lala still tries her hardest to interfere because Lala considers Karen to be her equal, but Imadori as her inferior, so she thought Karen could have done a whole lot better than going out with Imadori... however if Karen was ever potentially going to get hurt by Imadori's unthinking action/words, Lala still also beats Imadori up for potentially hurting Karen, so I guess she also does want them to split up but not really)|`|Hiasgb75aa	1. I agree<br>  <br>  2. I don't agree. Eri may like Harima but Harima hates Eri, Yakumo and Harima would make a nice pair but Harima REALLY likes Tenma<br>  <br>  3. Maybe<br>  <br>  4. I agree<br>  <br>  5. I haven't seen much chemistry. I personally thought there was more with Asou and Mikoto|`|fNL89L5vaa	I couldn't have said it better ^_^<br>  I would give you ten points if I could ;)

xi9amEG2aa	Hmmm....I haven't heard of half of those bands, but I do like Evanescence and she does a song with Seether called Broken and she also does one with Korn called Freak on a Leash. So if you don't already have those two songs, get them....although they might be hard to find, I had to have a friend download them for me and send them to me in an email and then I put them on my phone haha....I couldn't find them. But anyways....here's a list of some of my favorite bands and a couple of my favorite songs from each :)<br>  <br>  -- Papa Roach: Sometimes, Scars, Roses on my Grave<br>  -- Disturbed: Remember, Voices, and pretty much their whole Indestructible cd (which just came out in '08)<br>  -- Buckcherry: Too Drunk, Rescue Me, Don't Go Away<br>  -- Hinder: Pretty much their latest cd, Take it to the Limit (which recently came out)<br>  -- Nickelback: Something In Your Mouth, Gotta Be Somebody, Follow You Home, Animals<br>  -- Rev. Theory: Hell Yeah, Light it Up<br>  -- Saving Abel: Addicted, 18 Day<br>  -- Shinedown: Devour, The Sound of Madness, Second Chance, The Crow and the Butterfly, If You Only Knew, Call Me, 45, I Dare You, Heroes, Save Me<br>  -- Staind: Schizophrenic Conversations, Devil, Believe, All I want<br>  -- Three Days Grace: Riot, It's All Over, Never Too Late, Let It Die, One - X<br>  -- Trapt: Headstrong, Echo, Stories, Still Frame, Hollowman, Disconnected (Out of Touch), Waiting, Stand Up, Wasteland, Who's Going Home With You Tonight, Contagious<br>  <br>  Those are mostly in the Rock genre, some are a little heavier than others :)<br>  <br>  ****  I was going to put this on your other question but as I was about to post it I saw the additional details and I just have to say......<br>  <br>  OMG!!!  I just love TSO!!  It's like a yearly thing for me and my boyfriend to go see them when they start their winter tour in Youngstown, OH at the Chevrolet Centre!  If you haven't seen a live show from them, it's well worth it.
84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Good question <br>  Tropical is the older one and I believe Sidereal is the new one. <br>  It is possible that they can both be correct and you can have the same personality but with different planets. <br>  Also, it also depends on personal preference. <br>  I go by tropical, not sidereal, and plus, most astrologers go my tropical.|`|4dgrwFU4aa	Sidereal is more correct by observation of current sky phenomena, tropical more correct by current practice of  astrology. This is because of the precession of the vernal equinox. The two schools may be headed for convergence under the influence of Ophiuchus the 13th sign.
JqqRFFsyaa	They're melodic death metal. ALL their songs have screaming. So I'm afraid not. I love CoB. Hang in there, though.

sc4BtGxGaa	I am sure you can access the syllabus for ABRSM or RCM - I am American, and I did it to make a database for a flute literature project I was working on.<br>  <br>  Be aware that these student contest lists are just THAT - for students.  Just because you have hit the highest level in THAT list, does not mean you can play the hardest literature for that instrument.  I am a NYSSMA judge in NY, a sometimes students think that if they hit Level 6, they are at the TOP of classical music.  Guess again.  The list is designed to have works at the top that would be challenging for an accomplished high school student, or one who is entering a music school - but they are hardly the end of the trolley line.<br>  <br>  There are other independent graded lists of literature for each instrument, assembled by recognized pedagogues or committees.  The Hinson book for piano is such a volume, and the National Flute Association list is one for flute, obviously.

Im1Wpr7taa	Yeah it's worth it. It's helpful when your playing shows because you can stay on your clean channel and switch to distortion without having to walk over to your amp. You can also get lots of different sounds using one. I recommend the Boss Ds1 distortion pedal.|`|BZ9J8k9Gaa	Yes, it good to have a pedal and  a distortion pedal is good for beginners. I have one. You can get one for twenty dollars. Some amps come with the effect on it. Most rock songs have guitars with distortion.|`|zfadjiJVaa	Well it kind of depends on if you want to play hard or soft rock.

XVGmGCDaaa	Sagittarius & Sagittarius<br>  A pair of world travelers with an intellectual bent, they range far and wide in quest of spiritual or physical adventure, with an unsinkable optimism. Explorers, philosophers, athletes: they spend their life on the road and enjoy a vigorous discussion. As for the nest, or putting down roots, neither partner deems such goals worthy of attention. They'd be happy to live in a tent all their lives; often, their home is just a transfer point. They spend one night there and then set off in quest of new discoveries. But this enthusiastic and curious couple has the key to its own happiness.|`|awLQeRkMaa	<a href="http://www.sexualastrology.com/sexual_compatibility_sagittarius_sagittarius.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexualastrology.com/sexual_co...</a>|`|QZzQdh43aa	When two Sagittarius individuals get together, it means only one thing - lots and lots of fun and excitement. The companionship between them will be great. As to the compatibility of their love relationship, it doesn't seem to be too bad either. Both the individuals love to travel, explore new places and new people and go on new adventures. Sitting at the same place for too long makes them restless and then, they again set out for another adventure. As partners, two Sagittarians will share the optimism towards life and love for enthusiasm.<br>  <br>  With their progressive outlook on life, they are definitely going to attain some new heights in life. However, to attain this, either of them will have to show a little seriousness towards life. A lively life, with lots of variety and explorations, seems to be very fascinating. But, it is also necessary to have the feet firmly planted on the ground. A Sagittarius is quite philosophical and if his partner does not share the same ideology, problems may arise. If both of them are very straightforward, they seldom get hurt while facing the truth themselves also. <br>  <br>  The similarity of temperaments is another positive feature of this zodiac match that will strengthen its compatibility. Both of them are extremely sociable and love to interact with new people, of either sex. And since they share this trait also, there will be no jealousy on either part, as they know that the flirtation is totally harmless. A Sagittarius is totally independent and loves his freedom. But, they will have to make sure that this free spirit does not make them drift too far from each other. <br>  <br>  Challenges interest them and they are game for a new experiment all the time. Both have a need for an intelligent partner, with whom they can have satisfying conversations, and there will be no problems in this aspect too. However, when they get together, the frivolity may become too much. If either of them does not make efforts to bring some gravity in the other, the relationship has all the chances of remaining superficial only. Apart from that, almost everything is just perfect.

All it seems to be about is sex and drugs. It's no wonder we are growing up to be morally unsound people with that type of influence.<br>  And the thing about rap is that it is not really music, but poetry. You are right when you say there is no voice. It's just a guy talking really fast, with the occasional repetition of the same few words in the chorus.<br>  I could never be bothered to concentrate enough to decipher what the lyrics are, and this probably contributed to it not being my favourite choice of music.<br>  <br>  And to all the people dissing this guy, you are just proving the type of influence rap music has had on you.|`|7PS3fSSPaa	I like lyricism which is a form of rap but most people like you dont like it cause its to complicated for simple minded lazy people "no offense"lol|`|haxPqmIgaa	rap on the radio is way different than REAL rap. listen to you never know by immortal technique.... theres voice|`|zp8gLEz8aa	you probably only hear artists like lil wayne and soulja boy.<br>  <br>  pfft, i hate them too.|`|xlMCbsNmaa	fckkkk youu(:|`|5B6w8mxVaa	everyone has their own taste in music.|`|KasoBuBbaa	RAP HATES YOU....NOW DO US ALL A FAVOR AND GO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE.|`|Ho9WQKCxaa	ya fo sho

5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	Yes, mellow jazz is great for sleeping because its interesting AND mellow. It brings you into a peaceful state of mind where all the instruments are cooperating.<br>  <br>  I used to be a preschool teacher. I made nap time cds of mostly jazz instrumentals. They were great. <br>  <br>  Most jazz albums are not completely mellow all the way through. I know of a few that are (some are collections). I will list some below. I'm very familiar with these albums, and I promise you that they are mellow.<br>  <br>  Dexter Gordon- Ballads. Very mellow music. Dexter had a big tone on his tenor sax, and it was perfect for mellow ballads.<br>  <br>  Kenny Burrell- Midnight Blue. Perfect title for the music on this album<br>  <br>  Stan Getz For Lovers. A collection of mellow Getz tunes.<br>  <br>  Ben Webster For Lovers.<br>  <br>  I hope you try one of these albums because I'm pretty sure it will help you sleep.<br>  <br>  PS- Kava tea is really good for sleep.|`|eVLdx9GQaa	I am so inspired that you have asked this question!<br>  Let me just begin by saying I AMMM the type of person who enjoys long walks on the beach. I like the wind in my hair, the wide open spaces! How can such beauty be unknown to the common world? My favorite word of all time is, "Play." the four most wonderous letters in the alphabet into one word that speaks numerous joys out to the crys of youth and childhood. Oh, did i mention my names Hildegard Alexandra Robusk? I was voted most likely to die alone in the year 2008. And let me just say, I have not died. And I... am alone. I am the complete OPPOSITE of the word platitudinous. I've had a crush on Bill Nye ever since I first saw him on my 2nd grade video. I wish to marry that young lad. I have 4 cats, all named after my grand ancestors. One named Bertha, Jilusephit, Gredle, and Sniffles. Sniffles was my great great great great great grandma and since they couldn't speak fluent sentences, her name was Sniffles.<br>  Ive recently painted all the walls in my house gray, to match my exuberant personality!<br>  And in conclusion- i litsen to jazz music every night and that has made me this way. so if you want to be like me! litsen to jazz music|`|DwinhfBraa	Yeah it does, but you have to set the volume low or you can't sleep.|`|0UqOwLCjaa	Metal makes me sleep.

Use an hour sleep button so it turns off in an hour.|`|8CCttFS6aa	Maybe a bluesy jazz. A bebop certainly wouldn't.<br>  I listen to classical indian music to sleep. A lot of Ravi Shankar, sitar music. Try it, it's relaxing.|`|VN8hoKgzaa	yeees, you might also try classical. But jazz is definitely better!!!|`|LLqTeW70aa	yes modern slow jazz with loooong solos.

I think we old do.  well it depends.|`|d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	No, definitely not!<br>  Im an Aries and this is what i see in a Gemini<br>  <br>  Gemini is 2-sided. Some1 who can be very passionate, sexual, generous to the person they love. Also they can be very petty & egoistic esp towards the pple they care most. They tend to hide their true feelings & may even say harsh words & lie when they gets upset, to hide their weaker side.<br>  <br>  Gemini is also poor at social communication. They might talk 1st b4 using their brain. They r not sensitive to other pple's feelings, therefore often been misread as a self-centered & mean person. Gemini doesn't like fighting, even tho they need to fight for themselves. At the end of the scenario, i often see Gemini as someone who will try diff ways to make up with the one they loves.<br>  <br>  Making up with Gemini is quite an enjoyable feeling. They want harmony & will love to see the pple ard them to be happy. Even tho they may make hurting jokes, their intention is not to be sarcastic & hurt others. They will try to help or at least show some concern if they see some1 ard them down.<br>  <br>  This is my opinion in a Gemini, hope others will agree with me :-)

I'm with a wonderful man now who absolutely worships the ground I walk on.  Awwwww...|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I dated a cancer for 4 years, he was emotionally and verbally abusive.  It wouldn't have really surprised me if he turned physical.  He had a very bad temper and was very manipulative.|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Although I've never been in a situation like this, I thank you for asking this question. I'm glad that you, tiacola, and deb are okay.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Well since I just answered your other question on abuse, I hope you don't mind if I just my answer from there, here. I hate and yes I truly mean HATE abusive people because they don't take responsibility for their own actions. In their minds, the person that they're beating "deserves" it and had it coming. That's their way of excusing and justifying their despicable behavior.<br>  <br>  My mom married a fat abusive piece of sh*t when I was 7 and I found out later that he beat all of his former wives and their children. Not that it matters but he was a Cancer. He was extremely abusive to me, my brother, and later to my mom. He broke my brother's nose once and used to hit me with electrical cords, wooden brushes, anything that would hurt. He was a horrible person and got off on torturing people. I think abusive people come in all signs. These are people with issues that are probably continuing a cycle of abuse that was passed down to them from their parents. Sometimes these types of people have never been abused by anyone but have massive anger issues and instead of turning that anger inward and dealing with it, it's easier for them to take it out on others. They'll find any excuse to expel that anger onto the world instead of accepting that they have inner problems that they need to deal with. At any rate, there's NO excuse for it. I couldn't do anything about it then cause I was a kid but if any man were to lay his hands on me now he would end up in the hospital I swear.<br>  <br>  <br>  Awwww Princess Deb :(  {{{{{{{HUGS}}}}}}} I'm glad you came through that alive. I bet you're a much stronger woman for it :)<br>  <br>  Thanks Cheezy :) and screw whoever gave you a td.|`|MtANnIlfaa	Not an abusive Cancer, but an abusive Pisces. I was with him for two years.. the first six months were heavenly.. then he changed drastically. At first i use to hit him back because i would not allow him putting his hands on me.. but that made things worse. Back then i had an Aquarius best friend and she use to cry everytime she saw me with bruises and cuts.. I had a lot of cousins that looked for him all the time to beat the crap out of him (including girl cousins).. I dont know why i put up with his crap? I think i was just really naive.

I do remember one time when it was me, him, and some of our friends and I was talking to a male friend of mine. We were joking around and just having a conversation and my Cancer ex was listening/watching the whole time. He said later that I needed to have my bones broken to teach me a lesson. I broke up with him after that but I'm pretty sure that he would have tried to hit me or something if it happened again. he was really insecure and he didn't have enough of a social life outside of us to have me having male friends and be okay with it without being all over me|`|qJU0S0Skaa	my moms ex was abusive and a cancer...i see them and taurs men as the most abusive|`|R1Fc344laa	two words: GARY BUSEY

They rely on advertising revenue, and that has decreased, substantially because of Google and the economy.  We are getting something for free; so, they have to up the amount of advertising, but at a lower dollar rate.

The single failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 when it was released in the U.S. in 2005, however, the song proved to be a success on the R&B charts, peaking at #36, Ne-Yo's first single to do so as a solo artist.<br>  <br>  In the UK, "Stay" was due to be released as the third single from In My Own Words.

aqOD8eJZaa	I'm not sure he if he uses that effect. ,but he uses these:<br>  <br>  the Ultrasonic amp model in Native Instruments’ Guitar Rig 3. The amp settings are: Master 8; Volume 7; Gain 10; Bass 4; Middle 3; Treble 10; and Presence 9. The cabinet is an Ultrasonic 4x12 with the Mic A/B setting pushed all the way over to B. The Dry/Air setting is at 1.5.<br>  <br>  Now we start to get into the pieces that will actually shape the overall crunch that Donegan uses. Instead of using a regular distortion pedal, we are going to use something a bit heavier to give us that heavy top end that you typically hear in his riffs.<br>  he chose a Demon Distortion with Volume 4; Bass 8; Mid 4; Treble 7; and Gain 8. added a quad delay with some very low settings; just enough to add something to the back end, but not interfere with the tone while you're playing. Quad Delay settings are Dry/Wet 4.9%; Time 56 ms; Feedback 24.5%; Rate 0.71Hz; and Depth 4.95.<br>  <br>  Lastly, he adds a Phaser with Rate 0.24Hz; 1.52; and color 0.73. he also put in a Cry Baby Wah that you can use as well.<br>  <br>  With those settings and a high gain guitar, you have a great starting point for playing Don Donegan’s seriously disturbed songs.|`|kILkOc6saa	I think they use overdrive, actually...|`|Lk0noY62aa	To **** if I know but check out these riffs-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xHmarS0Isg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xHmarS0I...</a>

JwGwUcCsaa	I think you misunderstood the Joker a little bit, but that okay.  The Joker wanted chaos because he wanted to show that world that with a little motivation, everyone can be a murderer, and everyone can be just like him.  Thats why he did the boat stunt thinking one of them would blow the other up.  That is also why he ruined Harvey Dent because harvey is know Two-face, a murderer.  The Joker is just described by Alfred as "some men just want to watch the world burn."<br>  <br>  how is this true to Batman is a confusing question.  Batman believes that the people ar good and will make the right decison with just a little push.  Thats why he hopes to stop being Batman with Harvey as the mayor.  Batman believes the chaos will stop with the right leader.<br>  <br>  Harvey was changed by the chaos Joker gave him.  He believes the only fair thing is chance, hence the reason for the coin.  He believes that the chance is only fair, and not chaos.  <br>  <br>  Just throwing this in there, i liked the quote:<br>  "You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villian."- its good to think about<br>  <br>  (ps, if this was homework, like the first guy said, you have an awsome teacher giving Batman as an assignment)

ISljRZIRaa	no its not. There's 7 seasons and the 7th one ended in 2003. They still make comics though to this day. Its my favorite show!!! God, I've watched every season about 50 times. I watched it on Surfthechannel and it has pretty much every episode. It just gets annoying to have to watch it on the internet. Surfthechannel just provides the links to other sites with the video. The best ones are megavideo and Tudou (if they are listed). Its such an awesome show and hopefully you'll get just as addicted as I am lol. You could also try the series "Angel" when your done with Buffy ;)<br>  <br>  Here is the link exactly to the episodes on Surfthechannel: <br>  <a href="http://surfthechannel.com/show/29.html" rel="nofollow">http://surfthechannel.com/show/29.html</a>|`|O3tUgZ7naa	Not theres just reruns but they have the seasons you can buy

My favorite is Ouran host club though because the drawing style is most original, and the animation is just so cute its hard not to love it!(in my opinion) and its just a little bit more complicated. I guess you could also say code geass has some romance and comedy in it but it also has a lot of action, and same with soul eater(except not so much romance) hope i helped XD

Xr7NvDP8aa	Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac and is represented by the scales. Libra is the only sign that is not represented by a human or animal, but the scales signify the Libra's need for balance, order, and equality. Many astrologers view Libra as the most enviable sign because it occurs during the peak of the year when the rewards of hard work are harvested.<br>  <br>  Libras are very easy to like because of their charming ways. They are capable of making anyone feel interesting and important. They are great listeners, but they also expect you to listen to them in return. They have great observation skills and very good perception. They strive to bond with others and Libras are at their best when in personal relationships.<br>  <br>  Appreciators of Beauty<br>  Because Venus, the goddess of love, rules Libras, they appreciate beauty in anything, whether it is a person, art, or music. Because Libras love and appreciate beauty, their homes are often filled with exquisite and attractive items. They enjoy owning the best money can buy and take pride in their good taste. Because of their affection for beauty, Libras make great designers, artists, and musicians.<br>  <br>  Sensitive<br>  Libras are very charming, but part of their charm is in their sensitivity to others. They are great at seeing and delivering what other people need to pick them up. They dislike cruelty, nastiness, and vulgarity, as they are naturally gentle and loving people. Born diplomats, they often try to settle conflicts between people as this upsets them to see clashes occur. Libras themselves try to cooperate and compromise with everyone around them to help create a tranquil atmosphere.<br>  <br>  The sensitivity Libras possess helps them be aware of not only their position on a subject, but also that of others. This along with their listening skills and willingness to compromise makes for great relationships. Even if a Libra does fight with a mate, their charisma and kindness always helps smooth things over. Because Libra is the most empathetic of all signs, the spouse of a Libra will always feel like his or her feelings are understood.<br>  <br>  Weaknesses<br>  With all their caring and kind ways, it may be hard to imagine Libras as having negative aspects to their personality, but as with all other signs, they can. Libras do not handle criticism very well, which often makes them seem insecure. But one of their biggest faults is the need for admiration. They like to be the center of attention and be praised for things they do, so some may see them as self-centered.<br>  <br>  Because a Libra values beauty so much, they may sometimes become too focused on outward beauty and forget to look deeper into a person's full character.<br>  <br>  Because they are so understanding of other's feelings, they may be seen as indecisive or unable to make up their minds. Any sign as blessed with charm as Libras are can always be seen as flirtatious.<br>  <br>  Parts of the Body Ruled by Libra<br>  Lower back, buttocks, and kidneys - Libras may suffer from problems in the lumbar area and may be prone to kidney infections and kidney stones.|`|n2DfXIwcaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhhJB7UlAOZbOxsKNo9AHYHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225090001AA31EQ7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|r6oaBPhiaa	<a href="http://sasstrology.com/libra-man-woman" rel="nofollow">http://sasstrology.com/libra-man-woman</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://sasstrology.com/2007/04/why-did-libra-turn-cold.html" rel="nofollow">http://sasstrology.com/2007/04/why-did-l...</a><br>  <br>  very helpful|`|xYqrCYuFaa	All my libra friends are very easy to get along with<br>  they're kinda extroverted and are VERY carefree<br>  but the rest of your chart plays a large role of your personality <br>  :]

And is your aunt strict? The uninvited is really scary (I want to see it too!) and if you dont like scary movies, well...you know the answer. this guy probably will get close to you during the movie and idk if your confortable with that. just ask your aunt: "Can I go to the movies with my friend?" or "Aunty, I really like this movie and my friend asked me to go see it with them, can I go?" Hope this helps! xoxo|`|qc7ogQcLaa	Don't do it man!

fNL89L5vaa	This is basic, but i hope it will still be usefull. I found it works really good. <br>  <br>  First, sit down or lay down on your back, relax, breath and all that e.t.c associated with meditation. As you breath, try to think of roots extending from your base chakra, down into the earth. When you breath out, the roots expand, get,s deeper and deeper into the earth, as you breath in, you suck up sparkling energy from the earth and into you. Keep doing this for a while untill you start to feel like electricity in your palms. <br>  <br>  Then, think of the element air, say to yourself, i summon air, think of the wind, a breeze, a breeze throught your hair.. in your face.. <br>  Now think of a sea with it,s surface toutched by the air.. Say, i summon you water, think of decending into the water. Sink deeper and deeper into it, feel no fear, let the water reveal intuitive pictures to you. Keep on sinking, extend your feet,s and feel how they reach the bottom of the sea. Say, i summon you earth, then sink throught the bottom of the lake down into the earth. Feel it,s impact, feel how grounded you are. Like a rock in there. Sink deeper and deeper into the earth. The earth get,s hotter, say i summon you fire, and think how you sinks down into lava, the inner fury of the earth. As you feel settled.. try to imagine a volcano eruption.. you fly all the way up into the air. Summon air again... this time, try to yell in yourself.. i summon you air!.. but it.s hard to hear your own whoice, the wind is a hurricane.. Go down into the sea to escape the fury of the wind, feel how quiet it is, all your sences get,s very sharp. Keep on sinking untill you reach the bottom again. Feel how firm the bottom is compared to free floating in water, the bottom is rock hard. You sink down into it as you now are harder then the bottom, you feel like a bronze statue, firm. You sink throught the floor.. into the earth. This time the heat is so intence the bronze melts away, the inner of the earth is again a raging inferno. It,s so full of energy and intensity that the lava feels vibrating. The walls wibrate.. Now, focus on yourself, you are surounded by a storm of the elements, you are in the middle, you are ether, the spirit. You are full of energy, energy from the ground, from the summoned elements, from your spirit. From here feel free to go to the next step on whatever intentions you have. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps;)|`|HhCctLofaa	okay...... Just close your eyes imagine your favorite elemental video game scene and put yourself in it.|`|zhL83fSlaa	Er, I really don't think that you or anyone else has magical powers...|`|ey8aWCPUaa	The theory is: as long as you believe, you can do anything.

IOQ0zIFlaa	It takes a lot of patience to find your original sound, but you have to keep trying.  <br>  If it is an option, you could definitely try some private singing lessons because the teacher should warm up your voice and that's an easy way to see how you sound without listening to someone else.<br>  <br>  Also; if you are learning a song, you shouldn't listen to the recording too many times.  Try singing it a Capella.  It'll help with the original-ness.  And take some liberties with the song.  Change some notes if they work or do a couple more riffs or whatever.<br>  <br>  I actually have quite a low voice myself and it took me a long time to realize that it sounded good.  But in the time that I tried having a higher voice, I was hurting my vocal chords because it wasn't natural.  If the shaking of your voice is a problem, it isn't hard to get out of that.  But I would say just sing with your low voice.  Low voices are unique and are really appreciated by educated people in music.<br>  <br>  I have more advice if you need more.  Just ask!  :)

The boy is 13. He is just now starting puberty.

If they do wind up dating, they may or may not realize how different they are in stages of life. If it works out, great! If it doesn't, being friends is always the best solution.

It is preference, and no explanation is necessary.|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	Most kids listen to it because that's just what's popular right now but I don't really get how so many people could fall for it.

Should music taste really have to be justified?|`|MkK8pHgWaa	well I would say b/c rap music has a pretty cool flowing beat and rock is just guitar and stuff...but rap or hip-hop can bring you up...like in a party mood...but the new rock nowadays are just depressing....kind of puts you in a down suicidal mood...but I love rock its my fave especially old rock...but i guess rap is ok sometimes|`|Gxh126vlaa	Rap back then is Okay But with the violence type of rap like with all the"Bling" Now all that sucks Donkey Balls But stuff like Public enemy was pretty cool they had scott ian from Anthrax how Bad-*** is that so I also wonder about that Because I like Rock music and most Rap bands today SUCKS Balls and Im not Kidding|`|J9HEPVdaaa	Its repetitious and therefore hypnotic so they are brainwashed and dried into thinking its okay to listen to by posthypnotic suggestion. And those with no brainpower can substitute the repetitions for brainwaves so they can think about something even if it is something stupid.|`|uNAnDDVTaa	Rap has ryththm and bass so you can dance to it. Rock not so much you can only bang your head. I like both but rap is what I mostly dance to.|`|bOpL5UBNaa	People like rap more than rock because they are following what the crowd follows.  Rap is more recent than rock, so people listen to it.  I still like the good stuff and can't stand rap.|`|GiYVrmI3aa	rap is disgusting. I can't stand it. Dont generalize and assume that everyone likes those retards attempting poetry.|`|q6w8wnX2aa	they like to keep up with today's music|`|212FfV3faa	i dunno.<br>  i dont, anyway|`|tdFq4YMhaa	Because Rap usually talks about living a fancy life style...where i'm from almost everybody listens to Rock more than Rap and Hip Hop. I've been listening to Rap for a couple years now and Rap music just gets stuck in your head easier. But when I listen to Rock... I barely get a word they're saying. Oh and by the way a drum set and guitar isn't the only way to express yourself. Most of the time Rappers are writing about they life and experiences they had. Thats expressing yourself.|`|RBb9ZP7laa	It's popular, and might also have something to do with culture. It's just a difference in taste and there's no reason that they should be looked down on or anything. And it is very possible to express yourself with just your voice!|`|2Qlla9A4aa	Idk its what people like right now
Bdgza4G2aa	I'd probably say that Magikarp is by far the weakest. Feebas does have other attacks, so it would be second to Magikarp. <br>  I think that the point of these weak Pokemon evolving into strong Pokemon are to test the endurance and patience of the trainer, to see if they can sucessfully raise such a difficult Pokemon. If the trainer is successful, they reap the benefits! (I simply used the EXP share and the switching out of battle technique).<br>  My favorite region is Johto. I was captivated especially during Pokemon Crystal. Kanto is my second favorite, Hoenn third, Sinnoh fourth, and Orre last. I also loved all of the Johto Pokemon, especially the three Johto legendaries.|`|Hiasgb75aa	There are weaker Pokemon by stats but what makes Margikarp the weakest is that it has limited moves. Its only move is splash until it gets to level 15 and Flail at 30 which are pretty worthless moves if you look at its attack. Feebas is weak but you can teach Feebas TMs which makes it better than Magikarp.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why they evolve into strong Pokemon, but I guess it makes them worth training since Milotic and Gyarados are good Pokemon<br>  <br>  My favourite region is Hoenn|`|4UeOIGuhaa	I think Magikarp is the weakest, it can only learn Tackle and splash.<br>  <br>  As for Feebas, it can learn more then those two. <br>  <br>  Maybe because they are like a 'joke' kind of pokemon at first lol<br>  <br>  My favorite region is Johto, and the Orange islands maybe ;)

vtx2mujpaa	*****POTENTIAL SPOILERS?*****<br>  <br>  I think they will all die a human death, because I think the ultimate message of the show is what it means 'being human', so that would mean mortality. I reckon Mitchell will die normally, not as a vampire considering he wasn't affected by the star of David, and he hasn't drank blood in a while, Annie will pass over, and maybe George will get rid of his curse, somehow. I was so shocked at episode 5, it was really good!<br>  <br>  But I'm not sure what will happen! If I am right then I promise to use my powers for good :P<br>  <br>  I really enjoy the show though, and the 'men with sticks and rope' has really haunted me :(|`|Bb7TlvnSaa	No idea, but I can't wait!

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	I was also extremely bummed when his A team was split up.  I refused to watch the newer episodes for a long time, and I'm just now catching up on everything I missed.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes it's worth watching, but no, the B team just doesn't have the same spark as the original A team.<br>  <br>  There's still drama, there's still plenty of snark and banter, and there are still tough cases for them to solve.  Plus, Foreman eventually rejoins the main cast.<br>  <br>  And guess what?  Cameron & Chase are still on the show!  They just aren't shown nearly as much.  I think they're being kept on the show because they're gonna eventually return to the team, but this is just a prediction of my own... this isn't a spoiler.|`|8nTu6a4Paa	I was disappointed when he disbanded his team as well, but it's still been really good.  You still see Foreman all the time, you see Cameron here and there, and Chase is the one you see the least or he's in a really quick scene (which I think is a shame).  Definitely watch it, they have some amazing episodes this season and in season 4!|`|f0c95deaaf11cb4f884379031898dea3aa	It is. I'm a long time viewer. I recently went back and saw a season 1 show.

zovrJ0yXaa	i think the shows last season was the best one yet, and season 3 was exceptional as well. season 2 was rubbish but i think since they expanded the mythology of the show theres more chance people will lose interest as there are so many things to resolve. it was simpler when it was just the hatch, the monster and the polar bear. but i prefer the extra stuff to think about, you cant sustain a show on a monster that never appears. i have to admit tho, that this season has been pretty slow and to be honest, quite boring so far. hope it picks up soon|`|EMM6wlm2aa	no. it never did. and it won't have the chance to, either. we know its getting the ax next year.

FjlFi6rxaa	Just do what the music makes you feel!  Jump around, run across the stage, interact with your band mates, sing along even if you do not have a microphone, and/or head bang.  There is a multitude of things you can do, just remember to have fun.  That is essential.  The more fun you are having and the more you move around, the crazier the crowd will go. <br>  <br>  I am not positive on the pedals, but I have not heard anyone I know talk about using them.|`|TBZK5q78aa	Just get into the music bro. Guitar tricks and a lot of headbanging.... Just enjoy yourself and give it all you got. Drink lots of water and warm up your voice, especially if you scream often. Keep your faith in God too... That's most imperative thing.<br>  <br>  Use whatever you think sounds good or look at other bands accessories. See what they use for live shows.

JwGwUcCsaa	Everyone here says that nobody won...That can be wrong.  Naruto was knocked out while Sasuke had the chance to kill him.  But in the end Sasuke decided to leave Naruto because he wanted to find "power his own way" and not just copy his brother.<br>  <br>  But, I believe that it could have been a tie.  The last hits had Sasuke aiming for the stomach (knocking Naruto out) and Naruto scratching the headband of Sasuke.  Naruto probably could have hit Sasuke knocking him out, but wanted to prove a point.  When Sasuke put the headband on, saying they were equal, he also said "you won't lay a scratch on my forehead"  Thats why i think Naruto scratched Sasuke's headband, to show he COULD scratch it and COULD HAVE killed Sasuke if he wasn't wearing it.|`|Q49M8Vcnaa	no one|`|HhCctLofaa	In that episode they're power turned out to be equal when at full power. In the end it turned out to be a tie but both of them were pretty beat up.

7GFNKvDXaa	No. The only part that is kind of gross in when James brakes Bella's leg, but you just hear a slight crack when James' arms move. <br>  <br>  When Edward's family kills James, you see what obviously is a mannicans head being twisted/pulled off, but that's only a shadow in the background. <br>  <br>  So, all in all, god no!  <br>  <br>  Please answer mine - <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222143006AAx3Mx9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|01dfmIjPaa	i'm 11 and i saw it yesterday. <br>  i hate that stuff too, and no, its not all goury<br>  the only thing is when James poisons Bella by biting her, there';s this ring of blood around her wrist. that's it.|`|VmXq5NCOaa	WRONG SECTION!!!|`|6HgiNCmqaa	wow|`|ccmtm3xFaa	heh no you will like it if you understand the images in the book and like the story the movie is good i watch the movie first and then i became hooked now i read the books and wished i read the book first i believe you should be okay its not really goury its more the romantic part than the actions|`|R8nxkVJSaa	the movie is probably worse but it's not very gory at all that i can remember<br>  just read it and if it's too gory (which i dont think it will be) then just stop reading it (but you probably won't be able to bc its amazing)|`|PlEb9YH6aa	no its not really... there is a bit of blood and violence toward the end but nothing traumatizing. i use to like the twilight saga also but the movie ruined it for me >.<|`|g5YlV35zaa	Nope.

8t1JCFMSaa	The CW still has not announced as to whether there will be a season 7 or not.  The reason they take so much time off is because they shoot about 22 episodes, which needs to be spread out during the TV season.  This usually leads to a lot of repeats during the December/January months.  The next new episode is scheduled for March 9.<br>  <br>  It was just announced that One Tree Hill has been renewed for another season.|`|VAu1MfR1aa	It's not just OTH.  This seems to be a common schedule for the CW shows right now.  Unfortunately they're all taking the time off around the same times! :(  Gossip Girl is taking time off as well.  90210 is doing some breaks too.  So I'm thinking it's more of a CW thing rather than OTH.<br>  <br>  Nobody knows for sure if it will be the last season.  There's rumors and it would probably be a good time to end it now after 6 seasons.  We'll have to see I guess how it all pans out!
