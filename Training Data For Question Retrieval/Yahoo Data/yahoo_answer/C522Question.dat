20081109130442AAL4kS8	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Functional cyst vs Complex Cyst?	In late August I had severe abdominal pain on my right side. I ended up going to the emergency room, only to get a male doctor who did all the blood work for an appendix and other severe abdominal issues, but told me to call my "woman" doctor and be seen within 72 hours. I went to my gynecologist who is on a military base, and she said she felt a cyst and thought she had ruptured it. She ordered a blood pregnancy test and an ultrasound. The ultrasound took place two weeks later on a Wednesday. I was told I would get the results back around Monday which I thought was a long time. I was still in pain and contacted my doctor informing her that I thought it was a long time to wait, she agreed and sent me off post to someone that would have quicker appointments for ultrasounds etc. I was called by the off care doctor's nurse with the results of my ultrasound performed on base and told it was a functional cyst and to come back for another ultrasound when my cycle started. I did, but the ultrasoundist at provider off base told me it was a complex cyst. She then reviewed the report from the radiologist on base and told me that he too had said it was complex. I told her I was told it was functional and she said it certainly was not. It is 1.5 cm, the same as noted on base solid mass. She told me the doctor would be calling me to schedule an appointment and discuss surgery. I didn't hear from the doctor so I called and spoke with the same nurse that had given me the first results. She told me AGAIN it was a functional cyst. I told her I was confused and told her two radiologist felt it was complex, and she told me that the doctor felt differently and she's the one who makes the final call. I spoke with my doctor on base who looked up the report and told me once again she agreed it was complex. She won't see me however since she sent me off base. I was able to FINALLY get an appointment with the provider off base who wants to give me birth control to shrink the cyst, even thought with a complex cyst it won't do anything for it. My appointment is this week and I'm very worried on how to approach her and ask her why she is saying it's the opposite than two radiologist have said it was. Also, the second radiologist thought it was a dermoid cyst. Is there anything I should ask them to perform like a CA- 125 blood test? A pap smear? It has now been three months, I'm still in pain and shouldn't have to be stressed on if my doctor is misdiagnosing me! Help!

I tried the best way I could to approach my dad (mother passed away) to tell him that I was worried but he brushed it off and said it would come sooner or later. He really doesn't know a thing about it.  I am sure I should have started by now and I am wondering what may be wrong. I want to make an appointment with a gyno but I am not sure how to approach my dad on this either because I need the money for the copay and he says their is no need for me to go see a doctor because I am not having any pain or discomfort and that "all the books" say that the only reason for a teen to visit a gyno is if they are sexually active....which I am not. How common is it to be 18 and not have had a first period? Will I ever be able to have kids?

I recently took my son to the dentist and found out that he has two decaying teeth that are down to the nerve.  The dentist says they will have to do surgery to remove these two teeth...they claim they can do nothing to save them.  (Is this true?)  He also has two teeth that are going to be filled and two other teeth that are going to have crowns put on.  His surgery is scheduled for the 25th of next month.  Here lately he has been biting his arm really hard.  He doesn't do it because he is mad or anything.  He can be running around playing and just take a bite out of his arm.  The way he does it....it almost seems like a reaction to something.  He is biting so hard that he has marks on his arms.  Do you think his teeth are hurting and he is biting his self to help the pain?

I got a letter in the mail saying I owed my dentist $440. WHOA wtf!? I thought it was covered. I called my insurance and they said it had expired June 5th, 2008. So, I was covered when my dentist asked, but not covered for the 10th. They knew it was the 10th and they still pulled the tooth without telling me it was expired... Is that right?

20090223015701AAtMmEN	Health;Mental Health	I have a mental disorder question...?	i've only been on yahoo answers for a day.  a lot of q's seem to be of the same theme.  i guess i was wondering everyone's opinion on me.  i have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and ocd.  i have a counsellor, doctor and a psychiatrist.  last week however i had my first visit to a psychologist.  she told me that she didn't expect to see me the next week, as she thinks i don't want to change.  she said that i have became comfortable with how things are.  does anyone else think that anxiety etc is all in one's mind and it's up to one's self to change?  if it matters i am on 300 mg of zoloft and 100 mg of seroquel and xanax and valium as required.
20090223011447AAwrX3D	Health;Mental Health	It's been a long time since I've turned to Y!A, but I'm really in deep tonight.?	I suffer from social anxiety, depression, OCD, and insomnia, yeah, being me is great. I'm in the eleventh grade and sort of withdrew myself from life sometime back around the end of October. I way always kinda reserved, quiet, kept to myself. Had friends, but only ever really did anything with them when invited to, always found myself content being alone. Anyway, back in October I disappeared from school, and no one heard from me for several months (besides some of my friends, but I'm sure most everyone thinks I'm dead by this point.       After a billion visits to doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc. I've been put on some medication herbal remedies and have scheduled one-on-one two hour sessions with my teachers for all my major subjects after school. (Just a side note: I'm getting better and am going out with friends more and trying to be more sociable, but that's not the reason I'm here) Three weeks ago I met with my Math, English, History, and Chemistry teachers, great. They all assigned me work to do at home. The following week I was running a few minutes late (it's a mile walk from my house and depending on traffic it can vary several minutes and no matter how I try I always get out of my house around the same time), well I missed her, damn. met with everyone else. The week after that I was sick the day I had her (a single session can help me make up weeks of missed work, and I've been out since late October through to around February, yeah, I'm not in a good place right now. I've also had such issues sleeping I set three alarms and still woke up too late to make my meeting with my history teacher that week. -_- Made the English and Chem ones, but 2/4 is terrible. They've taken time out of their lives to keep me from failing miserably and this is how I repay them. : /      Well tomorrow I have math again and I haven't done a single thing she's assigned me (and oh boy, there's A LOT of it [she assigned a ridiculous amount nightly while I was in school, so I saw this coming]). I'm a terrible procrastinator to boot and now it's 4:00am, if I get an eight hour night's rest it'll be noon and I'll have two hours before I have to meet her. I can't even remember half of the stuff she's assigned because we went over weeks worth of math in a two hour cram session. She's a lovely person and she told me about how a close friend has been dealing with a similar situation and how her son suffers from another social disorder, so she says she understands. I recall she also mentioned that my well being comes before the schoolwork, but I haven't seen her in weeks and I can't live with myself going in with nothing to show her after all this time.       So here I am, typing out a body of text that more than likely won't be read by anyone instead of trying to start the ocean of work she's outlined for me to do. When I look at the walls of numbers and letters I have a feeling I might be dyslexic (hell, at this point I might as well be a hypochondriac), but I excel in English and chemistry and I'm pretty good at math in short spurts, so that can't be it. I know I'm seeking advice in the middle of the night from people who are either too tired to even read this far into this, or are waking up and probably have better things to do than respond, but if there's anyone out there with some advice, please, im not in a good way.       please no "tl: dr"s. Yes, it's long I know.

20090222204740AAnHDy6	Health;Mental Health	When will I feel better after my mom's death?	My mother passed away suddenly two weeks ago. I know that grieving will take time, but I feel absolutely horrible. I feel panicky. I am not sleeping or eating. I cry at the drop of a hat and over crazy things. I feel so nervous. Everyone is trying to get me to take something for my nerves but I am breastfeeding my 8 week old. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this type of grief and pain. If so, when does it feel better? I need to know that there is hope. Also, if anyone knows of anxiety medication that can be taken while nursing. I am sure there must be something out there since there is treatment for postpartum issues. I know the suggestions about calling my doctor but I would like to know if anyone has real life knowledge from experience or knowing someone.

20090223005230AAR4kSp	Health;Men's Health	In need of love advice..?	Guy #1-Asks about me through other people, for example,through my immediate co-worker George, and,through another manager-he asks"So how are you guys doing over there",he says that everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else for that matter.He's also called up to my job three times,blocking out his number, asking for my whereabouts and told my co-worker that he wanted to meet me, but he never showed.so i called him to chat, we talked for over two hours, and he Told me I can definetly call him anytime. And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

So I'm 19 and I've had this strange thing for about 5 years... It's a strange rash that I get from my neck to my chest to my shoulders. It's so weird!!! It only happens when I'm under stress, or under a lot of heat. it's a pinkish-redish rash that goes away after about 10 minutes. When I'm with my girlfriend, during and after we have sex, I get this rash, and it's just annoying. It doesn't really feel like anything, it's just red. Like my whole body blushes. Now, sometimes, like when I'm in a jacuzzi with a bunch of people, I am sometimes under a bit of stress and heat, so it starts to feel like little pinching sensations. They get so bad that I have to leave the jacuzzi and maybe take a quick cold shower. It's insane!!! I've told my doctor, but he's a f*cktard and doesn't know of course. He can't even come up with a proper name for it. He says I might grow out of it, but it's been close to 6 years having to suffer with this **** every day. I tried a second doctor, and he doesn't even know as well. Wtf? Does anyone know what this could be? Anyone have something like this? It bugs me more than my acne does, cause I know that'll go away eventually, but this I'm not to sure.   Funny thing is, I want to become a cook, an executive chef when I grow up because I love making food. But when I'm under a bit of pressure, and a bit of heat (where a cook would work) I just go nuts because of this pain.... Please help...=(

He is gay and I'm a hetero girl.  I thought we would get along fine, but he tricked me.  He lied to me about a lot of things like that he likes to be neat and clean.  HE IS REALLY A PIG.  Grosest thing of all is the toilet.  He constantly has diarrhea.  It splashes all over the seat, and once he didn't make it to the toilet in time and got poop on the rug and LEFT IT THERE!  He told me he thought I wouldn't notice on a beige rug!  I come from a really clean household and I feel like I am paying $850/ month to be his cleaning lady.  He also comes in the house with shoes on when I am the ONLY ONE that vacuums and mops like twice a week.  I asked him to keep boots out the house in winter because there is salt and dirt and just gross, but he doesn't care, its like talking to a wall.  He sleeps with a fan and all the blinds shut and talks in his sleep and we share the bedroom and I haven't gotten a night of sleep since I moved in.  To make matters worse he just found out he is HIV+ and I don't want to be the one constantly cleaning the toilet after him.  I know I can't get anything that way, but its still gross.  Like you have a disease and you should be careful and clean around others.  I don't think its acceptable.  He has admitted that he has not scrubbed the toilet ONCE since i moved in (and it was nasty when i got here...its finallly white) just the other night i heard him going at like 3 am when he got home.  I scrubbed and wiped the fecies splatters this morning.  Came back from the library few hours later and same thing again all over the toilet seat.  I cannot live like this i told him today to clean up after himself and he told me i am crazy.  I am ready to break lease.  Is this a liable reason to get out of it?  I have addressed him mutiple times about cleanlyness and he doesn't seem to get it.  Doesn't lift a finger.  I'm his live in (and paying him) cleaning lady.  What do i do?

20081015091405AAOK1D7	Health;Dental	What is this pain all about?	I had this weird pain on my teeth 2 weeks ago. It didn't hurt like a cavity or gum inflammation. It hurt more like a sore pain,kind of dull and numb.I couldn't identify if i was hurting on just 1 or multiple teeth.It felt sometimes like the whole left side of my mouth was in pain.   I bought some orajel and applied it in the area. The pain went away.   Then it came back stronger a couple of days ago. Orajel helped but wouldn't go away just with it. I also took some ibuprofen, which made it go away. But then it would come back every so many hours.   I went to the dentist this morning, hoping for an answer. He took X-rays and said the only think he could see was that i needed a filling on my wisdom tooth and a cleaning.   My cleaning is scheduled for next week.I don't think the cleaning would do anything.   But after the filling, now it hurts 10 times worse. I never ever had any type of pain or discomfort after a filling. I just took 2 tylenol 30 min ago and didn't even diminish the pain.   What can I do?

20081231100325AAirLiR	Health;Dental	Has anyone ever experience this (dental problem)?	Last Friday, my husband had 3 teeth extracted, as he had been in agony for about 2 weeks with cavities and broken teeth. When the dentist pulled the top tooth, he noticed that the nerve or part of the tooth (I'm not sure which) was going into the sinus cavity. The dentist stopped what he was doing after removing the tooth, and digging in there for a little bit, and said he was going to leave the remainder of the tooth/nerve because he didn't want to damage the sinuses since it had been up in there. That night, my husband reported that he was getting gushes of air going from his sinuses through the hole in his gums into his mouth. He describes it as the sound you hear when you squeeze a plastic lemon when it's at the end, so only air comes out. The next day, that sound had stopped, but on Sunday, he started with a wicked sinus headache. He's been in agony ever since. It's getting to where his sinuses are impacted, he has throbbing pain in his jaw, sinus cavities around his nose, eyes, and forehead, and when he bends over, his nose drips. Also, he is spitting out a brown/green color coming from his nose into his mouth (sorry to be so gross). Yesterday, we called the dentist and they got him in right away. The dentist said it's normal "communication" between the sinuses and mouth, because the sinuses have to get used to not having that in there. He also said that he tore part of the sinuses when he was trying to get the rest of the tooth/nerve. My husband is on a powerful antibiotic (Clindamycin), and was on Pennicilin VK for 10 days before that. So, we're also concerned about how serious this could be if a sinus infection came on AFTER being on these antibiotics. The dentist said that, even though this condition is rare (tooth/nerve into the sinus cavity), that the reaction he's having is normal, and that the antibiotic should clear it out. Of course, my husband is going to take all of the antibiotics to finish it, but I'm wondering if any one else has experienced or heard of this, and if we should be concerned, and see his PCP about this also. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Serious answers only, please!

20090223001408AAFte5o	Health;Mental Health	Is this abuse? So confused...?	I have been with my now ex boyfriend for 4 years. After college, he convinced me to move away with him to start a new life. The first year we lived together was amazing but then it slowly started to fall apart. He would call me stupid, crazy and fat. He would seem to get angry when I would talk to my mother because I would tell her how he was treating me. He would also follow me into my bank and look over my shoulder when I would make cash with drawls. He explained to me that he loved me and did not want me to get robbed. He also controlled who my friends were but he justified it by saying my friends were not good people. I finally got the courage to move back home and now he won't leave me alone. He has flowers delivered to me and tries to keep tabs on me by emailing my friends and family and telling them how much he misses me and loves me. He tells me all the time how he changed and he wants to move where I am so we can be together. He tells me that our love is pure and all the other guys I talk to now just want to get in my pants. I have been very stern about our break up and I told him I simply want a platonic relationship but all he does is cry and say how dead he feels inside. This is tearing me up. Is this real love?

Im trying to see if it's maybe linked to low blood sugar, because it sometimes happens when ive not eaten in a couple of hours, when it happened today i was actually going to get something to eat after sleeping for a couple of hours in the afternoon.       ps: im not not anorexic or underweight, i eat a fair bit mainly due to me going through growth spurts, and when i say ive not eaten in a while, i mean ive not had something to eat recently (ie. in the past hour or two). so most of my "dizziness" occurs before dinner.

20090223003622AAgvYJx	Health;Men's Health	Aldactone (12.5mg) and Premarin (0.075mg) for males?	I am a drag queen who has been performing for over 10 years now approx 5 nights a week. I recently went to the doctor to ask him about getting some form of low dosage female hormone therapy to soften my features and feminize my looks. The doctor prescribed me to take half a tablet of 25mg Aldactone (12.5mg) and 1/4 of a tablet of 0.3mg Premarin (0.075) both daily. I am just wondering whether people think that this will be enough to feminize my looks and enable my breast tissue to slightly increase so I am able to give the illusion of cleavage with silicone inserts. Your opinion would be greatly appreciated ! Thanks.
20090223003442AAXWNom	Health;Diet & Fitness	Does being fat increase hair loss ?	I'm only 17 and I'm having a really high amount of hair loss a day. This hair loss has also caused for my scalp to be more visible, i hope this does not mean I'll go bald. I'm pretty much sure that this isn't due to heredity because my father is still not bald. I used to straighten my hair but it's been almost a year since i stopped it. My mom tells me to drink more and more water and reduce weight because I'm also a bit fat. I'm afraid that i might not get my lost hair back or whether they will grow again. So do you think drinking more water and reducing weight will help ? or should i consult a Dermatologist ?

20090223010454AA0j8bX	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Am I overreacting by fearing a heart attack?	I just turned 30, run 25 miles a week, can run a mile in less than 5 minutes, lift weights once a week, eat fairly healthy, not overweight at all.  But one of my great-grandfathers died of a heart attack at 45; I don't think anybody else in my family has (mostly it's been drinking and smoking, etc. that gave them cancer or something else bad.)  Both my parents have high cholesteral and take meds; they're late 50's.  Once in a while my heart beats funny if I'm really tired or drink caffeine.  And I"ve fainted in the past if I stand in one place too long.   So anyways, I did a hard run the other day and then started fearing a heart attack while running and dying in front of people.  So I read about Alberto Salazar, 50 yrs old, former marathon record holder, and how he had a heart attack, but lives like I do.   I'm totally obsessed with heart attacks now.   I'm afraid to run even though it's the only thing that makes me feel truly alive and healthy.  I like to run fast, but what if I die doing it or something?   Am I just a hypochondriac?  I mean I know you don't have to be fat or a smoker to have a heart attack, so do you think I'm okay to run hard?

Because if I fail like my sister did, I get in trouble. My mum woke up and got really annoyed at me. They threatened to take the internet off me for a month (I own the laptop) However, when my sister is on the computer at two/three am. They say nothing, do nothing. My sister's bedroom was worse than mine. They CLEANED IT FOR HER, yet if my room isn't spotless by the morning I loose the internet for a month. I don't have my assignment finished. I get in trouble. My sister never done her assignments and my mother never done anything. If I  do anything my sister has done that she shouldn't off, I get in ten times as much trouble, when she didn't even get a slap on the wrist. Why are parents so hypocritical         Also. I have previously had problems with my eating. However I have been fixing these and been doing really really good lately. Since this I have started starving myself again, I feel really depressed and I just want to die.

20090223021954AAnJROL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Worried about AIDS help!?	Almost 2 months ago had unprotected sex with an Australian girl for about 30-seconds to a minute in a pool before i realised i was unsafe and stopped. Since then I've gone to check for the most common std's and results came back that i didnt. Doctor said the likely hood of aids/herpes is very low. But i worry a lot. Anyway, I know that early symptoms are a flu like illness 2-6 weeks after infection. After 7 weeks (last week) I've had a runny nose, sore throat. So now im worried this is because I have AIDS. I checked for swolen lymph nodes around my groin, theres a small bump in one spot but i think thats a vein. A few other people i know have had a cold lately too. BUT im still worried. I'm going to get tested after 12 weeks. Am i just paranoid, or is it likely i have it?

20090223022646AAg3Ywx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Pain after UTI Kidney infection treated?	Since last year I have been getting the odd intermittent kidney ache (dull throb) but it is not painful just a twinge. I didnt go to the doc at first as it only usually happened after alcohol at first and quite a few people I know said they got it sometimes too. However a month ago during a routine medical at work the doctor tested my urine and said I had a kidney infection. My urine got tested at the lab and it was said I had a nasty UTI. Anyway after 3 weeks of different antibiotics my doc tested my urine again and only small traces of bacteria was found which suggested it was probably cleared. However, I am still every day (some worse than others) getting this throb in my left kidney every now and again and twinges. I had an xray and stones were ruled out and today I have an ultrasound but im dreading cancer. I am 25, not lost any weight and feel generally healthy. What else could this be and has anyone else had pain after the infection?
20090223023410AAfubaG	Health;Dental	Is General anaesthetic safe for children?	Hi,   My seven year old is due to have a tooth removed under general anaesthetic but I am worried.  Is it really safe?     He previously had one tooth removed by numbing the area with injection.  But after the removal he fainted and he now has a fear of the dentist and is very nervous about any work being done.     The dentist suggested general anaesthetic and I thought that was the best option but then people have told me it can be dangerous.     Can someone reassure me as my dentist never went into any detail about the dangers.  She said all would be fine as it is quite a common procedure without any problems, but that was all she said.    My child will not be willing to have the tooth removed by numbing the area because of the previous reaction but there is no alternative.
