20090202165950AAt63Tt	Social Science;Psychology	How do I overcome my lack of confidence when making decisions?	I am usually quite confident - I am quiet but I get along with people well and I am not timid, but I get scared if I need to make decisions - not tiny decisions, but things like when I am writing a reasonably important email I have to ask about 5 people to read it for me before I send it even if I know deep down that it is ok.   I always have to ask peoples opinions. I think I had a knock to my confidence about 2/3 years ago and I havent got over it, Its very frustrating and I don't know how to stop!

20090202170028AAaWCDn	Social Science;Psychology	Lucid dreaming in specific positions?	Lately when I feel a little tired I'll take a quick nap, hour, maybe two hours. Usually I don't climb all the way into my bed but kind of leave my ankles hanging over because I'm not going to sleep completely for the time being.      The thing is I don't dream anywhere near as descriptively and or vividly when I'm having my daily night time rest. Thus far I've attested my ability to lucid dream to my feet hanging over the bed. Strange as it sounds I think that because my legs aren't completely supported that my mind is aware of this, so my mind may be asleep but not my body. I'm having trouble giving a legitimate reason, but I wanted to see if that makes any sense at all, because I'm at a loss.

20090202171345AAAL0wb	Social Science;Psychology	My Mom is not sticking to what she says, it's like all she wants to do is fight.  what do I do?	My Mom has told me for a very long time that she would get me a car. My birthday came around and she and I spent days looking at used cars and test driving. She gives me price range that I can get a car at, and tells me she will not help me whatsoever with finding a car. So I do my research, and I have spent over a month doing that, getting a feel for what cars would be affordable and practical. Every car I have showed her within her price range, she finds some reason to trash it. So she lowered her price range a huge amount, and I found many cars in that decreased price for a very good deal. Again, she trashed every one. I asked her why, and she says because I'm finding too decent of cars for that price. So I ask her what kind of cars she would prefer, and to find cars that she would be willing to buy me. She told me she WOULD NOT help me at all and that it's not her place at all to help me. She wants me to call her insurance place and find out insurance on every car, and I just turned 16, I can't do EVERYTHING like that.     Now she is telling me that she will not get me a car. I asked why, and she said because of the economy. When just a few weeks ago she was all for it. I feel like she keeps coming up with excuses on why she will not let me get a car. I told her I would get a job, and pay for gas and everything. She will not talk to me when I tell her how I feel. She just interrupts and puts me down by saying personal things to make me feel bad about who I am as a person. My friend even noticed how rude my Mom is to me, and that she always puts me down when I am being respectful.  My mom suffers from depression, and I'm wondering if she is bi polar at all. She is a single mom, really no friends of boyfriend, just really close sisters.     I even let it go for a while, hoping she would cool off.     I feel like I am doing EVERYTHING to be responsible and doing what she asks, I'm stuck and just don't feel like my Mom is in the right?    Please any advice??
20090202172711AAMwdc5	Social Science;Psychology	My Mom always puts me down, and criticizes me. What do I do?	My Mom suffers from depression, but is on medication. She has always put me down and said very hurtful things to me to make me feel horrible as a person. Many think it is a lot of jealousy, because when I am with her, people always comment on how pretty I am and dont say anything about her. She even told me that it's not fair that I get compliments and she doesn't.  I just turned 16, and it's only gotten worse. I know my mom and I are complete opposites, not only in how we look, but personality and our tastes. When I am being respectful to her, she is still very rude to me. She makes so many comments that are very personal that definitely hurt me. I try to talk to her about it, and she just will have nothing to do with it. She just yells at me, and comes up with excuses on why everything is ALWAYS my fault. I will admit, I'm not the PERFECT teen, but who is? Many of my friends who have been around her have noticed how rude she is to me, and how she just puts me down. My dad knows all about it, he had to live with it until they divorced. My dad talks to me about it, telling me to try not to take it personal because its just her depression talking. All she does when I'm around is want to be rude and fight with me, and that makes me very upset and it makes me be rude also because of what she says to me.       It is so hard because many have asked, "Is your Mom always like that?" and saying that their moms are only that harsh once in an occasion.       It hurts so much to have a Mom that is so full of jealousy, and resentment. I can't talk to her about it because she just bashes me and NEVER admits she is wrong or says she is sorry. This has been going on ever since I was very young. She has ranged from comments about me being "ugly" to "fat" to "disgusting" and "stupid"       I am in shape, and am skinny in a healthy way, and doing decent in school. It's just so hard for me.       Any advice??

There's this girl in my class who is a right missy, a bit snobby and a bit stuck up and I wouldn't ever trust her with a secret.   She's quite pretty apparantly according to boys (and she even says so herself) though, really skinny and all the boys seem to worship her even though she's such a cow!   Please help me understand- the boys always flirt with her as she reciprocates and they like keep picking her up and teasing her and she giggles and stuff but sometimes she will be in a huge mood over nothing and ALL the boys want to know whats wrong and even if she's really horrible to them they don't care and they are concerned about her. Everything she says captures their attention and they find everything that she says really funny, she has hoards of boys around her all the time, but how come?   You can't talk to her and shes horrible so why?   Do boys prefer someone they can trust and is nice than someone like her?   Huh??? :P      Thanks :)

I got accepted to a really good school for Anthropology and Archeology a few months back (Mercyhurst College), and after some soul searching I decided this is what I would like to study. I got accepted for a B.A. in Anthropology, but I'm going to try and change that to a B.S. in Bioarcheology (the school has a M.S. in Forensic Anthropology that I could try for after my B.S.). Anyways, I'm scared to death that I wont be able to find a job in this career field, but furthermore, any job at all. I can accept that I might not be able to get a job in this sort of thing without moving really far away, but I at least want a job that isnt like sitting at a desk and reading paperwork all day. Any suggestions? Any at all? I'm sort of at a loss for words right now, but I'm just curious if I'm heading the right direction here. Thank you.
20090202175455AAHTpJj	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are men emotionally insecure about casual relationships with women?	Why do men start acting different around a woman after getting to know her. What I mean is men, and even older supposedly more emotionally mature men, will go out of their way to be friendly or flirt with a woman when they know each other as casual acquaintances- such as a coworker or neighbor. Then if it seems like if they really hit it off and have a fun or good connection- the next time the man sees the woman he will act weird or pretend like they never even talked to you. If a woman starts a friendship with another woman, they both will usually continue the conversations and make plans to go to lunch or something. Are men so afraid of commitment, that they get scared of having even casual, fun and flirty friendships with the opposite sex. Or is it that they actually have a difficult time keeping it fun and friendly and take it more seriously than the woman meant it to be? Any ideas or experiences with this?
20090202175701AAOPnUx	Social Science;Psychology	Change in life. Just wondering, I'm different.?	I'm 16 and very mature. Adults you probably don't believe me but it's ok. The thing is I used to hang with friends alot. Have fun goof off go to the etc. But in the last year maybe, I've been with drawing from everything. Friends that are bad influences, bad decisions. Everything sort of turned grey. All I do anymore is read books in my free time, not talk in class and finish my work with A's. I've never been an A student, but life seems like it's all of a sudden changed. What I liked, what I did. I'm not saying that it's bad, but I don't even like being around people my age because I believe they are immature and don't think deeply the way I do. Am I ok? Is this depression, or just change, good and bad in a way.

20090202185411AApJ2i7	Social Science;Psychology	Uncontrollable rage. is this a condition? should i seek help? ?	hello all im looking for the opinion of someone(preferably a psyc major or like major) who can help me before i go to seek help,if needed.      I have since puberty experienced uncontrollable rage when certain buttons are pushed. there are few factors that can get me to that stage but when they are initiated it gets scary. When put into a rage I become violent and incoherent and I am hardly able to control my actions. As a teenager I would simply "blackout" when put into a rage and by the time i was finished raging I would no know why or exactly what I had done.      However as I have reached my early 20's it now seems that I am in a jeckle and hyde(spelling?)phase. To be more clear, as I am fighting with the person i am arguing with I am also having an internal fight with myself. for example my emotions set me up to be so violent that i think i may seriously hurt someone but my mind is arguing telling me not to do it. last night for example while fighting I nearly grabbed something heavy to throw at my spouses head(something that could have caused A LOT of damage) as i reached for it it was like my conscious fought my body, my hand was caught in the air while i had an inner struggle. this inner struggle, as i call it, gets so bad and confusing(since its like my primal self is fighting my normal self) that i completely break down crying and usually lose all control of normal functions. it literally feels like at that moment i have lost my mind as i am no longer able to form coherent thoughts. its like after that inner battle my mind breaks.         at that point i have to medicate myself with something that will calm me before the anger comes back again(usually sleeping pills)      I know i need help but is there any condition out there that sounds similar? I dont want to be like that i dont want to hurt anyone when im at that point but it seems like i really have no control.      I have not had any previous mental health problems however my mother was diagnosed manic depressive when i was 15. I have looked up bipolarism but i feel that my rage periods dont come frequently enough as they only come once every few months.

20090202172434AARN1ij	Social Science;Sociology	How can I stop myself from trying to buy an image, "fit in," and be a copy of someone who is liked/popular etc?	I am going on and I have come to this realization with my therapist. Ever since I was ilke I have been trying to kind of buy my way into happiness. In school I always would blow tons of money on stuff not because I truly wanted it but because the cool kids had it and I wanted to be like them (from hairstyle to abercrombie clothes to doc martens, etc.) then whenever I got past that in college I wanted to be like this person or that person so I would not only try to emulate them but to almost clone them within myself. For example,. I might try and act just like that person and look like that person and everything like that. I jsut have kept doing it, hoping one would work. If it wasn't the perfect preppy it was the rebel if it wasn't that then it was ____ if it wasn't that then it was ______. I have finally realized it. The question I have and need advice for is how do I stop? Everyone I ever talk to says just be yourself. The thing is I don't know who the hell I realyl am in a context of my likes and dislikes as a person. I have been so desperate for acceptance that I would do anything (except to the level of drugs, etc) to be a part of the in crowd of society and to feel loved and aceepted. How do I really become my own self?

I always get out safely, and i usually grab my guitar as im running out the door. Recently my family moved and my brother, a close friend of mine and i all had a dream that my the house i lived in burned down the same night.. I moved into my new house just before xmas, and ive already dreamt of it burning down once. it was the same as all the other ones, just in a different setting. house fires aren't something im consciously  afraid of so it has to be a different meaning. thanks for your suggestions:)

Outside the cave entrance there is a pile of mammal bones (deer, bison, pig), fish bones and stone fragments. In the main cavern there is a hearth with three feet of ash depth. Found in the hearth among the ashes are charred deer bones, fish bones, plum pits, broken pieces of several clay figurines that depict human females and charcoal. Strewn around the cavern and in several layers below the current level are a variety of stone tools such as hand axes, scrapers, projectile points and some wooden pieces to which some of the projectile points were attached, fish hooks and eyed needles made from ivory. You also find the intact burial of a child accompanied by a dog in the back recess of the main cavern. There are tools, food and a polished mammoth tooth in the burial and pollen from daisies covering the child's body.       In a small cavern accessed through a 50 foot long tunnel, you find paintings of deer and bison-like animals on the walls and ceiling; there are also human "stick" figures and hand prints and spirals on the walls; there is a stone "lamp" with animal fat residue in the bowl of the lamp, but no other stone tools.       1.

I honestly am indifferent and know that college life and independent is for me. Well to the real situation, my mother told me that she was pregnant and i really did not care. i honestly felt bad for her simply for the fact that she is young and could do something productive with her life instead of sitting around having kids like the rest of the family does. am i bad for really not being happy for her or for any young woman who chooses to settle down and start a family at like the age of 18? be honest,  i think the worst i am being is judgmental and being a little more realistic, but you tell me.

I avoided him because that's what we always do. I sat down and one guy who is friends with him started talking to me and asked why me and my ex never talked anymore and said i didnt have to answer if it was a long story. Then he was like wait you broke up with him huh? In my dream I was like yeah thats it because I didn't want to go into detail. Then my ex came over and said no she's lying. The reason I don't like talking to her is because she kept saying we could go out again and again after we broke up and then never did and that he was really mad at me for it. I got embarrassed and hide in his shirt and he kinda hugged me. Then his girlfriend came over and I told him he should go because he was making her mad by talking to me.       So... any ideas on what all of this means?

I'm 25 and have 2 great jobs which I love (65hours per week -don't tell me to cut down please, I cannot). I didn't study further than secondary (high) school. I am fairly clever and would like to persue further education later but at the moment am enjoying work (and the money) too much.    I have recently had a failed attempt at a relationship and looking at myself through her eyes, realised that I'm fairly dull. At 21 I was the life and soul of every party, a player and a dealer to boot. Since then i have grown up a bit, abandoned womanising, drugs and most of my old friends. Now I have a very small social circle and few interests.    I'll cut to the chase. I would love some suggestions based on your experiences of something you have done at similar junctures in life which kickstarted another phase of your life.   Like, taking up Tai Chi   Learning to play guitar   Joining a sporting club   Returning to church (I have done this and have found it enormously fulfilling by the way)      Also open to more eccentric suggestions -and more likely to follow!   Like, buy decks and learn to scratch,   Learn all the lyrics to every Wu-Tang Clan song   Go paragliding.       Yeah, in fairness I am fairly happy, but I just feel a little empty and unfulfilled. Perhaps it is just love I need, or do I need to get my head straight before I can find true love?      Remember I am tied to these jobs for a few more years at least.    Thanks in advance folks, any advice will be considered.      (I'm not going to go paragliding, I'm Irish, It's always raining here:D )

20090202173836AAWE56i	Social Science;Psychology	How do I get past being surrounded by coworkers who despise and resent me?	I was hired for a role that was was never intended for me, and my supervisor kept me there to toy with me and make me look like a fool in front of many people there; she even got the others in the office to pick on me. While I knew I didn't have all the credentials, I did have enough qualifications for the job as I knew it (one of the other problems was that I wasn't given clear direction nor clarification of my role).      When my supervisor told me to do other work when a new manager came in, I was confused, and innocently I sought clarification with the new boss.      Then, he seized on the one-upping and crushed my supervisor (eventually), and the retaliation began. In its aftermath, all the people there resent me and say sarcastic things in a snide, incidental way to me. It bothers me that they think this of me when all I wanted was direction and clarification of my role -- whatever that role was.      My coworkers are too savvy to think I was naive in my thinking I could carry out my role, but I was, although there was a part of me that wanted her to pay for her actions.      One bad thing that happened was the guy I really liked is my supervisor's friend, so he doesn't at all care for me (even though he did at one point). I can kick myself over this, really. How can I cope nonetheless, besides looking for a new job??

All you need to know: I'm an ugly, socially awkward 16-year-old boy, with no close friends, high book-smarts but woefully low street-smarts, who at this point is wasting his life on such internet activities as Answers, in addition to Guitar Hero, and such. I feel changing myself to be more sociable is impossible, because of my reputation as a recluse, and the awkwardness which would accompany such a radical change.      How do I get a life?      (please don't just say, "Get outside." I've been locked away inside for so long, I literally don't have a clue how that would work.)
20090202174855AAGqWCb	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I not social like everybody else?	I know I sound like a nerd (at least I don't look or dress like one), but I'm just lost. The doctor told me I have Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, I suspect I may also have Social Anxiety Disorder as well. I have problems being social with people I don't know. I'm in High School by the way (Freshman Grade 9). I don't understand why whenever I'm with alot of people, especially in school, instead of trying to be social and positive, I become closed up and hateful/negative. I usually blame myself and others for my failure at social life. I only have a couple (like 5-7) "school/class buddies" I talk to. The one thing that keeps me going is the fact that "popular" kids and girls are willing to talk to me, I know they don't know how much of a loner I am, or else they wouldn't talk to me. I don't know how to catch an opportunity because whenever someone talks to me, I never know how to keep a conversation going (my usual responses are always just "Pss wow" or "yeah"). I also usually manifest my hatred in the forms of racism (I'm a White Mexican that lives in the U.S.), I keep all my hateful feelings inside me, I never release them, I just use racism as a tool to express my hate inside of me. I'm not a real racist though. I hate myself for being sometimes racist and a loser at life. I always am stressed out and I always have anxiety - for example, the minute I get to class, I count down every minute till its end unlike being social instead. I don't know how to keep a friendly relationship. I know people talk to me and say 'hi' sometimes, but I close up and never say 'hi' to them (although when they say hi, I respond back). People have to talk to me or will not talk at all. I've tried to be social, but being halfway through the schoolyear, it's too late to try to make friends out of the people who know I don't talk. Also, I always get discouraged from being social when I see other people socializing and I'm always "out of the group" - for example, in my P.E. class, everyone knows everyone and they always talk and form a big circle amongst themselves, and I'm always alone and away from everyone else (except for my friend who's in that class thank God! but he's just like me, he's out of the group). The only thing that keeps me going is the beliefs and lies I tell to myself that "tomorrow will be a new beginning". I always talk to myself, because when I get home from school, I stay home and only go out when my parents force me to, I have no friends to talk to, I always keep my good/positive and bad/negative feelings stored inside. I can't understand this - I feel like dying because no one is there for me to socialize with and I also hate having friends because then you have to go to their houses and others "favors"...I have two sides to me that neutralize any hope of getting a life. But actually, my social side has been more dominant recently, and I feel so so depressed that I have no one to talk to. While everyone else in class smiles and jokes around, I keep a cold dry serious expression, sometimes I have an expression on my face that says "**** you". Whenever I'm in class or around lots of people, I get a strange feeling inside me, a hateful one. I don't have a brother or a sister, so I never grew up knowing how to be social. I hate family and family reunions and relatives. All my other family is in Mexico, but I don't want to go there because I was born in the U.S., and I like the city I live in. And I don't know why, but when someone smiles at me, it goes a long way and it makes me feel good inside. When people talk to me (positively obviously), I feel realized. I like to ride in a car with a family member around my city before sunset and after because it also makes me feel good and "realized". I'm asking anyone out there to give me suggestions, I'm growing more hostile and hateful every day and I cannot bare it. If you've read the whole description above, I know I have big problems with myself, but I'm a nice guy, don't judge me by my ways I've told you about, nobody's perfect. If you answer this, please don't just tell me to not be racist and hateful, like I said nobody's perfect. I just want some advice on how to better my social life and how to actually get a life. I'm so so desperate. Thank you.

I know it seems stupid to be upset over a lizard, but I loved him so much he could have been a horse. His cage is in my room, and he is still in his cage, resting on his plastic palm tree he would sleep on. It was a horrible way to die for him, and the most painful for me. He wasn't able to open his eyes because he was dehydrated (which was really hard to tell). At first I thought he was dead b/c he wasn't moving or breathing. He started to move, so I ran and got water and a Q-tip and water, and brushed the water onto the sides of his mouth. My mom ran and got a small dropper and opened his mouth and dropped a drop in. It wasn't working, and my mom went to church. I tried the dropper again, but I think I opened his mouth

20090202191159AAP9JlC	Social Science;Psychology	What can be done about this?	What is this called? Can anyone relate to this?   hope this doesn't sound too crazy, but I wonder if anyone can relate to this. This sounds weird, but I can't help it.      We all know that some people are transsexual or transgendered. These people are trapped in the body of the wrong gender (or they believe that they are). In other words, someone who is physically a man but feels like they were meant to be a woman... would be considered transgendered. They sometimes go on to have gender reassignment surgery, and go on to have relatively (compared to the past) normal lives. I don't understand it, but I wouldn't judge them either (I have no idea what it's like).      Is it unreasonable to suppose that some people are born with the wrong last name?    Some people simply don't like their last names, but that's not what I'm referring to.    I don't know very many people like me, who have a legal last name that they can't identify with. I felt like I was meant to be named something else. I hate the name Williams, but I don't even think of it as "my" last name. I feel like I got stuck with someone else's name. As a kid in school when I had to sign that name I felt like I was being forced to wear someone else's ugly old shabby sweater.      People say, "you just hate your name." That's like saying that a transsexual hates their gender. I dislike being female a lot, for many reasons, but I know I'm a woman. If I were transsexual, I would be a man trapped in a woman's body.       It's more than I hate the last name Williams. I feel like I'm not a "Williams." I feel like I was supposed to be something else.       Ever since I can remember I've loved latin culture and longed to be a part of that world. I felt out of place in anglo culture... I'm not putting it down. I just didn't belong.    When I found out I had Spanish ancestors I was happy at first but now I feel foolish telling people. Your last name represents your heritage. There's nothing Spanish about Williams, so when I tell people that's my name they think I don't have Spanish blood. It's really annoying because I loved latin culture so much but... I have a name that labels me an outsider.      Is there a name for this? What is this phenomenon called?    People who are trapped in the body of the opposite sex are called transsexual or transgendered... but I've never heard of many people like me, who got the wrong name.       I imagine that a lot of people will think I'm weird, but I wouldn't judge someone as "abnormal" for being transgendered. I have told very few friends about my problem because I imagine people wouldn't understand why I feel the way I feel.      I don't mean to offend anyone but I just feel like my true name should have been something else. I get so sick of having a plain-sounding name, and I hate how my full name sounds together. Generic, like someone pulled it out of a hat. It makes me feel like a nobody. I'm tired of being just another generic girl... I want to feel unique, like an individual. It bothers me a lot.'      I'm 29... I don't want to take my husband's last name if I ever get married.  I want a name of my own.

Okay so i've had this dream 3 times   Im in lake tahoe with my best friend, my crush (also a friend) and another friend, were all being chased by a killer. So we go hide inside of a tent, and we see a video of him. He had taped it himself. So in the video he says Im on the back road and im coming to get you. (The back road is next to where we put our tent), and so my crush, and my two friends and I run out of the tent and are going to hide in the back road. So im running behind all of them, when the killer comes out from behind the tent and grabs my crush and slits his throat. My friends and I all scream but we also run away. I go hide in a huge tent, next to a table. on that table is a glass full of jello. So the killer comes into the tent. Im hiding behind a small table and im in a puffy parka. So im so scared that im shaking, and so the jello on the table is shaking too. I accudentally knock over the table and so then i scream and run out of the tent. The killer starts to chase me then I trip and fall, but i get up again and keep running. My best friend comes to save me, but she dies, and then my other  friend comes to save me too, but he dies. Im all alone and so then I go and jump in the lake to hide. The killer throws a stone at me, and it hits me in the back. Im in the middle of the lake, I start to sink, and i can't stop. I sink all the way to the bottom of the lake, where there are a whole bunch of bodies. I can still breath and stuff, but I can't move. Then the killer comes down with a huge knife, and he's about to kill me, but then I wake up...      What does this dream mean?

20090202185112AArdYTZ	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I over-analyze everything?	I think too much into every conceivable situation and doing so makes me quite a suspicious and mistrusting person, especially as I can be frequently correct in my suspicions. I don't want to be like this at all it gets me down,       Why are some people like this and is there anything I can do to change it?
20090202185756AA30hbM	Social Science;Psychology	Should I go to therapy?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20090202185621AARva0S	Social Science;Psychology	My father died today..?	..and I called one of my best friends; I asked if he would come over. I am usually the type of person that wants to be left alone, but I didn't want to be today.( my family is several states away) My friend explained that he is just NOT good at those things--he would do anything, ANYTHING I needed but he just can't be around someone when they are grieving. he said it just stirs up the feelings when he lost his parents and felt that the last thing I needed was him crying too   He did call and we spent an hour or two on the phone.   Is this normal? what do you make of this? Are some people just really this way--or was he being selfish and uncaring?. He did say he would call me tomorrow and check on me.      I'm female if that makes a difference.      thank you

20090202190724AA4GwCX	Social Science;Psychology	Hypnosis in the hands of the layman?	From what I've read from blogs, Yahoo Answers, and the Journal of Psychology, hypnosis has been shown to be a safe. However, in my research, I have found nobody who talks about the safety of hypnosis in the hands of a layman.      With some research on the Internet, one can easily learn how to hypnotize his friends for fun. However, is this safe? Could negative side-effects arise? If it's possible for something to go wrong, the lay-hypnotist might not recognize it... and if so, he most likely won't know how to correct it.      So, my question is... is it safe to play with hypnosis? Should one receive training before trying to hypnotize his friends... or is it alright to play with hypnosis after reading a few web pages?

Is money "the problem" in the land of plenty else?

B) substitute goods and the higher price for oil increased the demand for coal.   C) complementary goods and the higher price for oil decreased the supply of coal.

20090202192835AAN1icN	Social Science;Psychology	Would he feel more connected to me for these reasons? Would this make him more inclined to like me?	Okay, last November I went to an indoor tennis clinic, and there was a guy checking me out A LOT. He would look me right in the eyes and then look away. Basically, i totally got the sense that he liked me. Believe it or not, he was TOTALLY my type! He is a geek w/ glasses, he has curly dark brown hair, he was kinda stocky/quite built. He is extremely Jewish looking, and has a huge, hooked nose. He is about 5'7. At the tennis place, i would usually wear cute little tennis outfits, but i always wore my glasses (i cannot play tennis w/o them!). I also have brown curly hair (that i usually tied baq when playing tennis), and i had a HUGE HOOKED BEAKY nose. I was quite Jewish looking as well. I am 5'4 1/2. I have tics (i sniff and i move my head to the side), and believe it or not, this sexy dude has tics as well (he sniffs and he blinks). Would my similar looks to this guy (and my tics) make him more inclined to liking me?    Wait... it continues. This summer i got my nose fixed (and now it is anything BUT hooked). Then, i started volunteering somehwere and he volunteers there too! When i volunteer, i never have my glasses on or look geeky. I usually wear tight, victoria's secret PINK or hard tail pants, a couple of times i wore a juicy couture jacket, and two times i wore a low cut cleavage shirt. I carry a Betsey Johnson bag when i volunteer. Lately, this guy usually sees me with my hair straight, or down underneath a cute little bucket hat. Do you think he probably likes me more now, or does he feel like he cannot connect with me as much? (yes, i still have the tics!) I am 17 y/o & he is 16 y/o.
