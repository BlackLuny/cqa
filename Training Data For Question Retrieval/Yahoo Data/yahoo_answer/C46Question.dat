20090223130744AAo2jDe	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do crippled people still have the right to drink?	I know the obvious answer is yes, you can't take away someone's rights just because they are crippled....but I was thinking today, and say they were "walking" home from a bar, on their wheel chair, couldn't they get a DUI for that? I mean, I heard of someone getting a DUI for being drunk on a bicycle, so its not like there has to be a motor (which is what i used to think) but even if it does have to be a motor vehicle, what about power chairs? Can someone get a dui for driving a power chair under the influence? this doesn't exactly seem fair, but its still a motor vehicle...right?   My opinion is...that probably you legally can get DUI for that, but no cop is gonna be that much of a prick and give one out....but who knows?   Any lawyers or anything actually know the answer?   Or anybody else want to put any input?

Well, the magazine has not come yet and it has been 120 days - the time when it should start coming. I tried calling the customer service number on my receipt but it went to voice mail and the mail box is full.

Is there someone I can contact?
20090223130807AAmwd2i	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Idea for protecting the wrongfully accused - Speeding?	I have had this idea a while now, after enforcing traffic in the front seat of a patrol vehicle, and by being stopped once by the California Highway Patrol.      There are many times when I sit on the side of the road, clocking vehicles making traffic stops for speeds in excess of 15+ in populated areas. This made me wonder one day.      If there are no witnesses, and the "violator" who we will call Steve, has no proof like a video camera, GPS, or something to track his speed, then a Police Officer can stop Steve even if he is doing the speed limit, and write Steve a citation for doing 90 MPH in a 65, and there is nothing Steve could do.      This made me wonder about an idea, I would like the community to comment on;      I believe that future radar/lidar guns should be installed with a memory chip or printer device of some sort, that makes it to where whenever a law enforcement officer clocks a vehicle, and decides to stop, he can print the slip out of the radar gun/save a read-only text file, with the Date - Time - Speed of Vehicle - and Officer ID/Badge# to use in court.      This would both help the Officers in valid stops that speeders contest, AND help the wrongfully accused, like Steve.      If the Officer shows up to Traffic Court without the Radar-Slip, then it is the Officer's job to prove the vehicle was speeding, not the violator's job to prove he wasn't speeding.      Trust me, working our shifts with nothing to do for hours on end makes you wonder these things. Scary enough, it's true.      I'm sure there's been people who have actually been wrongfully convicted of speeding.
20090223131005AAGQBsW	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Ethics about accusations?	Recently I took care of my neighbors dog for 1 week. I was told to come 10 minutes just to let the dog out (daughter comes home at night to feed them), and instead everyday I was there for 40 minutes playing with them etc. (this is not the first time I took care of their dogs - so they must think I do a fine job or they would not call me again - and money is not an issue for them, they can take the dogs to a vet for boarding).    When they came back the son (who is a snob possibly from being spoiled) made a remark to me that was bothersome. he said, "what did you neglect the dogs, you horrible person." when I told him I went every day he said "oh, well then was it to steal things from our house?" First off, I would not steal from anyone- let alone a neighbor, and two, I love animals and enjoyed taking care of their dogs (the rest of the family is very nice and pleasant as well).    None-the-less, I am trying to think of how to deal with this situation. I was thinking if the mother calls again to ask me to take care of their dogs- I would tell her I do not even feel comfortable after being accused of neglecting their dogs by one of her sons, I would say there obviously has to be trust in a situation like this and what was said was insulting and do not feel comfortable anymore, and that I am sorry..       Would that be inappropriate? It is kind of getting back indirectly at the son but at the same time letting them know that I am an honest person. Any other ideas?    thanks

Wall Street loved Bush right up until the capital markets imploded. Before that, many Wall Street analysts said that Clinton's tax hikes would decimate the economy - they actually directly created the 1990s private investment boom.      Given their demonstrated ineptitude at forecasting the success or failure of government policies, why on earth would anyone think the short-term reaction of speculators is a good indicator of the success or failure of Obama's agenda?      It's kind of like if one were to repeatedly take their car into a shop for an oil change, and the shop repeatedly breaks something, necessitating costly repairs. What sane person would continue to go back to them for advice on cars?

We could then e-mail what idea you think is best to the White house and maybe they would listen.        On the bad mortgages they should allow an affordable payment and put the excess on the end of the mortgage.

Despite protest from MP's the government has marched forward on ID cards and  fingerprinting.      Last month it became permissable for British Police investigators to 'hack' anyone's computer remotely without a warrant. they could be looking at your website history, your hard drive files, your documents and emails right now.

Reasons Obama is the next  Bush   - He wants to increase military spending!   - He wants to subsidize insurance companies (problem in SiCKO)   - He wants to bail out big business   - He wants to inflate the money supply with his stimulus plan   - He has many of the same advisors   - He wants war in the name of peace (just like bush)   - His campaign funding came from big business and electricity, and the rest were the same as McCain's funders   - He claims he wants to unify the congress (like Bush said)   - He wont bring the troops home!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...      Obama is a neo-liberal, and like neo-conservatives he wants bigger government. Cutting taxes without decreasing spending is what reaganomics is all about, and it has a bad track record! Why did anyone vote for this incompetent hack Yesman!

20090223145655AAkAfYV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	A possible case of elderly abuse...? What is your opinion?	I am a CNA and work for a Home Health Agency, and I have this elderly patient that showed up with some ugly bruises in 2 fingers (left hand) and wrist. This is not the first time. I had reported to my agency the time before, and now reported again. The bruises are dark purplish-red. I left my patient's house on Thursday and the bruises were not there. Then on Friday they were there. I asked her, but she can't remember (she has Alzheimer's and Dementia). I asked her daughter and son, none of them could give me an answer. They don't seem very concern with her bruises. I can't prove anybody did anything, but they surely look suspicious. My patient has told me many times when we're alone that she wished she would disappear and never came back home. She is very unhappy at home, since nobody really talks to her, unless when she does something wrong, then they yell at her. So today my agency called the daughter and she was MAD because she said I accused her of abusing her mother. I told her I never accuse anybody of anything, it's just my job to report any changes in her mom's condition (bruises, pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc). She said "I don't want DCF - Dept Children and Families - in it. They were after us once and I don't want to go through this thing again. I am not abusing my mom!" (she said this yelling at me). She said "I hope you will still have your job tomorrow". She insinuated that I did wrong by reporting the bruises and that the agency would fire me. But I'm just following the policies of the company. What is your opinion in this matter? Do you think they are already investigating this? I hope so!!!

I've been in Southern CA for most of my life.   I never really enjoyed what this place has to offer.  I'm not a surfer, party girl, or an actress or enjoy sitting in traffic for hours.  I'm looking to start a family soon.  I recently realized when I bought a house  this is no place to raise a family.  There are jobs. But, I couldn't possibly make enough money to own a home in centrally located, safe communities ie Pasadena or Burbank.  Unless you are making $100,000 or over, you have to live 30 miles away from los angeles and deal with the traffic 7 days a week. Do you know how long that commute is?  A 45 minute commute on a train would be heaven! I'm tired of the freeways, inadequate public transportation, and everything being so far apart!  By the time you fight through all the traffic to get someplace, you can't even enjoy the night b/c businesses close way too early or you have to get out of an area before dark because it gets too dangerous.    For a so called ethnically diverse county - race relations aren't good.  It isn't even all that diverse!   Gang culture and presence is way too evident in alot of places.  Many places I go to, I feel like I'm in a third world country - and not in a good way. Everyone keeps to themselves.  For all these inconveniences, I'm wondering if I could have a better quality of life in another state.  My husband's line of work makes it necessary for him to live near a big city with a biotech industry.  Is there a city/state with better public transportation, good schools, w/o ridiculously high prices like Manhattan, and is ethnically diverse?  Anyone from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, or South Carolina - please submit your 2 cents.  Am I looking for something that doesn't exist?

Regardless of age, autoworkers get full 80 percent pension and benefits after 30 years on the job. Why should the rest of us taxpayers -- who don't get the same privilege -- help GM cover those costs? We already pay an extra 1500 dollars for when we buy a new car just to cover their health benefits. Remember, most of us have to work till age 67 to draw full SS after paying into it for over 40 years and then we only receive about 25 percent for the best 5 years of employment. I think that those tax dollars should go into our SS so that we can all retire after 30 years with 80 percent of our pay and not into their retirement.    Tell me where I’m wrong?

Out of rehab meaning she keeps getting kicked out. The have had multiple orders stating she must complete treatment, and multiple times, shes failed. They have a current order, thats states she must complete treatment, and is allowed supervised visits. Well, once again, she was kicked out of rehab (reason unknown) so my boyfriend stopped letting her see her daughter until she gets back into treatment. She doesnt want to go back to treatment! She filed him in contempt of court. His lawyer said it is okay for him to take away her visitations. Is he right? I don't want him to get in trouble but his lawyer said it is okay. She violated the order, but is he? He suspects she is using again, and she wont go back to treatment. If he is wrong, what could happen. By the way, she is only allowed to see her every 2 weeks for Saturday and Sunday she has missed only 2 of her visitations so far...

Ok, so today in my health science technology class my teacher told us that in places such as England, Canada, etc. they have socialist medicine. So for an example she said that if they had renal (kidney) failure the patient would be taken off of the support given by the hospital needed, like IV's, respirators, and things of that sort. So I asked my mom about that, saying how I don't believe that is entirely fair to that person and their choice of living should be up to the government. She also said that Obama is FOR socialist medicine, meaning that he wants to do the same....is that true? And if so, what single advantage comes with that to the PEOPLE, not the government? I know that would be less taxes and medical bills that the government would have to pay for and would save their money, however what good would that do for the people of America?      Also the other day I heard that Obama would pay for worldwide abortions, meaning in other places than America, so would he pay for foreign country's abortion and not our own medical bills for those who have the capability to recover but can't just because the government has a risk involved with them benefitting from this person's recovery?      Just a few questions, and don't criticize if I am wrong, that's the point of asking a questions - to help clear things up.      Thanks in advance for any help given.

20090223151806AAbIDfP	Politics & Government;Politics	Conservatives - what characteristic or institution determines whether an economy is socialist or capitalist?	Provided you take the two to be mutually exclusive, of course.      In my opinion, which tends to be the definite majority opinion amongst the experts, the key determinant between capitalism and central planning is capital allocation. In other words, the presence or absence of, at minimum, a stock market. So, in China, while the state still controls nearly 75% of the economy, because they rely on market forces to direct economic activity, it is a capitalist economy now.      However, the line is exceedingly blurry. Japan, for instance, is almost always seen as a capitalist economy; however, the Ministry of Finance is heavily and directly involved in the capital markets. This is apparent to anyone watching a large-cap stock on the Nikkei, which will often hover at arbitrary prices for arbitrary times. You might even say that Japan is a centrally-planned market economy, even though it's sort of a contradiction in terms.      So, what is your opinion? At what specific point does an economy cease to be socialist and become capitalist, or vice-versa?

I know I have nothing to really worry about because we do love one another and we are legitimate but I just worry that we will say something wrong or somehow make the interviewers doubt us (I love my husband dearly and do not want to lose him) I understand the process and think it is good to have the interviews etc to prove the legitimacy of marriages, however if they were very concerned about it why do they not do interviews in the couples home? I'm not saying to all couples applying but just pop in to the ones they doubt or to the randomly chosen ones (it may cost more money and be more man hours but don't you think it would be easier to find the liars?) I mean in someones home you can see whats going on (are both people living there? whats going on when the agents arrive? etc.) Wouldn't it be easier in some ways to catch the liars that way?

20090223151811AAa2i7Z	Politics & Government;Politics	Has anyone seen the connection between stock market declines and Obamanomics?	After two years of campaigning talking down the economy, and eight years of fighting republican attempts to get Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under control, (Ron Paul warned over ten years ago, no one listened) the democrats are now calling anyone who says negative things about the economy unpatriotic. Sure giving banks more money and forcing them to make more risky loans will somehow work better this time than last? Thats like creating peace in the Middle East by importing thousands more Hamas supporters, more people to dance in the streets if we suffer another 911? When Uhbama won, the market hit record lows, clawed back, he unveils his economic team, and his plan, and now the market has hit the skids. Time will tell, but paying off half the deficit (unless Uhbama just means the "inherited" deficit, not his new spending) is impossible without taxation, market manipulation and confiscation never seen before in our country. I will glady, over joyously, like to be wrong. Since we first heard of Uhbama my IRA has gone downhill. But I'm just bitter because I didn't get a loan to buy a house I can't afford. But this way the Hamas supporters will have some place to live, on taxpayer support of course.

World wars one and two involved opposing power blocs, a major power or two entering the war late (ie the USA, Japan in the second), and a spark to ignite the conflict. Assuming World War 3 followed the same pattern, which countries do you predict would comprise the power blocs, which power would enter the war late, and what could the spark be?       Aspects you may wish to consider in your scenario are: NATO - would this be one of the power blocs, or would it have fractured? Would Russia have expanded into its former Soviet Union territories and be one of the power blocs? Would new major military powers form a power bloc, such as Iran or Pakistan? Is the Middle East the most likely spark? Most important of all, would the conflict go nuclear?

Imagine that you cannot feed your family and you get very sick and die from unsanitary conditions.       Wealth inequality leads to injustice, where one person has millions to spare and another has not enough to survive.       Because capitalism thrives on exploitation, it does not regard ethics. It allows people in impoverished nations to DIE. If we change the economic system to such a one in which everyone has access to equal resources, we could prevent countless deaths. But this cannot happen if people seem to glorify capitalism...      Do you like it when people die because of this "great" economic system...?

Up until this past year they have lived in different states and everything was great but once they moved in together things went down hill.  Hes a good guy so hes been helping her get her citizenship by being her sponsor.  Hes says she pays for all the fees and he just signs what she gives him.  But for some reason they have to live together until the process is done and it is taking months longer than what he thought it would leaving both of them wanting out of the relationship but stuck. What type of sponsorship is this?  I have researched and I thought you either have to be sponsored by an employer, a family member or get married.  What type requires them to have to live in the same household?  If you can please site where helpful info can be found.  Thanks

Morenos, ******, afromestizos o afromexicanos no son sólo palabras compuestas; se trata de seres humanos quienes conocen que su origen es de áfrica, que fueron traídos como esclavos, y que aquí en México se mezclaron con personas blancas e indígenas.   La mayoría, que se calcula entre 2% y 9% de la población total, radica en los estados de Oaxaca, Guerrero y Veracruz, y aún es víctima de discriminación, condiciones de marginalidad, pobreza y exclusión.         La población negra en el país ha quedado fuera de la cultura nacional, de acuerdo con estudios del Instituto de Investigaciones Jurídicas de la UNAM.   La discriminación silenciosa, que se combina con la "invisibilidad" de los ******, lejos de revertirse se acentúa. "En toda sociedad las minorías son olvidadas y en México no es la excepción", dice el sacerdote misionero Glyn Jemmott, quien trabaja en El Ciruelo, Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, pueblo con elevada comunidad afromexicana.

Creció en una familia muy pobre, cerca del lago Lanín, en San Martín de los Andes, a unos 400 kilómetros de Neuquén. En esa ciudad hizo la escuela primaria,  la secundaria en un industrial de Neuquén varios a?os más tarde. Ahí se recibió de técnico químico, empezó a trabajar para mantenerse y como pudo intentó empezar a ser docente.   Trabajó en uno de los barrios más pobres del oeste de Neuquén, hace dos a?os se recibió de docente, y desde entonces acompa?ó la lucha sindical.   Carlos ahora tenía 40 a?os, dos hijas de 10 y 14 a?os y apenas un par de a?os de docente recibido. En estos a?os de todos modos hizo de su entrega un compromiso. Los maestros de la Cuenca lo eligieron delegado gremial y los alumnos le dieron el a?o pasado el premio del “rey del colegio” como mejor profesor. Con su mujer compartieron los acuerdos por este y otros muchos piquetes, con turnos alternados para cuidar a las hijas. Ella se quedó en casa, él se fue.

My three points are    1. Public are too caught up in their own lives to vote or partake every time a bill needs to get passed.   2. Public are not knowledgeable enough when it comes to politics.   3. Things would get pretty chaotic.

What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality.       How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence? Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep? Is not man's greatest sin to have been born? What duty is there to continue to live? We did not choose to be born.      Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire?      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.      So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

Guy never mentioned having sex with this woman in any of their conversations. Then all of a sudden now comes forward saying he wants the baby.

If you could please name certain cases and laws so I can find them and print them and send them to him, and perhaps depending on the seriousness contact my attorney.

This is my writing so far, please do not use it, I just need ideas   President Wilson was a Princeton graduate with democratic views. He served as president during World War I and in the aftermath of World War I. He headed the creation of the treaty of Versailles and created the fourteen points that he presented to the United States Congress. At the time, the United States congress was republican. Therefore, democratic Wilson and his congress shared separate views on what should be done to create peace after World War I.    One main point that Wilson presented to congress in the fourteen points was the League of Nations. The League of Nations was an “international organization, formed after World War I, that aimed to promote security and peace for all members.”  It was a plan that could be described as President Wilsons “baby”. The United States Congress was very against this plan. Without both congress and Wilson agreeing, the United States Would not be part of the League of Nations. Neither Congress nor President Wilson did agree and President Wilson refused to rethink his plans. Therefore, the fact that Wilson was stubborn to rethink and change his views to go along with Congress is the reason that the treaty of Versailles was killed.        thanks,   J

Hola a todos, en mi casa hay gran discusión sobre la nueva causal del aborto en el DF que es económica. Permitirlo porque afecta el plan de vida de la mujer.      Ese enfoque me parece incompleto, creo que debe decir: afecta el plan de vida de la pareja.      Leí en el REFORMA que la Asociación a Abogados Católicos va a pedir horarios más flexibles para los padres varónes que tengan bebé en camino. Esa proposición me parece más avanzada...que opinan?      Ya se que las feministas me van a matar, pero creo que el aborto es una decisión de dos, pues dos son los que participan en una relación.

S    Todos sabéis que el sábado pasado, 17 de marzo, UPN (PP) se manifestó, invadiendo las calles de Pamplona, bajo el lema "fueros y libertad. Navarra no es negociable", unidos de la mano del PP, falangistas y los grupos de Ynestrillas. Cuál es mi indignación cuando hoy se hacen públicos los gastos que han supuesto dicha manifestación aberrante... ojo al dato, que es escalofriante:      59.850 euros en cu?as de radio y anuncios de prensa. (Publicidad mediática)   73.750 euros en banderas y pines no nacionalistas.   60.000 euros por hora y media del escenario e infraestructuras......   (Merchandising) Más de 10 kilos en banderitas y pines.   (Helicópteros) 900 euros a la hora de imágenes aéreas para la televisión que asciende a *7200 euros *en total      El Gobierno de Navarra se dejó: (continua)         *35000 euros* en autobuses, para que salieran de manera gratuita desde distintos puntos de Navarra.   *60000 euros *en escenario e infraestructuras.    *45000 euros* para que pudieran venir autobuses desde fuera.

20070711065005AAGnwps	Politics & Government;Government	?México es el único país que viola su Carta Magna al cobrar por un servicio que está obligado a proporcionar?	Desde el gobierno del botudo Fox se estableció el Seguro Popular, en el cual se oferta un mínimo de servicios de Salud por una cuota anual. Lo grave del asunto es que los servicios que se proporcionan son programas elementales como las inmunizaciones, control del ni?o sano, atención del embarazo y algunos más. Pero es increíble que el gobierno no entienda que los recursos que recauda de los impuestos son precisamente para OTORGAR SEGURIDAD Y PREVISION SOCIAL AL PUEBLO y no le está haciendo NINGUN favor al pueblo al dar ese servicio que la misma Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos lo obliga.   Algunas inmunizaciones y programas de Salud que otorga el Seguro Popular son, inclusive, con subsidio internacional de la OMS.   ?Esta es la gran política que oferta el PRIAN?

Habiéndose cerrado las fuentes convenciona-   les de financiamiento internacional y acosado por una crisis de liquidez,, Kirchner volvió a vender su alma al mi-coronel venezolano, ofreciéndole en venta otros mil millones de dólares en títulos.   Entre títulos y otras donaciones, ya suman más de seis mil millones de dólares del pueblo venezola-   no que Chávez puso en Argentina (obviamente,sin   consultarle a nadie, como si el dinero fuera suyo).   La esplendidez de Chávez con Argentina no tiene   par en el mundo. Ni siquiera Fidel Castro, su dicta-   dor favorito, le ha merecido tantas atenciones.   Kirchner, por su parte, está cabildeando frenetica-   mente con quienes no lo quieren, para facilitar el   ingreso de Venezuela al moribundo Mercosur.

Desde el liberalismo moderno se tomó el concepto para ser manipulado por los gobiernos, para enga?ar a los pueblos, para aumentar las desigualdades, para SUSTENTAR UN ORDEN ESTABLECIDO QUE PARA NADA CORRESPONDE A LOS INTERESES DE LA HUMANIDAD.
