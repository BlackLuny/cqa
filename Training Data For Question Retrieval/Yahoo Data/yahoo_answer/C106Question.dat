This would include goods made by American companies who have opened and tied in with Chinese companies to make their goods.

When we got divorced my son was enrolled in my ex's school district. I kept it that way thinking it would be better for my son. For three years I traveled back and forth to pick up and bring my kids to school on my days, plus taking them to appointments, parent teacher conferences, activities while my ex did nothing since his license is suspended. My ex moved to my district area and the kids got enrolled in school. Again he lived 10 minutes away from the school so I had to pick up and drop off the kids for him on his days or else the kids would not get to school. He now wants to move back to  the area where he originally lived and wants to take the kids and enroll them in his school district. I feel like I should not have to cater to him anymore. Is there anything that I can do. I told him that I felt that it was not fair that I have to travel all the time because he does not have a vehicle. Keep in mind that he is not very supportive of my kids and there activities in school and has not been to one parent teacher confrence. He does not seem to care. HELP!!!

My boyfriend was petitioned by his sister (who is a U.S citizen) in April 2001 using the I-130 with 245(i) protection law.  His I-130 application was received APRIL 30, 2001 & approved by USCIS in NOV.2005. An approval notice was sent but never received by his sister. My boyfriend has been checking his status online.  The status has not changed since NOV. 2005. USCIS processing dates as of January 2009 for an I-130 Petition by U.S. Citizen filing for a Brother is MAY 30, 2001. This processing date represents the RECEIVED dates of petitions. My boyfriend’s petition was received prior to this date. A few questions:   (1) Does he need the Approval Notice for any other reason or verification purpose? Should he request a duplicate?  ((USCIS requires $340 to request a duplicate Approval Notice))   (2) What’s the next step & how much longer?     (3) My boyfriend has been living in the U.S. since he was 5 years old, brought here by his parents. He has never been in trouble other than a couple traffic tickets. He has never been arrested or deported. Does he have to wait for an Immigrant Visa from NVC?   (4) My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 7 years now.

If we were to get married, Can I petition him as a spouse & add the petition to his already pending one with his sister? Would this speed up the process? Or will he start all over again?    Thanks

"Fifty-three percent of American voters voted for Barack Obama; 46% voted for John McCain, and 1% voted for wackos. Give that 1% to President Obama. Let's say the vote was 54% to 46%. As a way to bring the country together and at the same time determine the most effective way to deal with recessions, under the Obama-Limbaugh Stimulus Plan of 2009: 54% of the $900 billion -- $486 billion -- will be spent on infrastructure and pork as defined by Mr. Obama and the Democrats; 46% -- $414 billion -- will be directed toward tax cuts, as determined by me."

20090129052249AAKmrXk	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	When Ted Kennedy got sick, did he stand in line at a public health clinic?	the way he expects us to? Remember, he is one of the main supporters of nationalized health care but chose a private hospital because he 'deserves' quality treatment!      Here's another example of our 'Royalty' on capitol hill...   This is interesting...       Americans may be able to rest a little easier this April if Congressman John Carter, R-Texas gets his way.      Rep. Carter introduced a bill Wednesday to eliminate all IRS penalties and interest for paying taxes past due.      The legislation calls for the creation of what he calls the, "Rangel Rule," -- drawing attention to the recent legal issues of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., enabling citizens who fail to pay taxes on time to do so later with no additional fees.      Rangel, who writes the country's tax policies, acknowledged last fall that he failed to pay thousands in real estate taxes for rental income he earned from a property in the Dominican Republic.      As of September 2008 the Harlem Democrat reportedly paid back more than $10,000 in taxes but that did not include any IRS penalties.      "Your citizens back home should have the same rights and benefits that come to you as a member of congress. You shouldn't be treated any differently under the law than your citizens back home," Carter said.      He added that citizens should receive the "same courtesy" that the IRS is allegedly granting Rangel and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who also recently acknowledged a failure to pay taxes.      Carter penned a letter to Rangel earlier this month requesting that he either pay the IRS fees or join him in co-sponsoring the legislation establishing the rule.      "As Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, I believe you set an example for all American taxpayers in your dealings with the IRS, and that you must do so in a way that enforces blind justice without regard to wealth or status," he wrote in the January 6th missive.      A spokesman for the New York Democrat would not comment on the state of the tax issue, which is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, but did respond to the Carter bill.      "This legislation is unnecessary. All taxpayers currently receive equal treatment under the law," Rangel spokesman Emile Milne said.            full story...       http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/... 
20090129051958AAo1vOr	Politics & Government;Politics	Economic "crisis": The most logical thing to do?	While creepy speeches about a global currency and global economics abound, and the US government takes the opportunity during the country's moment of great weakness to pass a "stimulus package," that is NOT to strengthen the country's infrastructure, but instead, the government's infrastructure, which amounts to nothing less than a treasonous act, what else is there to do but localize to the extreme, and quit living on credit....liquidate and live within our means?      The government perpetuates recessions and depressions with their propping up of an IOU economy, printing money as they please, and then the inflation (our debt = their profit) that ensues. They can not create wealth so they just print up promise notes and demand that the real wealth creators, the producers (the people) accept them as full value.       Isn't it time that self-reliance becomes the new mass political movement? I am not talking about a political party, but instead, the people. The more localized economies are, the less exchange there is, the less REAL money the government gets, and also, the less they are able to pretend to be a REAL participant in this economy because localizing will be more secure than their CRISIS system that they use to further their own expansion.      I say grassroots with real value (products/services)      What do you think?

With assets and personal investments over one million dollars he is in fact the poorest of the millionaires in the election of 2008."      How can someone be a millionaire and be poor?

20090129045955AA1jrNJ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	You MUST know this if you're an organ donor......?	The following occurred in Illinois.      Recently, a young married man unexpectedly passed away in a local emergency room. He had signed up to be an organ donor. Within moments of his passing, the nurse inundated his wife, questioning her which organs they could take, organ by organ. Eyes? Skin? Veins? Liver? Heart? Etc., etc. The nurse was apologetic but extremely pressing and hurried in her questions because she said they had twenty minutes before the organs because useless. Thus, the questioning had to take place quickly and immediately. The wife said it was absolutely horrible – here she was dealing with the sudden death of her husband, and at the same time, feeling she was desecrating the body. After a few minutes of this trauma, the wife said, “I have to stop. I can’t do this.”        No one tells us this when we sign up to be organ donors. Second, the spouse can change the desires of the donor and refuse the organs.      Wouldn’t it make more sense that when we sign up to be donors, we fill out a checklist of organs we’re willing to donate, so loved ones don’t have to go through this trauma? This list can be easily accessed because it could be in a variety of areas:  in the possession of all local hospitals, available on the internet, etc. That way, no questions need to be asked. Loved ones only need to be told that the process is underway as per the instruction of the deceased.      Also, should loved ones be allowed to refuse the organs?      People need to be made aware of the above, and someone needs to do something about this.        Suggestions?

In a 1944 speech he said:      "The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened." He went on to say: "I no longer need to run as a presidential candidate for the Socialist Party. The Democrat Party has adopted our platform."

20090129050550AAOMDc7	Politics & Government;Immigration	Will this work for us here in america?	When a company falls on difficult times, one of the things that seems to happen is they reduce their staff and workers. The remaining workers have to find ways to continue to do a good job or risk that their job would also be eliminated. Wall street, and the media, normally congratulate the CEO for making this type of "tough decision," and his board of directors gives him a big bonus.       Our government should not be immune from similar risks.        Therefore: Reduce the House of Representatives from the current 435 members to 218 members and Senate members from 100 to 50 (one per State). Also reduce remaining staff by at least 25%.        Accomplish this over the next 8 years (two steps/two elections) and of course this would require some redistricting.      Some Yearly Monetary Gains Include:      $44,108,400 for elimination of base pay for congress. (267 members X $165,200 pay/member/yr.)      $97,175,000 for elimination of the above people's staffs (estimate $1.3 Million in staff per each member of the House, and $3 Million in staff per each member of the Senate every year).      $240,294 for the reduction in remaining staff by 25%.       $7,500,000,000 reduction in pork barrel ear-marks each year (those members whose jobs are gone. Current estimates for total government pork earmarks are at $15 Billion/yr).      The remaining representatives would need to work smarter and would need to improve efficiencies. It might even be in their best interests to work together for the good of our country!       We may also expect that smaller committees might lead to a more efficient resolution of issues as well. It would be easier to keep track of what your representative is doing.       Congress has more tools available to do their jobs than it had back in 1911 when the current number of representatives was established  (telephone, computers, cell phones to name a few).      Note:    Congress did not hesitate to head home when it was a holiday, when the nation needed a real fix to the economic problems. Also, we have 3 senators that have not been doing their jobs for the past 18+ months (on the campaign trail) and still they all have been accepting full pay. These facts alone support a reduction in senators & congress.      Summary of opportunity:      $44,108,400 reduction of congress members.      $282,100,000 for elimination of the reduced house member staff.       $150,000,000 for elimination of reduced senate member staff.       $59,675,000 for 25% reduction of staff for remaining house members.       $37,500,000 for 25% reduction of staff for remaining senate members.       $7,500,000,000 reduction in pork added to bills by the reduction of congress members.       $8,073,383,400 per year, estimated total savings.          Big business does these types of cuts all the time.      If Congresspersons were required to serve 20, 25, or 30 years (like everyone else) in order to collect retirement benefits, there is no telling how much we would save. Now they get full retirement after serving only ONE term.                     I also think they should all be limited to 2 terms.

Like many other Americans, I am deeply disappointed in this year's Presidential election.  I am disgusted at the main stream media for making Obama into a rock star.  What I have the most problem with is singers, actors, etc... campaigning for a candidate.  Oprah used to be okay in my opinion, but after what she did to get Obama elected, I will NEVER give her another dollar, nor will I watch her show.  I am completely done with her.  I am also done with Bruce Springsteen.  I have always been a big fan and have all his music.  But this morning, I threw all his cds in the trash and deleted every song off itunes and my ipod.  I am done with him as well.  I have no respect for these two anymore.     Just because someone can sing or act, what makes them think the American people want them to help a candidate? They need to keep their opinions to themselves.  You don't see Garth Brooks, a registered Republican , out there campaigning for anyone.  Most of the stars in Hollywood and all around the U.S. are complete idiots, as well as the fanatics that follow them like they are a new god.     Like I said, I will never give anyone my money that has backed Obama.  Oprah decided she wanted him for President, and she did what she had to to get him elected.  Therefore, I hope she loses sponsors and fans.

How can we be so tired of the Iraq war but be so willing to go right back into Afghan and even Pakistan. I mean When does it stop? Are we going to invade every country that has the possibility of having "terrorist"? No country can be at war forever and not began to suffer the consequences. The Iraq started in 2003 that's 6 years and now sign of slowing down. I guess Obama must have forgot to tell us that he planned to do this in his campaign. Cause I damn sure would've had a problem with it! America will have enemies forever...For every terrorist they kill they create two more through civilian casualties. So when does it stop?       Please only give me intellectual responses you know with facts...If you just want to call me un-patriotic than answer me this "To be patriot of one's country does this mean I am devoted and love the people or the government? Does it mean to follow without question the acts of the government whose sole purpose is to represent you? Because if patriotism is devotion to one's government without question than I am not one. I will question and go against them when I feel they're actions are unjust...(kinda like the founding fathers and Britain if you think about it) :)

20090129055055AALoyf4	Politics & Government;Elections	So, what would the magic Republican economic stimulus be, that would not raise spending?	Consumers can't buy stuff to stimulate the economy.   Business can't hire, to stimulate the economy.   The Fed can't lower the rate any lower or manipulate the markets, to get the gears turning.      The one solution left is government spending, reckless spending.   It's what got us out of the Great Depression (buying tanks & bombs for WWII).      So, if Republicans oppose the economic stimulus....what would their solution be?          (Note:  Republican Congresses passed $300B economic stimulus bills in 2001 and 2002, and another was passed in 2008...all were signed by Bush.     The point:  the ONLY reason Republicans are complaining now is cause they don't get to say where the money is spent.)      ..............      I know tax cuts are going to be mentioned, so let me point out:      1.   Tax cuts to upper incomes DO NOT SERVE AS A STIMULUS, it just goes into savings and is never spent      2.  Tax cuts ARE SPENDING...we have to loan that just like spending

In Infantry AIT we do even more advanced training with M16, M4, M203, SAW, M240, 50. cal, claymore, C-4, and the AT4, all of these are also fired at the army basic training no matter what your MOS. And the army Combatives (UAC) is also some of the the best hand to hand combat training you can get anywhere. I am myself a level 2 and planning on going all the way to 4. Also people from other branches need to come to the army to get advanced training. I'm also extremely proud of Rangers, green berets, knowing that theres nothing that can come close to compare to these guys. So its easy to see the Army is by far the best fighting force in the world which would explain the amount of soldiers being sent to war is much higher because they want to send soldiers that know how to fight over there : )

"GOP Congressman Intros ‘Rangel Rule,’ Eliminating IRS Late Fees"      The legislation calls for the creation of what he calls the, "Rangel Rule," – drawing attention to the recent legal issues of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., enabling citizens who fail to pay taxes on time to do so later with no additional fees…      He added that citizens should receive the "same courtesy" that the IRS is allegedly granting Rangel and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who also recently acknowledged a failure to pay taxes.      Carter penned a letter to Rangel earlier this month requesting that he either pay the IRS fees or join him in co-sponsoring the legislation establishing the rule."      "As Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, I believe you set an example for all American taxpayers in your dealings with the IRS, and that you must do so in a way that enforces blind justice without regard to wealth or status," he wrote in the January 6th missive.'       http://sweetness-light.com/archive/gop-r...

20090129063053AAP4Vgc	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are politicians playing pay-back at the expense of the country?	They are acting like a bunch of little kids - just because they feel the Republicans screwed them for years, they are playing a dangerous game of 'pay-back' at the expense of the country.      In essence they are saying "we won, get over it, and now we're going to push through every ridiculous plan we can because you Republicans need to see how it feels".  All the while, nobody in Washington is paying attention to the 'will of the people'.  Many moderate Democrats and Independents are completely against the stimulus package, but they are not being represented.      I don't think this 'serves you right' philosophy is good for the country at all.  It's like some of the answers you see here - many valid questions are answered with 'we won, get over it', and they totally ignore the validity of the question.  In the meantime, 'we the people' will continue to suffer.       Can you explain how 'pay-back' just for the sake of a euphoric victory will solve our crisis?

Here's another example of our 'Royalty' on capitol hill...   This is interesting...      Americans may be able to rest a little easier this April if Congressman John Carter, R-Texas gets his way.      Rep. Carter introduced a bill Wednesday to eliminate all IRS penalties and interest for paying taxes past due.      The legislation calls for the creation of what he calls the, "Rangel Rule," -- drawing attention to the recent legal issues of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., enabling citizens who fail to pay taxes on time to do so later with no additional fees.      Rangel, who writes the country's tax policies, acknowledged last fall that he failed to pay thousands in real estate taxes for rental income he earned from a property in the Dominican Republic.      As of September 2008 the Harlem Democrat reportedly paid back more than $10,000 in taxes but that did not include any IRS penalties.      "Your citizens back home should have the same rights and benefits that come to you as a member of congress. You shouldn't be treated any differently under the law than your citizens back home," Carter said.      He added that citizens should receive the "same courtesy" that the IRS is allegedly granting Rangel and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who also recently acknowledged a failure to pay taxes.      Carter penned a letter to Rangel earlier this month requesting that he either pay the IRS fees or join him in co-sponsoring the legislation establishing the rule.      "As Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, I believe you set an example for all American taxpayers in your dealings with the IRS, and that you must do so in a way that enforces blind justice without regard to wealth or status," he wrote in the January 6th missive.      A spokesman for the New York Democrat would not comment on the state of the tax issue, which is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, but did respond to the Carter bill.      "This legislation is unnecessary. All taxpayers currently receive equal treatment under the law," Rangel spokesman Emile Milne said.            full story...       http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/...

Correct me if I am wrong, but is the term inherited not generally used when someone freely leaves something to someone else.      If I am not mistaken, all three, the Media, Hussein Obama and the Husseinites, All demanded that Hussein was the only one who could fix things.  That the world would come to an end if anyone else was elected.  Out of his own mouth, Hussein said over and over that HE was the right choice.  So how is that inherited?  He demanded the job and his supporters by their votes demanded that he be given the job and all that went with it.

Now when they (they being the media and  the Hussienites)  talk about his stimulus plan they phrase it as “This stimulus plan will save or create 3 million or more jobs.    Now that’s a smart tactic.  You can’t lose.  NO matter if no more than 500 jobs are started with the $825,000,000,000 tax dollars they want to poor down the drain, you can get off by saying ‘BUT it saved such and such  number of jobs’  And being the wonderful brown nosers that our media are, no one will even question it.  Except possible Rush and Fox.  Thank God for real reporting.      So How do you calculate ‘jobs saved’  just pull a number out of you’re a@@ that makes you fell good?

We used to swim on Tuesdays, but our pool is closed down due to a drain cover problem and will not open for a long time.       Sooooo.... I would like some ideas I can used for running P.T. that will make it a little more fun. One thing I have done in the past was a scavenger hunt run. There were 6 teams of 3 and each team got a clue and had to run to the next place to get the next clue etc. for a total of 7 clues which when you collected them all and got back to the start you could put them together like a puzzle and the first team to get the puzzle together won.        Every one in the unit loved it but it was a lot of work making up the clues, and going around before PT and placing all the clues. I would like something with the same kind of challenge but not as much work. I had thought about relay races, but I have a small unit and limited equipment.

We dont own the well its owned by this guy and we only pay 35 a month for water ( i know not alot) Well since we have been moved in we have not had water about 15 times so far in less then a year. Sometimes we dont have water for 30 mins sometimes up to a day and a half. Well our water went out last night and we called the guy and he still hasn't been out to fix it. I have a 21 month old son and i am 5 month pregnant with my daughter. If we didn't have kids i wouldn't be so upset but my son is sick and he needs water, and in june when my daughter comes im gonna need water for her bottles. Now i dont know how exactly to put this so bare with me, is there anything legally i can do to get him to fix the problem with the well? anything at all?

Failed predatory trickle-down economics now being propped-up and sending you and your grand children the debt burden.      Can't you see representative govt & business must be under our legal citizens direct rule & control making us true co-owners and any arising leader subject to being fired at will by the people.      The legal "change" in our constitution would be ending Republic of/by/for the wealthy & replacing it with a true direct valid democracy with daily issue submitting & voting etc. C-span 1 & 2 state and federal issues.

I don't know if other branches had this at the end of the test or not but for the navy there was an extra test about finding a number as fast as you can. They give you a name such as airport or something and it matches up with a 4 digit number such as 2005. There are 5 columns but it was really confusing because some numbers were in 2 or more columns. Maybe I didn't read the instructions carefully but I thought it was confusing. Anyway what was the point of that and how exactly were you to know which column was the right column?

I have to travel for work on a Friday, the flight comes back on a Sunday. My question is: Would/Should I be compensated for the Sunday? The commute itself is an 8-hour flight one way.    My employer wanted me to come the next day (Saturday), but it's almost ridiculous, due to the change of hour I would get only 3 hours of sleep, so I said that instead I wanted to come back Sunday to be more rested. My work schedule is normally Mon-Fri.   How does the the whole travel expense work? Moreover, does my employer have to pay my hours of flight back?   I searched the DOL but it says nothing about traveling during the wknd for work.   I appreciate your input, thanks you!

How is creating a bigger government, a greater tax and deficit burden, a stimulus to the economy?

It's the law that defines use of deadly force for people who invade your home, business, or vehicle. Recently it has been extended to cover your personal space in public as well. Before this everyone had the obligation to 'flee' when being assaulted in public but now if you have a concealed carry you can defend yourself with deadly force, even in public. What do you think? Would you rather try to flee from a brutal baseball bat beating or would you rather have the option to apply the Castle Law and use deadly force? Believe it or not, some people think this is a terrible law.

20090129060357AAUUOJ0	Politics & Government;Elections	Why would anyone call a plan full of pork a stimulus plan?	Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds   A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obama’s most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, you’d know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, I’d wager, does Barack Obama.   According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures — a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)         ACORN Is A Bad Seed   Something’s rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and…      ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.       ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.       ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for years—stretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.

WASHINGTON  Massive deficits could force the post office to cut out one day of mail delivery, the postmaster general told Congress on Wednesday, in asking lawmakers to lift the requirement that the agency deliver mail six days a week. If the change happens, that doesn't necessarily mean an end to Saturday mail delivery. Previous post office studies have looked at the possibility of skipping some other day when mail flow is light, such as Tuesday.    Faced with dwindling mail volume and rising costs, the post office was $2.8 billion in the red last year. "If current trends continue, we could experience a net loss of $6 billion or more this fiscal year," Postmaster General John E. Potter said in testimony for a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee.

I filed a claim for social security disability due to a foot condition as well as PTSD. Evey time I call my case worker to reply to letter that they sent to me  for more information he goes on about my age and the fact that it is more strict. Here is my written letter to document just one instance.      To whom it may concern,      Incident #1   On January 28th, 2009 I called my case worker regarding my claim for Social Security Disability benefits. I called to find out the status and also respond to a letter that was sent to me requesting more information. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX(case worker) requested the name of the Doctor recently treating me for my foot condition; I proceeded to tell him that all that information was provided on my original Social Security Disability claim. He said “you have been to a doctor since then” I said “no” then he proceeded to say “well it must not be that severe of a problem”      Firstly, it is not his place to make acquisitions on how bad my condition is. He does not live with it or me and no the day to day struggles I have to go through to complete any task because of it!       He proceeds to tell me that there are several jobs that I can do with my condition whether or not I have an education. He told me that I am able to work in a manufacturing plant, sitting without any education. Is he even basing my claim on my mental condition? My feet are only half of my disability; my mental condition is another large half. I struggle to go into public places and even associate with other people. I think in the past month or more I went into a store once for groceries. I don’t pump my own gas; I usually don’t grocery shop or even go into a convenient store.       Incident #2   This is the same day as above as well as the same conversation.   XXXXXXXXXXXX(case worker) stated to me that Social Security has stricter guidelines because of my age, if I was 50 or 55 my approval process would be less strict and the guidelines become more lenient.       I feel like I am being pushed in a corner and he is testing my mental condition, because of this I have been experiencing severe anger, rage, and have not slept since this conversation yesterday morning. I have already tried to contact his supervisor twice with getting only her voice mail and received no calls back after leaving messages.      On 01/28/2009 I went to the www.ssa.com website to research what I had been told by my case worker.      On the website nowhere did I find that the rules become more lenient as a person ages. The only thing I found is that it should be based on your condition as stated below.      “By law, Social Security has a very strict definition of disability. To be found disabled:   ? You must be unable to do any substantial work because of your medical condition(s); and   ? Your medical condition(s) must have lasted, or be expected to last, at least 1 year, or be   expected to result in your death.”      Also browsing through the site I found that my medical condition is on the “Listing of Impairments” under “12.00 Mental Disorders” “12.06 Anxiety-related disorders”  I also meet the requirements in both A and B are satisfied, or when the requirements in both A and C are satisfied.      I don’t understand why every time I call it is about my feet, age & that he thinks I’m capable! All illnesses need to be taken into consideration fairly.       I would like to request that I get a new case worker and no longer be discriminated against by your office.                     What does everyone think? Can I or can't I?

20090129061409AAtR12v	Politics & Government;Immigration	Ok does any pro-illegal guru have a real solution to the problem that is in the interest of the US as a whole?	My answer: Yes. The solution is to crack down on the corporate world that is employing illegals at less than minimum wage. The reason these folks have jobs is that they are willing to take less money than employers are legally required to pay U.S. citizens. If the jobs dry up, they go home. But companies that are interested in the bottom line and know they won't be penalized by a government that was elected by corporate contributions. (If we have public financing of elections, that will cease to be a problem.)      This works for the U.S. as a whole because:   1) Illegal immigrants have less of a motivation to come over here, and those that have come over will have trouble staying employed here.   2) It increases employment for American citizens.   3) It raises the minimum wage and gives working-class Americans a higher standard of living, expanding the middle class.   4) It makes corporations accountable and reduces cronyism and corruption.   5) A well-informed, voting middle class is the basis for a strong democracy.
20090129062126AAUCubJ	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Since tax cuts increase revenue in this country and every country that has tried it why would liberals raise?	Taxes?      Because "increased revenue," the Dow., etc., reveal very little about the standard of living of the average working-class or middle-class American, and because tax cuts have very little effect on just how much money the average working-class or middle-class American has on hand.      Allow me to explain.      Point One: Increased Revenue does not mean bettered lives.   Rationale: Say you take two samples of 10 people. In one sample, everyone in the group makes between $30,000 and $60,000 a year. In the second sample, you have three millionaires and seven people who are making less than $20,000 per year. Group A is undoubtedly the better-off group, as nobody is starving or working three jobs, and everyone is able to save a little bit for retirement. But if you were to compare revenue, Group B would sound better.      Point Two: Tax cuts have little or no relevance to how much working-class Americans are paid.   Rationale: Imagine you are the boss of a business. Your workers work for $50,000 a year. You know that after taxes, they really only take home about $30,000. As for you, you pay yourself $75,000.   Now some tax cuts have come along, and you already know your workers are going to work for $30,000. Will you keep their pay at $50,000, if that's now lost profitability for your company?   And since profitability for your company is really profit for you, won't you keep your salary right where it is?   So your company makes more profit, you make more money (because you get a tax cut), but nothing has changed for your workers. Sounds great, doesn't it?      Until -- OUCH! -- they stop having funding -- OUCH! -- for filling those potholes in the -- OUCH! -- street.      And your house catches fire and all the available fire engines are across town because they closed the local fire station.      And you lose your most talented employee because she has to go take care of her mother, who can no longer afford the medicine she's been getting thru Medicare, and her disease has progressed to the point she needs constant care.      But hey, they're your hard-earned dollars and you don't want the government spending them

My attorney never called back-so nearly two weeks later I fired him.  Now he's sending me cryptic emails telling me he has to file an Attorney Substitution form with the court-that it's legally required.  I told him I don't need a sub because I was dropping the case.  He still says I have to have a sub because their's an open case (the sub being me representing myself).  I don't understand why I have to have a substitute-why can't the case just be closed?  My attorney lied to me prior to this so I don't even know if I can trust him.  I just want this freaking mess to go away!!

We have our investments in cd's and gold and other typical low risk funds that traditionally dont take a beating in the bear markets. We also live in a house that is within our means.

20090129054550AA0FBwH	Politics & Government;Politics	When do you think Obama will bring up reparations for his ancestors?	Only 5% of the South owned slaves and I NEVER owned one.    Reparations By Another Name         In this transcript of a 2001 radio interview, Obama advocates redistribution (as in "stimulus package") as reparations for slavery and other injustices towards "previously dispossessed peoples".    MODERATOR:  Good morning and welcome to Odyssey on WBEZ Chicago 91.5 FM and were joined by Barack Obama who is Illinois State Senator from the 13th district and senior lecturer in the law school at the University of Chicago.    OBAMA:  If you look at the victories and failures of the civil rights movement and its litigation strategy in the court, I think where it succeeded was to vest formal rights in previously dispossessed peoples.  So that I would now have the right to vote, I would now be able to sit at the lunch counter and order and as long as I could pay for it Id be okay.    But the Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth and sort of more basic issues of political and economic justice in this society.  And to that extent as radical as people tried to characterize the Warren court, it wasnt that radical.    It didnt break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution, at least as its been interpreted, and the Warren court interpreted it in the same way that generally the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties.  It says what the states cant do to you, it says what the federal government cant do to you, but it doesnt say what the federal government or the state government must do on your behalf.  And that hasnt shifted.     One of the, I think tragedies of the civil rights movement was because the civil rights movement became so court focused, I think that there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributed change and in some ways we still suffer from that.

Referring to the difficult start of his own presidency in 1993, Clinton recalled how Republicans challenged his fiscal strategy at every turn but predicted that this time, some in the minority party of Congress would support Obama.       http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1009/4...

(Is that a threat? coming from Bubba and his wife is supposed to be "mending our relationships")      Clinton said the U.S. needed to assume global responsibility for the crisis, and for spurring international recovery, as called for Wednesday at the forum by Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.

20090129065740AALCi8a	Politics & Government;Politics	How is spending money on traditional Democratic govt funded programs a "stimulus"?	Is Congress headed into increasing the federal deficit without debate and sensible critical evaluation?  It seems so.  Obama spoke of level headed controls on the budget, and, acknowledged that the federal budget needed responsible management, and, in a debate, further suggested, his administration would go through evaluating programs as to their worthiness with a jaded and responsible eye.      Now, here he is, 9 days after his inauguration, spending like a drunken sailor on leave of his senses.       I am not given to partisanship easily, but this spending package is utterly absurd.  For example, the education budget is being DOUBLED in the package the House passed yesterday.  Federal programs, smaller ones not at the Departmental level, and not noticed by media, are being doubled all over the place.  People are saying folks were irresponsible in the past, and this led us to a recession.  How is this spending bill responsible fiscally?      This is the most irresponsible piece of legislation proposed by Congress and approved by a President I have witnessed since 1980.
20090129071313AAnHBsG	Politics & Government;Politics	5.2 Million Dollars in the Stimulus Plan for ACORN?	At the same time they are being investigated for voting fraud. Does one explain the other? It was ACORN's lawsuit turning Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae into part of the affirmative action program (mortgages for people who can't get one because they can't pay it or even a down payment) that caused this global financial crisis. To give credit where due it was HUD Secretary Andrew Coumo changing the rules so they could re bundle the bad loans with the good, and peddle them on the open global market is what really suckered in the world banks. This was about 12 years ago, Obama was an attorney, Bush was just a governor in Texas, Clinton and many of the "new" faces in Washington, were there then, Barney Frank was sleeping with the Fannie Mae chairperson, and everyone was happy.................Nothing could go wrong, right? So is giving that money to ACORN now legit or just political kickback at the expense of US, our children, grandchildren, etc. who are expected to repay China that money someday?

20090129071722AASMpWV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How is best way to handle this?	A week ago my 13 yr old son and another 13 yr old walked to a new car dealership. The dealership was closed, due to it being MLK day,  and neither boy was supposed to go there. While there they found several cars unlocked and was "checking them out". They got in a 2008 Corvette and when they shut they door they were locked in. To open the door from the inside you have to push the unlock button and simultaniously push another button on the grab bar or the door will not open. Neither boy knew how to open the door to get out and when they could not figure out how to get the door to open my son freaked out. So he began kicking the side window until it broke and they climbed out. Neither boy said anything to me about it because they were someplace they were not supposed to be and they broke the window out of a car. Apparently my son told the story at school one day and the police came knocking on my door. My son owned up to it and both boys told the same story as to how it all happened. The owner of the dealership said he would not press charges if I paid to replace the window. At first it sounded good to me. Then I started thinking.... What if it had been a younger weaker child, say about 9 or so that got locked inside that car in July or August, when the outside temp reaches 90+, on a Sun. when the dealership is closed, and  nobody knew he was there. The child would not have been found until sometime Monday and the outcome could have been much worse than a broken window. They may have found a childs body inside that car. If my son had not been able to break the window I would not have even dreamed of looking for him inside a car at the delaership. So my delima is... do I pay the $850 to replace the window my child broke or do I tell the dealership they are lucky he was able to break the window or they would be facing a negligence law suit for leaving the doors unlocked on the car? At the end of each day the sales people are supposed to "pull handles" to ensure each car is locked. I know this because I sold cars for a while. I want to do the right thing, and my son is grounded for 4 weeks due to this, but I also feel the dealership is also responsible.

He currently owes more debt (med bills) than the value of his liquid assets and the only main asset of value is his investment property. Since we want to keep it in the family, can i as the administrator purchase it myself and take out a mortgage enough to pay off his debts? I first thought to sell to my parents but they are also the beneficiaries so from that point I think there's an option to refinance/mortgage the real estate through probate. Is it a conflict of interest? I know it's my fiduciary duty first in handling of the estate but at the same token seems conflicting?

My Grandpa passed on the 15th October, he has savings and property which he said was left to me in his will. Suddenly a long lost nasty cousin has turned up out of the blue saying he is the executor dealing with Grandpas finances and that it has all gone to probate and that he did not leave a will. I believe the cousin stole grandpas keys to the house and car just before Grandpa died, as the car has gone!! and he is the only one with access to the house. The cousin said he has a meeting with the probate people??? and that I am not to attend, he has now changed his number so I can not contact him, I have no idea what to do now, I have called all the local solicitors who claim they have not got his will!! but this cousin knows a whol lot more than i do!!! any advise????? I have also registered with a missing wills website, who search for you. I have not advised the cousin of this!

20090129080108AAKYUEN	Politics & Government;Politics	Is our economy not true capitalism?	Capitalism is defined as a good idea rising to the top, bringing the one who thought it to the top with it.      Even if one ignores the fact that history- including American History- shows that when a good idea makes it to the top its usually because someone with more money and/or better connections stole it; passing this off as a lie designed to make the system work by causing people to be trusting enough to have their ideas more easily stolen for the betterment of the system:      It still wouldn't explain away the fact that those who create and/or profit from and/or perpetuate Ghettos and the third world break down the very structures which would allow these thoughts and ideas from rising to the top.      And furthermore that the people doing this realize this, and feel the money is instead coming from such oppressions; which by-in-large it is.      So usually the term is used it merely is used to justify what people high up in business would do anyway, and to discourage opposition of this, even if it seems to not be beneficial to the whole.      So why do so many people still think our money comes from Capitalism, or even that we are capitalistic; especially since We've never had a society not dependent upon slavery, weather Native American’s enslaved by Conquistadors, African American slaves, illegal immigrants (the decedents of the aforementioned Native American slaves, illegally [by modern international law] kicked out of this country) etc.

He attended public school until the 6th grade and was home schooled through 12th grade. He went to college for a few years, was a lab assistant there, but did not get his degree. He also went on a few mission trips, one of which was 6 weeks long. He was put in charge of his own site in a drug ridden ghetto and had people he was in charge of.

20090129075810AAFQ5Mz	Politics & Government;Politics	China denies usa allegations that china is cheating on currency front.what do u think?	Attack those you need most and attempt to imbue them with unearned guilt! We've seen this game before, Mr. Commie-Thug Dictator; or shall we call you Mr. Wen?      Chinese Premier Wen Jiaboa took to the Davos stage yesterday to attack the US and the West; it borders on comical. But sadly, the elite gathered at Davos are foolish enough to lap it up like the simpering capitalist dogs Mr. Wen believes they represent, and for the most part he is probably right.      It is too fresh that Mr. Wen attacks the system that has helped his country pull millions from poverty and allowed for the transition of the Commies to represent a new happy face to the world even though their underlying intention of complete control of everything they touch, no matter how they must cheat and steal to achieve this goal, has never changed.   This proves Chinese disrespect to world and west again.It proves enough china is only about violating human right and creating financial crisis in world.hat has changed is the degree to which the Western business elites have been duped into thinking this is a regime they can really do business with. Which goes to the rotting core of the leadership of our multinational companies and political elites in the West; again Mr. Wen exploits this well. Think of the big hedge fund investments of the former politicos who along with the first-tier Western multinationals who hold vast Chinese asset investments. It is very much in their interest to pretend dealing with China is free trade. Interesting this same crowd represents the major funding for "think" tanks that get so much press and ink in order to spout the mantra of "free trade." Lies flow from both sides - indeed.      If the dictator commie thug wasn't so busy making sure any real dissent in his own country was stifled and the proper threats to the state dealt with, maybe he and his gang would have provided more domestic choices for his own people with all their wealth gained from dealing with the system he now supposedly finds so repugnant.      My musing on a bit of Wen self-dialogue; it might go something like this:      Heck, if we create a real domestic market it might increase citizens' political power; we can't have that ... well, not yet.      We just don't quite have enough internet monitoring equipment and software from Cisco, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Google (and other assorted tier-one western companies) to control 100%--but those dupes keep upgrading our ability to electronically enslave our people, so soon we can create a domestic market with Chinese "character."      But since we are not there yet, let's continue to play the export model game that has enriched us so well. You know the game: invite all the Western companies in to produce in China. We make it a quid pro quo - in order to gain access to our vast consumer market we make those greedy dupes produce here and transfer technology to us. We treat them pretty good and gain access to hundreds of billions worth of technology funded by Western shareholders. And of course we outright steal the gold teeth from all the second- and third-tier manufacturers we invite into the country. Those clowns don't have well-funded think tanks to tell their story. No, instead those think tank dupes will continue to spout the mantra of "free trade" as we steal technology and jobs and hollow out Western manufacturing to boot. Gosh this is too easy. Wen's call for global action should be seen for what it is: China has milked the export model for years (granted low cost final goods have benefited to a degree, but recycling excess reserves is what created the asset bubbles and led Mr. Consumer to over indebtedness - it was not the other way around) and it is now crashing before their eyes; they've stolen Western technology for years to boost export prowess; they have suppressed their currency for years to make its final goods even cheaper in order to keep the export machine humming; and we all know China's enrichment was built on the backs of the blue collar workers in all industrialized nations. We have allowed for the hollowing out Western manufacturing so the power elites and the heads of our multinationals can enrich themselves through China.

20090129074127AAslW9b	Politics & Government;Elections	Is Obama's Stimulus Plan a eight hundred billion dollar MISTAKE?	Start with the tax side. The plan is to give a tax cut of $500 a year for two years to each employed person. That's not a good way to increase consumer spending. Experience shows that the money from such temporary, lump-sum tax cuts is largely saved or used to pay down debt. Only about 15 percent of last year's tax rebates led to additional spending.      The proposed business tax cuts are also likely to do little to increase business investment and employment. The extended loss "carrybacks" are primarily lump-sum payments to selected companies. The bonus depreciation plan would do little to raise capital spending in the current environment of weak demand because the tax benefits in the early years would be recaptured later.

Upon her return today to pick it up, she had noticed that the stone that was originally there was replaced by some worthless piece of glass that didnt even match in color with the one that was placed originally. Not only did the color didnt match but the size too. The back pieces that were holding the big zirconium stone were broken and the stone was practically dangling. It was completely obvious that the guy had replaced the stones. At the same time the repair guy was acting like nothing happened denying everything. Afterward my mom went to police to file a report but was told that there is no prove or evidence that the guy had replaced the stone and the only legal action that she could take towards that matter is take him to court. Even though the stone and the necklace arent of high price its of an extreme personal value to my mom. Please is there anything else we can do resolve this issue because it seems as though the legal system is never on your side when you need it. Please help. Thanks in advance.

20081015140252AAC954A	Politics & Government;Elections	Why would Joe Biden state: "It's Patriotic to pay high taxes"?	Hasn't he ever heard of the Boston Tea Party, The Stamp Act of 1765 and The Townshend Act of 1767? Lower taxes means more money for your family, for investments, for your 401k, for charity (by the way, I read where multimillionaire Joe Biden gave around $3,000 to charity last year), for college, and to improve your standard of living. Name someone else besides Joe Biden and the Liberal Democrats who enjoy paying high taxes?
20081014140154AAMpFzq	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do Democrats sneakily tax consumers, by saying they will tax corporations, who pass the tax on to you?	I don't get it. People always cheer the Liberal Democrats at rallies and speeches when they state that they will tax corporations more. The corporations simply pass the tax on to the consumer, so the audience is actually cheering because they are going to be charged more for shoes, or appliances, or ketchup. It boggles the mind. People (Democrats) love it when electric utilities are denied licenses to construct new power stations, and so they are happy that they will be paying higher rates when the utility buys power from another utility, and simply passes on the cost to the customer. Liberal Democrats always talk of "spreading the wealth around in this country" by taxing the wealthy people. Well, what if the wealthy corporations start to lay off people due to high taxes? What if the corporations decide to move their factories to Canada or Mexico in order to avoid the high taxes? That means one thing: more unemployment. It's better to have LOW corporate taxes, so low prices are passed on to the consumer as one company looks to gain market share (more customers) than another company by the only means possible: lower prices. Companies which pay lower taxes seek to expand their business, by hiring more workers. This is Economics 101, and for further proof, look back to the Reagan years. His administration inherited massive unemployment from the Liberal Democratic Carter administration, not to mention the highest prime rate - 21.5% - in the history of America, and double digit inflation. Low corporate taxes benefit everyone.

This is what I have found out so far.   Not one english soldier shot or dead.   Of the Irish 13 people lay dead and 17 wounded, one of whom died later.   John (Jackie) Duddy (17). Shot in the chest in the car park of Rossville flats. Four witnesses stated Duddy was unarmed and running away from the paratroopers when he was killed. Three of them saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran.    Patrick Joseph Doherty (31). Shot from behind while crawling to safety in the forecourt of Rossville flats. Doherty was the subject of a series of photographs, taken before and after he died by French journalist Gilles Peress. Despite the evidence of "Soldier F" that he fired at a man holding and firing a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs showed Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.    Bernard McGuigan (41). Shot in the back of the head when he went to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief at the soldiers to indicate his peaceful intentions.    Hugh Pious Gilmore (17). Shot in the chest as he ran from the paratroopers on Rossville Street. Widgery acknowledged that a photograph taken seconds after Gilmore was hit corroborated witness reports that he was unarmed, and that tests for gunshot residue were negative.    Kevin McElhinney (17). Shot from behind while crawling to safety at the front entrance of the Rossville Flats. Two witnesses stated McElhinney was unarmed.    Michael G. Kelly (17). Shot in the stomach while standing near the rubble barricade in front of Rossville Flats. Widgery accepted that Kelly was unarmed.    John Pius Young (17). Shot in the head while standing at the rubble barricade. Two witnesses stated Young was unarmed.    William Noel Nash (19). Shot in the chest near the barricade. Witnesses stated Nash was unarmed and going to the aid of another when killed. Widgery considered it likely that Nash was shot by a civilian firing at soldiers.    Michael M. McDaid (20). Shot in the face at the barricade as he was walking away from the paratroopers. The trajectory of the bullet indicated he was killed by soldiers positioned on the Derry Walls.    James Joseph Wray (22). Wounded then shot again at close range while lying on the ground. Witnesses who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal stated that Wray was calling out to say that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.    Gerald Donaghy (17). Shot in the stomach while running to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. Donaghy was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him. A later police photograph of Donaghy's corpse showed nail bombs in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced his death shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs. Donaghy had been a member of Fianna éireann, an IRA-linked Republican youth movement. Paddy Ward, who gave evidence at the Saville Inquiry, claimed that he had given two nail bombs to Donaghy several hours before he was shot dead [1].    Gerald (James) McKinney (34). Shot just after Gerald Donaghy. Witnesses stated that McKinney had been running behind Donaghy, and he stopped and held up his arms, shouting "Please don't shoot!", when he saw Donaghy fall. He was then shot in the chest.    William A. McKinney (27). Shot from behind as he attempted to aid Gerald McKinney (no relation). He had left cover to try to help the older man.    John Johnston (59). Shot on William Street 15 minutes before the rest of the shooting started. Johnson died of his wounds 4? months later, the only one not to die immediately or soon after being shot.   2 years ago    Rest in peace.    Any answers? No offensive language please! need to see all objective sides on this.

20081011220649AAHDqIE	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Really need to know if this would go on my record,?	so today i went to Kohl's with my mom and sister. I stole some earrings worth like $12 and wasn't thinking at the time (this was the first time and LAST time i would do this). As soon as we were walking out of the store two retail workers followed us out and asked for us to "come with them". We went back inside and into a backroom where one guy sat by i guess were the video surveillance and the other one asked me if i wanted to play games or be serious so in return i was like ummm and the whole time my mom was just really confused b/c i have not ever committed any crimes and have no record. The guy then asked me if i had anything that i wanted to give back, I took the earrings out from my purse and put them on the table. he took my mom out into the hallway and came back in he asked me to sit down while my mom questioned me why i did it and i told her i didn't know b/c i honestly don't know why i did it. The guy made me sign a paper and i didn't know my ss number and i told my mom and she replied with a "i don't know it either" the guy said "its ok" and told me i wasn't allowed in the store anymore. The police weren't involved but i'm really worried that this might go on my record b/c i'm soon to be applying for a job, im 17 and scared **** less, my mom cant even look me in the face shes so disappointed. Please if you have any answers or advice i would like to know thx
