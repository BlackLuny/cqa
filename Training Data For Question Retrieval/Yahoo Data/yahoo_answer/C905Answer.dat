2N6oTOLQaa	If you already paid the $50 to purchase the stock, then you don't owe anything. You simply loose your $20 if you choose to sell because you paid $50 and sold for $30. <br>  <br>  If you buy the original stock with $50 of borrowed money, then you will have to repay the full $50 you borrowed. The sale of the stock covers the first $30 you owe, but you have to pay the remaining $20 out of your pocket.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Because you did not specify that you paid, or did not pay the purchase price of $5, some are assuming you did, while others are assuming you did not.<br>  <br>  If you already paid the purchase price that is done.

When you add money to the account to purchase the $50 of stock, you own an asset worth $50.  When the value drops to $30, you simply own $30 instead of owning $50.

OCVFrgeXaa	Assuming you have no savings at the moment and therefore haven't used your ISA allowance, your best bet is to open a Cash ISA.  The interest rates on Cash ISAs tend to be better than ordinary savings accounts and it is tax-free (although you may not be a tax-payer at the moment any way, is irrelevant).<br>  <br>  The best accounts are internet based.  NatWests e-ISA was paying about the highest rate of 3.25% and you can set up a monthly standing order into it.  Just be aware that you can't pay more than ￡3,600 per tax year into a Cash ISA, although the balance can exceed this amount with interest of course, so if you pay in ￡3,600 and then take some money out, you won't be able to pay any more in until the next tax year.<br>  <br>  As an aside, ING Direct are paying 3% gross interest on their internet savings account.  For a limited period, if you open the account with as little as ￡1.00 they will pay ￡20.00 into the account within 28 days of opening.  No tie-ins or charges.

Uc7GM2Rnaa	Your question is aimed at those living on fixed incomes.  What happens when inflation kicks in because the Treasury is printing money beyond the Treasury's capability to get other people to lend us money?<br>  <br>  People living on fixed income might have still had investments that have eroded away.  <br>  <br>  But yes... I agree with you that the average poor person will be happy to see the rich losing their money.  They have been told that rich people are evil and that capitalism and profits are bad.  What they do not realize is that wealthy people do not sit in stuffy rooms with stacks of money laying around.  That money is used for investments, to start and expand businesses where people are employed.  Employed people make money to buy things.. you know silly stuff like food.<br>  <br>  We are led to believe by the current majority in Washington that trickle down economics doesn't work.  When indeed it does.  Have you ever seen a poor person hired by another poor person.  How did that work out?<br>  <br>  When you kill the rich and redistribute their wealth and realize that it came to very little you will see that it is not their money that you needed but their investment that you needed.  When you stifle through excessive taxation this investment, when you tell the wealthy that they are no longer welcome to the fruits of their investment through excessive capital gains tax, they will go elsewhere.  And you will feel good and warm in your poverty waiting for that government check in the mail so that you can go out and buy your loaf of bread and get a value meal at your favorite fast food chain... which will probably be closed, because the owner could no longer afford to stay in business and make a profit.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	I don't think anyone in their right mind would be glad that we are in a depression.

7HKTDcvYaa	If a nightclub were owned by a small group of investors and those investors decided to accept a new investor, in all likelihood the business is at risk of default that could take the business into bankruptcy. If it were not, it is doubtful the other investors would want equity capital from you.<br>  <br>  So, in all likelihood the money you bring in will go to pay down the debts of the business so that it can at least try to recover.<br>  <br>  If the business is flourishing and the group want to expand, then the money would go to pay for expansion.<br>  <br>  If one or more of the investors wants out, the money might be used to buy out the interest of that investor.<br>  <br>  If you have a lot of other assets, and this is a partnership, understand that all of your other assets may become part of the assets that can be seized by partnership creditors. So, in partnerships one is all in once one is a partner. You have to know the financial position of the partnership, but also that of each of the partners.  Accepting a partner can be part of a strategy to suck in all the other assets the new partner has.|`|qBCGH52haa	It usually goes into co-ownership.  For example, if the nightclub cost ￡50,000, theoretically speaking, the investors' ￡30,000 could get them 60% ownership in the club.  Or they could settle for being silent, behind the scenes partners for a 49% stake in the club.  It all depends on the finances, and other less tangible issues.|`|1rd0uf94aa	In many cases the investor brings nothing except the money. They are not necessarily involved in the Business in any way other than as an investor hoping for a return. In the corporate world a good example is Preferred stock. It has no voting rights and is simply an investment that seeks to make a return. In the case of a restaurant or a nightclub, many investors want some sort of benefit for their stake since it is such a high risk endeavor. Better than 95% of them fail to last 5 years, and even less show a return to the investor over 1%.|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Talk it over with the current owners.

23SkYEw5aa	read your contract.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure that there is a clause that you have to qualify for a mortgage.  However, the question is when? <br>  <br>  For example.  our new home contract clear states that once the buyer has provided the builder with loan approval (even with conditions from the lender), the financing contingency has been removed.  This means:  if buyers situation changes during the time that house is being built and the lender pulls the loan, they ARE IN DEFAULT and would lose their deposit and the builder has the right to sue for any additional damages.<br>  <br>  This may seem unfair.  However, the builder has NO CONTROL on the buyers finances.  And it is very easy to make a loan go bad.  Our contract puts the responsibility and RISK on the buyer, where it belongs.<br>  <br>  And to back up our contract, we ONLY TAKE 5% deposits - even if VA, etc.  We have very few kick outs - which helps maintain property values.

Keep in mind those people you know who are looking for work, and if you find a company that is hiring, forward information on to the workers. <br>  <br>  You can always write a personal letter of recommendation, based on what you know about their abilities and talents. Many of the companies hiring require an applicant to submit 3 letters of recommendation from co-workers or former employers. At the same time, companies are afraid to write letters of reference and will not release information. So, offering to be a reference for others is helpful (but do this discreetly so that if there is someone you are not comfortable doing this for, there won't be hard feelings).If you cannot write such a letter, offering to be a reference for them, is definitely appreciated.<br>  <br>  Finally, realize that these people will go through devaluation, anger, bitterness, financial difficulties, and a lot of stress. Many of these people will become rivals applying for the same positions. So, be sincere and supportive. <br>  <br>  But, as far as the lunchtime....let them know how much you have appreciated them and be sincere about it. Those words of kindness mean a lot.|`|v1iSZlRAaa	I work online at Cashcrate.  Recently we reached 1 million members!

4Jy8Hioiaa	Congratulations, now do not do anything. Take the money you would have spent on this months note and pay off some other debt like credit cards, student loans or something else. Save or invest it. Set up an emergency fund. Now that you have a little extra breathing room every month, make sure it counts for something. Just don't go blow it. You have made progress, keep moving forward. For a really great plan, pick up Dave Ramsey's book, the Total Money Makeover. Now that you do not have a car payment, you can do something really constructive with it. No time like the present to start setting yourself up for life. Nothing great was ever built without a set of plans. Get a plan. This has really helped my wife and I get our lives in order. We are now winning the battle. Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S. - we just paid off both of our cars almost a year early. We now take the $800/month we are saving and paying off our other outstanding debts.

DCixOqsnaa	Anytime that you do not meet the conditions of the original note it can effect your credit rating.  The lender would likely report this on her bureau as "settled for less than full balance" and the next lender would probably avoid doing a new mortgage for her like the plague.  A short sale of the home would have nothing to do with the lender unless they didnt get full payment, in which case it would be the same result as the above. Good luck!|`|rnfxNYx3aa	Of course i impacts YOUR credit.  Short sale goes on the credit too.

So if the bank had a gain then in the IRS mind someone had to h ave had a gain, therefore you had the gain.<br>  <br>  You should check with your tax consultant about any tax consideration about this potential gain.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Technically you still owe that amount.  You could be notified by your lender what your payment schedule will be, or they can forgive that amount. Or the lender can file a 1099 IRS form which grosses up your income by that amount for that year.   If you don't hear from them you can check with the county to see if they show your mortgage as "satisfied" if so, then you're off the hook. If not, then chances are they will try to recover that money from you somehow.   Depending on which bankruptcy you file, yes it can wipe that amount off, but you have to live with a bankruptcy on your record for 10 years.<br>  <br>  I can tell you from personal experience, that your creditors can make changes to your financial status with them due to a foreclosure.

However, if this is a theoretical question, I suppose technically you could look at the changes in inventory balances from one period to the next.

QoVL5cDHaa	Question A. Total income for year ￡23,800. <br>  Less personal tax allowance ￡6,035.00<br>  Tax at job on ￡8,965 at 20% = ￡1,793.00<br>  Bank interest ￡8,000 at 20% = ￡1,600.00<br>  Dividend income ￡1,800 at 10% + ￡180.00<br>  Total tax due ￡3,573.00<br>  <br>  Question B. Total income for year ￡41,400<br>  Less personal tax allowance ￡6,035.00<br>  Tax on job  ￡23,965 at 20% = ￡4,793.00<br>  Bank interest ￡9,600 at 20% = ￡1,920.00<br>  Dividend income ￡1,800 at 10% = ￡180.00 <br>  Total tax due ￡6,893.00<br>  <br>  I assume the figures of bank interest and dividend credit are gross. In both cases, in practice, tax would be deducted at source.<br>  Also, in practice, tax allowances are rounded up to the next 9, so allowance would be ￡6,039, and tax would be slightly (pennies) less.<br>  You are lucky that Daisy doesn't quite come into Higher Rate tax!|`|OsKDNKTEaa	Chatmast,<br>  You could do all this yourself by using the online tax calculators you can find through the search engines.<br>  Anyway in both cases there will have been tax deducted at the basic rate on both the bank interest and the dividends. these amounts will be shown on the statements and dividend statements.<br>  Daisy will only pay more tax if she moves into the higher tax bracket but this is not the case in either of your examples.<br>  Hope this helps but as I say, the answer should be in your hands already.

2ZahQeYZaa	Definitely call the police. They are invading your privacy and are taking unnecessary measures to stalk you. Also, they've tried to kill your animals which is another reason to alert the authorities. I would call the police as soon as possible to get them to stop.|`|C3LiKhm8aa	If what you say is true, you have a potentially dangerous situation on your hands.  If they have poisoned your dog and are responsible for hurting your animals, they are seriously dangerous.<br>  <br>  The best answer is to get the police and a lawyer involved and document everything that has gone on.  Keep a logbook or journal of everything that you suspect they are doing and make sure your lawyer has a copy.<br>  <br>  As far as what you can do to stop them, you can plant a fast-growing hedge between your houses.<br>  <br>  If possible, put finer mesh wire around the horse paddock or field to keep the dogs out.  If the neighbors put the dogs over the fence into the paddock, take pictures of what happens, call the police or animal control and have the dogs "arrested."  You can then have the authorities confront the people.  Since there will be a high fence that animals can't get through, you will have pretty good proof that the neighbors put the dogs over the fence.  It's a shame to have to bring the dogs into the action, because it's not the dogs' fault.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is you have a difficult situation on your hands.|`|ebFPNVZcaa	wow you have some wacky neighbors ! <br>  go talk to them and ask them why the hell they are peeping on you .. or you can always get the police involved or move if its that bad|`|rpN9fD20aa	Tell these people to get lives.<br>  There is no law restricting people from "peeping" from their own property.

AA10666701	If you cash it at the bank from which the check was issued they will give you all of the cash.

2N6oTOLQaa	You'll pay a 10% penalty, plus tax at your current tax rate. What is your current tax bracket? Add 10% and there's your number.<br>  <br>  Yes that's correct. If you're in the 15% bracket you'll pay 25% on the money you take out of the IRA. I agree its a big ouch, which is why most people recommend you don't touch your IRA. It would be better to pay a late fee on a bill or take a loan somewhere else rather than loosing 25% of your money to the IRS.<br>  <br>  So if you ask for 25% to be withheld, then you shouldn't owe any additional tax when you file.|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Correct. If you figure the tax right, your statement next year will include the taxes paid for that distribution, so you wont have to pay it again.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|AA10469473	If your tax bracket is 15%, you'd owe that plus the 10% penalty, so yes, 25%.

c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	I usually drive by the house first to make sure I like the neighborhood. If it is vacant I walk around it and look (and smell) in the windows. I look for general signs of upkeep by the previous owners. I also pay attention to the bottom of the house and look for water stains that may indicate rot or bugs may be present.<br>  <br>  Then I go to the web and find out more about the property and area. I check for registered sex offenders and how the schools are rated, even though I do not have kids yet.<br>  <br>  If I am still pretty interested then I call my agent. But you shouldn't go see every house the first time with the agent unless you are looking at million dollar homes. Sometimes a driveby is plenty. You don't want to get the agent frustrated with working with you and pressure you into buying a house you are unsure of.<br>  <br>  That being said, it is the agent's job to show you homes. I have seen a lot of homes with my agent. But there is no reason to spend the day going to different homes that you didn't even drive by. Location is a major factor. It wouldn't really be appropriate to expect the agent to spend hours and hours with you to look at homes that you decide are too far or too close to traffic, etc, that you could have easily noticed on your own. Agents do have other clients and lives and families.<br>  <br>  Going to open houses is fine. Go explore. But if you want to go into a particular house or go back to a house you saw when it was open, then bring your agent. I think it is best to see the house when the owners are not there if you want to make an offer. Would you feel comfortable checking under the kitchen sink for water damage and rot while the owners are there? Or can you talk honestly about your thoughts with the home owners there?<br>  <br>  Do not use different agents just to get some to show them to you. From what I understand it may be okay to have the agent who lists the house show it to you, but don't have two separate agents in the same area so they can both take you places.<br>  <br>  Ask your agent what he/she thinks. The agent may or may not be able to go with you to open houses. But they should be the one taking you to look inside any closed houses or in a gated community that you can't drive into alone.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I do not know what these "appointments" are that you are referring to.

But don’t try and see every single home on the market.  Check the areas out and find out which ones you prefer.  Then go to the features you like and then look at price and decide is it cheaper to go with a home that has the features you want or is it better to go with a home with a lower price tag. That you can upgrade on your own and save a couple dollars.

HjzwSTpJaa	Banks are required to hold a small percentage of their customers' deposits. This is called the "reserve requirement". They loan out the rest. Normally, it is not necessary to hold all the money because people generally only withdraw small amounts at a time.<br>  <br>  The system is called "fractional-reserve banking".<br>  <br>  The purpose of FDIC insurance is to avoid the situation where people withdraw all their money because they are afraid they will lose it. This is called a "bank run". Since the bank only holds a small percentage of deposits, there would be a huge problem if many people wanted to withdraw all their money.|`|AA10886262	are you kidding me????  they 'hold' no amount in their vault, it's all on paper, and I don't mean money paper......it's a shell game.....that is what has caused this meltdown; yes they should have had assets to cover the policy; they didn't and now they are all going bankrupt except for you and I are bailing them out.....they took the money in the form of payroll and bonuses and parties and benefits...the money they should have had to cover the insurance policies.....they used it...fraudulently...that is why we are in the mess we are in.

wb4LkCcYaa	It all depends on your credit rating. If you have good credit, you should consider Capital One Auto Finance who is known for their competitive auto loan rates. If you have fair credit, consider Roadloans. Also inquire with your bank or credit union since they may overlook some minor blemishes on your credit report. If you have poor credit, your options to get pre-approved prior to going into the dealership will be limited and you'll probably have to rely on the dealer's finance manager to get your approved through their in-house lenders.<br>  <br>  A site I've used...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://auto.lowratetoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://auto.lowratetoday.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	Typically, credit unions are a great place to shop for the best car loan rates. If your credit is shaky then you do not expect to get the best rate. A lot of times if you purchase a car at a dealership (new or used) they will broker it for you and find the best available rate. They usually give you a couple of days to find other financing so that gives you time to try and beat what they found for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Most people are a little creative on CV's/Job Applications and so long as you don't make extravagant claims about non-existent skills some 'creativeness' is tolerated.

Jobs are very hard to come by as you probably already know, find another job, and start as you mean to go on,look at what the job can do for you, and not what you do for the job. Did you find the job boring? Learn from everything that you do, and make sure the next time you do it better.
XvMPdzjUaa	Three things really help.<br>  <br>  Firstly, be professional. Make sure they know that your friends and history as a customer won't cause them any issues. Be smart, courteous and professional. You're going after the job because you believe you're the best fit, and it's something you want to do, not because of who you are. Dress well, don't even mention your relationship in the application or interview, unless asked. Just treat it like any other job interview.<br>  <br>  Secondly. Do your research. Make sure you know what the job entails, what your responsibilities will be, and why you want to do it. "I want to work with my friends" is not a good answer. Use a little bit of technical jargon, and show them that you are serious about the job as a job, not a place to hang out.<br>  <br>  And thirdly, don't take anything for granted. Just because you know some people who work there, and you've been a customer for ages, don't assume they know anything about you. General rule for interviews and applications is "If you don't tell them, they don't know". Don't assume you deserve an interview just because they know you, and if you don't get the job, don't stop going there. Other opportunities will come up, but if you burn your bridges, you'll never know.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Tell them that you will show up on-time and that you will work hard when you are at the center. That is all you can do.<br>  You could propose that you don't earn any money unless you get 5 recommendations from customers in the first 30 days. That would not sound desperate; but confident..
Pjm9pg7iaa	The best is to give no reason at all. "I can't come in to work today".  That is all. Then you don't have to remember "why" you didn't come in if someone asks you in 2 weeks or 2 months.|`|oiRYLv1jaa	Uh, here's the best excuse: <br>  <br>  "Boss, I really wanted to call off today, but I realize how much you need me here. I'm ready to work. What can I do for you first?" <br>  <br>  You must think your problem is your job. Sounds to me like you will carry the problem with you until you realize the world doesn't owe you a living. <br>  <br>  If you want a new job, do what I am doing and look for it on your days off and don't let it distract you from your paying job. You are lucky to be there every day they give you. <br>  <br>  MY SINCERE APOLOGIES if you are doing this for sociology research or anything like that!
XvMPdzjUaa	You have no choice but to tell them. It is the right thing to do. And ultimately regardless of what they tell you, you have to tell them that you've been offered this job. Not doing so  could be considered benefits fraud, and should they find out, they will claim back the money anyway, and it could potentially damage your ability to get a work permit in the USA.<br>  <br>  Either way, there will normally be some level of money you will receive. Most job seekers get some bonus paid to them for finding a job, additionally they will probably tell you that you'll be entitled to either JSA or income support for the interim period. Remember, you are still looking for a temporary job in the UK until you start your new job in the USA|`|ssGQsRJWaa	Keep Quiet, Wait Until the Last few Days before Leaving for your Job Then sign off, One of the Main reasons They pay JSA is your supposed to be Active in seeking Work, They will Stop your JSA and Probably mess you around Claiming Other Benefits.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Don't tell them as your money will stop, I have been offered a job starting on monday but I signed on tuesday and get my money on friday morning, I will go and sign off friday afternoon - it used to be that you got money until your first wage but now it stops instantly and you need to claim a crisis loan till you get a wage. Have you applied to immigrate to USA and have a visa and work permit as this can take several months before you get accepted, unless your head office is here and your tax and salary will be in the UK. When the Job centre ask what have you been doing to look for a job tell them you have been for interviews and it looks good and you are waiting to hear and ask them if you get the job in USA when do you sign off. Good luck.|`|AA11381848	You can tell them but they will expect you still look for a job in the UK. They will pay you until you sign off of dole officially. I wouldn't do that if I were you as they will stop all payments.<br>  <br>  Go in say you've accepted a job but you will be looking for another until you can start the one you have accepted as you can always turn the USA job down.

AA10137828	Be sure to use a real estate attorney. They will give you the correct procedures.<br>  <br>  Generally, the tax lien will have to be resolved before a clear warranty deed can be issued. Even if you are using a real estate agent, it is wise to have the attorney (yours not the agent's) do the title search.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	I presume you really mean you want to buy a house from a person who has a Notice of Federal Tax Lien filed against him and there WILL NOT be enough money coming out of the sale to pay it in full.  (If there is enough money to pay in full, the lien gets paid off and that's that.)<br>  <br>  For you as the buyer to receive clear title, the seller/taxpayer has to apply for a Certificate of Discharge of Federal Tax Lien to release the property from the lien.  He would have to pay IRS an amount that reflects the government's lien interest in the property.  This could be a lot or it could be zero.  That doesn't matter.  In today's market, there are are lot of sales where IRS gets nothing.<br>  <br>  There is an application process that requires jumping through several hoops to get approval.  It should be started as soon as escrow opens on the property because it takes about a month to get all the paperwork through and if IRS is not contacted until a few days before the sale is set to close the whole deal can fall apart.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	stop shouting.<br>  <br>  the normal closing process in America will handle this -- the closing agent simply deducts the IRS levy from the proceeds before paying anything to the seller.  The usual order of precedence applies, and the closing agent handles this.
bFRVSDteaa	When you are an employee, the employer pays half your Social Security taxes and you pay the other half.  When you are self-employed (an "independent contractor"), you need to pay BOTH halves.  The difference is 6.2% of your income up to $102,000 (for retirement benefits) plus 1.45% of all your income (for Medicare).  <br>  <br>  In addition, if you are self-employed, you must make sure you make quarterly payments for Federal and state income taxes as well as for Social Security taxes, in order to avoid the underpayment penalty when you fill out your tax return in April.<br>  <br>  So yes, you are wise not to trust your employer when they say it's better for you.  It's better for THEM, or they wouldn't do it.<br>  <br>  Legally, this is not a matter of choice for them (or for you).  There are some rather complex rules, but the IRS would say there is only one correct answer.  For details on who is an employee and who is an independent contractor, see the IRS article in the link below.|`|AA10469473	It means they are screwing you.  You'd have to pay more tax.  And they can't just decide to convert you - from your description you are an employee, not an independent contractor, so legally they still have to withhold taxes, pay employer taxes, and give you a W-2 and not a 1099.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	It means that unless the conditions of your employment are about change dramatically your employer is about to start cheating you.<br>  <br>  Some employers try to get around paying employment taxes (social security and unemployment) and other employee benefits like workers compensation insurance by improperly classifying employees as independent contractors. The basic issue is the amount of control the employer has over the worker.  If you are an independent contractor, the employer can dictate what the final product looks like but not how you get there to produce it. If you are required to show up for work--personally--at a particular time, punch the clock, use the employer’s equipment and are paid an hourly rate, or another set rate based on time served and jump when the employer says jump, you are an employee.  If you didn't understand the difference when you posed your question, I would be convinced that you are an employee. What is your preference, Slotted or Phillips?  Complete an IRS Form SS-8 to get an official ruling on your status.  This will help you get unemployment if you get fired. When you file your income tax return, you can attach Form 8919 Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages and only pay the employee's half of social security.  You will still have to cough up all the income tax. IRS and the states are stepping up enforcement in this abuse area.|`|ug00j0S8aa	You generally end up paying more in taxes since you will now pay both halves of Social Security and Medicare.  You also lose any fringe benefits, unemployment insurance, and workman's comp.  They are right that it can be better for you if they about double the rate of pay.  I did the calculations for my last job before I retired, and if I had worked independently my hourly rate would have had to increase by 75%-100% if I had done the same job as a consultant in order to get the same benefits after taxes.  It is also probably illegal for them to do this if your job isn't changing.|`|ARZIXzKjaa	It means you have to figure and deduct your own income taxes from your paycheck as well as self-employment taxes, i.e. social security.

fSlZQzS4aa	What is your question?  I would suspect that the statute of limitations for collection of the old taxes have expired by now.  If not, the usual rules for acceptance of an offer in compromise would apply.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	What's your question?<br>  <br>  Tax debts don't have a statute of limitations, they can chase you until you die and if you die before you pay they can take money out of your estate before your kids get to inherit it.

r330JQsXaa	That is how their 'Keep the Change' program works.  If you enroll in the program, they will take the transactions that you make, round them up to a whole dollar amount, and place that difference into your savings account.  For example, say you pay for something that comes to $11.75 with your debit card.  They will round that up to $12.00 and debit that against your checking account.  $11.75 will go to pay the merchant and $0.25 will be deposited to your savings account.  It is a kind of self-imposed savings program.  However, it is an optional program and if you ware not happy with them doing that, then tell them you don't wish to participate.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	It sounds like you don't understand how the accounts you opened work.

I wonder how we survived without Visa/McCard before 1966? I'll tell you, quite well.I'm 64.|`|5Af6j1qsaa	When you use your credit card, you're using the credit card's money to pay for your purchase.  You then owe that amount to the credit card company (as seen in your credit card statement).<br>  <br>  Usually a credit card company will not block purchases.  After all, they want you to make purchases and hold a balance so that they can make money off of the interest.  The only time they put a security hold on your account is when they are suspicious of the purchase.  For example, if you only buy gas once every two weeks, they might question the purchase if you start buying gas every couple of days.  Another example would be that you never purchase goods from fitness stores, and then suddenly you purchase $300 worth of goods from those stores over a course of several visits.  Yes, they do track you and try to determine your regular purchasing habits.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you were trying to purchase, but the credit card company felt that it wasn't something that you would normally purchase.  As for the rudeness of the customer service representative, either they had a bad day or perhaps you were getting on her nerve by being argumentative.<br>  <br>  I don't know if the attorney general can make the credit card money spend their money on you.  If you were stuck in a snow storm, however, I'm sure the credit card transactions would go through (and if not, just explain your situation to the credit card company and they'll surely unblock it).|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Very strange considering you pay in full each month.<br>  Have you checked your credit reports lately?<br>  annual credit report .com<br>  something might be wrong<br>  If you can add the card company name on here.<br>  use edit add details - im curious as can be.<br>  /

y4SUDnpaaa	You go to a mortgage lender and get precluded. If you're likely to be declined they can tell you why. It will be an inquiry on your credit report but it's common to shop around for a good interest rate  when you're getting a mortgage so the lender won't pay any attention. The loan with the lowest down payment and credit score is an FHA loan. At the present the down payment ranges from 3% to 5%. As of October 11, 2008 the minimum down payment will be 3.5% not a huge difference. The minimum credit score is 580    A portion of the closing costs can be rolled into the mortgage amount.

Some people get very angry and say things in formal notifications that they may regret later.  Your letter is straight to the point and you have thatnked them so that's nice.  All the best!|`|vBvgqjjsaa	The letter is good however you might want to apologize for the late notice. Most companies would prefer a 2 week notice when their employees are leaving.

And it will not effect you if you want to leave the country.<br>  <br>  What it does effect, is your credit for a while. I went through it about 11 years ago. You will have to wait at least about four years before you buy a house, and your interest rates will be high because of the <br>  bankruptcy, but that's about it. If you go through it, just watch your pennies in the future.  :-)
WuDXQGBgaa	what's on your w-4 at work doesn't matter how you file your tax return. your only choices are married joint or married separate.you can't file as single because you're married.your filing status goes by what you were on 12/31/2008. sorry!<br>  <br>  your employer isn't responsible for changing your filing status on your w-4 either,you would have had to file a new w-4 and give it to your human resources department yourself.<br>  <br>  BTW: most times it's best to file joint because you have a lower tax liabilty,only in small cases does it benefit a married couple to file married/separate.you all can run the numbers both ways by going to H&R BLOCK website and using the tax calculator on the top of the page to see which way is best for you all.<br>  <br>  married/joint you pay less taxes and may qualify for certain tax credits,but married/separate you pay more taxes and lose any credits you may qualify for.<br>  <br>  married/joint you and your spouse files taxes together(combining both your incomes)married/separate you and your spouse files individual tax returns as married/separate.|`|AA10469473	NO you can't file as single, since you are married.  You don't have to file a joint return though.  There is a filing status of married filing separately that you can use - you'll pay more in taxes total for the two of you, but you won't be responsible for each other's taxes.<br>  <br>  If you ask for an extension, you have to request it by 4/15.  And it won't change the odds of being audited.<br>  <br>  On a joint return you file one set of paperwork for the two of you showing all of your info.  On a separate return you'd each file a return, with just your own info.|`|5203612d842a45744262b29372d343b3aa	No you can only file as separate or joint (married). An extension has noting to do with your return being selected for an audit. (37 years as a tax accountant).<br>  You should file either a return or an extension by April 15th. If you owe tax it must be paid with the extension. The extension is only an extension of time to file not for time to pay. <br>  You should also figure out what your taxes would be since your husband is self-employed and does not have taxes withheld from a payc|`|N5pPJUS8aa	Okay, first up, it isn't your employer's responsibility to change your tax status when you get married.  It's up to you to change your W-4 with your employer.  This form, and what your employer has on file simply means how much they take out of your check each week in taxes, and has nothing to do with whether the government knows you are married.  The government knows, because your marriage was noted by your county clerk.<br>  <br>  You cannot file 'single'.  You have to file 'married filing separate'.  This is not a good idea, though.  You will be able to deduct much more if you file jointly.  The only time married filing separate is a good idea is when you are separated, or if your spouse is doing something illegal and you know about it.<br>  <br>  Next, you have to file something with the IRS, whether a return or an extention, by April 15th, or you will be assessed a fine, regardless on whether you have to pay or not.  Also, the IRS expects their money on April 15th, also, so you have to pay them what you THINK you might owe, and they'll pay it back when you eventually do your taxes.  Filing an extension doesn't mean you get more time to pay.  It only means you have more time to get your papers together.  And you WILL be assessed serious fines, interest, and penalties if you don't pay it by April 15th (I got hit with 21% app. interest).<br>  <br>  If your husband runs a business, there should be no question on whether he can afford an accountant or not.  You really should have someone prepare your taxes for you.  Business taxes can get very complicated, and if you try to do them yourself, you will regret it.

6LPeWXYuaa	There are a lot of missing details that make it impossible to give you the best answer.  <br>  <br>  First, what does your agent suggest?  <br>  <br>  Second, read your contract.  Is there a financing contingency that allows you to terminate and receive your earnest money if you do not qualify for the mortgage loan?  Can you still get the loan, but feel you will not be able to afford the house?  (Some lenders are way too generous with your money. :( )  <br>  <br>  If you have not told your lender about your current financial situation, you should do so immediately.  It may disqualify you for the loan you were to get.  If that is the case, you should be able to get a letter from the lender withdrawing the offer of financing.  That should serve as good cause for terminating the contract.<br>  <br>  Since you are willing to lose the $1,000, you are mentally in the right place.  How close are you to closing the sale?  Is it new construction from a builder, or a resale?  <br>  <br>  You probably can get out of the purchase, even if you lose your EM.  Read your contract, take it to a legal adviser if you don't know for sure what will happen.  Do it NOW.|`|b2d4WaZlaa	$ 1000 is not the issue as its evident from your Question. Repaying the loan is gonna be a long term issue and yes, you definitely will get out of this if you explain your financial position to the concerned auth.<br>  Signed Bonds/Agreements can be always altered if we don't have the capacity to carry on with it. Just talk to the people concerned ie the bankers or builders association head and get the necessary legal documents done up. <br>  Yes, you would have landed in thick soup had you taken this obligation and were unable to pay on time but this is not the case as of now with you. I assure that you are in safest hands as of now since you have NOT undertaken any obligation. Its just a kind of advance or booking cost that you have deposited. Infact, I am sure there are going to ways and means of getting this $ 1000 back. <br>  Just go for it and you will be there soon :) (Don't Worry)<br>  Everything will be okay|`|0jRsDtgmaa	Well, yes I believe you can get out of the agreement. <br>  As a last resort, work with your loan officer to have them write you a denial letter.  Have them state you are not eligble for such a large monthly debt. In the purchase and sales agreement it should state that you have roughly 30 days to get financed and if not, you do not get the house....another idea is to just stall the financial process and the seller will have no choice but to relist the property. Hope it helps.|`|TL2XoF5baa	Kiss the 1K goodbye.  They can try to sue you and force you to purchase and they very well may in this downturned economy where nothing is selling|`|ikXRqWxUaa	it would depend on your state as well as the purchase agreement that you signed.  you need to be asking this of your attorney as nobody on here will be privy to the info necessary to give you the proper course of action.  leave stuff like this to the pros...that is what you are paying him/her for.

A depression is when you lose your job. :)<br>  <br>  A good rule of thumb for determining the difference between a recession and a depression is to look at the changes in GNP. A depression is any economic downturn where real GDP declines by more than 10 percent.

YFrZD968aa	The Company hiring process is different for each employer. Some Companies have several steps to the hiring process. The fact that a person informed you they had received a request for a reference is a good sign, but not the "lock" that you have the job. If this is a Company you want to work for you should follow-up with a request of the status of your application after a "reasonable" period of time. Some Companies will notify the applicant they were not selected. Other Companies will only notify the people who they want to report for a second round of interviews or report to work. I hope this helps - I work for a plant that just shutdown and I am actively trying to help employees transition to other work. Stay focused. Unemployment is happening to several people, you are not alone....Check on retraining opportunities with state employment agencies, if you can't find work. Good Luck!|`|XvMPdzjUaa	Some employers only seek references once they have decided who they want to employ, some get references from all of the people they want to employ, plus a few extras in case some of the references come back negative. Others get references from everyone, and others still choose to request "random" references from across the pool of candidates so as to ensure that this sort of thing doesn't give anything away.<br>  <br>  The only way you could know would be if the reference has been requested from your current employer, and you ticked the "require no contact before accepting the position" box on the application form... in which case, congratulations. <br>  <br>  I would take it as a positive sign that you are still in the running, but honestly, the only way you will know for sure is once you get that call saying you've got the job.|`|AA10890466	no a sign of any thing accept that they are looking in to your background so i would not get my hopes up|`|WoRaXE73aa	Not really sure, and I am not sure why the person was not more specific with you.

AA11639059	Well, there was an item in today's news that the FDIC may become insolvent later this year, and there was news a day or two before that some international group did a survey and concluded that the safest banks in the world are in: Canada, Sweden, Luxemborg, Australia, and Denmark. If I were taking money out of the country, that would be my short list for places to park it. Something else, when you go shopping for banks, see if your account would be keeping your money in dollars or converting to the local currency. A drop in dollar value is greatest in a land where the local currency is rising. Then too this will change over time, so there are no guarantees. <br>  <br>  And as for taxes, you can safely bet that taxes will change and not for the better. If you earn money on your savings abroad, you still have to declare it, although you've already paid tax on the $20k initial stake, so it is just on the increase. Some countries don't tax foreigners and others don't tax their citizens when they live elsewhere in the world, but the US and Sweden and a few others expect their citizens to pay their home taxes whereever they go. Just because you park some money elsewhere, don't get fooled into thinking that the IRS is no longer interested in it, they are actually more interested in what happened with it.|`|5m5IR1eraa	The best place to invest & also get a very good return is Forex trading...

I can't wait that long for every stock to go up, but for long term investments, there's a wide variety of stocks that are down, and many will go down further yet. The Dow is probably going to go down somewhere between 6200 and 6700 before long. Yeah, we might have a rally before that happens, but that's not going to last and all stocks will come down again! We'll see more new lows, just like we did in October, then November and on through now. We just set some newer lows on Monday and Tuesday. I'd wait a bit if you're looking for long term or even shorter term (six months or less) rewards. I'm in some now, and I've owned Ford in November for a while but sold for a profit after a couple of weeks as I needed the money!<br>  <br>  I have snatched up some stocks, and energy stocks, solars, natural gas, utilities, materials, and the automakers are probably good bets, but I'd wait a while still to get into to hold on to for a profit!<br>  <br>  If I have the extra money, I'll be back in Ford again, Clean Energy (CLNE), some of the oil companies, the gold and silver mining companies, etc. Even Office Depot (ODP) and others will be good to get into one day soon enough again!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, that young lady above is correct, CVS, the pharmaceuticals and others are good bets as well!<br>  <br>  One more thing, don't listen to the people saying that the bottom is already in, because it isn't. The bottom didn't happen in November, it didn't happen on Monday or Tuesday and it isn't happening today! Two things to keep in mind: Other like myself have already said the market would go down further and it is. I know one guy that thinks it's going to go down to 4,100. I don't think it's going that low, but it could depending on a variety of circumstances. Some think it's going down to 3,000, others think 5,200. I think we'll definitely see 6200 to 6700 before long, and depending on all the data, it's probably going to go down further to at least 5400 to 5700. There have been so many people that said the bottom is already in on CNBC and elsewhere, but they've been wrong all along. Now they've been proven wrong again! Some keep on saying that! The bottom is coming soon, maybe here in March or April, perhaps as far off as August to November, but it could come as late a March or April of next year! So between now and next year, the bottom is coming upon the market and us and the economy! Obamas stimilus isn't going to do enough, it won't do it soon enough and businesses needed more tax credits than what they're getting, and homeowners need them as well! The Democrats and Republicans have not done enough! There should be more tax credits for home improvements, especially those involving energy reduction, solar, wind, geo-thermal, alternative energy, etc. I really don't want to even bother to think about all this mess, because it could have been avoided if Congress had acted sooner, and they could have, and Bush could have too. Even Clinton didn't do enough and now we're all paying, except for them. Obama isn't doing enough either, and again, neither is Congress!<br>  <br>  If I and others who have said the bottom isn't in yet say that the bottom is in, it most likely is!

CXviLoNsaa	Each home will have a bottom line price diffferent from any other home. The foreclosure process is expensive for the bank, and they will do a cost analysis in order to determine what is an acceptable offer. They do not want to hold on to any property, but they also won't give the home away...<br>  <br>  I'd be more than happy to help you determine a quality offer based on the particular home if you'd like.|`|ea2c09a93f92d7f85f71f746000cb318aa	Well once it is in foreclosure, the banks will go lower than the list price, you just make an offer and cross your fingers that it gets accepted.  There isn't a limit to the number of times you can make an offer, go for it, know what you are getting into though.  <br>  <br>  A lot of foreclosures nowadays have been completely stripped of plumbing, cabinetry, electrical outlets, so a lot of times it is basically walls and floors left.

ReByKdl4aa	Gaining a uni degree to be financially well off might be the conventional way of thinking for some people but it is by no means the case in reality. <br>  <br>  It depends more on what you study either at uni or college or some other training institutions, ie studyiing Accounting, Law, or Pharmacy at uni can earn quite a lot as can plumbing and brick laying, which are trades. I also know of business people who left school young and started from the bottom up to build a successful business as well. Being Personal Assistants (PAs) for big corporate companies can earn you qutie a lot as well if you build the experience and gain certified training. <br>  <br>  No offense to anyone studying English, Philosophy or the Arts at uni but these are not likely to lead to well paid jobs alone.|`|JICougt3aa	ofr course not being a uni graduate does by noooo means garantee a high income, it just doesnt happen like that!!!! xxx

You are more likely to spend money when you are outside.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	There are many ways to save money. The first and most practical is to live on less than you make. Stop going to restaurants, bars, movies, vacations, etc. That last on can kill any budget. Anything that is not absolutely necessary, cut out. Turn off lights. Dial down the thermostat and put on a sweater instead. Cut out extra cable channels. Go to basic cable or cut it out altogether. Bundle services like cable/phone/internet. Plan your trips around town. Meaning, plan where you need to go and do them in a loop. Go to 10 places in 1 "loop" trip instead of going to 10 different places in 10 individual trips. This will save you gas. Pay off and get rid of credit cards. Pay cash for everything. You don't need to be paying more for something than it is worth. Make sure you do a budget every month. I know that is the evil "B" word. You wil be absolutely amazed when you see where your money goes every month. Do it and stick to it. By doing a budget, you can tell your money where to go, not wonder where it went. You will have to have buy in from your family. You did not mention if you are married or have kids above. If so, they need to be on board with you. If you scrimp to save every penny and your kids or spouse are spending wildly, you'll get nowhere. Just a few quick ideas. Read Dave Ramsey's book called the Total Money Makeover. This is a great program my wife and I are on. It has really helped us get our priorities in line and saved us a ton of money each month. You can pick it up in any bookstore or at his website.<br>  Good luck. I wish you the best.|`|EQKaMfPAaa	Take a dollar our two and put it in a jar every day and any time you have spare change from buying something put it in the jar as well.  Once a month take it to the bank and deposit it.  If you treat yourself to Starbucks or something like that everyday, stop and put the money you would have spent there into the jar also.  You can also cut back on your utility bills by turning lights off and other things when you are not using them.  If you leave a room and are going to be gone for a while turn the TV off and turn the lights out.  Turn your computer, monitor and printer off when you are not using them.  When you go to work turn your AC or heater off. All these little things add up and by limiting their use you can lower your utility bill.  Clip coupons before shopping and buy store brands when available.  One trick I use is to analyze any purchase I make by asking is this something I NEED or is this something I WANT.  If it is just something I want I can do with out it and might be better off saving my money.  I still buy some of those want items, but I make sure I give it a lot of thought before I do it.  This way I am not being implosive. These are just a few of the things I do, good luck to you...

I see small pieces of plastic with a moulded hook in every DIY shop. I bought some that stick to the wall and I can hang things on them.<br>  For a Patent to be of any use your product has to be pretty special and unique. If a competitor can show that your idea is just a design variation of products already on the market then you will have little or no protection. there are people who specialise in breaking patents so that their clients can make a competing product.<br>  Have you checked out the potential market yet?

All you have to do is go to the US government .com website, and look for the button that says "patents". Go to this area, and type in whatever your product is. If there is  nothing else EXACTLY like it, download the form pages to file your patent, and send it in for the fee. I think it's currently between $35 and $50 dollars.<br>  <br>  Those places that say they will file your patent for thousands of dollars are a TOTAL rip off. I did this myself, so I'm not making it up. <br>  <br>  And if you manage to actually get a business to contract with you to use your invention, have a lawyer go over the contact for you, so you don't get scammed. The  guy who invented the video game TETRIS was paid $50,000 dollars for the patent, and it grossed millions and millions of dollars -- if HE had leased the rights to produce his invention, he would have ended up with way more than $50,000. He would have ended up a billionaire.

Therefore, your additional tax due at filing time as a result of these transactions will be whatever the difference is between the tax on your total income for the year, including the $12,000, and what the tax would have been on your other income (not including the $12,000).

bFRVSDteaa	In past years, NY state has often delayed paying tax refunds when cash was tight. This is nothing new. NY state will never admit it, but the consensus is that this is related to the end of the state's fiscal year. The NY state income tax refund flow tends to drop to a trickle in February and March, and then go back to normal after the new fiscal year starts on April 1. The larger your refund, the more likely they will delay payment.<br>  <br>  I hope it's different this year. I'm waiting for mine, too. Good luck!<br>  <br>  BTW, the best solution is to reduce your withholding or estimated tax payments next year so that you owe NY state a small amount in April, rather than making them an interest-free loan throughout the year.|`|fc8149bea45586b2106a782722a7097faa	i am  living in florida and i waiting too 8 week

They may go lower still, but it's impossible to time the market.  Rather than try to get THE best price, just be happy eventually that you got a very good price.<br>  <br>  You'll need to open a brokerage account, like at E*Trade or TDAnmeritrade.  They'll want you to send them a sizeable amouint of cash for starters, or an equivalent amount of securities if you have them.<br>  <br>  As for stocks, investing in food companies like Kraft would be safe for a possible lengthy Depression.  Look also at Blue Chip stocks that are badly underpriced like General Electric.  Or stocks that are low not because there's anything wrong with the company, but just because the economy is bad, stocks that will go up when the economy improves.  Like Alcoa or DuPont.|`|OKjBNCOzaa	You need to educate yourself before you buy anything. Read financial publications and compare what they say to what happens, As a novice I would start with a cheaper stock to take a bigger position in the company then a more expensive stock with a smaller position..<a href="http://www.investor-relations-firm.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.investor-relations-firm.com</a>|`|AA11639059	At a superficial glance, the prices for stocks tend to be amazingly low. In that respect it would appear that there are a boatload of bargains out there. Here is where the risk comes in, as in you could lose value, because we do not know how much lower the market will go.<br>  <br>  It is possible that the company you are interested in is bucking the trend. Some stocks are going up. The value of your company's work and situation, however, may change. The broad economy is in flux, so I trust you aren't going to 'bet the farm' on your chosen company.<br>  <br>  Here is an idea for you. The concept is called dollar cost averaging. If you apportion your money over a period of time, especially when values are falling, then you get to average down the cost of your investment. Suppose, for illustration, that on the first monday of the month, you put 10% of your money into XYZ, then next month you do the same, which may include additional money added to your investment funds. If the price of XYZ has fallen, you buy more shares. If XYZ has risen you buy fewer at the higher price. Carrying this on you have the potential for buying more shares when they are relatively cheap and fewer shares when they are relatively expensive.<br>  <br>  There are modified schemes for this. One is to set such a target investment amount over a period of time, but apply a reserve percentage. At the first purchase, you perhaps use 2/3s of your current period investment amount to buy the shares, and save the remaining 1/3. Next month (week, day, whatever) you see how much the stock has moved up or down since the starting month, then you add or subtract that percentage from the purchasing portion of that period's investment share. This way you buy increasingly more if the price falls, and a decreasing amount as the price rises. The saved amounts (1/3) in the example get pooled into the percentages and helps you maximize the buying of cheap shares and minimize the buying of expensive shares. When you go to sell, if you do, then you have an even lower cost basis than straight dollar-cost averaging.|`|CDqKAIEAaa	Betsy:<br>  <br>  To your last Q, I would say this is the worst time<br>  to be investing?<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  You do not know what you are doing, and you<br>  are looking to learn in what has to be one of the<br>  worst market declines in history.  <br>  <br>  I am going to past a lengthy answer I just gave<br>  to someone else because you may find it<br>  appropriate to your own circumstances.<br>  <br>  This is just my opinion, but it stems from facts,<br>  and facts are what you need right now. You have<br>  time on your side, so do not be in a hurry to<br>  start unless, and until you have a much better<br>  grasp of what you are doing.<br>  <br>  Consider: After the stock market crash in 1929,<br>  it took four years for the market to bottom. The<br>  current "Bear" market is barely a year old. Does<br>  it make sense to be in such a hurry, given history,<br>  when there could be AT LEAST 3 more years of<br>  decline.<br>  <br>  The severity of the market drop this time around<br>  is unprecedented. It could get real ugly before<br>  this is over.<br>  <br>  To your very intelligent question, how to find <br>  good/trustworthy people? At the end, you ask<br>  for help. Who could you trust more to help you<br>  out, and who has more of a vested interest in<br>  your financial well-being than YOU!<br>  <br>  Start there. Start by acquiring some knowledge<br>  about what is entailed in making investments.<br>  An excellent, and inexpensive start would be<br>  to buy William O'Neil's book, "How To Make<br>  Money In Stocks."<br>  <br>  This will give you an appreciation for learning<br>  out to make the best possible selections in<br>  the markets. You will learn to look for the<br>  strongest stock potentials that are already<br>  proving an ability to appreciate in value,<br>  <br>  You will learn that "bottom-picking" is a<br>  fool's game and a quick way to waste money.<br>  <br>  O'Neil's company publishes "Investors Business<br>  Daily." Your local library may have copies<br>  available for you to read. In section 2, the market<br>  is broken down into sectors, starting with the<br>  strongest, and within each sector, you will find<br>  a ranking of each stock, again, starting with the<br>  strongest.<br>  <br>  When you invest, you want to invest in stocks<br>  that are proving themselves worth the risk. This<br>  will teach you how to identify them, and how you<br>  can make your own informed decisions.<br>  <br>  There is more, but this should be a good start.<br>  <br>  Do well for yourself. It is not about surrounding<br>  conditions, it is all about the decisions you<br>  make.<br>  <br>  To some of your specific Qs, you purchase<br>  stock by opening an account, those are simple<br>  mechanics.  What to buy, and when, are not.<br>  <br>  Yes, if a stock is listed at 90, it meand you will<br>  pay 90/share, plus commission, costs.<br>  <br>  Let me also dispell a previous answer about<br>  "dollar cost averaging."  It means to keep<br>  buying something that is declining in value<br>  in order to lower you average cost.  That is a<br>  myth.  When anyone dollar cost averages, <br>  they are increasing their losses and risk<br>  exposure, at the same time.<br>  <br>  Given a choice, would you rather buy something<br>  that is going up, or something that is decling in<br>  value?<br>  <br>  If the thought crosses your mind that you may be<br>  getting a better deal by buying at a lower price,<br>  you may soon discover that a "lower price" can<br>  easily become LOWER.<br>  <br>  That is addresses in the book I mentioned.<br>  <br>  You are asking excellent Qs, Betsy.  Get the<br>  answers before proceding, and never stop<br>  asking questions until you get an answer.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|5m5IR1eraa	Thats good you looking to invest in stocks.<br>  <br>  Also i would recommend you to try out Forex Trading similar like Stocks but with a better fortune:-)<br>  <br>  Check out this site got a great help from it:-D

XvMPdzjUaa	If it has been processed, that means that they have received it and looked over it, to decide whether to interview or not. Some employers call it Processing, others a paper sift, but it all means the same thing, It is taking the maybe 500 applications they received, and narrowing it down to maybe 20 to interview. Sadly, with a lot of big employers the rate of attrition is pretty massive. All of those people will be told the same thing, their application has been processed. The fact that the job has been removed from the site simply means they don't want any more applications, not that it has been filled. <br>  <br>  Most application forms include a cut off date, and prospective interview date, normally about two weeks after the cut off date, but it varies.

Am I to assume that i've not got an interview this time, and if so could I have some feedback on my application form for the future" <br>  <br>  It gives them a chance to let you down easily, or let you know what's happened, and hopefully, if you've not got an interview will give you an idea where you went wrong.|`|R8VBZxD4aa	Go in person, talk to the person in charge.

The only factors involved is the balance owed ($141,000), the interest rate (6.5%?) and the payment you are making per month (double the $1,100 or $2,200 total per month) to pay off the current balance.|`|0rpS2b97aa	When I bought my house.

You need to specify to apply to principal.|`|17RmbitOaa	Depends on the time you mortgaged your house for.  If you had a 15 year mortgage, you would cut at least 7  years off your payments.  You do have to arrange with the lender that any monies added to the payment go directly against the principal.  Look at your present payment stub.  It should tell you what amount goes towards the principal, and what goes against interest. Each $ you pay off towards the principal is money going back into your pocket, and not the lenders.|`|Ja9DNpC6aa	Absolutely, just as long as you don't have any pre-payment penalties with your lender for paying double the amount (or overpaying).  You can cut your total mortgage term down by 5 to 10 years depending on what the original balance on your mortgage was.

I'm not sure what this translates to monthly or hourly.  But, check out the current Nursing and Midwifery Multi-Employer Collective Agreement (MECA) at the first link below - the full range of salaries are listed in the MECA.  The second link is to information for overseas nurses and midwives wanting to work in New Zealand.

In most hospitals the shifts are 11pm-7am, 7am-3pm and 3pm-11pm.  <br>  <br>  So 7am, 3pm and 11pm are the changeover times when they discuss issues that have arisen with the patients in their care<br>  <br>  Not really sure how many days a nurse works - I would estimate 4 or 5 shifts in a week which would equate to a 40 hour working week.  Most nurses also switch between the morning, afternoon and evening shifts to keep things fair.

They said that even some of the most popular tax software programs had mistakes early on (most have been updated and corrected for people who actually download their software updates). <br>  <br>  As a result of all the confusion, the IRS is double checking every tax return this year to make sure the RRC is correct. There is no penalty if you made a mistake, they will simply correct it for you. If you claimed more than you're allowed on the RRC, it means you'll get a smaller refund than you were expecting. If you forgot to claim it they will add the amount to your refund. <br>  <br>  If your refund changes by an exact multiple of $300 (like $300, $600, $900, $1200 etc) this is a good indication that it might have been an error on the RRC.|`|AA10469473	If something about your return is questioned, the IRS might send the part of your refund not affected by what they are questioning and hold the rest until the issue is resolved.  If that happens though they send you a letter explaining what's happening.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Most people mistakenly treat income tax time as winning the lottery (at least one of the cheap daily games).  They count on a big refund, plan on it, even spend in advance of it, only to find out there was a mistake.  You really shouldn't work it into your budget.  Treat it like found money when you actually get the refund.  <br>  <br>  By design you really should only be getting a little or giving a little.  If it's a matter of hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars, there's something wrong with your withholding figures.

Aside from the minor problems,  aluminum wiring is a biggie and very expensive to fix, as the entire house must be rewired.  I think that's more of an issue than foundations repair and should be at least as much as $8K.  Repairing cracks is not a satisfactory solution when there are that many.... as so many foundation faults indicate a general problem with the site and basic construction of the house.  Tell the owner, that   because of the multitude of structural and code compliance problems, that you will insist that he personally warrant the foundation and wiring for a period, of say 10 years  and post a bond to that effect,  perhaps for $50,000.   -  that should intimidate him enough to get back your $500.    A simple verbal request first... if the money isn't returned within a day or two,  then you could get your lawyer to write a simple note, or better yet,  go to small claims for the cash, plus your other expenses, such as inspection, time, travel, etc. etc.... looks like an easy win to me.

cc771ae38bd5ed69cd69113006774f1eaa	There are two ways to increase traffic to your site:<br>  <br>  1. Pay-per-click<br>  <br>  This type of advertising allows you to set up an account and buy clicks by setting up a maximum amount you are willing to pay-per-click. An example of this would be using Google adwords or Yahoo search marketing. <br>  <br>  Once you purchase clicks, you set your account up to appear when certain keywords are searched for. The ad will appear at the top or along the side of the search results, where it says "sponsored results." Each time someone clicks on your ad, it will cost you.<br>  <br>  2. Increasing Your Organic Search Engine Placement<br>  <br>  This refers to where your site places within the search engine results for keywords that relate to your business. There are several ways to increase your site's placement but I am only going to review the most important ones.<br>  <br>  - The overall design of your website will impact the placement it receives within search engines. Web sites that are mostly flash or graphics and that contain very little text will not good placement because search engines cannot index this content. Sites with bad code also cannot be indexed.<br>  <br>  - The content of your website should be interesting and original. It should contain the keywords that you want individuals to search for within search engines but not so many times it seems overused while being read by a human.<br>  <br>  - Ones of the most important things that google bases their placements on is linkbacks. This means they check to see how many sites link back to your site. The sites that link back should be sites that are good quality and relevent to your site content and industry. Not only does this serve to get you good placement within search engines - you will be surprised to find when you analyze your web stats how many hits you get from these links.<br>  <br>  On a side note, it's important to remember that SEO isn't everything because not all search terms are equal. If you don't know how to figure out what search terms to target (based on how many people are searching per month for those terms) then a lot of this information might not get you any results.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in hiring a professional who will review your site's code, research search terms for you, increase your site's content, and report SEO results contact me at 1-866-374-4198.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blueringdesign.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueringdesign.com</a>|`|3mAgM405aa	The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kLXgrjISaa	What is your website?

Sozc3MyFaa	This is a hard career in the best of times.  Your best bet is to try & get a job with one of the big architectural firms.  They would at least pay salary & benefits. This would probably involve moving however.  Sometimes that can not be helped to further careers.  Do you have a portfolio?  Start making one now.  Then start a list of large firms (HOK, Gensler, etc) and start applying.  ANother option is to work for one of the manufacturing houses/fabricators/textiles such as hermann miller. Contractors also need CAD, but aren't building much right now. A third option is going to work for a showroom that has on-site decorators & designers (the furniture places like Ethan Allen, kitchen remodel showrooms etc)You should also contact your school & see if they have suggestions. You may have to put your plans on hold until the economy rebounds somewhat as well, particularly if you can't move.  You should start a tight budget & try & save money so you can move as well, as many of these places are in large cities.
qBCGH52haa	As close as you can come would be Zillow.com - market value depends on more than just the home, it also depends on what comparable homes are selling for in the area, demand, etc. Zillow provides a rough market value, but the only real true way to gauge your house's worth is to get 2 or 3 assessments from real estate agents who know the market and can compare the house against recent sales and listings.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	In addition to Zillow, there's RealEstateABC. Also, Bank of America has a home value estimator on its site.<br>  <br>  However, as a previous answer noted, your best bet is to have a Realtor do a CMA (competitive market analysis) on your house.<br>  <br>  A CMA can be done without a walk-through. What the agent will do is look at recent sales (within the past 180 days) in your geographic area with homes having similar characteristics as yours (same approximate age, number of bedrooms, number of baths, etc.). That's what I'd suggest.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
7HKTDcvYaa	Other countries are in distress too. Other currencies fall not because the US is strong, but because they are perceived as week.<br>  <br>  Canada's Loonie has been losing ground against the US dollar because we are expecting difficulty in selling our largest exports, Oil, and auto parts. A country's currency often reflects the effort to continue selling despite economic difficulties. One lowers the currency to, in effect give a discount on all of your exports, and to charge an extra cost for imports.  It is subtle protectionism.<br>  <br>  Should the effort fail, it will likely fail because so much money goes abroad to buy foreign goods. If that should be why it fails, then the USA will invoke that subtle protectionism, devalue its own currency to sell more and buy less.|`|uBtWPy7Gaa	In my view, the fact that the US acted quicker and more decisivley than other countries is causing the strength in the pound. They will probably be the first country to see the light at the end of the tunnel.<br>  <br>  Also, its seen as safe haven curreny in times of economic trouble, and of course oil is priced in dollars which helps.  I dont thinnk the dollar get much stronger, but as other currencies weaken you may still see rates increase.

NrvrH4zQaa	In my experience, most preferred don't have a maturity date (or if they do it's so far out in the future that it's immaterial).  They do have call dates, a date when the company can buy back the preferred at $25.  However, if the preferred is trading at $10 it won't be called.  Sometimes a preferred will be called if a new issue is going out at a lower rate, for example, an 8?% preferred will be called at $25 and a new preferred at 7?% will be issued at $25.  That 1% can save the company a bunch of money.

AA10925828	You need to have a plan in place at least 5 years before the person goes into the nursing home.  Any transfer of assets that occurs within 5 years of the person entering a nursing home will require the person to pay an amount equal to the asset value before medicaid or medicare will pay for the nursing home.  In other words, Let's say you give away $100,000 worth of assets 2 years before entering the nursing home, and the nursing home costs $5,000 a month.  Before the government will pay for the nursing home care, the person will have to pay $100,000/$5,000, or 20 months of the nursing home stay (plus whatever the current value of their assets is when they enter).  If the person doesn't have that money to pay, they won't be in the nursing home with the government paying.  The family will have to provide care until 5 years after the transfer of assets.<br>  <br>  Nursing homes are expensive, and can easily run over $5,000 a month.  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to consult with an elder care attorney.  Those attorneys specialize in structuring estates for the elderly, but like I said above, it has to be put in place 5 years before the nursing home is needed.<br>  <br>  Now, my next thought about protecting the money from the nursing home, is that there is a big difference between nursing homes.  Those that accept medicaid patients mainly probably don't have all the amenities that a facility that is mainly private pay would have.  Wouldn't you rather have mother or father in a nice place, rather than one that isn't as good?  Shouldn't mother or father's assets be used to put them in a nice place so that they can live their final years in comfort, rather than in someplace that is adequate but not as nice?

But be aware that many experienced eBay bidders will wait til the last one minute of the auction to place their bids.  This is referred to as "sniping." They place their bid as close to the end of the auction as possible, hoping that no one else has time to outbid them.  (Some auctions are also set up with a "Buy It Now" option - if you take that option, the auction ends immediately and you win.)|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	jz is correct.  in a nutshell, highest bid wins.<br>  <br>  Take the tutorial here for details:<br>  <a href="http://www.ebayuniversity.com/gotraining/First_Time_Bidding_And_Buying" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebayuniversity.com/gotraining...</a>|`|5bb9fc43e31877bc5eeb2ce0484be92baa	You submit your bid, when the time remaining for the auction runs out the person with the highest bid wins.

Go out during the day to places like the Salvos and other thrift shops and buy things cheaply that you can resell on Ebay. I would suggest you stick to jewelry, china or upmarket clothing or even kids clothes that are practically unworn or new with tags. Go and research on ebay what sells and what doesn't and how to go about selling things. You will need a digital camera and probably a scanner to start with but these aren't too expensive. Just buy a few things at first and see how you go. Keep whatever money you make and use it to buy more things and before you know it you will be doing it full time. You must be honest and fair dealing with people or you wont last long so be careful and get the stuff sent asap after you recieve payment.|`|awPExkwfaa	Hello.<br>  <br>  My suggestion for home business comes down to what i did!<br>  I've been searching the internet for a plain, simple, easy way to start it all up, and suddenly the opportunity came to me. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boostyourwallet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.boostyourwallet.com</a> was really a great help for my success and i've never experienced any troubles what so ever.<br>  <br>  The site offers you video guides, fulfilled text guides and everything you could possible imagine in a very easy way to understand.<br>  <br>  Take a look for yourself, i believe i found my best shot at the whole internet money making thing!<br>  <br>  Do your success as i did mine, good luck.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Jesper.

Guess what? Now you receive nothing and your appeal will also be denied, thats what happens when you want something for nothing|`|vigFmfLmaa	So basically you're upset because you quit a job to live off unemployment and that backfired on you?  I think the moral of the story is that you should work for your money, not try to find a more 'logical' way to receive money without working.  I don't know how to answer your question because you were going to collect UI benefits; you just mucked that up.
nmozvlGPaa	Yes, you likely make too much money to get a bank to agree to a short sale.  The lender currently won't even speak with you because you are current and can afford the payments. They would look at you with a sense of astonishment that you are trying to get out of your agreement. <br>  <br>  I can't really say that I'd blame them, either. You agreed to purchase a property for a certain dollar amount. You agreed to repay that money when you signed your loan documents. You didn't agree to pay if and only if the property stayed at the current value or increased, did you? No, you agreed to pay. If you could sell for $100,000 more than you bought it for, would you give the bank that loaned you money an extra $50,000 when you sold? You wouldn't? Why are you asking them to take a $100,000 loss?  They were your funding source, not your investment partner.  <br>  <br>  Deliberately increasing your debt-to-income ratio to get a bank to agree to a short sale won't work.  They will see that you took on this debt recently and then choose not to work with you.  You do realize that a short sale is a loss mitigation technique for a bank, right?  They don't want to do ANY short sales, but if it really looks like the property will go to a full foreclosure, they can LOSE LESS by doing a short sale.  The banks are so weak right now that they can't just let every schmuck who owes more than they could sell their house for to do a short sale.  <br>  <br>  In a short sale the difference is often forgiven. Many times you have to pay taxes on that money like it was income. <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  edit - RUSH *IS* A BAND!!  <br>  <br>  You have to admit upon reading your question that buying a car so that your debt to income goes awry so that you qualify for a short sale might make you seem like a schmuck.  I can't believe the number of Y! Answers people who essentially ask that question - can I walk away just because I owe too much money?  I am obviously sick of that question and people trying to weasel out of what they owe.  <br>  <br>  Different banks use a different number for a DTI limit (debt-to-income) for qualification for a short sale, but I'd suspect that many of them are over 50% (and you can see why these loans are/were unaffordable).  <br>  <br>  The time to have asked for the forebearance was when you were unemployed.  Now that you have income again, they are going to be much less likely to work with you.  Maybe you can convince them to defer a payment or two until the end of your mortgage to help you catch up.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Call the bank and find out.  The worth is not now unless you sell now.  Things will pick back up and your value will go up.|`|6LPeWXYuaa	Congratulations on getting another job and your ability to cover your living costs.  Many people are not so lucky.<br>  <br>  As noted by another poster, although your situation is lamentable, it is not dire.  The lender's incentive to do a short sale is to cut their losses, not yours.  So far, they have no losses since you have been able to maintain your account current.<br>  <br>  You have to write a letter outlining your need as well as show that you have no resources to pay your obligations and won't for the foreseeable future.  <br>  <br>  The lender will only agree to a short sale if it is in THEIR best interest, since they can always take over your property as a foreclosure.<br>  <br>  Even if the lender agreed to consider a short sale, you must bring the lender offers that they will have to agree to or they will not release the lien so that clear title can be given to the buyer, so you may not be able to realize a short sale in any event.<br>  <br>  A short sale transaction is an exercise in frustration for all involved.  I don't recommend you even go down this road.  A short sale is at the discretion of the lender, and it doesn't appear that your situation will warrant the lender's approval for a short sale.<br>  <br>  You tried to do the responsible thing and took on debt to stay current with your obligations.  I applaud you for that.  These are very tough times for many and there doesn't appear to be any easy way out.  Staying afloat today is about the best many of us can hope for.  Getting ahead, well, that's what we live for.  :)<br>  <br>  If your other debt is a problem, you may try to get relief using a credit counseling bureau which can help you consolidate the debt, freeze the interest accruing and help you pay it off in a timely fashion. It will, of course, affect your ability to use credit until you have paid off your cc debt.<br>    <br>  Realize that this is your home, not just an investment.  I suggest you get involved with your HOA and make sure that any increases in condo fees are justified.  Go in and protest the tax appraisal value of your home to lower the property taxes.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
bFRVSDteaa	In past years, NY state has often delayed paying tax refunds when cash was tight. This is nothing new. NY state will never admit it, but the consensus is that this is related to the end of the state's fiscal year. The NY state income tax refund flow tends to drop to a trickle in February and March, and then go back to normal after the new fiscal year starts on April 1. The larger your refund, the more likely they will delay payment.<br>  <br>  I hope it's different this year. I'm waiting for mine, too. Good luck!<br>  <br>  BTW, the best solution is to reduce your withholding or estimated tax payments next year so that you owe NY state a small amount in April, rather than making them an interest-free loan throughout the year.|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	NYS is notorious for slow-pay on tax refunds.

Any jointly-held accounts can be attached by creditors of only one of the parties on the accounts. <br>  <br>   A much better way to handle this is to give your children signing privileges on your checking account (if the bank will do this) or appoint them powers of attorney for finance.

AA10526402	I am in a nice suburb of Buffalo, NY.  My home is 1904 sq ft, built in 1987, 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths...I paid $190k one year ago.  Maybe you should move to Western New York...it's not that far! :-)|`|AA11211495	Well, years ago I bought my first house in FL.  It was a 1327 sf  3 bedroom, 1.5 bath on a fenced corner lot with mature fruit trees and a water view.  I paid $58,500 for that house.  I put in new flooring and painted the walls.  That was it other than routine maintenance.  Last I knew that house was on the market for $175,000 with no interest at all.<br>  <br>  When I sold that house I moved to SC and bought a 1568 sf 3 bedroom, 1 bath on just over a 1/4 acre fenced with a huge detached garage.  I paid $35,000.  I put in new flooring, added a bathroom, and replaced the kitchen cabinets.  I did all of the work myself and the cost to update that house was just under$10,000.<br>  <br>  The house I just bought a couple of months ago in Indiana is an 1800 sf 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom on a fenced corner lot with a fireplace, oak floors, detached carport, garage, and small in law suite.  I paid $20,000.  This house needs a little more work than my other houses, but it also has a lot more charm.  I have had new plumbing run to the full bath and kitchen (cost just under $1,000) and have spent much time cleaning and painting.<br>  <br>  I will caution you that often times when you see really low prices for homes it is not so much that the house needs a lot of work, but that there are no jobs nearby.

In Louisiana homes range form 60.00 per sq. ft. for poor neighborhoods to 150.00 in the better neighborhoods. As the real estate market continues to fall it is the best buyers market in my lifetime 57yrs. If you have children you will find that homes in the better school districts are considerably higher. The market here in Shreveport LA, is unstable and the economy is good. Some neighborhoods here with small houses are so sought after that they bring a better price. This is a suggestion: if you find the home you want get a Home Inspector with a reputation for writing detailed reports. Realtors usually will not refer to these. But a Home Inspection that is not satisfactory is one of four ways to gain a release of contract. This is important because you can now be sued for the cost of the contract if you try to get out of it without due cause. Most importantly is a Home Inspection lets you know what you are buying, get things fixed, or to negotiate a lower price. What I mean by that is a home is not worth the asking price if it requires costly repairs.

While I would not deny that such occurs on occasion, such occasions are extremely rare, and generally result in something 'slipping through the cracks' somewhere.<br>  <br>  Of course, you CAN buy a "$300K" house for half of what it is supposedly worth, but be prepared to spend the other $150K bringing the property back to what it is actually worth on the market.<br>  <br>  The 'cup of free coffee' is still elusive and rare.
95d83b419e75c80fac873221a64106daaa	CEO Salaries:<br>  Capital One $73 million, JP Morgan Chase $20 million, B of A $20 million, Target $13 million, Mastercard $13 million, Wells Fargo 12 million<br>  It won't stop. These are creative tactics to make more to support their infrastructure. They also change due dates, it's a common, but dirty practice. It causes late & over the limit fees. CEO's shouldn't make any more than 12x the average worker in the company. But this scenario doesn't paint that picture.|`|Y5j2Cr14aa	I gave up my credit cards years ago.|`|AA11447210	Yup...my 2 Capitol One cards raise my interest rate a month or so ago. I always pay my balance in full, have never been late, gone over my limit, etc. <br>  <br>  All they did was cause me to want to use those 2 cards less. So far I don't think my Discover has made any changes (that I've noticed) and it's my fave anyway.<br>  <br>  The cards are a convenience for me. I put all my monthly expenses on one (or more) then pay them off in full when the bill comes in. None of the changes listed above would affect that for me, but for those who carry a balance, it does make it more expensive or less convenient to do so.
mwkfirjRaa	Oh, yes.  And he lives right next door to the welfare mom who drives a new Cadillac.  The one who spends all her food stamps on cigarettes and beer.<br>  <br>  Give me a break.  This stuff is made up.  Show me one example of your poster child for credit excess and I'll give you hundreds of examples of everyday, hard-working Americans who got robbed blind of their homes that often were paid for.<br>  <br>  This credit crisis occurred because 1.)  banks collected huge fees for originating loans they then sold to investors on the secondary market; 2.) no one was paying any attention to the rampant fraud that occurred in the underwriting of these loans; 3.) the rating companies gave AAA ratings to the securities that were backed by the mortgages; 4.) predatory lending practices went unchecked; 5.) speculators could invest in and flip homes with absolutely no money of their own on the line, driving up the cost of real estate beyond affordability; and, 6.) some borrowers resorted to creative financing because home prices increased so far ahead of wages that many people could never hope to own a home in their lifetimes. <br>  <br>  I've been a banker most of my life and I attended the seminars in which the predatory lending practices were taught without any regard to ethical or economic consequences.  The average consumer and/or taxpayer in this country has not the slightest idea of how commonplace the practices of data mining, profiling, and reverse redlining were and how these caused thousands of families to lose their homes and their only tangible asset.  Until you can really comprehend the magnitude of these unconscionable practices, you will continue to believe the political pablum you are being fed.|`|23SkYEw5aa	so?|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	I'd be really mad too.

At8D5Xu2aa	Keep your study abroad on your resume if it's relevant to your current situation.  For instance, if you spent a summer in France in college, followed by two seminars in France in the last three years or so, then it's still relevant.<br>  <br>  Likewise with honors.  I think you should keep your *** laude, magna or summa along with your educational background in general.  But if you received some particular accolade when you were, say, 20, you don't want to keep that there unless there have been others that have followed it.  In other words, you don't want it to look like your glory days are all behind you, and you've done nothing extraordinary since college.<br>  <br>  When you're 21, everyone is really interested in what you've done in college and how you may develop.<br>  <br>  At 25, they want to know the person you've become.  Too heavy an emphasis on your college days (worse still your high school days) makes you look like a failure.|`|H2IqzG12aa	I'd just include the highlights.  Basically, your resume (and cover letter) just has to catch someone's attention at a glance.  It's the interview that gets you the job.  Like the ad says about "everything you need and nothing you don't," the resume should tell them why you're right for the job and nothing that says why you might not be.  That is, avoid "TMI".|`|Sozc3MyFaa	It depends on several things.  First, can you shorten some other stuff to include them (most resumes have way to many filler words & obvious things in them); then, how important were the honors & when were they?  As you move higher along the food chain, things from the past get deleted, so may be leave off the oldest stuff.  You can always list honors in a single line (doesn't need to be a sentence or even have explainations etc). Honors: ski captain, reading award, bio comprehensives with distinction.  Interests can probably be cut; theya re sorta fluff anyway, unless they impact the job directly; same with studying abroad--if you are looking for an art job & you studied in Italy-that's important.  Have someone look at your resume after you re-do it & offer suggestions.|`|AA12148387	Small jobs and honors probably aren't necessary for you to keep on your resume. You need keep it concise and only keep the things that highlight what your future employer is looking for.

AA11206283	"address correction requested"|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	There is not.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	What you do is mail it to the last known address. If they provided a forwarding address to the post office, it will be forwarded. If it is returned to you (did not 'stick), they did not provide a forwarding address. You can also mail a confidential item to their work if you are willing to take the risk. Some people do not appreciate that and will consider it on the job harassment. If possible, call their job. Once they tell you not to contact them there, you have to stop.<br>  <br>  You should have all of the information on their application to lease the apartment, including their bank account number. The bank account number is also on the checks you received for rent which should have been copied for this reason. If the amount you are seeking is substantial, an attorney can use that info to gain some leverage.<br>  <br>  Hopefully the deposit covered any costs you incurred. This is the unfortunate part of being a landlord.|`|12neIP0vaa	If the post office won't tell you, mail a letter to that address and see if it is returned to you and with what info.  Also, the IRS has a forwarding service you may be able to use.  You send them the letter and they will forward it to them on your behalf - they know where almost everyone is as long as they file taxes.  Hope you find them!
aI194WRaaa	Oh, boy.  Welcome to my world.  If you're dedicated to your concept, and it sounds like you are, you have to stick with it.  I imagine you knew it would be exhausting.  I've been doing the same for about three years and I knew going in..which is different from the actual experience, of course.  I don't know how much time you have in but, for me, it was like that for a while, then things were pretty level now the economy tanked and I've been struggling again.  I lost two (HUGE) clients when the mortgage crisis first hit but I am back up now, almost to level.  That all being said, take a vacation.  That's the only thing that works for me.  I don't let myself do anything work-related for a week.  By the time the second weekend rolls around, I'm champing at the bit.  I realize that may be impossible but, if it is at all possible,  that's what I suggest.  If it's all that hard, at least take a fake vacation--daycation, weekend away, something special.  Celebrate the b's you had to set out on your own.  As impossible as it is, try to have a life outside of the biz.  Take a day off and go to the movies--by yourself even. It's oddly satisfying when one is an independent business owner such as we.|`|Px7u8NUxaa	I just felt like that in December so I decided to quit the job I had at the time. Don't know if it was the best financial strategy for me but it sure was the right thing to do for my peace of mind (which is my biggest asset).<br>  <br>  Luckily I don't have financial issues right now due to the fact of having saved a considerable amount of money during my previous jobs (this definitively helped me take the decision), but besides this I am sure of one thing... When you get the burn out feeling you should start looking for a new job... It is not about what you can do in your current work that can take away they burn out feeling... It is about doing something in your LIFE (sometimes drastic things) that can shake up your professional career and let you be all you can be in the corporate world...|`|eFkdCBjkaa	I know it's hard, but you need to take a weekend! Go somewhere quiet and beautiful, and restore your soul. You know what they say about all work and no play... you need some fun and a change of scenery.|`|mWukMOAeaa	Think back on what might have started this burnout feeling. If there is something going on in your life that is interrupting your performance? That what you have to change. Sometimes people just need a vacation! If you can, go away for a week. If that's not possible, try going away for a weekend. It is very refreshing to do that. What ever you do you need to have a form of ESCAPE! This will take your mind off of stress and put it in a happy place, renewing you. Good luck and get plenty of rest!
efqHlwyoaa	If you do not have a store, there's no setting for that.<br>  <br>  If it's a 7 day auction, I suggest you add to your description, that you will be away for a few days.

They are not obliged to issue duplicates. <br>  Nice letter though and good luck job hunting.<br>  <br>  Naughty employer! In that case I'd change 'kindly' to Please provide me with a the payslips covering my period of employment with you and P45. If they were paying you off the books then you may have a problem. Fingers crossed for the new job.
6SIjchQUaa	Call the police department and they will provide you with information on the crime rate at the complex.  As far as the bad reviews, you really can't believe them, very rarely will someone who is happy with the place they live write a review.  There were 100's of bad reviews for the apartment complex I live in, talking about roaches and mice and the noise and smell.  I have lived here three years and I don't have any bug problems, of course I keep my place clean!  <br>  <br>  You could also go by the complex one evening as people are coming home and ask current residents what they think of the apartments.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Believe the reviews.  If they were false the company would have sued for removal.  Visit apartments at the dinner hour, that is when a building is the noisiest.
l1VZkkOSaa	That's gotta be a scam. Who in their right mind would offer to pay more for an item than the price it is listed at? At any store - online or not?<br>  <br>  The buyer's going to want to send you a money order for the higher price, which you will deposit, which will later be determined by your bank to be a fake money order. Then you will be responsible for repaying the bank for the amount of the money order (plus fees, of course) - plus you will no longer have the item that you wish to sell.

DON'T fill out those forms UNLESS you go to the 'About Us' section of the web site and determine that the site belongs to an insurance broker and one you wouldn't mind doing business with/talking to.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you're giving your personal information to a lead farm AND for every form you fill out you can expect that your information will be sold a minimum of five times.  So, if you fill out 4 forms you can expect 20 salespeople to be calling you.  And, I say 'salespeople' because some of them won't be insurance agents/brokers.  You'll get calls from all kinds of things you don't want.<br>  <br>  You need ONE insurance broker that you can trust because an insurance broker has most (if not all) of the plans available to you at the same rate you'd get anywhere else.

sI3krJULaa	It differs on a company by company basis- usually depending on what industry they're in.  Sometimes it's based on personal performance.  For instance, a large amount of new billings for an advertising firm.  Sometimes, it's based on departmental performance- for instance, an operations manager for a car company gets costs down.  It can also be determined by how well the company as a whole does (which is why so many people, including congress, were outraged that Merrill Lynch gave out huge bonuses when the company as a whole was in the tank.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)|`|EQKaMfPAaa	It depends. Some companies give bonuses based solely on individual performance while other give them based on company performance.  My company figures in both for our bonuses.  I have also seen bonuses based on things that are done above and beyond normal work scope.

The rest of the house would be 'joint ownership' (such as windows, roof, hallways, lounge , kitchen etc) and you have to pay 30% of the running & maintenance costs (I would assume you also pay 30% of the heating, utility & phone bills & 30% of the Council Tax etc.)<br>  <br>  Needles to say, without knowing how many other bedrooms exist & how many other people live there, it is difficult to judge if 30% is a "fair portion" or not ...<br>  <br>  There is another type of shared ownership that was offered by House Builders, mainly to first time buyers. This really only worked when house prices were going up - they would sell you some portion to start with and you could buy the rest, at the then current, i.e.  higher price, later. You would be responsible for all maintenance costs and all the bills .. Needless to say, with prices going down, no way do they want to sell you only a small percentage now, since when you come to purchase the rest later, the house is likley to be cheaper ..|`|RExvPeD5aa	you start off buying 30%.

AA10259042	Up and coming competitor is not a problem with GE. What is a problem is its loan portfolio.  The fact that it cut its dividend less than two months after the CEO said the dividend was safe does not help the company any either.  <br>  <br>  The company according to its balance sheet has 7.9 billion in net tangible assets and about 430 billion in long term debt and other liabilities.  The debt to equity ratio is more than just high.  It is extreme. That makes the company fall into the category of a bank, and we all know how the banks are doing.  It is nearly as much a finance company as it is a manufacturing company.  There is not unjustified fear that their loans are going to turn sourer.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Demand for every product that is a 'big ticket item' has totally tanked because nobody, not even GE Capital, can offer credit readily.  But even if they could, most potential customers for big ticket items are sitting on their scarce investment capital.<br>  <br>  So, there is a lot of economic repair needed to get manufacturers of big ticket items back into the marketplace.<br>  <br>  But also many companies, like the Big 3 and GE also are loaded down with debt.  We are hoping the big companies find a way to avoid being broken up. But there is no assurance. If there were such assurance the price would be higher. In this case, with risk of bankruptcy and loss of value  means that all of those companies stock is a high risk right now. If they escape that risk, the stock could be a great investment. Most investors are unwilling to buy into that risk unless they already own the stock and do not want to realize the loss.|`|4ooXYuYFaa	Great company to invest in. Definately go for it. Think about the very big picture when you look at companies such as GE. Think of the ripple effect of the housing market and think about when people buy major appliances. People buy Washers, Dryers, Refrigerators, stoves etc when they buy new house. This is a mjaor ripple effect of the housing market - same goes for furniture companies. People aren't spending on these things. On the flip side, the companies that do repairs for durable goods are doing very well because people are repairing versus buying new. <br>  <br>  You also have to think aviation though - what are the airlines doing? They certainly aren't buying new planes! Think consumer finance - consumers aren't spending money, so the consumer finance division is suffering. It is also suffering because of the credit crisis - if people aren't paying their mortgages, they certainly aren't focused on paying their consumer credit bills.<br>  <br>  It's a big picture issue with GE - but they'll be around for generations to come.|`|jAg4AdbTaa	The biggest concern about GE is the GE Capital division which is losing money.

yO5tm6e1aa	Expected Debt to Income ratio should look a little like a bell curve.  In your 20's, you have rapidly growing income with even more rapidly growing expenses.  You may puchase big ticket items like cars and a house, you may pay for a wedding and honeymoon, child birth, child care, and costs associated with setting up a life style.  By the 40's, growth should have stablized and people are generally in an operations mode.  Income growth has slowed (hopefully, keeping with inflation) and loans are getting paid off (e.g. Student Loans, etc).  This will free up some money.  However, kids are also gearing up to go to college.  If the parents finance the college for the kids, this will be another expense.  By 60 years of age, long term loans should come to a close (e.g. Mortgage) and income should be at it's peak.  This is when you should have very little debt to income.  Hopefully, by retirement, you have no debt and lots of income.|`|W76VDFKCaa	If they have gone to college, have a car loan, and a few credit cards, I think they could have around $50-100,000 in debt.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Job costing is simply figuring out what it cost to produce the end product. For example we repair ships so we have different kinds of labor. Union trades work directly doing the work so they have hours and wage rates. For each hour a union worker works we pay the union for his medical, retirement, apprenticeship programs, and we pay payroll taxes for the workers. We also pay our people vacation, holidays and sick days. So you need to compute the cost per hour of keeping a person. Those cost can be charged to the job and built into a formula. It cost us about $64 an hour to employee a worker or three times his wages. <br>  Other job cost that can't be directly tied to a job are things like wages for the payroll clerk, purchasing department, supervisors, accounting.

But I'd call your CC company and explain to them that you're thinking about cancelling the card if you can't negotiate a lower rate.  they'll want to keep you as a customer so more than likely you'll be able to get the lower rate as long as you've got a good credit history.  And I wouldn't fret too much on this APRs are rising all over the place as the economy tightens.|`|yiux97Wbaa	if you have been paying your bills on time and your credit score is good, call the bank and ask them to give you a card with a fixed interest rate  If your young and just starting to build your credit, 11% and 13% isn't all that bad, but I wouldn't let them go any higher, there are other companies out there.|`|DFwvcUnhaa	I got one from Capital one changing my default rate from 23.4 to 29.6% and I declined to accept it.

What's in your wallet?|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	I did and since it is my only credit card I am going to pay it off as quick as I can and keep it active only.  I understand why they are doing this because they are losing their shirts but it isn't totally fair.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Yup.  I got one similar.  <br>  <br>  I am declining.  No way would I accept an interest rate that high.  That's just nuts.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	I got the same type letter, also from Capital One.  I rarely ever pay late (and even then it's only by a few days) so I was pretty angry about it.  I'm not going to cancel it though.  I have removed it from my wallet and will not use it again (unless it's a dire emergency).  I've had this credit card for quite a while and (so far) I still have a pretty high credit limit on it, so it would only hurt my credit if I canceled it.  Credit card companies are all doing this in hopes that people (who are still credit conscious) will pay off their debts, but I think it's going to just turn right around and bite them in the butt.  All they will accomplish by raising rates in the middle of a recession, is to make FAR more people default on their payments.  Now, less of your monthly payment is applied to the principal which just means it's all that much harder to ever get out of debt.  When people have to decide between paying their credit cards or feeding their families, I'm betting they'll chose to take care of their loved ones first and just go into default on their cards.  People are being pushed to a point where their debt is so far gone that they just don't care anymore.  And I don't blame them.  I think what the credit cards are doing should be illegal.  How can you raise rates during a recession, and NOT ruin millions of lives?  I will keep my Capital One card ONLY because it benefits me to do so.  If Capital One lowers my credit limit after I pay them off, THEN I will cancel because it wont benefit my credit report anymore.  And, after the recession when Capital One sends me a lovely letter saying how much they want me back, I will show them no more loyalty or respect than what they've shown me.

My husband was laid off for four months, I was laid off for three months. We didn't make our mortgage payment for three months and are already being foreclosed on. Boy, am I glad our government saw fit to give Citimortgage a HUGE chunk of money to help people like me out. Oh yeah, OUT of my HOME! They wouldn't even just put that three months on the end of the mortgage, not like they were giving us anything, just needed a three month extension on our total loan.

You have to present your case to a judge in court to prove that your landlord has failed to provide your apartment in good condition, and you have to give your landlord a chance to defend himself. Then, if your case is legally valid, the judge will grant you the right to break your lease. In your case, you wouldn't win a lawsuit because crime in the neighborhood is never a valid reason to break a lease.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  While this may be considered a safety issue, by the time you complied with the required process to (possibly) break your lease, 2 months will have expired.  Give your two month notice and plan to move out.  Talk to your landlord about using your deposit as the last month's rent.  Do your move out inspection next month and if all is in order let him use your deposit for the last month's rent.  That way you could move out a month early without penalty.  The security deposit can be used for rent if both parties agree.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|RZzMse3Haa	NO! The landlord is NOT responsible or liable for crime in the area. It is a tenants responsibility to check out a neighborhood before they rent any place.  That is not legal grounds to break your lease.

At the very least, they are required by law to give you a T-4 statement at the end of the year so that you can fill out your income tax form.  If you're not receiving statements, your employer is probably not deducting taxes.  <br>   <br>  Being a caregiver, it is very likely that you are in a very low tax bracket;  you may not be required to pay tax at all.  Make sure you get a T-4 and then file a tax return.  You are probably entitled to a refund, if you have been paying taxes, and you may also be eligible for a quarterly GST rebate.

RqQDKEVHaa	Here's what you do:<br>  <br>  Determine the true value of the homes. Look at homes that have sold in the past 6 months. That'll tell you how much it's worth. And that's the maximum you should offer.<br>  <br>  Forget any formulas of "Offer 10% under listing price." That's meaningless. The listing price (on a new listing) might be a great value as is. Or it could be overpriced by 20%. So you'd end up overpaying if you cut 10% off the listing price.<br>  <br>  Now, if a property's been on the market for a month or longer at some price and it's not selling, that means the price is too high. How high? Impossible to say. But if you've got houses in your neighborhood priced at $65,000-$72,000 and they're not selling, then they're worth something less than $65,000. <br>  <br>  It's true that the lower you offer, the less likely you are to get the property. If you offer $65,000 for that $65,000 property, odds are pretty good you'll get it. Offer $40,000, and the odds drop substantially. (Still, some sellers would accept such an offer.) So, it also depends on how much you really want a particular house. Let's say that the comps, plus price trends, plus the fact that the $65,000 house isn't selling, suggests that the real value of the house is $60,000.<br>  <br>  First, in that scenario, $60,000 is the most you should pay. And you should offer that, or likely less. That's your ceiling. No guarantee the seller will accept that, but that really doesn't matter. You don't want to overpay.<br>  <br>  Then, weigh how much you want the house. The more you want it, the closer to $60,000 your offer should be.<br>  <br>  Then, do some research into the seller's motivations. And into how much equity the seller has in the property. In other words, how much do they want to sell? And how low, in theory, could they go. Let's say the seller has a $40,000 mortgage on the property. Taking into consideration the seller's expenses (real estate commission, etc.), the seller might accept anything above about $45,000. No mortgage at all? The seller might accept less. Your Realtor can help you, to some extent, on these issues.<br>  <br>  Then you make an offer. It'll either be accepted, rejected, or countered. If it's accepted, you offered too much. It will still be a good deal, following the process above, but you could have offered less. If it's countered, that's a very good sign. And even if it's rejected, you can submit a new offer tomorrow if you want.<br>  <br>  So, that's the process to follow. I can't give you a magic number ("10% below the listing price" for instance) because there isn't one.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|Qqz0H2hEaa	Home values (and what is the best thing to offer) varies a huge amount depending from region to region- city to city- and even street to street.<br>  <br>  Find a good local buyer's agent to represent you and give you this kind of great advice (plus advice on a million other things you haven't thought of).

Why are you thinking of moving in 3-5 years? If you pay 6k for rent a year, that's 18k-30k that you could be putting into your home. Why are you waiting?<br>  <br>  I'd offer 50k, so they know you're serious. What happens after the initial offer, I would think, determines the final price. Do inspections and checks on the home to uncover things that will cost additional money. You can find ways to haggle the house lower.<br>  <br>  Start with the least persuasive items. Oh, this is a poor community for this that and the other thing. Bad job market, transitioning community, etc. You want to mention the good with the bad, so you don't sound overly picky.<br>  <br>  Next, do an inspection. Afterwards, list all of the things that need to be done. This is a guarenteed way to lower the cost.<br>  <br>  What it boils down to is their assumed value of the house, and what offers others are giving them.<br>  <br>  Move out sooner than later. This is a good time to jump out there and get a home. I believe there's a 1st time Home Owner's program out there that will reimburse you money if you're a first time buyer. Check it out!|`|AA10478980	I have always believed in buying rather than renting.  Why put your hard earned money into someone else's pocket.  Better to put money into yourself.  Never rent if you have another choice.<br>  <br>  If a house I liked was on the market for $75 K, and that was reasonable for houses in the area, I would look at my own finances and see what I could afford, based also upon how much money I would need to put into the house after purchase.  I would talk with the real estate agent to try to get a feel for how flexible the sellers are, and how eager they are to sell.  Sellers who are eager have most likely already priced their house reasonably, but may be willing to negotiate a little more.  If houses are selling quickly in your area, you need to make sure that you offer what you are willing to pay rather than lose the house.  If houses are not selling that quickly, you may be able to chance offering less, possibly 10% below the asking price, and see what happens.  So if the sellers are asking $75 K, I might offer $67,500 or something like that.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Depending on the price, and how many times the price has been reduced can really regulate what you should offer.  If you're looking in the 65-72K range, and the prices haven't been cut more than twice, I would say for a 72K house, you could probably offer 70, or 69, but not much lower.  The lower the house, the less likely they'd be to go down on the price.  This is a big step.  I took it just a few years ago.  It's def. worth it.  Good luck

This amount is added to the loan amount, paid in cash or paid monthly . It's insurance for FHA not for you so that a certain amount of the mortgage is insured and minimizes their loss in case you default.  Conventional loans with less than a 20%  down  payment require  what is called Premium Mortgage Insurance and again it is to protect the investor, not the mortgagor. With PMI you pay an initial fee and a monthly fee until the mortgage is paid down to 80% of the value.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	FHA requires 4% down as of today.<br>  Closing costs will be minimal - but not sure if out of pocket.<br>  FHA does not look at credit scores, they look at the reports.<br>  Make sure he prints out his out from<br>  annual credit report . com<br>  do not delete old credit card accounts.<br>  Make sure all credit cards are down to 0 balances before applying for his loan.<br>  Derrogatory items can be deleted from the reports after 7 years.<br>  /|`|PA7kYyAxaa	www.bankrate.com<br>  <br>  If he's buying a house, he needs a Realtor.
jZMDYsVOaa	MACD gives the best results and it is easy to use as well. If the MACD line crosses the signal line it means that it’s good time for entry in the direction the MACD line were going. But remember to look for a short trade if MACD line falls below signal line and if it rises above signal line just go along. Now assuming that the price of the currency pair breaks above resistance or below support after the MACD crosses the signal line, then it would be considered as a signal of a big move indeed happening. Both the upward and downward crosses are explained in the diagram above.<br>  <br>  Why wouldn’t MACD work in a range bound market? The problem is that in a range bound market, if you base your market entry points only on the MACD then by the time the indicator catches up to the current price, the price may have risen or fallen terribly to such an extent that making a profitable trade would be near impossible.<br>  <br>  The Euro was down on Wednesday as investors continued to price in the likelihood of an interest rate cut from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England alt on today. The European Central Bank is expected to cut its core rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent, and the Bank of England is expected to lower its rate to 0.5 percent on Thursday, also by half a percentage point. Lower interest rates can weaken a currency as investors move funds to where they earn better returns elsewhere.<br>  <br>  At 5PM GMT, the Euro was flat versus the dollar at 1.2573, down 1% versus the CAD at 1.61, and up slightly to the Swiss Franc at 1.4796.|`|19qtxlqsaa	Use Frap Turbo it use all the best technical signals for Forex trading.

TQVMAZUbaa	Tax brackets are based upon your "taxable" income, which is gross income minus exemptions and deductions.<br>  <br>  That means you would subtract 401k contributions, unreimbursed business expenses, mortgage interest, personal exemptions, etc. from your gross income prior to determining your tax bracket.|`|AA10469473	Your actual tax bracket when you file your return is based on your taxable income.  Your "bracket" for withholding is based on a combination of your gross income (minus any pretax deductions) for the pay period and what you put on your W-4 - that combination gives an estimate of what your eventual bracket will be, if you filled out your W-4 accurately.<br>  <br>  If your overtime is spread reasonably evenly over the year, the deductions will probably be correct or close.  But if some pay periods you have a huge number of overtime hours, and others have little or none, they might take out too much - then you'd get the extra refunded when you file.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Your bracket is based on your gross pay minus 401(k) contributions.  If your income goes into the next bracket,  only the amount over the break is taxed at the higher rate.  If your taxable income is $1,377, part will be taxed at 10% and part at 15%.  If you go over $1,392, only the income over $1,392 will be taxed at 25%.|`|qBCGH52haa	You will most likely fall in the 15% tax bracket.

86e0fcff22774bed26d5e5f6773ca754aa	First be aware that there are a good few scams going around at the moment ... Green Belt land (and land that is in a 'flood plain') is being sold with the promise of 'development potential' without the buyer being aware that getting planning permission for 'change of use' will be almost impossible .... <br>  <br>  In some cases the existing owners have already applied for planning permission and have been rejected ... so they promptly submit an appeal and try to sell the land as 'planning permission applied for' ...<br>  <br>  <br>  Assuming you manage to get permission (from the local Council Planning Dept.) then here are the main hurdles ..<br>  <br>  1) Public Access .. often the (farm) roads will be unsuitable / inadequate for any significant increase in traffic .. if it's a Private Road, it's likley it will be 'shared' and you will need permission from the other users & (no doubt) they will expect you to pay for it to be upgraded. If it's a Public Road, the Council will do the work.. but don't expect them to do it anytime soon (as in, the next 5 - 10 years) ..<br>  <br>  2) The other big issue is going to be Insurance .. needless to say, the Drivers own Insurance will not cover them (check your own policy wording), so, unless you can offer them cover you are going to get every few takers .. and I would have massive reservations about the cost = given that the drivers will be off-roading & 'testing their vehicles to the limit' you can expect a good few accidents as 'boy racers' bump into one-another ...<br>  <br>  Try Norwich Union .. they seem to Insure anything, for a price :-)|`|ARAYm7BLaa	you'll need change of use permission...the neighbours wont like this|`|HP1pToMOaa	I don't think you have a snowballs chance in hell.

It will better for you in the long run.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Normally it is balancing more responsibility, being salaried instead of hourly, working more hours and having a better resume against less responsibility, hourly pay, fewer hours required in a standard work (with overtime for overage).<br>  <br>  Being a manager also means being out of the day to day work usually.    As an example, a computer programmer will spend his day analyzing, designing, enhancing and fixing computer software whereas a manager will mostly handle the budget, priorities.....etc.    The manager will eventually lose his ability to program from being away from the day to day.

This means you are NOT creating ANY equity with all your payments, only paying interest--might as well be renting. And you have way too much debt on this house.

And if you're selling house in two years, not sure you recover your re-fi costs.|`|NmshFbxhaa	absolutely !!!!!!<br>  get a fixed rate as soon as possible and do not borrow extra at this time|`|qBCGH52haa	Running the numbers real quickly, you actually end up costing yourself about $900 if you refinance.  Here's why:<br>  <br>  Since you are interest only for the next two years, (and without running continuous compound interest), your current mortgage should cost you about $23,350 in interest for that time.  Your second mortgage at the rate you gave is going to be another $9,720 in interest (I didn't take into account any paydown of principal which would actually lower that figure - but I figure it a wash with the additional compound from the first mortgage).  So, over the next two years, you will pay about $33,069 in interest if you do nothing.<br>  <br>  If you refinance and combine the two mortgages into one, at the rate given, you are talking two years of interest that will total $25,042 (I used the mortgage/amort calculator at bankrate.com).  Add in the closing costs of $4,500 and the points of $1,709 and you get total costs of $31,251, which looks like a small savings.  However, the new mortgage (assuming the appraisal is correct at $300,000) puts you $2,000 over the 80% loan to value ratio needed to avoid PMI which will be another $113 a month.  Assuming you roll the entire points and closing costs into the new mortgage (which will increase the interest also, but I am ignoring that), you won't get below the 80% mark where you can drop PMI until after the 2 years is up.  So, PMI for two years will add up to about $2700, putting you at 2-year costs of almost $34,000, compared to the roughly $33,100 you would pay out now.<br>  <br>  If you don't roll the closing and points into the new mortgage, you would be able to drop PMI in about 6 months, meaning you would spend only $678 on PMI and end up saving about $1,000 over the next two year.  If you can come up with an additional $2,000 down, plus closing, plus points, that would drop PMI altogether (plus lower your interest a bit) and save you about $1,7000.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you sell much before the 2 years, the refinance will almost certainly cost you money.

cc771ae38bd5ed69cd69113006774f1eaa	There are two ways to increase traffic to your site:<br>  <br>  1. Pay-per-click<br>  <br>  This type of advertising allows you to set up an account and buy clicks by setting up a maximum amount you are willing to pay-per-click.  An example of this would be using Google adwords or Yahoo search marketing.  <br>  <br>  Once you purchase clicks, you set your account up to appear when certain keywords are searched for.  The ad will appear at the top or along the side of the search results, where it says "sponsored results."  Each time someone clicks on your ad, it will cost you.<br>  <br>  2.  Increasing Your Organic Search Engine Placement<br>  <br>  This refers to where your site places within the search engine results for keywords that relate to your business.  There are several ways to increase your site's placement but I am only going to review the most important ones.<br>  <br>  - The overall design of your website will impact the placement it receives within search engines.  Web sites that are mostly flash or graphics and that contain very little text will not good placement because search engines cannot index this content.  Sites with bad code also cannot be indexed.<br>  <br>  - The content of your website should be interesting and original.  It should contain the keywords that you want individuals to search for within search engines but not so many times it seems overused while being read by a human.<br>  <br>  - Ones of the most important things that google bases their placements on is linkbacks.  This means they check to see how many sites link back to your site.  The sites that link back should be sites that are good quality and relevent to your site content and industry.

kifwyOgKaa	Yes, just contact the hospital's billing department, explain your situation, and they will help you set up a payment plan.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Judy is correct once you make the payment plan there is absolutely no grace period. One payment one day late and they turn you over to a collectionagen cy. I know that for a fact, I once had to make payments for a hospital and I figured I had at least  a 10 day grace period. You don't and the next people I heard from was a collection agency. Thankfully it had gotten down to a pretty small balance so I could pay it off right away before it had accumulated a ton of interest and attorney fees. The hospital does not charge interest which is why I hadn't paid the full amount before.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	Contact the hospital.  Some will set up a payment plan.  Most want the bill paid within 3 to 6 months.  Get the payment plan in writing.<br>  <br>  If you just sent in payments, the hospital will take the payment but after 90 days they will probably send the account to collections.  The collection agency would then report the debt to the credit bureaus.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "good faith payment".  Hospitals, like any other creditor, do not have to accept whatever small payment you want to sent.  They can take that $30 and still turn the account over to collections.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, usually.

AA11966821	You prepare your own Notice to Quit, but it must be in "proper legal form."  There is no set form like a fill-in-the-blanks application form or tax return form, etc, as you probably think of the meaning of the word "form."  Instead the law refers to the wording you use:  certain elements and wording must be there.  Go to the public library and ask the reference librarian if they have the Nolo Press guide to landlord-tenant law for your state, or what guides they do have for your state.  That should give you at least one of the acceptable "proper" wordings for a Notice to Quit, as well as legal procedure for serving the notice, what else you have to do, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are a landlord, buy the bloody book!

Hope this helps :)|`|eoFyvtYcaa	At only 23 years old, the founder of social networking website Facebook Mark Zuckerberg reign in as the youngest self-made billionaire in the world. Announced by Forbes magazines yearly billionaire list Mr. Zuckerberg shot up to #785 on the list.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Mark-Zuckerberg_I9UB.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/bill...</a><br>  <br>  Matthew Miller, Forbes Associate Editor announced that billionaire history had been made when he stated, “He is the youngest billionaire in the world right now and we also believe he is the youngest self-made billionaire in history.” Mark Zuckerberg is even hanging around the likes of Oprah Winfrey who has $1.5 billion network. Although Winfrey is ranking above Zuckerberg they are both stated to be worth $1.5 billion.<br>  <br>  One question that has been raised was how Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was calculated. Some argue that Mr. Zuckerberg is much richer than $1.5 billion when taking into account the $240 million dollar Microsoft invested in Facebook for a 1.6 percent stake in Facebook in 2007. With Microsoft’s investment it places Facebook at market valuation of $15 billion. Mark Zuckerberg holds a 30% stake in the company which would have placed him with $5 billion in net worth.<br>  <br>  The Forbes magazine made a statement about how they came up with the valuation when they said, “Would it really fetch that much today? Some analysts — and a few Facebook investors — doubt it.” The Facebook valuation is said to be stated on the estimated annual sales of $150 million dollars. The annual sales were mainly in advertisement revenue deals with Microsoft.<br>  <br>  Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in February 2004 from his Harvard dorm room. After dropping out of school and moving to Silicon Valley Facebook found venture capitalists ready to made their stake in the fast growing social network. Now Mr. Zuckerberg can have his bragging rights, he is the youngest self-made billionaire in history.|`|hXuuAxmuaa	Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg|`|AA11170671	Not sure on that.|`|oDGttkmLaa	HEY ..you asked a Q!

Those dues can change depending upon the maintanence needs of the development.  A lot of people may not be aware of this but home warranties are a joke.  So do not rely on it to replace anything when something breaks.  I learned this the hard way.  My advice is to always have money in your savings, at least $2K, and/or a credit card with an open limit.  I had to replace the heat pump and air handler, on the 1 yr anniversary of my home purchase. The total cost was $4900.  My home warranty company (Home Shield) denied my claim because the unit had not been properly maintained for the life of the system, not the life of my ownership.  Just maintain a financial cushion because you never know what could happen.  You sound financially reserved, so you will be able to handle the ups and downs of homeownership.  Congrats on your new home.

Ja9DNpC6aa	There is a lot to it, but your lender should have no problem assisting you with this (if they know what they are doing, that is).  Here's a quick rundown of what you would need to give a lender so they can determine this for you.  Please note, it's difficult to do this on your own because taxes and insurance must be escrowed, and prorated taxes and an aggregate adjustment need to be determined.<br>  <br>  1 -- You need to know how much the property taxes are and when they are due.<br>  2 -- You will need to get a quote for home owner’s insurance to cover the full loan amount.<br>  3 -- Is the home in a flood zone and if yes, you will need a quote for flood insurance.<br>  4 -- Are there any Home Owner’s Association fees?  If so, how much?<br>  5 -- How much earnest money are they going to require you to put down?<br>  6 -- What is the contact information for the title company that is going to be used so that you can get their basic fees directly from them?<br>  7 -- What is the living square footage of the home and what is the property address (to determine property taxes)?<br>  <br>  To give you an estimate, your closing costs and prepaid items (which should also be included in "seller assist") should amount to somewhere around $4,000 to $7,000, give or take, in Austin, TX.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

lGoHHtcRaa	I know both actually. I have my Real Estate License and have worked in the industry for a a few years.  With the market the way it is today you definitely need maximum exposure.  It will take many hours and it is not easy.  There are allot of legal aspects that you need to be aware of so you do not end up getting yourself sued later down the road for not disclosing something pertinent etc.  I definitely believe you can sell your home without an agent if you have some idea of what you are doing.  There is an awesome book out there called Selling Your Home For Maximum Profits (without an agent). <br>  <br>  You can view it at www.knowingispowershop.com under their real estate books.  Yes, of course I want to have listings and sell homes but everyone's situation is different and if paying thousands of dollars to someone like me for something you believe you can do seems like the better choice then I say go for it.

When potential buyers tour your home you as the owner tend to be less objective and therefore less able to discuss potential.  A buyer may also want to have an agent by his/her side to guard their best interest.  If you do wish to sell it yourself, think of where you look to find a house.  I drive around looking in areas I am interested in - so a yard sign is a must - with fliers listing all the details and the price.  Newspaper advertising is expensive - but check out the ads to see what wording would catch your eye. In a quick sale market the agents don't do much - but in a down turn like now they can eat up the fees in advertising and promotion - they also get it listed so other agents know it is on the market.  As for trying to get an agent to reduce the fee% - that just keeps other agents from wanting to cooperate in the sale by bringing in buyers. You could wait till the agent gets a buyer and the negotiating begins - then when the buyer wants you to reduce your price you can ask the agents to also reduce their share - may work may not.|`|AA10198086	We sold ours without any help except the paperwork after we found a buyer.

Generally speaking using an agent saves you time, hassle, and you end up making more money.  Most buyers use agents because they desire their experience/protection and by using the multiple listing service have many more properties to chose from.  This is especially true in a slow and declining real estate market.<br>  <br>  The first house I owned I tried to sell without an agent.   60 days later I finally listed it with an agent and she sold it in a week and got way more than enough extra to cover her commission.  This was after wasting weekend after weekend doing open houses, being insulted by "jack-asses", and way below market offers.<br>  <br>  The only times I did sell without an agent was when I sold to a tenants that were already living on the premises.<br>  <br>  Buyer that don't use agents tend to be "bottom feeders"  looking to make take advantage of a stupid seller.  About 90% of all properties are sold through a broker.  Just using those odds should make it clear that the chances of selling your home on your own is great diminished.<br>  <br>  About 85% of all homes that are "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) never sell or eventually end up being sold by an agent.  In a hot real estate market it might make sense to try sell it on your own, but not in a market where 40%-60% of the properties that do sell are REO foreclosures.<br>  <br>  If you have a lot of time and patience try it, but remember we are in a declining market and every month that passes your property goes down in value.

fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	You want to appear confident, but not desparate or arrogant. <br>  <br>  Do some research on the company you are applying for, so you know their business, the culture, what they produce, the customers, anything that shows their strategic thinking, their mission and values. That way, you have a basic understanding of where they are going, and more importantly, how you personally can contribute something to their organization.<br>  <br>  Listen well, and as you are answering questions, be honest and sincere. Dress appropriate for the interview, and be polite. <br>  <br>  Remember that you are being silently interviewed from the time you pull into the driveway until you leave the premises, outside of their view. So, maintain professionalism at all times, even to the people in the lobby. <br>  <br>  It's okay not to know every answer off the top of your head. Sometimes the questions are designed to understand your thought process and reasoning ability. So, maintain a friendly face at the interview. <br>  <br>  And, ultimately, maintain the focus about them, not on  you.

WYwqDaapaa	If you had no tax liability last year and you don't expect to have one this year, then you can claim exempt. The main problem is that employers don't understand this category and will probably put you down as Single and 0 exemptions. Check your paystub and if they are not deducting properly, let them know. At 16 you will probably have little or no tax liability and you are better off getting that money throughout the year than having to lend the government money and wait for a refund at tax time.|`|AA10469473	If you make under $5450 for the year, you can file as exempt, otherwise file your W-4 with zero allowances.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If you also have unearned taxable income, even just interest on a savings account, probably not.<br>  <br>  If you expect to make more than a few thousand dollars by the end of the year, probably not.<br>  <br>  If you had any tax liability, even $0.51, on your tax return for 2008 (or will, when you file it), then definitely not.<br>  <br>  If this is your ONLY income and you make only a few hundred dollars a year AND you had no tax liability last year, probably yes.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	The exemption on the W-4 refers to the number of filing exemptions that will be used in your 1040 form (i.e., the number of dependents).<br>  <br>  You have to pay tax on income.

efqHlwyoaa	I know it would work.  On a well-stocked store, you have no problem doing that.  But if per chance, the stuff you sold is the stuff that the store is sold out of, you will have a very pissed off customer.<br>  <br>  Try this:  Buy the stuff you think can sell.  If no one buys, take the receipt and product back, and return them.<br>  <br>  Best thing is to find them cheap and for sure they will sell.|`|x2Gl6EM7aa	It might work but people noramlly shop around for cheaper prices. If they find that what you are selling is cheaper in stores then they will go to the store because for one it is cheaper by far because don't forget you still have to pay for shipping/handling Which makes it even more expensive and you also have to wait for it. Would you rather pay $50 in stores and get it now or pay $75 and have to wait two weeks? Just a heads up but go a head and try it anyways its worth a shot. What's life without risks? Good Luck in selling whatever it is you are selling!

EzrdyxAiaa	look you never do it you insure that if you have to finance a car the amount is so low your get the best rate available -- you need to just double you payments get it paid for and start saving so you can pay cash for the next one!!!|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	You never refinance a car.  That is just bad business all it does is keep you in debt on a car that is losing value every year.  I don't know of a single financial expert who would think that this is a good idea.  As a matter of fact, most good financial experts would say that you should save up and pay cash for any vehicle you purchase.
pkwkQfEYaa	It's an awesome idea. Let no one discourage you. The question you must ask yourself is that is this worth it to you. You'll make $132 after you sell 300 cans. How long will that take? How many graffti artist have you in your school? I think that the experience you'll gain from doing this is definetly worth trying. You never know what might happen. Going forward consider this SWOT. S is for strenghts, W is for weaknesses, O is for oppurtunities, and T is for threats. After you carefully examine your SWOT, you'll be able to make the decision if you want to go forward. For example, based on what you said, your S would be that it sounds unique and that there's a market. W could be that fact that you aren't making that much money for all the work. $132 can easily be earned by mowing 4 lawns on a weekend. O is where you can go with it. i.e what oppurtunities does this business lead to. My guess maybe you could eventually become a dealer for graffiti artists. T is your threats. What stops someone else from doing it when they see you. What happens if a retail store starts sellilng your paint etc In my opinion, its ok but if you're a risk taker then GO FOR IT! GOOD LUCK.

Uc7GM2Rnaa	If you have equity in your home... meaning its worth more than you owe it is better to re-fi.<br>  <br>  No lender will work with you on a mod unless you are behind in your payments.  Which will put your credit scores back in the trash.  So if your making your payments, keep doing so as you look into refinancing.<br>  <br>  I am curious though as to what you consider an outrageous rate of interest.  Most ARMs are tied to an index.  Index plus a margin makes your rate.  Most margins are between 3 and 4.5%.. indexes are now below 2% (like LIBOR)..   <br>  <br>  Send me a msg, let me know what your index is and what your margin is.  They'll be stated in your original loan docs.|`|AA10886262	it's easier to re-finance with the company you have, with that said, look for the lowest rates, lowest points, lowest fees.......and go with that company|`|QCTiZnz0aa	The adjustments for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) will continue through 2010 and into 2011.

Subdivide is also VERY costly, you will pay huge fees for teh rezoning and drawing of many many maps.|`|suWnr83laa	It depends on the size of the lots and the zoning in your community.

4MypYVHYaa	You would know if you had a lease to purchase, because you would have signed such a contract prior to moving in the house.<br>  <br>  Now if you desire to purchase the house you would have to approach your landlord about the methods under which he is willing to sell the house.<br>  <br>  #1 You might be required to qualify for and obtain a mortgage through a lender or bank.<br>  <br>  #2  The land lord might consider a lease with an option to own with a portion of the rent you pay each month being set aside by the landlord as the down payment. He could also lease the house to you with none of the rent going toward the down payment.<br>  <br>  #3  The landlord might consider selling you the house and acting as the lender/bank by carrying the mortgage loan himself.<br>  <br>  If you do not get a mortgage from a lender/bank then most down payment assistance programs offered by most cities and counties will not be available to you because they do not want to have a mortgage behind a owner carried 1st mortgage.<br>  <br>  To find out the requirements of a down payment assistance program you might call the city or county in which you live to see what is available to you. <br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|AA11513482	It's not Lease To Own without Earnest money in the beginning of lease by you.  If you want this home first find out what home like it sell for.  Then find out if you can get a bank loan for that amount.  If he was selling the house he would list it for "Market Value'.  But he would pay 3-6% RE fee's.  So let him know you want the house and are willing to give him what it is worth and save him money on selling it.

For example, a very simple (small) change (for the short term) you can make is to change your new contributions to be 90% cash (money fund) and 10% stock...or 50% cash, 25% Bond, 25% Stock.

Use credit repair service to find and remove such bad stuff from your credit - freecreditreport.hotusa.org|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Contact the credit bureau and ask.  Normally only you can freeze your report.  Maybe you are the victim of identity theft.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You are the victim of identity theft. This is how most people find out, they get turned down for credit and then find the credit is not theirs. I hat to say this but often it is a family member using your name and Social Security number, especially if you are a junior.....not an accusation just some of the ways this is done. It's also done and you never know who did it. I assume you disputed the debt with all three credit bureaus and made sure there are no other trade lines on your credit report that are not yours. Since you were below the age of entering entering into a contract when this mortgage was taken out all you should need is proof of age. They will probably  accept your drivers license. Have all three credit bureaus flag your reports that someone has committed fraud. You can probably have them call you whenever a new tradeline shows up on your credit report to confirm you opened it.|`|wEXxkgaXaa	If your credit report is actually frozen, that's good because that means that no one can access it without your permission. The problem is that if you didn't do it, you don't have the access PIN code. You'll need to file a police report or report with the FTC (ftc.gov). MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS! Even if it doesn't help you, having a ID theft report on file enables you to have free credit freezes on your reports for life in any state.<br>  <br>  You'll need to make sure that any credit reports under your SSN are corrected, returned to your control, and frozen. Then you will have very little to worry about for future ID theft.|`|RxeQJcqhaa	I believe those are security questions to verify your identity online when doing one of those free credit report deals. You would have answered several questions "no" and then perhaps one comes up that does apply to you, like "You have a student loan with Bank XYZ" or something like that. I don't know about the freeze you are mentioning. Did you try to do more than one report, after you got all those weird questions on the first one?   That might have red-flagged at equifax and made it appear someone was trying to steal your identity.  Call them. :)|`|fZEVgFe8aa	You need to go to annualcreditreport.com and get the phone number to call and order your free report from all three of the reporting agencies.  No strings attached, this is the real deal, not the ads you see on TV that say free but ultimately aren't.  I think it's the law that you be allowed free access to your credit report. Never trust those TV commercials, they are very misleading.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do that, you need to go online or call the three agencies directly to order your credit report at a cost of @ 6-8 dollars each.  I'm talking Trans, Experian, and Equifax.<br>  <br>  I have to admit, I don't really get what you are trying to say.  A credit freeze is when you are not allowed credit, not when you can't get your credit report.  Another type of freeze is when a consumer freezes his credit report so it can not be accessed by anyone to read or get credit illegally in his name.<br>  This you do yourself and is a protection against identity theft.<br>  <br>  Could someone else have put a freeze on your credit report without you knowing it?  Contact the three agencies directly and do it quick.<br>  This is too important not to follow through.  You don't want to be a victim of fraud or have your credit damaged in any way.

I bought a house in August of '07 and had similar thoughts.<br>  <br>  My mortgage payment, including escrow and PMI and a little extra toward the principal each month, is about 30% of my take-home pay and I am doing fine as far as other expenses and being able to save each month.  I have one car payment, a credit card payment, and the normal utility bills. You just have to have a budget and stick to it.  <br>  <br>  I think you would be okay at 33% unless you have a lot of other expenses.  But without more financial information it is difficult to say.<br>  <br>  If you would just send your bank account and any credit card numbers to me...<br>  <br>  Just kidding.  ;-)  Best of luck on your purchase.|`|AA11513482	If your job is stable 33% is great.

7HKTDcvYaa	The question here is, is the bond FDIC insured? Not likely.<br>  <br>  So in event that the bank goes bankrupt, the bonds have precedence over stock in the residual assets of the bank. <br>  Of course there might be no residual assets.<br>  <br>  Bonds are not issued with convertibility to common stock, but some preferred shares are also not so issued. This is not a uniform distinction. The only time bonds are converted to stock is when the company goes bankrupt or is at serious risk of going bankrupt.<br>  <br>  Bonds that have deferred payment of interest should always compound. It would be a case for a class action suit if they do not offer to do so.

It calls for the liquidation of the person's assets and extinguishment of the person's liabilities to the extent permitted by law.<br>  <br>  Succinctly, an estate is created whereby all "non-exempt" assets are transferred into the estate to pay off all dischargeable debts.  If the bankruptcy estate has insufficient assets (and it will in a Chapter 7), then the remaining debts are expunged.<br>  <br>  The non-exempt assets and the non-dischargeable debts return to the person.

ysUqQ9Qkaa	I am by no means an expert on English tennant law, but I would suspect that if the town council told him that it's illegal for him to rent a room out that's that small he probably is legally obliged not to.  I would think that you may be able to petition the council for an exemption to the law on the grounds that you the current tennant doesn't feel it's too small and that the location/rent was an acceptable price-point.  But like I said I'm not an expert on English rental law.  But ￡300 for a 9*12?  That seems kind of steep.  I once paid $875/mo for a 12*20 though so maybe it's not that bad . . . my place also strangely had a hole in the bathroom floor, even though it should have been foundation under there, so who knows how shitty that place was.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Thats very high rent for a room of that size so he is probably right, if its against the law and you have to move out then there is nothing you can do about it, you will have to find somewhere else.

AA10666701	Ok so you are 18 which means you are probably still in school. If you are still in school then getting a credit card will be easy for you because student cards have no income or credit history requirements. If you aren't a student then you will probably have to start out with a prepaid card(they usually don't have any of the following).<br>  <br>  You want a card that does not have an annual fee, gives you some types of reward (like points), low APR. To find out what a low APR is compare the card to other cards that you are interested in. If it is student card then compare it to other student cards. You can do this at: www.creditcards.com and www.financeglobe.com/Finance/<br>  <br>  Choose a card that is relevant to you. I like the citi mtvU card for students because it gives you points for good grades (if nothing else a student gets grades). Look for a card that will allow you to take maximum advantage of whatever reward it offers.<br>  <br>  Remember you don't have to pay interest to earn credit! Use your card for average everyday purchases and then pay it off in full. Stay under 30% of your credit limit. Don't request a limit increase before you have had the card for 6 months (most companies will raise the limit automatically on the 6 month mark). You will have earned a credit score after 6 months of having something reported.<br>  <br>  You can get a free copy of your credit report from all 3 bureaus once a year at www.annualcreditreport.com<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to look at your report every year just to make sure everything is correct and that no one is using your name some place.<br>  <br>  Just a note. What that other person said about using credit on your debit card is incorrect. The credit feature on debit card does not build credit. I also suggest you read a book called Smart Debt by Jason Rich.

That way you don't spend what you don't have and as long as when you use it, you say it's credit rather than putting in the pin, it will increase your credit rating. It still will take it from your checking account though. Also, I use Chase bank and whenever I say credit, they have me signed up for a rewards program...so I get money back either in cash or as gifts. I always choose the cash. Please don't get into credit debt. I've been there and done that and have learned from my mistakes many years ago. I never will get a credit card again. Personally...I only suggest having a house loan and no other types of loans...even buying a car...pay cash and get something that's used.|`|H0uovbcaaa	Your best bet would be to go to your bank and apply for a starter credit card.

It's free.  It's not a real FICO but you can use it to track your score.

Make this a priority...don't let your cards get charge-off because this will make your bad credit even worse and it's impossible to undo the damage after a charge-off.<br>  <br>  If you need, help, contact your local Red Cross for a referral to the local Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) in your area. They can negotiate much lower payments and interest rates. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.<br>  <br>  They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program.... Otherwise, it can be a very good way to deal with your debt.<br>  <br>  If you need student loans, this may affect your ability to qualify so be careful.|`|sNaTBPvdaa	Your history suggests that your credit score will be low probably around 400 to 500 which means you will pay more than others for the product you wish to purchase on credit.

This will help somewhat, but your credit will still be worse than if you had paid on time.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	The worst thing is to get more credit, if you could, when you've<br>   been late on the credit you already have. That looks as if you are either using one card to pay another or you have no idea on how to handle your money. Only time will heal these wounds. Continue paying timely on the credit you have and get the balances down to no more than 35% of the credit available. A word of warning several cc companies have abolished the grace periods. If you are even one day late your interest rate is immediately raised to a much higher one. One day late won't affect your credit but it will make your payments higher.

Hx88UGlpaa	Depending on  your income and your wifes, you can file a bankruptcy, either a chapter 7 or chapter 13 without your wife filing. You can opt to keep things on either filing. You can contact a bankruptcy attorney in your area and get in to see them on a free consultation. They will look at both incomes, your assets, debts, taxes and be able to tell what you qualify for. Other than paying the debt off, getting a second job to help, not much else you can do. If you don't pay it off, they will sue you, garnish wages, garnish bank accounts up to 100%, attach leins to any property you own. Bankruptcy should be your absolute last resort, but, it is an option if you have no other one.

When you do an appraisal it is compared to like properties, so just 2 Stories are used on yours. There are a lot of variables, but condition is a biggy. If your house is "lived in", then the appraiser would reflect that in the overall value. The site size is important, location within the development/subdivision, curb appeal/landscaping, other updates such as solid surface counter tops, an updated Kitchen or bath, etc.   While you mention 400 sf more, is that under roof and heated/cooled? If you're considering a 3 season porch or something of that nature, it doesn't count in appraisal as "living space".  <br>  <br>  I'm sure this isn't the answer you were seeking to hear. But it's the truth.  We all think our homes are worth more than the neighbor's, it's natural.|`|QdtppqFPaa	Do either of you have a basement?  Is it finished?  What about the size of the yard?  Do either of you have a permanent shed/storage unit?  The selling price of your neighbor's house may have been higher as well.  If you are really concerned, your county auditor can reappraise your house.  Just remember, though, if your house appraisal is higher, your property taxes will be higher as well.
AA10154955	Here are some examples I found. You need to beware of adverse action of denial.<br>  <br>  Take the Case of...<br>  <br>      1. A landlord who orders a consumer report from a CRA. Information contained in the report leads to further investigation of the applicant. The rental application is denied because of that investigation.<br>  <br>      Since information in the report prompted the adverse action in this case, an adverse action notice must be sent to the consumer.<br>  <br>      2. An applicant with an unfavorable credit history, like past-due credit accounts, who is denied an apartment. Although the credit history was considered in the decision, the applicant's poor reputation as a tenant in his current location played a more important role.<br>  <br>      The applicant is entitled to an adverse action notice because the credit report played a part, however minor, in the denial.<br>  <br>      3. A person with an unfavorable credit history, like a bankruptcy, but no other negative indicators, who applies for an apartment. Rather than deny the application, the landlord offers to rent the apartment, requiring a security deposit that is double the normal amount.<br>  <br>      The applicant is entitled to an adverse action notice because the credit report influenced the landlord's decision to require a higher security deposit from the applicant.<br>  <br>      4. A landlord who hires a reference-checking service to verify information included on a rental application. Because the service reports that the applicant does not work for the employer listed on the application, the rental application is denied.<br>  <br>      The applicant is entitled to an adverse action notice. The report is a consumer report from a CRA (the agency checking the references provided by the consumer on the application), and its report influenced the landlord's decision to deny the application.<br>  <br>      5. A landlord who makes it a practice to approve an application if the prospective tenant shows an adequate income or has a favorable credit report, is dealing with an applicant who has an inadequate income and a bad credit report.<br>  <br>      The applicant is entitled to an adverse action notice because the credit report influenced the denial, even though income was another factor.<br>  <br>  Non-Compliance with the FCRA  Landlords who fail to provide required disclosure notices face legal consequences. The FCRA allows individuals to sue landlords for damages in federal court. A person who successfully sues is entitled to recover court costs and reasonable legal fees. The law also allows individuals to seek punitive damages for deliberate violations of the FCRA. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), other federal agencies and the states may sue landlords for non-compliance and get civil penalties.<br>  <br>  However, a landlord who inadvertently fails to provide a required notice in an isolated case has legal protections, so long as he or she can demonstrate "that at the time of the . . . violation he maintained reasonable procedures to assure compliance" with the FCRA.|`|AA11966821	Set your credit standards and minimum income levels according to the rent you charge.  If your 2 BR goes for $2000/mo, require a minimum monthly income at least 3 times rent (or 3x rent + utilities), and require employment & income verification.  Set your minimum credit score or credit standards.  E.g. "no late payments over 60 days in the past 3 years."<br>  <br>  Then for each applicant, apply exactly the same standards when evaluating the application.  Once the applications and credit reports are all in, pick the tenant with the highest income & credit of the bunch.  <br>  <br>  If anyone ever accuses you of discrimination, you should be able to say "I require a minimum income of $6500/month to ensure my tenant does not get in over his/her head on rent & utilities, and this applicant makes only $5000/mo."  The only way they could get you on discrimination then would be if you accepted a tenant with $4900/mo income.|`|5veU5nSwaa	I believe you are correct otherwise what would be the purpose of allowing landlords to run a credit check, you can call your local department of consumer portection to double check and make sure you aren't doing anything illegal by denying the application.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	When do you ever need to explain?

This year they are going to the States to Spend and hire.  The only way they would qualify is if they did not receive any last year and this year they do qualify.  Those who got no benefits or lower benefits last year may be eligible for the remainder this year.  As of yet that is all we get.|`|utbfT0APaa	No, it's for people who work. They probably won't get it either, at least not until 2013.
DAMZKbpDaa	I don't think the IRS cares if you are a girl or a guy.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't even know how to change it, once the taxes are filed.<br>  <br>  You might point out to your father that you are actually his son, not his daughter. For next year, if it applies.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	if it's a problem your parents will be notified and will be asked to fix the error.so don't you worry about it.it's their problem not yours,so relax!

AA11173563	no mip but you have a funding fee of 2% and yes almost all loans have the taxes and insurances impounded into the monthly note|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Conventional loans are better because they are less expensive for the borrower. <br>  VA loans have a "guarantee" instead of PMI which is insurance. The veteran pays for that guarantee.<br>  You must have an escrow account on a VA loan..|`|aZXnW6AUaa	va loan
QWCBoTtraa	Be very care full what your entering online!!
4UBxVIYFaa	Sorry, but lenders do not do that.  They look at your taxable income.  Regardless of how much you THINK you made, it's the taxable income that they look at.  It is GREAT when you get to write off a bunch of your income, EXCEPT when you are looking for a loan.|`|AA11173563	did the lender add back any depreciation and 1/2 self employment taxes for each year as well?|`|aZXnW6AUaa	defenitly so
WGSuDLcZaa	You leased the camping site.  Take the lease copy to the local law enforcement office and tell them you want your cousin off your property.  He is trespassing.  You don't have to say any other information.  Just the plain facts.  You are emotionally involved in this and have to take a step back and breathe.  <br>  <br>  To get the back rent -  file in small claims court.  Take the agreement papers with you.  Once you get a judgement garnish his wages.  He seems irresponsible and immature.  Take the high road - and don't make any more agreements in the future with this jerk!  If you can -  pay back your grandmother for the camper, she sounds like a blessing!
L4rlu2BDaa	Architects can work very long hours if they have a project currently going on, can be a from 7am till 10pm job if someone requires your services. They usually don't have set work hours but it's usually office based with outside meetings with clients, so you can expect to be working the normal 9-5 routine but overtime is a certainty.<br>  <br>  Architects are well paid, especially if you work for a big firm or decide to run your own business. There wages are along the lines of those of lawyers, accountants etc. If you work for a large business you will most likely get a set salary but earn commission and hefty bonuses on top for bringing in clients. An architect can earn up to ￡100,000 a year. But this is for high end well qualified architects. From a starting job you'd be looking at more ￡15,000 -  ￡25,000 and increasing as you gain experience.<br>  <br>  Qualification wise, you need to have a good understanding and interest in maths and science as well as a good eye for detail and the ability to draw and have a good idea of design. Most stuff is now computerised, so a good knowledge of computer design programmes will help you a long way. Most architects will study a lengthy college course in design and then go on to a good 4-5 year course at uni studying there specific choice of architecture. whether you want to choose residential buildings, or specialise in commercial buildings. So getting all A-Cs in GSCE, preferably at least a B in math and science. Getting top marks in your a levels and going on to an art and design college. each college and course decides what qualifications you need so look into the colleges you'd like to study at and see what they require you to have.<br>  <br>  GCSE topics aren't overally important. Its what you choose once you've finished school that will count. But try to do a design course or one that allows you to be creative without to many boundaries.
