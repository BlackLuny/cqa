20090307195541AAX1AvI	Local Businesses;Australia;Other - Australia	Difficulty seeking work in Australia?	I moved over to Australia 5 months ago, and in spite of a stellar CV, still can't obtain work. I keep getting rejected on the basis of "no Australian experience". This appears to be a common line. My circumstances are further exacerbated by the current economic climate.      Does anyone have any ideas/ contacts? I am willing to relocate anywhere. I've tried all the job network sites/ recruiters already.
