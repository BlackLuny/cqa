20090304123010AAhTPrC	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	SQL current Month as column heading?	Is there a way to make the name of the current month a column heading in a SQL SELECT statement without hardcoding it? I would like it to automatically change when the next month starts. I tried using a statement similar to: SELECT Period24 AS MONTH(GETDATE()) FROM...      The problem is our system uses a rolling 24 months where the field 'period24' represents This month; 'period23' represents Last month; and so on. So whenever the month changes I need to change all my queries so they still refer to the right months.      Any Ideas?       I am using MS SQL Server 2000      Thanks in advance

This is the same battery I used unplugged for about an hour 2 days ago. I have a dell inspiron 1520 and the battery is over a year old. I have had other laptops and battery life normally begins to decrease and that is how you tell you need to replace it but this time I just woke up and I simply can't run the laptop using the battery. Is it really the battery that ran out of life or could there be something wrong with the charger or in windows itself? Any ideas on how to check or any thoughts are greatly appreciated.
20090304103643AAfaWvd	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My Dell Inspiron 1525 (with Vista) won't boot up!!?	When I turn it on, it goes to the Windows Error Recovery page, and regardless of what mode configuration I choose, it won't boot up.  If I choose Safe Mood it loads Windows files, but then the screen goes black (with a white cursor) for a few minutes.  Eventually the Dell logo will show up, then the Microsoft Corporation logo (with moving green bars).  It sounds like it's loading something, but nothing more happens until it starts the whole process over again (returning to the Windows Error Recovery page).        Besides wondering about what might be wrong and how to get it repaired, I am concerned about losing unsaved files.        Thanks for your help!

20090304111536AA44ktK	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Binary Search - Array?	This is the problem:      Create an integer array of size 100. Define function InitializeArray() to initialize the array with random values. Sort the array in ascending order. After sorting the array, you will ask the user to select one of the following functions to be performed on the   sorted array:   1. Find the average of all the values in the array.   2. Delete the median of the array (i.e. the (n/2)-th largest value in the array).   3. Ask the user to input an integer. Insert the integer into the array while   maintaining the ascending order.   4. Print all the values in the array.      I'm supposed to use "binary search" for this problem, but I'm a little unfamiliar with this method.

20090304111024AA6EAcY	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do I get my internet back to working right?	I connect to the internet by tethering my alltel phone to my computer using a USB cable.  My phone is fine, but I think there is a software issue or a registry issue.  Almost all of my downloads that i download from my firefox browser and Chrome browser, download like 1/4 of the file and then stop and they say that the downloads are finished.  I will be browsing the internet and after a variable amount of time, the browsers will show unable to display page and I have to restart the computer to get the browsers and anything that uses the internet to work right again.  I have Windows Vista,  I have Zonealarm firewall and i have disabled it to see if that was the issue, but it does not affect anything.  I have AVG antivirus and I do scans and there are no viruses, I have SUPERAntiSpyware as well and it does not detect any spyware.  So I think it has to be some kind of registry or software issue, But I really need help in fixing this issue.  I hope that someone here can help me out.

Some months ago, when working out a triboot, I accidentally deleted my recovery partition, and now I need to get it back. Without it, my warranty wont be any good, in case I ever need to return it to get my money back, or the computer fixed, and without it I wont be able to do a factory reset to restore my computer to the factory condition.    So my request is this...   Can somebody who owns a Dell Studio 1535, and still has their recovery partition please copy the recovery software files found on there, compress them into a .zip file, and send them to me?   I can be reached at the email of:   jakemanjoke@yahoo.com      My sincere appreciation and gratitude to the person who does this for me.      Thanks in advance!      JMJ

20090304121004AACiObT	Computers & Internet;Software	Is my program worth anything?	I've seen many shareware programs out there that are not even that useful, yet people still buy them..   Anyway, I've been working on a program recently. I started writing it just from boredom and for practice for my classes, but now I am thinking maybe some people will actually pay for it?   The program is basically an equation solver. You give it the equation and the unknown and it solves it. It can take input in two ways: 1) Just a simple string of the equation 2) An image file with the equation drawn in it (this one is of course not perfect but it works fine as long as the image is not all gnarled).    I haven't seen any other programs like that (except my TI-89 Ti which cost me over 100$). So I thought perhaps I can sell it as shareware for really cheap like 9$.

All the torrents on there will be legal, so I don't mind companies that like to poke their noses into what I'm transferring.       By low usage I mean likely under 200gigs/month, and I don't need blazing speeds, but 10mb/sec+ is really needed, but I don't need gigabit lines. 10gigs HDD space is probably OK.      Can I just use a web-hosting plan and install torrentflux/rtorrent/utorrent on there, or will that not be possible or allowed? What about VPS? What speeds can I get from there?      Lastly, what can I get for   Less than ￡5? (If anything)   ￡5-10   ￡10-20      Like I said, low cost is the most important factor!

I'm doing this project in comp sci called Serendipity Booksellers, and we display a menu and have the user select an option from that menu, as follows:      Serendipity Booksellers   Main Menu      1. Cashier Module   2. Inventory Database Module   3. Report Module   4. Exit      Enter Your Choice: 1      You selected item 1.      I am in the process of trying to integrate these now so when 1 is selected, it takes you to the cashier module.  I am working on cashier right now (it has its own separate menu, with option 1 being "Look Up A Book").  I created a stub function for this, as follows:      void lookUpBook(void)   {    cout << "Look up a Book." << endl;   } //end lookUpBook      When I compile everything, it says cout and endl are undeclared identifiers, and I have no clue what I'm doing wrong.  That is exactly how the stub is supposed to look right now, so I'm thinking the problem lies in my header.  This is what it looks like:      #include    #include    #include    #include       using namespace std;   #define SBS "Serendipity Booksellers"   #define Enter "Enter Your Choice:  "   #include "cashier.cpp"   #include "lookUpBook.cpp"   #include "invMenu.cpp"         What am I doing wrong???      By the way, lookUpBook.cpp matches the #include lookUpBook in my header spelling-wise, so that is not the problem.

I don't have the installation CD that came with it, but when I plug the USB into my computer, it'll work.      I recently hooked it up to keep in touch with my cousin that live in another state. We both have AIM and attempt to use the video chat through the AIM program.      It works for a few seconds and we both see each other, then it disconnects. It usually disconnects after a few seconds and continues to do that when we try to reconnect.      I've played with my firewalls, settings, etc. and it still disconnects. How can I fix this??

I'm familiar with the next_permutation algorithm, and have used it successfully (hooray for this c++ beginner!) with permutations not involving repeated elements.      Is there a way to use this algorithm to show permutations WITH repeats?  I have three integers and 11 "places" for them...I believe there are 3^11 permutations of these integers, allowing repeats.  (I hope that's correct...).        If you have any tips on c++ permutations allowing repeats, I'd love to hear them -- thanks so much!!

20090304133923AA3Ru7J	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Domino ALC or Noctua U12P SE1366?	Hello, i have recently been wondering what would be a better choice for my future I7 Rig.  my budget is a little tight because of the i7's immense price, but i think i could manage around $90 for cooling.  The price of the Noctua is $80 where as the Domino is 86.55 ish.  Therefore, which would provide me with a better cooling solution for an overclocked i7 920.         Oh and I've heard that the Domino ALC can get quite loud, so could someone tell me if replacing the fan would be viable or the least bit effective.

It won't boot in safe mood and I can't even boot from the recovery disk, it just goes back to the same screen.      Anyone got any ideas, it would be much appreciated!   Thanks in advance!

20090304135902AAc5VTL	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Internet connection trouble (not wireless)?	Here's the quickie: about a week ago, the internet began to act a little strange. It's always on, and I know when it disconnects because both computers have a display (which while I'm working on it, I watch very carefully). The computers are mine (Windows Vista), and a family computer, (WIndows XP), and I have checked and rechecked the connection to the router on both multiple times (reset it, even) and nothing seems to be working. The main problem seems to be that anything using lengthy internet connectivity (streaming videos, using an instant messaging program, downloading files, etc) does not work. It connects for a short time, maybe three or four minutes, and then stops for no apparent reason. Even small, 1 minute videos don't load beyond, say, 30%. However, the internet is still connected.      Does anyone have any ideas on what the problem is or how I might fix it?

Does anyone know how we can solve this problem ? It's not just one night or two but every time. Even when we just make a call it closes down on us.   People will say use Skype but she can't set it up as I set up the MSN for her when I was out there to make it as easy as possible for her as she is not very computer literate.

I have had a number of COMPUTERS through out the years (desktops and Laptops), from XP to currently Vista.      I notice i after a while, the more i install softwares/aplications etc. the slower my computer gets, and now most of the time, i have to go through a process of switching applications off or debugging, or virus checks etc., just so that i can use it for the day properly. Not only that, i have noticed my Sony Vaio laptop tends to get hotter and noisier because the fan is working a lot harder.

20090304140814AA4VStP	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Radar Graph in .NET or VB.NET?	I am creating a team-scouting system for our school's FIRST Robotics team, and the team captain asked me for the system to provide a radar or spider graph that rates teams. We have accomplished doing this in powerpoint and excel 2007, but we prefer to use an application that will run, connect to our mySQL database, etc. I was wondering how I would create an octagonal radar graph with VB code that will go into a "PictureBox" object. I was thinking 500 by 500 pixel bitmap and I'd have to look into the geometry before attempting this, but in essence, how do you manipulate images?         YES you must read the whole question through, otherwise you won't understand and will give an irrelevant answer. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it happens all of the time!

When I'm on my computer, online, and using Firefox to surf the net, my computer will occasionally make what I can only describe as "jungle noises".  It's definitely a sound file coming from some application through the speakers.  It lasts only a little over a second, and the sound is something like croaking frogs and crickets with some sort of jungle bird call at the end.  It's the most bizarre thing, and I can't figure out what's causing it.  The sound doesn't seem to be associated with any website in particular.  Even stranger, I've now had this happen on both my laptop running Win XP and on my iMac running OS X.  What the heck???

I sold a Playstation 3 to someone who payed by cheque, they recieved the PS3 but complained "the game CASE is cracked so what you gonna do about it?"      The case was pristine condition went sent so I had suspitions that she was dodgy. She then opened a paypal dispute and eventually I was given 5 options (one was a a ￡40 discount for the cracked case.. what a joke) I accepted the refund option where she has to send the item back and the funds where frozen until i recieved the item.      Today i opened the parcel which I saw the cracked case and saw a very little crack which i suspect she did herself BUT NO PS3 WAS IN THE BOX, a huge stone was wrapped up inside.      I called paypal who said they will email me a form that I need to fill and said i'm covered... I got a email saying:      In order to proceed with our investigation of your appeal, we request that   you report the damage, alteration, or missing parts regarding your returned   merchandise to your local law enforcement agency and supply PayPal with a   copy of the report.  Please fax the report to PayPal at 08707 303 196   within 10 days.  If we do not receive your fax within 10 days, your appeal   will be denied.  Please be certain to include your Case Number with your   fax.      After I do this what do you think will be my chances?? She could say she sent the PS3 and I put the stone there.

How could a company do this and not go into bancrupsy. they basically charge people late when they did pay on time and basically from what i have heard say it is IMPOSSIBLE to have them accept your check even on time because they just take that money and mark it as unpaid the next month which result in undeserved bad credit and eventually dept collector which are totally unnessarry when you ARE paying you bills. besides dell's tech support i thought dell was a great company. anyway i thought it was illegal to do such a thing.
20090304143403AAfgZmT	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Will you please help about SSH/Telnet?	Hello guys,       I could not come to answer of why/how about the following question.      What happens when the crypto key zeroize rsa command is entered on a switch configured with the transport input ssh command on the vty lines? (Choose one)      1.  A new RSA key pair is created.    2.  The switch defaults to allowing Telnet connections only.    3.  The switch is no longer able to make SSH connections as an SSH         client.    4.  The switch allows remote connections only after a new RSA key pair is generated.       I would appreciate your help      Thank you

It's a Dell (I'll give the specs in a min.) that's about 8 years old. It runs Windows XP, but super slow! I was going to try and put Linux Mint on it, but I was told it wouldn't help any.   Here are it's specs:   -1.8 Pentium 4 Processor (Not Dual Core!!)   -256MB RAM (ram CAN'T be upgraded!!)   -I think 64MB of memory on the Video Card (It's an 8y/o NVidia. Not too sure of it's model/make)   -80GB HDD (I'm pretty sure it's an IDE)      So other then the Hard Drive, nothing, I repeat "NOTHING" can be upgraded!!      So what distro of Linux would be best for this old PC? I've heard "PuppyLinux" would be good.      Also, I need to make sure that the distro would have all the necessary Drivers to work with this PC. (It's 8 years old.... I can guaranty that I won't be able to find any drivers online!! XD )      So... Linux anyone?

Virus?	1)While listening to music you hear a short sound (voice) saying something like "Oh my God go away" or "Oh my God no way". It appears at regular times but interval not fixed. I found that this was caused by destructed/damaged JAVA files.    Solution: REMOVE existing JAVA application via Windows Configuration and REINSTALL JAVA again. Afterwards the problem was SOLVED: I never heard the virus-voice/sound again.   You can install Java again from  http://java.com/       2)Additionally it is possible that you hear this voice/sound due to SMILEYS appearing somewhere in a window. However this kind of appearing the sound is not caused by damaged computerfiles.    Try to stay out of such windows with the mouse cursor.
