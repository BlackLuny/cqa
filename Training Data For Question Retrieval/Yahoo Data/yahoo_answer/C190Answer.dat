E2UXN7J1aa	Well most people would say that you are crazy, but you know your body better than anyone else. Personally I didn't feel baby until 17 weeks and it felt like popping to me. I never felt the whole butterfly thing people talk about it was just popping....like popcorn in my lower abdomen. Congrats and good luck. :)|`|ROJans2Taa	my first was around 20-21 weeks my second was around 17-18 weeks, im not sure if yours was baby, but if you know your body well and your convinced then im happy for you, it's an amazing feeling, theres nothing like it, best wishes|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	cute baby huh <br>  wiggle wiggle|`|9hrJfhIIaa	I'm further ahead than you, but I felt movement early on (12 weeks) - the only way I could describe it was that it felt like popcorn popping inside of me. <br>  <br>  Now that I'm almost 19 weeks (tomorrow!) I feel this all the time. Gas is a completely different sensation than fetal movement. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|BdE4GquHaa	i started feeling movements at 19 weeks (my first). Everyone feels their babies at different times so its possible yes! I though it felt like twitchy nerves in my tummy! Its such a great feeling when it first happens! congrats x|`|AztPvbauaa	doubt if it was the baby.I'm 39 weeks now but i first felt the baby around 18 weeks.depends if this is your first .they say first babies are usually felt a little later.this is my first.|`|ItklBKylaa	I felt mine at 10 weeks and other people could feel her move at 15 weeks!! Not even kidding!!! Yes I'd say you felt your baby!!! Exciting huh? I'm like you and am very aware of my body so don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Hope you have a great pregnancy, I sure have! my mom thought I was crazy until she felt the baby move for herself at 15 weeks.|`|25c6d5700e6137614608981bc5f7d45daa	OMG , ME TOO !<br>  lol - bt i felt them a little at 11 wks .<br>  & now at 13 wks i feel them OFTEN & dr said it ws baby .<br>  im very aware of my body as well & i know what gas feels like . & that is not what im feeling .<br>  congrats|`|mwnAsx0Eaa	I started feeling flutters when i was about 12 weeks so yes it probably is! lovely isn't it! try a little trick..lie down and very lightly tickly the bottom of ur belly like your pelvic area and u sould feel a butterly fluttery feeling!! :)|`|ALX19Md4aa	I think its to soon to feel your baby. I felt it sometime after 13weeks. But then again everyone is different|`|dR2bqUixaa	I started at 15 weeks, but now I can't feel anything. I don't know if it's normal, I hope so. Lol!|`|IRZ4czGPaa	yea well i felt my baby move that early too!!<br>  <br>  yayy i think it is your baby moving... it feels like tiny fish swimming in your tummy verry fast =)
O97ZoHGXaa	when it comes to exercise, the advice i got is if you were doing it before you were pregnant.. then you will be fine to exercise during.<br>  obviously there are certain things to avoid doing.<br>  someone i found that really helped to talk to was a personal trainer who specialized in pregnancy and post pregnancy fitness. they can give you lots of advice and do's and don'ts.  Pretty much every gym has one so pop down.  <br>  I'd say so long as when your running about you don't feel your self in any strain on Extreme tiredness you'll be fine!  make sure you get your rest later one though! x|`|ALX19Md4aa	At 16weeks I would say that's fine. As long as you watch out for your belly! Also ask your Dr he will know your body then anyone and can give you a much better answer.|`|UAXHmqgRaa	Your pregnant not dead. Of course you can run just as long as its not like a 10k! Lol. I have three kids, and babysit my nieces and nephews and all together i have seven at times and I watched all them pregnant and I ran after them.|`|tWFc9mTGaa	Its fine aslong as u don't feel any discomfort... exercise is very good in pregnancy! Good Luck xx
wWkfASTNaa	This month was my first month TTC that I seriously didnt feel any symptoms, which is kind of what prompted me to test. Once I got a positive, I did notice changes in my nipples (tmi) but nothin else really. I even had AF-like cramps. Normally I had sore boobs and mood swings and headaches-the works. This month, I felt better than normal LOL|`|vKEYa8aeaa	me! i had ZERO symptoms and i hadnt even missed my period yet lol|`|tQPvv0Glaa	When I got my positive on a home pregnancy test, I had no symptoms at all other than my period being a couple of days late.  Even 2 or 3 weeks later, I still didn't have any symptoms.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	we were trying for a baby so i was testing any way. saying that, i didn't have one single pregnancy symptom for the whole 40 weeks. apart from the obvious bump.<br>  I wouldn't go on symptoms alone to decide anything x
PLC8ZTe7aa	Of course I would! They're much hotter than white guys! ;-)<br>  <br>  -Meghan|`|J3H3C5ksaa	I personally don't give a sh^t.<br>  <br>  I'm not racist & I'm not shallow.|`|V1hxvQukaa	yes i do.<br>  <br>  yes i would.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	I don't think they are the hottest in the world, but some can be cute.|`|I64JOuMKaa	for sure!<br>  <br>  some indian guys are really cuuute :)!<br>  im not saying all of them are cute, but like always not all guys from every race is cute<br>  <br>  not all white guys are cute<br>  not all black guys are cute<br>  not all mexican guys are cute<br>  not all indian guys are cute<br>  <br>  but some of them are from each race ! race doesn't matter :) personality does!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It doesn't matter to me where he's from. Is he attentive, confident without being arrogant, flirtatious without being sleazy?<br>  I wouldn't say I am particularly drawn to any ethnicity.|`|AusPef8Yaa	That ethnicity doesn't appeal to me as much as other ethnicities. I prefer Asian people over other ones for some reason. Just attracted to them more :)|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	very attractive.. my husband is mexican i think some people are culture interested for the attraction to the people that is how i was|`|HcvqGMZraa	personally no.|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	If he's hot and cool.<br>  <br>  The guys from Bollywood look like gods|`|126fnjTraa	No.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Yes :)|`|aAm1Dhx9aa	;kjl;|`|rY397zkQaa	yes, but honestly not all of them|`|Osn1xpu6aa	yes :]|`|QDC5Q64Taa	a lot of them really aren't in my experience... but on the other hand, i know some that really are. it just depends, i think.<br>  <br>  but it has nothing to do with them being indian... just with them as a person. so were i not currently in a relationship that i never wanted to end, yes. i would. their personality would matter a lot too, though.
AA11616741	I'm not sure if it's true or not, I'm curious about that too. For the record, they didn't have IVF done to get their sextuplets like octomom did, they did IUI.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	That is a tabloid- not true at all.|`|T0pkW783aa	I don't believe it for a second.  I met Jon and Kate at the hospital where the 6 little ones were born (my daughter's baby was in the neonatal unit with their 6).  They are wonderful parents and very good together.  People who criticize them don't understand them.  I think the show is so successful because they are genuine and are very good parents and loving partners as well.  The media will write anything in order to sell their magazines.  They hurt people with false stories on a regular basis and are sued quite often because of it.  Don't believe everything you read.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Kate is pretty much a big B*tch to jon most the time, she treats him like he is 3 yrs old. It's really sad how bad it looks on tv, how degrading it is to jon but I doubt that its true. I think that in a sick way Jon likes to be dominated and loves her and the kids to death and wouldn't leave|`|7HzfgRmwaa	i think its false. But if true I'd definitely understand! She needs to treat him better. Especially if they are Christians and practice the Word. God doesn't say to be disrespectful and rude to your husband! Just the opposite. He works hard to support that large family. If he had to go elsewhere to find some respect so be it...... :)|`|UXoTCL98aa	It's fake<br>  STAR prints fake stuff all the time|`|2VJJPCMiaa	I think Kate is annoying and rude and mean to Jon.  If he did do this it's because she's cutting him up every chance she gets and is just downright ugly to him at times when she is "right".  I don't think he would, but you never know.  As for the money, HOW many houses have they bought?  HOW many trips have they taken?  HOW stupid can Kate's hair get with the passing of time?  Either way I STRONGLY feel that their kids are being exploited because they are making THAT much money on them.  I think she should be persecuted just as much as Octomom.  She had six babies implanted in her just like Octomom and they didn't have the resources needed either, ALREADY having two kids at home.  I also think Octomom should cash in too.  Actually, I want to have multiples like that so I can endorse my kid's innocence to the world and say, "hey kids!  It's ok to be selfish and not think to get anywhere you need to get in life!"<br>  <br>  EDIT:  IUI or IVF, either way 6 babies are conceived and put in the womb to take in a non-natural and non-conventional way.|`|oAcJPS98aa	In marriage or relationships there is a strong person and a not-so strong person.  Kate is a leader, Jon is a follower.  I have been married for 34 years.  I am sure that people who don't know me say, "Whoa, she is such a  witch!"  My husband acts like a 4-year old boy!  I should get a medal for tolerating a lot of his stuff.  But then, he too, should get a medal for putting up with me.  <br>  <br>  Kate shoulders much of the family responsibility.  She was the home person and he got to leave the home to go to work for the first 3 or 4 years of the sextuplets lives.  Talk about freedom!   How would you handle a set of twins who feel threatened by six little siblings?  Her house is immaculate.  It's just my husband and I and not one room in my house is immaculate.  Kate is organized with a capital "O".  <br>  <br>  There is an Indian saying, "Don't talk about someone until you have walked a mile in their moccasins."  <br>  <br>  The tabloids love to destroy people.  The best thing we can do is NOT buy the stupid rag!!!|`|LMITClMnaa	idk. i hope not! cuz i love the show. but jon doesn seem like the kind of person who would drink heavily or run away with other girls.|`|3hQDfdwYaa	idk hopefully its not|`|NTfIJa7zaa	I would leave her too! She is rude and disrespectful toward him!
98WKYtfwaa	No, it's not illegal. Your friend can't control being an aunty or not, if the girlfriend decides she's having that baby then she'll be an aunty no matter what. I have no idea why you'd want to be nasty to her, she's done nothing to upset you, act like you normally would around her or don't bother at all, she's only pregnant.|`|BdE4GquHaa	no its not illegal, and why would you be mean to her? thats a pretty bad attitude, my sister was pregnant and 14 and had her baby at 15 and my nephew is now nearly 12 years old. Its none of your business so if you can be nice then dont say anything. You sound really young aswel to be honest with an attitude like that. Get a real pregnancy question!!!|`|AztPvbauaa	i don't think you should be so focused on her pregnancy.And by the way No it's not illegal.Just try to mind your business and try not to also get pregnant at this age.Plus you don't have to be mean to her....|`|gmH1MPn1aa	what did she do to you to cause you to be mean. and no it is not illegal to be pregnant! ... what are they teaching you kids|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	This is exactly why young people should not even be able to concieve a child... <br>  <br>  OF COURSE IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO BE PREGNANT! At any age!|`|ql4EgAL3aa	You mean ILLEGAL. Well its illegal to have have sex under the age of consent depending on your age.|`|dR2bqUixaa	It's not illegal. Why would you want to act mean? That's just stupid.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	no|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You know, you should act nice to her.  It's not easy being pregnant, especially when you are soo young.  It is also not illegal to be pregnant, so don't worry about it.  You should treat her as you would want to be treated in that situation... would you want to be treated like a social outcast?|`|cyt7oh97aa	If she is pregnant then she has a lot more going on and you acting mean to her is the least of her problems.  It's not illegal, it's just irresponsible on her part.  If I were you I would be as helpful as possible and let your friend know that her sister needs support no matter how old she is.  If it really bothers you maybe you should talk to your school counselor and see what you can do to help her.|`|HVJCkuzfaa	Wow. Of course it isnt illegal! Strange question. And no you shouldnt be mean to her... she must already be under enough stress as it is to be having to take crap from anyone.|`|JjBSEaGoaa	its not illegal to be pregnant, but if u have sex under the age of 16, it is considered as rape, even if she said yes,,|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	no its not illegal! and why would you want to be mean to her u weirdo its really none of your business so if you cant be nice then just dont bother and leave her alone!|`|AFObCLvZaa	Its not illegal as long as your friend's brother is not over 18. If that was the case it would be labeled as illegal...|`|aaiPjDg0aa	It's NOT illegal. Just gross. Well, to be pregnant at a young age.|`|Vr9i1yRiaa	Yes, very much so and is punishable from 20 years to life.<br>  (You should start attending English class).|`|6db9f742a1916600f115b248eaa65ec2aa	no and be nice<br>  its hers business not yours|`|C6kvT88Saa	act like you normally would|`|TcO3QxV3aa	nope it is not "illegal" it is just wrong|`|DoKXlLL3aa	No it's not ILLEGAL. That just sucks for her.|`|JGj8TN2saa	it's not illegal|`|I2ZMRXNXaa	no it's not illegal|`|OLvNK5FOaa	no its not|`|CvGEdIUiaa	Honestly, grow up! Why would you be mean to her? She decided to have the baby at a very young age, and she needs every bit of support she can get. And yet, she chose to take responsibility and drastically change her live, and not just have an abortion. I think she did something not many people would do in her situation. And your friend had better grow up, too. Nobody asked her if she "wanted" to be an aunt, and frankly: If I were pregnant, I wouldn't care a fig about whether she wanted to be an aunt or not. That's like saying you'd have to ask your siblings if they were ok with you having s*x every time you wanted to do it.<br>  <br>  Besides: it is never illegal for a girl / woman who can, by biology, be a mother, to become a mother. It is illegal to rape people, it is illegal to have sex with people who can not give consent if those are several years younger than you are, but: being pregnant is never a crime.<br>  <br>  Switch your brain on. And be nice to her!|`|aVPZHmuHaa	I don't think it's illegal becuz' there are tons of underage pregnancies in teenage girls! When u see her act nice becuz she's probaly going through a rough time and she may need support.|`|hxi90NTIaa	It's probably not. But if she was in England, then she would probably be on the news|`|3TdT5mG2aa	No, it is not illegal to be pregnant at any age. <br>  <br>  You should act however you want to. People make mistakes and you will realize that once you mature. Just because she is pregnant doesn't mean she is a bad person.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you should be nice to her...why would you be mean? just because she is pregnant? that is the most ignorant and immature thing ive ever heard of. no it isnt ILLEGAL to be pregnant at 14...her having sex was illegal but not the pregnant part. how old is this guy she is pregnant by? he could be in some serious trouble =[. <br>  <br>  <br>  dont ever be mean or rude to girls just because they are pregant. you have no idea how badly it hurts to get mean looks just because you LOOK young and are pregnant.|`|TU7vDI95aa	It's not illegal, just stupid.  But no, don't be mean to her because of it.  Just act how you normally do with her (assuming you're not usually mean, that is).|`|tDeYQV6raa	it is not illegal.  it might be illegal for the guy to have had sex with her, depending on how old she is.  but it is never illegal to be pregnant.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	It is not illegal to be pregnant. This is a ridiculous question.<br>  <br>  And don't be mean to her....she is stressed out enough probably.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Stupid questions like this should be illegal.
hXinTq7Daa	When I babysit that happens to me sometimes. I find the best thing to do is tell them that mom and dad want them to get a good nights sleep and they will be home soon to see them, if they become difficult maybe sing them a lullaby or read them a story. If they get even more difficult then tell them its time to stop messing and go to sleep. This usually works for me. Good luck!|`|f5aa23cdbd4ef64eaad598ab21fef48caa	The fact that you understand that little children can be frightened and might come to you for comfort shows that you have maturity and maternal instincts.   If they come downstairs crying and frightened.  Let you maternal instincts take over and nurture them.  Hug them and let them know that everything is Ok.  If the boys have wet diapers,   change them, so that they will be dry and comfortable.   You are older and on your way to becoming a woman.  You will know what to do.|`|HSB3BMqcaa	play with them and make them forget their parent left<br>  or tell them a story not a scary one lol|`|gWlmU1KJaa	a bit of both:<br>  <br>  comfort them a while, then send them to bed|`|fNv2Re6baa	Give them a quick hug and reassure them that their parents will be home soon. Take them back up to bed yourself and lay them down. Pat or stroke their back gentally until they fall asleep. Then tip-toe back downstairs again. <br>  <br>  The other thing you can do is talk to their parents about it. Have their mother or father discuss the situation with the kids and have them promise the kids something special if they behave and get a good report from you. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
wWkfASTNaa	I would def wait till you are late to test. It saves money on HPT and saves you the possible disappointment of seeing the BFN before that big dinner you know? I would go and enjoy the night. As far as having a few drinks, I would try not to go overboard and get drunk, but you cant let your life revolve around if you could be pregnant or not or when you are ovulating, otherwise you will go crazy and it will take longer because you are stressing out over it all the time. What we did was take a month off and just have sex when we wanted to just for pleasure and not worry about doing all the crazy things like propping my hips up and laying there for 20 mins. ANd you know what? 2 days after my 21st birthday (yes we went out for drinks) I got my BFP! As hard as it is, dont stress and plan your life around TTC.|`|znW4b0Mfaa	I can totally relate to you on the stressing over baby #2.<br>  But trust me,stressing only makes things harder.<br>  My husband and I spent 2 years going thru fertility treatments with no luck.We stopped them 6 months ago,I am currently 8 weeks pregnant!!<br>  So it proves that stressing can hinder a lady getting pregnant.<br>  So try to relax and enjoy  yourself and good luck on the baby process.
XCX8w4LMaa	i don't really like ur girl name but its not that bad. <br>  but i do like riley for a girl or a boy.<br>  or kacie for a girl or a boy.<br>  just for a boy i like dylan.<br>  just for a girl i like arianna.<br>  hope this helps! =)|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I like it, but how about Mila Kaytlin, so the middle and first name don't clash because of length. You don't want two very short names put together, because then the flow isn't as great. But I do like the name :)|`|OHfZFR31aa	Is it MEE-la or MY-la?|`|N5EhfDX2aa	Mila Kate is quite nice. What about Myra Kate?<br>  <br>  Similar boy names are<br>  <br>  Mark Kayde<br>  Micah Kenneth<br>  Micah Kole <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK =]|`|URvhlHmeaa	well you had better choose some boys name hun because theres a 50/50 chance, & be grateful for whatever it is.|`|AOkucu5haa	It's cute.|`|SqNhZdbtaa	I like it, it sounds very girly|`|MW6WOTDIaa	Mila... i think i heard that in a book once. its very pretty.|`|o3OgDcfeaa	awwww its cute..i love it..|`|HutwI6Cfaa	i think Kaylynn is a good girls name what do u think?? or another way 2 spell it is Kaylin
0LKfIdS4aa	One, you spelled destructive wrong, and two, this is caused by long term bad parenting habits. You need to come down on them hard. I'm not talking about striking them, just them losing privileges, and very fast. They need to see that what they are doing is bad, and to stop. By taking away privileges, they will begin to see that breaking things means losing other things.|`|6db9f742a1916600f115b248eaa65ec2aa	they may be autist if they are destroying the house give them some safe toys and watch them. Also get them tested for autism and AdHd.|`|oQCPFiJMaa	Call the cops on them. That'll scare them into behaving.|`|6e5b848f7fef4c024d3e0ddc434039fbaa	Just whip their butts, sounds like you have some serious issues that need to be remedied quickly. If i ever tore up my moms house like that she would have gave me one hell of a whipping and that would have put an end to that and plus i would have been grounded for life probably.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Damn...behavior like this usually resaults from long term crap parenting. Learn to disapline and you won't get **** like this.
wWkfASTNaa	There is a good chance you could be pregnant. I have those cramps all the time, its really the only thing that I have going on that reminds me I am pregnant LOL. I would give it a few days, wait till your period should have shown to test, that way you are not dissapointed. <br>  As far as your temos go, they seem to be trending up, which mine did this month when I got my BFP, but without pre O temps to compare it to, those temps arent really helpful you know? You need to know what your temps would normally be like at this time to really make sense of those temps. This is why they say not to start temping in the middle of a cycle. GL and babydust!|`|AA10564328	you should take a test.your a couple of days before your period starts.all the symptoms sound like pregnancy.good luck
a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Don't be afraid to make a witty comeback. Stand up for yourself, hell girls need to learn to punch more often actually. These girls probably have never faced any hardship beyond breaking a nail and they won't learn or mature unless you give them a hardship.|`|FVPOxaeJaa	They are not your friends|`|mDBHMJPjaa	LYNCH THAT B*TCH :)|`|FiUprYsvaa	Drop the horrible friends and make new ones who like you for you.|`|Wtyk7086aa	no you are not being oversensitive. stand up for yourself girl.
cHrPyTokaa	I had a c-section in 2007 & that one took me about 5 weeks. And I had a c-section in 2008, and it only took me 2 weeks.|`|lGcpXteaaa	After the c-section i was in a lot of pain. I took to it a lot worse than other moms i knew, so an answer you get on here wont really determine your recovery but can give you some sort of insight.<br>  <br>  I think the 1st week was horrible for me, i couldnt walk upright, i was doubled over constantly. Then the 2nd week walking became a little easier and i was able to walk, and bend etc...<br>  The 3rd week was ok, except for the odd pains in the cut and sitting up, things like that but by the month had passed i was pretty much back to normal. If i didnt overdo it i was fine, your body will let you know how much is enough for you, dont go against your bodies signals. It results in pain!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	it says 6 to 8 weeks to recover . it took me like 4 weeks and i didnt have very much pain at all. i still have numbness around the scar|`|LPsogWKSaa	Hi there, I had a c-section 6 months ago and in all honesty it took me about 6 weeks not feel sore when i was standing up or moving around. I did overstretch myself though by going out and about too early. I still feel numb around the area where my scar is, I have been told it can stay like this for years! <br>  <br>  I think you also have to take into account if it is a planned c-section or an emergency section (mine was emergency) as I have a few friends who have had both and they felt they recovered quicker from the planned.<br>  <br>  It is a major operation, so you really have to try and take it easy for a while afterwards (easier said than done with a newborn!)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and best wishes if you are having or have had one x|`|B2Gki86uaa	3 weeks|`|7FlBTFajaa	2-3 weeks..i was physcailly recovered..but you know your not healed inside till ur like 6-8 weeks|`|znW4b0Mfaa	I had a big baby by section.<br>  She was 9 pounds and 9 ounces.<br>  It wasn't as bad as everyone told me it would be.<br>  I would say it took about 4-6 weeks till I was feeling really good.<br>  I was really sore for about 2 weeks,then I got better fairly quickly after that.I was feeling better day by day.|`|Ke454OIhaa	It took me 4 weeks for the pain to go away.  It sucks but you have to make sure to get up and start moving around within the next couple days.  My son is now 13 months old and it still itches every single day!|`|mpjHTE3Faa	I had a c-section and it took me like 2-3 weeks ... tops...i started working out like 2 times a week but onlu eliptical for 1/2 hour...
7HzfgRmwaa	No, it doesn't cause flu symptoms (I've had it twice while pregnant) However, the flue symptoms you are feeling could very well be because you are 7 weeks pregnant and you body is adjusting to that. I think they are just normal pregnancy symptoms. But definitely call your doc asap about the BV because it can cause a miscarriage if not treated. This is why I miscarried my first pregnancy. Good Luck. ***No, call the doc about the BV today and get them to order you some medicine**|`|vKEYa8aeaa	thats just pregnancy symptoms. BV doesnt give you any type of symptoms like that. get used to feeling like crap lol you will feel like that for your first trimester lol! your second will be great and in your third EVERYTHING will hurt! lol|`|98WKYtfwaa	I don't recall my bout of BV having any flu like symptoms, when i had BV i just had a fishy smelling discharge and that's all, but i suppose it's different for everyone.<br>  <br>  When i was early on in my pregnancy i had flu like symptoms, but that was just due to pregnancy. You might be coming in with the flu though.<br>  <br>  I would just wait until the 18th but it's upto you.|`|mwnAsx0Eaa	It could very well i only think this because after giving birth i found out that i had BV but during my pregnancy i had the flu about 3 times! so that might of been because i had BV and didn't know! so yes i think it could hope i helped!

AA11785285	You may decide you don't want any at all.  <br>  <br>  Kids are hard work, and those beautiful babies grow up to be teenagers, and that, hon, is for sure no fun... not for the parents or anyone else who has to deal with them.  Look at all the questions under Adolescence in this section.  Crazy, and very sad... ":I hate my mom... how can I stand to be in this house another 5 years????"  and similar questions...<br>  <br>  My mom always said, don't have children outside of a solid relationship, and even if you do, don't have any more than you yourself can support.." Your kids and your education are forever::::::Husbands, lovers and promises are not."<br>  <br>  Do you have that degree?  <br>  <br>  Do you have a solid job? <br>  <br>   And are you willing to step to the plate for 2 decades, (him as well) and provide a loving home in which to raise children who likely will grow up and not even like you.????????... <br>  <br>  google any of this.  (Most kids don't pay too much attention to their parents.  Is this what you wish to do with your life?   Because you won't be out from under them until you are 46 or so.... into middle age.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  And you will read all the answers from all these pregnat women who are sooooo ready to be parents.  Yup.  They all stay concerned even thru grade 6.  As soon as that kid is an 8th grader --- 13, they don't even show up to Back to School Night.  And the ones that do, are generally in the wrong room!!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	You aren't too young to have a child, but you may wish to be married first and have some time for just the two of you to establish a solid marriage before you try to conceive.  However, if both you and your boyfriend feel you are ready for a baby go ahead and start trying.  I got pregnant at 21, a year after being married, because I have severe endometriosis and cysts that may put a very short time limit on our fertility.  Good luck whenever you decide!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	We're 26 years old and having our first - this is after being together for 10 years and marrying this past summer. We waited until we bought a home and felt secure in our finances, and my body was telling me it was time. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|md66E0LWaa	in a stable relationship financially sable and comfortable in your life    one thing left to say   have yourself a baby|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I am 21 and pregnant with my first child. I will be 22 when he/she is born and I am fully ready for this baby|`|UAXHmqgRaa	Honey only you can decide that! I am 24 too, and I already have three children, and maybe another on the way! The economic situation is bad yes, but that shouldnt be a reason for you to hold back your life and put having babies on hold. Unless you and your husband was living in a homeless shelter and you didn't have jobs, but it sounds like you all are pretty stable! Go for it if thats what your dreaming of. The economy will get better eventually.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	What age you should be when you get pregnant is really a matter of opinion... Back in the day people had babies much earlier in life than they do now.. For instance, my grand parents had all 4 of their kids before they were 30, having their first one at age 21. You can't put an age limit on pregnancy because some people are in a position to be able to start a family sooner than others and some prefer to wait so that they can experience life before they have a child.. some just don't care<br>  <br>  I'm 21 & pregnant with my first baby and super excited about it.|`|IRZ4czGPaa	omg if you really want to be a mom go for it!<br>  im 19 and have a 3 month old..<br>  shes the best thing thats ever hapened to me..<br>  if you feel your ready and you want to get pregnant.. then right now is the right time!!!<br>  pregnancy is the most exiting journey ever.. and babies... omg they bring sooo much love its amazing.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	I'd say if you've traveled and spent amazing weekends alone with your hubby, go for it!  You sound financially stable, so no worries there!  If you feel you have lived your life and had the time to just be "you and hubby", then yes.....you're ready!|`|AztPvbauaa	im 23 and my baby is due on my birthday march 18th when i'd be turning 24.i'm fully ready.not married but in a stable relationship.so girl if you think you're ready just go ahead.|`|i1UN1Vxpaa	its really when ever you think you are ready and can handle it.<br>  <br>  start talking to your partner and see if he is ready. then make your call from there...|`|dR2bqUixaa	Whenever you think you are ready, as long as you aren't young. Lol!|`|1u2YmEJsaa	i am 20 n i am 9 weeks pregnant n me n my partner are extremely happy, as long as ur hapy n feel you could support a family then it could be the right time for you|`|kBCCwkA3aa	Well, when you say "stable relationship" do you mean married? Because if not, you shouldnt have a baby with someone you are not willing to marry.  <br>  <br>  But if you ar married, then you just have to go with your heart and see if your husband is feeling the same thing. <br>  <br>  I am 42 and very happily married, but dont have any kids, by choice:-) A lot of people think that is strange, but I just dont have a strong desire to have kids and neither does my husband. So, I think you just have to follow your heart and make sure that you are having a baby for the right reason.....because it is a desire in your hear that you just cant shake:-) Any other reason is not a good enough reason to have a baby.|`|ItklBKylaa	I was 19 almost 20 when I got pregnant! It was unplanned and if I had to do it over I would. Im 32 weeks and couldn't be happier. It's given my life a purpose. i'm going to college and I'm unmarried but in a great relationship with my babies daddy. There never is a right time but if you want a baby then go for it!  It's great!|`|TY2v2lkLaa	Well I had my first at 18, I'm now 21 ttc #2! If you feel like you want a child go for it! I would just say make sure your own physical health is in good shape! Why not have a baby if you don't desire a career focused life! No offense to working mom's I'm just a homemaker, I love watching my son grow and watching him sleep =D No love like your own children! An experience so amazing you cant explain!|`|khSCs1rbaa	I got married at 25, bought our home at 26 & then had our son at 28. You seem ready since you are in a stable relationship & also has house & some land<br>  <br>  Good luck & all the best
TsQumtCLaa	yes|`|N24wkFROaa	Yeah I use to go out with my friends when I was 11 (I'm 13 now)<br>  <br>  Just take your phone and it's all good :)|`|i7axq25Maa	Yes. My brothers 14 and he goes with his friends to the mall all the time.<br>  And make sure you have a cell phone in case of emergancy.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	yea as long as you are INSIDE the mall.<br>  i think i was 12 when i went to the mall with my friend. <br>  i still like going to the mall with my mom though (im 19) b/c then she pays for everything hahah~ <br>  what i love the most is when i go shopping by myself on like mondays when the mall is less crowded and I can just stay there for like 5 hours!<br>  as long as you are going with friends that are responsible and nice, im sure your parents wont have any problems.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	If the parents trust the girl and her friends.<br>  <br>  I was 14 when I first started going to the mall by myself/with friends.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Yes, I went to the mall with friends at like 11.|`|7B0qFbWBaa	im 13 and i sometimes go with my sister. it pretty much depends on how mature you are.|`|I64JOuMKaa	when I was in grade 5 was the first time I went to the mall alone with friends .<br>  <br>  I think you should be allowed since its a good area and you will be safe with all 4 of your friends<br>  <br>  you could tell your parents to pick you up/ drop you off at the mall? bring a cellphone?<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HFA05vDuaa	yeah i went alone when i was 11 or 12 (14 now. its fine just make sure she keeps her money safe and in deep pokets and if she doen't have a cell phone give her yours to use or make sure a friend has one in case of emergency!|`|DkT8znckaa	Yeah. I first went to the mall by myself without parents with two other friends when I was 12. Before then I went with parents and my friends.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I think so. <br>  My mom would drop me off at the mall with my friends at  that age with a cell phone.|`|0v7c0mY4aa	yeah i was allowed to catch the tram to a shopping centre with friends at that age & younger :)|`|mR9ydwz5aa	definitely.|`|0qGsS5hJaa	hfjkfhjjhfkjkf|`|3GhDbVVYaa	yeah i was allowed to go at 12 (summer going into 7th grade)|`|jV1Ma10jaa	yes. i didn;t start going to the mall without parenst until i was 13 either... i had a cell phone too. and the part of town sounds fine. i would let her go but just make her call you and tell you the plans for everything... like if they see a movie or something.|`|TwXJS1thaa	I am 13 and I think it is fine to go shopping with alot of friends alone. You should bring your cell phone thought. I like to have a parent at the mall just in case you need them but not following you around though.|`|hxi90NTIaa	What would you be doing at the mall at age 13? Walking around? Wasting money on clothes you will grow out of in a few years? If not then yea i think you should be able to go to the mall|`|DjFv7sYQaa	My mom used to drop us off and pick us up. There was no catching buses home or anything for safety. It is a scary world out there now. Also our time at the mall was limited, Like an hour or 2 at most.|`|lZ0LesZkaa	yea i think its ok i went to the mall a couple of weeks ago with two friends but technically my mom was there but was working but yeah i think its ok as long as your parents can call ou to make sure your ok|`|8dpZpH0Saa	Eh I dont know. I think 16 is a good age. They can drive and mature (sometimes). If you guys are mature then yeah I thinks its OK.|`|HcvqGMZraa	Im the same age and i think i should be able to but my dad thinks other wise.|`|TcO3QxV3aa	if she has a cell phone, atleast w/ two or three friends then i think it is fine.|`|lrjCsFGpaa	Yeah,I'm pretty sure it's okay.I do it all the time!|`|Wm40cZ0Uaa	why wouldn't your parents not let you go<br>  there is no prob.|`|4wRonK16aa	hell yea go =D that a great age to start going wit friends plus ur mom has a fone so thats good, so go fo it|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Yes as long as she isn't alone.|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	Yup<br>  Just pick her up|`|mDBHMJPjaa	YEAH!<br>  YOU THINK I CAN HAVE 10 PTS PLEASEE :)))|`|EWFtQNSdaa	yes, i've been allowed to since I was like 9 or 10.|`|sLLQ1Msraa	I guess, if you all have some form of communication with your parents. and have a scheadule mapped out(not like what store your going to at what time) but you know when your parrents should pick you up and where.<br>  <br>  When I was your age what my parents did was stay in the mall or somewhere around the mall-but not stalk me or anything just browse around and do their own thing, but will still be kind of close incase your in trouble|`|eY3hesxvaa	:)<br>  of course she should, the average age for a girl to go with only ONE other friend is eleven. Yes, it would be a different matter if it was in a rough area- but that sounds fine!<br>  <br>  She's a teenager, she needs freedom!|`|pDaz16t6aa	ya i do it all the time
0NwZPBgQaa	she could be pregnant....so she should test soon|`|AA11785285	About 100%.<br>  <br>  I read a note like this, and hon, I am so sorry for her and for you. You and the rest of our young people are the product of this country not teaching  the basics....for almost 8 years.....<br>  How Not to Get Pregnant.<br>  <br>  You and your mom obviously never had a talk, and her mom to her either, since you have written this... god, we in public education have sure let you down.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Sweetie, an erected penis is full of sperm, and preee cummm is full of it.... and it takes one swimmer. Sperm live up to 10 days in the vaginal area, and mother nature taught them which way to swim....., and eggs live up to five. And many women ovulate twice in one period. Do the math, hon. We are forever fertile.  The old "pull out and pray stuff" is all Africa has... and the average African girl has her first baby at age 13 or 14, with 13 more pregnancies, and 9 live births.  How very sad you don't know this<br>  <br>  Is he pregnant?  sure, and absolutely.  And she can get a test to prove it 6 weeks after her last pull out time with her bf.<br>  <br>  If a pregnancy isn't on her list this year, bc pills were free at planned parenthood, and they wouldn't even call her parents.  And abortion will cost in the area of $350.  Cheap compared to diapers for even a month.   And hon, no zygote, blastocyst is any baby... it is a clump of cells with no nervous system, can't hear, see, or feel anything.  The fundamental Christians have pushed this stuff on us for 8 years.  They can't even run their own lives but they want to run everyone else's.<br>  <br>  write if you have any questions|`|ee12f86390071e6ed1ca21eb76bf203faa	chances of it on the withdrawal methods are same as if he came inside her, she should take a test and if shes not advise her on using protection wat is it wit teenagers they think they can have sex but dont realise that it leads to babies if they dont use condoms or birth control.or wrose sexualy tranxmitted diesases|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	Sounds like shes right around ovulation, chances are probable. You most certainly can become pregnant from pre- *** and pulling out is certainly not a legitimate use of contraception, tell your friend...if shes having sex she should certainly be on birth control, and still ALWAYS use condoms|`|0AMfMRKHaa	I'm a doctor and she is pregnant her test will come 2 more weeks!
drI1vsJdaa	Tell Tom about it|`|N24wkFROaa	What?
52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I don't like either. I used to call my ex Armando because saying his name made me cry - true story.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick, I'd still go with Armando. Herman is just too..."Munsters" for me.|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Armando is more romantic.  Herman is a little...nerdier.<br>  <br>  I like Herman better anyway!|`|CxRJwJsraa	Armando.|`|6yD5k9Azaa	Armando :]|`|NI8D46J0aa	Don't particularly like either, but I think Armando is the better of the two.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	I've always liked Armando.|`|jY28SNtcaa	one that sounds white.|`|UhroMfoWaa	none! There are better options you know!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I guess it would have to be Armando.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i like Armando

E2UXN7J1aa	I don't think threatening her with her father was the best idea, but you didn't do anything wrong. There are a lot of anti spank people on here so you might hear some harsh things, but keep in mind not everyone thinks spanking is a terrible thing. You tried the time out method and obviously it didn't work. I think in this situation you did what had to be done. You aren't a bad parent. Don't be so hard on yourself.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	That sounds just about how I was disciplined at that age, and my siblings and I all turned out great.  Until recently (I'm 19) it never even occurred to me as a possibility to do things without my parents permission, and I only disobeyed on little things . . . like doing the chores.<br>  I never went partying or did anything illegal in high school, and I didn't (and still don't) talk back much.<br>  I don't have any emotional trauma and never thought it was "ok" to hit others (though my sister and I did fight with each other plenty.  That is just how sisters are, we never really hurt each other).<br>  <br>  They stopped spanking me around the time I was 7 or so.  I think I didn't need it any more . . . a threat was enough.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	No, you did the right thing, you tried time out and when that didnt work she got a spanking, and you used your husband as a threat because she was fighting back. She is only 5 a child and you handled the situation like a good parent would. Dont listen to people on here who say spanking is abuse and that there are other ways, and yes there are other ways and you used them first before you spanked. Your the parent and its your job to keep your child in line and if spanking is the way to do that then so be it. =) You sound like a very good mother.<br>  <br>  darcymc, well do you have kids? well when you do id like to see how you handle them after doing time outs and nothing works.<br>  <br>  <br>  and go ahead people give me thumbs down, spanking works, i rarly have to spank, i spank once and they dont think twice about doing it again. My children are very well behaved, unlike the little monsters i see runing around doing what they please because their parent say "oh spanking is abuse, ill never hit my child" and they wonder why their kids dont listen to them<br>  <br>  <br>  to all the kids on here answering, wait until you have kids of your own and then see how well you handle them when time outs dont work, what then just let them run around like wild animals, when you have kids come back and then say something, of course you guys think spanking is bad cause your still children and some going through that now, it hurts its upsetting and thats what it is suposed to do, if you dont want to get in trouble dont do the things you get in trouble for in the first place.<br>  <br>  <br>  what people on here need to understand is spanking dosent work for every child and neither dose time outs and such, disiplin is not a one size fits all kind of thing, and a lot of people dont understand that and I think thats why so many people get upset with parents that spank. <br>  <br>  when i was a kid time outs, grounding, ect... did not work but my dad spanked me a few times and I sure as hell never thought about doing it again, its something that worked for me, yea i didnt like it what kid in there right mind would, but they are not suposed to like it, and if disiplinig then right you wont have to do it that often =) Its not like its a daily thing, I got spanked a lot when i was little but as i got older and learned better it was once in a blue moon|`|AA10943329	You are a good parent because you followed through. Bad parents tel their kids there will be a consequence and never follow through.<br>  You did it in private, not in front of everyone and as you said she behaved herself after that. Next time you tell her she will get a smack she will listen and change the behaviour|`|XkWTsyJdaa	dont threaten w. spanking first of all. wat u were doing was right with the time out thing, but u shouldnt teach ur child punishment means pain. u shouldve taken one of her favorite toys away until she could earn it back and say sorry for wat she did. u hav to look her in the eye and tell her wat she did wrong and y u wont tolerate it.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	for gosh sakes, a little spanking never killed anyone..<br>  more parents should spank their little brats.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Yes! Don't use your husband as your weapon! That is not fair on him|`|OPjTfhqmaa	you shouldnt hit your children, my mum hit me once because i was crying and she wanted some peace. I was very unhappy because nobody was listening to me and i felt trapped. I was only 8 i think. Try to figure out what the problem is because im almost 16 and thinking about getting smacked still upsets me a bit.<br>  (no it wasnt abuse but it still traumatized me.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	Rebecca seems to have quite a fighting spirit, resisting you disciplining her even at 5 years of age! You handled the situation well, though. It was definitely necessary to give her a spanking, and to do it right then and there. If her dad's spanking are more of a threat to her than yours then there is nothing wrong with using that threat to make her comply. I hope that from now on she will know that mom means business too. You may have to repeat the lesson a couple of times though.<br>  And to answer your last question - you sound like a thoughtful and loving parent.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	no, for some reason they are more feared by the male figures in their lives, you did what you had to do and your not a mean mommy, if you ask your child to do something they should do it period|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't think the father should ever be used as a threat. <br>  It creates fear in the child of the one parent and the child never connects with that parent right.|`|KSK22vHUaa	You don't sound like a bad parent at all.  But for her to take you seriously in the future, you need to be able to command her attention without threat of her father.  <br>  <br>  You feeling guilty right now is probably what she is playing on.  You did the right thing as a parent.  Don't feel guilty about it and DEFINITELY don't show a child that young that you're questioning your actions.  She needs to see you as a solid authority, not an indecisive authority, to take you seriously.  <br>  <br>  Next time, pop her for telling you no the first time.  Do that a few times and she'll learn quicker.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	No, but next time you can bring out the choices/consequences earlier and avoid an ugly scene altogether (hopefully).  Try something like "Rebecca, pick up your jacket please."  "No."  "Rebecca, if you choose not to listen, then we will leave the playground.  Would you like to pick up your jacket, or are you ready to leave now?"<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide to do, don't let her know that it pisses you off when she disobeys you.  I struggle with that part!|`|faLD7RiVaa	To a degree, yes, you were wrong for using your husband to threaten your child. <br>  1. It really rather shows that your husband is the authority in the household and you lose a little respect when you take this route. Yes, it helps now and makes things a little easier but eventually you very well may have a screaming teen telling you that she does not have to listen to you, making those rebellious teen years ever so much more troublesome then they must be.<br>  2. You are in all reality making your husband the "bad guy", and to some degree instilling fear into your child.<br>  <br>  The bright side, if this is not your usual parenting technique, which I am assuming is not based upon the guilt you have for utilizing it, I am going to have to say, "No harm, no foul." We all get frustrated from time to time an alter from our usually parenting styles in haste. It does not make us "mean" or "bad" parents but humans. Don't fret, dear, everything should still be fine and her adoration and love towards you and her father most certainly should still be unwavering.|`|oQCPFiJMaa	It really Depends on what you were asking her to do. Three swats for misbehaving doesn't sound so terrible to me. Like a said though, it depends on what she was or wasn't doing. And the threat about the father didn't seem bad at all, that is the kind of thing that could scare her into behaving and teach her how to behave correctly if you don't intimidate her enough.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Hard to say. If she was say...2 years old then it would be better to just pick her up and keep her with you. If she was about 5 then it was alright. Depends on if she was old enough to even know what she was doing was bad.|`|0LKfIdS4aa	You sound like you got desperate, but made a reasonable choice. This way she knows that she shouldn't just listen to her father, but you too, because you disciplined her like your husband would.|`|mdO8Z0XTaa	no i wasn't wrong, you gave her a choice either you or your husband.<br>  and no, you don't sound like a bad mommy. Every parent disciplines their child.|`|12e9bda809a3a1ad8cdceb82b101d0c1aa	Yes mamm,you certainly did do the right thing,a spanking at a young age will teach respect for the future, i know i live in TEXAS in the ALAMO district and we have a 100% graduation rate with a 70% percent scholarships every year the best in the nation.and all teachers are required to carry a firearm to school and trained to use them.i have two boys two and nine and a daughter that has a scholarship at U.T.so yes you can rest easy,you did good|`|6e5b848f7fef4c024d3e0ddc434039fbaa	Hell no, you did a good job. If more parents did this there would be a lot better group of kids running around. No you did not do a bad thing in threatening to tell her dad. Your not a bad parent your a very good one don't let anybody tell you other wise. Your daughter will thank you one day, and you will have less problems with her down the road if you stick to disciplining her. She will have more respect for you and other people, and you will complimented from here on out as to how well behaved and mannered your children are.|`|8SOjngS0aa	I'm a teenager now, but my parents would spank me when I was little. I don't see anything wrong with it, it's disicpline, and it worked. As long as it's not out of anger, spanking is fine, it's a punishment. And putting her in a time out first was great also, as was moving along to a worse punishment when that didn't work. If you stay strict with it, she'll eventually learn that you mean it when you say you're going to punish her, and she'll obey you a little better. Don't worry, I was spanked as a kid, so if anyone would be against it it would be me, but I'm not. It's an effective punishment.|`|AA11831450	Sorry. I think the first spank was for her...and the other FOUR were for you. You must remember that you must never punish when you are frustrated. You should have simply packed up, kindly, but swiftly, packed up and gone home. Not for further punishment, but rather, a lesson. You talk mean to Mommy- we stop and go home. Don't threaten with Daddy. You take control of the issues that come up when you are watching her, and Daddy should deal with the ones that come up with him. Were you wanting to be the "nice one"? You will earn her respect and raise a well behaved child if she learns boundaries, and that there are consequenses. Your daughter was simply being 5 years old. She will test you, it is part of her learning process. Be dependable in your calm punishment. The 5 minute time out- without the lecture- would have been fine, then a pleasant, matter of fact, no threats,  trip home when she misbehaved again. The trip home being the punishment. Don't overdose her with discipline. Spanking should be last resort and only for certain circumstances. You don't teach a lesson by inflicting pain...you intimidate. You will also teach her to "strike out" when she is upset with others...maybe a child at shool. Hitting is not good, I don't care what you call it. Don't worry, Mommies mess up too and at least you are admitting that you may have done wrong. In my opinion it was more of a release for you to spank her 5 times. 3 for no, 2 for fighting?! Pick her up next time and get her home if she is not settling down. A 5 year old is controllable. For a child to learn from the punishment the child needs to understand it. If your daughter hurt you on purpose when she was struggling then a spank would be understandable, as long as it was not an out of control, mad spanking.  Remember, a slap on the butt or a slap in the face is still a slap.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	The fact is, would your husband have spanked her?  If he would have, then it wouldn't be a threat but a statement of fact.  More often than not the husband is the authority in a household, so it is not a fact that you sound like a bad parent.  I mean if you went and asked a question "How many people use to hear 'Just wait until your father gets home'" you will probably see it wasn't that bad to say that.  The truth of the manner is, if both you and your husband believe in spanking your kids, as I do, then you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  Just so you know when you get into an issue of spanking, a lot of people, mainly those who have never been spanked will say its abusive and how bad it is.  The key to it, is just to ignore them or else you will start feeling bad.|`|RTHWQvkzaa	I am in seventh grade, and my parents used to spank me when i was little. They do it to my younger sister when she is very bad. <br>  <br>  They say that hitting or spanking a child makes them understand that they should never do it again. But i disagree at times. Sometimes, it goes really far when my sister is not listening and my mom yells A LOT. If she tries to hurt my sister she usually fights back and I feel really bad for her. I personally dont think hurting your child is the right way to deal with it.<br>  <br>  I think you should use a different method. If you threaten that your husband will hurt her, and you never make him hurt her, eventually she might come to beleive that you don't mean it, and she won't take it seriously. Once or twice is okay.<br>  <br>  I think for punishments, you have to let her know that you are absolutely serious. Let he rknow exactly what will happen if she ever does it again. If eventually she learns and understands the consequences of such bad behaviors, she will stop doing them or probably stop by the second warning, at least.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful :-)|`|qsdifctkaa	An important thing to remember with acting out is that behaviour is communication, and she is not old enough to be intentionally misbehaving. Next time something like this happens, think about what has gone on in that day - a change in routine? Are you late in eating lunch? Was she anxious about anything? <br>  <br>  And, most importantly, a trick I've learned since being in daycare for 2 years (where we are NOT allowed to spank any kids! Yet they behave very well) is that whenever there is a break in the daily routine to something different, you tell the child earlier in the day what will happen, when it will be done, and what is expected - as well as what will happen if they do not behave as expected. <br>  <br>  Children have a hard time predicting the outcomes of new events. This is why they jump of the roof with a pillowcase for a parachute, et cetera. They often need a lot more explanation than we think they do.
G6TSzJ5oaa	it may be possible to be carrying twins and not no it. Yet it is very rare for the ultrasound technician not to have picked it up. It could be punching and kicking maybe. If you're concerned go to your dr and let him/her know whats going on and say that you are concerned maybe he will request another ultrasound to be done just to make sure|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's most likely he's  hitting the top of your stomach and kicking the bottom. They would not have missed twins in this day and age. Also twins run through the maternal genes, not the males, so any twins on your hubbies side doesn't effect your odds of having twins. Even with a genetic probability only 3 out of every 99 birth result in twin pregnancies.
wWkfASTNaa	I am not aware of anything that can force ovulation, aside from meds from the doctor. There are some over the counter teas and stuff that people swear by but I personally dont think any work. You could try to chart your BBT and see if you are or are not ovulating, and if you are not, go to a doctor to see what some options are.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I would think FDA approved medications would be safer than anything you could take otherwise. You would not want to end up further upsetting your fertility by taking something that is not tested.<br>  <br>  I want to note that I am all for natural methods, but in a case like this you might do more harm than good|`|znW4b0Mfaa	There is no way to "force ovulation".<br>  The only way to possibly bring it on is by fertility meds.<br>  And even that isn't guarenteed.
U5RObaBGaa	i was 17 when i got pregnant with my first, and its not easy, but you know that already as you said you have looked after your little sister. You seem to have faith in the fact that you will be a good mum babes so do what you think is best, if your happy to have a baby then have your baby, people have children a lot younger than you.<br>  <br>  As for do we think your disgusting to have a baby this young....NO we do not, its not always about your age it has a lot to do with your maturity, you will be fine, you sound as if you have a good head on your shoulders xxx|`|fk8Lz10Aaa	well you have 2 choices<br>  either you get rid or you keep it<br>  its your choice in the end tho|`|AA11785285	Yes, you are indeed too young.  And the chances of this guy staying with you past the kid's 18th month is absolutely nil   about 3%.<br>  <br>  Write if you have any questions.  I'm here another 20 minutes or so|`|85dfce96a83fdb7b5c93892243941847aa	Upon the fact that I'll feel sorry for the kid, I'll say you go for the abortion or....<br>  <br>  Yeah, adoption, give the kid to people who have more time to  and ability to take care of the kid, until you've graduated and gotten a job. Maybe from time to time you and your dude can go a visit the kid|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	17 is young. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Anyhow, what's done is done, you need to talk to somebody. PlannedParenthood or talk to your Doctor for more help.|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Keep the baby. U will be fine :) Good Luck with what you decie to do x|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	Well, you realize that your Mom will be disappointed in you so knowing that you need to brave it. Just be prepared for her to be angry and all. It is kind of like ripping off a bandage off a wound, just brace yourself and do it. <br>  <br>  The reason for this is that the sooner you tell your mom and family the sooner that they can help you figure things out.<br>  <br>  Also, you actually have more choices than you are pointing out. You could choose to murder your baby, you could keep it and try to muddle through even though you may not be mature enough now to really parent that child. The last thing you could do is give the baby up for adoption. Look, there are a lot of good families out there who would be delighted to adopt your baby and raise it as their own. So, don't be quick to discount that option.|`|D75rqaihaa	ok first, if your not trying for a baby, use protection!!!!!!<br>  <br>  but now its too late for that, so i suggest that you do tell your mum, remember she's been trhough this too, so she knows all about it, it sounds as if you will be supported, so if you feel you can take the task...go ahead...but remember babies are hard work...crazy converse person was right, you have your whole life ahead of you...but also abortion is murder...go onto youtube and type silent scream...then you'll see what you will be putting your child through...<br>  <br>  you could try, if you dont have support or are struggling....adoption...<br>  <br>  just next time...think before you act...unless your trying for a child<br>  <br>  good luck|`|LzJJn1m7aa	you are not to young to be pregnant at all and yes ppl will prob look down on u but i commend you if you keep the baby. Abortion puts you thru a lot of needless pain physical and emotional and does for the baby as well altho they lie and say it doesnt. They may be dissapointed but more ppl are let done if they find out you killed ur own baby ya know? dont worry you will be fine- the baby will love you and add something good to your life while an abortion would add sadness-sorrow and needless pain not to mention shame and gu8ilt. Youu can do it be strong you have a bf THAT will support you and you guys will have a great family! an abortion would effect him as well! my good guy friend was haunted by his gf's 4 abortions until the day he died=( its awful; dont go that route|`|h5cFkP35aa	i don't think it's disgusting at all to see a 17 year old with a child. i think it's disgusting when girls/women get pregnant, then have an abortion because they don't  want to be an adult and deal with their consequences. it may be hard at first, but you will make it. and i promise, it will all be worth it in the end without any regrets.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	Girl, I'm 16 and when I found out I was depressed for several days. But I immediately told my mother. She helped me to tell my dad. He was upset for a few days but got over it. My focus now is to pass school and make sure this baby is healthy.<br>  <br>  It is not disgusting to have a baby that young, just irresponsible. You can go through with it. It is difficult but that baby wants to live.|`|BGqhn5nIaa	don't get an abortion babe its just like killing a baby , <br>  yeah your parents will be disappointed with you at first but there let loose<br>  where not really in the position to tell you what you can and cant do its completely up to you <br>  your family wont be disgusted in you<br>  remember everybody loves a baby:)<br>  hope it all goes well<br>  x|`|9769d67187fb15ea712ad48623f59061aa	If you trust and love your mom tell her, expext a lot of yelling but<br>   let her calm down and she will hear to you.x<br>  <br>  Listen to her.xxxx and good luck.xxx|`|6XGYzWYbaa	many people have kept babies even younger than the age of 17 and turned out just fine. if u want the baby just go ahead and keep it and ur family will love you no matter what|`|NCcpjBL5aa	I can understand the comments that you are too young etc, i heard them all when i was pregnant at 16. However i made the decision to have my son and the baby's father and i worked to support our baby. It was a struggle, especially as my family dis-owned me for it, Which left me and my son completely on our own when my relationship ended. But, this is just my experience, you might very well have a much better one than me!<br>  <br>  One thing you shouldn't do.. Is take our word as gospel - you and your partner are the only ones that can decide whether or not you have your child. It is not an easy decision when so young, so please think about it - the last thing you'd want is to regret your decision for the rest of your life. x|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	Talk to your family first.  Your in a panic right now, you need some time to come to terms with this and your Mum and Dad will help you.  Yes, they might shout at first but after that they'll put you first and support you.  You don't have to give up everything for a baby, I still went to uni and qualified as a teacher as a single Mum with no parental support.  I thought about an abortion but I really didn't think it was right, and I hope you'll decide against it too.  Your boyfriend will help support you too.  Take care honey.  Don't worry.|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	17 Is very young to have a child,  becoming a mother for the first time is alot of work for anyone regardless of age, but you still have alot of maturing to do, I know some young mothers who have coped well and i know others who have fallen off the rail and the children are the ones who suffer. Only you know if you are ready, and if you are willing to sacrifice for your child. I became a mother at 20 (now 21) and for me it has helped me grow , i dont have much of a social life, i spend 90% of every waking moment with my 14 mnth old, i love her to pieces and id never take it back, but the father also promised me to help and right now hes off doing his own thing because he couldnt take the commitment and who suffers? my daughter who asks me where her dad is. whats done is done, i suggest you sit down with your parents and explain to them your situation, and together you can come to a solution, as mad as they may be, they are your family and they should love and support you regardless. Good luck|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Hey chick, its ok im 18 and pregnant!<br>  dont let people get you down who say your too young and not ready,<br>  nobody is prepared for a first child even if they have a house and plenty of money,<br>  im all against abortion so ive decided to keep the baby and me and my partner are has happy as can be and cant wait<br>  the choice is yours but make it your own not everybody else<br>  plus my friend had an abortion around 5 months ago and every day since then she has cried and she cried so much when she found out i was pregnant!<br>  good luck to you and make the best choice for you and your partner<br>  <3|`|1u2YmEJsaa	what i would do is confide in an adult, im not going to say u r too young because not being funny darling but u have not said anything about u using any protection.<br>  if you cant speak to ur mom maybe a sibling or family relative/close friend or ur gp. its not disgusting if you choose to keep your baby considering that their are kids out their having kids! i think u really need to speak to some one u feel comfortable with because if u do go through with an abortion it could be something u later regret and if u keep the baby u gota think of how u will support it. hope u make the right decision for you chick and not what u think other people will think of u, good luck xx|`|AA11220688	ok hun, calm down!<br>  the first thing to do is to tell your parents..i can understand how hard that is going to be (trust me, i've been there!). They may be angry but you need to understand their point-of-view on the situation, after all you are only 17! see what the outcome of that conversation is before you do anything hasty!!<br>  i believe that abortion is murder and you should consider all your other options before making that terrible decision!<br>  do you want to keep the baby? think about that!<br>  if you don't then why don't you consider putting the baby up for adoption? find the baby a decent family who are looking for a child!!<br>  <br>  this is not the end of the world my dear so don't fret..your boyfriend seems like a decent guy when he is telling you he will support you..have a talk with him before the two of you tell anybody. This is a decision only the two of you can make together!..good luck..x x|`|6XtR1i1vaa	you dont have to keep it and you dont have to have and abortion.  but youre forgetting one important choice...adoption.  there are plenty of couple out there that want a child but are unable to have their own.  Even if you dont want to raise your child, there sure are people that would be more than willing to do it for you.  please dont kill an innocent child so you can go on living your life the way it was. things have changed in your life. whether its good or bad is up to you...|`|4FFr21oWaa	Well hun it is your choice. though im a lot younger than you are and i just found out that i am too! And especially after you have some experience im sure you will do great, i dont have any at all! yes its gonna be pretty hard, but it all works out. Just think, its a gift, not something to get rid of! But if you get an abortion it is the most painful thing you will most likely ever go through, and im not talking about physically, im talking about emotionally. Either way good luck hun, Congrats! :)|`|HVJCkuzfaa	NO! Don't even THINK of abortion! That's horrible. Whats done is done and you need to be responsible for your own actions. That baby deserves a chance to live. I hope you make the right decision. Good Luck.|`|zbq1SoXgaa	Do not panic! Your family will never be disappointed.They are the best you have,have faith and talk with them.People(even your boy friend)may give up on you one day but not your family.Did they treat you right for 17 years?They have the right to hear and try to solve the matter.Everyone has his way on solving this matter,but you are not everyone.You are young even if not stupid you need to talk to someone who really LOVE you,and no one will love you more than your family.Believe me,talk to them now,and then you'll be sure what to do.Good luck.
2QvIM81Haa	Naw! It's for anybody who wants to shop there!<br>  <br>  I like to buy fuzzy socks there, they are adorable !<br>  <br>  If you are embarrassed to shop there, try Arden's, its a store made by Claire's and they sell pretty much the same things, but I think people consider it a little more "mature" than Claire's.. check it out?|`|N24wkFROaa	I'm 13 and I love Claire's, ok some of the stuff is childish yeah but so what, buy what you want :)|`|FGZR9RwDaa	yes i doo|`|YkD4Pf2Raa	im 15 and i still shop there. their jewellery is really nice, and not all of it looks childish, and its quite cheap. i don't see any reason to change where i shop just because some people think the jewellery is for 12 year olds.|`|z1xYF9tdaa	I'm 16, and I love going to claire's = ]|`|ejelObdJaa	freshman in high school and still go ther & my cousin is 20 almost 21 and still go there so it doesnt matter :) hahah :)|`|QQlbvWj4aa	I'm 18 and I don't generally go to Claire's because I find them expensive.<br>  <br>  But I work at a secondhand store and we frequently get their jewelry, and sometimes I buy it, they can be really cute, and usually in the unopened package!  I have a few pairs of earrings from there that I absolutely love.|`|HFA05vDuaa	well im 14 so im closer to 12 than you are lol but i like some of their things. . i don't like the hannah montana jo bro and high school musical stuff but they do have cool earings and bracelets. go for it! shop shop away and as far as they know you could be shopping for your 12 year old sister!|`|QcnzF6Lhaa	hahah yeah, im 16 and I still go to Claire's. I like their rings and some earrings and things. It doesn't matter that you shop there, it just depends on what you buy. Like, stay away from colorful fake hair pieces or candy lip gloss..lol. :D|`|I64JOuMKaa	haha<br>  some of their stuff is really childish<br>  like the hannah montana stuff<br>  but I buy that stuff<br>  <br>  I just buy there cute earrings and necklaces because some of them are really really cute :)<br>  <br>  our age doesn't matter don't worry ! :)<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I'm 18 and shop their occasionally. They have some cute stuff! :D <br>  The store is kinda preteenish, but who cares? Shop where ever you like.|`|ZAppRn5Faa	its not for 12 year olds its for everyoneee|`|FiUprYsvaa	Claire's is for anyone who likes their stuff.|`|Wtyk7086aa	nah. i still go there sometimes.|`|CEWIP3AHaa	Yeah, I love Claire's. When I was like 9-12 years old, I thought it was expensive, and only bought the stuff that was on sale. Now that I am a lot older, I realize that compared to other jewelry/accessory stores, Claire's is pretty well priced! And their stuff IS cute!<br>  Shop there if you want :) I love Claire's, it's awesome. Some of their stuff is designed for younger girls (i.e. the "Claire's Club" stuff) but most is for 13-16 year olds. Also, they have the Icing (by Claire's) stuff, at some locations, and some Claire's stores ONLY sell Icing stuff. The icing stuff is classier (i.e. less childish), more sophisticated, stylish and a little bit pricier, but it's worth it. Claire's is definitely NOT just for 12 year olds. Even my mom loves Claire's, haha. My friend's older sister (23 years old) is an intern at a personal stylist place (she makes outfits for people) and she uses a lot of Claire's jewelry for all her clients (Ages are usually between 16 and 45) and they all love it :)|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	Nope, I don't think so!<br>  <br>  I'm 13 and I shop in Claire's.<br>  <br>  Claire's suits a wide variety of ages. I see girls as young as 7 in Claire's, and sometimes I see grown women! Sure they have the Hannah Montana crap, but that's for the preteens! Not all of Claire's was made for them. Take body jewelry for example -why would they have body jewelry (like nose rings and all) for 12 year olds? Claire's is an awesome store.|`|HcvqGMZraa	im 13 almost 14 and i go there they have stuff for like anyone my mom even like it there but if you want something a little more mature then go to like Icing instead its pretty much the sam but more expensive but it really doesn't matter how old you are.|`|AusPef8Yaa	Who care's if its for 12 year olds? It all depends on what you like. They have a lot of childish things, but they have makeup. What 11 year old need eye shadow?

okUzIvMVaa	I was really embarrassed about my first period.  I wouldnt talk to my mom about anything that had to do with it until 2 years after i had gotten it.  Of course my mom made sure that i was properly taking care of things, (changing, keeping a diary, ect) but basicly i was all on my own, because it was a very personal thing to me, and i did not want to share it with my mother. You might take it offensively, but she is most likely embarrassed and wants to just handle it on her own. If she does, let her.  Your little girl is growing up, so sometimes you just need to give her the space she deserves.  And, if you still want to keep an eye on things, ask her if you could sometimes take a look at her diary of all the dates she got it and when it ended.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|trxEyVRLaa	I was embarrased when I started - and I never tell my mum when i've started or ended- though if she lives with you, which i assume she does, she will most likely have a similar cycle to you. And ofcourse she'll change her pad - she'll feel it's neccisary and if she doesn't it's not that bad - it's only bad not changing tampons as they could cause an infection - but pads are okay, just explain to her that it'll start to smell if she doens't change the pad atleast every 2 hours and she'll get self-concious and change it as often as she can,|`|B3cPFhssaa	She'll have to change it at some point when it gets to full,unless she fancies leaking which i suspect she doesn't.<br>  Also when she changes in the morning etc,she'll have to whether she wants to or not.<br>  Just give her some time as she has only just started,i'm sure she'll come round.|`|TXPGcExDaa	i was 13 almost 14 when i startted mine and i thought it was very awkward to talk to my mom about it even tho we're so close. one thing uu could do is let her use tampons which are so much better. or just let her handle it on her own. don't be worried she won't change the pad cause she will im sure. she prbly just said that cause she was trying to end the awkward situation..|`|v1xAKwJ4aa	if i were her i would be so embarrassed. i dont think 11 year olds get enough credit for how smart they are, i have a little sister, who's 11, and i remember when she had her period, she asked my fiance to take her shopping and such, my fiance told my mom, and my mom didnt tell my sister she knew. its just a really awkward thing for kids that age... hope this helps.<br>  <br>  -jc|`|YRcie6FBaa	wow lady back off <br>  its important to be supportive and let her know its ok <br>  but leave her alone. she doesnt have to talk to you about it, and she can take care of it herself<br>  i would flip if my mom was like that when i started<br>  its her business, not yours|`|HFA05vDuaa	give her breathing room!!!      i wouldn't want anyone keeping in a diary when i started and so on. . and don't worry. she"ll change her pad often enough shes probably just trying to get you off her back. giv eher time. . shes 11 after all!|`|DHDLVEaCaa	She willdo it in her own time. Let her come to terms with it. It is a really scary thing your first time. Ask her to put it in her own diary,so you are giving her, her own responsibility.|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	She's going to eventually change it. Let her do it on her own terms.<br>  <br>  Leave her alone. Your obviously making her uncomfortable.|`|AusPef8Yaa	This isn't really something that kids like to talk about with their parents.

I try to avoid the subject with my mom on less I Absolutely need something.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	don't ask her things about it, just remind her 3 times that she needs to change her pad often, other than that let her get on with it. she will probably feel embaressed talking about it with you|`|Q1EtcCb7aa	She's probably just embarassed.. i was really embarassed when i started mine. it's a big change and takes some getting used to. she'll come around.|`|4545cc681203d442768cb8efc651ac38aa	She'll know what to do. It's not rocket science. You got her the stuff she needs and showed her how to use it...she can take it from here.|`|aRCKguzDaa	just leave her alone. she probably knows what to do and doesnt want to talk about it. its perfectly normal.|`|DmLY2R5Gaa	shes just scared. i remember when i got my first period i was terrified. shes gona have to change that pad sometime soon<br>  <br>  and i was exactly like your daughter, i wouldnt tell my mum when i started and when i stopped, and i still dont always tell her. because shes at such a young age, i think you should do what i did when i got mine (although i was 14 when i got mine).<br>  <br>  on the calender put the initial of your first name then p<br>  so mine would be ep - stands for emmas period - but anyone else who is reading it wont have any clue what it means, and i bet they wont be looking every 4 weeks for it :P <br>  <br>  it might also help if you tell her when you start and stop - but do it suttle or she will get suspicious. <br>  <br>  goodluck :D hopefully i helped a little|`|wUMrDRe8aa	She'll know when to change it.<br>  Because she's just started, she's probably very light at the moment and can go about 2 days without changing.<br>  <br>  But maybe you should stop bugging her about telling her the start and finishing dates. If my mum did that to me I'd be pretty freaked. Just because she's started her period, she will feel REALLY depressed if you start acting different or look at her differently because of it.<br>  <br>  And she trusts you.<br>  I mean.. I didn't tell my mum I started my period for about 9 months! And I was 13!!! <br>  It's not that I wasn't close to her, just that I didn't want her to see me differently or get concerned about me.<br>  <br>  And also, who wants to look at their used pad? <br>  It makes me feel sick just the sight of them. <br>  Because I don't want to grow up.. She's probably just feeling this way too.. Maybe you should let her get to terms with it BEFORE you ask her starting and finishing dates. <br>  You should suggest she keeps a diary of that for herself, so she knows.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Lisa.Rr x|`|f3fc5a7d85e9dcdc560eaebaf497276caa	i understand, my daughters were embarresed to. i told them it was okay. <br>  i told them they didnt have to tell there father i was going to, and that its okay. tell her to keep a calender put a red dot every where she starts her period and ends it. My daughters have it behind there door in there room and it way much easlier because i understand how werid it is to talk to your mom about these things. obviously she will change it, put the pads in her bathroom. things will change, she will become more open with you. trust me.|`|f1U4UU3waa	Well i am 13<br>  and i started a couple of years ago.<br>  but when i started i didnt tell my mum<br>  and my mum wasnt as prepared as you were<br>  but<br>  i was glad for her just to find out.<br>  i got a bit embarresed<br>  but maybe you should have let her go by herself, maybe leave pads and things in her room...<br>  but now because she has started leave her pads in the bathroom and in her room<br>  and when she decides she needs to change, she'll change<br>  give her a little diary and let her mark things down and maybe when shes out look at the diary to see when she has started and stopped..<br>  basically what i say is leave her things and then leave her a note what each thing is for, im sure she will get used to it after a while :) x|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Not many people like the idea of their mom keeping track of their period. Maybe she can get a cute little journal or notebook to mark it in herself, then if she needs to know what day she had it and it ended for a medical or some other reason, she can take the book with her or just look in it and it's more personal. My mom used to try to mark all that on the calender in the kitchen, but she has a habbit of telling people what all the marks on her calendar mean (if they ask and oddly enough they do). Even though she promised she wouldn't, I didn't trust that at all. I kept it in a little calendar book type thingy. Of course she won't want to look at the pad, it's not a pretty sight, but maybe she would be willing to just go to the restroom and change it every couple of hours. Then she doesn't have to actually look at it, but just automatically change it. If she forgets to change it once, it will be a mess and I doubt she would do it again. Tell her that you don't need to know the dates everytime, but explain a little bit why she might (doctor appts). Then she's more responsible for her own stuff and maybe will feel more grown up, and in turn, feel better about herself and actually WANT to take care of all that by herself.|`|XkWTsyJdaa	im 14 and i got it when i was 12. its embarrassing especially if ur not supersuper close w. ur mom. or she mite just feel  weird about the whole puberty thing. if she doesnt want to talk about it, then dont push her to. im sure she knows wat she's doing. getting ur period is the start of being like a teenager, meaning more independence and stuff, so shell hav to learn to take care of herself|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	leave her alone!!!!<br>  i never wanted to tell my mom either. she locked me in the sun room with her and wouldn't let me out until i talked to her. let her deal with it herself. there are some things in life you don't need help with. someones being over protective.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	tell her itl come appx every 28 days so SHE should mark it down somewhere when shes due to come on as she doesnt want to start while shes in school and have it leak everywhere<br>  <br>  and shel change it <br>  shes just being a bit dramatic about it|`|FiUprYsvaa	I think she'll keep up with it. <br>  I just think she doesn't want to talk about it and doesn't want to let on about what she is doing.|`|UftgUcCIaa	Just tell her what she needs to do and back off. It's so humiliating on your first time. I was like shivering for 2 days. I was scared to death.|`|lV2a22gzaa	For the next month you already know when it started. The finish is immaterial. She will become ok with it, everyone does. Just keep an eye on her same time next month, have plenty of st's in supply for her and support her. She needs just basic info at this stage. Don't blind her with stories of pain and leaking pads. She is coming to terms at quite a young age to something very natural for the female body.|`|Wtyk7086aa	shes a little like me. when i got mine i completly broke down balling my eyes out and i didnt want to be near anyone. i waited 2 days before telling my mom. i went into depression, not even kidding you. yeah it was childish, i dont know why, i think i was depressed because i thought i wasnt normal. shes probably just embarrassed try to talk to her alone when no one is around, and just tell her that every girl goes through it.|`|P28wHaHbaa	dont get involved in what she wants to do, you went through a time like that and im sure you didnt want your mum telling you something your not intersted in, show her to some websites.. they should help and im sure people at school have learned about it, <br>  good luck x|`|5bd9782dc4224d26bbb20f86a3de9c05aa	I would leave her to it!<br>  She is growing up fast and needs to learn her way.<br>  She is probably very embarassed and needs to come to terms with all the changes.<br>  <br>  Give her some space and when she needs some advice i'm sure she will come to you.|`|I64JOuMKaa	when I started I was pretty embarassed and didn't want my mom bugging me about it<br>  <br>  just let her be, and tell her once that she's supposed to change it every 4-5 hours, so at least twice a day and leave her and let her learn :)|`|ovo9rOKgaa	ask her to mark it down in a dirayt.....you could by one just for that use<br>  then ask her to leave where you can look @ it so you make usure that she is ok|`|AA10529334	After shes a nasty mess a few times she will learn to change the pad.<br>  <br>  Just give her some time to adjust to this - its not easy.|`|DkT8znckaa	Just stay out of it. Unless your daughter has bad hygiene or has some mental disorder (not in a bad way, but girls with Autism and things may have a harder time with remembering this stuff) She should be fine. I started when I was 11 and didn't tell my mom for a week. I never tell my mom when I start or finish. I have good hygiene and change when I feel like I need to. If you've talked about it, she should know. Plus since you're all over her about it, that probably makes it more awkward. I would be weirded out if my mom wanted to keep track of my period for me. I don't even do that for myself. I'm sure your daughter is responsible enough to take care of these things by herself. Eventually she'll start feeling gross with the used pad on, and she'll change it. Just relax! I think lots of girls like to keep that more private than you are letting her.
E2UXN7J1aa	Your mother had her turn to name children. This is you and your wife's choice. If your mom gets upset then oh well...she will get over it.|`|p0prrzf2aa	who's kid is this? your MOMs??? NO! yours and your wife's kid. tell your mom to get over it. tell her to have her own kid and name it betty|`|2F5HNPqPaa	It's you and your wife's baby and therefore, you and your wife's choice.  Your mum got to choose your name... now you get to choose your daughters!  <br>  <br>  This is one big reason why it's better to keep names a secret from family in particular and then just announce it along with the birth of the baby!  That way it's too late for anyone to argue!|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	You left your mom's house a long time ago.

She has NO say!|`|5ujzs0k3aa	Congrats on the baby!!! It is your responsibility to tell your mom she had a say in giving you your name, now it is your turn to name your own child, tell her you appreciate her idea and opinions, but are going to go with whatever you and your wife choose.  Your mom is from a different time, names were different then so naturally she is not going to like something new and different. My son's name is Maddox. My mom hates the name, my husband and I love it. Plus, how rude is it of your mom to tell you what to name your child, and you should never suggest someone to name their child after you, family or not, that should be the parent's idea. How would your wife's mom feel about naming baby after your mom and not her?|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	Grow a spine and tell your mommy to butt out.  This is none of her business.  You are the parents and the ones who decide the name of the baby- not your mother.  It really will be better for your family (you, your wife and baby) if you put mommy in her place.  She really needs to grow up and stop acting like a bratty two year old who doesn't get her way.  She is not behaving like an adult.  <br>  <br>  Name the baby what you and your wife want to name it.  If mommy doesn't like it, then too bad.|`|MtOSX19Haa	Hello, it's not your mom's baby.  She doesn't have any say so in what you name your baby.  If you and your wife like that name go with it.  She got to name her child(ren).  Why does she want to deprive you and your wife of the privilege of naming yours?  Your mom may be upset and disappointed with you, but you have to live with your wife and your daughter.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	You and your wife should pick. If your mother wants to have another baby and name it Betty then tell her to go right ahead but this child is yours and you can name her whatever you and your wife like and agree on.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	its not your mothers baby its yours and your wifes! you have the say in what to name your child - choose something you both agree with! tell your mother to butt out..|`|hSJnaysiaa	I like payton best.

Grandma should just be happy to have a grandchild, regardless of what you name it. (i like Payton Grace... not that it helps the situation)|`|Kw3dO045aa	Everyone is wasting their time answering this guy. He titled his question "my wife had HER baby". . . his wife will name this child. <br>  <br>  And she should!  Because mothers carry the child, mothers have a different type of bond with the child. That bond will help aid her intuition in naming the child appropriately. <br>  <br>  A good wife will be willing to compromise, though.|`|qesCemuRaa	What it all comes down to is this is your baby not your mother's.

wWkfASTNaa	I would say that it is probably the flu. Diarrhea is not really a pregnancy symptom, and if they are really really bad cramps and you are PG, then that could be an ectopic or miscarriage. I would take a pregnancy test or go see a doctor, thats the only way to know for sure without more info.|`|FyEYarmqaa	i haven't heard of diarriah as a sign of pregnancy. I know there are a few cases of constipation. But you're best bet is to probably wait two weeks and take a pregnancy test. Until you have taken your test please be sure to eat healthy and act as you would if you were pregnant. Just because you don't know yet doesn't mean you should take care of the possiblilty of a baby. =) I know it doesn't really answer your question. But that's all I got. =)
p0prrzf2aa	i would listen to the doc. u/s are just gestation. most of them are right though|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Early ultrasounds are extremely accurate. See what your doctor thinks when he does his ultrasound.|`|h5cFkP35aa	Same thing happened to me except they said i was a week ahead but i KNOW when my LMP was. when calculating a date by an ultrasound they are only going by the measurements/size of the fetus. this could change a couple more times and most likely your baby won't be born on any of the due dates. just go by what you know happened and keep in mind, a baby is born on its own time.|`|wWkfASTNaa	If you know when you ovulated, that is far more accurate than LMP. My due date is different by a few days because I know when I ovulated. <a href="http://www.tubal-reversal.net/pregnancy-due-date.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tubal-reversal.net/pregnancy-...</a> is a good due date calculator and you can use LMP or o date :) Congrats!|`|jY28SNtcaa	Don't worry about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Go with your ultrasound dates. My due date doesn't match up AT ALL to my LMP dates - at least 3 weeks out. I've had 6 scans now and they've all been consistent with the same date. The 2 earliest scans were internal ones. I thought I was around 8 weeks, the scan showed 5 weeks. This was confirmed a couple of weeks later with another internal (showing me at 7 weeks when I thought I should have been 10). My 12 week dating scan was done based on these early scan dates as was my 20 week. they both backed up the internal scan dates. I had a growth scan at 28 weeks and a 3d done at 30 weeks, baby's measurements are bang on accurate for 28 and 30 weeks.

lkhCeAdJaa	Can I answer?  I am a 33 year old mom who had her first baby at 17 years old.<br>  Great...I'll answer then;<br>  <br>  1. No I was not using birth control.  It happened because we were alone and got carried away and were not prepared maturity-wise to handle the temptations and resist.<br>  <br>  2.I did not consider adoption because I couldn't imagine giving up my baby to someone else.  I didn't consider abortion because I couldn't imagine ending the life of my baby.<br>  <br>  3.I did get the proper pre-natal care but only starting late in my  pregnancy(6 months).<br>  <br>  4.What would have prevented me from becoming pregnant would have been better adult supervision.  I already had as much knowledge as I do now.  I already knew all about every birth control method available.  What I didn't posses is the maturity and self control that only comes with age.  I made irresponsible decisions due to my lack of maturity.  More parental supervision could have prevented me getting pregnant at such a young age (or at least made it much more unlikely to happen).|`|XkWTsyJdaa	im not pregnant, but my best friend's older sister got pregnant at 17  she was a senior. i pretty much know every answer cuz we talked about it alot, but not thaaat detailed.<br>  <br>  1. the one and only time she didnt use a condom cuz she JUST ended here period that morning and thought it was ok.<br>  2. she ended up getting an abortion. "black alley" abortion. idk wat that means rly, but im sure it means u dont need parental permission or anything and its pretty cheap to get done<br>  3. no. didnt tell her parents. lives in a jappy town where everyone knows eeverything about everyone so she could never tell her parents, or else shed be known as the skank throughout the town<br>  4. she said she shouldve gotten on the pill as a just-in-case, and she shouldve used a condom atleast.|`|faLD7RiVaa	1. I became pregnant on my 18th birthday while my fiance at the time was wearing a condom.<br>  2. About a month later (and one week after my bf dumped me) is when I discovered I was pregnant. I was in the Delayed Entry Program for the Air Force (I had my physical and everything the year previous) and was going in for a follow-up, make sure I was healthy, correct weight, not using drugs and not pregnant. Well, low and behold, to my surprise, I was pregnant. The recruiter told me the only way I would get in now was if I were to get married, give "it" up or (uggghhh, forgive me but this is what that horrible man stated) "dump it". For a split second I actually considered all of the above but in the end, none were the route I could live with.<br>  3. Yes, I most definately sought prenatal care.<br>  4. I'm sure there is, but would I have changed it? No, there isn't a day in my life w/my sons I would give up for anything.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Former teenage mom answering.<br>  <br>  1.  When you conceived, did you use birth control?  <br>  <br>  Yes.  Condom and the pill.  I guess we were the 0.1%.<br>  <br>  2. Did I consider adoption or abortion.<br>  <br>  While adoption briefly crossed my mind, I would never have an abortion.  <br>  <br>  3. Did I seek proper prenatal care?<br>  <br>  Of course.  Immediately.<br>  <br>  4. Any knowledge that would have prevented me from becoming pregnant?<br>  <br>  I don't think so.  We used two forms of birth control and we used them correctly.  I always took the pill correctly.  I realize that this was a very unusual situation, but it's what happened to us.  My son is a teenager now and I assure you that this subject has come up along with "the talks".<br>  <br>  And no, I don't regret it.  It was hard.  I married my son's father when he was about a year old and we're coming up on our 15th anniversary.  But my son was one of the best things that ever happened to me.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	1) No. We got caught up in the moment and never used a condom. It happens and we know it was our fault.<br>  <br>  2) Nope. Neither crossed my mind. I was to panicked to think.<br>  <br>  3) I did indeed. I made sure of that, and then my mom double checked.<br>  <br>  4) Apart from someone knocking at the door and saying don't forget to wear a condom, no.<br>  I knew what happen from having unprotected sex. <br>  <br>  I was a teenage mom|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	I am a former teen mum so I'll answer :)<br>  <br>  1. I had been using birth control but irresponsibly missed a couple of pills. <br>  <br>  2. I didn't consider either. I wanted to have my baby and I felt very hurt when everyone insisted I consider those options. <br>  <br>  3. I certainly did!|`|jwGkGaiCaa	I can't say for myself but I can say for my nephews mother who I've talked to about it many times (she was 14 at conception, father was 16) <br>  <br>  1.  She was using both the pill and condoms, I don't know if she was using them properly though <br>  <br>  2. She considered both but had the thought that her and my brother could have a nice happy family together and kept him (we're all glad she did now)<br>  <br>  3. She had all the proper care and dr visits <br>  <br>  4. I don't think there was much that could have helped her, save maybe not having sex at all|`|lN0GkKgaaa	1. No I was not using birth control. My friend raped me, that's how it happened.<br>  <br>  2. I considered adoption but just before my third trimester I changed my mind and decided to keep my baby. <br>  <br>  3. Yes I had proper prenatal care.<br>  <br>  4. No. It wasn't anything that I could have prevented unfortunately. She was conceived under bad circumstances yes, but she is my whole world. And I don't think I would have been able to handle everything if I didn't end up pregnant from what happened. She's what made me stronger. <br>  <br>  <br>  You're welcome.|`|KlWWh3fgaa	1) No, I wasn't. We were using protection though. <br>  <br>  2) No. It was up to me to be there for my child. It's up to me to not screw with them. It was up to me to protect and love, raise and guide them to best of my ability, which is pretty good if I admit.  I'm pro choice, but I wouldn't consider an abortion, because I was too young myself when I got pregnant. Back then I didn't understand the detail in an abortion, so my mom made that decision for me. <br>  <br>  3) Of course. I had to in all honesty. I was 15, and I didn't know anything about what I should eat, what I should avoid, and weather my baby was healthy or even there ! I had two positives, and 3 false-negatives when I tested myself. It's ridiculous if your pregnant and don't go to check ups. <br>  <br>  4) Your right, I don't regret it. Sure it wasn't the most convenient time for her to arrive, but I wouldn't change anything now. If I could go back though, I would like the knowledge of telling her father how to put a condom on properly !! I knew everything else ... just didn't put it into practice that night !|`|peQGGFPYaa	1. It was the first time we had ever had sex, we used a condom, but it broke. <br>  2. i considered letting my aunt and uncle adopt my baby since they had multiple miscarriages, but i couldn't do it. and i felt that if i was responsible enough to have sex then i should take the responsibility of the baby i had made. Abortion was never an option<br>  3. Made an appointment with the ob/gyn the day after i found out and told my parents.<br>  4. No, nothing would have prevented it. we thought we were as smart as you could be about that. we waited a year into our relationship to have sex unlike alot of other people we knew, and we thought we were careful by using a condom.

xvey8ixPaa	Mine started humming at age 3 months (No one believed me until I let them hear her over the phone...) and still does it while doing many things. She is now 20. I think it is a sign of higher intelligence!|`|FiUprYsvaa	My brother and I did when we were little but not loudly. <br>  She'll grow out of it. <br>  She is just discovering her voice.|`|D1dUFm6xaa	I have a 3 year old and she still does it sometimes. Watching tv even... Reading is not something that comes natural to them so that may be her way of "seeing" the words on the page or the pictures and colors. I have 3 kids total and they all did something so called "weird" in one way or another. If it makes her happy, then I would not worry about it.... You must be doing something right for her to be so content.|`|JCuowqG4aa	Well, everyone does that.<br>  Humming when looking through a magazine or book is normal, just like humming when your walking around outside is normal too!<br>  <br>  My baby neice does that too, only maybe when shes playing with ther toys or something.<br>  Maybe she does that when shes thinking cuz it helps her concentrate :D We all have our different methods, dont we!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	She's just developing speech.  She may be the kind of person that thinks out loud, and humming is her way of doing that.  She might enjoy it if you read the words out loud to her as you point to them.  Could even be an early reader.

There's no RULE you have to be ready right now.  Just let things happen when you are ready.|`|CszmaQ8Taa	no your not childish I think you need to wait I think I think not taking your clothes off is more mature that other teens|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Ew <br>  Just wait until your married :)|`|hTieELhTaa	no your not childish!! Thats why so many people do it in the dark! Haha no I was jk. But it could be possible. You should deff wait untill you are comfortable with the whole aspect of it. I was young and at one point in time and I was able to do it asa teenager only when I was drunk or high. fantastic isnt it? ugh.. I regret doing it so yound and 5the older I got the more I relized it and would only do it after being with the guy for a long time and when I was ready and comfortable. good for you for waiting and not jumping on the wagon that so many teens do.|`|28QPS6V9aa	No you're not childish. You're smart! I was the same way when I was your age and I was still like that even after I got married. Eventually I got comfortable enough with my husband that I didn't care if he saw me naked but let me tell ya, it took time! I'm still like that to an extent though. The only person I will let see me naked is my husband, I can't stand it when I have to get undressed at the doctors office.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	That is a good thing! Don't do anything you aren't comfortable with! You are only 16 and teens do it because the media makes them think it's the right thing to do when in reality 16 year olds sleeping around is disgusting and shows no self respect.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	First all all u don't have to take your clothes off to have sex, you have to take off your knickers,thongs, pants which ever you call it.<br>  <br>  && No, your not childish.|`|HFA05vDuaa	im like this. . . i don't want someone i love seeing me naked because if theve never seen a girl naked they might think its groos or not know something. . or idk but i get your point of veiw|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	Childish? No<br>  Insecure? Yes<br>  <br>  But just wait if you aren't comfortable.|`|UgX3gUSJaa	Its good taht u dont want to, because u are way to young anyways.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	hehe my husband has barely seen me many time without a shirt!! <br>  we've been together 3 years|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	No, I don't see how that is childish at all. You are 16 and at 16 you are still a child (until 18). Many people feel embarrassed to take their clothes off in front of people. If it embarrasses you, that's completely fine and acceptable. Don't do it then.<br>  <br>  It's also a good idea to stay away from sex at your age. While many 16 year olds feel that it is okay, it really isn't. There could be many consquences to "doing it" (as a teen). You could end up getting pregnant, or getting an STD. I don't see how people have sex either, and I'm a teen. I plan to stay a virgin until I am married and I think you should do the same if you are unsure.|`|AusPef8Yaa	I feel the same way. Except I'm 13 and shouldn't be taking her clothes off anyway! I don't, though ;)<br>  Just wait until you are comfortable with the right person and when you're older.|`|xKtdWzXlaa	Don't do it if you're not ready PERIOD!|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	You shouldn't have sex when your 16.<br>  The End.|`|2RzCfC1Qaa	Join a strip club you will learn!<br>  <br>  <br>  .

yB5go5wbaa	I'd probably tip you more cause I'd find that pretty kick *** that you could deal with drunk people while having a baby bump :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Why wouldn't someone tip a pregnant bartender? It wouldn't effect me giving a tip or not. You can work up until labor as long as your doctor doesn't tell you otherwise.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Um..yes, of course! Are you working in a bar where you have to be a "stereotypically hot bartender"? Even then your clientele should tip you the same as always :) Pregnancy is beautiful! <br>  <br>  I'm a server and am 8 months pregnant and am just starting up on the bar now. I'm making the same amount as I always have. Sometimes people are even a little more generous :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	why not? if the bar is smoke free and i never saw you drink i would just assume that you are like every other pregnant woman who works... you are trying to make a living and there is nothing wrong with that. i would probably pull you aside and give you a tip and something for the little one.. just cause i think its cute!|`|F0kjf1j8aa	you need to take time for yourself and baby if you feel exhausted or you are doing to much, your body will tell you when, don't over due anything when your pregnant, as for your tips you should get them based on how well you serve your customers, it shouldn't matter whats in your belly|`|1Du4Rudvaa	I would tip.  You should be able to work until you go into labor unless the doctors tell you otherwise.  You shouldn't need to cut back your hours unless you want to.|`|519pFNWpaa	Absolutely!  I worked as a cocktail waitress with a friend until she was 8 months pregnant.  You get bigger tips, too!  She was a workaholic too, and you can exercise as long as you feel you are energized to do so, as you can work.  Just don't let your work get the best of you, the food service industry is very exhausting...so keep up with those prenatal vitamins :) Good luck!|`|hTieELhTaa	I had a friend that worked at a bar almost right up till her due date. she was a bartender also but it was a smokey bar. She wore cute stuff that showed her belly and I know she made great tips. especially from her regulars.

But I don't tip any bartenders, so no I wouldn't tip a pregnant one. Then again, I don't go to bars either. :)|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Since your work progam is very low volume at times you coukd probably go untill your near ready to pop.

Ka52nbhNaa	My twins just started solids a few weeks ago - we started with just rice cereal at night . . . now we are working our way through vegetables.  We do one veggie at night with a bit of rice cereal for 4 nights in a row to be sure that they are not allergic.  Once we get through the veggies, we will be adding fruit at a separate feeding.<br>  <br>  Here is our current schedule:<br>  6:AM - Bottle<br>  10:AM - Bottle<br>  Noon - will eventually be veggie or fruit / right now it is nothing<br>  2:PM - Bottle<br>  5:30PM - Bottle<br>  7:30PM - Veggie and rice cereal<br>  8:30PM - Bottle and off to bed<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	At 5 1/2 months eating is just practice. If the baby wants to eat more, let them. If they refuse that's fine, they don't need solids yet. At 5 1/2 month just worry about the right amount of formula and let your child guide you to how much solids they want.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	If you're just starting, go with 1 tablespoon of baby rice cereal mixed with breastmilk or formula.  Maybe at around 11am after a milk feed...<br>  <br>  When that's going well, you can introduce vegetable or fruit purees... you can make these yourself or buy them in jars.  Maybe give fruit/veg puree at around 4pm as well as the cereal for breakfast.  <br>  <br>  My 6 month old has fruity cereal at 11am then dinner (vegetables) at 5pm.  He also sometimes has snacks in between (rusks or rice cakes) but he's been on solids since just before 5 months now and is becoming a pro!|`|Z8NwmAFlaa	i was very confused when i started introducing solids to my baby so i figured i would answer this question. To all the people that told u not to introduce solids until 6 months...we started our daugher on rice cereal at 4 months of age and she is perfectly fine(now almost 14 months). anyways, i would nurse my daugher, then wait about an hour or so and feed her some rice cereal (just a couple spoonfuls at first). she ended up tolerating oatmeal better. after about a month of just doing the cereal i believe we started doing some veggies too around dinner time. Our dr. said to start out with veggies as opposed to fruit because once they get a taste for the sweet stuff they won't like the veggies...this is what we did, however, i don't think it would have mattered either way she liked everything. so to give u a brief schedule from what i can remember..nursed her in the morning waited an hour..did some cereal, nursed again, nap, nursed...veggies around dinner and then another nursing  or two before she went to bed. prob another nap in there somewhere haha.can't remember exactly how many times she was eating at that time..sorry..but it was somethign along those lines..i think around 7 or 8 months we started doing 3 meals a day..each person does it different. oh- and u can start mixing the cereal with fruit after too! they like that:) hopefully this was more helpful than confusing..like i said it's been a couple months so can't remember exact details, but go with what your baby is telling you|`|08GDBedGaa	<a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/solidfood4to6montholdbaby.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/solidfo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/babymenu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/babymen...</a><br>  <br>  this site is my bible since introducing solids to my 6 1/2 month old daughter, she's been on solids for a month, she has 5-6 breastfeeds and ceral with a spoonful of fruit for breakfast <br>  veg and fruit fot lunch and veg for dinner, has a breastfeed 30 mins before solids!!|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	5 1/2 month olds don't need any solids just breastmilk or formula...You shouldn't even introduce solids until 6 months of age and that is just to get them used to it. Babies don't "need" solids for quite awhile.
b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Not every person carries the father's name but it is tradition so the majority of babies do get the father's name. <br>  <br>  Since more women are having babies out of wedlock and they still have their maiden name the babies are receiving the mother's last name more and more. <br>  <br>  Some married women choose to keep their maiden name and their children may carry their husband's name or they may hyphenate it. <br>  <br>  You can actually give a completely different last name to your child if you choose to but it doesn't make much sense to do that. It just depends on what the mother and father choose to give the child but it is usually the father's last name.|`|AA10529334	Nope you can give your child any last name you want them to have. Most ppl do give the children the fathers last name but it is not a law that you "have" to.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No not every child has to take the father's name.|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	No the mother orders the birth certificate and puts whatever the heck name she chooses.|`|hTieELhTaa	no if your not married alot of women choose to keep their own last name for their baby. I think I might keep my last name also if I was not married. to me if the father of my baby is not willing to step up and be with me forever or If I had made a mistake and dont want to be with him forever I would deff want to keep my own last name for my baby. But its tottaly your choice on what you want to do. It might make it easier to get child support if it has its dads last name but not nessecary i dont think|`|LPsogWKSaa	They don't have to, but I think it's mostly because of tradition and in past times most new parents were married. My OH and I aren't married so baby has both of our surnames (double barrel) it worked for us and if we do ever get married that is how I will have my surname and any future children too.|`|knWxRkDTaa	We just hyphenated my sons.|`|p0prrzf2aa	no, they don't HAVE to.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	No... though I suppose traditionally the woman would take her husbands name and therefore it's only logical the child would have the father's name too.  Nowadays it's not uncommon for a couple to both keep their own names e.g. Bill Johnson & Linda Smith... then the kids may be double barreled e.g. Barney Johnson-Smith

gdCqKl89aa	I would suggest finding out what is causing the allergy - or is it is a cold. My OB-GYN okayed menthol drops when I was preggo...all in moderation. Try a humidifier with eucalyptus drops in the water...your ears hurt due to drainage not draining...hold your nose and blow gently to force your tubes to open. Hang in there, rest a lot, and it will pass. You do not want to take tylenol even...there are side effects to everything, you must choose wisely (sometimes subtracting factors is easier and safer than adding medications and more factors)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Here's a helpful chart for safe medications:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_chart-over-the-counter-medications-during-pregnancy_1486462.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_chart-over-t...</a>

It also depends on the product your hairdresser uses too. I would be asking where you get your hair dyed if their products are safe for pregnant women.

AA10529334	Its only legal once you go in front of a judge and make it legal. Yes, you can do that - custody, child support, insurance for the children, visitations all can be worked out ahead of time and then submitted to the court with no lawyer.

0nXUva20aa	Use backup contraception.  Most antibiotics negate the pill's effectiveness, and you can get pregnant.

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	I would say the cake is the most important part.  So, have a cake made or do it yourself and decorate it w/ pink or blue or yellow (or green).  Then have punch or water avaliable.  Which you can make cheaply...probably $25 dollars or less.  Then I'd suggest making your own veggie tray (left overs are great and you can use for your dinner or lunch next day!).  Then small finger sandwhiches cut into 4s.  This are nice light food.<br>  <br>  As for games...you could do mixed up word games for baby stuff...example...yabb  spells baby.  Or ttoble spells bottle.  Your gusts should like that one.  I've also played the baby diaper game.  Usually somone buys you a huge pack of new born diapers and you take 5 of them and put in different candy bars then your guests guess which is which.  Also, did the baby food guessing...didn't enjoy as much as we had to taste all the baby food!  LOL but, it was fun to talk about.  You could research facts like "how many diapers do you go through 1 year" or "1 year total cost of baby" ect and have your guests guess the answers.  If you have a close net of people you could always have everyone share a story or share advice about their baby.  Up to you.  <br>  <br>  I like the previous posters idea of asking others to bring in a dish.  If I was asked I'd have no problem bringing a dish and a gift.  I would suggest making the main dish your self and providing the cake and punch.  Others can bring the rest which will add plenty to it.  After all you'll be doing more talking than eating when it comes to a baby shower!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  ADD-- Just wanted to respond to Mustangs_ comment.  Yes, a friend should help you throw one.  I'd ask friends if they could help (do stuff even if they don't want to/can't spend money).  However, it's also commonly said "every baby deservies to be showered".  If none of your friends are willing to help I'd throw my own too.  What's wrong w/ hosting your own party (because no one can/wants to help).  It would be sad to miss this showering experence b/c everyone needs to be welcomed and celebrated into the world.  No way am I missing mine so go ahead and celebrate...although it'd be nice if a friend would help.  Maybe they're waiting for you to ask.  Good luck!|`|hSJnaysiaa	There is no one else who can throw you a shower at all? <br>  <br>  Its considered bad etiquette to throw your own baby shower. Usually a friend or something throws you one.<br>  <br>  If no one threw me one I just wouldn't have one, better than looking tacky by throwing my own, but if you insist you can get decorations at the dollar store and just do snack-y foods.|`|Qk4LdFCvaa	well i know a couple of good games:<br>  <br>  1. Give people paper and have them draw a picture with there eyes of what the baby will look like.<br>  <br>  2. If you have the name already have them list words with only letters for the baby's name.<br>  <br>  3. Have them make a bingo chart and write the items that they think you will get and as you open the gifts if they have that item on their paper they mark it off. And who ever gets bingo first wins. And THEIR gift is a free spot.<br>  <br>  4. You can have people guess the size of the baby.<br>  <br>  5.As people arrive you can give them a a necklace. Through out the whole party people cant say baby or the name of the baby. An if they do a some one caches them they have to give the person who catches them the necklace. and who ever has the most at the end wins.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  ask people to bring food maybe<br>  or you can sandwiches and/or chicken for Albertsons<br>  <br>  Ok im gonna tell you go to the 99 cents stores they have alot of things it will help you trust me!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Ask several of your closest friends/family that will be attending to bring something for eating. Make sure you have more than only desserts though! Games...well one that I've played at 2 baby showers now is "Guess the candy bar". You melt each candy bar separately (only slightly though, enough to be mashed) and put it into a diaper. Put numbers on the diapers (usually 1-10) and the idea is to smell and look at it to guess what type of candy bar it is. Haha, but it looks like baby poop cuz its in diapers. Other ones can just be print offs from the internet :). Good Luck! If your house is big enough, have it there. Then you dont have to transport all the gifts!|`|a1uoxczTaa	ask people to bring food, everyone i know love making something from home and bringing it!|`|Rb72xgv3aa	CONGRATS ON THE BABY! Okay, Well, you definetly want to have it at home or at a park, hold a pot lock kind of food situation, so that you dont blow your money on that. You can buy party bads and twist ties (pink or blue) and write a thankyou for the gift  card  and give it to each person after they leave. I dont think you will need to worry about games too much, it will mostly be you talking about your little one to come, and things like that, but for an ice breaker activity you can have everyone sit next to a new person that they havent met, and get out a single playing card. Put the playing card to your lips, and suck in. Take your hands away. It should stay there. Now, without using your hands, have the person to your left kiss you through the card, suck it, and take the card. Then this person will continue till it gets back to you. Once everyone has done it without hands, you've won. Thats a bit crazy, but if you arent that kind of family, then you could always just stick with a board game of some sort. If the party gets awkward, ask if anyone wants a beer. hahah.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	You can have the baby shower at your house and ask some of your family members to bring dishes..Baked chicken,Mac n Cheese<br>  Games like you can go to baby r' us and they have cute pick and play games..For the winning items it can be like hmm maybe like cash(Maybe not since your on a tight budget) but fun stuff goody bags and stuff like that
Xrwvu5Uraa	ummm you take a pregnancy test and find out...you need to wait until you miss your period or test a couple days before you are expecting a period. your best bet will go to a doctor.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The only way to know for sure is to test. You can test 14 days after sex. Usually anything before that will not be accurate.|`|2kCC9JlSaa	well there is a really big chance of you being pregnant.  I mean if you didn't use a condom and you had sex twice, just wait.  It's still too early.  If you don't get your period take a test.|`|wWkfASTNaa	Its called a pregnancy test. Either store bought or at the doctors. The only way to really find out.|`|G7H745OJaa	yeah she's right buy a pregnancy test if not go to doctors.or prego cravings there are LOTS of signs of pregnancy.|`|jY28SNtcaa	Really, how do you remember to breath?

TY2v2lkLaa	ok dont listen to that broad, there is nothing wrong with a having a kid at 20 or younger, i had my first at 18. second of all, look at babycenter.com they will be able to show you a lot. They have an ovulation calendar that is helpful. It could take healthy couples up to 12 months to get pregnant no matter what age. My first was planned at 18, and it only took 3 weeks to get pregnant! Im 21 ttc #2 and I have been trying for 6 months! So it just varies. Its really good you dont smoke or drink so if you do get pregnant, your baby will be healthy.|`|we9sS2tNaa	your cervical mucus, usually if your wet it usually means your ovulating. Some women get a pain on either side kinda by where your ovaries would be and that means an egg is dropping. If you have a normal 28 day cycle you should ovulate around the 14th day of your cycle like 2 weeks before your period or 2 weeks after but everyone is different...just relax and it will happen|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	i was going to tell you the best way to concieve is not to try, because stress is a large contributor. However if you are under twenty i urge you to really think about what your doing. coming from a young mother to another, children are blessings, just be sure you are ready and givve that child all the love in the world, they need it. be rational..please|`|zNSDHpV6aa	you all way ovulating 14 day After  your period go off<br>  <br>  like this your period is march 10 your ovulating date is march 23 or 24|`|NShMySwBaa	Hi, a healthy couple can take up to a year to get pregnant at your age. You have about a 25% chance every month if everything is working correctly. Instead of following ovulation via bbt or opks you can just baby dance every other day! Relax and don't stress over it and I am sure it will happen sooner then expected. Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!!!|`|oHNrktxTaa	You can start by taking prenatal vitamins or a multivitamin that contains Folic Acid. <br>  I would stay away from alcohol and smoke.<br>  The best time to TTC is during your fertile week, which is prior to ovulation. The Clear Blue Easy Digital OPK sticks would help you to determine your LH surge rigt before you ovulate. Depending on the length of your cycle, you would begin using the sticks first thing in the morning till you get a positive. When you get your positive, it is telling you the best time to conceive is between 24-48 hours.<br>  It will help maximize your chances. <br>  The use of a menstrual calendar is helpful too.<br>  <br>  I would also prop a pillow beneath you & hold your legs up for 20 minutes.

SlBsJ3NRaa	No. It's fairly easy for any healthy woman to get pregnant between the ages of 13 or 14 (first periods) until the age 29. Once you hit the 30 mark, fertility starts to decrease.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. If it was there would not be so many pregnant teens.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	No, about the same considering your reproductive system is working properly and your partners little soldiers are in shape =)|`|3R12SXmAaa	no, actually younger people are more fertile than older women. the younger you are, the more fertile you are after you've had a period. hope that this helps you.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	Define harder?|`|YP3rEESUaa	actually no its about the same if not easier.|`|wWkfASTNaa	Actually the older you get, the harder it gets.

hGIi4mKlaa	Have a talk with them privately. Don't start shouting cause they will just think your immature. Best to prepare yourself BEFORE the talk. Maybe right down what you think their going to say ( i assume you know your parents well after 16 years? ) and right down strong and mature arguments against it. Don't make it sound like your sick of your little sister , make is sound like your sick of babysitting her because parents do get offended easily when it comes to their children. <br>  Hope it helps :D|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Tell them you wont watch her anymore, you may have to stay home but you dont have to pay any attention to her, refuse the money. It is there child not yours and you should not be responsible for her.|`|HY8hU6Nyaa	Let them know how stressed you are and how not being able to just relax and socialize is starting to affect you very negatively. Ask them how they would have felt at your age if they were never allowed out and offer to call the babysitters yourself. <br>  <br>  It might not be that they're "too lazy". Why don't you ask them straight up why they always make you stay in? I think the way for all of this to work effectively is if you say it all very calmly and politely. No matter what they might say, getting angry and into a fight will get you nowhere :S<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|PHzyDoKuaa	just tell them on monday after school that you are doing something with your friends friday night.<br>  <br>  you are a kid this is your time to have fun, just tell them you will watch her every other friday or tell them to do what they want on another night.<br>  your only a kid once.<br>  besides i was watching myself at 10.|`|ZWUXacATaa	She is old enough to take care of herself i have been staying home since I was 8 years old!!

Let them know that you only have that one day a week to do things with your friends and that you would really appreciate some time to just take it easy.  Maybe if you explained your position on things, and compromise (i.e. willing to baby sit every other weekend or whatever) you can come up with a schedule that would work great for both of you.  Just being open and honest about your feelings and communicating with your parents can really go a long way.  Just remember to stay calm and state your concerns clearly =)|`|ZKV5AnY6aa	i understand your situation. though i dont really have to babysit my sister on friday nights, i am 16 and i do have an 11 year old sister so i can understand where youre coming from. i as well am very busy after school so for me to have to babysit on my only night off, would piss me off too.  the only thing i can think of is that if theyre not willing to find another babysitter, find one yourself.  and really lay down the law with them. tell them that although you are the kid, you are 16 and you have a life that does not always evolve around them and your sister.  tell them that you are in high school and that you should be able to enjoy yourself and have fun and hang out with your friends once in a while, and ask them if they remember what high school was like for them, and if they would have wanted to spend their free time babysitting their sister.
NAzAmFDnaa	I've got my son on 2tbs of organic rice cereal for dinner.  He's 6mon and also breastfed.  My doctor said solid foods are really only for socialization and tounge training and not to use them as a nutritional replacement for breastmilk.  I might start veggies and fruits next month.  Nurse him first, then offer the solids.  I think the variety and textures of the foods are more important than the frequency.  You can nurse as long as you want, you just want to make sure the baby isn't adverse to new textures and tastes when you wean to table foods.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Hey Addie!  Not too sure that really works, but I have read in books if you have sex a few days before your ovulation is due it will be a girl and if you have sex right on your ovulation it will be a boy.<br>  <br>  It's down to the xx chromosome moves slower but lives longer (girl spermie) and the xy chromosome moves faster but dies quicker. ( boy spermie)  That's why if you have sex a few days before ovulation it's usually the girl sperm that makes it vs the boy.|`|ggGiHrnhaa	you on top of hubby, thrust hard, and come first.

AA10529334	If they kick you out and you go live with your boyfriend they are still responsible for you. However most police departments do not make a 17 year old go home - if you are ok and all that - but your parents could ask them to check on you as a "possible juvenile in distress" so be aware they could show up.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your parents do kick you out -- see if you can get them to write you a statement that you are not allowed to live at home and have permission to live at the boyfriends house. That is a legal agreement then.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	in my state if your parents kick you out at 18 and you walk off the property they can say you ran away you cant legally leave till your 18|`|FiUprYsvaa	They legally can't kick you out at 17. <br>  If they do you have all rights to stay somewhere else.|`|XkWTsyJdaa	i dont think they can do anything, but just to make sure, dont get kicked out till may 28th! lol|`|vAAGriFkaa	I suggest u think about it.<br>  what will happen if you break up with your boyfriend 2 weeks after u go live with him?<br>  besides, why should your parents kick you out? maybe u did something really bad and u are misbehaving? can't understand too much, need to know more details - relationship with your parents - how&why? how long u been with your boyfriend?<br>  <br>  also, you are in a rebellious age. just think really good about what you are about to do.|`|d5vDjb3Baa	As long as you are 18, they can't do anything.

If he is over the age of 18 it would be considered harboring a run away since your still technically under the age 18 and not an adult yet.  That only applies if your parents report you as a runaway, but from what you said it sounds like they want you out of their house so they probably won't report you.  Please keep yourself safe!  Good Luck xoxo|`|sxecXFgraa	Is he in the military?  And if he is, does he live on post?  If he does, he could get in trouble from the military for having you live with him without being married.

UqLbDHBraa	When I was 12 I hit 4'11". When I hit 14-ish I was still the same height. All of my family (on both sides) are either average height or really tall. One day I got sick and had to see the doctor. (The height was not the issue) The doc was slightly worried so she had me get some x-rays of joints to calculate how tall I should get. If I was supposed to get taller they were going to put me on medication to stop me from getting my period all together so I could grow like I was supposed to. Turned out I had already reached the height I was going to be. I never had much of any curves at all until I hit about 20 my hips have only gotten about an inch wider and my boobs grew slightly. I'm nearly 23 now and weigh 105lbs and never grew anymore.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are really concerned you should talk to the doctor and ask about possibly having the same x-rays done. (or something of that nature anyway.) It would probably clear up any worries and if there is a problem it can be solved.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	some of us mature later than others. i was straight up and down till i was a senior in high school and then suddenly grew "bumps". i was very surprised but i wouldnt worry about your daughter since you say she doesnt have any problems. :0)|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Her growth is based on the family genetics.

Xrwvu5Uraa	well every woman is different...since you are very pettite you could possibly show a little earlier then some woman but maybe not. you can probably expect a little belly around week 13-15 to start.|`|256cVXsmaa	I'm small built and I started showing around 14 weeks but it was more like a bloated pregnant belly.  Most girls get bloated bellys that make them look a little bit more pudgy and it also makes it hard to fit in your jeans.  Once the bloated stage passes your stomach might go down for a few days or so and then you will start showing a baby belly.  I started showing around 16 weeks but once I hit 20 weeks there was no hiding it anymore.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	I think being short and small you will start showing soon. I'm 5'1 (but a lot heavier than you) and whilst knew my belly was getting hard I didn't really show properly till around 6 months. I had more fat to hide it!<br>  I think you'll also look bigger when your bump starts showing, again simply because you're short. I'm 33 weeks with #2 and my bump is massive - according to everyone I meet. It just looks that way because its protruding from a small frame!|`|3R12SXmAaa	well im gonna say at about six weeks you should be showing because thats about the time that the uterus starts to rise out of the pelvis. Hope that this helps.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	it doesn't matter how small you are or how big you are.<br>  <br>  it all has to do with your insides and the way you're built.<br>  <br>  i'm small and started showing at 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  it varies from person to person.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Your uterus is still below your pelvic bone and doesn't "jump" over it until around 13 weeks so you may start to show around 14 weeks but it may take longer.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	I'm rather petit too and with my first pregnancy I didn't start showing until I was about 18 weeks!

Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy! :)|`|wWkfASTNaa	Most people dont start showing at all until 16 weeks or more, but some notice the difference in themselves sooner rather than later.

NCcpjBL5aa	I have no idea if you are pregnant or not, i just wanted to say that after i had my implant out, i didnt get pregnant until on the 10th month. Im not sure about it making you sterile, but it CAN affect your fertility afterwards.. Only in the short-term. <br>  <br>  good luck huni xx|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Fertility comes back as soon as the implant is removed. The bleeding does stop as it did for me after i had implanon taken out. <br>  It would be too soon to tell if you were pregnant but i don't think having one week without bleeding would be a sign that you are pregnant.<br>  Take a test to be sure, it is the only way.
lNgOUQsyaa	Ok so this is the formula my doctor gave me when I first started taking depo...for every year I was on it it would take me six months for me to conceive when I stopped taking it...and he was pretty correct about that I was on it for 4 years and it took 2 years for my menstrual and ovulation cycle to return to normal, so I hope that helps|`|GomqF0bfaa	You actually legally cannot move out until you are 18 which is the age of being able to give consent and is called the age of majority, even in Texas. The ONLY other states that have a different age is Nebraska(19), Alabama(19), & Mississippi(21). The only way you could be emancipated is if YOU enlisted in the millitary or you got married with your parents permission. You also aren't covered by your fiance's benifits unless you are married as well.<br>  <br>  Just know what you are getting yourself into.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Im not going to say anything about your age **YOUR BODY YOUR LIFE** I don't agree with it but im just going to answer your question you don't need a lecture<br>  <br>  I was on the depo shot and I started to ttc about 4 months after coming off.  It took us 15 months!  Every women is different and it could take you shorter or longer.............you won't know until you try.  Your baby won't be affected by previously being on the depo shot.|`|yB5go5wbaa	so what are you asking? if you go off of birth control, can you get pregnant? the answer is yes, you can.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	If you are planning becoming a parent around cheerleading and band - you aren't old enough.<br>  <br>  My sister had a baby at 17 - she thought she was ready too - she "tried."  She learned very quickly that finishing high school with a newborn is not the easy life that you think it will be and she had no other life besides the baby.  Then she began to resent her daughter for "taking her teenage years, prom, etc." away.  Her daughter is now 18, and lives with me.  THe love that was going to last a lifetime - guess what - it didn't last past the child's birth - then 8 years after she was born my sis married another man - and big surprise - he did not love her "other child" and they began by being unkind - this went to abuse - and removal from a home.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor - finish your education which sounds like you have a lot of promise.  There is plenty of time for a baby.  Not at 16.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	After getting off of the depo it could take up to a year. However every woman's body is different so it could take less time and it could take more time. I would stop taking the depo now but the thing is this, you can never really plan on when to get pregnant there are so many things that can happen/change. It just happens when it is supposed to happen. <br>  Tyffannie mother of 2 year old and 15 month old (im 21) on Depo shot|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	i'm not sure really what your question is...but...it is possible to get pregnant a couple months off the pill. but a baby isn't something that can always be planned...i mean i know people always plan to conceive but sometimes it doesn't work when you want it exactly so keep that in mind that october might not happen in reality....and yes the baby will be healthy...as long as you keep yourself healthy. somethings to do while trying to conceive would be taking prenatal vitamins now and stop smoking or drinking if you do any of that. good luck to you.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It can take up to a year or more to get pregnant after taking depo. Most people take a year actually because it takes a while for your body to start ovulating again. It may take you quite a while.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Maybe you should get a puppy? Go to college? Travel? Do something other than breed as a teenager.|`|1idd0Rl9aa	okay, first of all have a visit with your ob/gyn and talk to them and get a full check up so you can make sure that you are healthy. you don't need to create complications. talk to the doctor about the shot and when you should start taking a prenatal vitamin.<br>  eat healthy and dont take any over the counter medicines.<br>  teenagers are at high risk for lots of problems so please talk to your ob/gyn and get a full check up 1st this alone could save you and your baby a lot of problems.<br>  do you plan on getting married before getting pregnant? i only ask because i am sure you can't get any of his benefits unless you two are married before the pregnancy. ( i know this from experience)<br>  stay in school, be smart, don't go on welfare, work hard, and i can't say it enough THINK first. <br>  i had my first child when i was 24 and sometimes i think i was a bit young.<br>  having a baby is not all giggles. it is hard non stop work but it does have benefits. <br>  if i were you i would get married first and then start thinking about a baby. i married my husband and we got pregnant 1 month later. we had no time to ourselves to just be a married couple. <br>  i do NOT agree with teenagers getting pregnant i think it is a huge mistake and most end up alone and on welfare but teenagers are also thick headed and think they know best and MOST will do what they want at any cost. so please be smart!|`|SBeDh1f0aa	Since your young and all you have to worry about is cheerleading and marching, why don't you focus on your relationship?? Wait and see how good your body can look at 18, baby free! You should at least get married first and have this time with your sweetie. I wanted a baby back then, too, but I'm glad I never got pregnant! Insurance or not, you are still a child.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Okay, you seem to have it all figured out, so why are you on here asking for advice? Personally, you need not rush to have kids. Spend as much time with your fiance as you can to build a strong relationship before adding kids into the mix. You are trying to convince everyone that you are smart and mature, but if you were you would be smart enough to know there is no need to rush into having babies. Why don't you finish school, start a good career, and buy a house. Build a strong foundation for your future family, that way you can give your children the best lives possible.|`|Wnmg850Paa	I am in the military (wife) and I have never heard of any branch offering free child care. You pay based on your income and believe me it's not always the child care you want for your baby. You will not receive any benefits medical or otherwise until you are married. Your fiance will remain in the dorms or where ever he is leaving receiving the same pay as a single man.<br>  <br>    I know you have it all figured out but I recommend getting married, travel with the military and once your marriage is strong then think about babies. A lot changes when your husband deploys and comes home. You have to get to know him all over again, Don't rush, enjoy.|`|YP3rEESUaa	I was on the depo. and after the shot wore off (the usual 3 months) it took another 7 months for me to conceive my son.  the best think I can recommend is to track your BBT ( your waking temp in the morning) a good site to do this is www.fertilityfriend.com  and also keep track of your CM (cervical mucus) these 2 things will help you know when you are ovulating and will up your chances of conception.  <br>  <br>  now as for will the baby be healthy after having the shot, there should be no health concerns at all. just make sure to start taking prenatal vitamins when you are "trying" to conceive, that way you body will be healthy and ready to concieve.  Hope this helps and the best of luck to you.  I can tell that you arnt like most teens out there, your alot like me when I was your age. =)<br>  <br>  if you want to be pregnant by oct. then I would suggest not getting another shot.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	You are saying all the right things...but you honestly are too young! <br>  How do you recover in time for cheer-leading and band? How will you have enough sleep to have the energy to do band and cheer-leading? Who watches and raises your baby while you finish school and college??? I think you have missed some things! <br>  You should go off the shot now, and use condoms until you want to actively start ttc, however you need to rethink some choices!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Additionally, I would like to share some of my personal experiences with you<br>  I had a friend try for a year to get pregnant, she finally did, and delivered a healthy baby boy, except she passed away in delivery due to bleeding, are you and your boyfriend ready for this?<br>  I had another friend who tried and tried with her fiance, they finally got pregnant and lost the baby, their relationship ended as a result, are you and your boyfriend ready for the emotions invovled with a miscarriage? <br>  I had another friend who made it to the 12 week mark just to see no heartbeat during the ultrasound, are you two ready for this? Her and her boyfriend also broke up<br>  Lastly, I had a perfectly healthy baby...he is nine months old and my husband and I have seen the darkest parts of our relationship since having him. We cannot just spend money when we want, we cannot go out when we want, I had a seriously difficult recovery (son weighed 10 lbs 11oz). Are you and your fiance ready in your relationship to face this?<br>  Babies also get sick, some die from SIDS, some have birth defects...have you prepared yourself for this? A baby is not a fun little project, it's a life, that depends on you! <br>  <br>  It is not guranteed that any of these things will happen to you, but it is also not guranteed that they will not! <br>  Please honestly consider these things! Babies are VERY hard work and you need to be thinking more about how you will feed the baby, take care of the baby, nurture the baby, and less about band and cheer-leading!|`|qE6BlyCFaa	you dont get army insurance benefits unless ur actually married to him<br>  <br>  <br>  you sound somewhat smart...so hopefully u know wat ur doing<br>  <br>  <br>  id talk to ur doctor about ur birthcontrol and how it will effect you
Kw3dO045aa	When the weather is appropriate, I don't see why not?!  Babies need fresh air too. Ear aches could be a problem though. Ask a pediatrician.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If the weather is nice its just fine. If you are worried don't have the window all the way down to blow in your child's face... but it should be just fine.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	And just what do you think we did prior to AC in cars?|`|rmnvkIBXaa	i rolled down the front windows when the kids were in the back. the back windows were the child safe ones so they only went halfway, but i would just crack the back ones so the babies had some air but not enough to hurt them.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I'm sure it's safe to have a window or two down when there's a baby in the car...  though I wouldn't open every window full and drive down the motorway with a baby just because the wind can be quite harsh!|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I did all last summer. It's fine. I don't have air conditioning (going to fix that before this coming summer though) so I did it all the time.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	The only reason I can imagine this being unsafe is if something were to blow in and hit your baby . . . but things rarely if ever blow IN car windows, so I don't think there is an issue.|`|z6qYebkvaa	personally i wouldn't do it alot because it could take a little babys breath if the wind is strong or in heavy traffic but i did it when my air wasnt working but i cracked the windows that way the wind isnt so strong.  but now my baby is 2 and its no a problem now|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	as long as its warm enough outside then i see no problem in it...i prefer to roll the windows down or open the sunroof when it's warm enough and not use the AC|`|28QPS6V9aa	As long as it's not 20 degrees outside then I see no problem with it.
wWkfASTNaa	I was having similar pains and the doc said it is perfectly normal ot have some aches and pains during pregnancy. Unless the cramping is unbearable and accompanied with bleeding, it is normal. But you could also have a corpus luteum cyst, which are pretty normal apparently. <a href="http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,5335,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,53...</a> helped me alot when I had one|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	no you are not losing your baby it is totally normal mine just stop when i got to 16 week pregnant|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	I have been having these lately as well.

If they are I would be making an appointmentnt to see your GP as soon as possible. Good luck xo

BOJEbnCtaa	Its funny when you are a parent everyone tells you about the terrible 2's but no one says anything about 3 and 4 year old. Well the best thing I can tell you is consistency. Make sure you and your husband are on the same page with discpline or it won't work.  I wouldn't regret having him home with you. He is trying to see how far you will let him step over the line. Consistency.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Keep commands to one or two words. Don't threaten, if he doesn't do what he is told, put him in time out. Like someone pointed out, you and dad to be consistent and on the same page. After he comes out of time out, then repeat what you wanted him to do and stand there while he does it. <br>  <br>  What do you do when he is disrespectful? If you aren't using time outs, then take things away, TV, video games, whatever he likes. We are not opposed to a swat in our home.|`|AA10529334	No its not you or your parenting its just how a three year old is. They are mouthy disrespectful kids at this age. Just keep on him about it he will get better. <br>  <br>  Anytime a kid can be home with Mom is good for them. Dont think hes like this because of not going away for day care.|`|flU2gf54aa	Spanking works|`|AA10312653	he is just being a three yr. old......at this stage he is relizing the freedom of words. sit him down when he does somthing wrong and talk to him eye level ...dont show him your frustration...one of the kids i babysit is three and another is four(the others are two and six) the three and four year old boys like to say no, and talk back,(and even unfortunatly cussing) when they do somthing wrong the first time, i warn them, i tell them that they will either get a time out, spanking, or soap in the mouth(although now i dont warn about soap in the mouth becuase they know it will happen) when it happens again the punishment happens if they fight about the punishment or whine about it, i tell them im sorry you feel that way but i told you what was going to happen and you chose the outcome, if they dont go through with the punishment then it takes another step of being put in the bedroom. he is just a three year old being a three year old, but still must learn what is right or wrong....be firm about what you say (like actually show that you mean it)..........best of luck|`|qkvoAYoeaa	Perhaps he is not listening because you're not saying what he wants to hear.  "No, no .... and you shouldn't go that", are easily disregarded by young children.   He needs your parental support in the form of expressions of love and concern for him but also, how disappointed you are in him when he is disrespectful.  Barring a behavioral disorder, which he may or may not have,  kids that age need praise and approval of the parents and if you take that away,  substituting sadness and disappointment, while awarding a penalty as well, it may have a positive effect.  Do you reward him with your praise and approval when he does it right?  Some kids act in the manner described because the only attention they receive is when they do something wrong.  Also, a key to success is consistency on your part in dealing with his conduct.  What's correct and incorrect today, must also be, tomorrow and next week.  Be a loving, guiding parent.  After all, he's still just a baby, and must, with your help, learn what's acceptable and what's not...|`|8838a1367bf15736946a9ce17cee7b59aa	One day I was taking care of my niece and nephew and at that time they were 3 and 2 years old. They were screaming and I told them to stop. Finally, I started to do that and act like they were and it shocked them. They stopped because they did not like it. Show it back. If he wants something say no or I don't want to. Or you can ask him why. Good luck.Children are wonderful. You should never feel bad that you took him out of daycare. I used to work in a day care center. I would rather have my child at home than in daycare. Being a mom is a very frustrating but also fulfilling job. You are doing good.
VCCKfT3taa	You only have to worry if they're not rolling from both sides by 6 months. By then they should have it down and should move on to either crawling, scooting or pulling themselves up.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Perfectly fine. They have to start somewhere. My daughter did this at first then like 4 or 5 days later she went front to back.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	My daughter rolled back to front first at about 4 months. It's totally normal. She rolled the other way at about 6 months. Now at 12-1/2 months she's walking like a pro.|`|z6qYebkvaa	yes sits good my daughter never rolled either way and now shes 2 but can crawl walk talk and everything. she strated crawling at 9 months and never did tummy time cause she didnt like it but keep up the good work|`|TvYX1yXWaa	yeah thats normal. my sons 4 1/2 months and he doesnt  roll over at all .. every baby does things at there own time
72Fjnwz9aa	I had one birth 10 years ago, 7 miscarriages, and now I am 37 weeks preggo and this one is doing very well.There was only one that they clearly knew the issue on..it didn't attach right and the heart rate was 50-70, I choose to abort but it would have died or been born brain damaged (badly) So yes in my experience it is possible...its difficult to go through the losses and I wish you all the best.|`|afW58le8aa	I had two miscarriages about 6 months apart and am currently 9 months pregnant with my second son.  Don't get discourage, keep on trying.  Your next pregnancy will be so scary and you will be overly cautious about every little symptom you have but rest assured that you can have a normal pregnancy and a healthy, beautiful baby.

2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I think Madison Marie or Bianca Marie flows. Madison Marie would be my first choice. Personally, I'm having a difficult time coming up with a different middle name for Bianca. How about Bianca Rena?|`|VGij9p0Taa	Congrats on your little blessing, hope it's a girl! <br>  I don't like Madison Marie the two Ms together sound too alliterative and annoying a little rhymey too. Also Madison meaning son of Maud which is nice has become really popular. I like Bianca meaning white;fair it's very pretty Italian name that goes well with Marie. Depending on your surname depends whether it goes for instance William Wilfred doesn't go but Elijah Edison I think does, it depends if that makes sense. Use Marie as a middle name it's adorable especially as it's a family name have you thought of using it as a first name? More suggests for first names; Elizabeth, Zoe, Lilian, Alexandria, Kate, Imogen, Sage, Michelle, Jada, Rayne & Scarlet. <br>  Hope this helped and good luck!|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	My next daughter (lol) will be called Madison, well atm thats my fave name.

wRHhpanmaa	you can set a budget. you can pick up little things like a cake that has little baby decorations that says congratulations. get pink a blue little ballons and streamers. A lot of stores such as party city offer little party favors (such as little baby bottles and pacifiers and such) each person brings a baby gift such as clothes and such. And as for games, people do play them, and have little prizes. I had baby bingo at my baby shower. you can buy a few things online.|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Start off with a guest list. <br>  Know how many people might show up. This will factor in your Money situation.<br>  Find a place that will accommodate these people<br>  <br>  At a baby shower you do the same thing as any party <br>  eat, play games, open presents, have cake.<br>  <br>  But you better get on the ball about it the invitations should have been sent out a week ago!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Set a budget first. Then work around it. Then plan food, where you're going to get it or if peole are going to bring it (like a pot luck). Then think of decorations-- you don't have to do much for this. And people always seem to play games (weird).|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well the cost depends on whether u're renting a space or doing it at ur house. <br>  <br>  all u'll need is just some decorations, ballons, colorful plates ad cups and stuff, some little pouches w/ candy maybe for people to take home as a souvenir, and snacks w/ drinks. <br>  <br>  the baby shower is usually held for only 2 hours, so there won't be much time to do anything. u can make a list of different baby games u guys can play (just Google "baby shower games") but other than that just have a cake, food for people to eat, u guys will prolly just chat and then open presents, and it's time to go home :)<br>  <br>  oh yea, and u'll need the invitations to send out, so that can cost u some. i made my own invitations though.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	go to the site below. it will tell you everything you need to know and it has great ideas for everything you will need

I went for a walk this morning and a little sprucing up (painted my mailbox, helped my husband with a little yardwork) Celia and Emily along with one of their friends rode bikes all afternoon and Allison had some lacrosse practice.

We're a little worried about our dog, though - we have a newfoundland and they do not like warm weather!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	we had a wonderful day outside!  i'll tell you all about it later.  we actually experience sweat from the heat.  it was fantastic!  wooohooo spring is coming!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Its raining.

uFrqC4Y2aa	I would think that being thin would help you feel the kicks from the outside sooner. I'm just now feeling it from putting my hand on my tummy and I'm 29 weeks. I think it took me a while to feel it since my tummy's never been toned and thin. Also my baby's facing the inside so she's kicking my insides.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	everyone is different but prob somewhere between 20 to 24 weeks|`|uJJPFJoyaa	It differs from woman to woman. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "kick on the outside" but if you mean my being able to see the kick, it will later on during the 3rd trimester when the baby is a little bigger and has stronger limbs. By 30 wks is when I first could see him kick and poke around in their from the outside, but I have been feeling him move and kick since I was 20wks.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Probably between 20-22 weeks.|`|Q18V6sKwaa	between 4-5 months into your pregnancy.  that's when I did.

tkqV2CI5aa	If you even had one which it doesn't sound like, cause i have had two and they hurt worse than a bad cramp, i was in the floor. Then if you don't go to the doctor after the miscarriage, it will pass on it's on it and will hurt even more, when you have one, you need to get it out of you so it will not cause an infection or bacteria in your blood.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Doesnt sound like a miscarriage.

My parents didn't want me to go to a Brazilian doctor.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It's possible, but unless you see a doctor soon afterward you may not be able to tell.  It's very dangerous to skip pills.  If you are having difficulty remembering to take them at the same time everyday you may want to consider another form of contraception.  Good luck!|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Thats not a miscarriage you just had a lot of discharge. I had discharge like that when I was pregnant. A miscarriage is very painful and comes with a lot of bleeding.|`|7XfH78muaa	Probaly just some blood clotting.
TK0HKu0Iaa	My pregnancy has been okay so far but I'm kinda in the same boat as far as buying things is concerned. And I don't know why neither. I guess part of it is knowing that my fiance might want to wait until our shower since its our first baby to see what we get and don't get. I really don't want to wait though but for some weird reason just haven't hit the stores. I guess I wonder the same things even though I hear the chances are remote as well...<br>  <br>  You'll be fine just start off small...|`|yUyx2nhmaa	get over it - u have to get sorted before baby comes! u don;t want to be rushing around at the end when u feel like  beached whale and can't sleep. miscarriage at this stage is remote! u will feel less stressed knowing u have sorted things for baby's arrival<br>  <br>  edit - not sure why i got thumbs down when everyone else said the same|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	You'll be fine, take each day as it comes. When your ready you will buy things. Try and relax and look forward, plan for success she is going to be here soon! Your six months, be confident it's just your hormones playing tricks on you.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	your 6 months you shouldnt be worried its pretty rare to miscarry this late in your pregnancy. Just buy stuff and soon you will get used to it and probably want to shop more often!|`|PvnnWE1Baa	You're fine...You need to go ahead & start preparing for your baby girl, you don't want to wait until your 8-9 months & too tired to go shopping.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	listen as long as your doctor assures you that your pregnancy is doing fine all you need to do is think positive it's not you it's your hormones. now remember you want your baby girl to look her best when she is born so get her something to let her know that she is special|`|rzf4tMXGaa	Well its up to you, but once the baby is here and you have nothing you will regret it! besides shopping for the baby is fun ! I think you just have to warm up  and get into it.|`|GomqF0bfaa	Once you hit the 12th week of pregnancy your chances of having a miscarriage are very, very, very low. And at this point it would be considered a stillbirth. The percentage of stillbirths is also very low now with all the medical attention we get, and the health care that is provided to the pregnant mother.<br>  <br>  Having a baby is a very big step and change for any female and it's pretty normal what you are going through. I had an unplanned pregnancy, and was terrified of course because miscarriages ran in my family. So I tried to hold of on buying things and getting ready. But I started to buy stuff for my son, and just couldn't stop. It's a big step, but you will soon overcome it. Your mother instincts will kick in and you will soon see that it's just something that you need to do. <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd go out and buy your little girls first home coming outfit. That's something small, but means a great deal. Then just start to your yourself up the ladder. Just don't get overwhelmed with things. Have your partner, family, or friends help you plan things out. Make lists even to keep organized. Don't think about the negative within the pregnancy, keep your head up high! You have a tiny miracle in your belly!<br>  <br>  Good luck girl!<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I saw your additional details & thought that I'd add that I started to having braxton hicks contractions at 17 weeks into my pregnancy. It didn't cause any harm to my baby, and think of those contractions as a way of giving your baby a hug. lol. (That's what my doctor told me to stop worrying about them) I also was a HUGE putz during my pregnancy and ran into everything. Your belly is so filled with fluid that it's a huge cushion for your little girl. She is fine in there and will be fine.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	AH honey you are ok those damned hormones Hang in you and your baby will be great
apALY0sqaa	Sounds like you need to go in. My water broke in a gush with my first- but I have heard that a slow leak can feel like you constantly have to pee, or that you are like a drippy faucet.<br>  <br>  Also, if the pad is colored in any way go to the hospital ASAP!!!! That could be a sign of fetal distress. But you should go and get checked out anyway- once your water breaks, even though the body replaces the fluid, it is no longer a sterile environment. Baby could get sick, or you could.|`|58G7ZAJpaa	I personally couldn't tell you, but I'd go to the dr or call them and see.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!
vygYFdsSaa	Hi hunny those period cramps are very normal, don't worry too much. Congratulations on your bfp!!!!!|`|z03coR1Oaa	i was the same as you i had a miscarriage at 12 weeks then when i got pregnant  about 8 weeks later i was having all the sighs that i was about to have my period but i never did so quite a few months later i was blessed with a beautiful baby girl hope your bless too.|`|VMASMHX6aa	I'm sure you know that smoking while pregnant significantly increases the chance of having a m/c. It increases the risk by about a third.<br>  It's good that you are trying to quit but you shouldn't have been smoking while you were TTC. You smoked for the first 2-3 weeks of your baby's life. These are the most important weeks for development because that is when cell division is most rapid.<br>  You need to stop smoking today if you baby is going to have a chance.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	I am approximately 5wks too. I have been cramping like I'm going to start and it worries me also. This is my 3rd baby and I do remember feeling the same way in the other pregnancies. My dr told me the same thing and not worry. I know it's hard not to. Every little twinge I get I'm scared I'm going to miscarriage. I just keep telling myself, it is what it is and I can't change it. All you can do is try to live a healthy lifestyle and just relax.<br>  Don't feel ashamed about your smoking but I do think you should quit asap. Just try to do it for your baby.<br>  Good Luck and try not to worry.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Your doctor is right, cramping is normal!  Mine were so bad though, I was taking a test every day "just to make sure"!  Take a tylenol, get lots of rest, eat well, and stay off the ciggies - all of these things will help your body and mind heal and prepare for pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HQb7KK7kaa	Hi hun<br>  <br>  try not to worry, i am getting a few cramps as well and i am a bit worried but that just makes things worse,  take one day at a time right now and stay positive|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I had menstrual-like cramping in the beginning of my pregnancy with my son as well, and I, like you still smoked too.  But I was determined to quit smoking gradually (since that way it's not a shock to your system...which can cause miscarriage too.) So if you want to quit, do it gradually...I set my quit date to be Jan. 1st 2008 and that was it for me!  I haven't gone back since!  If you are afraid though, make an appointment with your doctor to be safe!  I wish you the best, and don't stress out!  That makes it worse!  Hang in there and relax!  You'll be okay!  Feel free to contact me if you need anything!  :)|`|2PcwdQ6qaa	hey hunni, i think i spoke to you the other day, im 5 weeks too and i have been feeling the same, but as i said last time i have had 3 miscarriages so im sooo worried too, i have to take celxane too which is a injection into my tummy, im trying to rest as much as possible, and i remember when i was pregnant with my daughter i got cramping, so just sit back and try not stress hunni thats what im doing!!<br>  <br>  <br>  xxxx|`|tGgLhOIGaa	No need to worry about the crampin its normal just your baby attaching itself to the womb and telling you he/she is going to be there for the next 9 months<br>  ive had it for the past week or so and im 5 weeks 6 days, anyway stop worrying and good on you for cutting down smoking im really proud <br>  <3|`|Ejit9dlsaa	I know exactly what you mean because I miscarried last time at 6 weeks but now am pregnant at 19 weeks.  I feel good now.  though even now still get period like cramps, try to not stress out about it I know it is difficult.<br>  <br>  as long as you've had no bleeding then you are fine.<br>  <br>  take care of yourself!!!<br>  <br>  xx|`|f5yf9t3Haa	The cramping is due to ligamet pains of ur uterus streaching..so as long as there is no blood don't worry. Just don't stress urself. <br>  As 4 smokeing plz try 2 stop I kno how u feel about being guilty. When I found out I was preggo I quit cold turkey for the first 3 months...then due to some stress yes I started again having 1 _ 2 ciggs a day. An unfourntaly I may go a couple of days w/o one. But I still do it. Just remember its never 2 late 2 quit..an there r others in the same situation u r & feel very guilty.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	i have the same thing and trust me sometimes it last for weeks i am 16week and 3day pregnant still have them since i got pregnant and this is my third child or you can go to google and type cramping in pregnancy and you will see when you should be worried or not.
ZzGLotRVaa	i think you should just stay at least untill you finish school because college cost a lot of money so why pay more for room and board or an appartment when you have a comfortable place you don't have to pay for. When you graduate college you can move away besides your mother won't be living with you which is a plus so just try to have fun|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Well maybe you could try out the roomate suggestion and if it still bothers you then, just go somewhere else.  Though I personally think that it'd be super fun to have my friends stay with me.|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	I say get you some roommates!
Ldvi6UPOaa	You are actually on the same regimen that I am on, Provera for 10 days, Clomid on CD 5-9 and Metforimin 500 mg twice a day. My period usually comes 2 days after my last Provera pill. If your period usually comes 3-4 days after your last provera pill, then I would suggest you wait until tomorrow just to see if your period will come by then. If it doesn't, call your doctor on Monday morning. They will probably make you take a blood test to see what is going on and maybe take an HPT.  I'm assuming you took an hpt already and it came out negative. You can actually be pregnant and that's why you haven't gotten your period. So I would definitely call your doctor on Monday morning and they can perform some test.<br>  <br>  I hope you are pregnant hun!!!! Good luck to you!!!!
eU5Eth2aaa	Ramen noodle are fine to eat...In moderation, of course.  Ramen is LOADED with sodium.  Maybe ad some veggies and chicken to give it more substance and make a little healthier!|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I'm sure it is fine in moderation.  I would recommend adding some broccoli or other veggies to it so you get some nutritional value.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I eat them all the time. I crave them too. there isn't anything wrong with eating noodles while pregnant I say go for it.. I think i am going to eat some for lunch today =D|`|VhH9RJrSaa	theres nothing wrong with ramen noodles|`|yo9XNz61aa	I ate the crap out of some chicken ramen noodles when I was prego....I bought the chicken boulion cubes to add some extra flavor...you can do it with the beef ones too!  Just dont over do it b/c they are full of sodium which makes you swell up!  Id say they are fine in moderation...I had them once about once a week and my baby is fine and I didnt swell up!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	The seasoning has a lot of MSG in it, which is really not good for the baby or for you. And ramen noodles are loaded with starch, and full of sodium... AND to much sodium is not good for an already swollen pregnant woman. I would try to limit how much you eat them.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	of course it's okay...I eat during my last two kids and everything was fine. If you crave it then eat it. There is nothing wrong with that.|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Yeah it perfectly fine! I love ramen noodles! The chicken flavor! yum! Girl ur fine!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Besides being high in sodium, there is nothing wrong with it! Yum!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i wouldnt eat all the time...they are loaded with sodium...which isnt good even when not pregnant...|`|AA11540246	dont eat too much because of the sodium|`|aYCjy8Neaa	It's fine, why wouldn't it be?|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	They are fine for you EAT ON MAMA EAT ON lol|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Its okay to eat it, but its not very healthy. Full of sodium and preservatives and no nutrients for baby. I wouldn't go crazy with eating them.

They usually don't provide them like they do diapers<br>  cute, but small outfit for pictures<br>  <br>  The hospital will dress your baby and put a small hat on his head every day. Your hats probably will not stay on your babys head. they usually give you diapers, and hook you up with all the essentials for baby, breastfeeding, ect. Your baby will not NEED anything but the CARSEAT!!  They will give you the essentials. Good luck!|`|UdICTUnaaa	you dont really need much.... just something for you to wear home from the hospital and your hygein products. you probably wont need anything for baby yet, the hospital should provide diapers for your stay. you can take something for the baby to wear home but just realize that newborn clothes probably wont fit right away, you'll have to get premie. the hospital provided me a onesie and a hat and diapers for my son... <br>  all i brought was something to wear home and an outfit for my son... thats it<br>  your husband can pack what he wants|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	My sister forgot to pack maternity pajamas. I'm actually going to get a pair for me today.

I'd definitely take:<br>  <br>  - some naturally sweetened lolly drops or candies for energy<br>  - some little muesli bars or snacks for energy - they might not let you eat "proper food" but if you get hungry it's worth having something to munch, as your uterus is a muscle and needs to keep up its energy levels<br>  - your own water bottle (so you don't have to keep asking for a glass of water from the jug)<br>  - 2x blanky or comforter or something that smells of home (smell is developed in a baby before birth, and he will know what you and your stuff smell like already - and you will find it comforting too in the sterile hosp environment - one for your bed and one for baby's bed, if they separate you)<br>  - dad's fav book or a few mags, as labour can go for a while and you might want to be left alone in your own head space for a bit<br>  - decent book or mags for yourself, to keep you occupied if labour slows or drags in the early stages<br>  - nice nightshirts or nightgowns (2x in case they get messy)|`|5wLu4Sqqaa	HI!! I am so excited for you!! All you need is the things you will be bringing the baby home in , and the clothes you will be wearing home...<br>  You may also want your Ipod,a book,and maybe something to write in,<br>  like a journal !! Relax and soak in every moment because before long your baby will be turning 18!! I know I had 5 kids and the oldest is 18!!<br>  Make sure you let us all know  how you and baby are doing!!|`|isH4APEcaa	dont forget sanitary towels and a cute outfit to put your newborn in for the photos. good luck.|`|VL0YFZr7aa	a camera!!!! <3|`|X6as2nOAaa	outfit for you and the baby to go home in, car seat, blanket for the baby, sometimes a pillow I didn't bring one though and a camera. I didn't use anything but my clothes and the car seat and hair scrunchy for me and the baby clothes and a blanket and the camera. I had way more with me but I didn't use any of it.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	well for yourself you need something to wear home from the hospital<br>  maybe some slippers and something to read/keep you occupied during your hospital stay<br>  Hygiene products, and maybe some pajamas<br>  <br>  <br>  for baby all you need is something for him/her to wear home<br>  <br>  <br>  dad you really dont need anything for him, maybe a camera
Iqifd3SGaa	They should be they don't have any caffeine in them and caffeine is the thing you should stay away from. But honestly I had caffeine my whole pregnancy, I cut down though, but my little man is perfectly healthy.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	of course! doctors recommend them if you have morning sickness! just watch the sugar intake.|`|d2MWWOwDaa	Well, they don;t have caffeine but they are full of sugar so I'd rather have a cup of tea!<br>  <br>  You're allowed 300mg of caffeine a day which is about 5 cups of tea or 3 cups of regular coffee.<br>  <br>  Personally I would rather have some tea than sugary drinks but it's up to you.<br>  <br>  Interestingly the research on caffeine and pregnancy may be flawed anyway - I read (and if I could find the source I'd link to it but I didn;t keep it) that while women who miscarried were found to have had caffeine more than those who didn't miscarry, they also didn;t have morning sickness and in fact it may have been the absence of morning sickness that signalled something was wrong rather than the caffeine.<br>  <br>  The theory is that possibly they were OK with caffeine because they weren't sick, so it's not necessarily true that caffeine is bad in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  However, it is a drug so probably best to err on the side of caution anyway, which is what I do. I drink some tea and no coffee.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	It's still soda, so it still has caffeine in it. <br>  If you like soda and want to keep drinking it, you can get caffeine free soda or ginger ale, which usually doesn't have caffeine in it.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	yep.....you can still have up to 300mg of caffeine a day if you are an addict, lol  I know I am!<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW Jessica the cans say caffeine free so no, Sprite does not have caffeine!

I've never really been a fan of Michael, I'm not sure why, theres nothing wrong with the name. I prefer Micah. David is a good strong middle name. <br>  <br>  Brandon David 6.5/10 I like the name Brandon but I don't think it flows very well with David. What about Brent, Brennan or Bryce? <br>  <br>  Hannah Marie 4/10 Sorry but I have always disliked the name Hannah, it seems bland to me. I prefer something like Hana (Hun-a) which is the name of a friend to mine. Marie is a good middle name. <br>  <br>  Sarah Anne 6/10 Sarah is a classic name that you can never go wrong with and Ann is also a beautiful middle name, preferred spelt like this, but together they don't fit because there both so incredibly 'common'. Keep Sarah as the first name for sure but try find a middle name thats a bit different to balance the name. <br>  <br>  SUGGESTIONS:<br>  Micah David<br>  Brennon David<br>  Bryce David<br>  Brent David<br>  <br>  Hana Marie<br>  Holly Marie <br>  Holly Anne<br>  Sarah Gwendalyn <br>  Sarah Annette <br>  Sarah Annabel<br>  Sarah Bethany<br>  Sarah Antoinette <br>  Sarah Marie <br>  <br>  Good Luck =]|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	Personally, i prefer names that are a little less common, but as far as traditional names go they're nice. Michael David flows a little better than Brandon David because of the two D sounds. I like Hannah Marie and Sarah Anne equally.

2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	Chins is ok for...well....the chin on your face. <br>  <br>  PLEASE don't subject your child to this. If you do, you're just asking for him to get beat up at school. <br>  <br>  I think going with Jackson as the first name would be great. And you can give him a nice name that flows with it. Like Charles or Stewart. Not suggesting you use either of them. Just suggesting you find something that will actually sound nice with it. I think with the name Jackson whatever first name you choose should be something that would also sound nice as a middle name if you decided to go that route. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes!|`|TffCSzHxaa	umm...

vKEYa8aeaa	is nicole the last name or a 2nd middle name? either way i LOVE IT. elizabeth is my favorite middle name for girls. too bad my husbands ex fiances middle name was elizabeth and i HATE her...so i refuse to use it =[ lol. <br>  <br>  but anywho i love the name its very cute but its not a name that is TOO cutesy and only works for a baby, it will work for her when she is a grown woman too. i think it is open to any personality, ive known haileys of many sorts! =]|`|vOFdHvlvaa	It's very cute, i'm not a big fan of of 2 middle names but these work very well together.<br>  <br>  I think of a tall, skinny, long brown haired, brown eyed girl, who is very outgoing and friendly, and always happy.<br>  <br>  Lol the only Hailey i know personally is exactly like this, so yea.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|Ym7H3x49aa	No I don't like it at all<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like this person is unoriginal and just thew in random names.

First of all great creativity! I think it would think that name would mean a very intelligent and sophisticated women (or girl or baby) It would also mean a very sporty person. Just think about it. " Hey hales,(Hales being a nickname for her full name) come play soccer ! We will be waiting!"<br>  <br>  Ok now on to looks. Dirty Blonde hair. Brownish sort of. Blue-greenish eyes. Smooth but kind ruff skin. Great smile. Full lips.<br>  <br>  Haily Elizabeth Nicole! Again how cute!<br>  ANSWERED BY FULANITOS LIL SIS!|`|nrquncpkaa	I absolutely love the name. I love having two middle names, especially these two! <br>  <br>  I think of an outgoing, friendly, freckled-face sweet little girl.|`|966w9UQTaa	I like Hailey.|`|4nuSg31Jaa	its ok|`|T0NvgQTUaa	I think its a cute name.|`|ldfhOc1gaa	i like it|`|VGij9p0Taa	I adore Elizabeth as it's my Grandmother's name (she was born in Northern Ireland but her mum is from Liverpool, her Dad was from Ireland though so she's Irish descant and birth I suppose), I also like Nicole meaning people's victory even though it's common. Those two names I really like their cute and flow together nicely. Elizabeth is so classy. However not too keen on Hailey meaning hay clearing. <br>  I imagine her too have blonde curly hair like the colour of hay, small and shy. Due to the Elizabeth bit (it being my Grandma's name) I imagine her to have a slightly Irish sounding voice. The Nicole bit makes me think that she will have a great fashion sense. <br>  Hope this helped.

im3vWyv6aa	It really does depend on the child. All of my children didn't start losing teeth until 1st grade (age 6). My niece, however, lost all her front teeth at the same time before she started Kindergarten (age 4).<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  .|`|kOmS5hCJaa	i would agree it is young! but it might be his time! if your worried i would check it out! good luck|`|AA12362903	It completely depends on the child.  My two older boys didn't start losing baby teeth until they were in second grade (third son hasn't lost any baby teeth yet but he's in kindergarten) but there were some kids in lower grades that had started losing baby teeth.  Our dentist said that the longer it took to get the baby teeth the longer they'll stay in the mouth.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.  If so, consult your pediatrician and I'm sure they'll tell you it'll be fine.|`|oAyOEkQYaa	I have twins, one lost their first tooth and 4 and a half and the other didn't lose a tooth till he was 7|`|xkJZwnHTaa	I lost my first tooth in Kindergarten (5)-not at all!|`|XrKviWgSaa	not really i had all of my adult teeth by probably 8/9|`|gknPGlDCaa	Not really <br>  depends on different people i think <br>  I had no baby teeth by the age of 7<br>  Actually i had very few teeth the big one didnt come till i was about ten!! lol|`|yzakyjNKaa	very normal i lost my first at that age

To nelly... try to be open minded and tolerant sweetie!!!!|`|a7b6cafe9cae420516d8aa38158cf12faa	Sorry no .<br>  <br>  I think you should  americanize your child's name  a little more.<br>  Give him the best of both cultures.<br>  <br>  Robert or Ryan <br>  <br>  Robert Hussein Hassan  my choice <br>  Ryan Hussein Hassan|`|K5KSeqTVaa	It sounds good; the kind of name that will still sound good when he grows to be an adult as well as being an interesting name when he's a kid.|`|FNb7a2kMaa	i think its nice..it goes..not too babyish but not too old<br>  <br>  good choice<br>  <br>  congrats! <br>  x|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Sorry but I dont like it.|`|d1guDJzyaa	What about the name Sadam?|`|C3aDxutiaa	nice|`|YEpBnVKIaa	I'm a Muslim myself, but I would not recommend Hussein Hassan. The adults and general populace just aren't in a pro-Muslim time right now, some people just do not understand that some Muslims just want to live a normal, peaceful life.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to beat around the bush and I don't mean to turn this into politics, so Reyan sounds like Re-an. So, I'd stick to the original.<br>  <br>  Whatever makes you and your partner happy is what you should pick. It's hypocritical, but if an online user whom you've never meet before doesn't like your choice, then do not listen to him/her.<br>  <br>  Technically, as the mother, you don't have to "do" anything, if your partner is forcing you to use the name you do not have to pick it.|`|RnQyZUHIaa	i like it but how about rohaan (pronounced [rowharn])|`|JfEXUqnKaa	Well, I don't particularly like it, But it's your son.|`|dWnN7mBPaa	I like Reyan.

JglwzEpiaa	Well hun your body has gone through a huge change over the last 9 months and it is just not used to it. Like you said your used to being active but now your body is just not letting you do what you want. The reason your body is doing this is because it can't right now. Don't push your self, only do what you can. Let that beautiful baby finish developing so it will come out healthy.<br>  <br>  The best of luck to you and your family and congrats!!!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Just start by taking short walks down the block and lengthen them little by little as it gets easier. It's getting hard for me too and I'm 29w4d.|`|AA11579568	Have you tried some kind of supportive waist band? A knee brace might help too. Make sure you have really good, supportive shoes.|`|Wpmkdwvtaa	im 39 weeeks prego and the same thing happens to me i just keep walking it off but i usually dont last very long, how i see it is do as much as you can without stressing yourself out and if your body does not allow you to what can you do!! You have a baby in you just about to be done so its almost over!! Good luck and dont force yourself your body is talking to you its important to listen to your body|`|72Fjnwz9aa	I am 37 weeks and this happens to me...doc said they are Braxton Hixs..they are fine not labor..labor does not go away when you sit..I just try to walk through them..though they do knock the wind out of me...Just take some one with you when you walk..but don't stop walking its helpful to bring baby down and exercise in a healthy pregnancy is good for you and baby. Just maybe make the walks shorter, remember your knees are carring extra weight too.|`|HTN7g3B1aa	those sound like contractions - when your stomach gets really hard for a little, then stops and then does it again. not saying you're in labor, they may just be braxton hicks. but it sounds like contractions to me.

Fh4B88ZGaa	Does your doctor know about the spotting? Your doctor should be the one giving you direction about this.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Well, the toothache probably has nothing to do with being pregnant.  If you decide to go to the dentist about it, make sure you tell them you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Being queasy is just morning sickness.  I had it 24 hours a day until I was about 14 or 15 weeks.  I'm just now getting over it.<br>  <br>  As for the spotting, maybe you should call your doctor's office and let them know.  They may want to see you sooner.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CGFAPKJOaa	No. I spotted up until almost 10 weeks. I know it's scary, but it'll fade. If it becomes like a period flow, then you may want to call your doctor.<br>  <br>  Relax, and put your feet up!|`|DwTTt628aa	hi well i had slight bleeding when i was 5 weeks it was just spotting but then at 9 weeks i had alot more and i ended up having a miscarriage but it does not mean that for you it could be that its the embryo implanting or your period that you should of had but just to be safe i would get it checked out asap just to reasure yourself, i also bled though on my 1st pregnancy but everything was ok i hope everything turns out ok 4u x|`|Oz4iblUEaa	Hon yes alot of women have spotting in pregnancy! I got worried sick after havin alot of bleeding after sex dr said it was normal but with my history of 5 misscarriages he sent me for ultrasound and babies heartbeat was strong! feeling weird is normal and sick get use to it sweety I stay sick! they have even tried meds on me that they use on very sick people and still nothin helps! Pregnancy is different for every woman! But if you get cramping real bad and you can not stand it and ur dr's aint open go straight to ER.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Have you let your doctor know about the spotting? The not feeling well is very normal in early pregnancy, spotting can be too but you should let your doctor know. I spotted some with this pregnancy. Your doctor may want to do a 48 hours blood draw where they draw your blood and then 48 hours you get it drawn again and they see how fast the HCG level rises in your blood. It should double. If it does then everything is normal and the pregnancy is healthy. If it doesn't, it can show that there may be a problem. Call your doctor. This test made me feel SOO much better.|`|1bfaf5678bff96eef7c7653c5e72f230aa	Feeling weird is a part of being pregnant, you have another life inside of you, don't worry about that! You need to go to an ER and not wait until Tuesday. There may be something wrong, maybe not. Try and take a deep breath, 9 times out of 10 there is nothing to worry about. You are not bleeding heavily, so you should be fine, but please go to the hospital now, and now 3 days from now. Good luck!!
uFrqC4Y2aa	It happened right before I was scheduled to get my period. (A few days). It lasted just a few minutes.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I didn't hve implantation bleeding but I did bleed during my 7 week and it scared the crap out of me.  Doctors say that it was caused by the fusing of the membranes'.  It hasn't happened since Thank God!!<br>  <br>  Also, I just wanted to say to Jackie that we chose the same avatar face!  weird.
VKQzj4Pmaa	The car accident may or may not have affected him in the sense of his attachment to you. Either way, it is important that he learns more independence away from you.<br>  <br>  I know it seems hard, but you need to let him continue to visit his grandparents every now and then, or any other family members you trust your son with. I know he cries and you feel horrible, but it really needs to be done.<br>  <br>  Just to reassure you, children go through this all of the time! Ever heard of kindergarten? Parents bring their kids, and the kids cry and cry when mommy or daddy leaves. This usually goes on for the first few days, possibly a couple of weeks, but they soon get over it, and they learn to accept that time of separation as normal. <br>  <br>  Don't make goodbyes too long, as that only drags it out and makes things harder. One kiss, one hug, I love you, I'll pick you up at such and such time and then we'll go home, I love you bye. If he starts crying or makes a scene, don't say anything, and just leave and don't look back.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	Talk to him and say how this is not how big boys behave and if he doesn't do it he will get a treat. make him a reward chart. every time you leave him and he is good he gets a sticker on his chart. 3 stickers equals a treat. tell him that if he does kick off u will have to ignore him because that is not how big boys behave. and ignore it. do not give attention to negative behaviour as it reinforces it. .  know it is hard but if he kicks off u'll just have to walk off and leave school to sort it out. i'm sure he's fine within minutes. good luck.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Yeah like star said, I had to do the same thing with my son. Did the sticker chart, if he got the smile face for (5) days, he got to pick something fun to do, like a movie, going to the park, ect...<br>  My son is now in 2nd grade and I don't need to do the chart anymore, but did need to do it for the kindergarten and 1st grade.<br>  If he miss behaves then just worn him of getting the sad face sticker. Worked great for me!
uFrqC4Y2aa	You're 16 and money isn't a problem for you? What do you do for a living? I work as an accountant and money is a huge problem with having a baby especially since we're saving for a house and I plan on taking at least a month off of work. I need to do what you do for a living!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well having some money saved up and having a job is great, good for u guys.<br>  <br>  i haven't given birth yet, but i can tell u wut's great and wut's not as far as 32 weeks.<br>  <br>  The Bad: morning sickness, headaches, sometimes heartburn so bad u keep waking up during the night, back pains, tiredness, fatigue, horrible stretch marks (cocoa butter hasn't helps at all so far)...up until 30-31 week i've been feeling pretty good comparing to now. now for the past week my crutch has been hurting like i've been riding a bike w/ a really hard seat over the bumps all day (the inner thighs and pelvic area really sore) it's from my bones shifting to make the space for the baby to come out. also my feet are starting to swell, so as my fingers. every morning i wake up in horrible pain, if i'm lucky enough, i walk it off after an hour, but once i get up, i feel like i'm walking on needles.<br>  <br>  The Good: well obviously no more pms, that's been the best part lol my skin has cleared up from all the acne i used to have, i haven't seen it this clear in years :) also i have a very good reason to eat healthy and delicious food. the best of all is the feeling of the baby moving inside of me, it's the most amazing thing i've ever felt.<br>  <br>  don't worry bout wut people say bout ur age. i'm 21 and i got my GED 2-3 years ago, i'm somewut in debt and haven't got any degree, only have a part time job and my b/f has been layed off, and it seems like u guys r in a better situation than us (21&23) so as i see it, the age doesn't matter, it all depends on wut u do w/ ur life. i regret not going to college when i should've and not finding a better job, it's too late now, at least until i give birth. so u have to make sure u have some kind of plan on wut u'll do w/ ur life, no matter whether u have a baby or not.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|S4pNsW3Taa	There is NOTHING bad about being pregnant. I am loving every second of it|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Bad: Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headaches, migraines, back pain, round ligament pain, constipation, heartburn, acne, stretch marks, sleeplessness, irritability, mood swings, swollen feet, and eating a strict diet to make sure your baby is getting all the needed nutrients and nothing that would be harmful.<br>  <br>  Good: Cute belly, sometimes getting special parking spaces, extra help from family/friends, baby clothes shopping, feeling the baby move, getting ultrasounds, and of course the final product (baby)!<br>  <br>  No matter how much money you have saved up at 16, unless you and you boyfriend both have full-time high salary jobs money will definitely be a problem.  I'm 22 and had two jobs and my husband is a salaried GM and it is still very tough sometimes because babies are way more expensive than you think!  And unless your parents are going to baby-sit for free, many times daycare can cost more than what you make at work.  Good luck!|`|84b26tbzaa	yeah you will be fine i had a baby at 17 and hes 4 now and im 18weeks pregnant with my second one at 21 .... the good things about pregnancy is that you get to feel and watch your baby grow. and share it with your boyfriend the bad part is the sickness that come along with it the headaches the vomiting and nausea the aches and pains but when you get pregnant you have to realize that a baby is growing inside of you and your body will change so i wouldn't say that s such a bad thing. an what out for the moodiness that comes from your boyfriend at times they get a Little skeptical about the whole thing even if it was planned and they don't realize that there hurting you but if he does start to act up he ll get it together if he wants the best for you all and reality will hit him once the baby is born i wish you the best of luck and get allot of rest while you can because nights will get sleepless|`|DYJOpfvraa	For you the bad part is saying goodbye to your teenage hood and hello to full-time motherhood. The good part of it is that you will have a beautiful baby soon.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	I loved being pregnant with my 2 boys. I just found out I'm pregnant again and I'm thrilled. It is a wonderful thing to feel your baby growing inside of you. You are going to experience alot of ups and downs during your pregnancy. The joys will be feeling your baby move the first time to looking at your baby for the first time. Plus so many wonderful things in between.<br>  Of course there are hard things too, remember  wonderful things in life don't come easy.<br>  It's going to be harder for you because you are young. You are definitely on a more difficult path because of this pregnancy. That doesn't mean you can't go to college and have success in your life. It just means you are going to have to work hard.  I hope that you have family to support you emotionally and financially. <br>  Good luck! I wish you the best.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	You may think money isn't a prob, but lemme tell you, it goes quick! Good: You have a mini-you, unconditional love, gosh there is so much joy in having a little one! Bad: Money(lol), no sleep, pregnancy(nausea, bloating, sore and/or leaky breasts, huge belly, back pain, heartburn, etc) Responsibility of raising another human being. It is all a lot of hard work and your work is never ever done!!! But it's all worth it!!!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah I forgot about the stretch marks and acne, lol....Let me just add absentmindedness too!!! lol|`|72Fjnwz9aa	I had my 1st son at 19, now preggo 10 years later here is what I learned. <br>  Bad: Your life as you know it will change, friends will dissapear, strange looks from strangers, and constant judgement from strangers and those you love..Judgement will change as you mature though, School will be harder (please stay and tough that out though) People you reliy on to help and baabysit will disapear as the novaltiy of the baby wears off. Work choices will be harder because it is hard to find daycare in the hours that are needed, finding a day care is horrible and requires alot of reasearch. Also you may go through jobs because babies do get sick and you will need to take time off..do reasearch on family freindly jobs. Balancing social life and baby life and work life is extremely difficult. You may get sad and deppressed about the loss of freedom, You will want to still be a teenager and party but having a baby that is out of the question. Money no matter how much you have saved you will need more..unless you have millions in that bank account you will need alot of  money. Making sacrifices.learning the babies needs come before yours..you see those shoes in the store but baby needs diapers or clothes. Complete and utter selflessness, You are no longer just you, you are you and baby.<br>  <br>  Good:<br>  Babies and children are fulfilling, your heart will swell with tears the first time that baby smiles at you, the sweet things they say to you in all thier honest glory. Their first day of school, school play and the first time they say they love you..because they really do. They become your ever reason for living. Even though the good is short and sweet and there will be alot of bad..the good out ways all of the bad and can only be there with the experience with a child. <br>  You will grow up fast and it will be scary but if you can be strong and get through it it will be the most rewarding thing in your life. You will now be able to understand everything your parents have been trying to teach you.<br>  Good Luck.
0ky4TktEaa	I'd say around 2. You'll notice when you should start by their behavior. Around 2, you'll see an increase in outright disobedience, tantrums, they'll even start telling you "NO!". When they're pitching toys and stuff, it's time to start. Younger than that, you need to just take stuff away and send them to do something else; most won't really understand why you're making them sit there although a few will. Basically, if they're old enough to cut up for the sake of cutting up and knowing the whole time that they're cutting up, start doing time out.|`|p07RwZK2aa	As soon as they understand what is going on. <br>  I started with my twins at 18 months. <br>  I started at 1 with my son, as he saw it happen to his older sisters and he understood.|`|iEsICA3Maa	Once they start misbehaving, you should start. You should also use the Green Yellow Red, method. When a child does something bad, give them a Green Light. Next time they misbehave, Yellow Light. Third time, Red light and in the "Corner" for 5 minutes. Put a little timer next to the chair so you'll know when to let them out. Tell them, "When the bell rings, you may leave" Sometimes they'll stay, sometimes they won't. If they leave, before the timer is done, another 2 minutes.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Remember that it has to be age appropriate.  1 minute for every year.  Their attention span won't conceive anything else.  The sooner you start showing that there is a consequence for unacceptable behavior the sooner you will be able to have a well behaved child.  Let the child know what they are doing wrong, give them a chance to change the behavior, warn them that it must stop or you will put them in "time out" and then if they don't, you must follow through.  This is as much about your willingness to stop whatever your doing to correct the child as it is about the child being willing to sit in the chair.  Be strong, be patient and be consistent.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I started with my daughter when she was a year and a half. Most experts say not until two. We do a warning and then punishment. Like if she hits me I tell her please don't hit mommy that hurts. If you hit again you will go in a time out. If she hits me again. I tell her Leandra that hurts mommy. Time out now. She gets a 2 min time out.|`|rDPADat1aa	I started it with my kids at 1.  They were old enough to understand at that point.  You only do time out according to age though, so at 1 they had to sit for 1 minute.  My daughter is 3 now and sits 3 minutes.|`|UIF7OBuxaa	Watch super Nanny. <br>  <br>  They show a method where you put the child in as minutes = to their age, like if the child is 2 they'll get 2 minutes, but if they leave you calmly walk them back to the area and start the time over, every time they leave, sooner or later they will get the picture and sit there. After coming out they are to apologize for what they did to be put into time out.|`|JAKvotuZaa	I use time out with my toddler, It's the only thing that works sometimes. I started when he was around a year and a half. If he's doing something he's not suppose to, like climbing on the coffee table, I tell him to stop and few times and if he still won't I say "If you don't stop climbing on the table you're going in time out" then if I see him start again I say "Do you want to go in time out?" And if he still persists I sit him in a chair and say "You're in time out now, stay here" then he screams, and usually he sits there for only a couple seconds before he comes running after me. It actually works really well, I only had to put him in time out a few times and now just when I ask if he wants to go in time out he stops right away.|`|YKVvojF2aa	When my son was about 14 months and could walk and understand "NO" and "SIT DOWN", then I knew he was ready.  My son is 2 1/2 now and time out is not working so, he gets sent to his room.  It honestly depends on how consistent you are.  Time out is a hard method, but it does work.  It takes a couple of tries but you have to be consistent. If he gets up put him back and start all over.  Visualization is the best.  Get just a cheap egg timer and pick the same spot every time.  I carried the timer with me too and it did not matter where we were, he got time out and still does.  As much as I was spanked as a kid and as much as I wish I could have just been able to spank, I feel my son is too young, and I would rather get stared at for using a timer in public for discipling my child then to spank him and have people stare and make comments.  All I say is "Ethan, mommy told you to keep your hands to yourself, and I told you if you hit your going in timeout.  Go to time out".  Thats all I have to say and he pouts and whines but he goes and sits.  I use to have to carry him kicking and screaming.  But now all I have to say is "Go to your room and sit on your bed and do not get up until I say so".  He cries like he is getting spanked but he goes and sits.  I go and talk to him and he has to "fix" what he did to get him in timeout.  (Apologize, pick up what he messed up, wash the crayon off the wall), it did not happen over night, but I stayed with it and followed through.  Those are the key points.|`|0Zpkpu1waa	If you want to go that method raise your voice and make sure they know they are wrong. I'm sorry but toddlers loose interesting if you talk them to death.  You'll see a blank stare or them not looking at you if you use big words.  Then pick a spot away from what the problem is and make them sit until you think they have calmed down.  The whole minute per year is bunk.  It really depends on how upset the child is and how long it takes them to calm down.|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	I started with time out on my twins when they were able to really understand the word No. <br>  <br>  If you do start only put them there for a few min. That seems forever to a child. Before taking them out of time out make sure to tell them what they have done wrong or they wont get it.<br>  Then I always give them a hug and kiss tell them you love them and let them be on there way.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|9KrSwJbEaa	I use the 1-2-3 method!!<br>  if my son does something and I tell him that if he doesn't stop or whatever and I count to three he goes in time out

HCG levels have a big range of what is normal,sometimes with lower numbers you just have a late implanter.The more important thing is that it continues to double.Good luck.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I got mine checked right away and was never told my actual level. But I do know that the HcG doubles every 72 hours. So it looks like yours are perfect. Good luck.

The men pick the boys names.  Consider the family tree.  If not a family name then go for something disctinctive like place of birth or a last name that works for a first name such as Anderson or Campbell or go through the names in the phone book, then someday when he has his own company it will sound like two people in the firm.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I try to choose names that flow together.

8kaDm2D8aa	i am totally against it, they tried to induce me twice & it didn't work.  they won't let you eat for 12hours before they give you the meds.  a hungry pregnant woman is not a pretty sight!  then i read the side effects of potocin & they were not good.  anyways, they tried to induce me at 39 & 40 weeks.  at 41weeks they stripped my membranes & i went into labor that night.  the doctor basically sticks his fingers up your whoo-ha & wiggles them around, then viola-baby comes with no drugs.<br>  <br>  edit: it's YOUR body & YOUR baby, the dr can't make you do anything you don't want to.  that's what the nurse told me.  i was so upset after the 2nd induction, they wanted to do a 3rd.  my nurse was amazing, she said if it doesn't feel right to you, don't do it.  at the end of the day you have to live with your decision, not the dr.|`|VHHis05Naa	I was induced and hope like heck I won't have to go through that again this time around.  It was rough...took two days and was very painful.|`|X6as2nOAaa	If you go over your due date and you want to be induced then I would just tell the doc if not then ride it out.|`|9RcwQgNpaa	Hi, I know how you feel.  I found the prospect of being induced frightening, but when it came down to it there was no alternative.  I got to 38 weeks and because of various reasons my doctor decided to do a membrane sweep, to maybe start things off.  It gave me cramps and a "show", but certainly no labor.  I gather that's quite common. A sweep is not a very reliable labor starter.  I did all the things to bring it on- raspberry leaf tea, bouncing on a birthing ball etc.  Plus, I'd gone into premature labor at 32 weeks (it was stopped), and had the baby "turned" manually by the doctor (she was breech at 36 weeks), this can sometimes trigger labor.<br>  <br>  But by the time I was at 42 weeks (being monitored by midwife and doctor), I was begging for an induction!  I had started my 43rd week (just) when I went in for it.  And all turned out OK, but ended with an emergency c-section as baby inhaled meconium (her poo!) and was distressed.  But all was well.  I think labor is labor, however it starts, and ends.  I know it's daunting, but you can get through it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	well you can ask the doctor, but in the end it's ultimatley their decision. Sometimes you can go to 42 weeks, because you must remember your due date is just an estimate, it could be a few weeks off. <br>  But if by 42 weeks the doc will induce, because more than likely your little bundle of joy will have a bowel movement and that could be deadly. But keep your head up!|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	I'm like you...don't want to be induced, but if I need to be then so be it.  I guess ask your doctor what the criteria is and how long they will let you go if babe is doing ok and you are holding up.  42w seems to be the magic number, but some seem to induce earlier.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	I would say if your that close to having the baby and your doc suggests it, it maybe a good idea. If you want to try and wait the baby could get to big and you could have complications during birth.<br>  I was induced a week early and it wasn't that bad to be honest.|`|5h8bYsKdaa	you should look into evening primrose oil. midwives sometimes recommend it to get things moving, like dilating. i started taking it around 38 weeks every day afew times a day to ensure things would get movin
CuCrGDuRaa	I have my nipples pierced and was told that they would have no effect on breast feeding whatsoever.  I occasionally leak a little bit of colostrum from where the holes are, but that's fine.  Ask your doctor at your next appointment if you are concerned, but you should be fine!

YyHflEecaa	I had the same thing.

If you want freedom you need to prove to them that you are trust worthy, and to do that you need to show them you have nothing to hide, and to do that you need to let them continue watching over you until they get tired.

Fy9S6hjIaa	LOL!  My sister got pregnant 3 months after I did.  She was pregnant with her 3rd and me with my 1st.  So, I was 5 months preggers and she was only 8 weeks and she looked so much more pregnant than I did.  I always tried to wear clothes that made me look pregnant, but no one could tell.  She on the other hand wasn't planning on telling people she was pregnant until after 3 months but everyone could tell by 6 weeks.  My mom said it was because it was my sister's 3rd.  She said that with each baby you start showing quicker and quicker.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	I gained a total of 9 pounds with my first baby (I was only 16) after I lost weight from morning sickness- by the time I delivered, I was only 9 pounds from where I started. Now 15 years later- I am having my 2nd baby and I started showing very early (like 6 weeks). They say your body knows what it's supposed to do and goes ahead and starts getting ready for the baby. Plus, things are a little looser and from being stretched out by previous pregnancies, so you may show sooner.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You may just be showing faster than what you did with your first two, or are further along than what you think. When I was 4 weeks I was already showing because my uterus was swelling. So it's likely not a "baby bump" yet, just your uterus rapidly expanding. And then you are thin, so you will show earlier than most people would.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i am very thin also,i started to show at 8 weeks,i had a bump,at 2 weeks when i found out,i tought i was really really bloated and expecting to start my period....i was only 87 pounds when i got pregnant...if you are that skinny,it has no where to go but out!....and that early in pregnancy alot is bloat,and fluid....|`|OHgtarUMaa	You show sooner after your first pregnancy!!|`|nmCwpD55aa	well every pregnancy is different.i wouldn't worry about it but instead take care of yourself and your baby.|`|v3LnJycKaa	probably bloat, i thought iwas showing within the first 8 weeks with this baby (also my 3rd) and was so nervous because i never showed early, well by week 12 i was back in my prepregnancy jeans until now.. I can still fit them confortably at 23w4d... i think your body will readjust over the next few weeks.

Listen to what your doctor said, take it easy, and relax.
NhuxAPFsaa	You could be ovulating, or just gettin ready for your period... its only 7 days away!|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	It is too early to test.  Wait until you miss your period, but my only sign of pregnancy was tender breast.  It would hurt on teh sides, and sometimes all over.  Good luck!

vKEYa8aeaa	ive had that since i found out i was pregnant, my doctor said its just hormonal changes. bring it up to your OB at your next appointment. but as long as your blood pressure has been/is fine then its probably nothing to worry about as far as circulation goes. i find that shaving my legs often and putting lotion on right after i get out of the shower helps with the itching.|`|PvnnWE1Baa	My chest & stomach gets really itchy & my doctor recommended using Eucerin for Itchy Dry Skin & it really helped!

Or, what about a WebCam so you can call them and they can see the baby whenever they want to se him/her?|`|U9wHEud9aa	Have you thought about a Photo Collage Jigsaw Puzzle to commemorate the event? <br>  <br>  Their first grandchild is a big deal to most grandparents and a personalized gift such a Photo Collage Puzzle is a great way to cellibrate the event as well as bringing enjoyment. After the child is born, take a few photos and let the guys at Jigsaw2order.com put them together into a professional photo collage. Don't worry, you get a chance to review and approve the photo collage design before they make a puzzle. Once completed, it can be framed and put on the wall as a keepsake of the birth of their first grandchild.|`|28QPS6V9aa	I have never heard of getting gifts for grandparents. You're the one having a baby not them! They don't need gifts. You could just give them a card or something. A new grandbaby is a gift itself.

Also it is humiliating to  be spanked at 16 ..There are rare situations where very drastic measures might be called for in which a good *** whipping might get a boys attention ...but we are talking about the last resort kind of thing and usually only in life and death situations ....the bottom line is spanking a teen is never a good idea and it should only be done as a drastic resort  but not as  an ordinary punishment ..<br>  <br>   Nature provides a very effective way to for males to keep their sexual passions in check and i would suggest that if Dad is not around that his you should encourage him to practice it ..It being in lay-mans terms ...Spanking the monkey <br>  Flogging the Bishop or Shucking Corn ...Tis better than having a string of bastards from here to Nova Scotia or dying with a venereal disease ..<br>  <br>  JIM YOU made me laugh my *** off with that last line thank you ye lord of the Ottawa Moose.
xuEDHU1Naa	When I was trying with my daughter, who is now 3.5 years old, I had something similar happen to me.  I didn't have the UTI, so that is where my story differs from yours, but I don't know how that would really effect ttc.  We started ttc in June (I got pregnant in November) and in September something like what you are talking about happened to me.  I went from being SUPER regular to being a week late.  Test after test after test was negative.  It was so frustrating, but in the end it was just my body readjusting I guess.  Who knows.  I went back to being regular after that.  I had read somewhere that our body changes every 5 or 7 years, I don't remember exactly now what it was.  So I guess that is what it was for me.  I would wait and see if you still don't get it in a few more days.  <br>  <br>  The other thing that I have learned through my TTC journeys (I also have a 16 month old son) is that you can ovulate late.  Most women with a 28 day cycle will ovulate on day 14 (this is 14 days from the first day of your period) and then will get their period 14 days later.  However some woman ovulate later than that and some months can be different from others.  I usually ovulate on day 16, but some months I have ovulated as late as day 18.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend you check out fertilityfriend.com.  It is a great site.  There is a fee to join to get all the features, but it isn't that pricey and you can put your account on hold if you want or if you get pregnant and reopen it when you start trying again.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!  Hopefully you get your positive soon or your period shows so that you can get started on your next cycle!  :-)|`|yp9rEMSraa	I would wait a few more days and test again.....I have heard that your body's immune system is down when you are prego so that might be why you got a UTI.....headaches and being tired are signs of being prego but depending on what medication they put you on it might be that...i hope that you are but i would test again in a few days...this might give you a better reading....<br>  LOTS AND LOTS OF BABY DUST
diT2WFfCaa	If you haven't had sex, you can't be pregnant.  It's as simple as that.<br>  <br>  BUT...if you've "fooled around" and some semen has come in contact with your vagina, then it is possible.  Unlikely, but still possible.<br>  <br>  If you haven't had that happen, then I wouldn't be worried about being pregnant.  There are many other things that could be causing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|BrERsGEIaa	WHAT ARE YOU?

But if you are pregnant your **** will grow bigger+your stomach will be big like a pillow.<br>  <br>  You will feel that your stomach is constantly being pushed if you had a baby inside it.<br>  Your probably ill. Ask your mum to buy you gaviscon advanced it will help you get rid of the pain.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	No sex = no baby!<br>  <br>  You have most likely read about the symptoms and are imagining them (the mind is a powerful tool). You may just be experiencing a change in your cycle as you are young so discuss this with your doctor and he/she will give you advice on how to regulate it.|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,<br>  <br>   If you have not had sexual intercourse then you can not be pregnant!<br>  <br>   It probably a virus or something - the doctor will probably ask you to do a urine sample - testing for pregnancy or even a blood test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Lx|`|B6cOlFU9aa	You can't be pregnant if you have never had sex, its impossible.

Don't be paranoid.|`|ZcFchrkhaa	OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10696234	Hmmm... actually you don't actually have to have sex to get pregnant...( unusual but true) have you fooled around with a boy but not actually gone the full way? has sperm been involved in anyway at all near you down there? even with underwear left on??? or possibly transefered down there by your boyfriend if you have been feeling each other ( you know what i mean. I am trying not to sound vulgar) <br>  I doubt you are pregnant, but nature has a way.<br>  I hope you are not, it is probably just a virus. good luck  and let us know by editing your question when you find out.|`|rn6gY3vLaa	You can't get pregnant unless you have actually been exposed to semen, as it were. It would be immensely unlikely but there is a minute chance you could get pregnant having had non-penetrative sex.

Then after you are done eating let the kids play for a little bit then do cake, open presents, and then let kids play again until it is time to leave.
FkGh0LuWaa	Call you doctor and ask about her seeing a speech specialist.  The one my son saw came to our house and evaluated him and then scheduled appointments for every week.  She also gave us different exercise to do with him to help him speak better.  Your daughter will most likely also need to be evaluated and then they will figure out what is the best way to help her.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	Contact your school district and ask for an evaluation with a speech pathologist.  <br>  <br>  Or ask your doctor for a referral to an "out-patient" speech therapy center for an evaluation....you'll need to find an agency that takes your insurance and then pay co-pays.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	take her to a speech therapist!

WU9nwTg4aa	LOL I thought it was a troll question until I clicked it and saw it was serious.<br>  <br>  He was probably shocked or stunned for a bit and then got up. Did he cry? If he didnt then falling didnt hurt him. So dont worry! <br>  <br>  My brother did that last week. He was learning to walk and then he tipped over and hit his head on the side of a chair. He was really quiet and then in a few seconds the pain kicked in and he was crying hysterical! He is just fine now after I put ice on it and now there is a bruise but he's back to normal.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Just keep an eye on him, but if it was on a carpet chances are he'll be fine.<br>  My daughter did the exact same thing at that age, we were in a hotel and she got so upset that she barfed on me.  Of course I called the pediatrician right away and he told me what to look for to be sure she didn't have a concussion, she was fine and the doc said  the vomiting was probably just because she had just eaten and got scared.|`|JsffWlnEaa	stunt baby?|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Did he cry?  Is he acting normal? If he cried and if he was acting normal, then he's fine.<br>  <br>  Get used to him falling now, because this is only the beginning.

Since babies don't have fused skulls, they are better at taking bumps.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	It probably just scared him.

MJMsOFpiaa	1. Yes<br>  2. Yes, but I haven't seen it too often so it is alittle odd.<br>  3. Well, typically girls don't like what they have. Like if they've got curly hair they want it straight, so usually they don't absolutely loove their name so they don't do it as often. And usually the guy passes on his name as a sign of pride and it's a priviledge. A guy keeps his last name too, so name has more symbolism for guys in my opinion.|`|goCkjhDzaa	Question 1) Do you think it's okay for a son to be named after his father?<br>  My brother was named after our farther. I guess it's okay seeing as he is the last boy born in the family.<br>  <br>  Question 2) Do you think it's okay for a daughter to be named after her mother?<br>  I was named after my mother (ICK!) It is soo annoying when I go to the doctors and they confuse my records with my mother's. Or when we are at a family function they call Karen (our name) and having both of us turn our heads. I have always tried to be an individual but having my mother's name makes me feel like I am nothing more than a clone. I look just like her as well. Not bad on that level considering my mom was, is, and always be a very good looking woman.  I am actually thinking about getting a legal name change.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I personally wouldn't do either. I guess people might give a different answer because it is more common to name boys after their fathers than girls after their mothers. Usually, the male names get passed down in families. I think a child deserves their own name. There are so many names out there, why not pick one different than your own? I think it would be very confusing too. My best friend was named after her mom and her brother after her dad. Half the time when I called to talk to her I would ask for her but get her mom instead!|`|aNGzulgpaa	Well, my mother and myself have the same middle name(Michele - with 1 L instead of 2) , and i also passed it on to my daughter.  And if i ever have a son, my husbands middle name is Jacob, and i would love to use that as a 1st name for my son.  But i dont like jr. names or having exactly the same name as a parent, you need your own identity.  Thats my opinion.  Hope it helps.|`|qv493CGiaa	I think its okay for boys to be named after their father (I have an uncle called Del who called his son Del who called his son Del - so overall 3 Del's :L) but i do think its strange for a mother and daughter to have the same name (just my opinion tbh)|`|0hxK0khKaa	1) Yes, it's tradition.<br>  <br>  2) No, it seems kinda weird.<br>  <br>  3) Because it's a tradition for a boy to be named after his father. It always will be. It isn't unfair, it's just family and honor.|`|f8epBxFOaa	my husband wants me to name the baby after him but i wont i just feel that everyone should have their own identity i think middle names are ok i am considering giving the baby his first name as a middle name|`|HBgnkltfaa	1)  Yes, it's okay for as son to be named after his father.  Though I can see how this could come off as essentially conceited, it's a traditional naming practice in our culture, so most people perceive it as very normal.  However, I personally wouldn't choose to pass on the father's entire name.  I much prefer it when the father's middle is used as the son's first name, or when the father's first or middle is used as the son's middle.<br>  <br>  2)  I do think it's okay for a daughter to be named after her mother, but it does strike me as strange to pass on the mother's entire first and middle name to her daughter.  However, I love the idea of giving the daughter a middle name after her mother or using the mother's middle name as the daughter's first name.<br>  <br>  3)  While I think it's "okay" in both instances, we'd be deceiving ourselves if we didn't acknowledge there is a difference in the way each instance is generally perceived in our culture.  We're so careful about not wanting to be "sexist", but if there weren't a general difference in the way these two naming practices are perceived, you wouldn't be asking this question!  I think the gender difference may be due to two factors:<br>  <br>  -- Our culture has traditionally been more patriarchal, with names being passed down through the male line.  While it might seem conceited to honor yourself in your child's name, in the case of a man naming his son after himself, most people will attribute it to tradition rather than vanity.  However, because it's not as traditional for a woman to name her daughter after herself, it's more likely that her motive will be interpreted as vanity.<br>  <br>  -- In our culture, some people view naming as the primary responsibility of the mother (since she is the one who gives birth to the child).  If a son is named after his father, this could be seen as the mother's decision to honor her husband.  People who might balk at someone trying to "honor herself" in choosing to name a daughter after herself might not have a problem with the mother honoring her husband in choosing to name a son after him.  (However, from what I've seen on baby name boards, it's usually the MEN who want to name sons after themselves -- most women wouldn't choose to have their son be a junior unless their husband insisted on it.)  As a side note, if the father were choosing the name all by himself (such as in a case where the mother died giving birth to the child), I wouldn't see it as strange at all to pass on the mother's entire name to the daughter.<br>  <br>  Naming isn't so much a question of "right" or "wrong" but what is perceived as culturally normal.  It's less culturally normal for a daughter to be given her mother's entire first and middle name.  But it may be perfectly normal in some cultures, and it certainly isn't bad or wrong.<br>  <br>  4)  I think it's special for children of both genders to have family names, whether they be from a parent, grandparent, or more distant ancestor.  I have the same middle name as my paternal grandmother (which just happened to be a version of my mother's first name), and I really like being connected to them in this way.  I plan to pass on my middle name to a daughter and my husband's middle name to a son.<br>  <br>  However, I personally would not give a son or daughter the same first name as my husband or me -- since names are used to distinguish between people, it makes sense to give them first names that are, well, distinct.<br>  <br>  Very interesting question!  You get a star!|`|AVYBazOEaa	Question 1) Do you think it's okay for a son to be named after his father?<br>  <br>  Nope<br>  <br>  Question 2) Do you think it's okay for a daughter to be named after her mother?<br>  <br>  Nope<br>  <br>  Question 3) If you gave different answers to the above questions, please explain why you feel gender makes a difference.<br>  <br>  Question 4) If you have the same answer, please explain why you are for or against kids being named after their parents in general.<br>  <br>  Because the confusion would be annoying and I don't see the point;- there are millions of different names out there :D|`|5Jy04RVKaa	I wouldn't personally name my son or daughter after its mother or father but I don't see anything 'wrong' with it, your name doesn't determine what you identity is or what personality you have, two people can have the same name and be opposites and I don't think that having the same name as a parent would affect a child's health or mental state in any negative way, its not significant to do so, the child may find it irritating that they have the same name but some people just don't like their name in general anyway. <br>      Also, I don't understand why people think its ok to name a child after its father but not its mother? maybe its just because the majority of parents in society name children after their father? but just because something is unusual that doesn't make it weird or wrong. I don't like that we have an inability to accept what is unusual. e.g. why is it out of honor for a child to be named after its father? tradition?...and vain for a child to be named after its mother? sexist? Why can't a child honor and respect its mother like its father?|`|z5olpY6gaa	1) Yes. But it can be confusing, so it's easier if the father's name is the middle name.<br>  <br>  2) Definitely. But as I said before, it might get confusing.|`|HMPdnhApaa	I would rather just give one of the parents' names as a middle name for the child b/c I don't like the jr. thing..|`|v5DaRgtKaa	nah|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I would only use a parents name as my child's middle name.  I'm not against either option you asked...that is just my personal preference.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	1 - yes <br>  2 - i dont know, IMO it comes off as a little vain<br>  3 - i feel that when a mother names her son OR daughter after the father [daughter if the father has a unisex name or something like that] its out of respect, honor, love, tradition, etc. but i just feel as though a mother naming her daughter OR son after herself its a little vain in my opinion, i guess it could be different if it was like a family middle name or something...i dont know its just my preference. i think its better for a mother to name her children after someone else than herself if she wants to name them after somebody.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Yes, I do-if that is what the parents want to do.<br>  My son is Randal Allen Braxton, II.  We used Roman Numerals instead of Jr. because we liked it better.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do-if that is what the parents want to do.<br>  I know people that have done this.  My oldest daughter is "sort of" named after me-her name is a combination of her father and I's name.<br>  <br>  Gender makes no differenc.e<br>  <br>  Parents are able to name their children as they please.  For some families, it is tradition.  My children think their names are pretty cool.  My son LOVES having the same name as his father.<br>  <br>  So, if the parents want to do it, it is fine for me-no matter the gender.  If they do not want to do it, that is fine also-just do not insult others for naming their children as they see fit.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	1. Yes as long as the go by jr. and you both like the name!<br>  <br>  2. Yes I do once again same as 1<br>  <br>  3. I didn't and I do not feel that gender makes a difference<br>  <br>  4. I am for it because it is a way to keep a family tradition started and or going! I would rather use the first name as the middle name on a kid though because I think that it would get too confusing and everything.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I think it's up to the parents. I know families who've done both (1 and 2). And I don't have an issue with it.

VGij9p0Taa	Congrats! <br>  Firstly I'd like to say that your twins names are really cute. Love Lilly Rae. Hm, Melinda May is okay not too sure about that one, but Jaylon Samual is fine however prefer the original spelling of the middle name which is Samuel that is so much better. The name Samuel is awesome. <br>  Suggestions:- <br>  Boys... <br>  Jacob meaning held by the heel is a great name. Jacob Samuel <br>  Kai meaning man of the sea is a good trendy name. Kai Samuel<br>  Girls... <br>  Alexis meaning defending mankind is cool. Alexis May or Alexis Rose<br>  Vivienne meaning alive a very classy name. Vivienne May or Grace<br>  Hope this helps!|`|bUcWxQqpaa	kacio (guy) & kalia (lady)<br>  kay-see-oh / kah-lee-ah|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Melinda May Singer isn't bad but I like Meagan Beth Singer.

6LxXR61Waa	Hmm.  Well, we are kinda in the same boat.  My LMP was also on Feb. 14.  Which would usually mean ovulation around Feb. 27.  If you had sex on the 26th, then MAYBE your cramps on the 27th were from ovulation.  They would be too soon to have symptoms from implantation, etc. as that takes 6-12 days after sex.  Because you had diarrhea, I would guess that maybe your cramps were from something you ate, etc.<br>  <br>  The timing for the "spotting" is also off, unless for some reason you ovulated around Feb 20th.<br>  <br>  The sore boobs and exhaustion are definitely signs of early pregnancy, but could also be caused by something else.<br>  <br>  My guess would be that you're not pregnant, but it's just a guess.  Won't know until you test.<br>  <br>  By the way, the "pull-out method" is not a form of birth control.  There are sperm/semen even before the guy finishes.
P544Sbmqaa	Cord blood really isnt used for blood transfusions.  For the most part, cord blood is used for the stem cells in it.|`|3p0QBNpwaa	No, Your brother will only be able to receive O- blood.
IAVRavfiaa	You're most likely not pregnant, sorry to have to be the bearer of bad news. <br>  <br>  I had my Implanon in for 11 1/2 months & got it taken out January 27 because I had irregular bleeding i.e. I would only get a period once every 3-4 months (which was GREAT, since mine were always horribly painful), but when I finally got it , it lasted a full month. I had weird cramps & almost every pregnancy symptom there is when I got it removed, & I even got one of the VERY rare false + (confirmed by my OB/GYN). I didn't get my post-implanon period until February 18 & it lasted till the 25, so it was normal. Now I'm just hoping that I am able to catch my ovulation days in time.. <br>  <br>  It might be different for you though, considering you only had it in for 6 weeks vs. my 11 1/2 months; it all depends on how your body reacts to the lack of hormones. <br>  <br>  But, on the bright side, I've read about women not getting a period after they get it taken out, & come to find out they fell pregnant as early as 5 days to a week..<br>  <br>  So good luck & TONS of baby dust to you!!
a1ymHaWAaa	no your body actually makes it own anesthetic when the head comes through.however if you get torn that really hurts afterwards from them sewing you back up and is very painful.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Yes they do. No, they are not at all necessary. It's much better to tear naturally and heal that get cut and have stitches. This practice is outdated and dangerous. Just make sure your doc knows you DO NOT want one and make sure someone like your husband or a doula who is with you at delivery is there to remind them and keep them from doing it.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i read that over the years they found out that it's better not to have it done bc majority of the time women don't tear as much as episiotomy, therefore they heal faster from natural tear.<br>  <br>  and ur age doesn't matter, it all depends on ur body and tissue elasticity really.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_episiotomy_165.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_episiotomy_1...</a>|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Whether you are numb during birth or not, it'll hurt after. Episiotomies are done far to often, and according to all the OB's and nurses I talked to it's far better to tear. Think of it this way: what's stronger, something zipped together (tear) or something with straight edges sewed together? And episiotomies can turn into awful tears. I actually didn't know I tore until after when I was being sewn up.<br>  <br>  ETA- you can have your perineum massaged before and during birth with oils to help it stretch naturally. You can ask your birth partner to help during birth, and you can try to diy before. If you can, watch House of Babies- it's a show about midwives and the families they help.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	My mom's did not hurt but she was numb from the epidural. Yes, you are awake.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	umm yes i didnt have an epi but he numbed me <br>  the pain after words <br>  ahh|`|AA10015577	I tore to my anus and didn't even feel it, I don't recall how many stitches I needed but the healing process wasn't as bad as I thought.  I was too busy pushing my son's big head out when it happened.  Tearing is better for the healing process because it is natural.  I didn't want to have an episiotomy, so the doctor just tried to stretch things in the perenial area in between pushes.  You should read up on it to see if you may want to tear or be cut (if need be).  Good luck hun!<br>  <br>  Edit-You can try to massage the perineal area with olive oil to help improve elasticity there.  Use the forefinger and middle finger (it's better if your partner helps) slightly using pressure, insert to the first knuckle and go back and forth (side to side).  Age doesn't matter either.|`|apALY0sqaa	I wouldn't think so, you are numb and it's a tiny cut. But, one of my good friends didn't get one in time. She ended up tearing from literally where the episiotomy should have been to her rectum. It was a long and very painful tear- and took alot longer to recover from than the tiny cut they should have made in the first place.<br>  <br>  There is some recovery time, and you have to avoid a bath till it heals. It's a little uncomfortable to sit and move a day or so I hear, and it might hurt to pee a day or so- but it's not so bad. I know the hospital gave my friend something for pain.<br>  <br>  They can sometimes be necessary- if baby gets stuck in the birth canal, or is too large to pass. To help avoiding getting one, perineal massage can help. You can to it yourself, or have your partner do it- if you have a sexdrive, a little lube can make it sexy and let it lead to other things. I don't know if age has anything to do with it, but the number of babies a woman has vaginally may have something to do with it. the friend I told you about just had number 2- without tearing or an episiotomy.|`|mhvoPAOCaa	you can massage your perineum with oil throughout your pregnancy.  Also if delivering vaginally, when the head is starting to come out, they tell you not to push (ring of fire) instead let it stretch slowly.  Tears and episotomys hurt a bit afterwards, everything is swollen down there. I had a small tear, I didnt have any kind of spinal block or epidural..just a shot of demerol, there was so much happening at the moment that I never even knew about it.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I also read up on them and had decided I didn't want one done....I talked about it with my OB, and we decided it wouldn't be preformed.  Fast forward to labor.....the baby was starting to tear me on the way out, so the doctor decided to do the episiotomy.  I don't think it hurt....i had an epidural.  But even with the epidural, EVERYTHING still hurt down there in the last half-hour of pushing.....was it the episiotomy that hurt?  or jsut the stretching that hurt?  or the contractions?  or the baby?  I don't think i could separate any of it out.  I will say, that i didn't know i had an episiotomy until it was over.  Oh, i was 32 when i delivered my baby|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I had one done right before my daughters head came into the world. I didn't feel it at all, altho I had an epidural done. <br>  I guess it would just depend on if you are medicated or not. And yes you are awake because they ONLY do it if they are in fear of you tearing when you are pushing your baby into the world.

88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	"Bed-wetting up to the age of 6 is not unusual, even though it may be frustrating to parents."<br>  This is form the info below. This is sooooo common with sound sleepers but most people don't talk about it.

Having them wear panties during potty-training is one thing, but for bedwetting it won't help.<br>  <br>  It's so great you are so supportive of your daughter and her feelings! :)<br>  <br>  "What causes bed-wetting?<br>  <br>  Some of the causes of bed-wetting include the following:<br>  <br>      * Genetic factors (it tends to run in families)<br>      * Difficulties waking up from sleep<br>      * Stress<br>      * Slower than normal development of the central nervous system (which reduces the child's ability to stop the bladder from emptying at night)<br>      * Hormonal factors (not enough antidiuretic hormone is produced, which is the hormone that slows urine production at night)<br>      * Urinary tract infections<br>      * Abnormalities in the urethral valves in boys or in the ureter in girls or boys<br>      * Abnormalities in the spinal cord<br>      * A small bladder<br>  <br>  Bed-wetting is not a mental or behavior problem. It doesn't happen because the child is too lazy to get out of bed to go to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Children achieve bladder control at different ages. By the age of 6 years, most children no longer urinate in their sleep. Bed-wetting up to the age of 6 is not unusual, even though it may be frustrating to parents. Treating a child for bed-wetting before the age of 6 is not usually necessary."|`|DDIBEvUTaa	I've heard that putting them in regular undies helps.  They'll wet the bed a few times, but eventually get better.  Also maybe you could try waking her at different times for a few nights til you can find when she is naturally in a "light" sleep cycle so maybe she won't be so confused?|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	My son had this problem when he was 2-1/2 to about 4 and 2 months. I used two pull ups on him at night one facing backwards and one facing forwards. Then I put down a cloth diaper under him while he slept. It worked!|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, im sorry to say this but sometimes theres not really anything you can do. Maybe you could try talking to your doctor. <br>  I know i had a causin that actually had to wear pull ups until he was 12. He was a very hard sleeper as well and could never get himself to wake up during the night. He obviously was embarassed like crazy about the situation so we never told anyone and it kept him from sleeping at a friends house sometimes too, but he would do anything to avoid the secret getting out and i understand perfectly. Its hard on a persons moral to have to go through that because of something they cant control. Luckily, for most, it normally stops early. But some people, it can go on for a long time. Not to be discouraging, but im just saying it like it is. I understand what she is going through and i really hope for her sake that it ends soon, but maybe you could try talking to her doctor for advise. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Edit: like the people above said, maybe getting her up at a specific time every night to take her to the bathroom could help. Its going to be kind of like an alarm : always waking up at 11pm to go pee. Eventually, it might become an automatic reflex to wake up at this time (kind of like when you set up your alarm in the morning for work.. i know alot of people wake up before it because they are just used to it. Maybe that could work for your daughter as well...)|`|ONIa9Z17aa	I worked with a child once who's mother got him an electronic sensor that fitted into his underclothes. Once it got wet, it beeped and woke him. In a relatively short time the problem was resolved. I don't know where she got it tho, but my guess would be a pharmacy. If it's loud enough to wake your child it might work for you.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Try not putting her in pull ups and just use panties. Maybe feeling it on herself may help her wake up during the night to go. If you try this you will want to get a plastic cover for her mattress.|`|tShDXmgbaa	Just keep getting her up atleast once during the night and take her to the bathroom.  I'd rather my child be a little confused when taken to the bathroom versus her feeling ashamed because she wet herself.  That would make me feel bad as well knowing I could prevent this by simple taking her to the bathroom. If you know it bothers her being wet...why not get her up and take her to the potty???
JMBT0LSUaa	Kinda slutty if you ask me!|`|8XURx7nzaa	NO!! you should wait please sex has alot of emotional feelings that come with it & you may not be able to handle it. plus you have to think of the consquences pregnancies std's stuff like that it is better just to wait trust me in the long run you will be happy that you did!|`|iAfmejYTaa	sure. its up to that person|`|zjuMrDmGaa	No, it isn't.

Fh4B88ZGaa	There are lots of things that could cause you to be late. Wait another week and test again- if it's still negative and you still don't have your period, call your doctor and see what they advise you to do.
470df787f673f05236eb38b31db30cd5aa	I would say that you are just having side effects of being sick.  I have 3 children and can tell you from experience that you probably wouldn't be suffering from morning sickness so quickly, you had your period which you usually do not have if you are pregnant, and a woman is most fertile AFTER her period, not before.  You have a period to shed unused eggs after they breakdown, and then after that the new "ripe" eggs are available.  I think, but might be wrong, you are usually most fertile 10-14 days after your period.  <br>  <br>  I think you are just sick, and lots of illnesses are going around.  Just keep an eye on yourself.  I never had a sore throat, runny nose, cold, etc just from being pregnant.<br>  <br>  I had tender breasts even before knowing I was pregnant...breasts that REALLY hurt even to touch.  I think that's the most common side effect of early pregnany.  At least it was for me.|`|Jv0IHEABaa	Sounds like you just got a cold, not that your pregnant.  You can always take a pregnancy test to make yourself feel better but if you had your period, you should be fine.
7197926738c6345db095d2af690ca509aa	Take a pregnancy test. It will put to rest your worries. Or it might just prolong your worry by 9 months.|`|AA11612672	But the commercials show it as being so wonderful...
rDPADat1aa	If you're on birth control, why do you think you're pregnant?  It's 99% effective.  I would say the brown spotting proves you're about to start your period so no need to retest.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	take the test after you miss your period. if your trying to get pregnant stop taking your pills|`|ViK719Gkaa	Be sure you use protection or at least be sure he slides out before climax. You could also service him with your mouth, or hand. <br>  <br>  Just be careful! You do not want a child until your married. Not necessarily for your sake but for the child.|`|Gu2E2guZaa	If you're unsure, retest using your first urine of the day in a couple of days.

You would just need to explain to them you're reasons for going elsewhere.  I wouldn't go back to the free salon either!!!!  good luck
F3iEnj2Caa	I read an article about this in seventeen magazine (: <br>  <br>  Tips: <br>  1. Doodling and Drawing! While your teachers are talking, try drawing whatever comes  to your mind, BUT dont wander off too much.  You can even try to make doodles related to the notes you are taking. It will help your grade.<br>  <br>  2. Eat a mint or candy. The minty taste is supposed to stimulate your brain and makes it easier to concentrate. The candy will keep you from getting hungry so that your hunger doesnt distract you. <br>  <br>  3. Try relating whatever subject you are learning in school to something that is going on in your life. It will make it more interesting.<br>  <br>  4.  In between classes, try to spend as much time with your friends as possible and have fun. It will keep the day interesting and you will have something to look foward, too. <br>  <br>  5.  Get involved and participate in class. As lame as it may sound, when you pay attention and do work in class it actually goes by faster.  It givese you something to focus on besides the time.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	DON'T stare at the clock, it makes things worse.<br>  <br>  Doodle, it's supposed to help stimulate the brain.<br>  Think about how you're almost done with HS :]<br>  <br>  Awww, a thumbs down, I feel loved, but I have proof of doodling helping the mind.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7912671.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/791267...</a>|`|ejelObdJaa	i talk a LOT. try to do all my work. & be always hyperr. & for some reason it always go by VERY quick :]|`|eYtZpd6gaa	people she is a junior IN high school not in junior high. sorry it was bothering me but anyways<br>  <br>  I have the same problem.

What do you think???|`|ArkvdaPoaa	Pregnancy symptoms do not usually occur that quickly.  You are probably experiencing these syptoms because you are thinking about it too much.  But if you did have intercourse on those days than you could in fact be pregnant.
ROJans2Taa	theres a small chance but I really wouldn't worry, you were obviously near the end of your cycle, and while yes some do ovulate then, its a small few.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	you should be ok. if you got your period. normally you would need to actually have sex to get pregnant.|`|tht0DrHsaa	No your are fine.  If you guys are doing this kind of act sex will be soon to follow.  You need to make sure that you are using protection every time.  How old are you?  You sound pretty young so I hope you will please wait.   You don't want to be on here in a few months saying " Help I am pregnant."|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	well you got your period so it didn't have any effect but in future make sure he has no semen on his hands if he does and then touches you there is a slight chance you could get pregnant|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It is not very likely that you would get pregnant from this. Especially if you got your period 2 days later.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Not likely but not impossible. Stop worrying about it now. You are safe.|`|kYeeoS6Baa	Don't worry honey.<br>  I am pretty sure you are safe.<br>  Since you  got your period on time there is nothing to worry about.<br>  But in the future never ever get semen near your vagina again without protection. Even if he wipes his hands !!!<br>  Remember all it is needs is one tiny drop and one sperm in that tiny drop ,if you are on the right day of of your cycle.<br>  Pre-*** / semen also may contain sperm so be extra careful.<br>  Have fun and play safe.
qIHTmouhaa	I do have to say it was pretty easy transitioning my baby from a bottle to a sippy cup. When I did first start trying to get him off of the formula I would give him formula throughout the day and for his very last bottle I gave him 8 oz's and 2 of that would be whole milk the other 6 would be formula and I just kept upping it ever week until the whole bottle was whole milk. Then I started giving him half formula and half milk in a sippy cup and from there it was pretty simple. You just have to do it gradually and make sure that if you and someone else are giving him his bottles/sippy cups they know about how much to mix otherwise it could throw him completely off.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I only had to mix the two for about a week, and then she was fine with whole milk.  I started giving her whole milk just after her first birthday.  She was also completely off bottles by the time she was 14 months.  The younger they are, the easier it is to switch them off bottles.|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	My little daughter is 13 months. I still bottle feed her with formula S-26.

Sometimes, some rice and fish and fruits.|`|0iiTpHKaaa	I started giving my son whole milk at 12 months and only in a sippy cup. If you have a skinny baby, I would say keep giving him formula for a month or so until he catches up. Bottles are for babies and unless he really needs it, I wouldn't give him one after he's a year old. At one, my son didn't care how he got his milk, just as long as he got it at least three to four times a day (8oz, of course).|`|LfDfkbgWaa	he shouldn't get whole milk tell one year old. as for mixing them together i have never heard of that being done.

XqJZ8nnxaa	well for one thing, sometimes when your a teenager to young 20's the periods can be all screwed up if your on birth control and have sex, or just having sex itself.. it's not a bad thing.. but it sometimes just messes it up.. but i would refrain from drinking or smoking for a little while even if you take a test and it is negative.. because sometimes it is hard to show up in the younger stages of pregnancy.. well good luck hun!.. and if you have any further questions my email is johannahseymour@ymail.com have a great day hun!|`|U1I2vEM9aa	You would be about 4 weeks along.  They judge the time by the first day of your last period.  Although the first couple months are the moth crucial for development, many people do not know until 6 weeks or beyond that they are pregnant.  Drinking and smoking up until this point should not have effects on the embryo.  But don't drink or smoke until you know for sure!  I started getting symptoms before I even missed my period, like a overly watery mouth, and a constant "carsick" feeling.  A lot of people don't get symptoms until 6 weeks and beyond!   It is not too early for a PG test.  I took one and got a strong positive days before I missed my period.  Although you can get a false negative, you can NOT get a false positive. Take a test and then wait a few days and test again if negative.  Test only in the morning when you wake up. Levels are highest.  Good luck with everything! xoxo|`|TFuCMwUWaa	Definatley take a test, if your period is late there is a good chance.  If you had your last period a month ago you would be about 4+ weeks along now.  Take a test, call your doc, start taking prenatals if you are, and best of luck to you.
x1BSDVFmaa	You should get it checked out at the doctors first,|`|552DEFgvaa	GO TO THE DOCTOR!!!!!!! u have to go to the doctor to be mind safe and u have to talk with ur bf about that GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!
3ymsCAPhaa	Hi There! I'm 7 weeks pregnant with my second, too! Go us! Every pregnancy is different. I was so lucky with my first, never had too many discomforts or morning sickness at all. Oh man, this time I have every symptom in the book! Are you very petite? The less maternal fat layers the growing uterus has to hide behind, the sooner the show, and it is a real possibility that you might be showing already! My first suggestion was going to be maybe water retention or bowel distention (constipation) but if you are sure it is neither of those, it may be your growing uterus with baby inside! Whether or not they give you an ultrasound this early depends on your doc and possibly your insurance, I've heard of many women getting their first as early as 5 to 6 weeks along! I was hoping my OBGYN would order me one so that we can get that heart beating...I had a miscarriage last time and am nervous! Anyway, if they do give you one *Crosses fingers for you* they will be able to tell if it's twins! They will see two gestational sacs  and two hearts beating away! One sign of twins is exaggerated morning sickness, like all of your symptoms being waaay worse than a normal pregnancy. They can tell through blood work too cause the pregnancy hormones will be much higher if you have two babies in there. Soo weird I stumbled on your question, I was wondering about twins too because I've been feeling pretty awful. Good luck at your first appt. Mine is on monday. I am having trouble sleeping this early too and from everything I've read it's completely normal! Well, good luck and I hope I helped! I'm so excited for you! I hope you have a happy, healthy pregnancy and you get to feelin' better soon.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	There are no real signs you are having twins. You just have to wait and see if they see 2 hearteats. That IS strange that you are already showing at 7-8 weeks. I've never heard of that even for twins.|`|f0otK4zQaa	usually with second child everything progresses much quicker, could be a big baby, could be a dating error ? ultrasound at 12 wk will see whats going on. hope all goes well|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I started showing with number 2 around 8 weeks also and my son had just turned 1.  I looked like I was 5 months along.  It is common to show sooner with subsequent pregnancies especially when they are close together.  Trouble sleeping has nothing to do with gender or number of fetuses.  There are really no signs of twins.  They will do an internal if you are less than 10 weeks.|`|mhvoPAOCaa	<a href="http://pregnancy.emedtv.com/pregnancy-week-by-week/8-weeks-pregnant-p2.html" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.emedtv.com/pregnancy-we...</a><br>  <br>  great link for you..your uterus is about the size of an orange and if it is your second child, due to the muscles and ligament already being stretched, you will be showing earlier.  Not necessarily twins tho.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I started showing at week 5 but am also pregnant with triplets.  <br>  They only way to know for sure is to have an ultrasound. It would definitely be vaginally this early.  I have read that women start showing a lot earlier if they have had a child before.  Good luck at your appt!
oHNrktxTaa	You could still be pregnant, however your hcg levels may not be high enough right now for your HPT to read. I suggest you wait another day or so & retest in the morning. If still a negative & no sign of your period, I would call your OBYN & make an appointment to have a blood test done.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	IF YOU HAVE SEX, YOU COULD BE PREGNANT.<br>  TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST AND FIND OUT, OR GO TO THE DOCTORS AND GET A BLOOD TEST.<br>  <br>  All caps are annoying, by the way.

oilECbKkaa	just think of it this way, it's never to early to start buying things for the baby... this way you can start your stock on formula and diapers before your baby arrives. it'll save you a lot of money in the long run!!! plus don't forget the baby showers!! get things for free! best kind of baby showers are the ones where you receive lots and lots of diapers!!! it's getting expensive out there.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I just bought little things here and there and then about a month before the baby I got everything and then would just get more here and there.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	ok well you can start now, cause i plan on buying things when i find out the sex of the baby.|`|NCvX4I0baa	I'm 35 weeks and I haven't bought much but baby bottles. I've been stocking up on clothing and blankets that people have given me. I think I'm planning to go buy things in one or two more weeks considering the fact that people are going to give me more than half of what the baby will need.<br>  <br>  You should buy gender neutral stuff and shop a little. Then wait after your baby shower if you're having one so you don't end up buying what your friends and family already got for you.<br>  <br>  & don't stock up on diapers yet. You have to wait until the baby is here to decide whether if the diaper fits and is good for the baby or not.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|HPRlEWu1aa	im 16 weeks and we havent bought anything .. were gonna go find out the gender 2day ... our baby shower is when im like 23 weeks cuz thats the only time i could take leave to travel across country . so when i come back and know what i already got, ill be going shopping :O)|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I think we started after 20 weeks.

You should start buying little things here and there. I don't recommed you buy all boy stuff cuz at 15 weeks its hard to know the sex of the baby and you don't wana end up with a bunch of boy stuff( just in case). <br>  <br>  <br>  also you want to wait for your baby shower cuz u might get all the good stuff !|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I started buying neutral baby items at 13 weeks since I had passed the "first trimester danger" stage.

This possible sign of pregnancy is often what causes women to search for more details about the other pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  Some women might only experience a much lighter period compared to their usual. You might not experience any of the pregnancy signs listed below until around the time you notice you've missed your monthly cycle.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #2<br>  <br>  Just "Feeling" Pregnant<br>  <br>  This early pregnancy symptom may be the reason why you are checking this list right now. Many women believe they have an intuition about pregnancy signs. Their intuition is often proven correct.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel different; tired, moody, queasy, lightheaded. You may also have heartburn, constipation, or find yourself making more frequent trips to the restroom. Perhaps you feel a dull ache or stiffness in your lower back, you have sore breasts or they seem overly sensitive, or you are simply not feeling like your usual self.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #3<br>  <br>  Breast Tenderness<br>  <br>  One of the very noticeable early signs of pregnancy is tender, swollen, somewhat sore breasts. You may notice this pregnancy sign at bedtime when you are trying to get comfortable and go to sleep, when exercising or showering, or when getting dressed.<br>  <br>  When you become pregnant, your body begins preparing your breasts for producing milk and breastfeeding. Hormones start increasing. In addition to breast tenderness and swelling, your nipples may feel sore or extra sensitive. Some women notice their nipples darken in color.<br>  <br>  Your breasts play an important role in childbirth. They are naturally sensitive and become far more so when pregnant. This is one of the most obvious early symptoms of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #4<br>  <br>  Fatigue<br>  <br>  One of the earliest pregnancy signs for some women may be fatigue and exhaustion. You may start going to bed sooner, or find it harder than usual to get out of bed in the morning. If you are working, by noon you may feel like you need to lie down. Exercising seems like too much effort. A simple activity like shopping may leave you feeling wiped out and lightheaded. This early pregnancy symptom is caused by all of the changes that your body is going through, plus the increasing levels of hormones.<br>  <br>  If you know you are pregnant, try to take frequent rests or naps of 15 minutes to a half-hour whenever possible. Explain to your family, friends and coworkers that you need these naps. Ask for their help in blocking out rest times for you.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #5<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination<br>  <br>  An early symptom of pregnancy that others may notice you experiencing is frequent trips to the restroom. Your family or friends may comment that you seem to be going off to the ladies room quite often lately. One cause of this pregnancy symptom is that the swelling uterus can put pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy causes extra body fluids to be processed by your kidneys and bladder. That means more trips to the restroom. Sorry to have to say this, but this symptom of pregnancy may remain constant for nine months.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #6<br>  <br>  Nausea<br>  <br>  One of these pregnancy signs of queasiness, nausea and vomiting can take you by surprise when you least expect it. These early pregnancy symptoms may come as soon as a week into the pregnancy. Many women experience nausea in the morning when they have coffee and/or eat something on an empty stomach. This is known as morning sickness (see below). Other women notice nausea in the afternoon or evening. Others feel queasy all day.<br>  <br>  This pregnancy symptom may often be helped by eating smaller, more frequent snack size meals. Many women say saltine crackers and milk seem to be helpful. This is an early symptom of pregnancy that seems to show up about a month after pregnancy has begun. It tends to level off once you are into your second trimester and your body adjusts to all the many changes it is going through.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #7<br>  <br>  Dizziness and/or Fainting<br>  <br>  One of the more surprising pregnancy signs is dizziness and/or fainting. Going up stairs, standing up suddenly after sitting for a time, or just having to stand in line at the grocery store can make you feel light headed. You might even faint. As the uterus swells it compresses arteries in your legs. This can drop your blood pressure and make you dizzy.<br>  <br>  A common early sign of pregnancy is that you may feel faint when you have gone a while without eating. This is due to low blood sugar, because that is your baby's main source of food. You want to eat frequent, healthy snacks to keep your blood sugar up. Stock up on portable lunch box foods you can take with you. Such as apples, bananas, grapes, yogurt cups, carrots and celery, cheese and crackers, small cartons of milk, juice boxes, granola bars, boxes o|`|BO28Mn8haa	i'm still not sure if i am or not but if i am, my symptoms are spotting period, achy feelings, tired and headaches. also a weird flushed sensation in my stomach|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	you get them when you start drowin up and you fell sleepy and you start gainin weight and that happens arouond the first week or the days after you done had sick or it will come up  on u around the 1st week or the 1st month|`|ksvl0bWWaa	I think it's not having your period and it happens right away.|`|9JccdA9Uaa	Your first symptoms of pregnancy? Gee. Symptoms are harder to tell. When your getting your period you feel bloated, crampy, breasts are tender. Its kind of the same when you are pregnant. Not usually the cramping but there are times when you can. But your missed period should be your first clue. Then you take a preg test.
56q4sy3Haa	It might have been your period, but if you did have unprotected sex, it's possible that this was a chemical pregnancy. <br>  Read this for more info<br>  <a href="http://www.womens-health.co.uk/chemical.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.womens-health.co.uk/chemical....</a>|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Sounds like you had your period.  If you're still worried though, take a pregnancy test.|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Take a pregnancy test just to see. I had the same thing happen to me. I started having brown disharge when I was supposed to start my period so I popped in a tampon and after like 4 days I realized, this is not a period. So I took a test and it came up positive, so take a test to see is ur pregnant. Good luck!
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Definitely sounds like labour is on its way!!! Rythmic pains at a good interval apart is a sign of early labor. <br>  To help get things really moving, I would do some walking, clean up the house. Stay on your feet for a little while. That should help get the contractions closer together, and get you closer to having your little baby. <br>  Congratulations in advance!!!|`|UBGSFW7maa	congrats|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Yes, I think they're labor pains.  Do something active, and they will get stronger.|`|1Qxe2Sjhaa	Congratulations! At 39 weeks it definitely sounds like true labor. Although it could be just Braxton Hicks contractions preparing your body for labor. My advice as a mother of 6 would be to rest up while you can. They call it "labor" for a reason:) However, by this point you are probably ready to have your body back and let little junior sleep in the crib...if that's the case, walking and spicy foods really helped me. P.S. If you have had alot of heartburn/indigestion during the pregnancy, forget the spicy food..it will only cause more discomfort during labor. Again, CONGRATULATIONS!|`|I6qfoJaiaa	Could be, go for a walk, eat and drink something. True labor will only get stronger so remember to rest now.
GjpWEu6Raa	homeless lady ?<br>  <br>  my 5year old wants to take all the dogs she see's home <br>  <br>  <br>  EVEN THE ONES STILL ON A LEAD WITH THEIR OWNERS <br>  <br>  <br>  just make sure your daughter & mine never meet dan we'd never get into our homes if they did lol|`|AA11327039	Maybe you can bring her a box of food and some juices.  Things that won't perish but things she can keep in her hiding places to last awhile and be nutritious.  She sounds like a very kind child.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	They sure do.My 3 year old cousin said the f-word on his last birthday.Another cousin and I burst out laughing our asses off.The face on all the adults were priceless.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	What a sweet little girl you have. I hope that she stays as non judgemetal as she is right now.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Dan,you're lucky to have such a daughter.By the way,does your daughter follow football?|`|0dTXkBopaa	haha<br>  so did u bring her home?|`|eUuFPJAFaa	LOL thats so sweet bless her :)<br>  <br>  My little man is 2 soon and his speech is just getting right. He's just learnt to say "luff you" which is so cute. But his big thing at the moment is lorries - you cannot walk down the road without him finding one (even if it's actually a van hehe). He even knows the sound and the other day his Dad was asking him how has his day been, was he a good boy and he just went "Lorry out there daddy LORRY!!" :)|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	Dan you must be very proud of her , she sounds like a little cutie , many years ago when i was married we were having a barbie and i asked my daughter would she like a hot dog she told me not to be cruel to dogs , i still laugh at it , that was about 25 years ago|`|wUQ51VBdaa	Awww bless her!!! My son is also 4 and when we go into town we see a homeless old man playing his guitar and he always always wants to give them some pennies and wants to stop to talk!! Ha ha.

X x|`|8d32360b2ae46f54d5979a019fc43955aa	yeah, its little things like that that make you wish people weren't so judgemental and brought up with such fears or prejudices --> you've got a open-minded young girl there, i hope she safely stays that way x.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	awww that is so sweet, i first i thought it was gonna be an insult, but you daughter is so thoughtful, you should be well proud x|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Awww...<br>  <br>  They also have some funny and embarassing things to say too!|`|OD3FqMaKaa	she sounds like a lovely little girl, how sweet :0)|`|50lIaC8zaa	Ahhhh, what a lovely little girl you have. x|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Aw, that story brightened up my day.  Children are so open-minded and innocent.  It's such a sad thing the world teaches them to grow up and be surly old adults like us eh?  No matter how much we try to keep them innocent.<br>  <br>  I took my daughter shopping at a thrift store and we saw a very large coat some lady picked up and it just fit the lady just right and my daughter (Giada) turns around and said (extremely loudly), "Mom!  Look at that coat! Two of me and two of you could fit in that together!"<br>  <br>  I just wanted to die.|`|xHlcnkgWaa	hahaha that's funny, embarassing but funny.  For ages my dad had been saying to my son when he first started talking a few months ago, "say grandad, grandad, say grandad".  My son pointed to my dad and said "dinosaur" it was priceless....lol|`|CFFuFof1aa	That is very sweet. Sounds like you are teaching her the right way. Believe me though, they grow up and get hormonal in the teenage years and they turn in to smarty pants, LOL.|`|jPwPczodaa	lol thats cute!|`|WdOAxQmoaa	my sister is very greatfull for the sweet mate. ;). lol joke.<br>  <br>  <br>  good wee girl you have there.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Not entirely sure about the spotting, but the cramps and ovulation feeling is normal after your period.  Most women complain about it for a week and then your ovulation is on it's way usually.  I experience those symptoms after I have my period and it always confused me too!<br>  <br>  I mean. . . some women can ovulate sooner then planned. . .so you MAY be ovulating sooner, but I highly doubt it.  =)|`|yp9rEMSraa	Do you have regular periods?  I have irregular periods and it seems my ovulation changes from month to month....You could be ovulating but it is unlikely....or doesnt seem like it to me....

Alexander is my youngest son's middle name, but we always called him Michael (not Mike or Mikey). My oldest son was the 3rd (named after myself & my father). We called him "Trey".

5saz2WV0aa	i had an emergency c-section because of preclampsia. one minute i was just there for a regular checkup with my doctor telling me my pregnancy was one of the ones he liked with no complications and i was a good patient following all his rules.. then he takes my pressure and says hmm... ur pressure is a bit high.... a BIT?! an hour later they were already operating. i was already seeing flashing lights so he was afraid i would start convulsing at any moment. <br>  I saw my son.. and they took him away and i didn't see him again until 24 hours later because i was in the ICU with my pressure still all over the place. <br>  Then when i was in a regular room and still had not seen my son, my husband's aunt who already had seen AND held him says and i quote "he is adorable, you two make beautiful babies together... you can start on baby #2"...|`|tkSXjqhuaa	i still act crazy sometimes............. its been 6 months.<br>  <br>  i had no idea what to expect, and it was really fast. my water broke in Denny's at 11pm, and Brayden was out by 2am. I didn't even have an epidural, it all went soo fast. By the end I was just confused and worrying if he was okay, because he was born 2 months early.|`|COecrPrMaa	While I was in the hospital I did.  I was so nervous.  I was so scared of something going wrong.  I wanted to hold her all the time and I freaked out when they came and took her to the nursery.  I didn't sleep a wink the entire three days.  I wasn't even sleepy because of my anxiety, I suppose.  I stayed in the hall at the nursery.  I remember getting so scared that something was wrong and they wouldn't tell me because they kept putting her under the incubator light.  It was my first time, I really didn't know anything about giving birth.  I also remember when they came in and said "You are fully dilated, you are ready" and they rolled in this big shiny metal table with a million different shiny metal tools and I was there on the bed with an epidural and couldn't even sit up right.  I clearly remember saying to the nurse when I saw the metal table... "No the f*ck I'm not!"<br>  <br>  I remember the feelings I had, the worries and everything else... but thinking back on it, it is like flashes in bits and pieces.  It happened so fast and everything was new and scary... but I can't wait to do it again!|`|rjVALevtaa	I went out of my mind after giving birth to my first son! They let me hold him for an hour then took him away for about 3-4 hours (and they had told me it would only be 2 hours). I was crying and I was alone. All I could think of was that I wanted my baby back! It was terrible.<br>  <br>  After giving birth to my second son, I was just glad to be done with it! I had a pretty difficult (but very quick) labor. They took him away immediately after, so by the time they brought him back I was just happy to see him again. <br>  <br>  I didn't really go crazy until we brought him home, then I was completely stressed out! Taking care of 2 kids was a big adjustment for me, as I'm sure it is for all moms. I was definitely crazy, although I'm not sure how funny it was!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Mine isn't funny as such. I had an epidural, couldn't feel my contractions so (and this is tmi) I couldn't feel her coming out, nor did I know she'd been delivered. You saw my answer to that other question lol, I genuinely couldn't see her and I was so confused. One minute she was "still in there", for lack of a better phrase, then suddenly she was there. Cos I couldn't feel anything, it took a while to accept that she was there.... if that makes sense? I was also out of it cos of G&A.... so that might've had something to do with it lol.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I didn't feel out of it at all.

oAcJPS98aa	When my mother was born, she was the 8th daughter.  My poor grandmother had run out of girls names.  A week later, a nun suggested that she name my mother "Denise" after St. Denis whose feast day was Oct 9, same as my mother's birthday.<br>  <br>  Consequently, my middle name is Denise.  There was a pretty song in the 60's or 70's <br>  <br>   "Denise, Denise, oh with your eyes so blue,<br>    Denise, Denise, I've got a crush on you. ..."<br>  <br>  That is my Denise trivia for you!

sDdgyyXbaa	My sister has just given birth to a baby girl but during her last few weeks of pregnancy she had shooting pains along with other weird sensations. It's important to relax. It's to be expected that when you come close to your due date, you are going to experience aches and pains. Some more uncomfortable than others. One thing my sister said was that now she is not pregnant anymore, she can relax from the stabbing pains in her cookie area. Good luck.|`|8tqgOoE9aa	It's common and natural. Every womans pregnancy and delivery differ. Your body is getting ready for the big show. Think of it as working out. Your uterus is under some pressure, and is trying to keep up with demand. Once the baby has dropped, and your bag of waters pops, it's your uterus pushing out. It isn't comfortable. I had pains like that, and in my lower back 2 wks before i delivered. Don't worry unless you hemorage, or the pains are preventing you from doing normal things, like walking, lieing down, or sleeping. Your dr will be able to determine if it's abnormal.|`|1tYw97CRaa	nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diahrea.<br>  jk<br>  constipation|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Could be, I am experiencing the same problems, plus some so I am going to watch this to see what everyone has to say.

cmg55EDEaa	How about stay home Dads?  I am.  Ebay is a very easy/good way if you have a lot of stuff to get rid of.  Otherwise there is a lot of home based business out there, but check them out thoroughly through the Better Business Bureau and an attorney.

M1KYxcvSaa	Early ultrasounds are very accurate for dating a pregnancy (it gets more difficult the further along you are).  Since you were not having regular cycles, I'm sure the Dr just wants to get an accurate assessment of how far along you are.  This will help him in determining your due date and make sure you are receiving the proper prenatal care with each stage of your pregnancy.|`|VS8mactUaa	Probably just to date your pregnancy. And routine checks and maybe to hear the heartbeat, with a Doppler you should be able to hear a babys heartbeat by now so yay, you may hear the little ones heart beat! Congrats and good luck.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think it's just to date your pregnancy, since you didn'tk now when your last period was.

If you are really worried, just call the office and tell them so.  I did the same thing (we pregos really are all the same when it comes to worry) and they assured me that there really was nothing to worry about.<br>  Good Luck!|`|e9bb69fe846238c30e6955cc8f654653aa	Probably not - if he told you it was standard, it is.

9hrJfhIIaa	Your chances of being pregnant when taking your pills correctly is prettly slim. If you continue to take the pills and were pregnant, it would not cause any harm to the fetus.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	If you believe you might be pregnant, STOP taking the pills and wait until you get your period. Use backup (condoms, sponge, cervical cap, etc). Once you get your period start your pills pack that sunday.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	If you had a positive pregnancy test, chances are, you are pregnant. Even though false positives do exist, they are extremely rare. <br>  How a pregnancy test works is it detects HCG. HCG is the hormone that your body produces when you are pregnant. <br>  If the tests were different brands, that might also make a difference. Some tests are more sensitive and others and detect smaller amounts of HCG. <br>  My advice would be to go and purchase a new test. I would recommend a first response early results test. Those tests are supposed to be the most sensitive home pregnancy test on the market. Then I would take it with first morning urine. This is when the HCG is the most concentrated in your urine. <br>  Good luck, and I believe you deserve a Congratulations!!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	if your period is late and you got a positive then your probably pregnant. your more likely to get a false negative than a false positive. try another or go to your doctor for a blood test to be sure. good luck :)|`|FLoKzTRyaa	Consider the fact that there are "fake positives." For this reason do not trust either pregnancy tests. <br>  You say you are a couple weeks late, maybe it's actually all in your mind. Biologically speaking, women go through so many different changes and some months you may skip all together. <br>  If you have had unprotected sex, go to the pharmacy and check out the different types of test they have, buy one that has two tests of the same kind of brand, hopefully it'll be more precise. <br>  If both are positive go to your doctor.<br>  If negative, for future reference use protection and if an accident  happens consider the morning after pill.|`|XeASdibHaa	Your pregnancy test came out positive which means that you are pregnant. The second one may have just malfunctioned. <br>  <br>  Especially stating the fact that your period is 2 weeks late makes it  even more certain, because if it were 2 days it may have been okay, but 14 days is not normal. <br>  <br>  So you're probably pregnant.|`|R3UVYaHtaa	i think when the first one came positive and the second negative then you should make the third one to finalize it. the pregnancy hormone was found in your test which is mean you are pregnant. but to be more accurate make the 3ed one and check it with with your doctor. good luck|`|r9Cuqpw7aa	False negatives are wayyy more common then false positives, so considering your period is late by two weeks I'd go with the positive. To be sure try and get into a doctor ASAP!<br>  <br>  =]|`|tFYDZvN2aa	Honestly, i think you should believe the pregnant one because if there was any positive test that shows that you have the Hcg hormone and you can only have that when you are pregnant. however, i do think you should take one or two more tests and then go see your doctor......good luck with everything.
VFUdAtrHaa	I envy you.. im terrified of needles in general. Your probalys still scared of veins and you are just sucking it up for your baby and your doing what you need to do as a mother. I get it done but they have to give me meds to calm me down before i go and get it. The 1st time i passed out clasped right onto the floor. So i really don't think im getting the epidural. SO good luck to you!!!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Who knows, you could be scared because of something that happened to you as a child, something you've seen on TV, or because of some irrational fear your head made up.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid of needles too (I passed out the first time I had to get an IV), but as long as you don't focus on it, it'll be fine.|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	I have the same problem. Once i had to get ONE tube of blood drawn, and the lady couldnt find my vein. So she stuck the needle in me 6 times and finally told me to come back another day. I got really dizzy and told her i HAD to lay down. From then on, they never missed my vein but ive ALWAYS been nervous. I guess it's something that doesnt go away. i remember when they took 7 tubes from me on my first doctors appointment with the obgyn! I was terrified!<br>  Anyhow GOOD LUCK & congrats!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Phobias are not always logical. It is a deep seeded fear and even though you know it won't be that bad you still have the phobia. Sometimes having something like a squishy ball or something else to divert your attention is helpful.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	Its just something you have to get use to.  I just to have to have my blood taken every other week and now it doesn't bother me but I am a chicken when it comes to getting my finger pricked and getting shots lol.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I have a huge fear too.  I can't tell you why you are scared.  Many people have phobia's and most are really unexplained.  It's just how the brain works. <br>  Just hang in there.  <br>  During my first pregnancy it was written in my chart "extreme phobia of blood work, do not take blood unless she has someone else to drive her home after" lol <br>  So I feel your pain!
q4ppgGe1aa	Sophia Juliet is my choice! Those are two of my favourite names ever!!

Although I like Rosalina aswell =]<br>  <br>  Rosalina Juliet is a little too much shakespeare for one name but the best name, only because I dislike the name Sophia with a passion.<br>  <br>  SUGGESTIONS<br>  Rosalina Saffron<br>  Rosalina Sonya<br>  Rosaline Sonia<br>  Rosaline Monica<br>  <br>  Good Luck =]|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	Rosalina Sophia doesn't flow very well together; it's alot of syllables. Of the two I'd go with Sophia Juliet. However, I like one of the previous poster's suggestion of Sophia Rose; very pretty! Usually when one name is long, it sounds better to use a shorter name for the other.|`|oxYnFxhvaa	None of these out-of-date granny names. It's 2009 not 1909! Check the baby namer websites for something a little modern.<br>  <br>  Sophia Juliet might have meant "young" before World War One. And Rosalina sounds like a fishing trawler, or a woman born in 1919.|`|PO2SeOfOaa	I like Sophia Rosaline or Sophia Rosalie|`|VdnAH78Xaa	sophia juliet|`|Uq54V5EWaa	I like the first name Sopia but im not crazy about  the middle name Juliet!|`|txv7TIgiaa	number1|`|jlSzYpZSaa	2 sounds better than #1.<br>  <br>  I would change Sophia to Sophie when parring it with Rosalina. Either Sophie Rosalina or Rosalina Sophie. My faves are Sophia Juilet and Rosalina Sophie.|`|aoHqKPZTaa	I like Sophia Juliet.  Rosalina in any form sounds old to me.  Good luck!|`|JYe6PIdBaa	i don't like either. no offense. but if i had to choose i would pick  Rosaline. <br>  <br>  hope i helped <3|`|RjpGomsyaa	Sophia Juliet|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Sophia Juliet is stunning.|`|HBgnkltfaa	Those are all gorgeous names.  However, Sophia is very popular at the moment -- since you have two less common names you love that are just as pretty, I'd recommend crossing Sophia off the list as a first name.  (Everyone is choosing Sophia, but the world could certainly use another Rosalina!)<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I like the double-A endings in Rosalina Sophia.  While it sounds very Italian, and some double-A ending names work just fine, the flow on this one feels a bit off.  You might consider the very similar Rosaline Sophia.  Rosaline is an unseen character in "Romeo and Juliet."<br>  <br>  I also like Rosalina Juliet, Juliet Rosalina, and Juliet Sophia.  Would you consider Juliet as a first name, or is it "middle name only" on your list?<br>  <br>  If you're looking for other names similar to Sophia that might appeal:<br>  <a href="http://muchadoaboutnaming.wordpress.com/2009/02/09/substitutes-for-sophia/" rel="nofollow">http://muchadoaboutnaming.wordpress.com/...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|coVZ1uqCaa	1. Rosalina Sophia is such a mouthful. Personally,<br>  I'd just keep it simple as "Sophia Rose."<br>  <br>  2. Sophia Juliet is okay. Just okay. <br>  But I think "Sophia Juliane" sounds beautiful.<br>  <br>  I would choose Sophia Juliet.<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  -----|`|R1cey1Evaa	Sophia Juliet is gorgeous!

s8VgyzE2aa	people make stupid assumptions all the time. I know especially when my kids were younger I used to get dirty looks and even comments from people who assumed I was a young mother on welfare because I have 4 kids and I have always looked young for my age. <br>  <br>  I think it's funny that you paid with a hundred dollar bill ha ha! I bet she felt stupid.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Most people who use WIC know this... I am able to get WIC to help out with 2 of my children since I'm not working right now, No one has EVER said anything to me along those lines! <br>  I do have to say that most people are suprized though when I have get my WIC items and then pay cash for the other items on "food stamp" day. I DO think that most people around here think that if you get WIC then you also get Food Stamps!|`|7wwLbWN1aa	I would have asked why she thought you were going to use a WIC.<br>  <br>  Erm, and being a former cashier, it's not that complicated to separate two items from the others... shame on that lazy person!|`|rjVALevtaa	That is really odd. I guess I would have been offended, although I am currently on WIC so this would most likely not happen to me. What did you say to her?|`|b6EyFLgUaa	lol first i dont feel WIC is anything like food stamps. At least on WIC there is only so many items you can get and they are healthy and guide lines. My daughter was on WIC when she was younger. <br>  <br>  Second- WOW that cashier is rude. What ever snooty people get what they deserve in the long run. Kinda reminds me of pretty women when she goes shopping.|`|aQVQUgIaaa	I would have been extremely offended. Granted, there's no shame if you need government assistance, but by picking and choosing customers based on looking at them to decide if they use WIC, is offensive. I would have talked to a manager and let them know.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i have had moments like that and i would have been pissed. i would have looked at her puzzled and said "what's that"?|`|1VdgsZPoaa	That's when you pull out your *I am dissing you but still being a respectable adult* voice and say something that indirectly calls her stupid.  I hate cashiers like that.|`|q7n8KKlzaa	Strange, to be sure!  You could have just calmly told her you wouldn't be using WIC, and you weren't sure why she would mention that.|`|j2mRop0laa	I would have said, "Why do you think I have WIC? Are you confusing me with someone else?" Then pulled out my coach purse and paid with a hundred. <br>  <br>  I don't think WIC is shameful but I think she was making a jab and that would have pi ssed me off. <br>  <br>  Eta:I get what you mean. It would have set me off. I am mostly deaf and I look like a 14 year old. When I have my girls out, I get awful looks. It's a good thing I probably don't hear most of what is being said. I have a short fuse with rude people.<br>  <br>  U sure you want me to come? I might smack her over the head with a prada bag this time.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Love how it switched questions on me....so my answer was for the wrong question...<br>  <br>  I would have been SO offended !! I can't believe she judged you like that. I don't even think they are supposed to say things like that. I'd be really mad and I honestly would have said something to her...
yp9rEMSraa	Some women stated that they never got any signs of being prego until 6 to 8 weeks into the pregnancy...could be prego but you are going to need to test...if it comes back negative wait and test again in a week....|`|6LxXR61Waa	Hmm .. I have just the opposite problem.  I never get sore "PMS" boobs, but since TTC (I'm 8 DPO now), I've had sore boobs.<br>  <br>  They say that "just feeling different" can be a sign too, so good luck!  Here are my other symptoms:  (I just asked a similar question a few mins ago):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aoa1xAHgPllkZGDuqEEzqO5_7hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307120516AAxDtZD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kTu7UtS1aa	The only true way to know would be to test.  You should have enough hCG in your system to get an accurate response.  If you test negative, and still haven't gotten your period, then see your doctor and have him/her draw blood.  That give you a definite answer.  Good luck to you!|`|AA10015577	Test and you shall find out!  Good luck and BABY DUST!<br>  If no positive, no AF, test again in a few days!|`|oHNrktxTaa	Sore boobs is a pregnancy symptom, it is also premenstrual. <br>  <br>  However, since you are a day late & never missed your period before, you very well might be pregnant. I suggest you take a HPT first thing in the morning. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
CdJtH0xdaa	There is no right age. You begin to masturbate when you masturbate. I started when I was about thirteen.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	There's no age where your supposed to start or anything, it varies from person to person. I guess whenever you get sexual feelings and it feels right to you?|`|6L9jJnchaa	It's better for a younger child to do that then to think they need to go out and have sex.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	boys tend to "discover" masturbation at a younger age than girls.  i've known boys as young as 10 who masturbate (thinking that no one knows).  most girls tend to begin masturbating in high school.  most girls don't become comfortable masturbating until college (that's when toys come into the picture).<br>  <br>  i started masturbating in high school.  i spent a lot of time in the bathroom.|`|rN0b4jWHaa	When i first got horny lol which was 11/12..i don't think boys ALWAYS discover it before girls do, and not all girls do it high school most i knew started when they were 13/14. SO it depends on the person i guess.|`|AtDlNnIBaa	well how old are you. there is no right age. whenever you feel the need to do that. or feel like experimenting.|`|LzrZyePEaa	When you want, there is not right age
IOU6zo9Raa	Classes are best if you take them 6-8 weeks before your due date. They usually last a few weeks. I bought my husband books. He never read them, hardly went to any of my appointments, wasn't interested in shopping for baby stuff or anything that involved our baby. Once she was born; however, he fell completely in love with her and refused to let me even change her diaper. he wanted her all to himself! My husband is barely interested in feeling the baby move this time, but i don't mind. he is going to be just as great with the next baby, whether or not he cared much during the pregnancy. When i stopped expecting to be treated different because i am pregnant, I got a long better with my husband. you don't need special treatment especially if it's a healthy pregnancy, and Your only 18 weeks along? It's going to get harder, but they just don't understand so stop expecting him to!|`|S4pNsW3Taa	You need to chill the **** out. My guy hasn't came to any of the appointments yet but that doesn't mean he doesn't love me and this baby. He's working so doesn't that mean something to you? He is trying to save money to be able to buy stuff for your child. Cut him a little slack.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	I have been going to child birth classes several times around my 4th month to get some important insight. But as of lamaze class & preparing of child birth classes I am starting them now at 32 wks since it will be soon.|`|6ZUnRxV5aa	At least he is working and trying to provide for himself and the growing family. Especially at 18 weeks along you should be worrying about it as much, not everyone's partner are able to be there with them 24/7 especially if they are working. at 32 weeks I make sure my fiance schedule and my doctors appts aren't colliding with each other much & if they do, I rather have him work that day than miss that day.|`|1w41ReD7aa	Girlll, I'm dealing with the same bullshit. Just hang in there,goodluck&congradulations.
hOOs3SQhaa	It's amazing what those little guys can do when their inside of you! It's great that he's moving a lot, but that doesn't indicate his size. Sometimes we think "surely he just did a somersault"--but he could have just turned his butt to another angle or something...I felt the same thing with my first, I thought "wow-this kid must be tiny because he is doing acrobats inside of me at full term pregnancy" but he turned out to be a healthy 6 lb. 15 oz baby just weeks later.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	My baby was still very active all they way until delivery. He was 7lbs4oz(I delivered at 37w5d). So not big at all really. My Sister's daughter was 9lbs2oz and she was still rolling around in her belly at 38 weeks she stopped moving so much around 39 weeks. She actually did a full flip at around 39 weeks she was breech then flipped to vertex.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	no. unfortunalty how much your baby moves in the last few weeks doesn't indicate his size. i thought i was going to have a big baby b/c i gained so much weight, and only felt her move as much as the doctor said was nessacery in the last few weeks. i always felt too full to eat. My daughter was 6 lbs.
sDdgyyXbaa	I think it sounds pretty hopeful. I had very similar symptoms before but you seem to have the full array. Remember that some home testing kits won't detect early pregnancy until you have a missed period. I too am playing the waiting game again. Good luck for both of us.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Honestly, it seems way too early to be having all of those symptoms...I think a lot of it is just in your head.  I couldn't get a positive until 15dpo and that was with an "early" digital test.  BFN at 13dpo.|`|fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	I have taken a hpt this morning being that am 10dpo...and i have gotten a negative.....I hope i miss my period so i can test.
a1uoxczTaa	i was getting the same thing all last week. i really thought this was my month. but AF showed up for her appointment. :-( i was feeling the exact same way as you do. and even after she showed up im still getting symptoms but i know there is no chance. i hope this doesnt get your hopes down because there is always a chance.
YFPMcHCbaa	Not sure why you're even asking since you are already taking tests. You can't assume that headaches/nausea/gas is always pregnancy.
oHNrktxTaa	If you are pregnant, it could be that your hcg levels are not high enough yet for the HPT's to read. I would wait another day or two & if you still dont get your period, I would retest again first thing in the morning. If still a negative, than I would call your OBGYN & make an appointment to have a blood test done.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!!!|`|yp9rEMSraa	I would wait up to a week after your missed period...i know the wait isnt great but by then you should get an accurate result....Best of luck and Baby dust to ya|`|1vnwW3n5aa	in the Morning when your hcg is high and that will tell you if the level is high enough but don't always trust the test they can be wrong
y5sWmbtnaa	21, I had 3 witrh my baby because my first baby had complications, I had 10 week , 16 week and 20 week sonograms. You would probably be better off to get it close to 21 when they can tell more about the baby.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	20-21 weeks|`|1w41ReD7aa	Awww your almost around my due date I think I'm 4 days ahead of you congradulations!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	my doc did one on 17 & 21 weeks|`|6L9jJnchaa	21 weeks.  They don't do more than necessary.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Usually around 20 weeks give or take a week depending on when you schedule.
oHO0XOQVaa	It seems like those who are giving many thumbs downs are of the type who would just think that you are young and ignorant. They are probably mothers who had/are having their kids in their middle to late 20s when they had/have a stable source of income and were/are starting to stabilize their lives. It worked for them so they think that is the right way to have children, the only right way. There is no single right way/environment to have/raise children. They have never been in your position and they don't know who you are so they can't judge and say right away what you're doing/done isn't going to/doesn't work.<br>  Some are saying you didn't learn from your "mistake." Well to me it appears that NOTHING WENT WRONG. If nothing went wrong what mistake is there to learn from? You described having your first kid as "stepping up to the plate" but I think that whenever you have a kid you have to "step up to the plate." It's difficult in general. You had your kid young and were obviously responsible and sure enough of yourself to have more. You even made a good choice in who you had sex with because look, they're still here for you.<br>  <br>  Someone needs to actually provide good reasoning as to why your choices are bad and mistakes other than "well most girls who have kids young..."|`|kOmS5hCJaa	such a stigma attached to teen mums? must people Judge that without taking anything else into consideration!  i would stop justifying your life to people! they do not matter! you know and that cool and good for you and your family! everyone else can go to **** you live your life and live it well however you decide to live it! that's your right! take care of you and your good family|`|145RUNQHaa	you would not get a thumbs down from me.Age is not everything when it comes to parenting.well done for taking good care of your kids.ignore the thumbs down.I do!!!!!|`|AA12362903	Maybe they're afraid your success as a wife and mother will serve as a positive role model to other teens who are debating having a child (on purpose) out of wedlock and before graduating from high school.  I applaud your dedication to your family and think you're doing a fine job.  I just hope that you were able to either graduate from high school or at least get your GED because you most likely will need this in the future.  Good luck with baby #3.  I'm envious of the stamina you'll have with you kids that I sometimes don't with being an older mom.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Its because most people who are responsible about making a commitment BEFORE they procreate are becoming a little tired of the irresponsible people dragging down society with their behavior. Although you went on to do the right thing and that is very commendable, unfortunately most irresponsible teens do not go on to do as you did. You probably are just getting the backlash for teen pregnancies in general because people really want to see better choices made by teenagers.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i sometimes get a thumbs down for working...formula feeding...my child is in daycare and because im a single parent...some people fail to look beyond and see the bigger picture unfortunately...which is good mom is a mom that will do what they feel best for there kids...you do right? take these with a pinch of salt and dont take it personally.|`|32866571f9996aa9d609f6f782586569aa	You sound like a brilliant mum-ignore all those ignorant people out there and concentrate on your lovely family.  Was a young mum myself and met with a lot of negativity and people always tried to write me off.|`|MJMsOFpiaa	Well, I've never thumbs downed you, but maybe they don't agree with your answers. Plus alot of people don't take you seriously if you tell that about yourself.|`|fznvQptlaa	i had my 1st at 17 she was six days old when i graduated. got married 4 months later and had another son (both with the same guy and my husband of 6 yrs)... all is well im a stay at home mom have been since my 1st was born. my husband is great. i say u get thumbs down bc most ppl ur age in ur situation dont do as well as ur family has. its statistically shown over time.. now im an at home mama to 2 crazy cute kids and have an amazing husband as well. no negativity here. im in the same boat (minus baby #3)|`|hl5WdXnbaa	ok do not take this personally<br>  <br>  The fact you are a teen Mom who is making it and doing well is not the norm at all. Most teen moms struggle.  I personally worry  when a women, of any age, starts a family without getting her education first.  I believe all women should be financially and emotionally independent to raise kids before they come along.  The divorce rate among young couples under the age of 25 is over 80%. So if your husband left, or fall sick or dies are you  are able to look after   your own kids. I believe all women, not matter what age should be able to stand on their own 2 feet first. This is much harder if you have the children first when a teen girl  have not finished high school  yet. Not impossible, but much more difficult.<br>  <br>  The first poster , she was kinda rude and that's why she got the thumbs down, not because she is a teen. Claiming that we are just a bunch of jealous whatevers shows immaturity. I could not care about her age but the attitude.|`|nxHztcslaa	I am 20 years old and have a 10 month old daughter and im currently 3 months pregnant with my 2nd... i am also married and my husband and i are totally devoted to our family... i get negative reactions too... like didnt we learn the first time.. people dont seem to understand that our babies isnt an accident and we actually planned our children... sometimes people just want to feel better about themselves by putting others down, or because they personally couldnt cope at our age they think we cant either... bet i get thumbs downed too...|`|eZAz6orMaa	people are ******* retarded. <br>  and miserable and jealous. all that matters is that you and your family are happy and healthy, who cares about a "thumbs down". **** that. i dont know why you would even care. <br>  Take care of yourself and your children ! :)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	people are that way with EVERYTHING. if they don't like or if they have the wrong impression about anything from teen mothers to bottle feeding to putting kids in day care and everything else if someone doesn't like it they give it a thumbs down. it's not just the teen parent thing most people here do not seem to care about facts all they care about is what they are doing and how right they are if someone is different from the way they think then they don't like it and usually bash it! don't feel bad. YOU know that you are a good parent and have a good family and that's all the matters. people on here do things like that because it's only the computer and no one will ever know who they really are but i am willing to bet that if it was REAL life they wouldn't have so much negativity!<br>  please take for example half the answers you have above that have something negative to say about what you just said. and even though you have a great life they still have to bash you! do you see what i mean? forget these jerks... they just think that they are better and god for bid some one made a different choice then they did.
6LxXR61Waa	There is no right or wrong time.  You can tell people whenever you feel comfortable sharing the wonderful news.<br>  <br>  The only thing you have to think about is .. if something goes wrong, like a miscarriage, you'll have to explain that and talk about it more, if you've already told people that you're pregnant.  That's why a lot of people wait until after they pass the 3 month mark (12-13 weeks), at which point the risk of miscarriage goes down significantly.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you are almost at 3 months and even if something did happen, you would want a support group there to lean on.  I would say, since you are so excited, then tell everybody.  Tell anyone that you want to tell.  If something does go wrong, then you'll end up telling a few people, but eventually word will get around and people won't bother you about it unless you bring it up and want to talk about it.<br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|LZ4QYrPXaa	people say after your 1st scan...and i swore that i would wiat when i fell preg with my lil boy...but as soon as i found out...so did everybody else! (i was only 3 weeks when i found out) i was worried at first about people knowing...but that soon went and i now have a healthy 15 month old son...and i am 20 weeks preg with a lil girl! and again i told the world as soon as i found out lmao!<br>  <br>  If it feels right to you and you want to shout it from the roof tops...go for it! <br>  <br>  Good luck xxx|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	I know alot of people wait to spread the news but I never could. With my 2 boys I blabbed immediately. Now I'm pg with #3 and my husband and I vowed to keep it to ourselves until the 4th month. Well that lasted about 1 hr and I was on the phone calling everyone. I guess it just depends on how well you can keep it secret.lol  I think it's just a personal decision. I see nothing wrong telling asap or waiting.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and Good luck!|`|758cDKEFaa	with ym first i was going to wait till after my dating scan although my partner had other plans and told everyone when i was 5-7 weeks!<br>  i told my two closest friends with this pregnancy soon as i found out then waited till after my dating to tell everyone else but only cos i was having some bleeding otherwise i would have told them earlier.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	You can tell them when ever you are ready. Some prefer to tell the news right before they reach the second trimester or before they are about to show. I told my family after 9wks. I told friends & coworkers after I couldn't hide it anymore which was around the 12-14wks.|`|zgnNoRocaa	Most people wait until after their first scan but its really up to you. I told b4 that on both pregnancy's. Good luck and congrats|`|XBYiHaWIaa	You can tell them any time you want, congrats =D|`|Frbf0A7haa	Yes|`|NCcpjBL5aa	Well i am around 4/5wks (waiting for doctor confirmation) and my husband and i have told a few friends and one family member that we are expecting baby number 4. I think we will wait to tell family as my sister in law is trying to conceive and it will only upset her. The way i figure it, we might as well wait until the first scan to know that everything is ok - i dont want to upset her if i dont need to!|`|CFFuFof1aa	You are almost out of your first trimester and for the most part are considered "safe". I told my family the day I found out with my daughter. I wanted to tell the whole world. Go ahead and tell them. This is very exciting and you need to have people share this joy with you.|`|ryvO8DMaaa	I think it's fine for you to tell them now.  I guess some people wait until they are out of the first trimester just because your risk of miscarriage drops significantly.  I on the other hand couldn't wait and told people as soon as I got a positive on a HPT.  <br>  <br>  Congrats!! : )|`|YIb23obFaa	dont tell them now, i was 11 weeks very excited told everyone and then had a miscarriage, you should get into your fourth month or the end and tell people, and just so they dont have to wait that long to see what the sex is lol|`|xTqNAcD0aa	we told my mum + dad as soon as we found out so if anything went wrong they would be able to help us through it, then we told other family + friends at 12weeks, however with my daughter i was gigantic by 10 weeks so everyone guessed, so i think you could tell them anytime from now on congratulations!|`|jXeUCI6Vaa	i waited to tell people once i got past the first trimester because those are critical months.  if you are going to miscarry, it would be in those three months.  tell them once you are 13 weeks!  congrats!! :)|`|sDdgyyXbaa	Congratulations. I hope that I will be in the same situation as yourself very soon. Good Luck.|`|rzf4tMXGaa	i told people right away when I found out at 6 weeks! I couldn't hold it! it's insane to hold it in til you're three months!|`|AZSIoSNoaa	I told everyone the day I found out (4.3 weeks along) Good Luck, and God Bless|`|AA12087024	i couldn't contain it and told everyone almost straight away!|`|txv7TIgiaa	i say go ahead and tell whoever you want enjoy yourself and be happy!:) thats what i did!|`|WvbfNV0taa	tell them as soon as possible or you might get your self into a hole heep of ****|`|43iywBGSaa	tell them now!|`|T48smu01aa	It depends how comfortable you are with telling people :)....I told family at about 11 12 weeks and I told friends at about 14 15 weeks :)...If you feel comfortable and excited tell the world!!!!!!|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I told some when I was 9 weeks and so many days then like 11 weeks.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	I told my close friend at 7 weeks and family but Ive had my scan today and uploaded a pic on my face book profile and left the page blank!!! By the time you get your scan they will add a week on any way with your date. Considering the first day of my last period was 12th December 08 I make myself 12 week and 1 day. The scan makes me 13 weeks.|`|AA11548630	wait five more days then start telling them<br>  people usually finish the first three months<br>  i told my immediate family and very close friends as soon as i found out , but waited longer like when the subject came up for others<br>  some only found out after 20 weeks just because we didn't discuss pregnancy until they asked why i gained weight and looked tired|`|9hrJfhIIaa	We told our immediate family right away (4-5 weeks) and then everyone else at 12 weeks. I'm 19 weeks tomorrow and I can't hide it anymore :-)|`|yUyx2nhmaa	tell them. i told everyone at 9 weeks
AZSIoSNoaa	Well she needs to leave him, asap. I went through this with my ex and he ended up killing our unborn child, I was in the same situation, didn't want to leave because I wasn't able to work. Just because he doesn't hit her in the stomach doesn't mean he ain't hurting that baby. I almosted killed myself after it was all said and done because of the guilt I felt for staying. Will her parents help her? Why doesn't she just kick him out if she is staying with HER Aunt? Or she could just go to a womens shelter. They will take care of her until she is able to do so on her own. She really needs to realize that he is not only hurting her, but also her unborn child and the child they already have. Her emotional state alone could trigger preterm labor. She will be in my prayers, and if you need anything else, my e-mail and my messenger are amanda.koval@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and God Bless|`|8RfmosODaa	She needs to leave him NOW! He shouldn't be hiting her at all. And hitting her back isn't good in pregnancy either! I think she needs to go to her parents or stay with a  friend. I know it is hard when you dont have a  job but she doesn't need to be hit. She can get some help from the state to get on her feet.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well you know the answer to that. of course she needs to leave him and just because he hasn't directly punched her in the stomach does NOT mean that he isn't harming the baby it does NOT mean that he wont. is this woman going to be able to defend staying with a man who beats her when he ends up turning on the kids? i mean seriously NO child should ever have to be subjected to this and NO woman should ever put up with it. who cares if she is not working? who cares if she didn't finish school? there are place she can go to get help. SHE NEEDS TO GET AWAY FROM HIM|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	she should defiantly leave him. why should she have to put up with all that abuse. its not good for her and it definitely is not good for her child or her unborn child. he could do them all alot of damage. she or someone else should report him and get him away from them.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	if her aunt were a good person shed take the baby and ride over to the police dept and get them to go to her home or she'd call them at least. that girl has got to look out for herself because of her kids if nothing else.|`|Vh9CbtLUaa	She should leave him, she should press charges and not let him near her other child either. <br>  Does she have family? (hers?) Will they take her in?<br>  she needs to get away from him fast.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Um...NO ****! She should have gotten the hell out the first time he did this as it WILL only get worse.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Yes, she needs to leave him right away.  I can honestly say that I went through that with my first husband.  She needs people in her life right now that will support her.  Please help her get out of the situation.  You don't want her to end up dead, do you? Or the baby?   I know that I'm being blunt, but you have to look at the reality.  Get her out!|`|AA11197832	Wow thats sad.  Any man to abuse a woman regardless of being pregnant is a complete piece of ****.  I feel sorry 4 her and hope she can realize that her and the baby are more important than him.  She has to do whats right 4 herself and her kid.<br>  See if there is a Battered Shelter in her area.  Most of the time (especially) when pregnant, there are resources there than can help her get her own thing going. Possibly her own apartment-- Her G.E.D--baby care--help with money and food--and even let her stay there free of charge.<br>  Trust me its not gonna get better.  MAKE her do something.|`|SWOUJWZsaa	she should call the police and if she doesn't want to by law u are supposed too the best thing you can do is call 911 and if she doesn't have a job you help her find one and maybe live with you your friend needs you|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	YES leave him right away only going to get worse. There is help out there for her look in the phone book and start calling. Plus its not good for the other little one to see this!!!|`|58G7ZAJpaa	Tell her to leave him.   I know it's easier said than done.  I was with my daughters father for 2.5 years and he was extremely abusive and worse when I got pregnant.  I was too scared to leave him for fear of something worse happening.  <br>  There are people and services out there that will help her.  She DOESNT need to be with him, and needs all the help she can get.  I was beaten when I was pregnant, and it's not a good lifestyle for her or the babies.  The next time you turn around, he could hit the baby or do something worse.  Please call someone, or convince her to leave.  I finally left my daughters father and am now in a healthy marriage, happier than ever.  If you're scared to talk to her, speak to someone and leave it anonymous.  There are people that will intervene.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and her. <br>  <br>  p.s There's nothing wrong with NOT having a full education.  it's okay, and you can still get through life.  Hell, I don't have my GED.  It's not a BIG deal.  Trust me.
KVSczlpXaa	Well I personally do not believe you are wrong at all in calling him a deadbeat because it takes two to get pregnant. As far as the last name give the baby your last name because he doesn't deserve the baby to have his last name. Of course you will have to explain to the baby why his/her last name is the same as yours but it will be worth it in the end. I have a baby that the dad doesn't want anything to do with also and we are doing just fine. My boyfriend that I'm with now is going to adopt her as his own and it makes it easier when her name isn't the other guy's last name. Everything will be o.k. Just keep your head up and be strong!!|`|f1393e3ce73fa7ca43a6ad0adb63c064aa	YES he is a deadbeat! He should man up to his responsiblities. if he didnt want kids he could have prevented that. if i were you i would take him to court over this. you can make him pay child support|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I would NOT give the baby his last name.  A child's last name should be an honer and it doesn't sound like his is.  Def give the baby your last name.  And yes of course he is a dead beat.  Call a lawyer or down to the health dept to find out how to get child support.  Court ordered child support usually comes right out of their paycheck to your hands.  Good luck!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well if you want child support hell have to be on the cert or it will have to be approved by courts if it isnt on th ecert....if he pays for your child and is on the cert he has equal rights as the father which means he will have to be proven unfit for the baby not to spend time alone with daddy potentially weekends. the crazy gf will be there too so bear that in mind all id say is think is the child support worth it? he sounds like a loser and your child wont benefit form him at all.|`|sq14ZJwTaa	yes he is a deadbeat... go after him for child support once the baby is born!|`|9P26sacKaa	Yes, he's a deadbeat and possibly dangerous considering he's having his new gf stalk you. <br>  <br>  I would get a restraining order for him and his girlfriend.  I would get a lawyer and consult with him/her about child support and such.  I wouldn't EVER meet with this man without my lawyer present or have the lawyer meet with him for you.  You need to tell your lawyer about his threats to you and his actions and see about getting restraining orders.  This guy can TRY to make your life miserable, but you have the law on your side, as well as having a clear head on your shoulders, obviously.<br>  <br>  You put YOUR last name on the birth certificate.  It's your child, after all, and there's no reason to have this guy's last name as your child's.  Many single moms do this.<br>  <br>  You're doing great though, not letting this guy get to you too much.  You do need to protect yourself and your child, however, and make sure your child is taken care of.<br>  <br>  Block the phone number of this guy's home and his girlfriend.  Get the restraining order as soon as possible and start talking to a lawyer right away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  You're gonna make a great mother, already strong enough to take care of yourself and not get too stressed over it.  I'm impressed|`|MhyuXBoEaa	yes he is a deadbeat.. but I wouldn't give your baby his last name on the birth certificate and as far as putting him on the BC I don't know what the rules are in your state but where I am if the father is not present to sign stating he is the father ( unmarried situations)  his name can not be on there unless later added by filling out the proper forms and being notarized. For child support you would be best starting with an attorney then  dna test since that will be his argument is that he doesn't think the baby is his. The sooner you file for child support the better. His name does not have to be on the BC for him to have to pay child support if it his child.  Unless you want to sever all ties with him and just raise your baby ( which sometimes is the best thing)|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes he is a dead beat. <br>  Go to the local courthouse, and file paperwork.  Force him to pay child support, go through the court system.  They will garnish his wages if needed. <br>  Do not feel obligated to give the child his last name, thats a personal choice.  Personally I would give the child my last name.
LO5aGYZHaa	I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!THAT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NAME!!!|`|ccLa3LxNaa	i loveeeee it!<br>  especially aubrey!|`|tnRO5gB8aa	Love It!!!!

Glad to see some one around here has sense not to name their kid after an object or ABCDE|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	yes i like the name very much
IuzaNq2Uaa	Just from the sound, I like Jose Antonio better, which sounds quite dashing.<br>  <br>  But I can understand a preference for Manuel as a family name with a great meaning and history behind it.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I like Jose Manuel better<br>  but I don't like any of the names, sorry.|`|Xvkq6s79aa	Jose Manuel

But i think its great your trying to keep the chain going. =]|`|IFlq1Iz7aa	Heey.<br>  Hmm.<br>  I DO like the name Antonio for a boy!<br>  It's very cute. <br>  Im not sure what a good nickname would be beside Tony. Which is also nice too.<br>  <br>  Jose Antonio, im 70% sold on.<br>  <br>  :)|`|Cfou70TOaa	Antonios ok but it reminds me a bit of like a forty year old italian, lol.<br>  Jose Antonio is a brilliant name, LOVE IT :)|`|z5olpY6gaa	Im not a fan of either of those names...|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I do like it. But it's also very common.|`|9298mlxoaa	no|`|N4U2oKwEaa	My son's middle name is Antonio.  The only reason is because he has the same name as his father.<br>  Honestly, not my favorite name.<br>  But I love my husband and I love that he and our little boy share the same name.  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  If you/your son are not Hispanic, people will look at you a little funny though.|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	I love Antonio  and jose as well<br>  <br>  but i am not sure whether i like Antonio Jose or Jose Antonio<br>  <br>  nicknames can be: anton, tonio, antoni, Ton!|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I don't like it at all, sorry.<br>  It makes me hate it more, because people are going to call him Tony... eww!|`|5Jy04RVKaa	no...i dont know why lol...just like more classic names like luke etc
8qw0Cdqiaa	I used the same monitor and what you're experiencing is similar to what happened to me when I became pregnant.  My readings were just fine up until the moment I conceived and then things went really wacky.  I had continuous high readings well past the day when I would have ovulated.  I eventually took a test and it came up positive.  I have to wonder if you will discover the same.  Good luck and baby dust!|`|oHNrktxTaa	This is my first month using the Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor. Mine went day 9 low to day 10 Peak, 11 Peak, 12 High. <br>  I tried both Peak days & unfortunately, I just got my AF this morning. <br>  <br>  I guess you just need to keep testing when your machine asks for one & wait it out & see.<br>  I HOPE you GET a BFP! <br>  Pls keep me posted:)<br>  <br>  TONS OF BABY DUST!
oHNrktxTaa	That is so funny that you mentioned this. I have been taking Prima Care One Prenatal since last year. I noticed this month, that after I take them, I tend to burp the "taste". Yes, it is a fishy taste, because they have high fish oil in them. I brought them to my pharmacist & mentioned this to them. She said it is completely normal. Who knew? LOL<br>  <br>  Best of Luck to YOU & sending you TONS of BABY DUST!!!!|`|9bpED4vLaa	WELL IF YOU BEING TAKING THE PRENATAL VITAMINS AND U BEEN TRYING TO GET PREGNANT WELL DO A TEST TO SEE IF U PREGNANT AND BUY THE WAY WERE DID YOU BUY THE PRENATAL VITAMINS  AND IF U BEEN FEELING SO BAD  THEN DO THE PREGNANCY TEST FAST|`|vcxdTXbraa	ohh yeah prenatals always give me nasty tasting burps
IuzaNq2Uaa	Yes I do! I think it's a strong, cute, spunky name for a girl.<br>  <br>  I wanted it on our own baby name list, but my husband threw it off.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	yes! one of the first names on here i actually liked!!!!|`|E6CShQfKaa	yeah!|`|Uo0b2aShaa	no|`|oxYnFxhvaa	Obsolete! Matilda sounds like a granny name that comes from an age when people rode horses, fought World War One and lived in a world without electricity. The calander had "18" as the first two digits of the year.<br>  <br>  In short, its too old and out-of-date. Something someone's grandmother would be called.|`|1kIP1q71aa	no, not really. it sounds like the book i read, it doesnt sound so good to me. But thts my opinion, if you like it, stick with it., Melanie is good:P just kidding . r u having a baby or something?|`|aDQgLEbuaa	I love that name, because it makes me think of the movie Matilda, and I love that movie :]|`|CxAoiqDUaa	NO!! that is another old fashioned name. Plus for some reason it reminds me of a witch? DKW??|`|bb609e55e51e67a75913792ea3e1618aaa	I love that name & I think you should use it|`|xTqNAcD0aa	i think its okay i love tilly though|`|4nuSg31Jaa	its ok|`|RjpGomsyaa	Old fashioned & horrible|`|32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	It is a bit old fashioned,but I like it..
kTu7UtS1aa	I hope that this doesn't happen to you...<br>  I had my miscarriage at 7+ weeks.  I had been having mild cramps for a couple of days or so.  Then I noticed blood when I wiped.  Nothing major, just a bit when I wiped.  I did not need a pad.  But it wasn't every time that I wiped.  Then a few days later, I noticed spotting on my undies, and blood every time I wiped.  It was bright red in color.  At this point I knew that something was not right.  I went to bed and I woke up early morning because I felt "wet".  It was blood, a lot of it.  I did not make it down the stairs when (sorry, this is really gross) it all came out and I actually had to put my hand between my legs to catch it.  There was so much blood.  When I first noticed blood, I was given a sonogram.  They saw the heart beat.  The miscarriage happened a few days after that, barely a week later.  <br>  <br>  I really hope that this does not happen to you.  Take care of yourself.  Good luck...|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I was approximately 4-6 weeks. I had taken a test and it had shown a slight positive but then I began bleeding in the next few days.|`|nlteggWIaa	i thought i was safe as i got to my 12 week scan only to be told baby had died. i didn't have a clue i had lost the baby i had no pain no bleeding nothing .its called a missed miscarriage i had to have a D&C op then to have baby removed.  the joy is im 26 weeks gone now and doing very well|`|AZSIoSNoaa	If you think you are having one, go to the doctor asap! don't wait! In some cases they can stop the m/c. I had One at 8 weeks, one at 23.4 weeks. Bleeding with both, more so with the one at 23 weeks, I actually delivered her. Good Luck, and God Bless
oHNrktxTaa	In the meantime, def. take a HPT first thing in the morning. <br>  Not everyone has early pregnancy symptoms right away. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!|`|yp9rEMSraa	You need to test...some women get no symptoms....
iQ13PoEiaa	i dont see why not.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Yeah you could go to anyone you want.
7ec1aa38a5171789cb76c4135993d94caa	Yes - totally normal.<br>  <br>  Through your pregancy your pelvis will soften to allow birth to occur and this will cause hip pain and discomfort.<br>  <br>  All goes back to normal afterwards though.<br>  <br>  Hope it all goes well - but do talk to your health visitor about these things as you never can rely on 'internet' advice from strangers.|`|RR35cmBdaa	im 8 weeks and have the same its kind of like a stitch i don't know why i get it|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	ask you doctor or type in google pain in the hips during pregnancy and you will get an answer|`|ppG2smDWaa	maybe

AA12041870	You are in the end stage.  It's starting, but not enough to mean anything.  Your baby is moving into position for birth, and he isn't just a tiny speck anymore, so your body has to make physical adjustments for this and it hurts.  Rest as much as you can.  Eat well, drink plenty of water, take a Tylenol if you need it, but relax.  It really is the beginning of the end.  Best of luck to you.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I would call your doctor and tell them what's going on especially if you've already been in labor once. Once you get further along you will be uncomfortable but just to be on the safe side I'd call the doc! Good luck!|`|c6bde8f9a87bbbe5e37ddc75d9270523aa	You should mention it to the doctor either way. It’s important that they know everything that’s going on with you while you’re pregnant especially since you were already in the hospital once for shots. <br>  <br>  I had lower back pains a lot through my pregnancy but I was on my feet a lot, too.
WPI0Z47saa	I never did it but I know someone who did to pay for college. It is very painful. Yes there are serious health risks which also include the potential to not be able to get pregnant later on for yourself. Some side effects are thrombosis leading to stroke, renal and liver dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress leading to death.It isn't a joke you need to be careful and think it through thoroughly.|`|AA11785285	Your first respondent is pretty accurate.  The offer is usually made to college women with very smart IQ's.<br>  <br>  You are given injections of hormones so that your ovaries produce many eggs.  Those are harvested via a medical cannula, under some anesthesia. <br>  <br>  Excessive hormones have some side effect. <br>  <br>  How long term they are isn't truly known.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Oh my gosh all I ever heard is that its super painful!!!!!!!<br>  But you get lots of money for them! <br>  I am pretty sure the put a needle in pull out eggs with a syringe... but that is not for sure that is just what i have heard...
AA11138222	There might be a bit of jealousy going on. The 4 year old is now old enough to do everything on his own and the 2 year old still needs you more. On top of that, the 4 year old knows another baby is on the way, which means he has to share his parents even more.<br>  <br>  First of all, be sure to punish him every time he hurts the brother. Let him know that his mean behavior will not be tolerated. Put him somewhere away from the action, and make him sit there for 4 minutes (1 for every year). <br>  <br>  Sending your 4 year old to your parents may sound like a good idea, but unless he hates seeing his grandparents (which I doubt) you will basically be rewarding him for being mean to his brother.<br>  <br>  If you think some of this behavior might stem from jealousy issues, try to plan some alone time with the 4 year old. Have your parents take the 2 year old for a day and take the 4 year old to do something he likes with JUST Mommy and Daddy, so he doesn't have to share the attention. It's important to do this with each of your children so they will feel special and get to do what they like to do, and have all your attention.|`|ja7J2cE2aa	Children can't be malicious?  What a fat load of horsesh1t.  Kids are some of the most malicious things that walk this earth.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that can really fix this is strict discipline.  If your husband won't do it, then frankly it's up to you.  The only way he's going to learn that he's doing the wrong thing is if you make him understand it.  <br>  <br>  Kids work in a distressingly similar way to animals: how would you train a dog not to do something?  Now apply the same thing to a kid.  It works quite well; even faster than if you were trying to train a dog, since the kid usually catches on the first time he's punished correctly.  <br>  <br>  Kids can be malicious as any devil, but they don't understand that they're being little tyrants until you clock them one and point it out.|`|dPmK83UYaa	Mine is the same way, he knows he can, that is why...Maybe seperate them when you are not with them, like put a baby gate and put one of them in a seperate room. Sometime's kids just do stuff out of "expirement" He may just be needed some more ONE on ONE time with you personally too. They get jealous and can't completely understand why the younger one may be "getting more attention" (as far as what they may see.|`|xk5XK6CPaa	wow,<br>  <br>  You have to disipiline him and let him know hurting his brother is not a good at all. and that if hedoes take soemthing away taht he adores and how ever old he is in timeout and give him a talk in away he would understand. look him in his eyes, hold his hands. squat down to his height and let him no.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	He needs time out for every time he is aggressive.<br>  <br>  Here is a book you might find helpful:<br>  <br>  SOS Parenting Help by Lyn Clark, Ph.D.|`|rDPADat1aa	First of all, if he's hurting his brother when left alone with him, DON'T LEAVE THEM ALONE EVER!!!!<br>  <br>  Secondly, you need to discipline him for his inappropriate actions every single time it happens.  He gets no warnings when it comes to things like this.  Try time out.  If he doesn't care about that, try threatening with naptime or taking away something that he really loves.  You need to do something.  Removing the 4 yo from the house isn't a good plan and only sends the signal that you can't handle him yourself.<br>  <br>  My advice is to discipline your son every time, be consistent, and don't leave them alone at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VNQ1EM9oaa	look i tell this to many people discipline works, dont beat your kids but punish them and hit them, it works, i mean if god said to hit your kids if they get out of line then it must be right, 2 is the best age to start because they eventually get the mentality no = consequences, remember dont be passive , or aggressive, be assertive, even with children.|`|hOwJu9fIaa	Different parents have different parenting styles.  When my sister and I were little, we got our tales wore out and then put in our rooms. As I say, some parents are against spankings, but if you aren't, he'd definately remember that tale getting lit up before he hurt his brother again.  Good luck.|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	My 4yo has had plenty of doses of "That which you do gets visited upon you".  For example, I caught her being mean to a kid at the sitter's (pulling hair) I told her to come to me, and promptly yanked on her hair (not hard enough to injure, but enough to get a reaction), she's never done it to another child, she got the same treatment for biting and slapping.  My view is that it is never okay for children to discipline each other especially siblings as it will create very serious problems as they get older.  Both parents need to be involved in discipline, otherwise the child will learn to play you off of each other.  A united front works best, so you and your husband need to get on the same page over this or you'll have lots of other issues to work through later.
YFPMcHCbaa	Take a test. Could be pregnancy, could be nothing. It's really too hard to tell.
PCK5bJt3aa	If you don't like Stride Rite..Pedipeds and Robeez are reputable brands. They sell them online, but some boutique shoe stores might also sell them. Your daughters' proper feet development is an investment, so don't skimp on shoes that are not certified by the American Podiatric Medical Association.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I don't know if they have them where you live but we buy our daughters shoes from pay less. She is comfy in them and they aren't very expensive either. Other wise the childrens place has nice shoes too.<br>  <br>  EDIT- i looked on line a little bit about the shoes that are right for your child and there really isnt any just they say to lace them tight. What about high top converse shoes? You can get them at sears and target or a converse store. They can offer the support she will need for her ankles and have the ability to be laced tight. I dont know if this will help.|`|th45yP4Xaa	They sell really good shoes at Target, surprisingly, and they last for a long time, and they don't cost much and they're cute.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Reputable? Why?

He first laughed when our dog was standing here him and flapping his tail in his face.|`|e6d488fd06516fb170be24d102096bd5aa	My 4 month old daughter just did it for the first time a week ago. It was so cute. I laughed really hard to the point that I had tears in my eyes. I was at a friend's baby shower and my best friend started making funny noises and my baby just started laughing real hard. I was sad cause my husband missed it. He is going crazy waiting for her to do it where he can see too!|`|TtphnzLuaa	It feels wonderful to hear them laugh for first time.Wait until she bust out laughing over funny faces that you make it will just melt your heart.
28QPS6V9aa	Well that's silly. Do they give you the option of paying for the lost book?|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is true everywhere.  you can solve this by paying for this missing book.
ryvO8DMaaa	First of all....your husband is being very immature.  I understand wanting something to turn out a certain way but he is being completely unrealistic to not even accept the fact that he may in fact have another daughter.  I would have slapped my husband upside the head if he had acted like this during my pregnancy!  <br>  <br>  As for him coming to the ultrasound.....that's up to you.  That is such a special moment and he should WANT to be there no matter what the result is.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully if he decides not to go, he doesn't regret it later on.  Ask him this:  Would he want his daughter to know that he thought and behaved like this?  If his answer is no, then I would say he should go.  If he doesn't care, then I would think twice before getting pregnant by this man again.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, he's going to find out either way! If I were you, I'd take him. I know for me, once I saw the actual baby up there on the screen I was in such awe and felt such a tremendous amount of love that the tech could have told me I was pregnant with an alien baby and I probably still would have been happy...lol. It no longer mattered to me what the sex was at that point. It might be that way for him too, who knows!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	have him go and if you are ahving agirl he will look like an ***|`|T48smu01aa	I say go to your 20 week u/s with out him find out the sex and if its a boy...set up a time for you guys to go do a 3/d 4/d and have it a suprise!......I mean this by tell him you don't know the sex yet but were hoping if would be more meaningful and more fun to see your baby in 3/d. If its a girl I guess just tell him when you get home.....but before you go home do a lil shopping and enjoy the moments :)<br>  I dunno just a thought!<br>  <br>  Ps. If you also end up having a girl and he gets upset tell him he has to be mad at him self hes the one that gave you a girl haha and hes the one that determines the sex, so in actuality its his fault haha if you have a girl.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	thats really sad. just be firm and tell your husband that he can get mad at you for saying it all he wants but he needs to be prepared for a girl in case it is one and that if he cant come around and accept that fact, then you are going to the u/s appt alone because you dont need the stress of worring with him and you want it to be a happy time. good luck to y'all!|`|ksoMldqYaa	Wow, I am really sorry that your husband is being like that!  I don't blame you, I would want to go alone as well and I think you should.  Sadly, he will have to find out if it is indeed a girl and you will have to deal with it then but I think it best not to do it at the office.  I know you didn't ask for opinions on the way he is acting but I think he's being a total jerk!  Who care if he misses out on finding out he's going to have a son, if that is how he acts.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Your hubby is acting like a spoiled child who wanted a specific toy for his birthday and didn't get it! For gods sake, it 50/50 what you get and he is old enough to understand that. I know men have this thing about having a boy, whether its to prove their manhood or what, i dont know!<br>  I would most certainly take him along to the ultrasound and let him see. It might be hte case that once he sees it on the screen he'll come round. Either way , he needs to rein in his emotions or he will upset your daughter as well as you. <br>  If it is a girl, maybe he needs to go speak to someone about his inability to accept what cannot be controlled or changed. Personally, I'd tell my hubby to get a life. You get what you're given with babies and thats all there is to it.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Your husband is being very immature. I think he should go. Surely he won't act like a baby in front of the doctor or sonographer?|`|58G7ZAJpaa	I'd take him.  It's a special time, and as mentioned, he'll find out either way.  IF he's seriously going to get pissed off because of the sex of the baby, I personally wouldn't be with the guy to begin with.  That's my personal opinion though.  <br>  <br>  My husband was dead set that our 2nd was a girl.  and so was everyone else for that matter.  He'd call us (my daughter, myself, and the baby) "his girls".  I would have killed for him to be able to be with me, but he's doing his duty over seas, so it wasn't an option.  We found out it's a boy, and we're both ecstatic.  Disappointing at first, but now we're SUPER excited.  We'll have a Daddy's princess and a "mommy's boy".   He was shocked, but we're both counting down the days until baby Austin makes his arrival.<br>  <br>  Take him.  Let him decide if he wants to go if he's going to keep the mentality the way it is.  A baby is a baby regardless, and a precious gift from God.<br>  <br>  Congrats and Good luck to you!<br>  ps- I'll root for a girl for you!|`|9S3Phnf2aa	Honestly, I understand because I want one of each too. However, remind him to be grateful for the health of the baby. He has to be mature about this and realize that you are sensitive at this time. Tell him specifically that you want a boy too, but he has to appreciate that it is in God's hands. Everything happens for a reason. I definitely  think he should be present at your appt.  Good Luck ???|`|AZSIoSNoaa	gee that is a tough one, my hubby didn't walk out when he saw we were having a girl, but he did kinda ruin the moment for me. Maybe you could just have them record the ultrasound if you do change the date, but you know how much problems that could cause between the 2 of you. Its your choice though, personally I would bring him, if he gets mad he gets mad. My hubby wouldn't go to any more dr. appts with me until I had another ultrasound (first ultrasound at 20 weeks, 2 one was at 34 weeks) and has only been to one of my dr. appts since (because his dad told him he was being selfish) needless to say he missed alot of stuff. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Wow. I feel bad for you on this one. I would say if he doesn't care either way about going  then you ought to go on your own. I agree with you that it should be a momentous occasion. Hopefully it all works out for you.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Wow that is so sad! I feel sorry for this child already. If y'all do have another girl i hope he will get over it an treat her right. My cousin's husband treats his girl like trash because she is a girl. Once he found out she was having a girl he wanted a abortion. So sad people should be happy with what ever you get. If my man was acting like that he would not go with me idc if it was a boy an he missed it. No body should act that way when it comes to your kids.|`|hSJnaysiaa	I would let him go. He's going to find out no matter what eventually so may as well get it done and over with.<br>  <br>  If you think he will respond to the baby negatively (if its a girl) though, I would re-think having your daughter there. Even if he doesn't cause a scene in front of the technician, you will likely hear it in the car, and your daughter doesn't need to see or hear that. I know for me, if I knew my dad wanted a boy so bad and I was a girl, I would feel unwanted. She doesn't need that.<br>  <br>  Your husband needs to grow up. His sperm determines the sex, its not your fault its a boy. He's got a few months to face the music but he needs to stop telling your daughter things that may or may not be true. Pregnancy is hard enough for little kids to understand, and its a huge transition for them to have a sibling all of a sudden, she doesn't need added confusion from daddy telling her she's going to have a brother and then actually having a sister. And she doesn't need her father acting like having a girl is a bad thing either.<br>  <br>  At my 20 week ultrasound I went alone. My husband was in Seattle that day and couldn't be there. I was relieved though because even though he has two girls that he loves so much, I knew he wanted a boy and I didn't want to break his heart if it was a girl, but we are having a boy. My husband was never that "set" on having a boy like it sounds yours is though either. He would have been disappointed, but happy the baby was healthy. sounds like yours might be really mad though.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	He is your husband and the father of this child regardless of how he feels about the sex of the baby. I don't think you should keep him from the ultrasound  as the sooner he finds out the better. Prepare yourself for whatever reaction you think he might have. He made this child with you knowing the chances of having another daughter are as high as the chances of having a son. Whatever the results he'll have to deal with it. <br>  <br>  It's not like your daughter will magically grow a penis between the ultra sound and her birth should she be a girl. Whatever the sex of the baby i'm sure he'll come around and it's not really fair to any of you to start this child's life of being deceitful. Good Luck to you there is really no excuse for his behavior but I wouldn't talk with him about it too much as it will just add stress that you don't need. Just go to you're appointments, get the ultra sound done and go with the flow. Hopefully he'll follow you're lead. Good Luck and God Bless.
cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	There's no right or wrong answer for weight gain during pregnancy. Some women hardly put anything on, and others pile on 20kg! It doesn't even necessarily depend on the woman, but rather on the specific pregnancy itself. I lost weight in my first trimested, but by the time I reached term, I'd put on 18kg. This was mainly because I had a lot of excess water, though, and wasn't really weight on myself.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You're actually right where you should be.  At 20 weeks the halfway point you should be at about 4.6 kg.  I'm at 20 weeks and I'm at 4.1 kg.  I was only 38 kg pre-pregnancy :-\|`|KD8ZsKamaa	One thing that is VITAL to this answer is everyone is different, im guessing you've had your 12 week scan and ante-natal appointments in between so if there was any problem with the little one or your weight they would have picked it up. <br>      I wouldnt worry too much although i do understand you, im 22 weeks now, when i went for my 12 week scan they weighed me, 4 weeks later i had an ante-natal appointment and i had lost 4kg, i was shocked, i was 16 weeks pregnant and losing weight, they were not worried however. I went for my 20 week scan and the baby's size in right on track and they sed her size is normal. even now i havent put that 4kg back on and have stayed at the same weight since i was 16 weeks pregnant, i asked about this and was told that sometimes being pregnant effects people in different ways, in mine it makes me lose weight, in yours it make you gain it. i wouldnt worry, 4kg doesnt sound a lot to me, after all you are almost half way.<br>  <br>  ask a few family members too, once i was told id lost weight i asked around and my mother in law sed when she carried her kids (my partner) she lost weight each time.<br>  <br>  good luck with the baby, do you know the sex? or are you going to find out?<br>  <br>  x x|`|98WKYtfwaa	Nooooo! I weight 9 stone before becoming pregnant, at my first appointment at 13weeks i'd already gained half a stone, i dread to think what i'm weighing now. I've not put on weight anywhere except my stomach, but i suppose that's good in a way.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Its a perfect amount.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i am 27 weeks and havent gain but 6 lbs|`|IOU6zo9Raa	i have gained like 7 lbs. 20 weeks.

HBgnkltfaa	Hayden Bethany Cecilia flows just fine.  Each name has a different beginning and ending sound and different syllable structure, so that makes for a rhythmically pleasing combination.  Additionally, the combo has good balance -- Hayden is more modern, while Cecilia is very old-fashioned.  Hayden is unisex, while Bethany and Cecilia are obviously feminine.  And I agree with you that Cecilia is gorgeous as a middle name (or even as a first).  The combo is a bit on the long side, but if you last name is short, it should be just fine.<br>  <br>  I'll admit I'm not crazy about the name Hayden (since it's so trendy right now, along with all the other Ayden/Jayden/Kayden variants), but I can see how it would appeal to you and I like the names you are pairing it with.  You might want to consider that having cousins named Ayden and Hayden could be confusing.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for other names to pair with Cecilia, I actually like the flow of Vivienne Cecilia quite a lot, though she would have a much more frilly name than her sisters.  If you like Cecilia so much, have you considered using it as a first name?  I like the flow of Cecilia Harper, Cecilia Belle, and Cecilia Rose.<br>  <br>  A few notes on your combos:<br>  <br>  -- Will it bother you if three of your girls have two-syllable H-names and the fourth has a three-syllable V-name?  Hayden, Hannah, and Harper are very matchy, and Vivienne feels like the odd one out.  Something like Hannah, Cecilia, Rose, and Vivienne would seem like a more balanced sibset.<br>  <br>  -- Since both Harper and Avery are technically unisex (though Harper is much prettier on a girl), would you consider pairing one or the other with more feminine name to make the gender a bit more obvious?  Perhaps something like Harper Amelia or Gwendolyn Avery?  (Of course, if you don't like Amelia and Gwendolyn, fill in similar names you do like.)<br>  <br>  For a more detailed discussion of how to pick good middle names:<br>  <a href="http://muchadoaboutnaming.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/middle-name-advice-rhythm-and-rules/" rel="nofollow">http://muchadoaboutnaming.wordpress.com/...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	I feel like Ayden and Hayden would get mixed up too easily. My cousin and I are Emily and Sarah and we still get mixed up, so maybe that's just the way it is with cousins. Cecilia is one of my favourite names; it's beautiful, not too common, and works well with other names in different categories. I would skip Hayden altogether and go with Bethany Cecilia.|`|YlLmAADraa	Hayden is WAYYY overused! anything like Hayden, Aiden, Brayden, Jayden, Kayden... anything with then ""ayden" ending is waayy overused. horrible choice for a name.|`|JsIwxjnBaa	hayden is such a cute name ... so  think hayden cecilia would be fine too. the thing is, bethany and cecilia in one can be a bit much. i have two middle names as well, and it kinda gets to be a pain on school records and such (it doesnt fit on bank cards, etc)<br>  <br>  xox,<br>  laura elizabeth anne|`|gzQIstDFaa	i dont like it when people give their kids 2 middle names.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Sounds like too many names!|`|abg9qu9Saa	i think three names is a little overkill, and you have a lot of h's. try to switch it up. what about Avery Harper? or Cecilia Belle? theres a lot of cute combinations you could try. personally my favorite name for a girl would be roxanne, or roxy for short, but thats just me.|`|6OplSEQkaa	Hayden sounds better as a boys name, it is my favorite for a boy.  Bethany Cecelia sounds great though! and Vivienne Cecelia sounds good.|`|yI8NhRllaa	nah none of them have any rink call your baby Isaac Unt if he's a bo y that name rocks<br>  <br>  ( say it in a chav voice (its funny))|`|4nuSg31Jaa	wowww

Eo07UMsRaa	Let me be straight with you. My husband and I have been ttc for some years now. About a year ago, each time we had sex, I would wrap myself up in 'I wonder if I'm going to get pregnant this time'. Sex became such a routine, we only had sex when the ovulation kit said so etc. I married my husband because I love him, we make love because we're in love (I had to remember that!). <br>  <br>  I totally understand what you're saying, and you just have to go back to square one, remember how much fun sex can be. Try putting 'babies' to the back of your mind - you'd be amazed how many people finally get pregnant when they have 'forgotten' about it for a while. Tones of baby dust anf fingers crossed.x|`|oHNrktxTaa	Of course these are all signs, however keep in mind that premenstrual & pregnancy symptoms are very similar to each other. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the two. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the one major sign is a missed period or a positive HPT. I would wait till the day of or a day after a missed period to test. First Response Gold can test your hormone levels up to 5 days prior. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK & LOTS of BABY DUST!

Fh4B88ZGaa	Don't have any children. Problem solved!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes, get custody of the child and then the other parent has to pay you child support.  Or have equal parenting time so that there is no exchange of support.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	the only way to do it is if you're dead... and that isn't me saying you need to kill yourself so don't even go there!!<br>  <br>  you made the mistake of not wearing a condom, now you have to deal with it.. sorry.<br>  <br>  unless you and the mother decide TOGETHER that you want to put the baby up for adoption, then there really is no way out of it. if you don't pay, then you go to jail..|`|s1utniuvaa	stop having sex and making babies. Are you some kind of jerk... if the baby is yours you have to pay!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Suicide comes to mind, you dead beat, a$$hole.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	nope ...bet you wished you used a condom now;)|`|AiwapbAyaa	i agree with Lisa! If you take care of the child as in being his/her guardian/take custody of him/her! My mom divorced my dad when i was 8 years old and he tried to get out of it and im 19 now and he is 46 or 47 i dont remember lol and he is in like $30,000 in debt because he stopped paying when i was like 10 and now he's still paying for it but he doesnt have to pay extra anymore (they stop adding it up)because me and my bro are grown now! So you better start paying and finish your 18 years unless you want a whole bunch of debt that arent even from credit or bills after ur child turns 18! or just get custody! GOOD LUCK! and do the rite thing! oh and btw they will take from ur bank account if you have one too!<br>  <br>  one last thing! my mom couldve allowed my dad to go to jail but they still had like a good friendship thing going on so if it wasnt for my mom my dad would've been locked up rite now probly....so work it out! man up and get a job k!?....they shouldnt judge you! nobodies perfect ok!?....so just hang in there!|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	Considering she'll prolly try to bilk you outta' the full amount possible it may be a good idea to move to Mexico. That's what I did until my kid turned 18. You can live pretty cheaply there. Trust me on this one.|`|65RZ441Zaa	If your from canada agree on  a 40-60 custody agreement, no child support, but make sure you actually raise the baby, and not neglect him just to get out of child support.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	I always love the "I used a condom" arguement.

NMKmmi5haa	I work full time in child protection, and the safest thing to do would be to call your local child welfare society...you could remain anonymous and could possibly be protecting the child...even the mother stating she is counting the number of slaps is completely inappropriate..maybe she is stressed and needs some more support or a community link...there could be numerous bruises from falling down the stairs, however it's also a common excuse for child abuse..really depends how well you know the mother and how many stairs there were to really determine...hard to tell sometimes...keep an eye out though there's nothing worse than a child being hurt that can't voice what's happening...|`|oHNrktxTaa	Yes, I think they can seriously be hurt, especially since they are little and their bones are fragile & still growing.|`|yp9rEMSraa	Yeah they still could have bruising.....it doesn't take much for a child to hurt themselves....I mean they are really frail....If they are bruised up or complaining for something ummm i would take them to a doctor...|`|Eo07UMsRaa	I think you should tell someone.

bMvAmMTaaa	if she is breastfeeding then it isn't a good idea. but if there wasn't any family history of nut allergies then it might be ok, but tell her to ask the doctor.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I have never heard of any reason not to have peanuts when you are breastfeeding except if nut allergies run in the family.|`|NysFTExhaa	There was a study that came out recently that said early exposure to peanuts in pregnancy and the first few years of a child's life may actually prevent allergies to peanuts.  If she eats the peanuts she should monitor her baby for signs of irritation and allergy.  She may also want to call the pediatrician to get their recommendations before she eats any.<br>  <br>  Personally, I ate peanuts through my whole pregnancy and while breastfeeding and my boys are fine.|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	You can eat whatever you want while you are breastfeeding.

C22jeMVhaa	I chose to wait with my girls. My youngest told me forever that she would never get her ears pierced. She wants them pierced when she is 7. (next year). That's when my oldest got hers pierced. There is nothing wrong with waiting.<br>  On the other hand it will not cause damage to get her ears pierced now.There are many cultures in the world that pierce ears within a couple of weeks of birth. Just make sure the earrings are very light Weight when they are young.There really is no right or wrong here. If you are uncomfortable don't do it. They have clip -ons and sticker earrings. The sticker don't work well. My 6 year old wears clip- ons all the time. I recommend waiting until you are comfortable and just get her a few pairs of the clips. Then both of you are happy.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	This is a big pet peeve of mine.  :)  I really don't think it's a good idea to pierce a small child's ears.  I've seen it happen, and it's so hard to listen to the kid screaming his head off while the parent just stands there.  Why does she need to get her ears pierced?  I've never had mine pierced.  I'm really not trying to be rude, it's just that I would never consider doing that to my child because I could never put her through it.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	It's fine. My daughter had hers pierced at 3. I think it is better when they are younger. There are earring for children where the post is screwed on so that a young child can't pull them out. I got them at K-mart. I think if she wants them then you should let her have them. It isn't like she wants a tattoo or belly ring. Do what you want and don't worry about what anyone else thinks.|`|EMEpr7Fcaa	Sure. My mom got mine done when I was a baby. Ya, some babies panic, other babies do just fine. Getting your ears pierced doesn't hurt THAT bad, it feels like putting in an earring and it feels a little bruised afterward. Usually girls like having their ears pierced. But if she doesn't like it in the future then she can just take them out!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the child has neither the ability to make an informed decision or care for the piercings.  in 10 yrs, the child can do both.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	its a good age to get her ears pierced. if you want to get them done and your husband is okay with it then go for it.|`|AA11296044	She is emulating mommy, which is nice however at 2 1/2 she should not be allowed to make such decisions as she has no idea that first off getting your ears pierced hurts.<br>  <br>  Secondly there is a risk of infection<br>  <br>  Thirdly although a piercing may not be forever, the scarring probably is.<br>  <br>  Wait until she is older, in her pre teens. For now stick to playing dress-up.|`|Q1SABrSXaa	my personal opinion is she's too young. I'd say wait till she's about 5yr old. but many do get their  daughters ears pierced younger than 5 and they have no problems at all.I just decided with mine to wait until they asked and we at an age where they understood it will hurt although it's not for long|`|hkQSqPEwaa	I think it is fine.  my daughter has her ears pierce since 3 months.<br>  star- my 7 years old have earring, ring, bracelet and necklace since she was  young.  obviously you are not a parents.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	omg she should be at least 8 years old - I HATE babies with earrings or any jewellery. i's dangerous and looks common as muck.|`|jcXSNjowaa	alot of baby girls get their ears pierced within their first year!... some pediatricians do it.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, I'd wait a few years. If you pierce her ears now, you'll be the one taking care of the piercings. I'd wait until she was at least 5 or 6. If she wants to wear earrings now, I would recommend either clip ons, magnetics, or the press on sticker ones. All of these don't require a piercing and will keep her happy with the earring thing for a while.<br>  <br>  Here's a few links:<br>  <a href="http://www.cliptomania.com/store/pc/viewCategories.asp?idCategory=46" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliptomania.com/store/pc/view...</a><br>  These are clip ons, which just clip to her ear and are pretty easy to use and won't fall off easily.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Polly-Pocket-Color-Activity-with-Press-On-Earrings/Alrica-Goldstein/e/9780696231926" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Polly-P...</a><br>  These are press on sticker earrings, these often get stuck in hair and fall off and get lost kinda easily.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.supplyjewelry.com/CARTmagneticearring.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.supplyjewelry.com/CARTmagneti...</a><br>  I'd most recommend magnetic, the way it works is the earring is made out of some kind of metal and a very small magnet holds it in place from the back of her ear.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	At age 2 1/2 she is not capable of making decisions - certainly not decisions that will affect the rest of her life. 2 1/2 year olds want to do a lot of things that parents know aren't good ideas. Wait until she's old enough to really understand what she likes and does not like, and then see if she still wants the piercings at that time.<br>  <br>  P.S. The above applies to anything a 2 1/2 year old wants - but re. piercing specifically, I'm of the opinion that little should girls avoid trying to look like women, until they are women. There are cues that sexualize girls like makeup, pierced ears, and provocative clothing, which some men and boys respond to in ways that are undesirable - causing your daughter to simply be treated inappropriately, or get harassed or worse. Of course these men and boys should not be behaving this way, but the fact is, such males do exist - so why exacerbate their behavior?|`|qAzXLqlxaa	I Believe you should have her ears pierced at a younger age because she is less likely to take them out and show them off to her friends when she first gets them pierced also the hole will have a longer time to stay open. my friend she just got her ears pierced about a year ago now and once she had the studs in for a week like they said they should stay in and the holes closed a couple days after she got them in and she couldn't get a ear ring through the hole at all i be live it was because she was so ankchis o change them so quickly<br>  <br>  so the younger the better also if she gets a infection just treat it with some peroxide or what ever medicated wipe that the piercers give you to treat them with.|`|SAqZbQqCaa	We let our oldest do that at three. She begged for it. She was very articulate and knew it would "ouch" really bad.<br>  At the pierce place she cringed, sniffled, then said "I wanna look at them".We handed her a mirror, she was satisfied, then jumped off the chair to go do something else. It was nuts. I thought she would scream or something. But she happy.<br>  You know the answer if you know your child. It's up to you.
sDdgyyXbaa	Try not to worry as bleeding can occur with a very simple explanation. Are you sure it's from your urinary tract? If it is, this is common in urine infections but suggests it's quite a nasty infection. I would go to your G.P. and explain that you may be pregnant. Your doctor will then prescribe an antibiotic that will not harm your baby. If the blood is slightly brown and not dripping but just present when wiping, if this lasts for a few days, this could be implantation bleeding that results when the embryo implant itself into your uterus. This usually occurs 6 - 9 days after unprotected sex. Meanwhile, drink plenty of water to flush your system. The more you drink, the better your relief from infection.

dgRTkccBaa	If you haven't been on the pill very long it could be breakthrough bleeding, they usually say to give it a few months to resolve while you adjust to the pill.  I had that on Yaz and ended up needing a higher dose pill.
PFJ7ZbVZaa	I would go to your doctor and have them do a blood test to be sure.  And get an exam to make sure (if you aren't pregnant) that everything else is okay.|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Go to the doc you may have to have a blood test done.|`|AA11369432	It  is possible.
MzHwklzKaa	When my step-father adopted me, we had to go to court and talk to a judge.  I was 10 at the time, and I was asked if that's what I wanted.  My step-father was taken into "chambers" and also spoken with.  I'm not sure what was said, but it was an "in person" sort of deal.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure that part could be handled by power of attorney at a distance.|`|HmkCFddAaa	You should talk to an attorney and let them tell you what you will have to do and if it can be done with just a power of attorney. That way you will know for sure what you  and your husband will have to do.|`|AWSmknxLaa	First the birth father would have to agree.<br>  <br>  After that you could go to court and submitted notorized forms from your husband.<br>  <br>  If  the birth dad says no,  it will not happen no matter how little he has seen his child or anything|`|AA12174100	it is an easy situation as long as the bio father is in agreement. But it takes a process off your husband passing a step parent adoption home study and your ec agreeing to terminate his parental rights. The end result is all appearing in a front of a judge a time or two.
WPI0Z47saa	My son was 29 pounds at 9 months and he wasn't chubby or anything. He is tall.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Every baby is different.  You can't really look at the averages.  My baby weighed 17 lbs at 9 months, but she was only 25 inches long, so she was actually chubby, even though she wasn't even registering on the growth charts.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	There's no "usually".  My son is almost 9 months old and is about 22 pounds.  He's healthy.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	My son just turned four months and is 19 lbs so I hear you. I think as long as they are reaching developmental milestones when they're supposed to its ok. Just ask your dr, he will tell you if there is a concern.
xvey8ixPaa	My dad started at 6 months! My grandmother says that he was a nightmare! My daughter started at 13 months. She started talking at about 9 months, though. I think that they all walk at their own time and they talk when they are ready.|`|VHHis05Naa	My daughter was 9 months.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Between 8 and 9 months old. She started taking steps at 8 months, but actually walking at 9 months.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	My Aunt used to tell me the averages were<br>  "walk at one, talk at two, potty train for three"<br>  I knew we were pretty close to these timelines, so I can't say for sure with my 3 kids...<br>  They will go when they are ready.  And then you'll wish they could just stay still, for the next few years!! LOL|`|t1fx6kXcaa	My son walked very early, at 8 months. But I wish he'd walked later. It was very scary as when he fell, instead of just falling on his bottom, he fall backwards, like a tree being logged. All my floors are tiles, so I couldn't leave his side in case he hit his head on the floors.|`|f0503b7c948aabdd21ad5f5ddaca7e86aa	My first son walked the last day of his 8th month.  My 2nd son walked when he was 10 months old.  My neighbors baby just started to crawl when he was 10 months old.  All babies are different, but if you have any concerns you should speak to the doctor about them.|`|rjVALevtaa	My oldest was 13 months old when he started walking. The average time line for learning to walk is anywhere from 9 to 18 months if you were wondering.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My daughter started walking at 11 months after I started pushing her to do it (my bad) and suddenly she was all over the place.  I used to bribe her all the time.  She loved strawberries dipped in chocolate and used to cry for them.  When I wanted her to walk I would sit across the room with chocolate strawberries.  One day she wanted them so bad and knew I wouldn't give in she just took off.  Shame on me.  Before I knew it she was all over.|`|ojUrCJi7aa	My little girl was a late walker compared to the others who have answered, she was about 14 months old, but she was talking really early so I think she was exercising that muscle instead! Ha Ha Ha!! She'd been walking for about a month and fell over in the park and broke her leg, and then had to have a her leg in palster for two months!! Nightmare! She'd just learnt how to get around and then she wasn't allowed to!! It varied between children when they decide they are ready... and boys are slightly lower, but if you are at all concerned go and see a professional... but I am sure everything is normal!! :) Good Luck x

When I was about that far along exactly (so a few weeks ago) I noticed one morning that my breasts didn't hurt like they did the day before.  Well of course I worried and called up the nurse.  She said that I was the second call that day to ask that question and that breast tenderness can fluctuate in early pregnancy.  It was very relieving to hear!  I know what you mean with the breast pain associating it with everything is going good!  I'm the same way.  Good luck hun!!  Best wishes with the rest of your pregnancy :)|`|f5yf9t3Haa	I remember my first weeks of pregnancy and I actually had no symptoms at all besides sore nipples that would come and go, (which made me feel like something was wrong or I was losing my baby) but all is well...then later I experienced fatigue. But now at 30wks its the same thing so don't worry about it every woman and her pregnancy is different.<br>  ;)|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Every woman is different some experience all of the symptoms and some experience just a few or none. <br>  We are about the same in our pregnancy. Some days my boobs kill me and other days not so much. This is normal so don't worry.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!

w5kQ98Fxaa	How long since the cancer? You should have councillors/CBTs helping you assimilate with your now different self.<br>  <br>  Oddly my best friend developed anorexia after her first bout of cancer also - she got to see a cognitive behavioral therapist and found out it was to do with the drastic change in her body image during chemo.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you sound like you already know the answer to this. You've put out all these negative things about the 'popular' crowd so obviously you know it's a negative place and you know you shouldn't be going there.<br>  <br>  As much of a bad-guy as you're trying to make out your mom to be, she probably means the best - you've had a serious illness and she likely just doesn't want you to miss out on any of the things associated with teenagerdom because of it. My mam was exactly the same until over time I proved I was too much of a little weirdo to want to be involved with the popular kids ill or not.<br>  <br>  Anyway, call a helpline or find a councillor - you should really have one as a survivor, and I'm surprised your ward didn't transfer you to an outpatient service where you had access to one. Yahoo answers cannot give you anything but sympathy votes - no councillors/psychologists regularly visit and dispense advice as far as I'm aware and I've been around a while. And I doubt you want sympathy votes. I've never met a survivor who liked them.<br>  <br>  Live on.|`|xGxczKhmaa	There's nothing to get worked up about here. Well, actually, yes there is - all the pressure that your mom is putting on for you to join the "popular kids" (they'll never do well in the real world, psh). That must be seriously hard to live with.<br>  <br>  You seem like you have really low self-esteem, though. I would recommend trying to boost your confidence through daily telling yourself that you're beautiful, that you will succeed in such-and-such, etc. And don't try to cheat yourself out of that by tagging a little "except that it's not true" or whatever at the end of it. Then what's the point?<br>  <br>  Just be yourself, 105 pounds doesn't seem fat, especially from someone who has your eloquence and seeming maturity (no offense intended, I just mean that I haven't met you yet, so I don't know anything about you except what you posted in your question).<br>  <br>  Don't hang out with people who don't care about anyone except their sick little lives. Go ahead and be yourself, okay? It's extremely difficult for some people, but it's really rewarding in the end. Just remember that this takes a LOT of confidence, it's really difficult to not go along with the crowd.<br>  <br>  This might sound a little weird, but how about you talk to a teacher? They usually understand, just try to find one that is truly understanding, not some person that would just blow off your problems as teen angst or whatever. (I know for a fact that I can honestly and completely trust two teachers in my school, and one is my sports coach!)<br>  <br>  Congrats on surviving cancer, and good luck!<br>  <br>  (I was also like to point out that England Auden's answer was fantastically well put.)

HBgnkltfaa	Zuleika is beautiful!  And, like Pretty Mama said, I admire you for choosing such an unusual name.<br>  <br>  Zuleika is interesting enough that I certainly wouldn't fault you for choosing a more common middle name (and if Marie has family significance, it could be a good choice).  Zuleika Marie would be a good blend of the daring and the familiar.  However, I completely understand if you don't want your daughter to be one of the myriad little girls with Marie as a middle name -- it seems so uncreative.<br>  <br>  Here are some other ideas, varying in length and degree of daring:<br>  <br>  Zuleika Claire (means "bright/famous")<br>  Zuleika Eve<br>  Zuleika Hope <br>  Zuleika Ruth<br>  Zuleika Pearl<br>  Zuleika Blythe (means "happy")<br>  Zuleika Corinne (kor-INN; means "maiden")<br>  Zuleika Adele (means "noble")<br>  Zuleika Mireille (mee-RAY; means "to admire")<br>  Zuleika Estelle (means "star")<br>  Zuleika Ruby<br>  Zuleika Iris (her initials could give the nickname of "Zia" as an option)<br>  Zuleika Violet<br>  Zuleika Scarlett<br>  Zuleika Isobel<br>  Zuleika Genevieve<br>  Zuleika Beatrice<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|jlSzYpZSaa	Zuleika Angel Amin would be cute.

9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	My son is 6 months and he does the head shaking thing too! He keeps shaking his head in the "no" position and he cracks himself up laughing. He doesn't have a bald spot but he does have a slight flat spot. That's from him sleeping on one side at night. He favours his right side and no matter what I did he moved it back. He's now 6 months old and sitting up more so it's started to round out but he still does the head shaking thing and it's the funniest thing ever. Don't worry about his hair it will grow in just fine. My son has a habit of scratching his head when I nurse him and he pulls on it too like he's about to rip it out. Don't worry though it will grow in.|`|VCCKfT3taa	They aren't doing it intentionally, it's from being on their backs so much. <br>  <br>  I heard another parent recommend that you put a swatch of silk fabric behind his head when he's laying down and the silk won't drag the delicate baby hairs out. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't follow that, the hair will start growing stronger when they start becoming more mobile and can spend more time on their tummys and knees and (gasp!) feet!|`|AA12254963	HA! MINE IS DOING THAT TOO!!!<br>  i call it dancing cause he is almost running looks like lol<br>  he had a head or hair when he came out most all of it fell out except for the further back of the top and the back and now that that's grown back, the back is going bald cause he's choop choop moving his head back and forth on the covers lol TOO FUNNY!<br>  CONGRATS MOMMIE!!!|`|AA11197832	LOL...It's perfectly normal.  His head probably itches and thats his way of scratching it.<br>  Im pretty sure 90% of babies have this problem (sorry it's not a problem) situation there we go.  So not to worry.  Who cares if he's goin a little bald, it makes him even cuter.  (who would of thought lol)|`|vKJcy19Maa	it is nothing to worry about my daughter, when she was 1 she gave herself a bald spot too so when they grow up they will stop|`|z6IekuwSaa	ALL babies do this! It grows back pretty quickly though. No worries!
778d4ea8e4fd14d8ffe5d9e08e94db51aa	My son is 3 and going through the same thing.  Only he doesn't pass stool every day.  But he too complains of it hurting and the stool is hard.  The dr has given me a laxative and it's made the stool so soft that my son now messes even with a little fart.  I opted to stop giving my son the laxative because he was going so frequent, he started getting a rash on his butt.  I have recently found my son likes fruit smoothies, so I spent the money on a nice blender and make him fresh fruit smoothies twice a day.  Hopefully fresh fruits will help your little guy too!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	no but give him more fruit and water|`|P1xlrvAaaa	No if he is passing stool everyday he is fine.What you can do is try to soften up his stool for him by either giving him more fiber rich foods or offering GERBER pear,or apple/prune juice everyday.this will help his stoolto become soft and make it easier for him to go.You can also try Little Tummy's all  natural senna.Good luck and I hope this helps!
6Ucy99zfaa	you dont need parental permisson. go to your local brook or other local family planning clinic; much less embarrasing than docs too. <br>  <br>  they can also offer other contraception, the implant, the injection, the patch etc. find out which is best for you.|`|CFFuFof1aa	I think it's different in each state, but I think in most states you don't have to have parental permission. Just call your local health department and ask them. I think the responsible thing to do is sit down and talk to your mom about it. She might get upset at first, but I think that she will respect the fact that you told her and are being responsible. On the other hand, regardless, you should wear condoms. They prevent STDs and birth control pills always don't work. They take atleast three months to get in your system and start working properly, and aren't 100% affective. I got pregnant while taking the pills.|`|hlWdFTcjaa	You don't need parental consent, your doctor also has to keep it confidential. I went on the pill when I was 14 and I didn't need any permission. If you feel that you need to tell your mum you are going to go on the pill tell her it is because you want to control your periods. Good luck and stay safe!|`|xSEXFWJ9aa	Go to plannedparenthood.org They well help you out with anything you need and you don;t have to have your parents permission at all|`|7cUDstdjaa	It is, I think that doctor's option now|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	You can go doctors for contraceptives for under 16. No need to tell your mum, but although condoms are uncomfortable, they protect you from diseases, and contraceptive pills don't. So either use both, use only the condom, or don't have sex at all; That's if you don't want a disease.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	In England you don't, one of my best friends is on the pill and she's 15 and her parent's don't know, in fact me and her other best briends and her cousin are the only ones who know.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	just ask the doctor if you can go on it for contraceptive and un regular periods.<br>  <br>  problem solved.<br>  <br>  they wont tell your parents because of patient confidentiality.<br>  <br>  xx|`|iR9w7d7Yaa	In the UK you can go to family planning and get the pill without your parents permission.<br>  I think most doctors will give it you too.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	yep
r7q8LW7Aaa	Actually the same thing happened to me! Although I wasn't actually in the hospital, she turned naturally the day before my c section was scheduled.<br>  If it's any consolation, my then natural labour was very short - only 23 minutes of 'established' labour! It's worth it for that!<br>  I do understand how you feel, I had such a hard pregnancy and was looking forward to meeting my little girl - but I was also desperately worried about the recovery after c section. I'd do those last couple of weeks again for a natural labour.<br>  Oh, and that Patti person obviously has some other issues - it's best to ignore!|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Yeah for you!! Now you don't have to go through the extra recovery that a c-section takes. <br>  Pass the time by sleeping, cause you aren't going to get any sleep very soon!! LOL Congrats!!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	I am glad you get a chance to have it natural! Pay attention to those pains as they very well can turn into contractions.  To tell you the truth, I got 1000 points on Y! A trying to pass the time!|`|RzYePezkaa	It happened to me with my oldest and she was breach with her feet in one side her head on the other.She flipped at 36 weeks and my water broke a week later.I was on bed rest the whole time with her.Your best bet if your close to due date is to walk to bring on dilation also a warm soak in the tub also helps with relaxing your cervix at least it with my 2nd baby.For now if her rooms not arranged yet take joy in rearranging her clothes in her drawers in a way that is convenient to you may I suggest onsies and pj's in top drawer because you will be changing those a lot once she is here.Good luck and congrats.|`|28QPS6V9aa	That sucks! I would be disappointed too! The pains your having sound like she'll be here soon! YAY! You can try cleaning and organizing her bedroom and everything to pass the time. You can also cook a bunch of meals like casseroles that you can put in the freezer for after you get out of the hospital. That way you won't have to cook or get take out when you're feeling all sore and blah.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	The wait will be worth it.  It's good you don't have to get a c-section out of necessity.  My second baby waited right up to the last minute to turn.  I was a nervous wreck with that squirmer!  I had a external version, only for her to flip back around breech!  She is now two and still always on the move.  <br>  <br>  The good news is, now that your baby has turned head down, you should dilate quicker with the extra pressure... I did.  Good luck!  You almost have your baby in your arms!!|`|B3uvhA7kaa	Aww, congrats. I'd probably prefer natural, not c-section... So be happy she decided to flip! Try to lay down and relax. Watch some television or talk to family. Be on the lookout though, you don't know when she'll come!|`|X9Tnpchfaa	sounds like your baby is ready to get here she just decided to get here the natural way. this should be better for you and her in the long run. God be with you both.|`|d1S0iQ6Naa	you are disappointed that you didn't have surgery so your baby could be born early? what is the matter with you? you need ideas to keep your mind off it? what are you, 13? 14? grow up.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	that's kind of a bummer because you were gonna be able to meet your baby , but look at it this way  she will come when she is ready and c section is more painful and considered major surgery|`|72Fjnwz9aa	Baby on cervix does hurt alot..but congrats on not needing the C...though it is painful to wait..lower back pain is normal, lower ab pain is normal..now if it starts to come and go and intensify (similar to having a period but worse) than you might actually be in labor..either way your wait won't be long though it is agonizing. Keep your mind occupied, put away baby clothes, cook, clean, read watch a movie, take a walk, take a nap (lol)  stay on the PC and play games and answer questions..any thing will be better than waiting. ;-)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	YAY!!<br>  <br>  I am so happy for you. That's terrific news! I know you really wanted to meet her today, but consider yourself lucky to have avoided the c-section. It's major surgery and you will recover much faster from a vaginal birth!<br>  <br>  If you're getting some pains, that's a good sign. Walk, sex, scrub floors, etc. Otherwise put your feet up and enjoy the last few days before the crazy routine of a new parent starts! :D I spent the time getting ready for things, reading, maybe some shopping and going out to eat with my mother - LOL that's what seems to do it for me, because I went into labor with my first (a scheduled c-section but went into labor three days before!) while eating out, and then with the second, went out to eat and then had her the next day. LOL You could always hang out on Y!A too! :D<br>  <br>  Congrats! Hope things go well for you!<br>  <br>  ETA: Good grief, Patti, who the heck pooped on your cornflakes this morning? Chill out!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Sounds like your well on the road to labor...if your concerned that you may be having contractions it wont hurt to call and get checked out. The worst that can happen is they send you home. But i am super jealous your at that point cause i still have 5 longggg weeks left before i am due with my baby girl but unlike you i am having a scheduled c-section because my last baby was a c-section. Congrats in advance and enjoy your new baby =)
j2mRop0laa	Ahhh, I do not particularly like it. I have accidentally said daM or Shiz, or h e double hockey sticks (the REAL words) and I immediately apologize. <br>  I do say freaking a lot. Or idiot seems to come out of my mouth when I'm driving.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I watch my language. I get on to my husband about it constantly and so do the girls. It's like he has NO censor.<br>  <br>  **For your edit. It has been my experience in little league that the parents and coaches are truly pretty bad in most cases, about language and behavior. When my daughters cheered this year- the police had to come 3 times in 5 months to break up fights. Several other times the cops were called and we left before knowing if they ever came. Terrible language, coaches smoking, jerking the boys around and hitting them against the head. It's a mess.|`|s6emVQleaa	It just makes me cringe.  I have a co-worker who has a daughter a little older than mine.  She was telling me a story about a bad word her daughter kept saying (that she learned from mom and dad), and although I think it was supposed to be funny story- I kept thinking how awful it was.  I would be horrified to hear bad language out of my daughter's mouth.|`|sxecXFgraa	As Belinda said, words are just words.  I don't use profanity because my mom taught me not to but not everyone was raised the same as me.  If my kids repeat one that they have heard, I just tell them those are words that we don't use because they're ugly words.  And people who can only express anger with profanity and who use the F word as an noun, adjective, and adverb have a limited vocabulary.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	you know if its not my kids, i don't really pay that much attention  honestly.  if its adults who are near my kids, i'm annoyed - depending on the word choice and frequency but in all honesty my daughter knows which words are bad and which she shouldn't say.  i don't have to say a word to my husband anymore, she does it.  <br>  is it the worst thing in the world to hear curse words - no not in my opinion. if i had a choice i'd rather have them hear curse words than derogatory hate words any day.<br>  <br>  edit - to your details - that guy should have known better.  he is a coach for children.  its one thing in front of your kids but good manners is not in front of others.  he should have at least tried to cover up.  to me it wouldn't even be his choice of words so much as his attitude.  yea the words, not good - but that type of reaction from someone kids are looking up to or supposed to be "leading" them?  not okay.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i don't really care what other people do as long as it does not effect me or my children. i try extremely hard to watch EVERYTHING i do when i am around my kids but when i see parents who don't i just kind of laugh to myself because i just think 'wow what they are in for' can you imagine parents cursing around their kids and then their first words are f**k you mommy' HA that's funny (maybe not for the parents but come on you  get what you give and if that's how parents are around their children then what do you expect)|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Sadly I am adult that just did that recently, but I can assure you it was unintentional. I had just had a huge argument with my daughter's sperm donor/father and he really made me mad. So I called him an ahole. When this argument took place, I happened to be standing outside my daughter's school with parents and small kids who were waiting to pick their older children up. I felt so bad I put liquid soap in my mouth when I got home. NO JOKE!<br>  <br>  But, to answer your question further, I get upset. I don't want my kids using potty words, so I shouldn't either.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	It's just not necessary. <br>  Although I have to confess I have sworn on occasion in front of my kids and my 5yr old is very quick to tell me I said a very naughty word.|`|AA10943329	I don't like it. Parents use it then the kids will use it and it is not a good look to hear a 3 year old swearing.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't think it is a big deal. <br>  I think that they are just words and that kids should know that they can't use them but others can.|`|prqrQcd1aa	A bit annoyed if my children are around, I don't want them picking up on words like that!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Makes me a bit annoyed to be quiet frank|`|um29wkUPaa	I get offended if I'm with my kids and someone is swearing like a sailor right where they can hear them.  Says to me they don't have any respect for me or my children.  You'd think the dropped jaws would speak volumes but nope.  Usually takes nothing more than, "Do you mind? My kids are standing here."  The fact that I even have to say it makes me roll my eyes though.<br>  <br>  shut up is a swear in our house :/|`|Lsy3tLUKaa	Mixed feelings.<br>  <br>  On one hand, if the kid is young, they're likely to say it at school, therefore getting in trouble and spreading it to the other kids. Though that usually only happens when a parent doesn't apologize.<br>  <br>  On the other, I feel that it's not as bad for older kids, because chances are, they're going to hear profanity at school, in public places, from friends, on the school bus... And wouldn't you rather your kids hear it from you rather than the school bully who calls them *enter profanity here*?|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I have mixed emotions.  On one, hand, bad words are just words.  They have as much power as you give them.  On the other hand, children repeat whatever they hear, and many find profanity offensive.  I want my kids to use polite words out of respect, not repeat the foul discourse that they overheard at the PX.  If someone is using profanity around my children, I ask them to watch their language.  I ask politely, and most people comply.<br>  <br>  Ooh, Cynical, you just reminded me!  My husband's first words were "Mom, you're an asshole!"  It's true.  He was a very, very late talker.  When he was three, he got mad enough at his mom to talk to her!|`|oIyXMnmcaa	yeah this is something that really gets my going---we took my younger brother to his soccer tournament one year and there was a fight that broke out on the minor's feild between two male parents. I could not believe my eyes...they threw lawn chairs at eachother and the cursing was just too much. This was all in front of a feild full of children and other family and children watching from the side-lines.<br>  <br>  This is bad cause I dont hold back...I make sure I say something like "watch your mouth there are children around here!" Even if its just at the grocery store (alot of people swear here for some reason) in the parking lot and I hear a bunch of teeny boppers swearing or even an adult...I will say something cause its offensive when I have a three year old and a five year old with me listenin to these foul tongued people. I watch my mouth at home...I am much better than I used to be---I am with smile. I say 'freakin' alot or 'frick' whatever works when the kiddos are around. I am definetly sure of my language when I am out in public...I make sure not to spit out anything inappropriate.|`|peQGGFPYaa	I prefer adults wouldn't use it. My husband slips quite a bit i think it's because of his job and the guys that he is with, not that im trying to make an excuse for him.  and we do have friends that cuss sometimes but they don't have kids so they don't realize till afterwards. we tell our three year old and have since she is little that those are mommy and daddy words only, and should only be used by mommy's and daddy's or adults. She never swears and is really polite, i guess its all about how much occurs and how you teach your child to handle it. But i think swearing and general is not meant for children's ears.|`|kM3t3iDsaa	Honestly, it really makes me sad.<br>  <br>  I've been raised to see people who cuss constantly as people who have no education. No Education in my Family is not a good thing.<br>  <br>  I do not swear, cuss or use profanities. In fact the most I cuss is on here. I have tackled a few people to take their language away from my Family and I. Then been met with more profanities.<br>  It's just isn't needed, and does show that the person has no education, as they cannot use correct wording in those situations.<br>  <br>  I have never sworn in front of my Late Father, or my Mum, nor my Grandparents. If I did, I would hate to see the consequences for my actions.<br>  <br>  In saying that, my Children have cussed. Dominik has come home from school with some very colourful language, but we've explained the meanings of all, and why they shouldn't be said. I've never heard them out of his mouth since.|`|QUIZ9Fqxaa	Angry. Adults should learn to handle themselves properly when there are children around. They should learn self-restraint, and it is just rude to curse around young ones.|`|KlWWh3fgaa	I feel angry, because whenever I'm out, I'm with my daughter. That means, that my daughter is hearing the bad language too, which annoys me even more.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Some people slip but people should be more cautious. It is your responsibility as a parent to mold your childs behaviour and future.|`|xvey8ixPaa	sad, for both of them.|`|TJusfEnlaa	It needs to be in context.|`|rBq189W1aa	That kind of sh*t really f*cking p*sses me off!|`|im3vWyv6aa	I grew up in a household of swear words. I didn't like that my dad swore around me constantly... so I vowed that I was NOT going to be a swearer. I stuck to that vow. All through high school, college, all my life I NEVER swore. I also married a man that doesn't swear. Mission complete. <br>  <br>  However, my dad and my three brothers continue to swear every other word in a sentence. It's the worse case of swearing I've ever been around. I want my children to have a relationship with their Uncles and Grandpa... so I grin and bear it. It's funny how people who know how you feel about it, don't try to refrain from it when they're around you and your children.<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|p0prrzf2aa	annoyed. such great parenting skills huh
xvey8ixPaa	It would depend on the reasoning. We had a similar situation here, and we did not let her switch, but the reasons she wanted to swithc were not good reasons. She thought that they were, at the time, but now as a grown up she sees we were right. It would really depend, though. I listen to my kids, I talk to them about all options, even ones I do not agree with. So, in my house I like to believe we would come to the conclusion that was best for everyone.|`|p0prrzf2aa	depends on why she wanted to switch|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Just switching from one public school to another? No cost to me?  Sure.<br>  Unless I knew her reasons were invalid-- like it was to be with a boyfriend or friends who are a bad influence on her and I thought it would disrupt her studies.<br>  <br>  But if you just like the reputation of the other school better or you are having problems at your current school, I think it is totally acceptable for you to transfer.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I would let her switch under the following conditions:<br>  <br>  1. The new school is as good academically as the old one.<br>  2. The new school provides a safe and respectful environment that is conducive to learning.<br>  3. The new school provides opportunities for involvement in extracurricular activities and interests.<br>  4. There would be no additional inconvenience to me, such as having to drive there every day.<br>  <br>  Any school that meets those standards would be OK with me.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	It would depend on the reason.<br>  <br>  I hated high school.  I mean, absoluely hated it.  I was the target of a lot of bullying  (it would have been called harassment now) and they pretty much made my life miserable.  (this was before all of the anti-bullying education was done.  Bullying was just part of growing up and we were told to just "not let it bother us")<br>  <br>  I *begged* my parents to let me change schools, but I was fed the line about "just ignoring it".  I had friends in other schools and I just wanted to break away from the bullies and have a fresh start someplace else.<br>  <br>  If any of my children came to me with a situation like that, I would move them in a heartbeat.  Immediately.  It's not up to the kids to endure that crap while the adults scratch their heads and try to figure something else out.  <br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, I'd want to hear your reasons and your rationale for wanting to switch schools.|`|YkD4Pf2Raa	only if i disagreed with the way the school is run, or of she is getting bullied or has lots of friends at the other school and hardly any at hers.<br>  <br>  you only talked about the travel times/distances. if this is a reason for changing, you should be grateful to live close to your school. i live 30 mins away from mine, and on bad traffic days it can take up to 45 minutes to get there.|`|J1kJb98Maa	no<br>  you cant get everything you want in life<br>  deal with what you have or you will just learn to give up and run away|`|XpWjdPg2aa	I would let her, if she was unhappy at her school. I was, and then my mom let me switch to private school. It's about a 15 minute drive. She drives me every morning =)<br>  <br>  Make sure you tell your parents your reasons for wanting to switch. And be mature about it. Come up with a good, non-yelling argument.|`|0NhR5hmraa	yes. but make sure you do really want to leave, i made the mistake thinking the school i go to now would be better then public school. its ten times worse, as soon as this years over im going back....plus i have over an hour bus ride.|`|EjV3rIvJaa	depends..<br>  <br>  crap results: MOVE<br>  bullying:MOVE<br>  anythng alse : MOVE<br>  <br>  but keep in touch with your friends|`|u8ScwUaTaa	if i wanted to switch schools my mom would have ask me for a good reason why because i good to a really good school..but if u do then i guess u should be aloud too|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Depends what the reason is...if it's for the sake of going...then no. If it's because your normal school sucks, then maybe ill think about it. :P|`|FiUprYsvaa	Sure. <br>  <br>  As long as the school was just as good or better.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	yes, simple as that|`|B4MHj9u0aa	yes!<br>  but that's just the oppinion of a 14 year old girl who also wants to switch schools.<br>  but i'm not able to walk to any of the schools around here!

98WKYtfwaa	I'm the same, i religiously took folic acid until i was about 15weeks, now i keep forgetting to take my other vitamin. <br>  <br>  I do remember myself as much as possible but sometimes i go here and there without it. <br>  <br>  You just get extra vitamins and minerals from it that your body might be lacking, your baby takes all the nutrients from the food you eat and if you don't have enough say calcium the baby will take it from your body e.g. teeth and bones, so really the prenatal is to stock up your supply of vitamins.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	It's really important to eat vitamins during pregnancy to keep yourself, and your unborn baby healthy.

wWkfASTNaa	It generally takes a man about 36 hours for his sperm to recover once he ejaculates, thats why alot of people do the every other day route, it seems to work for a lot of peopl, worked for us. But if the man has no fertility issues, having sex every day doesnt necessarily decrease your chances, it decreases his sperm count a little bit so there is less than if you give it time to regenerate, but there would still be enough to get you pregnant. I dont know the exact amount but there is a rediculous amount of sperm in one ejaculation so even if it is slightly lower, there should be no problem.|`|NMKmmi5haa	I have read that it's optimal that you have sex every 24-48hrs, keeping in mind however that if you have sex every OTHER day this will raise your chances of conceiving as his sperm will be built up more and more chances of reaching the egg...so doing it every day is just fine just every other day would raise your chances. Good luck!|`|Qya8Qu9Jaa	It does make sense because the male has less sperm if you do it every day so at that point its basically impossible to get someone pregnant. If you're trying to get pregnant I suggest you wait one to two days before having sex so that his seed can build back up. The odds are much higher that way.|`|we9sS2tNaa	My doctor said 3-4 times a week is what she recommends. Men can ejaculate everyday and it really won't effect them because when they release it's like thousands of little swimmers so I think every other day is fine. I'm trying to do the same myself...it would be easier if my hubby didn't have to work LOL<br>  It will happen. Good Luck!|`|NShMySwBaa	It takes sperm 36 to 48 hours for reproduce for best mobility. So it is slightly dropping your chances but not really all that much. Sperm is more mobile in the morning so if you are going to baby dance everyday that would create your best chances. Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|N2AKuvVkaa	With trying to conceive, you need to stop trying. I know that sounds silly, but the less you think about it, the more likely the chances of you falling pregnant. And oh my gawd aren't you tired?<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Kym J|`|2f6diQBiaa	Every day will not decrease your chances. Every other day is only recommended for men with low sperm count. Otherwise, if the sperm count is fine, then every day is actually recommended. Good luck!!!|`|YyrLtbH3aa	ummm wait til you ovulate.Whoa,he definitely needs to bring up his sperm count.Having sex often can actually lead to a low sperm count so thats what i would recommend.Good luck!|`|6R9McFZhaa	just make sex and don't worry about getting pregnant ,there are some position that give you more chance to get pregnant ,get on internet ,it is better to find more information in internet than here because yahoo is going to block everybody and yes having sex everyday is good to get pregnant|`|oHNrktxTaa	By having intercourse every day will help your chances on getting pregnant.

uMIvRRjoaa	You can certainly hit the ER if you're unable to cope right now, but here's some more info for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/mastitis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  GENERAL SUPPORTIVE MEASURES <br>  Plugged Duct<br>  <br>  Rest <br>  Adequate fluids <br>  Nutritious foods will help to strengthen mom's immune system <br>   Mastitis<br>  <br>  Bed rest (preferably with baby) <br>  Increase fluids, adequate nutrition <br>  Get help around the house <br>   <br>  BREASTFEEDING MANAGEMENT<br>   -- SAME for plugged duct or mastitis <br>   -- important to start treatment promptly <br>  "Heat, Massage, Rest, Empty Breast" <br>   <br>  General Nurse frequently & empty the breasts thoroughly. <br>  Aim for nursing at least every 2 hrs. Keep the affected breast as empty as possible, but don’t neglect the other breast. <br>  When unable to breastfeed, mom should express milk frequently and thoroughly (with a breast pump or by hand). <br>   <br>      <br>  Before nursing Use heat & gentle massage before nursing <br>  - Warm compress. Try using a disposable diaper: fill the diaper with hot water (try the temperature on your wrist first to avoid burns), squeeze the diaper out a bit, then put the inside of the diaper toward the breast. This will stay warm much longer than a wet cloth.<br>  - Basin soak. Fill sink or bowl with hot water and submerge breast in water while massaging the plugged area toward the nipple. Some report better results when epsom salts are added to the water -- add a handful of epsom salts per 2 quarts (2 liters) of water. Rinse with fresh water before nursing, as baby may object to the taste.<br>  - Hot Shower. It can be helpful to massage in the shower with a large-toothed comb. The comb should be drawn through a bar of soap until it is very soapy and then used to gently massage over the affected area in the direction of the nipple. <br>  Loosen bra & any constrictive clothing to aid milk flow. <br>   <br>      <br>  While nursing Nurse on the affected breast first; if it hurts too much to do this, switch to the affected breast directly after let-down. <br>  Ensure good positioning & latch. Use whatever positioning is most comfortable and/or allows the plugged area to be massaged. <br>  Note: Advice to point baby's chin (or nose) toward the plugged area is not necessarily going to be helpful as it is based on the idea that the milk ducts take a nice, direct route to the nipple - recent research tells us that this is not true, and that a particular duct might begin in one area of the breast but can "wander" in many different directions before terminating in any area of the nipple. <br>  Use breast compressions. <br>  Massage gently but firmly from the plugged area toward the nipple. <br>  Try nursing while leaning over baby (sometimes called "dangle feeding") so that gravity aids in dislodging the plug. <br>   <br>      <br>  After nursing Pump or hand express after nursing to aid milk drainage and speed healing. <br>  Use cold compresses between feedings for pain & inflammation. <br>   <br>      <br>    See also How do you treat a milk blister? <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  MEDICATION * <br>  Plugged duct Mastitis <br>  Analgesia<br>  Pain reliever/anti-inflammatory <br>  (e.g., ibuprofen) <br>  Second choice – pain reliever alone <br>  (e.g.,acetaminophen) <br>   Analgesia<br>  Same as for plugged duct <br>   <br>  Antibiotic?<br>  No <br>   Antibiotic?<br>  No: If symptoms are mild and have been present for less than 24 hours. <br>  Yes: If symptoms are not improving in 12-24 hours, or if mom is acutely ill.<br>    <br>  Most common pathogen is penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. <br>  Typical antibiotics used for mastitis:<br>  - Dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, amoxycillin-clavulinic acid<br>  - Cephalexin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, nafcillin <br>  Most recommend 10-14 day treatment to prevent relapse.

Non-infectious mastitis can usually be resolved without the use of antibiotics. However, per the World Health Organization document Mastitis: Causes and Management, "Without effective removal of milk, non-infectious mastitis was likely to progress to infectious mastitis, and infectious mastitis to the formation of an abscess."<br>  <br>  Per the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine's Clinical Protocol for Mastitis:<br>  <br>  "If symptoms of mastitis are mild and have been present for less than 24 hours, conservative management (effective milk removal and supportive measures) may be sufficient. If symptoms are not improving in 12-24 hours, or if the woman is acutely ill, antibiotics should be started."<br>  <br>  If a mom with mastitis has no obvious risk factors for infection (as|`|W8UZebRWaa	No reason to prolong the agony!|`|6db9f742a1916600f115b248eaa65ec2aa	Er immedialy|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	Go ahead and go to the ER so they can get you started on antibiotics and get some relief|`|CpWGvDvRaa	I would go now.

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	They're often very subtle, not the same for everyone, and of course similar to PMS.<br>  <br>  Here were my very early pregnancy symptoms (before missed period):  fatigue, constipation, breast tenderness a burning in the uterus area which I realized was implantation (very shortly before period was due), and a general "loosening of my thoughts" which I only recognized the second time I was pregnant.  The other common early pregnancy symptom is morning sickness.<br>  <br>  The earliest ones are usually fatigue, constipation, breast tenderness and nausea, and they can happen within days of conception, even before implantation, in some people.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Try going to the websites gurgle.co.uk or babycentre.co.uk :)|`|52E9NR2Waa	I've done a lot of research on symptoms of pregnancy, and the most frusturating thing that I found was that many symptoms are identical to PMS.

wWkfASTNaa	It could be related or unrelated. You may be ovulating later than you though, I always had a few cramps when I o'd. Or you ovulated sooner than thought and it is implantation. Usually implantation occurs anywhere from 5-12 days past ovulation but for some it occurs sooner or later. There is no magic number of days past ovulation that implantation could or should occur. It may be a little early for any real symptoms. I am almost 5 weeks now and am just now starting to feel tired but I had cramps from 3 days past O on...

HBgnkltfaa	Actually, what most often happens is that parents give their girls what traditionally were boy names.  After a while, these formerly masculine names begin to be perceived as feminine.  Ashley, Aubrey, Cary, Linsday, Sidney, Leslie, Kelly, Evelyn, Meredith, Morgan, Madison, Joyce, Lauren, Sasha, Alexis, Brooke, Lynn, and many others were all surprisingly originally male names.  Of course, now hardly anyone uses them on boys because they seem too "girly."<br>  <br>  Modern parents who name their girls Tyler, Charlie, James, Kyle, or Blake are just continuing the trend.  The difference is that, in our time, these names are still traditionally masculine.  There are more male Kyles than female Kyles so the name still seems like a boys' name.<br>  <br>  It does really bother me when parents of girls steal boys' names for their daughters because it renders most of them unusable on boys.  For example, I love the way Ashley and Loren would sound on boys, but I realize they would be difficult for a little boy to wear now-a-days since they have been taken over by girls.  I'm not ready to let choices like Blake, Tyler, and James be taken over as well.  There are so many fabulous girls' names and the usable boys' name pool seems to be shrinking.<br>  <br>  It doesn't bother me personally when parents name their boys things like Shannon or Cary, since those are traditionally male names, but I think it might be a little hard for the boys to live with, so I don't think they are the best options.  I admire the parents for trying to "reclaim" the names, but at the same time I'm ready to sympathize with their sons if they don't like their names.<br>  <br>  In general, I think it's best to choose feminine names for girls and masculine names for boys.  That's not to say every girl has to have a frilly name like Cecilia, Isabella, Julianna -- there are plenty of feminine names with a strong, straightforward, frill-free vibe, like Carys, Maren, Carmen, Helen, Alison, or Hazel.  Feeling like we have to give masculine names to our daughters in order to make them strong is actually very sexist.  Who says a woman named Cecilia can't be as strong and successful as a woman named Blake?  We shouldn't feel that we need to make our girls into boys in order for them to be successful.|`|AA11138222	Well...Shannon is a boy's name, Lindsay technically is too and Sasha is a boy's nickname. But anyhow, I HATE names like Tyler and Charlie for a girl!|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Well Lindsey and Ashley, for one, as well as others, were ORIGINALLY boys name, and only became common girls names relatively recently.<br>  <br>  Most of the names you listed are actually quite ambiguous.<br>  <br>  I would have a bit of a problem with parents naming their daughter Matthew or Collin, but I have known and known of FAR more girls named Riley than boys, and I associate more closely with a girls name.<br>  <br>  The first Sasha I ever knew was a little Russian boy in my Kindergarten class.<br>  <br>  Charlie and Toni are actually nicknames for very girly names (Charlotte and Antoinette/ia), and were probably chosen or approved by the child over other options.<br>  <br>  <br>  My name pet peeve is people who make up words or invent bizarre spellings for their child's name.  Leave the bizarre spellings for them to come up with in high school and college, no need to make the teacher mispronounce their name on the roster.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Sasha, Shannon, Lynn, and Lyndsey are ALL traditionally and historically BOY'S names!  And in some countries they are still more commonly boy's names than girl's names.  They have become common girl's names because a bunch of parents at some point in history beyond YOUR memory (mostly the Victorian era) decided to call their girls by "boy's" names.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't have a problem with "unisex" names or masculine names on girls.  Maybe it's because I have a feminine spelling of a unisex name (Gabrielle) and go by a masculine nickname (Gabe, because my mom HATED the nickname "Gabby" which incidentally she associated with a male that she did not like).  Since the name I go by except in extremely formal situations is a masculine name it does not seem at all strange to me for a girl to have a name that is generally considered masculine.  There are some names (even traditional unisex names) that I just don't like on girls and some names that I just don't like on boys...but generally I think that many names are ok on either gender.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sasha is originally a boys name - a nickname for Alexander. It's only been used for girls in the US for about 30 years. Shannon is traditionally a boys name in Irish - and was still in the top 100 names for boys in the 1970s. Lynn was a mans name before a woman. It is in the Social Security list as a top 500 mans name since 1880 when record began, but doesn't appear as a woman's name until the 1910s. Lindsey also appeared as a mans name in the Social Security charts from the 1880s and didn't appear in the top 1000 for women until the 1970s<br>  So basically all the girls named Shannon, Sasha, Lynn and Lindsey were all given boys names if they were born in the 1970s.<br>  <br>  Charlie is a nickname for Charlotte and Toni is a nickname for Antonia or Antoinette - both girls names|`|iJ9Ewxwtaa	i agree!  i used to be a school photographer, and i once saw a boy named molly!  i couldnt belive it!  I have also seen girls as: ethan, ryan, kyler, tristyn, and logan.  i personally dont like it.  however, it is not my baby to name, and who is to say a name is for "girls" or "boys"|`|U1h6Dntjaa	In Russian, Sasha is a nickname for Alexander. It is a boy's name.  What's actually annoying about parents naming their sons Sasha is that they're giving their sons a nickname instead of a full name.|`|e4M4uQXNaa	sometimes i hate it, sometimes it isn't so bad lol.  like a girl named Charlie - usually (i hope so anyway) her real name is Charlotte or something, and Toni is usually really an Antonia or Antoinette (although i really hate Toni as a nickname, for a boy or girl lol).<br>  <br>  also, when it's a boy having a 'girl' name, usually those names were originally male names anyway, like Leslie.<br>  <br>  plus, Sasha is a traditional Russian nickname for Alexander lol.  it would be different if his parents just named him like Laura or something haha.|`|0hxK0khKaa	It bothers me too... If you can't tell whether it's a boy or a girl, who shouldn't use the name. The only people I know named Sasha, Shannon, Lynn and Lyndsey are girls. And Tyler is a boy's name. Riley is being used on both, although it is originally a boy's name.Charlie and Toni are nicknames for Charlotte and Antonia, which are girl's names.<br>  <br>  I like very gender specific names like Samantha for a girl and Isaac for a boy.|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	I do understand what you mean.  I do not like gender-inappropriate names on kids.  Especially boy names on girls (Logan, Reese, Kendall, etc.)  Worse yet, some parents try to make such names more "feminine" by changing the spelling (usually adding a Y) or adding -lyn, for example.<br>  <br>  However, remember that some "gender-inappropriate" names are possibly not...  Sasha, Shannon, Lynn and Lyndsey for example ARE boys' names (taking the historical use of them into account).  Charlie and Toni could also just be nicknames (though in my experience they are also used mainly in the masculine sense).<br>  <br>  This is a much talked-about thing on here.  Welcome to the debate!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Sasha is a traditionally Russian diminutive of the name Alexander. Lyndsey was a masculine name BEFORE it was feminine. Same with Morgan, Ashley, Dana, etc.<br>  <br>  Riley and Toni are unisex. I don't like girls named Tyler or Charlie.|`|yCyw4RlQaa	I think that it is cute when girls have a boys name <br>  Well it really depends names such as:<br>  Dylan<br>  Jordyn<br>  Kamryn<br>  Hayden<br>  Taylor<br>  Boys names with girl names i do not like though|`|u5NOXJTuaa	Maybe they are terribly confused, can't read, dont see the problem, or are just 'free spirits'. whatever, i agree with you. i would kill myself if i was named Charlie...|`|kXjwAYh4aa	i know a boy named alexis. and always got teased but it more of the parents fault. it just depends if it hurts the kid or not.|`|28QPS6V9aa	So who gets to decide whether they are a "boy" or "girl" name? In many countries Shannon is considered a male name but in others it's female. I actually don't mind it too much. Parents have a right to name their kids whatever they please. It's funny you mentioned the names Shannon, Lyndsey and Tyler...my name is Lyndsey and I have a sister named Shannon and a brother named Tyler. :) You practically named my whole family.|`|wLzuCDmfaa	My friends name (A boy) is Gabrielle, pronounced like Gabriel, but he is often mistaken for a girl. Sometimes it's cute though. I have another friend (A girl) named James pronounced Jame - Ez. I hate boys with girls names, but girls with boys names is cute a lot. As long as there's no girls out there with the name Harold.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	I grew up with the name Bobbie, and I can tell you it's hard especially when people do not want to spell it right, and people call you a boy when you're a girl.  When i found out I was having a girl, I made sure she had a gender specific name.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Sasha IS a boys name in most countries.<br>  <br>  So are Shannon and Lindsay.<br>  <br>  But I havent got an oppinion on it, I like some boy names on girls.|`|B7nqTcttaa	I like some uni sex names. But most of them are traditional boys names for girls like Hunter, Blair or Quinn. I wouldn't call my boy a unisex name though, it really doesn't work.|`|61NKzPzMaa	I agree with you. I think it's horrible. It's not cute. It just makes the parent seem gender confused.|`|URvhlHmeaa	cause its different, who is anyone to decide what names cant be used for someone elses child?|`|DPZ5g3NCaa	there is such thing as unisex names wich all of the are
b6EyFLgUaa	mmhumm make sure you go during there nap and have a bottle/ or a blanket for breast feeding ready for when you go so that so that the sucking can stop the little ones ears from popping. It will be ok. Pack extra stuff and plenty of toys and extra formula if your going to use that and diapers ( or just buy diapers there). If you can afford it id spring for the fist class seats, there is more room and no one besides you two will be sitting in your row.<br>  <br>  EDIT- health wise he will be ok, be sure to bring along some Tylenol just in case. Also the tummy drops ( right now i dont remember the name) being a first time mommy is scary but you will regret it if you don't go to your sister in laws wedding as well. Think of the great time you will have, can take the little one swimming in the pool at your hotel ( its your stay in one) all the photos and everything.|`|VCCKfT3taa	I've heard that very ill or very pregnant people shouldn't fly because high altitude can affect your circulation or something, but I didn't hear anything about taking a healthy baby up. <br>  You might have to deal with some groans and dirty looks if your child start crying and won't stop, but that's about it. ^_^|`|CpWGvDvRaa	MUCH MUCH MUCH safer than driving! So, yes. :) Have a great time!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I took my daughter on a 4 hour flight at that age and she was fine :).|`|AA10976444	RElax...we just took our 4 month old to California from Vancouver Canada.  It was just over a 3 hour flight.  I found that giving the baby a bottle going up in the air helped his ears, and going down as well.  You are also fine with germs...you can't worry about germs all the time, or you will never get anywhere.  Shots don't stop all the diseases...they just make them more bearable if they do get them.  Shots don't cover all the strains of the diseases.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	of course -he can get sick in your own home!!|`|KDb96QS7aa	Oh my goodness, what would you think of me?! I have taken 2 cross country trips with my son and 2 half-cross country trips with him so far and he is 9 months old. We have 2 more half cross-country flights scheduled for him in the next 3 months!  My son has actually never been sick. He's had a very slightly runny nose twice and both times it lasted less than 12 hours so I don't really consider that "sick." He's never had a fever that I'm aware of.<br>  <br>  But I definitely see your point.  I'm admittedly a germophobe. I bring antibacterial wipes with me on the plane and wipe down anything I or my son might touch...the tray table, the seat belt, the window, the wall, everything.  I also bring a lot of hand sanitizer with me.  The only thing that bugs me is the guards at security sometimes have "patted down" my son with those nasty gloves on.<br>  <br>  Anyway, obviously my experience has been that you have nothing to worry about, so go have fun!|`|4yUUUkAsaa	I don't have any experience flying with babies, but I wouldn't recommend taking a baby to Vegas.  Think about the noisy, smoky casinos you have to walk through to get to the elevator to your room.  Then add in the fact that you can't gamble or go to a show with a baby.  About all you could really do would be to shop at places like Caesars forum shops and other malls, and you can probably do that at home.  Is there anyone you trust to keep the baby for a couple days? I love my kids to pieces, don't get me wrong.  Older kids (probably from about age 5 and up) can go to places like Circus Circus and have a blast, but if I were you I'd leave the baby at home.|`|n24githIaa	The baby won't know it's in a plane. :P<br>  Since he/she is so young, it'll probably sleep the entire time.<br>  But make sure to try to keep the baby quiet or other passengers might get upset at you. >.<<br>  When you can't get away from a crying baby, and nothing will make it shut up, it's quite annoying in my opinion. lol<br>  Good luck.<br>  I say take the baby on the plane.<br>  Way better than a 10+ hour trip in a car.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	yeah its safe i took my 4 month old to north carolina and i live in california. i was worried also about him getting sick and his ears popping on the plane but he was fine.. he was so good on the plane ride and he slept a lot .

We still saw our dad but it was not very often. <br>  <br>  The main reasons were because we lived in one town and my dad had moved nearly an hour away (to help a relative who had cancer). It was hard to arrange schedules and it was annoying to my sister and I to have to travel so often. Even though it was only an hour it seemed much longer to us when we were kids. <br>  <br>  I agree with you though, I don't know how some parent's can go without ever seeing their children. I know a woman who gave birth to her daughter, signed away her custody to the father, moved out of state, got married, and had another kid and she has never even had a visit with her daughter since signing away her rights. <br>  <br>  I could never imagine not seeing my kids.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I think men don't have the same reaction to their children that women do. Maybe it's hormones, I don't know, but it certainly seems that women have a far stronger attachment to their children.<br>  I used to have a friend who's boyfriend left her when she was heavily pregnant with their second. He never even found out if it was a boy or girl. or his name, or asked for pictures. He simply said that 'he didn't want that life anymore' and walked away. i could never understand it. But then again, my own mother has nothing to do with me or any of my siblings, and my youngest sisters are early teens and have been with my dad for years. I could never understand that either. Like every rule of thumb, there are exceptions.|`|50lIaC8zaa	I know what you mean. We wern't married but had been together for 4.5 yrs and we split when our DD was 1.5 yrs old and in 6 months he saw her 3 times, the last being on her 2nd birthday.<br>  <br>  Then i suddenly got a letter after numerous times of saying he was gonna come see her and not turning up saying he didn't want to see her anymore, needless to say by this time he had another GF and within a yr they were married and she was pregnant, he now has 2 other children and still hasn't seen his daughter and she is nearly 7 now.

I'm divorcing now and the jerk I was married to hasn't spoken to me or our son in 9 months.|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	The law is on the side of women.<br>  <br>  woman = Anglo Saxon for Womb man|`|7B6PxDzYaa	Well all I can do is give my experience of my son's father who has not seen him in over a year.  I was left in pregnancy and after him denying paternity to avoid CSA and was forced to pay.  He then got intouch at six months, I was quite happy about this.  However, he said he could only see his son once every 3 weeks for 2 hours and made out it was such an effort, although he stays less than a mile away. I let this go on and was even happy to invite him to christenings but he refused to meet priest and was just generally difficult.  I tried to get him to see his son more (quite fancied the idea of a baby sitter), every excuse was given no knowing children, no having a child friendly house and so on.  I bought him a travel cot offered that he could baby sit in my house while I go out, then his excuses were then work.  He made it quite clear it was really an inconvience so I said take your son for a day or overnight as is only once a fortnight to bond and he refused.  I then got annoyed and told him to pick up my son from my mother's for his two hours and he refused and hence never had a xmas card or birthday card since.  It is sad but I did try hard and became ill in the process of this.  My  son should have a father and I should have someone helping in the parenting.  <br>  <br>  My ex has never told anyone he works with he has a son and I have seen him on dating sites claiming he has no children but wants two.  <br>  <br>  Children are a responsibility and some people find that hard.  Men like this are really just silly boys.|`|NTfIJa7zaa	Good question and I do not understand the men/women that have nothing or little to do with their children's lives. My husband's father left him when he was around 5 years old and tried coming back into his life 25 years later. My husband says there is no excuse or anything that any man could ever say to him to make him understand their reasoning for doing this. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and is 100% a part of his son's life even though his ex wife has got to be the most irritating person to have to deal with.

oilECbKkaa	there are a lot of different effects to the development of the fetus or baby when a mother is smoking and has not stopped. the first and second trimester is the most crucial time of the baby's development... side effects of smoking can range from deformity to weak immune system to many different things.<br>  <br>  to answer your question, yes it is a possibility that it was caused by her not quitting...|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yes .. smoking may cause that 4 sure. an ob will tell u it may cause defects n disabilities|`|HAueVh8Naa	that just from not growing properly .if her baby was premature then yes he/she will be on oxygen .my mom smoked with all my sisters and me my oldest sister when she was born she weighed 4 pounds and was blue my other sister weiged 6 pounds and i was 5 pounds and due to my mom smoking .i have severe ashtma and chronic broncitis i cant do sports i can barely walk because of my asthma .you can not blame that on smoking it happens but if your pregnant you should not be smoking its only 9 months with out smokes i just think its sad because that baby is in the womb and smoking and doesnt have a choice|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, Your friends baby's condition could be caused from a number of things.Just because she smoked during her pregnancy,doesn't mean it was her fault.Babies are born with all different problems,even when the mother isn't a smoker.My little man had a tiny little whole in his heart from the way he was forming inside me,(there are no holes in my heart on either sides)im a smoker and its now completely healed over.Also my mum smoked with all 10 of us kids and all of us are fine with no conditions or anything.Smoking could be a part of the reason but it takes alot more besides smoking to harm a babies development.Good luck and congrats on her baby<br>  <br>  P.S. i smoked with my first son(i tired to quit) and my little man was healthy and is now a yr old.|`|DiuDO1Weaa	k so i have to answer this let me tell you something! have you ever heard of a chromisone disorder???<br>  k well look it up and i gurentee you will find a disorder that caused that because SMOKING DID NOT ASK any REAL DR THAT and they will tell you the same thing!<br>  EDIT......... you people who bag on smokers need to learn real fact's and quit watching the news i know a girl who was born with ashtma and guess what! her mother did not smoke ,drink,or do drugs now what do you have to say about it oh and she has COPD|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Incidentally, I have the same problem.

TE7foNwMaa	1 -- I prefer Malorie. I kind of can't help but think of "mallard" when I see Mallery. <br>  <br>  2 -- Mallery, Sarah, Cassia, and Rosaline (the last one). They're amazing. <br>  <br>  3 -- Desmond and Malorie -- I don't really like that spelling of Larraine... It's a pretty name, but I do like Malorie / Mallery better. <br>  <br>  Bryce and Rosaline -- I love Rosaline. It's absolutely gorgeous. Sarah is a bit too common for me, but it's also a pretty name... I love Rosaline so much more though. <br>  <br>  Julian and Cassia -- I love Cassia, it's absolutely gorgeous. You've heard my opinions on Sarah and Larraine. Larraine would be my second choice, though. <br>  <br>  Owen and Rosaline -- I adore Rosaline. It's a gorgeous name. But I also like Holly and Lilibeth. <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay, good luck! :)<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|bT4npA7Jaa	1. I don't like either, really. Though, I love Mallory or Mallorie.<br>  <br>  2.

RzYePezkaa	I understand why your worried but it is perfectly normal I remember with my first I had this and at times one of my nipples would have like a white crust on it sorry if tmi I asked my doctor about and he said that it happens with first pregnancies a lot you body and breasts will change constantly do not worry everything will develop fine when your little one gets here there will be no problem breast feeding with both breasts.Good luck and congrats.
yp9rEMSraa	Because of your age the percentage of getting pregnant will jump....being younger you can conceive easier....I would advise waiting cause you are still young but if you want to get prego go for it....I would start taking prenatal vitamins, eatting healthier, exercising and maybe taking a supp to make sure you are more fertile....your boyfriend i would have him stop smoking, drinking, and taking hot showers or baths to try and keep his sperm count up|`|f0otK4zQaa	because of your age you are in the best age category for conceiving, i think i read it was 25- 30 % chance a month. tips are the usual be healthy, pre natal vitamins, lots of fresh healthy food and of course lots of sex. i am also ttc and i am having a herb called angus castus which helped me conceive my first child.<br>  good luck|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	have sex every other day, not every day, he should wear boxer shorts, not take hot baths and sit on hot things...<br>  <br>  he should be on top and you can put a pillow underneath your bum to elevate and lie down for at least 20 minutes, gravity you know?

8dpZpH0Saa	Well um Im not a boy. But sure they do! They are not only for girls it somewhere where they can write down their feelings.

In terms of boys older than that though, it probably depends on the individual. As a lot of other answerers have shown, a lot either don't keep a diary, or won't admit to it, and those who do tend to prefer referring to it as a 'journal' - I guess it sounds more masculine; 'diary' tends to be associated more with pre-teen girls. <br>  <br>  I think for boys a diary probably takes a different form to those which most girls keep - I know some guys who have a notebook in which they write song lyrics, ideas, and things like that, which I suppose is just another form of journal, just different from the 'Dear Diary, today I did this...' format that people often tend to think of. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend used to keep a diary when he was in his mid-teens, although I think that he's fairly embarrassed by the fact now, and is certainly embarrassed by its contents. But I think its good to have something like that to look back on when you're older, for example when you have children yourself and you want to remember what you were like when you were their age, or even if you just want a laugh and to remember how far you've come since when you were younger! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|hzQDocWaaa	don;t think so|`|71wBNgbnaa	I'm not a boy, but I do have a journal.

QoenvlFuaa	Tell your doctor everything you just told us here, and ask if he/she would schedule an induction. Each doctor has his/her own criteria as to what he/she will induce for (I know that sounds crazy, but it is true). You mentioned something about problems with a heart valve; I don't know anything about it but that sounds like something that could be a "medical necessity" to get induced. Just so you know, while I don't think inducing is the greatest thing, it would be better than scheduling a C/S. Avoid a C/S if at all possible.<br>  <br>  Be completely honest with your doctor about these concerns and see what he/she thinks is best for your particular situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Most doctors will only induce if its medically necessary and if you're at least 39 weeks, and the uterus is no longer safe.  Ask your doctor about it at the next appointment.|`|58G7ZAJpaa	It depends on the doctor, etc.  Most will not schedule a delivery unless it is medically seen to do so.  <br>  <br>  - trust me, I want my husband home from Iraq for the birth of our baby.  BUT, if the baby decides to come early, there's no stopping him.  He knows when the time is right for him.<br>  <br>  Speak to your doctor the next time you see them.  Let them know ALL of your fears and concerns.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck to you!

Tell someone, this kid is probably being used.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Tell someone he won't leave you alone and you would like something done about it.|`|fNv2Re6baa	Its important to stay calm and not to retaliate because you can then get in just as much trouble as him.<br>  <br>  Sometimes kids with problems feel self-concious and so worried about what other people will think of them that they scare and hurt others to make themselves look tough and forget whats hurting on the inside.<br>  <br>  Try to think of it from his point of view. Maybe at home he is abused or sexually assaulted. You don't know about kids backgrounds until you really get to know them. Just remember to be nice to him anyway. Talk to someone about it and tell and teacher you can trust. Ask the teacher to talk to him about it but not make it look like you 'dobbed' on him, but rather that the teacher noticed themselves what was going on.<br>  <br>  Ignore him it gets worse and make sure that you are talking to someone about it. Remember to keep your cool, and you won't get in trouble too. Try and relate to him and think of what its like in his shoes. Maybe he's even worried that people will like you better them him and therefore sees you as a threat. Just be nice, keep your cool and don't let it bother you.|`|i4DhPvjFaa	I understand you think you're being bullied by this kid, but by calling him 'retarded' online is also bullying. Two wrongs don't make a right Josh. Maybe because of this boys special needs he acts out in a way that seems like he's putting you down. Or maybe he really is intending to bully you. I would talk to your teacher about it.|`|in7qi4oZaa	I can see where you are coming from. When people just keep picking and the anger just builds up to the point that you just want to get a metal baseball bat and bust their skull in. You can not let this get to you. Just ignore him.
3jq6K9DZaa	Other than an ultasound scan,no other scan is recommended. The only pain killer you can take is paracetamol. If you are is alot of pain, go to the hospital and im sure they will figure out a way that is best to see whats going on and how to treat itn without causing ur baby any harm. good luck x|`|HPRlEWu1aa	If you are pregnant or could be pregnant at the time of your scan appointment, please call us early so we can discuss the situation with you and consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  MRI causes a slight heating of your body, so most MRI sites avoid scanning during the first 3 months of pregnancy unless the diagnosis cannot wait and the only alternate test uses X-rays. Beyond that period, MRI is still avoided if the diagnosis can wait till your child is born as a matter of extreme caution. In many sites around the world MRI is used to examine pregnant women and their babies to avoid the need for X-ray tests.<br>  <br>  MRI contrast is not used during pregnancy.|`|ACyrJQHOaa	MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses magnetic and radio waves, meaning that there is no exposure to Xrays or any other damaging forms of radiation. Typically not done in the first trimester as precaution, however, no evidence to suggest it being harmful if done then. Personally i don't think its worth the risk.Good luck|`|BdE4GquHaa	You really should call the hospital to ask, im sure it would be fine but just check to see and if they dont think it is then im sure they can do some scan or blood test or something to determine if any damage has been caused.

gx4s68s8aa	I would tell him in a very calm way, that any comments about your "female areas" are not appropriate.  And that brushing  up against you isn't nice either.  You have your personal space and he is interfering with that.  Try to be as clear as you can, but also without emotion. He is old enough that you should be able to tell him this and have him understand. <br>  <br>  If the problem doesn't fix itself then you should discuss this with your boss.  She can tell you if she would like to handle it herself or have your talk to the parents directly.<br>  <br>  I am sure (at least I hope) he is not trying to be as crude as he is being.  He might have had some bad role models in his life.  But regardless this is totally unacceptable behavior.  If he wasn't as young as he is then it would definitely be sexual harassment.  And so for your interests and his interest it needs to stop ASAP.  He needs to learn his lesson now, before he really gets in trouble.|`|a8IRxC4raa	why are you pretending it doesn't bother you?

lnsOJ3GBaa	It absolutely makes sense. Its a great question. There is nothing more frustrating as a teenager to have an adult blow off with a "you can't possibly know what love is" Truth is adults don't know it because their older. It's not some button that's pushed in  your brain when you turn 21 that automatically gives you all the secrets of love. and telling a kid they don't know what love is, is absurd. <br>  <br>  Everyone is capable of love, you start with your parents and as you get older your siblings, cousins, friends,  and such and when you become teenagers, you start dating. This is where you're introduced to infatuation which is confused for love as much by adults as it is with teenagers. <br>  <br>  The only advantage that adults have over Teens is time. Love enters a whole new level when you live someone day in and day out and have a true partnership with them. A life partnership. When you mesh well together and build a life with one another and even a family. That is the kind of love you don't know yet because you haven't been alive long enough to have that life experience. It doesn't mean you don't know what love is more than adults it just means that you're life experience hasn't allowed you the opportunity to witness intensity, such unconditional feeling. The sad thing is that many people in this world won't experience this either not even as adults. I hope this helps you a bit. Good Luck and God Bless.|`|dbf8Afhoaa	I think most of the time (not all the time) when you are a teenager, you have "loves" but they aren't REAL (marriage) loves. And as you get older and experience more relationships, you find out that the previous relationships weren't real love.<br>  <br>  Love has nothing to do with age. It's all about maturity and experience.|`|3oSQQt6maa	I think love could be felt by anyone who understands how to love and how to show love. Whether teeneger or adult, if you are in love, then you are in love. Age doesn't matter.|`|b5F9XVyQaa	I agree. Teenagers don't know what love is. the think its about kissing, having sex and other thing when its really not. Love is when you care about someone.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I think you mature a lot more by the time your an adult.|`|AXEqOEloaa	You live and learn.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	i think what your getting at is how can an adult love as they dont know what love is compared to elderly people?<br>  just like adults say it to teens?<br>  <br>  i think teens can love<br>  but love changes as you get older<br>  which is why adults will say to a teen 'you dont love them, you dont know what love is'|`|J3H3C5ksaa	I think it really easy to love-even crushes-but you can fall out of love easily too. =)|`|I64JOuMKaa	I KNOW RIGHT ?! EXACTLY !<br>  <br>  when you actually think you love your boyfriend/girlfriend<br>  someone comes along and tells you<br>  " you don't know what LOVE is .. you're just a teeenager , you can't know what love is "<br>  <br>  I believe<br>  we DO , know what love is but its a teeanger kinda of love<br>  there's love on different levels<br>  just because we're adults doesn't mean we don't experience some sort of love<br>  I think I loved my last boyfriend .. it may not be the love you're thinking of but to me, it was some sort of love<br>  <br>  I'll probably love someone x 23098420 when i'm an adult<br>  I think thats when I will know im in love with someone.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  if any of that makes sense LOL<br>  <br>  good luck and thanks =)|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Oh ok. Yeah, I see your point. It doesn't make any sense, but my guess would be is testing the waters and getting some experience so that way only you know how you feel, no matter what adult tries to tell you.|`|F3iEnj2Caa	Good Point. (:<br>  I think teenage "love" serves as kind of like "practice" for when you are an adult. It teaches you how to treat relationships seriously.|`|PFT4T5Craa	Your question doesn't make any sense.

znW4b0Mfaa	Someone said here a minute ago to have "constant intercourse".<br>  Do not do that!!!His sperm count will be too low to get you pregnant fi you do it that way.<br>  Trust me,I went thru 2 years of fertility treatments,my specialist said even if a guy has awesome sperm,you cannot make love daily!!<br>  Actually,if his count is good,ev ery other day is best.<br>  Sperm can live in our uterus up to 5 days.So it is not necessary to do it daily.|`|JEkAPI6paa	Go to your local chemist and buy an ovulation test. you can get packs of about seven for about $25 or you can get a reusable one for about $65 but I would reccomend the $25 dollar one. Also try and have sex everyday (I'm sure your boyfriend will appreciate) or at least every 48 hours so you'll always have seamen waiting for your egg to be released. because you've been on the pill your cycle might be a bit topsy turvy (I tended to skip my period when I was on it so everything was messed up when I went off it) so your body might not release an egg exactly two weeks after your period, so its important to constantly check with the ovulation tests and have constant intercourse. I hope I could help! love ash|`|AA10564328	there are some sites that can help you know when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  www.whenmybaby.com<br>  www.mymonthlycycles.com<br>  <br>  just keep track of all you previous periods and the sites should help

Yes she could be pregnant|`|e7SYtaIJaa	Your gonna be a dad dude.|`|NMKmmi5haa	Absolutley she could be pregnant! Wait 2 weeks and get her to do a test...and not to be preachy but to save you in the long run maybe you should sit down with her and talk about what would you do if she actually became pregnant...it's always a possibility and you need to be ready for it if you're going to be sexually active...|`|TY2v2lkLaa	sometime's womans menstrual cycle is not always on track due to lots of exercise, or lack of, or diet or stress so YES she could be pregnant!!!!|`|IcYXQlf9aa	absolutely- there is no "safe" time or position to have unprotected sex without risk of pregnancy|`|XZcCnhblaa	yes she can. anytime you have unprotected sex it can happen|`|eo0DKI0qaa	Yep- but you shouldn't be having sex with someone that young|`|lAQskxoLaa	She sure can be pregnant.|`|3oSQQt6maa	yes she can be pregnant. test!!|`|weu4Ip99aa	UGH!

ewagsnW4aa	i was raised christian and sort of strayed away to not being a part of any organized religion, but still hold some values in tact.<br>  <br>  i have a 3 yr old daughter and so far we have told her about god and she occasionally attends church with my parents, but other than that i have not begun to push her towards a religion. i figure when the time is right i will allow her to believe what she feels is right for her and not force her into anything.<br>  <br>  just as long as its nothing creepy like scientology!|`|1s3nddaYaa	im agnostic. so when my son starts going to school and he sees kids around the neighborhood that goes to church and he wants to go then i will let him go . i went church when i was in 1st grade and-5th grade, then just started going on weds. so i haven't giving my son a religion when he gets old enough he can decide on his own.|`|wZAeBisbaa	We baptized our kids in the protestant church of which we are members. We took them to Sunday school and confirmation, but we never forced those activities on them.  They chose to continue, and sometimes they ended up bringing us to church because they wanted to go!  When they were teenagers, they made their own decisions about religion.  Two of them have taken religion courses in college and have given some serious thought to religions and beliefs.  One of those two still attends church regularly, the other does not.  Our third has not gone to college yet, but is very active in our church.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	i was raised lutheran as my parents, but when i was raising a child w/ my gf, her mother, we raised her w/ no religion.  however, if she had ever felt the need to learn/believe/join a church, i would have tried to offer her that exposure after talking w/ her mother. as it turns out, she didn't, still doesn't, and isn't a very respectful, moral or decent kid.  i'm not saying to have to believe in god to be decent, but it's a good way to teach children something that many parents these days don't & don't  know how to.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My husband and I don't really have a religion and what we do believe in is different from one another. So as my daughter grows she will learn what I believe, and what my husband believes. My daughter does to church with her great grandma sometimes, and with her grandma as well ( different religions) if my daughter is interested in a religion Ill support her in that and bring her to the place of worship ( if thats allowed) so she can witness what the religion is like.|`|rBq189W1aa	I don't believe religion should be forced on a child before they're old enough to decide for themselves.<br>  <br>  I do, however, believe in teaching my kids how to spell. It's a shame your parents didn't share that 'beleaf'.|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	Most people will get their children baptized early because if anything were to happen before they're old enough to make up their own mind, we would fear the thought that they were in hell because of us. But, this is not what causes you to go to hell anyway. I think your mother did the best thing for you. If you look at everyone who has been baptized before understanding what life is about, you'll notice many of them aren't religious or believers now. <br>  <br>  I would not give my children a religion. I would teach them different religions and allow them to make up their mind as to what they believe to be true.|`|0LKfIdS4aa	I wasn't raised with any specific religous beliefs, but I from school I learned the basics of Christianity,

94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	It depends on what state you live in - laws regarding consent and age are different all over the place. In some states (for instance NJ) you'd be fine with no legal trouble for your boyfriend. In others (such as California), he'd be in a lot of trouble. <br>  <br>  Check this list for your state: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_con...</a>|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	What state do you live in? In the US it varies depending on where you live. In most states 17 is above the legal age of consent, so you should be okay, but not everywhere.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Yes they can if they want to be assholes about it.  By law its still statutory rape.  Sad but honestly parents who don't "approve" will do this just because they're not happy about the situation and then the guy is stuck with a "predator" title over his head.  Do him a favor and wait until you're 18 if your planning to get pregnant...especially if you think your parents are going to be foul about it.  AND if you do get pregnant now and then later admit it after 18 they can go back and file charges...my friend is dealing with this situation now...his baby's mom is 19 now but she was 16 when he was 21 and she lied about her age, got pregnnat after one night and got pissy about him moving on....be warned.  His life is hell fighting to keep them from filing charges and it will only get worse if they do. (living in San Antonio, TX)|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	So you want to be a teen mom? Why? You need to be more responsible and use your brain. Babies aren't like the dolls you used to play with, they are a 24 hour job that doesn't care if you are tired, sick, or emotionally ready to be a parent, all they want is to be taken care of.

TE7foNwMaa	I think it's perfectly fine to use a popular name. <br>  <br>  For one thing, this name is actually much less popular than many other names (it's only #28 for 2008). <br>  <br>  Also, even the number one most popular name will only be used on about 1% of the United States' population. There are a lot more names to choose from nowadays, unlike in the early times when there were an extreme amount of people names John, Mary, Katherine, etc. So, the popularity of names isn't much of an important thing. <br>  (<a href="http://appellationmountain.net/2009/02/25/in-defense-of-emma-and-ethan-ten-good-reasons-to-use-a-common-name/#more-1389)" rel="nofollow">http://appellationmountain.net/2009/02/2...</a><br>  <br>  So, I definitely think Jaedon is fine.<br>  <br>  As for middle names, you could try...<br>  Jaedon Andrew<br>  Jaedon Henry<br>  Jaedon Shane<br>  Jaedon Douglas /or Dallas<br>  Jaedon Rhett<br>  Jaedon Bennett<br>  Jaedon Spencer<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Or, you could always use a name after someone that is important to you, which I think is always great. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

wWkfASTNaa	Most people dont start showing until about 16 weeks or later, so it is pretty normal. My sister didnt show at all until 6 months along, but I am only 5 weeks and already my jeans dont fit LOL As for sleeping on your tummy, I would check with a doc for sure, but here is an answer on the web I found earlier, because I am a tummy sleeper, so I worry about this too,<br>  <a href="http://www.netwellness.org/question.cfm/31958.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netwellness.org/question.cfm/...</a><br>  and an U/S is the only way to chek the sex, althoug there are alot of fun old wives tales about telling the sex LOL|`|p0prrzf2aa	well your over weight so i doubt you would show much. <br>  <br>  it won't harm your baby, he/she has lots of cushioning. you'll know what your having at your u/s.<br>  <br>  <br>  or try an old wives tale, get a necklace with a ring on it, hold it over your belly, if it swings side to side its a boy, in circles its a girl|`|BIDy92Dwaa	If your belly is flat you can still sleep on your belly.<br>  When you go in for your 20 week U/S scan you can find out the gender then.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	You're a bit bigger than most so your belly won't show until later. Mine didn't really bulge out properly till about 6months. I'm over 200 lbs too.<br>  I always slept on my tummy until my belly got too hard to lay comfortably on. If you have to turn onto your side get a pillow and wedge between you and the mattress. You can then lean into the pillow, still quite comfortably.<br>  as for the sex, you can only find out at your ultrasound, unless you have a strong feeling either way - a gut feeling. I did with both of mine and I was right both times!|`|h5cFkP35aa	very normal. i started out at 170 lbs and i didnt start showing until 6 months. <br>  <br>  it's best to sleep on your side but if your belly isn't out there yet it's not going to harm the baby. and the only way to tell is ultrasound or to try the 'intelligender' thing. good luck.|`|AztPvbauaa	yes very normal|`|AA12073774	To answer your questions, first your may or may not show depending on your body, since everyones body is different. You should be okay lying on your stomach I wouldn't be too concerned. Also you should be able to find out the sex of your unborn baby at your ultrasound which is usually around midway through your pregnancy, depending if the little one lets you. Good luck with everything!|`|zNSDHpV6aa	yes normal i am 210 and i am not showing yet <br>  <br>  i dont think it will hurt the baby but it up to god is it a girl or boy
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It means that you are probably early in pregnancy. If had a lot of beverages it might be make it so your urine was more watery. The more time that you wait before testing, the more concentrated your urine would be with HCG. <br>  If your first test was positive, more then likely you are pregnant. Its more likely for you to have a false negative then a false positive.<br>  If the tests were different brands, it could have been that one was more sensitive then the other as well. <br>  Congratulations on your pregnancy.|`|T48smu01aa	that means wait a couple days and take another test or go to the doctors and get a blood test done...not all pregnancy test are 100%.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Just go to planned parenthood....it's free there...|`|CFFuFof1aa	You can always get a false negative test, but you can never get a false positive test. Yey!!! You are pregnant. Your levels are probably just too low and thats why the other one didn't pick it up. Go to your doctor and have them check the hcg levels in your blood to make sure they are where they are supposed to be!!! Congrats.<br>  Also, if you took one, and then took the other one right after you had just peed on the other one. Your HCG levels were too low. That's why they tell you to use the morning's pee, because your HCG levels  have been sitting in your pee and are stronger. If you had just peed and tried to pee again or had peed with in two or three hours of testing that could have been it too.|`|1BeKAfS6aa	not all pregnancy tests are 100% correct. The best thing u can do is to either go to ur doctor or get another pregnancy test|`|d4w2c68baa	well you might need to take a blood test to be more sure than the test<br>  and if you are congrats!
CbKOO4HFaa	Yes, they are fine and will not hurt your baby.  I rented one from heartones.com when I was 10 weeks pregnant for $22 per month (it's a lot cheaper than buying one and you can rent it month-to-month).  My hubby found the baby's heartbeat in a couple of minutes -- we started out way too high on my belly and finally found it once he moved the doppler lower.  It was so wonderful to hear it!  I had had a little spotting and even though my doc checked me out and said I was fine, I was still so nervous.  The doppler really helped calm my nerves and I would recommend it to anyone.  heartones.com isn't the only company that rents them, but I'm happy with the one I got.  I considered buying one from Babies R Us, but I heard that they do not work because it is a microphone, not a doppler.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	there ok i bought mine in the pharmacy so id say if there were any risks they would tell us. i got one this week and its unreal been able to hear the baby move around and hear the heartbeat. they are well worth the money. <br>  congrats on your pregnancy : )|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Obviously it's ok. The Doctor uses a fetal doppler to hear your baby's heartbeat|`|BIDy92Dwaa	haha you noob.<br>  if doctors used them obviously they would be ok to use.<br>  P.S why would you want one for yourself? You are not trained to 'find' the babys heartbeat, you will worry because you cannot find it half the time and rush off to the ER because you think your baby is dead and waste the midwives time when they have better things to do than tell you that your baby is still alive.<br>  DONT BUY ONE NOOB

IuzaNq2Uaa	Isn't that always the way? The unusual or rare name you've liked forever ends up being really popular by the time you're ready to have a baby! I've heard this complaint so many times on here from so many women.<br>  <br>  I would say, go ahead and use it. You will be able to tell your little Freya that you chose her name carefully and loved it since you were younger, while all the other Freyas just got called that because it was popular at the time and probably named after the band or the video game characters or something. <br>  <br>  Another thing you could do is use the original spelling of Freyja or something like that, if you are absolutely determined to be different.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	If you've always wanted to use it (and still do) then go ahead, don't let a bunch of statistics stop you. I think Freya is a gorgeous name as well, so I'd fully recommend using it.|`|X5H8RHH1aa	Freya (Freja) Is the Norse goddess of fertility so it's a very beautiful name, most people don't know where it's from though =) I've always though of it as a name for my children. As of yet I only know one person in the UK called Freja and spelt witth the J (Scandinavian spelling) so it is a rather rare name in the UK. <br>  She IS Scandinavian though.|`|F44b2np9aa	Freya is a lovely name and i would still use it, it is not like it is number one! But if you did wish to consider alternatives how about Evie (Evelyn), Liliana (lily) or Erica. CHoose a name you love and your daughter will love it too:)|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love the name Freya!|`|ebnjFMpKaa	Think about whether it is really going to bother you in the future. I am called Freya and I love it, I especially like it because there is a special story behind why my parents chose my name for me. I think it is a very pretty name yet it does sometimes bug me how there seem to be so many more little Freyas now. However, I still do get people commenting on how nice and unusual it is sometimes. If the popularity does bother you, think about other alternative spellings like Freyja and Freia that aren't becoming as common. It's not silly to worry about the popularity, I know what you mean, it is annoying when you love a name and everyone starts to love it at the same time but I think Freya is starting to fall in numbers a bit now. I haven't met any new babies called it for a while! Good luck and I hope this helps! xx|`|MKC3CnqHaa	I too feel that way about names - even if I am crazy about the name, I won't call my child that if a million other people are also going to call their kids that.  I don't want it to stand out necessarily, but I don't want it to be a boring name in 10 or 20 years time.<br>  <br>  So yes, if I were you, I'd look for possible alternatives.  If this is bugging you now, it's going to bug you for many many years to come, if you call your child that.<br>  <br>  (It IS a lovely name, by the way!).|`|oqhF2Gsaaa	If it has been your favourite name forever, use it!! Who cares about the popularity? I [I am 15 though and not pregnant] have LOVED the name Ava for like 4 years and now its so popular. Same with the name Rosalie, now it is all ridiculous because of Twilight, but they are still my favourite names and I would call my kids that if I had them now because I have loved them for so long.|`|iqku0QOQaa	i personally don't know one person called Freya if that helps! i didn't think it was that popular, always thought it was unusual but in a good way :) i would say go for it, since you've always liked it. x|`|3oSQQt6maa	Yes it is silly. You name your child the way you choose not just because of statistics you are going to choose a different name.<br>  I always wanted to name my first son alex, and in the U.S they are millions of Alexs' But that didn't stop me.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	I don't like that name very much, I'm biased though.  My names Dreya so of course I'm going to like mine better.

Personally, i've never heard the name Freya. I think it is an interesting and different name.

Use it!
TE7foNwMaa	Well, a lot of the people here will be biased against the name because they've never met a Zeeray. <br>  <br>  In the beginning days, most people will lean against unique names because they don't expect to meet someone with that name....it's not as predictable. But as the person gets to know your child, people will definitely learn to love his name because of his personality. <br>  <br>  So, people online aren't going to even try to picture anyone named Zeeray, it'll just hit home that they haven't heard it, and there won't be anything else that matters to them. <br>  <br>  Yes, it is a unique name, and yes, some people will think that it's terrible...but others will find it one-of-a-kind and special...hopefully you're one of those people.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't take to heart too much of what people online say (myself included), because they're most likely people that you'll never meet, and people that are biased against certain styles. <br>  <br>  My personal opinion of Zeeray...well, I don't think it's "so terrible", but it's not one that I would personally use. I think Ray would be a brilliant nickname for it, and I really like that. Zee would be okay, also. I think it has a lot of great features, but it's not one that I myself would readily use. <br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about it. I know many kids with extremely odd names that surprisingly embrace having such a weird name... Like one my best friend's family...she has sisters named Charli, Stormy, and Punky...and brothers named Scooter, Scooner, Tracer, Racer, and Chaser. But so far, they all love having different names, and wouldn't trade their names for anything. Even Punky. <br>  <br>  Also, don't worry about your kid being made fun of in school. There are very few children that actually make fun of names, and those would be kids that belong to the absolute name nerds that have nothing better to do than to tell their children what the characteristics of a "normal" name are. Most children grow up thinking that their classmates have perfectly normal names, unless they're told any different. I grew up having a friend named Metney, and I always thought it was a perfectly normal name. But I didn't think names like Collin were normal at all, because I didn't know any of them. <br>  <br>  So, the "your kid will be made fun of in school" excuse is really a myth. A rather false myth at that. Kids don't stereotype names like we do, they get to know a person and base their opinions of people on their personalities and likes / dislikes. I suppose it would be much better if some people learned from them...it's a rude thing to stereotype a name, because these names obviously mean a lot to the parents, and that's all that matters. <br>  <br>  So, I think Zeeray is fine. It has many accessible nicknames and isn't half as odd as the current celebrity names. As long as it means something to you, other peoples' stereotypical opinions aren't too important. :)<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|ZQyAlNhjaa	If you like it, great. Don't be upset. I think it's cute too. I think people probably think it sounds a bit like a rapper name at first, but do not let them hold you back! I think it's adorable and unique. That's a good thing!! : )|`|dW4DbkCLaa	Call him by his middle name. Hopefully it is much better than Zeeray. It does sound like a rapper. Actually, Zee or Ray by themselves would be ok. I prefer Ray.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Yes. It's horrible and so made up. Name your next one X-Ray.|`|ih2RV0pJaa	yeah it's pretty bad.<br>  why didn't you consult someone who would tell you the truth?<br>  zeeray sounds like a mantaray er something. not a little boy's name.<br>  <br>  if you can please change it & don't feel upset.<br>  at least you've realized the name is bad. some people name their kids the strangest things and don't even care.|`|lkX9RszWaa	Yes, change the name. For the kid's sake. <br>  <br>  At least you feel bad about it. Some people are smug for giving their kids bad names.  But it's an honest mistake. Don't beat yourself up about it, just get the name changed so your child can have a normal life.|`|oxYnFxhvaa	Unfortunatly it is terrible! It sounds like some kind of military laser gun designation. What you need to do is change it.|`|VPSZuzevaa	aww i like that name it sounds so cool like a famous persons babies name i wish i named my kid that but there name is Alix|`|5OJ5WUUdaa	Its horrible|`|1s3nddaYaa	i like it. my sons name is sephiroth... not my choice and surely a stupid choice. i was drugged up and his dad is a smooth talker.  some people like and others dont.i like the name Zeeray... its unique. i call my son Brayden though... a lot of people have different names these days.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yeah that's a a pretty horrible name.
222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	Are we over-reacting about this? No, you made the right decision.  Don't second-guess yourselves.|`|a8IRxC4raa	Yes, you made the right decision.<br>  <br>  Your daughter was dancing in a sexual way, which is inappropriate for her age, even if "everyone was doing it."  She also disobeyed you.<br>  <br>  You are not punishing her harshly at at.  She was told not to do dance like this.  She needs a consequence.  If you don't carry through, she can count on you to not carry through the next time she behaves inappropriately.<br>  <br>  Having limits and following through on consequences is the most loving thing you can do for your daughter.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	no, let it go, punishing her for this will only make her more rebellious. how do you know how she was dancing? one other question, was she grinding by herself like I did when I was in middle school, or was in grinding against a boy? Don't go down this road. Instead say<br>  "sweetie, i know going to ______'s bar mitzvah is important to you, so Daddy and I are going to let you go, but when you dance provokatively you may give out the wrong impression.|`|Lor20kXcaa	Personally, she was just dancing. <br>  <br>  You've stopped her from seeing her best friends coming of age...on what.<br>  <br>  The fact that someone said she was kind of grinding a bit on the dance floor?<br>  <br>  She was just dancing. I can understand if she was making out with boys, but she was just dancing !!<br>  <br>  Personally, i think you're over-reacting. You're banning her from someting extremely important, when you don't even know what she did.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	i think your defintely over reacting, all teen parties have grinding in it. Its normal, every dance party with dancing and teens will have grinding. these are the facts. Its not a big deal<br>  <br>  o wait actually i change my mind i didnt realize you said 7th grader, tht means shes twelve right tht is a little weird. I would think it to be ok if she was 14 but 12 is way young.|`|62Tn86MCaa	The fact that you are asking this question reveals that you are a concerned parent with good motives. You must love your child. Go with your gut. Parenting is hard.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	I think you are over punishing her only because you should have set down what a punishment would be when you forbade her to grind anymore. As it is, the punishment she received before was a grounding and likely was what she expected to receive should she be punished again, since you had set precedent. So she should be grounded again but not from her best friend's bat mitzvah.<br>  <br>  From now on you should make known the punishment she'll get for something you feel would be a wrongful action on her part. That way she'll be aware of the consequences should she go astray.|`|kFk8kokCaa	i dont think it is harsh. you daughter needs to learn appropriate behavior. just cuz everyone else is doing it doesnt mean its ok. it is definately inappropriate to be dancing like that at a "family type" get together. and she is only 7th grade.. she shouldnt be doing it at all. i have a 7th grader and hell no would i allow him to behave like that(knowingly)|`|doha66YWaa	I was about to say that if she was just dancing, it's not so bad, but then I saw this:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(dance)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(d...</a>|`|in7qi4oZaa	It is up to the parents. If you feel that it is very inappropriate then that is your choice.|`|lwFo3IWtaa	I think your an over controlling ***** who are you to tell someone how to dance? Even if she is your daughter? she was grinding, so what?|`|LSJyE4d0aa	I do think you are being a little harsh|`|g9vw4ovGaa	That is how kids dance now, its all on what they see on tv. But, you warned her, you told her not to do it again, she blatantly disobeyed you, follow through with your punishment. Yes, I think you over reacted in the punishment process, but now it's done, so follow through. I think it is good that you are teaching your daughter self respect, my daughter is 16 months old and seen the new Beyonce video and started shaking her butt around. I can't wait for what is to come (uggh) Good luck, and don't ever judge you're own parenting, you're doing a fine job, she'll be angry for a while. In the end she'll respect you more.|`|r9DTARhwaa	wow i'm in the same grade as her and she's already freaking? -.- not very nice....<br>  i think that grounding her is not over reacting. grinding is not an appropriate dance for her age. if she were 18 and up the sure but she's only 12/13 o.0.<br>  and just because 'every ones' doing doesn't mean that she has to. following the 'trends' is a waste of time because they'll just be gone by the next  day. and as some kids do as soon as they're off being grounded they'll get in trouble again with the same thing unfortunately. <br>  and why was she a a bar? o.0<br>  isn't that bad influence for her to be their with people that dance that way?|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I will say that yes you over-reacted, and while I find it fine for you to look at it as grounding her.  Instead of grounding her from the next bat mitzvah why not ground her for two or three weeks, if the bat mitzvah is in the middle of that time she can go out to it, but has to make up that day on the tail end.  I understand the idea of grounding her, but grounding her witnessing a religious right of passage from a friend, may be a bit too much.|`|FixQ5mjWaa	instead of punishing her, show her videos of kids grinding on youtube then she can see how ridiculous it looks, explain to her it isn't tasteful, and makes her look like a little hooch. :)  or read her some of the responses on here so she can see that we as adults are viewing her as something that she should feel embarrassed to be. <br>  <br>  She's just trying to fit in i'm sure but i hate seeing kids dancing like that, its so...wrong? It's dryhumping.|`|MRV9rNyjaa	NO i dont think you are over reacting to this. it is your job as a parent to teach your child right and wrong. i think that is the problem these days, with so many younger people getting pregnant. parents dont know how to disapline their children. i mean when you are "grinding" isnt that just another form of sex, but with your clothing on?where is it going to lead to next? she has to learn its not right for a 7th grader, or a 13 year old to dance like that.|`|QkC7DsFKaa	in seventh grade we were grinding at dances. My rents nvr told me not to tho. u made a line and she crossed it. u were right to punish her- she broke the rules. I do think that seventh grade is young- it was towards the end of the year tht stuff started to happen- dances seem to get more sexual as the year progresses:(|`|oJO7jr3Faa	being a parent u feel like you have this responsibility but  you need to let tyou kid learn on her own just guide her.. i think you should let her go and warn her that she will be grounded if she does it there|`|mupe6lOEaa	stop being so hard on your kid give her a break instead u should take away some of her computer time that would be perfect|`|pOsV0Tu2aa	This is a hard case because she disobeyed your rules but a bat mitzvah is one of the most important things that will happen in her best friend's life.<br>  <br>  But for that reason she shouldn't dance inappropriately at it because that would disrespect her friend. Even if her friend "grinds", she'd still be disrespecting her friend's family.<br>  <br>  So I guess in conclusion you made the right choice.<br>  <br>  If I had a bat mitzvah when I turned 12/13 (they can be held at either age) I wouldn't have wanted people dancing that way even if they were my best friend.|`|w9ppKn9Aaa	well you did warn her that she should stop this. Even though it's "in" there are less dirty ways of dancing. i am a seventh grader too and my friend dances like that. i try to stay away from it. But you can still look cool without dancing like that. So if you hear, "but if i don't ill be a loser!!" she's not telling the truth. A lot of people in my grade don't do that at our dances. i would tell her that you can go to her best friend's bat mitzfah, but if you see or hear that she was dancing like that, take away cell phone, all privileges, no parties for a few weeks, etc.
SEzIkGNiaa	I answer it every single time.  Sometimes its the parents or an important phone call.  You never know.  Just remember to tell the parents who have called and tell them the message they left =]  If someone is creeping you out, call the parents for advice!<br>  <br>  I usually just say:<br>  <br>  Hello, Destinee speaking.<br>  <br>  I am afraid the ______ are unavailable right now.  Could I take a message?|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I wouldn't answer it. Let the people leave a message, if it's them calling, then you will know. You should know who Grandma is, otherwise there is no need to answer. No one needs to know that you are there alone with the kids and if you answer, hello this is Susie, the smiths can't come to the phone then people will know.<br>  <br>  Ask the Smiths how they want you handle this situation.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	answer the phone professionally and take a concise message.  discuss any other specifics with the parents.|`|AA11570752	yup think you should answer the phone but who would not have caller Id??<br>  that's the strange part|`|AA10976444	Yes...answer it...but don't tell them you are home alone.  Just say that the parent is unavailable at the moment.,|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Yes, just take a message.|`|IIKwBSrxaa	Say, "____ residence," and fill in the blank with your clients' last name.  If they ask for someone that isn't there, or someone that is there and isn't allowed on the phone, say that they can't come to the phone right now and that you will take a message.  If they insist on talking to the person, never tell them they aren't there.  Never let them know you're there alone with children.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	If the parent's have a cell phone, you should not worry about answering their home phone. If there was something wrong, people could get ahold of them that way. I always answered to phone when I was babysitting and wrote down all the messages on a piece of paper. Next time you babysit, ask the parents if they would like for you to answer the phone or not.|`|iEsICA3Maa	Yes. Parents won't like it if they have two thousand messages. Answer it, say it's the babysitter, and when the parents will be home, and take a message. Write it all down on a piece of paper, and tell the parents exactly who it was and what they wanted.|`|8d32360b2ae46f54d5979a019fc43955aa	Yeh yeh, answering it is fine, its not rude but if you are worried about the safety aspect then...<br>  why not ring the grandma and ask if she called, that way you'll know. Or just do a 1471 and see if the numbers match up x.|`|ZWt50qkeaa	next time you babysit ask the parents f it's ok to answer the phone before they leave. just so that confusion don't ovvur again & answer the pphone if you'd ike. i'm sure the parents won't mind|`|7Fc22teCaa	Yup.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	Yes I would answer it, it may be important.|`|O7Hzsq8baa	Yes answer it!|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	answer the phone unless you were told specifically NOT to answer the phone by the parent(s).<br>  <br>  Answer the phone by saying:<br>  <br>  _________'s home. (Your name) speaking.  <br>  <br>  So if you were babysitting Betty Smith and your name is Alice:<br>  <br>  Smith's home.   Alice speaking.  <br>  <br>  Take a good written message stating the time of call and the person calling and their phone number.    be sure to give it to the parent(s) when they return.|`|mr2QE7H1aa	answer it and take a message, then tell the parents that the person called.<br>  make sure to take a name and number, and jot down the time they called.<br>  if its the grandma then it all should be fine.<br>  <br>  if you feel anxious about it, just tells the parents when they get back that the girl was getting worried and that it wouldn't stop ringing!<br>  <br>  have a good evening|`|7sIGQIbxaa	no it would be proper, but if you can call the parents on your cell phone or if the caller  stops calling call the parent and ask what would they like you to do.. never let the child run the show.. you have to do what you think is best. when in doubt let the machine pick it up. I wish you luck...|`|qqgXDogYaa	yeah just answer it. Sometimes you just have to listen to the kids. obviously she used to being in contact with the grandmother and if you don't answer and the parents told the grandmother someone would be babysitting she could be just checking up....so if she would to call again answer.|`|igCopEhOaa	yea i always answered the phone when i babysat.  if the parents dont want you to answer it.. they would have told you!<br>  just take a message or tell the person that they aren't available at the moment.|`|Vc6eNci9aa	Well, I don't have a caller ID on my phone either, so when I have a babysitter for my younger children I tell them to tell the babysitter who it is if they know the number.|`|rscHoVntaa	For the moment, you should answer it. But for next time, ask whether they'd like you to answer the phone. It really depends on the parents.|`|cyt7oh97aa	I'd answer the phone as "[the last name of the family] residence." and take a message and write it down so the parents can call them back later.|`|QkC7DsFKaa	i answer the fone as" Hi this is th Smith  residents" and i say "no they cant com to the fone rite now can i take a message?"|`|ee9AoGPMaa	Ya answer it they cant get through the phone get you.|`|jYk8QS3baa	yes it could be the parents or the grandma answer it|`|wzMhhJi9aa	answer it...."Whoever residence..... Your name speaking"|`|LgGeTaBLaa	Yes, answer it..... if they dont answer or its someone wierd then hang up / call police.|`|FmWx4Osuaa	suree|`|5LMm9AWZaa	i would answer it and if its someone your not shure explain you are babysittin and ask them to call back the next day
FqrKjtzwaa	Viscosity is a property of any liquid that measures how thick it is. Liquids with higher viscosity don't flow as well. For instance, honey has much higher viscosity than water. So if semen has high viscosity, it might have trouble flowing to where it needs to get to before it can fertilize an egg.|`|yp9rEMSraa	Semen Viscosity <br>  Semen viscosity (liquid flow) also affects your fertility potential. If your coagulated semen does not liquefy within an hour of ejaculation, your sperm may be trapped in the cottage cheese-like jelly. I remember one man whose semen did not liquefy. Since the prostate gland secretes the chemical required for liquifaction, I did a rectal examination to check his gland. He just about jumped off the table when I pressed on the swollen tissue. Fortunately his infected prostate responded to antibiotic therapy. <br>  <br>  The most common way of dealing with persistent coagulation or high viscosity is collecting your sperm through masturbation, washing the semen from them, and using your sperm for artificial insemination (AIH). I'll discuss these procedures in more detail.<br>  <br>  <br>  Q. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for a year and a half. I have been on Clomid for eight months now with no results. Each month that goes by seems harder physically and emotionally. My husband's semen analysis was fine except for a thick viscosity. My GYN recommended he take a dose of cough syrup each day to thin it out. He has been doing that for two to three months now. Is this the best course of action? Is there something else we should be doing? We plan to start more aggressive treatment such as laparoscopy and in vitro in June.<br>  <br>  <br>  A: As in every comprehensive fertility work up, evaluation of a possible male factor begins with a semen analysis. Some men, for example, may have asymptomatic infection of the prostate gland that is discovered through a persistent abnormality of the semen analysis. The American Urological Association and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommend a thorough evaluation of the male partner in cases of persistently abnormal semen analyses.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Copyright ? 2002.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  All content here, including advice from doctors and other health professionals, should be considered as opinion only.

EXhVHMAlaa	I got two periods on birth control before I found out I was pregnant.<br>  So, yes, it's possible.  Probably not very likely though.|`|vlbCNihAaa	if your pregnant you shouldnt take the pills. it could harm your un-born child|`|X9Tnpchfaa	you should stop taking the pills if you are pregnant!|`|HPRlEWu1aa	u shouldnt be takin bC if ure pregnant
B7nqTcttaa	Well everyone is different and I knew a girl that got negative results for the first three months and she turned out to be very pregnant! Go to the doctors and get a blood test, they are more accurate. i hope you get your wish!  :)|`|lAQskxoLaa	It depends on when you ovulated to know if it is to soon to test. But if you are seven days late than more than likely you are pregnant good luck!|`|NWv9hOFYaa	Go get a blood test. I think you are pregnant. 7 days left with regular period!|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	You are more than likely pregnant since you are 7 days late. <br>  <br>  you probably just don't have enough hcg in your system yet. <br>  <br>  wish you the best of luck and baby dust to you !
yp9rEMSraa	I would take HPT test at home first....it is the weekend so it is going to be atleast till monday before you can get a blood test...you still have a while before you can find out though...the blood test might not be accurate because it is still so early....i would still wait instead of wasting your money...best of luck|`|ITfBQzg6aa	yes take the HPT first
MzWM9rBRaa	that's a question you should ask your doctor... I think acai ultra burn has some other supplements in it to suppress appetite / provide energy, so it's not 100% harmless.|`|fwro8soqaa	Isn't that to lose weight? If you're pregnant, it's probably best to wait to start that until after delivery. It's pretty much a lost cause until then. You're going to gain even more weight.
wWkfASTNaa	I would wait a few more days and test again, those symptoms sound alot like mine and I am PG, except sex is a lot more enjoyable during pregnancy for a lot of people from what i have heard LOL If you are two weeks late, go to a doctor and see what they can do to either jump start your period or do a blood test. GL!|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	you could be pregnant, but the hormone is low so the HPT doesn't pick it up, although after 2 weeks it should be high enough...<br>  <br>  i always do blood tests, i prefer them to the HPT it's more sure... <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! baby dust!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	When did you take the test?  Did you use your first morning urine?|`|un0gZ7Ybaa	Go see a doctor.
iEsICA3Maa	At about 18 to 20 months they'll be able to feed themselves all their own. My 10 month old cousin can somewhat feed herself, but she usually gets it all over her hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, nose, chin, EVERYWHERE.|`|YBzbtYACaa	put it in front of him and let him have at it so what if he makes a mess, thats what babies do. try him out on noodles, or mashed potatoes. once he get that taste in his mouth he will eat it....|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I would give him about 6 more months or so. By the time kids are 18 months or so they are done exploring thier food with thier hands.
N8oaGQPBaa	no way!!! its fine!<br>  he sounds like a hottie<br>  !! :]|`|BySnX7Gvaa	No,its not weird I mean you can't help who you like I like a 16 year old|`|ejelObdJaa	nahh its not wrong =)<br>  get to kno him so he feels more confortable to tell u if he likes u; in case he does :)|`|FiUprYsvaa	You can have crushes on who ever you want.<br>  Acting on those crushes is another thing. <br>  <br>  And I think you just want to think he is catching glimpses of you...don't worry we have all been there.|`|sj902Wyuaa	NOT AT ALL!<br>  <br>  is it okay for a 21 year old to date a 25 year old?  Yeah it is.  So what's the difference?|`|D6asmqFVaa	no of course not! especially if hes as hot as you say...but i wouldn't get my hopes up.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	u cant help who you fall for.<br>  so no its not wrong at all|`|AA12073774	It is perfectly natural for a girl to be interested in a guy and vice versa. however at this age I think the two of you need to stick to your own age groups when it comes to dating only because your minds are at different places, meaning he is older and more mature than you are. Stick to boys your own age!|`|clFTA9fDaa	natural for you, not really for him. I mean, if he looked like at you like a little sister or just found you hot then that's like average. But actually romantically liking you is kinda creepy. Probably not what you wanna hear, but just my opinion. I mean, why can't he find a girl his age?<br>  And chances are he DOES have a girl. Just be careful what you do|`|i4DhPvjFaa	No. Its not wrong to like him. Attraction is based on many different things age not being one of them. You should do what you feel you want to not what society sees as right.

Saturday?<br>  I will not miss that extra hour of sleep- I'll sleep in. lol<br>  <br>  You can't though, because you're kids are too young, darn it!<br>  <br>  I forgot completely until you just mentioned it. It will take me months to get the hang of it.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I remembered this morning, but I had forgotten again until you mentioned it.<br>  yes, it is tonight.   i hate losing that hour;-(<br>  <br>  Des, you're so wicked (wish i'd have thought of that!)|`|1s3nddaYaa	dont we move it up at 2 tonight right?or b4 we go to sleep move the clock up. or do we do it 2moro? and nope if my mother didnt tell me i wouldnt even know about it lol|`|TQW5E6olaa	:) I had no idea, until I heard it on the radio this AM. It's 2AM Sunday morning, or before you go to bed. All my clocks are digital so they set themselves, I just have to remember to do my car

LOL ^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  Good luck with everything!<br>  Autumn......<3|`|dK6YGyNyaa	I like Ariana, it's unusual but pretty, and Gabriella reminds me of High School Musical.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Gabriella|`|0uhRgfcsaa	ariana|`|KyhnSRrJaa	Gabriella, but I don't like either name really...<br>  <br>  Especially because Ariana sounds like an airhead, cheerleader type<br>  <br>  and people always shorten Gabriella to Gabby.  If you like Gabriella, I would shorten it to Ella right from the beginning because with such a long name, people are going to shorten it, and Ella is a lot nicer than Gabby!|`|gccQIes5aa	i think they are borth pretty :)<br>  but i would have to say Gabriella;<br>  its beautiful &&<br>  i love the nicknames you can have with it<br>  like Gabby, Bri, Ella or even Bella :D|`|8eCyY7RCaa	Ariana definitely!<br>  <br>  I don't like Gab, Gabby.<br>  <br>  I like Ariana.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Gabriella.|`|bcoaoKZQaa	Gabriella|`|fg0N1zRAaa	Ariana|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	Gabriella|`|N5EhfDX2aa	There both as disgusting as each other.

May I ask what you need the names for? or do you just want to know?|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I love them both. I think Ariana is a little better.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I actually like them about the same, but I'll say Gabriella because Ariana might look too much like "Aryan".

qPbKJeXzaa	Parents do feel bad about the little things (and worse of course for the bigger things.)  We would all like to be perfect parents, but unfortunately our human failings will stand in the way.  That is normal.  We can only do our best and learn from our mistakes.  I know you will put sun block on your son's skin next time.  Ultimately we can't protect our children from everything life throws at them.  We can just teach them to be resourceful and resilient.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	No not rally. I feel like dieing when my boys get sick but if the trip I dont really get bothered. They are fine and are just looking for a reaction from you and then they react. I mean if they are really hurt then I feel bad for them. But I do not sweat the small stuff But hey im experienced and I know that **** happens and you can sweat the small stuff.<br>  Tyffannie mother of two boys 2 and 15 months|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Hey don't worry. My daughter tripped in the sand today, got up laughing, and I still felt like I wanted to wrap her in cotton wool|`|F0kjf1j8aa	yes, I still feel bad about thing that happened along time ago, sometimes you get over it and sometimes you don't, its normal  because it comes from love|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Yes, especially if it means I have let someone down, or unintentionally hurt someone...|`|rBq189W1aa	Nah. Sh*t happens. I'd just shrug my shoulders, move on, and try not to let it happen again.|`|J6DmEUTeaa	Yes i do..My daughter is 17mnths and i feel that as her main carer im there to look after her and be there for her every step of the way.Yes of course lil things happen like trips, falls, sunburn, grazes etc but il always get a feelin where i think i wish id done this or that.<br>  They will alway bother me shes my princess but nothing can be perfect.,|`|nqLGVMicaa	Yes, I do, too. My little daughter (14mths) is very lively and she falls a lot and hits her head a lot. I always want to take her in my arms, even when she doesn't even cry. I guess it hurts me more than her.|`|tqmcRE8taa	dont worry about sunburns unless they are really bad. i ABSOLUTLY hate wearing sunscreen and i dont care if i get burnt
gx4s68s8aa	I think 38 weeks is the earliest they will book you for a c-section, unless you have another medical reason that makes it important for you to deliver early for the sake of you health and/or the health of you baby.  Maybe 37 weeks.  Because 37 weeks is considered full term.  But I really doubt they will do it at 36 weeks.<br>  <br>  I say this because I was scheduled for an induction at 38 weeks with my first child.  I had a DVT (Deep vein thrombosis) at 26 weeks into the pregnancy.  And it was important that they knew exactly when I was going to deliver my baby, since I a limited about of time to go off my blood thinners.  I had three doctors and one wanted my to be induced at 36 weeks.  But the other two thought that was crazy and way to early even with my condition.  So the other two doctors decided 38 weeks would be safe for both my baby and me.  I ended up needing a c-section as the induction didn't work.<br>  <br>  So most of the time doctors like 38 weeks best.  It is generally very safe for you and your baby unless there is another medical situation.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your doctor doesn't want you to give birth before 38 weeks there is  a reason for that. It's not safe for the baby. If your doctor feels the baby needs to come otu sooner then he'll get you in sooner. It's better for the baby to stay in as long as possible. Hang in there.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Ask your doctor, they will most likely set it all up for you.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	You are certainly allowed to ask, but if your doctor is any sort of decent doctor, they will make you wait until you are closer to due.<br>  <br>  Sorry to sound heartless, I'm not intentionally trying, but the babies health is a little more important than 3rd trimester pains and niggles.<br>  <br>  It seems strange your OB has told you that it will end in an Emergency c-section, I do not think that is right at all, and it seems stupid that someone would assume such a silly thing.<br>  <br>  I know of 2 women who gave birth vaginally, both with pins in there spines and hips, as a result of a car accident, and as far as I know, they gave birth vaginally without any drama, it seems strange your OB is pressing a c-section, when there is no concrete evidence it is needed.<br>  <br>  So, in closing, a c-section is NEVER 100% safe, and the earlier you get it done, the more dangerous it is.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Sounds to me like you don't want to put the weight on in that last month rather than being concerned about size of baby. <br>  A c-section is a MAJOR operation. Have you realised that? Women have been pushing babies out for thousands and thousands of years - women of all different shapes and sizes. I don't accept your excuse that it's because you're "petite". So what. My mum was a wee dot (5'1 and less than 90lbs) and managed to push 3 of us out. I do accept that rods and pins in your spine will probably make it impossible to push. But if your doctor says you'll be OK up to 38 weeks then leave it up to him. The longer baby is in there the better for baby. Lungs will be more developed and it will be less likely to need intervention to help it breathe, why would you want to jeopardise that for the sake of a few extra weeks and pounds?<br>  A baby is considered full-term from 37 weeks onwards, not 35 weeks or even 36 weeks. Keep it in there for as long as possible.
8zdPI8Qsaa	Though it's more common for the bottom ones to come in first... I've known two children who's top came in first (one actually had 3 of the top incisors before any of the bottom ones). I wouldn't think there's anything abnormal about it at all. <br>  & I'd write down the first date that you actually felt the tooth poke through. Caleb's bottom two came in on the same date, and though I felt something sharp, they weren't really noticeable til about two weeks later. <br>  Congrats on your toofer Hallie!!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My son's teeth came in top then bottom.  The top front 4 then the bottom front four, then the top canines, then the bottom.<br>  <br>  Averages are just that -averages.<br>  <br>  Its up to you what you count for the baby book|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	i know some people whos children cut the top first, every baby is different, my daughter only has two bottom teeth at the front but already has 5 molars! it looks funny, but its nothing to worry about, <br>  i wrote her first tooth in her scrapbook as soon as i could feel it and see a little bit|`|QnYYXRkBaa	yes, it's perfectly normal. it all just depends on the child's gums. but as long as all of the teeth come in eventuall you're fine!<br>  and i'd wait until the full bottom of the tooth is visible.|`|z6qYebkvaa	my cousins teath did that its fine
b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It is hard to diagnose a child based on what you are telling us here. Her behavior may be completely normal or she may have some developmental delays.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned, I would talk to your pediatrician about a referral to a child psychologist. Her language does sound a bit delayed. She may need speech/language services. You may also need some help in parenting her.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Three year olds are challenging.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	She needs to be evaluated with your pediatrician. <br>  She should be talking in sentences. She should be able to feed herself and if she runs off at stores, she needs to be restrained.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Our neighbor's daughter used to bite my daughter. She was considered ADHD, as far as I know, but grew up normally. A lot of children have difficulty learning when they have sensitivities to some foods. Try removing dairy and wheat, and sugar for a few days.
Ka52nbhNaa	Most doctors do NOT prescribe medications to dry up your milk anymore.<br>  <br>  When I switched to formula for my twins, my doctor told me to wear a sports bra - something tight (but not too tight), very supportive.  Wear it all the time, even night.  You can ice your breasts and do NOT do anything to stimulate them.  Don't touch them, when you shower, keep your back to the water . . . It will be really sore, even painful for a few days, then it will be less sore . . . in about a week or so the milk will dry up for the most part but be careful not to stimulate your breasts for another month as you will still occassionally leak a drop here and there and you do not want to bring it back.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes to you!|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	The doctor can give you some kind of medicine to dry it up.|`|rmnvkIBXaa	you just have to wait it out. do not pump or try to feed the baby. your breasts will still produce but if nobody is using it it slowly stops. and it takes about a week. they will hurt too because they will get engorged, but it will pass.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	Honestly I agree with the other moms abt wearing a sports bra or at least a very supportive one. But with that you should put cabbage leaves in each cup. I am serious. You can search and learn abt it on the internet if you don't believe me. I was shocked when I heard about it as well.|`|QT65b1vmaa	there is a shot you can take to stop mammary production, but you might want to check and make sure if u can do that with you current medications...|`|GsSRY7quaa	your doctor can give you a shot to stop the milk production completely.|`|DhUqibKDaa	It will just take a little bit of time. Take ace bandage wrap (the stuff you use if you sprain your ankle) and wrap your chest tightly. You will seep and be a little sore for a while, but your milk production will eventually decrease.|`|z6qYebkvaa	it will dry up or you can pump it and throw it away
rmnvkIBXaa	well if they wanted the child to be a full vamp, one would have to bite it.  a half vamp with magic and vamp triaits would still be very cool, with out all of the worrying about a blood supply.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Going off of mythology, magical ability is usually inherited. Sometimes it skips a generation, and you can write that it does, but it makes sense that the child of a magically inclined person would inherit the innate talent for magic. <br>  (Keep in mind as well, that REAL magic needs to be taught, so you'll have to either have the child's witch parent teach her or another character.)<br>  <br>  Also going off of mythology, vampires can't have babies anyway. But if you saw the recent movie Underworld: rise of the lycans, they break that rule. The child might not need blood to survive but they would some traits of the undead at least. <br>  <br>  In all it would sound like a pretty f-ed up pairing and it probably won't make much sense in the end. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, wrong forum.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Stop watching Twilight little girl.|`|TJusfEnlaa	back to rehab u go - u still have serious issues..|`|RtxKqeMFaa	You'll get this mutated...thing. Probrably a mix, though. Or, there's a possibility that something completely different will emerge. But because of the different between the two, you might not get results...|`|z6qYebkvaa	umm.?.?.? thats odd i dont know how to answer that except wow i guess they would be freaky but its only a myth bout witchs and vampires i think|`|68c6B8dRaa	You know those walking mummies? Yeah, those. There's no such thing as a half-vampire or half-witch; you get something else entirely. Walking mummies!|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Vampires and witches aren't real.  People that think they're vampires and witches would have normal looking kids because they're not really vampires or witches, they're human.
o7bYWjy7aa	it sounds like she has dropped so her head is in your pelvis applying alot of pressure that's how it felt for me i needed to go toilet alot more just constant discomfort was waddling just because she is head down doesn't mean much but she is probably starting to engage or drop your dr can feel for you at your next appointment good luck|`|dW9C6aswaa	Sounds like she is applying pressure to your cervix and the stabbing shooting pains may be a sign of Dilation|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You need to call your doctor. He or she will know more/ better on what you should do or if it's something that needs to get checked out.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Thats baby pushing down and pinching a nerve. I have it too, and it makes me have to stop and take a breath. But its not abnormal. Just let your doctor know at your next appt so she is aware.
ejelObdJaa	nahh... sometimes it means that they just like it.. i love single by neyo and it doesnt mean that if i have a boyfriend & he doesnt come with me to the club im gonna cheat on him hehe :)|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Some people listen to music because it reflects how they feel about something, some just like certain songs for the beat or the way they sound, so it doesn't have to mean that he's a bad boy maybe he just likes the song.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Um, ew.<br>  I don't know I listen to songs about drugs sometimes because I like them, not because I'm on drugs or anything.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	No =S he could just like the song. <br>  <br>  i like katy perrys - i kissed a girl song [well i did before] that doesnt make me a lesbian. afterall its a song isnt it.|`|NYJgiVxraa	im sure he just likes the song. it depdns the person tho. on sum people yes it does reflect their emotinos at the time but im sure hes a fine guy. lil waynes pretty popular for his musci too.|`|FVPOxaeJaa	He could be|`|zNSDHpV6aa	wow i did not like that song . you need to think about him

NVxGp317aa	Hi hun I understand where you are comming from. My husband and I also had 2 miscarriages and the thought of going through the pain of loseing another baby almost kept us from trying again,byt then I realized the pain of not haveing a child hurt even more. We deecided to try once more and I am happy we did. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby girl. Don't get me wrong every little cramp back ache weird feeling I worry that somethings wrong but I am trying to just enjoy being pregnant.<br>  I think for us the big key was finding a doctor that listened to me fears concerns and someone who didn't wait for something to go wrong but was ver proactive. I started spotting at about 5 weeks and right away my progesterone was checked it was a little low so I was put on supposotories. We did ultrasounds more regular to not only check on baby development but to keep me from worrying kind of puts me at ease to see my baby.<br>  Its tough and a battle at time but trying to stay calm and try not to worry really helps.<br>  I wish you luck its a rough decision..but yes it is possiable.|`|eOnEKYhKaa	i had a mc last june at around 8 weeks and i am currently 13.5 weeks with my second. every cramp every little weird feeling scares me to death. i bought a dopplar offline that will be here monday so hopefully i will be able to hear my babys heartbeat every night and sleep eisier i tried the one from bru and i didnt work at all i heard my dogs outside and not even my own heartbeat. all i do is pray every night before i go to bed that my baby is ok. i dont go back to the dr till the 31st and i wish i didnt have to wait that long! its killing me! good luck|`|eemmWU0Haa	Ive had 7 miscarriages..I'm finally getting testing done to see what the cause of all this bullsh!t is, I think I have anti body's who attack my baby and then make me miscarriage sh!tty I know but that's life...hope the test show something so I can get help fast
jY28SNtcaa	Why should you have too? You are the parent- think about that! Don't baby your kids. It DOES NOT HELP THEM IN LIFE. Tell the Truth.|`|qE6BlyCFaa	umm u shouldnt need to...tell em its for grown ups and leave it at that...they are way too young to understand anyways..|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I wouldnt tell him the truth it is for grownups and he should be fine with that response.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You don't. You tell them it's a silly product for adults and that you'll explain it to him when he's a little older.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I don't know why a 5 year old is watching a channel that has Extenze commercials on it.<br>  <br>  Explain the concept of "snake oil" products and that Extenze is just another silly medicine for grownups that doesn't actually work.|`|0ky4TktEaa	You don't explain that at all. What would be the point? It's not like he'd understand. So just tell him its a medicine for grown ups to use and leave it at that. Medicine is such a general term, he should lose interest in it. As much as you can, limit his exposure to that sort of stuff.|`|NI8D46J0aa	You don't. If they ask what it is, you say it's something for grown ups.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I don't even know what that is.
pzLDXL6gaa	I doubt it but you don't know when you would ovulate so it's not worth taking a risk if that's what you're asking. Remember sperm can live a few days and if you ovulate after (not to mention during) the bleeding you could get pregnant<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|kaqPSgTVaa	......Not unless you ovulate.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	If you needed the Plan B pill you probably shouldn't be having sex so soon if you are worried. I'm sick of girls f*****g up and getting abortions or plan b and going right out and getting f****d. If you aren't responsible enough to prevent it to begin with DON'T HAVE SEX.
