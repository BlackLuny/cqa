20090307160732AAIWB7n	Pets;Dogs	I need help with my dog!?	Hello all,      I've asked this question about an hour ago and am asking it again to see if I can get more answers.         I've got a six month old puppy, Roxy, who is quite a good dog - behaviour-wise. She let's me know when she wants to go pee, sits, lays down, stays, comes, catches treats and walks right beside me on command when we go for a walk.      She chews a bit and can't be fully trusted in the house on her own but I've accepted that and know that she'll grow out of it.      My sister-in-law adopted a dog from the same litter about two weeks before I adopted Roxy. Lately, she had taken to chasing local sheep & my sister-in-law was forced to give her away (otherwise she would've been shot by the farmer).      So yesterday, I drove up & collected her to stay with me. And that is where the trouble starts.      She is a very submissive dog, but very frantic at the same time. It's quite hard to explain. For example, when I call her there is a 75% chance that she won't come. When she does come, she basically crawls towards me without looking at me.      When I'm with her, inside & without Roxy, she sneaks around and seeks shelter underneath the rocking-chair or table. Only when I jump around and excite her a little (by being goofy or whatever), does she become somewhat normal. She comes when I call her and just isn't so jittery or submissive.      But as soon as you request that she sit down etc, she gets into this abnormal state again. As soon as my voice becomes authoritative she seems ridden with fear, pees on the spot & even bites. At which point I turn her onto her back and hold her there to let her know that biting is an absolute no-no.      She is also such a bad influence on Roxy. Roxy has started to be much less obedient than usual. Like, when they're both running around outside it is impossible to get any of them to come back inside whereas Roxy on her own, as I said, is a role-model dog when it comes to obedience.      I just went down to the shop which took me about half an hour and left both dogs in the porch (where Roxy always sleeps at night & stays when no-one's home).      I left them toys, something to lie on and a bowl of water but when I came back, it seemed like a bomb had gone off: Everything was flooded (water-bowl), there was piss and poo everywhere (even the dogs where covered in it), the stench nearly made me puke - it was terrible.      I don't know what to do!! Seeing as Roxy was a fairly balanced dog, I thought that Sophie (the other one) would sort of copy her behaviours. But no! Not yet anyways.      Sophie has mostly been kept outdoors at my sister-in-law's with no real structure. Plenty of kids and no pack-leader really. I think that Roxy is the more dominant of the two, she's much bigger too! Strange, seeing as they're the same age.      I can't keep them together as they'll wreck my head - they're wrestling constantly without break with no care as to what they may knock over.      I don't want to have Sophie stay outside as she claims outside as her territory then and will be without supervision most of the time. On the other hand, whilst Roxy is capable of staying outside on her own for long periods of time without causing any harm (ie running away or any of the psychological factors), I feel like she might get jealous or feel like she is being punished if she was to be outside lots.      Plus, I don't really want "outside dogs". I'm lost and really don't know what to do.      Sorry about the lengthy "question" and if anything is unclear I'll add info - just say so.      Thanks.      Additional info:      She was behaving fairly similarly at my sister-in-law's. No idea why but she definitely didn't get as much attention there as Roxy got here with me. Reason: Two toddlers, so she was allowed in the house.      These are a labrador, irish sheepdog mix.      Biting: She doesn't actually manage to bite me, I'm too quick to grab the side of her neck so she physically can't reach. It is fear-biting, I agree. However, once I turn her over to show her that I'm the boss and am not going to hurt her (as she is in a very vulnerable situation on her back), she is reasonably normal when I let her up!
20090307160857AAYSvO0	Pets;Fish	Are these fish compatabile....?	Ok it is a 55 gallon tank.   I know that these fish are not from the same region but   will they go together and are their needs similar?   I have researched quite a bit actually and think they can be ok but   just making sure,      For sure i would like:   Neon Tetras & Glowlight Tetras..... about 20 total   Kuhli Loaches .......maybe three (any suggestions?)   Hatchetts .........maybe 5-6   Glass Catfish ...........maybe 5 (any suggestions?)   African Dwarf frog  ...........prob. one or two         I am thinking about getting   Elephant Fish- i know i would get only one   but i dont know if i have room      pleco(s) or some other algae eater(s) or loach(es)   suggestions?      shrimp (will they be eaten?)      I am trying to balance them out in regions.    If there is more room, feel free to give more ideas.

20090505175637AAeJKDh	Pets;Birds	Where do I get a collar for my lovebird?	I need to buy a collar for my lovebird who plucks his feathers. I've been to the vet & had him tested. There is nothing wrong with him besides this habit (like biting your nails). The collars that most vets have are over-sized, like the ones for dogs. They look like a big cone & they can't move or fly properly. I'm looking for one that resembles a cloth covered neck brace and & slips over the head to prevent him from bending his neck around to pull the feathers. Any ideas?? I'd rather not make it myself, I've seen instructions online.       THANK YOU! :)

20090307140226AAfa3WQ	Pets;Other - Pets	What your think about the chimpanzee that rip the woman face in Cleveland?	I think that woman is very stupid and nuts if a animal have sharp teeth for eating wild animals that they kill that sharp teeth is capable of tearing a human up in pieces and that want the chimpanzee have. That woman may not have a pretty face and may be blind forever I think she lost a arm and legs do and her memories may take a long time to come back the chimpanzee attack her because it doesn't recognize her because she changed her hairstyle and driving a different car she try to get the monkey off her but she can't completely getting off her and she beg the cops to shoot it and the cops did because it was charging at them and it rip off the mirror of a cop car. I think they should press charges and make it a law that it s illegal to keep any wild animals as pet in that state. She kept that monkey a long time.

This is probably a long shot but, I found a dog groomers in Canon City in the yellow pages, however I haven't heard anything about them. I can't find any rating on the internet, and everyone I've talked to doesn't know if they are any good either. (I don't live in the same town) I'm sure they have to be doing something right otherwise they wouldn't still be in business, but I'd like to hear something about them. Do a little research if possible. I don't want to take my dogs to just anyone and they didn't like the last groomer, So i'm really trying to find someone good. We have gone to petco, but it's just so far away. Does anyone know some website I can go to that might have info on specific groomers or does anyone know themselves about them. They are called Happy Tails I would love any info you got Thanks

So there's this drop-dead gorgeous mare that I want to buy, and the owner is willing to cut her cost down to $5000 to meet my budget. Yay. But now here's the hard part. With some help from my wonderful (I'm not being sarcastic, she's great) riding instructor, I have constructed a list of all possible costs for a year and down to a per month cost. It will cost me anywhere from $510 to $871 a month to keep her, and this does not include the cost of the horse or the cost of the tack. I really want a horse, I have since I was in third grade, and I am now in tenth.   I make about $200 a month at my job. How can I make the money to support a horse while still keeping my grades up and have enough left over to put in my account to save for college?   Thanks!

20090227084037AAmCS8X	Pets;Fish	My betta fish is not getting better! Please, please help?	I have been treating my betta for 10 days with Hikari's "Betta Revive". This is what the petstore gave me for his fungal infection. I had noticed what appeared at first to be air bubbles on his skin, but upon further inspection they looked a little fuzzy. I am keeping his water pristinely clean and do a water change with conditioned water (dechlorinated) EVERY morning. Still compared to my other betta his water looks a little cloudy with some stringy junk in it...after only 24 hours. Now I put him in a smaller 16 ounce container for easier medicating and water changes. But still it's awfully dirty for only 24 hours. He is eating and behaving normally...but the edges of his fins have clear edges. Is this new fin growth? His fins were pretty frayed..because of finrot...I didn't realize it was fungus and NOT marbling for about a month. I know I should be shot for not running him straight to the store for treatment. But I just want him to get better...Is there another medicine? What do I do? I don't want him to die!

It has happened three times, and all the times my dog has to go to the vet to get stitches. The last time it happened he almost lost his eye.      My neighbor is not going to get her dog fixed because "she wants to breed it." What do I do to protect my animal? I love him to death, but he's so small and helpless, and I don't want to keep him inside all day (he has an electric collar).      Should I put cayyane pepper on some dog treats and give it to the dog next door or something? I'm looking for ways to protect my animal.
20090307160052AAyM6YB	Pets;Dogs	Which breeds of dogs are known to be calm and quiet but still plays with you?	Ok so we got a young maltest (less than a year old) and now we are ending up giving him away because he's hyper and we've gotten complaints from neighbors and the animal shelter, but our mom has greed to get us another pet that we research first and see that their breed is calmer  because we have found out that malteses are just hyper by nature. So if anyone knows of any dog breeds (preferrably small indoor dogs) that are calm and wouldnt have a barking problem but are still playful, i would really appreciate it!      if u have links too that would be nice. tanks so much!

Now he starves himself until he dry heaves/pukes up bile. The only thing he wants is people food, I've tried mixing certain people foods with his dog food that are supposed to be good for him but he either just licks it off or literally picks out every bit of whatever it is I put in there. I have also tried the dog gravy that doesn't work anymore either.

20090227084735AAKnEuo	Pets;Fish	I need a goldfish expert!!?	My original 29 gallon tank broke so i bought a new one with a new filter also, it has been setup now for 3 to 4 weeks, i have 3 orandas in it.  My question is my tank looks perfect but when you open the lid there is a strong ammonia odor, 4 days ago i added 2 long bubble stones before i added the stones there was no odor now it seems like the bubbles that come to the surface have ammonia in them when they pop, does this make any since or is it just a coincidence,  i do not have any test strips my local pet store is out of them and i have no where else to get them.  I was wondering where my tank is still cycling what i should do, and how long does it usually take to cycle.  Please recommend me a check list also of everything i should do with my tank weekly, monthly and etc..  I love my fish and i want the best for them.  Thank You very much !!

And was wondering if some of the users who are familiar with breeds that undergo cropping and docking would be willing to share some of the history and the purpose behind it?      I have an Aussie with a docked tail, and when we were deciding to get one I educated myself on how to look for a breeder who has had the tails done properly, as to those who haven't.      I don't really have an opinion on it either way, I prefer the look of natural ears on dogs, as opposed to cropped, but tails that are done properly and are healthy don't bother me.      So those with experience with these breeds could you offer me some insight of the history and the practice of it now?

20090307120441AAmxS83	Pets;Dogs	How sad is this dog story?	When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and made you laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend. ...      Whenever I was "bad," you'd shake your finger at me and ask "How could you?" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a belly rub.      My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together. I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not be any more perfect.      We went for long walks and runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because "ice cream is bad for dogs" you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.      Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently, comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.      She, now your wife, is not a "dog person" -- still I welcomed her into our home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy.      Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh, how I wanted to love them, but I became a prisoner of love."      As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.      There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories about me. These past few years, you just answered "yes" and changed the subject. I had gone from being "your dog" to "just a dog," and you resented every expenditure on my behalf.      Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've made the right decision for your "family," but there was a time when I was your only family.      I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled out the paperwork and said "I know you will find a good home for her." They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with "papers."      You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar as he screamed, "No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.      You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked "How could you?"      They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago.      At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad dream... or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me.      When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited. I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room. A blissfully quiet room.      She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days.      As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood.      She gently placed a tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran down her cheek. I licked her hand in the same way I used to comfort you so many years ago.      She expertly slid the hypodermic needle into my vein. As I felt the sting and the cool liquid coursing through my body, I lay
20090227084910AAbVQ6Z	Pets;Horses	Basics of reining and would she be a good prospect?	My mare is turning 4 this March and she is greenbroke at this point. This summer I am going to put a lot of miles on her, but I also want to start her in a western dicipline. I am highly considering starting her in Reining, but I am wondering what the basics are as well as if she is a good prospect for it.      Her gaits are amazing, but not good enough for Western Pleasure yet as she is still a bit bumpy in gait changes as well as in her lope. Her trot is smooth and Ive noticed that without my request, she changes from a fast trot to a slow smooth trot. Her lope like I said is a bit bumpy still, but we are working and it is fairly smooth. She knows basic voice commands while riding such as clicking your tounge to trot, and kissing to lope. She is learning leg cues and has basic reining training. She knows that when the rein lays on her neck she goes in that direction etc. I also want to add that she is a gorgeous black and white tobiano paint.       I want to find out the basics of reining so I kind of know what to look for in her and also what ot start training as the basics to see if she would accel in this dicipline. If you have a link or could give me some basic information that would be much appretiated.

My reason is because if he gets a small cut, i dont want the gravel to roughen' him up and introduce finrot, so i thinking just to add a heater, an airpump, a plant, and water.        yup. thats a simple tank al right.  now about the plant, i want a plant that doesnt require any fertilizer or gravel etc.  remember i dont want to keep a tank with gravel or any kind of base covering.  is there a plant that can just stay in the water,  would this one be ok?       http://joshday.com/images/plantedvase.JP...       im sure you've seen it in alot of videos in greater detail      its that plant many betta breeders use for spawning bettas, it looks like a vine of some sort.  if this does require soil or gravel however, PLEASE list a plant that doesnt require.     thanks =)

20090307121235AAUM4kQ	Pets;Dogs	Dog park- My male dogs behavior!?	Hi i have a 7 month old Maltese, named Louie. Louie has not been neutered yet, but has an appointment the 15th.    I've been taking him to the dog park since he was 6 months and he interacts very well with the other dogs- Lately he has no interest in playing, chasing, running- His visits usually consist of finding a MALE dog to play dominance games (it looks like wrestling sometimes but basically they compete to mount each other and then hump one another) with- This is the only thing that interests him-  Sometimes this can be really embarrassing depending on how the people react- Not all people understand this behavior as dominance- And are frustrated with their "gay" dog-     I suppose my question would be, how do i handle this behavior? I take Louie to the park once a day for an hour (or more depending on my schedule), and this problem just keeps getting worse- I will usually intervene if he's bothering another dog, or the dog happens to be female- But I'm not sure what to do when it's a male, and their obviously "playing". This is okay behavior, right? And will probably pass, correct? I feel silly chasing him around the park like some owners and at the first sign of him mounting screaming "NO!!!!!!"   Although some owners FREAK out- And I'm not sure how to handle this? Anyone know what I should do?

The chi survived but needed major surgery and is still not out of the woods.  I have had dogs my whole life and never had any do something like this.  Even with more training can he really be trusted around my little ones.  The attack took off most of her neck and put holes in her side she escaped by sliding through a hole in the fence and managed to get in the house and hide in a closet.  We found her about an hour after.  Where was I at?  I was outside on the other side of the house doing yard work.  She must have not yelled because I did not hear anything.  Should I find him another home without small dogs.  I am not sure I can ever trust him again.  I need good solid suggestions.  We love him and I am so worried that if I find him another home the person might not take care of him and love him like he deserves.

20090307105520AAyQ9mI	Pets;Dogs	Does my Westie Need a Companion?	Okay, heres the thing. We got my young little West Highland Terrier about 7 months ago. We have trained him well and he is very happy. We had him enrolled in a Puppy Training School and he did very well and met all the other small puppies and was always so excited to see them every week and was always so happy. Unfortunately, he is our only dog and now he seems lonely and seems like he is going into a "depression". He isn't as happy and bites us sometimes and he will walk around with his head down and is all lethargic. Should we get another puppy companion for him? I need proof for my dad that we should. Please let me know and give links to the puppy.       Thank you so much

20090307111046AAgcH0x	Pets;Dogs	Dog tries to attack people when I walk him! Help?!?	My mom and I just got a year and a half old chihuahua/terrier mix a week ago. He is such a good dog when he's in the house. If we invite people into our home that he hasn't seen before, he's really friendly with them. However, when we take him outside to go to the bathroom (we live in apartment complex), and strangers are close by, he will bark, growl, and just generally go nuts trying to attack them. How can I stop him from doing this? It really hurts my wrist when he pulls like that, and I'm tired of people giving me looks and telling me I have a vicious dog.

20090227090507AAD81UD	Pets;Dogs	Do you ever wonder if sometimes your dog would have been better as an only dog?  I do and feel bad for that?	Today I am home with just Sasha (my Jack Russell Terrier mix)  Zackie our poodle went with my grandfather for the day (he is going to give him a haircut)      Zackie if full of personality and he also can be really defiant.   Don't get me wrong he is the sweetest dog in the world but he gets my JRT mix going and edges her on.      Zackie is just Zackie (and we have been working on his behaviors since day one....and we are realizing we can't change his personality we love his personality)      Problem is he is a very bad influence on our JRT mix Sasha.   And he can bring about her bad qualities at all the worst times.....And he comes off looking like a Saint and (her being bigger comes off looking really bad)      So far today I've seen how good she is by herself...she is sweet and cuddly and doesn't bark.     She obeys all her commands (she doesn't when Zack is around).   She comes when called she doesn't get into things she isn't supposed to.      Sometimes I think she might have been better off an only dog.    She is the perfect dog for me most of the time and today she is just a perfect angel.         Don't get me wrong I know she loves Zack and I'm sure he loves her.      And I love them both and do not regret getting either of them.      I would never give up either one of them (Zack was our first one and then Sasha.....Zack wasn't too happy when we got Sasha.....Zack was 8 months old when we brought in Sasha)      I feel bad for thinking this way?      I feel bad for thinking my poodle is such a bad influence?      We are still working with Zackie very very hard.  He is going to take obedience with Sashas teacher this spring.   We look forward to doing classes with Zachary.

But, when I looked at how expensive her puppies are (up to $5500) it seemed like maybe she is in it for the money. Also, I noticed that one of her B!tches, Muffin, just had a litter of one puppy on the 24th of this month (Nursery). And Muffin has one or two Chihuahuas already in the Available pages that were born back in October... And she already bred her again?       I thought you were supposed to breed Champion dogs that were meant to better the breed? Only 3 or 4 of her Chihuahuas are Champions (2 male / 2 female I'm pretty sure) and yet she is breeding about 15 females with over 12 different males!      Please check her site out and let me know if I am wrong, and if maybe she is a really good breeder. But as of right now, I think that she may be a Back Yard Breeder (BYB).      Thank you.

They are just the cutest little things! I'm just a little unsure about getting one, seeing how I've never owned a hamster but do have experience with other rodents. I have also heard that they are difficult to catch because they're fast and wiggly when you hold them. The larger hamsters just didn't seem to appeal to me and I have never considered getting a hamster until now. They just seemed so sweet and came over (probably just looking for food). I'm sure there are other hamsters out there that are much better for beginners, but I love this breed! What other breeds should I look into? What are your opinions/experiences with Robo Dwarf hamsters?

The goldfish are just not as active as before and are scraping themselves on the tank.      Before I bought 2fantail goldfishes from the same shop and it had ich, so i asked the shop owner how to treat it and he said put 1 table spoon of aquarium salt per gallon(5litres), so i did so and my fish died from the salt, they were scaleless and their eyes looks burnt and all sorts , it was very discusting and i felt so bad  for them to see them die that way. And i dont want a repetition of that, it is very sadening and upsetting.      A few weeks later i went out and bought from the same petshop another 3 fantail goldfishes. 2weeks later i find they have got ich.       So I then went out and bought aquarium salt but the only problem is, i am not sure how much salt shall i put in the water for GOLDFISH.

20090307122857AAt3jve	Pets;Fish	Help, my neon tetra fish keep dying!?	When I first got my tank a few months ago, I had bought 4 tetra neons. Before I go any further, I realize I should've bought more since they're school fish.   Anyway, three of the four died because there was Ich in the water, causing all of my other fish to die as well except the one tetra neon. I treated the Ich properly, let the tank cycle until I was sure the Ich was gone. Then I got four more neons, and they've been in my tank for about two weeks and three of them have died, the original one still living. Also during the Ich, I had four fantail guppies, which died, but had babies as well. They all survived the Ich. I don't know if they would've affected the fish at all or not. Also in the tank now are an apple snail and a plecostamus that's about 3 1/2 inches, but he tends to stay away from the rest of the fish.      Before the Ich, I had a different plecostamus, the four guppies, and a Dojo Loach. I don't know if they would've affected anything or not. But they all died during the Ich.

They explained her personality saying she is very shy but very sweet. She had slight wild tendancies as she was born in the wild. They were also responsible for fixing and homing her father as well. They said she had the tendancies to make love bites when she was happy, which she did. She made my finger bleed quite nicely but I thought she was so beautiful and knew I'd be saving a life so I took her.      When I took her home she was shy. nothing out of the ordinary. She stayed hidden for a while but gained trust in me and even my small dog. She seemed to love the attention and security though she liked to be a frisky curious kitty.      Well, many months have elapsed, and she still is quite shy with people she doesnt know, but thats not my concern. She is quite confusing bc while she sems to get more comfortable with being affectionate towards me (when affection is shown to her first) she ALSO seems to be acting more and more wild as time passes to the point where this, in conjunction with certain physical characteristics makes me wonder if shes even regular house cat.      I am aware kitties like to attack, and play with their "kill". I also know they have a love/anger towards feet. But i was told at one point that cats are somewhat lazy and have short attention spans and in such generally dont seek "revenge" for something that annoyed them. If they choose to respond to such an annoyance, its right then as apposed to kitty coming back in a minute or a few to come get revenge.      The cat over-does the whole 'stalk the prey thing' in my oppinion. Its one thing to be nocturnal and bite toes and go after stringy somethings and things that move about, but when the cat is spending the whole night attacking you and doggie, and doesnt quit I think thats bordering on an obsession with "killing."      Furthermore, she goes after calves or any other body part if you move at all. I have had the cat run around and throw herself on me and boyfriend, wrapping around the legs to attack. almost every day. I've also had her attack my face -eye balls!!- on numerous occasions bc apparently I blink and that bothers her. She never leaves my poor dog alone. She claws him and hits him and bites him all day all night. He wont be around and shell go find him. He will be asleep and she as well, she will wake up to go torture him repeatedly  and go back to bed. She also corners him in his kennel, or when I put him in there she sits on on top and makes sure that no matter what he is confined in one corner other wise she will scratch. she also is amazingly strong and as crazy as it is to hear, she has been known to throw him up and body slam him down. he is tiny and she is... solid!!      she gets totally angry with objects like papertowl rolls and will knock them down from whereever they are and gets SO mad. she literally will ruin an entire roll in 2 seconds when im not even there to see it. when i am there i can tell you she looks genuinely mad. she gets to them no matter what. She seeks them out. It makes eating or cleaning a task to say the least.      of course, she likes attention. if i walk the dog she whines at the door. when i come home from work she seems so sad and demands to be pet. she even has to follow me into the bathroom. she cant be alone yet everything is on her terms. she will allow affection. but you only can get maybe 3 pets before she attacks.       when i say attack i dont mean the cat biting or scatching, which is bad enough, she goes into "kill mode". this is all she knows to do- shes a bit excessive. she does the whole 'lay on the side grab, strangle, kick with the back paws all with claws hooked into you' thing. you can feel them getting tighter by the second. doesnt feel so great. i dont know how she got so strong but she has a way of making me loose feeling in whatever area she has ahold of.      if you so much as accidently run into her or touch her you will have hell to pay. these are things i touched on in vet appointment but shes UTD on vaccinations and i havent made an appointment just for her behavior issues. I dont think it would come in handy bc im having training issues with dog and my vet doesnt offer the best advice. I think certain things need to be addressed with someone in the behavior field as apposed to HEALTH field. they say shes helathy.. so..      as for correcting these issues, i try not to feed into them at all. Its true i found out first hand that she prefers to be pet aggresively as apposed to lovingly, and likes to be 'roughed up a bit'. Trust me i dont do this regularly. I found out once or t

20090307160227AAcpCDu	Pets;Fish	Is my Betta fish's water too cold?	Because in the early morning, and in the early evening, all through the night when it's a *LITTLE BIT* colder in the house, my Betta fish, Tropica, always sits underneath her heater. :(    There is a TINY LITTLE space under her heater where she can swim into, and sit there, and be warm, I guess. :| The water temperature feels cold, but it says about 20 degrees Celsius. It just borders on the "Safe Zone," for the fish tank.   Is that good, or bad? Do I need to get a DIFFERENT water heater? My tank is about 5 gallons. ;)    Help?! I'm confused. Oh, wait.... one other thing. I have, like, TONS of pellets for Tropica to eat over the next few months. I give her four every morning and she doesn't eat them. :\ Instead, she just leaves them lying about and eats a few pieces of the tropical fish flakes I gave her.... are Betta fishes picky about what they eat?! :( Because BOTH of my friend's Betta fishes eat THEIR pellets; anyone know what's up with mine?!

My teacher had a problem with mice in her kitchen    (home ec)      So I bought a humane mouse trap because she was using the snap ones that kill. I have set it in her kitchen and have caught two mice already and have set them free but I'm not allowed to go very far from the school.       I am afraid they will just get back in the school and die in another teacher's trap.       Should I try to take them home with me on the bus because I have lots of woods and fields around my house and it would be safer in the long run?      I could sneak the mouse no problem on te bus or I could call my grandma to come and get me..      or      Set them free about 20 feet away from the school and risk them getting back in the school.         Help!      And if I did take them home and set them free there how would I keep them from stressing on the ride? Its about 45 minutes on the bus   =/

All from the feral colony and we missed it, have to give her daily worming and antibiotics. VERY unpleasant with a feral.

I have two young NEUTERED male cats (1 year old) who were introduced a few days ago after two weeks apart (one was a rescue kitten who was being medicated). They are both very healthy and very sweet and cuddly. The only thing is that when they start to wrestle it seems to be very rough some times. They haven't seemed to bite each other (hard) but hiss a little back and forth with some meowing. But then they all of the sudden back off and lay down with each other and fall asleep. Is it normal for them to be so rough with one another? I just don't want them to bleed or get hurt. Thank you for your time!

If you move something he will bark where it was. Also he pounces like a cat does and leaps, but mostly pounces. Finally he sticks his tounge out and sleeps with this little piece of his tounge out. he will just run or do what wat ever when it hangs out.

20090307161728AA42sLI	Pets;Dogs	I have a 9 month old spayed female Beagle?	who has recently taken to peeing all over my floors, furniture, clothes, everything, she is also now starting to poop in the house, but then she tries to eat it. I have even caught her trying to eat my other dogs poop outside, so she is not eating her own just because she afraid of getting in trouble. I have had her since 8 weeks of age, she has never been abused and nothing has changed. Why would she start this when she has been house trained? She is destroying everything and we just bought new furniture and mostly new flooring. We have a fenced yard that I let her out into to go to the bathroom. I can leave her out there for 5 minutes or even 30 minutes and as soon as she comes in she pees all over, even after I see her pee outside. I praise her outside when she goes, but its not working. If I see her pee inside I take her right back out. What could be going on? She was just at the vet a month and a half ago (spayed) and got a clean bill of health. I love her dearly and don't believe in getting rid of dogs, but she sure is making things very difficult, my house smells, I'm not sure I'll ever get the smell out of my new furniture. I'm tired of stepping in it. I mean it is awful, this is not one wet spot every day, this is dozens. I was told to reduce her water so she wouldn't drink so much at a time, but she still pees everywhere. Ugh please help! ANY advice would be greatly appreciated. I can't afford to replace everything and as much as she is peeing that is what I am going to have to do, I can't leave her outside all day because she barks ALL the time. I do kennel her when I leave and she does not pee in there.  She is the worst Beagle I have ever had. And I've had many and love the breed very much.

20090307172030AAqk3o8	Pets;Cats	Anybody with a Siamese Cat?	Any of you people out there with a Siamese cat, just wanted to ask you a few questions about them. Do yours throw up, like every other day. Also, do they constantly meow that annoying meow for food. My siamese cat is a Chocolate Point female, indoor cat, 13 years old. She is extremely skinny, 7 pounds, and we have tried to give her all of this food, but she won't get any fatter. She maybe has gained 2 pounds since we had her. She also is still super playful and whenever we are downstairs eating, we hear her little paws running up the halls. Is any of yours really friendly and nice? Mimba, my siamese is astoundingly sweet. Like, nicer than any cat I ever met. I am 13 years old, (my cat is older than me!) yet she comes to me the most. My sisters hate to admit it, my parents don't mind as much, but she is really obsessed with me. Do they cling to one person like that normally? Also, are yours very curious about things? Just wanted to know, because in the 6 years we have had her, I have never known if she acts like all the other Siamese cats or if she is different? Oh, and one more thing, has she lived past her normal life-span of an indoor siamese cat. Do you think she will live longer if she is still very healthy and lively? Thanks!

20090307173538AAbGxQs	Pets;Dogs	Vizsla Owners Gather Around And inform Me!..Please x)?	Well as in my previous post i have found a new love and attraction to the Vizsla breed. I met my first two, a day ago and i am hooked. I have been reading up about them, have been watching videos, talking to the owner of the 2 amazing Vizsla's i met the other day. They seem like a perfect fit for me. So i am looking so forward into getting one in the near future. I would guess in about a couple more years. I have 3 dogs right now. A Chihuahua a Pomeranian and a Chihuahua/poodle mix. Yes there all toy dogs, so a Vizsla may seen odd for me to all of the sudden want but......I have always had big dogs. I foster and volunteer at my local shelter. Its so happened that the dogs i rescued and kept permanently are all toy dogs lol. I love all dogs big and small (Esp. the Chihuahua!! xD). Anyway, how would a Vizsla handle being with toy dogs? Lets say i get one in 2 years my dogs then will be 2,6 and 7 years old. I know they will be fine with the Vizsla puppy..Its the Vizsla i am worried about are they OK with small dogs? So i have a few questions for you LUCKY Vizsla owners-      Is it true that these dogs are cat-like very clean, clean themselves and have almost no odor?      This is preference but when you decided to get your Vizsla why do you chose that gender? is there a preferred gender?      Are they easy house breakers(potty training)?      Are they agility dogs? Could i do agility with this breed?      All my dogs are Velcro dogs, I love that. Its a trait i prefer, Is your Vizsla a Velcro dog?      At what age are they fully grown?      How  big do they typically get?      What should i look for in a Vizsla breeder? (First time buying from a breeder, i have always adopted.)      Thanks everyone!      PS:      Purebred Vizsla owners only please :}      There are 4 other dog breeds that i too want to get in the future, but i weighed everything out to see what would be the best fit out of all of them and the Vizsla was the one. But my goal is to get each breed. x)      For those who ask to go through a rescue, id love too, i have NEVER bought a dog before, i have had MANY many dogs and they were all rescues, I foster and volunteer at my local shelter i also sponsor breed rescues. So i think its fair this time to go through a breeder :P. I am buying because i want to show and do agility and all that stuff with a show quality dog.       Thank you very much. :D   (Sorry once again for the very looonngg question, i tend to do this ALOT!)

I was wondering if she could live with one of those White mice you normally would feed to a snake. I wanted to get one and have them live together. Is it possible, without having them fight?
