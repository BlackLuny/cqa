20090310023904AAb5CxL	Politics & Government;Politics	Is America's problem that the Federal Reserve assumes nothing will ever fail?	A top economist for the Federal Reserve said they "assumed everyone makes good on the contracts". They soon learned that wasn't true.......which makes you wonder what else they're assuming.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/200903...       The risks of these below-the-radar insurance policies became abundantly clear last September with the collapse of investment banker Lehman Brothers and global insurer American International Group , both major swap dealers. Their insolvencies threatened to zero out the value of billions of dollars in contracts held by banks and others.      Until then, "we assumed everyone makes good on the contracts," said Vincent Reinhart , a former top economist for the Federal Reserve Board .

I mean seriously... what does it accomplish? Yahoo! Answers used to be a place for legitimate question asking and discussion and now all it is is a place for bitter people to come and complain and insult other people while hoping to have the people who agree with them make them feel better. It honestly doesn't look like anything is going to change that which unfortunately means that I won't be spending too much more time on here because far too often I find myself arguing with people that aren't even worth my time. If anyone knows of a legitimate political blogging site where it's more intelligent discussion then petty insults and namecalling could you please let me know...

All of this was occurring in huge numbers while he was in office, but all the media focused on was how "well" we were doing in the war or how everything in America was running "as it should be"  Obama inherited a mess of garbage and now all we here are negative statistics about the economy, health coverage, job losses, fewer people attending college, etc....Obama didn't cause all of this mess in the 2 months or so he's been in office.  It was obviously inherited.  Why wasn't any of this mess (even though EVERY American knew it was occurring) brought to light and made important while Bush was in office?

Part of the stimulus plan is to address our infrastructure and educational systems. Both have been failing over the past few years.      FYI...our infrastructure and education system didn't deteriorate starting January 21st (or 2 yrs ago as many like to suggest).      Many Repubs balk at helping these very important issues thus the reason we're where we're at now.      So, why did our previous President behave like Nero when it came to Education & Infrastructure?      thoughts?

The 17-year-old plaintiff, Steven, and several of his friends celebrated the last day of June exams by holding a party. During the party, several students, such as Steven, had quite a few beers. Since it was a hot day, Steve and his friends went to the beach to beat the heat, operated by the defendant city. Steve and his friends sat on the life-guard chair and chatted for a while. There was a sign on the chair, "Beach unsupervised. Swim at own risk." Steve stood feet first and jumped off the chair feet first into the foot deep water (1ft.). He then said he would dive. His friends tried to stop him, but steve climbed back up and dived face first into the shallow water off the chair and remained face-down. Steve was taken to the hospital and as a result of the dive, he became a quadriplegic.      Steve brought an action for damages for personal injuries to the Ontario court of high justice. Evidence that was presented showed steve was physically fit, a good swimmer and could dive.      Why did steve sue the City of Ottawa? Who were all the parties who might have been in position to have prevented these injuries? Did they do what they were supposed to do and do you think their actions were reasonable?

20090309155244AAlCdK2	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What is China trying to prove by harassing US Naval ships?	WASHINGTON – Chinese ships surrounded and harassed a Navy mapping ship in international waters off China, at one point coming within 25 feet of the American boat and strewing debris in its path, the Defense Department said Monday. The Obama administration said it would continue naval operations in the South China Sea, most of which China considers its territory, and protested to China about what it called reckless behavior that endangered lives.   At one point during the incident Sunday the unarmed USNS Impeccable turned fire hoses on an approaching Chinese ship in self defense, the Pentagon said. At another point a Chinese ship played chicken with the Americans, stopping dead in front of the Impeccable as it tried to sail away, forcing the civilian mariners to slam on the brakes.   "We view these as unprofessional maneuvers" and a violation of international law, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said.   The incident had overtones of spycraft, but the U.S. ship is not, strictly speaking, a spy ship. It maps the ocean floor with sonar, compiling information the Navy can use to steer its own submarines or track those of other nations.
20090225084646AAIXcNq	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Question about parental rights?	My sister just had a baby boy this morning, and the guy that she has been dating off and on for the past 2 years, and has been there the whole pregnancy is ready and willing to sign the birth certificate. We know there is a big possibility this baby isn't his, but he doesn't care. He wants to sign the Birth Certificate, and wants 100% responsibility of the baby. My question is once he signs the acknowledgment of paternity, and Certificate does that mean he is the father to this baby. Or if by some chance another guy wants to order a paternity test do they have to agree to it, knowing the birth certificate was already signed, and her boyfriend has take the father figure in the baby's life. And what if something happens to her and the boyfriend. Say they break up. Does my sister have a right to draw child support on the baby through the ex, or will a paternity test be ordered, and another question if something does happen between the 2 of them, and he is on the birth certificate as the father can he fight for custody of this baby? I worry for my little sister, and I don't want her to get herself into a place where she could loose the baby if it came to a custody battle. I want this baby to have a mother and a father, even if that means never knowing who the real father is. I am also concerned that if this guy isn't the father and someone else wants to know if they are or not does that give them rights to a dna test if a signature is already on the birth certificate?

They have been visiting my home in over a year sometimes without any search warrants and during those times I've been cooperative and letting them come in.       On one occasion they broken my door because my 6 year refuse to open the door while I was taking a shower. I have no associations with my kids father and I explain that to the officers on numerous times and one of the officers suggested that I should go  down to the post office to have his name removed from my mailing address. I did so and unfortunately that did not help and the police returned once again. I would like to know what are my rights ? Are they allowed to do these things and make threats to me in front of my children about taking them away. Asking my children if they have seen their dad.       I feel like my rights has been taking away and I'm no longer comfortable in my own home. This has traumatized my children a great deal. I don't know what to do , they said that they will keep coming and if they hear any male voice in my home that they will break down my door. I can't have this going on here , all I'm trying to do is to raise my children. I feel like I'm being put on the spotlight here and how can I convince someone to turn themselves in when I don't speak or see. Need advices please thanks.

20090309142636AAge1mg	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Have you noticed that more & more money/cash mean...?	...precious little, at least compared to "social positioning?  For an example,  Getting your home/real estate paid off, money in the bank, vehicle(s) paid for & generally getting into a debt free position.  In other words, getting into the position where one could pull out of the race of life when so desired & letting those that desired to keep going in the "race" do so.   I've noticed tho that increasing taxes, changing laws & government mandates seem DESIGNED to keep the "common folks" or those that mind their own business,  from "pulling out of the system" & just do their own thing so to speak.   Taxes no longer seem about needed revenue for limited government operation.  It seems that taxes are all about (P)eople (C)ontrol(PC) & little to do with revenue.  I mean with a fiat currency taxes are really not needed as a few minutes of the ole printing presses running they got "instant" revenue anyways, right???   Have the American public at large been unwittingly "duped" into a fascistic form of government, under the guise of "government knows best"?  If this is indeed so, would it not be best regarding an individuals personal liberties to eliminate those that are encroaching unwanted into their personal life?   Eliminating government politicians by replacing them with Constitutionally based REPRESENTATIVES of & for the people would seem the "intelligent" or common sense move regarding personal liberties.  If not, would it be better to convert to a "volunteer" tax system?  A system where those that desired to pay taxes for unconstitutionally based social control programs could, & those that did not want to pay taxes into such programs could just opt out?  Would that not be more in line with our founding fathers vision for the new republic they created.   Of course there will always be those that desire every one else to be just like themselves.  But,  are not those type of people the (P)eople (C)ontrol(PC) advocates themselves that our founding fathers designed our Constitution to protect our personal liberties from????.   One thing people have learned through the ages... technology is always changing,  but people NEVER change.  Todays person is identical in thought, need & body that our ancestors were thousands of years ago.   That's why Americas Constitution was not designed to be a living, or changing document.  Our founding fathers knew that man would remain the same from one millineum to the next.  With this said,  would it be best to go back to Constitutionally based government & a "volunteer tax" system?

I mean okay just from driving tickets alone. Let's see. got my license in late 2000, and already received three speeding tickets between then and 2003,...then got a wrong left turn ticket, and another wrong right turn ticket, then a red light ticket a year later, then parking tickets and parking in a handicapped (which was totally my fault but I only did it for like 1 minute to drop off a piece of mail), then I also got a shoulder riding ticket a few years later,..and two more speeding tickets.      Now....that sounds like I'm the world's most horrible driver, but I SWEAR TO YOU (and I live in the NYC area)      they seem like they're n@zi, and they're out to get you.      Many people drive like maniacs, and I get anxious and F up alot because I get nervous especially in bigger cities, and these cops nail you. It's like you're NOT allowed to screw up, at all, and even if I assume the speed limit is 65, and I'm driving like close to 75, and later find out its a 55, then I'm busted. It's so hard to friggin keep up with all the stupid rules and whatever.  EVERYTHING is a violation! It's like a police state, and theyre Aholes in person too. Totally friggin cold and unsympathetic and seem like they only want to meet quotas or raise money for the town.      It's like a business which profits from people like me,...almost like they need and prey on us, on top of which it makes us look bad because it's on our record...so its like we give money to the state...AND look bad on top of it!      So naturally now, whenever I see cops, I get lots of h@tred towards them, because my natural mental health problems like anxiety really get in the way,...and it's like u have to be perfect, and they don't care,...and Ijust don't like them OR trust them anymore.      I totally understand it when I do something wrong, but EVERYONE speeds daily, everyone messes up constantly, and I always seem to be the unlucky one getting caught.         It's like just before I saw a cop pull up behind me when I pulled up to use a bank ATM and I thought jesus now what? WHat did I do NOW?         I really don't like them.  It's like they're just trying to f8ck you over or something.         Are cops really this petty and out to get you and try to figure people out and all sorts of cr@ppola,...OR do they actually have lives and serve more of a purpose than hand out traffic tickets, and try to pick on the little guy and get off on it?      I don't know if this is paranoia....a lifetime of bad experiences and mistakes which now make me fear and lo@the cops, if its brutal honestly or what, but I want to get over this and perhaps start to like cops.         Any help?   I really just want to have faith that they're human too and that they understand, and that they're not total nazis.      Thanks.

Hooah there!!I am a US citizen and I want to bring my wife who resides in Bangladesh.My income level right now is less than 125 % of poverty line BUT starting for May my income level would go up since I have been ordered to actuve duty for deployment to Iraq for the 2nd time.      1)starting from May I will be very very busy and I will be moving around a lot.New york New Jersey Texas,Kuwait and then finally to Iraq.    In this type of scenario should I hire a lawyer and let him deal with the whole process since my postal adress will be changing frequently till I reach Iraq.      2)Since I have never applied for immiragtion for a  foreigner b4  and I am not an expert in this kind of thing  should I hire a lawyer again?I dont want to make mistakes and delay the process.         3)I know regular army active duty soldiers get more preference over  army reservists(those guys like who does  2 days a month thing) whne they need to show their income.Active duty soldiers  have to show money above 100% of poverty line while reservists have to show 125% just like any civilian.So when I enter active duty for deployment in the sandbox will I fall under the same catagory as a regular army soldier?      4)I wont pay taxes since I will be deplyed.The salary is tax free when a soldier is overseas.Will I still need to pay taxes since I will be applying for my wife.      Anyway thanks inadvance to anyone who answers.The lawyer fee wont be an issue and looks like for the time being my only wife will my M16 rifle till I finish my 2nd tour .2 days a month has just become 2 combat tours

20090309155804AAJUtcZ	Politics & Government;Politics	Will we in 2009 unexpectedly have a federal budget surplus?	Let me show you how fiscal 2008 could have earned all the amount of capital gains going back to 1997 in one year!      We have a 15% capital gains and remember 40% of investors have models that would already sell capital in the 1st quarter and buy in the 2nd quarter. this means 40% of sold stock in the 4th quarter of 2008 and 1st quarter in 2009 paid double capital gains. The loss deduction rules only allow about a 5% deduction on capital gains taxes or 10% in certain circumstances and the market dropped from 16,000 to 6,500 over a 18 month period with major fluctuation. This means you could in theory take all the capital gains from 1997 to 2007 in 1 fiscal or $4.7 trillion dollars. This may be Obama's secret weapon because it takes 6 to 8 months for the treasury to get good revenue numbers! Note most people are now talking of projections!

Rhett Butler DID become rich in Democrat-lead imploding South, because he knew that Democrats meant destruction.      Here is easy method which works for me 100% of time. Naturally in liberal America no legitimate business can make any profit, so the goal is to choose corporations which will go out of business at earliest time.       I live in silicon valley I simply walk around corporate parking lots Yahoo, Google, Intel, Sun Microsystems, etc. and I count Obama stickers. At Yahoo headquarters parking lot in Sunnivale for example Obama stickers outnumber McCain stickers 10 to 1. The inevitable conclusion is that Yahoo Corp is heavily infested with the liberals and it is poised to fail.      The rest is easy. I sold short 10.000 shares of YHOO 3 years ago at $30 today the price is $13. I made $17,000 by simply counting the rate of liberal infestation, and I have no intention to close my short position. Yahoo Corp is doomed and I will eventually realize entire $30,000 profit because the liberals are there.

20090225090015AADuYrb	Politics & Government;Politics	Electric cars from China, can we compete?	The number of electric cars China will export to America this year is   only 4,800, but China is good at increasing production very rapidly.   Notice that the price is 30,000 to 35,000 Yuan. At the moment, a Yuan   is worth .1462 dollars. That means that the 35,000 Yuan electric car   is priced at $5,117. That is so far below the price that the American   automakers are going to be able to produce at that it looks like China   will end up cornering the market for electric cars in America. Due to   the need to borrow many hundreds of millions of dollars from China to   pay for the stimulus packages, and to borrow much money to pay   interest on the foreign debt in the future, plus borrowing to finance   the trade deficit in the future, China won't let us charge a high   enough tariff on the Chinese electric cars to make American cars   competitive.

Last night myself and two other 15 year olds snuck out and met up on route one, because one of them was suicidal and needed comfort. There is no curfew for teenagers in this town, and we have done this before with cops passing by and it was never a problem. Last night they made us get into their cars and go down to the station to be picked up by our parents. They said we were in protective custody, but I've looked up protective custody and it says that its for either abused children (ironically, one of my friends was beaten by his father because of this when he got home), suicidal people ( the cops had no way of telling that someone was suicidal when they frost stopped us, and we didnt tell them), for high risk prisoners, and for dangered witnesses. Were we arrested? If we were in protective custody what were our rights? I was the only female and they took me away from my male friends, even though they told me that I would be able to stay with them at the station.

It was more of a cross between a closed fist and an open hand, with some pushing, too. Last night he got mad at me for spilling the last of the juice. So he went off on me and he started hitting. He did leave a bruise on my right arm. I havn't said anything to anyone, not even my mom, because i wanted to be sure that i wasn't making a big deal out of nothing.      I've never done anything to provoke him into treating me this way, we normally get along with each other, so im not really sure what happened. This is the first time hes ever hit me too, but I've seen him hit my mom once, about 2 months ago, i don't think he did it again, though. So in your opinion should he be aloud to do that to me, even if it was his form of discipline? Would you tell your mom or hold off just in case?      PS: Im 13. My moms been married to my stepdad for about 5 months now. And if possible is there anyone i could privately talk to through email?

20090227145246AAAuHK0	Politics & Government;Elections	Do you think the government is keeping information from us regarding Iraq?	I support Obama, but I think it's odd that he has suddenly become more prevalent about keeping U.S. power in Iraq since he has become President.  I read that much of the briefing about the Iraq situation was done "behind closed doors" which makes me wonder one thing:  Are things worse in Iraq than what the government is letting us know?   That would explain why Obama is noticeably more in favor of keeping more troops in Iraq for longer.      Maybe the government thinks it's best if we don't know how bad the threat is?   These are only ideas.  I'm not certain of any of this, but I'm just speculating.  Do you think my idea is out of the question, or at least possible?  Thanks in advance for any answers.

I would have no problem going in with him (the husband) and doing it, but his wife is a complete B"""" (in my opinion).  We both live in older homes and have work done to our houses regularly and she is always complaining about the workers, quality, etc.  Heck, she had a neighbor landscape her entire back yard for free and she complained about that!  Since the cost of the replacement is going to be significant 15-20K, I can only imagine the horns she will grow when money is involved.  What type of agreement can I make with them so i can position myself away from litigation with her when she decides nothing is good enough....i.e. escrow account, waiver of rights (???).

Seems like their advocating some form of racial gerrymandering so that elections can be "fair".        http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090309/ap_o...       The four liberal justices dissented. A district like the one in North Carolina should be protected by federal law "so long as a cohesive minority population is large enough to elect its chosen candidate when combined with a reliable number of crossover voters from an otherwise polarized majority," Justice David Souter wrote for himself and Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens.      Civil rights groups that urged the court to uphold the North Carolina plan said such districts help to diminish racially polarized voting over time because the candidate who is the choice of black or Hispanic voters must draw some white support to win election.

20090309171932AAeoFyb	Politics & Government;Government	What do you think of the "Free Choice Act"?	I am not a Union member, but I am related to many people who are Union members.  I am familiar with both the UAW and the IBEW.  (If I had a choice I would not choose to be represented by either of these Unions.)      Unions are looking for more Union membership through the Free Choice Act, if enacted by Congress.      The Free Choice Act, Unions are asserting will level the playing field with employers, allowing employees to obtain Union representation easier, without intimidation by Employers.      While I do know that Employers have in some cases intimidated employees into not voting for Unions - I do also know it to be a FACT that Unions have intimidated and bullied employees and business into Unionizing.       Taking away the secret ballot (that is what the Free choice Act does)  in my opinion, is not the answer.  I believe it will open the door to further threat and intimidation of the employee.        There are already many, many Federal Laws that protect employees who want to Unionize and Union activity.  There are even Federal agencies that specialize in prosecuting violations of those Federal Union Protection Laws.      What I believe the Free Choice Act will do is to force more employees into relationships with Unions in an effort to control the individual and take away your freedoms.  After all who better to silence someone than a large National organized Union, who controls your job and is now in cahoots with the Federal government.  (Atleast that is what I believe after Biden's secret meeting with the AFL-CIO)      What do you think of Unions and the "Free Choice Act"?   I have heard Obama supports this Act and thinks you should join a Union,  do you know if this is true?

20090309114151AAoG1vt	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I need some legal advice, please.?	About a month ago, a co-worker and I were in a minor accident in the parking lot where we work. I was pulling out of a space and she came flying around the corner and hit me. According to a witness, she was going approx. 30mph. The accident was faulted to me because I was pulling out. There is NO WAY this person was injured during the accident, but now she is claiming that she is so injured she cannot return to work. How do I got about this? I know she isn't injured, but she has already filed against my insurance. What are the chances she'd actually win this case considering the circumstances?      Also, this is her sixth accident. This accident makes the third one in her current vehicle. She has a history of calling in for back pain as well. Any advice?

This might sound like a rash statement to allot of people but I think that the law becoming more strict on underage drinking has done more harm than good.       I remember when I was under 18; my friends and I would drink in the local busy pub. We would still get pissed but we wouldn’t cause any major trouble. I look at my friend’s brother who is 15 or 16 which can’t get in the pub for being underage who is constantly getting arrested on the street for vandalism, being drunk and disorderly and fighting.      Whether it is wrong or right kids drink in our country. Wouldn’t it be better to have them inside rather than outside getting in trouble?

20090309122655AAiKz07	Politics & Government;Government	Why is Obama giving money to racist La Raza group?	Why not the black panthers or the KKK while we are at it.      Termite research, walrus rehabilitation and pig manure are among the more than 8,570 of earmarks in the omnibus spending package currently before the Senate. Critics charge the bill is stuffed full of so many pork barrel projects -- $7.7 billion worth -- that President Barack Obama should veto it.       Perhaps the most controversial is a direct earmark for a Hispanic civil-rights group -- the National Council of La Raza -- worth $950,000. The group has been a lighting rod of controversy since it helped organize large protests in 2006 aimed at derailing efforts by conservative congressional Republicans to enforce U.S. immigration laws.       La Raza, which opposes raids and other aggressive law enforcement tactics, says that the federal money will go solely to its community action subsidiary, the Raza Development Fund, which it says provides loans for housing, education, and healthcare centers in Hispanic areas, according to information on the group’s website.         http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/ar...

20090309124605AA0lDeb	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why is Marijuana not legal? do you think it Will become legal in out Lifetime?	I really do not see why the government has not made this legal yet. It could help the world in so many ways!! First off it could help by them making a bunch of money from taxing it. Second of all if it was on the shelves instead of Drug dealers hands there wouldn't need to be the concern of a deal going bad or people getting killed over the stuff. If pot was legal and allowed to be smoked then i think the population would be better off and more calm. people could just relax after having so much stress that life builds up. Its such a great way to get away from all the problems and just take a load off. There are no medical side effects to this drug. Nearly no one has died because of Marijuana use and i feel it should be the persons choice to do it or not. AND another thing. AMERICA is said to be free! and if we are free to make decisions and live how we want why is there so many little laws out there that keep us acting and living a certain way!!! If you ask me we are not free at all!!!!!!   A lot of people think that marijuana kills brain cells.. well let me tell you.. marijuana is fat soluble and gets stored in the fatty parts of the body. so yes THC does get stored in brain cells. but it has been proven threw medical tests that it actually does not kill the brain cell. it simply clots it with THC and if you stay sober long enough for it to get out of your system. usually 1 month the brain cell gets UN clotted and returns back to its normal working state with no change in activity or having no bad side effect to the brain cell.

20090309123327AAWFwKl	Politics & Government;Military	Why doesnt Britain retaliate against the IRA like lsraeli style?	Israel now that's a country you call a proud country that despite what anyone says will do its job, make up its own mind no matter what in protecting its people from terror.      If an outrage like happened in Israel e.g them 2 poor soldiers dying like they did in Northern Ireland Israel would have turned the other guys home into a desert. Look at Lebanon and Gaza what they did to them!      So my question why didn't the British army retaliate by firing a few cruise missiles into County Armagh or other Catholics areas of Northern Ireland? and show them what happens when you dare mess with the greatest country on earth that invented Fish and Chips, Cricket, tea and crumpets, nice cool autumnal rains and the sliced bread?      Why dont Britain like Israel start taking out the Sinn Fein leadership e.g tit for tat like the Israelis have done so successfully against Hamas operatives, and nearly crippled Hamas ability to continue terror?      Why dont the Brits also attack the Republic of Ireland too and send a strong message to the Irish goverment and people in the south that we will no longer tolerate them supporting terror?       Why dont the RAF turn the clock 20 years back on Ireland and Dublin the same way the Israeli airforce did to Lebanon and made Hisbollah in the end Beg for a ceasefire?      Especially given the lesson that no amount of "talk" or agreement will suffice the terrorists given the fact Gerry Adams not condemning the attack on Sunday.

20090309130612AAE84yR	Politics & Government;Politics	If Obama is truly the Great Pretender, what will be the result?	Robert Samuelson, award-winning author and a contributing editor of Newsweek and Washington Post writes:      "Obama is a great pretender. He repeatedly says he's doing things that he isn't, trusting his powerful rhetoric to obscure the difference. He has made 'responsibility' a personal theme; the budget's cover line is 'A New Era of Responsibility.' He says the budget begins 'making the tough choices necessary to restore fiscal discipline.' It doesn't."      See the rest of Samuelson's comments at:  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/article...       * * *      The question is, if Obama is truly a great charlatan, a total pretender -- what will happen to us?  Where are we all headed under such crazy incompetent stewardship?

I have been trying to see more to this big issue and there are more and more evidence being presented. I saw that many folks have put in fault the Democratic Party and I thought, but it was the Republican party who had the majority in the Senate (2003-2007). Sincerely, instead of being misinformed I rather have a solid opinion with proof.    -Cheers!

There are plenty of examples of conflicts due to religion, but are there any which are a result of atheism?      And no, mentioning that Hitler and Stalin were both atheists doesn't count. For one thing, Hitler was not an atheist. For another, the fact that Stalin was an atheist had nothing to do with his atrocities. Hitler and Stalin both had mustaches, that doesn't mean their facial hair was responsible for their misdeeds.

Invalid attacked in Christchurch   Christchurch police are hunting two youths who attacked an invalid last week.    The man, in his 30s and who walks with a limp dragging one of his feet, was walking his bike through Hampshire Park last Tuesday when he was approached, Senior Constable Warren Dwyer of New Brighton police said.   The youths demanded a cigarette then money and stabbed the man's hand with a knife. He needed surgery to his index finger.   The invalid wrestled the knife off the youth, and stabbed him in his left buttock.   The main offender was described as Polynesian or Maori, 14-16 years old, medium build, short black curly hair and a wispy black moustache.   "This man was obviously an invalid and he was attacked in public view," Mr Dwyer said.   "There is also a young man out there who has probably sought medical help and is quite uncomfortable."   Anyone who saw the attack or knew the offenders was asked to contact police.

20090309130114AAtGS9u	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Who should pay? Is it right for him to be doing this?	Well this past Thursday, my aunt flew in from NY to get her lisence in NC.(She is 23 by the way, if that helps anything) Anyways, the night she flew in, her and my mom wanted to go get some "practicing" in before she went to the DMV the next day, but, long story short, they got in a big accident. My aunt was behind the wheel when she lost control of the car and crashed. Thankfully the airbags deployed and they got away a little shaken, but my mom got her face pretty scracthed up. But they later found out, that the car had been totaled. We had already paid off the car, so it was legally ours, however we have to pay $7000 to either get a new car, or fix our own. But my parents both average. $20,000 each per year,(they both are cash registerers at local gas stations full time) so we just dont have the money. Plus, my aunt was behind the wheel, so therefore she is responsible for the accident, But my dad dosent want her to pay because she is family. And also, she is a Nurse who makes alot of money,[I know because she carrys around calvin klein luggage, dolce gabanna perfume, and 200$ totes/purses.]      So who should legally pay for the damages, and is my father right to feel that he should pay for it himself?      Also, at the time of the accident, my aunt had a Learners Permit, and my mom is a licencsed driver, so my aunt being behind the wheel wasn't illegal.

I really respect the McCain family as staunch diehard Republicans. But who does Meghan McCain think she is to criticize the great Ann Coulter?      Meghan McCain, self-styled Republican party critic and Daily Beast blogger, has a serious beef with Ann Coulter.      I straight up don't understand this woman or her popularity. I find her offensive, radical, insulting, and confusing all at the same time. But no matter how much you or I disagree with her, the cult that follows Coulter cannot be denied.

Unlike semi-literate Barack Obama whom you shoved into my throat,  Pres Václav Klaus of Czech Republic studied at the Prague School of Economics, where he currently holds a professorship in finance.       He cannot believe his eyes to see how much Americans believe in government and how much they don't believe in the market.      He also believes that global warming is far from being proved, and the problem is that everybody has jumped on the bandwagon before any real debate has taken place.       http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12365502...

20090309125957AA23l89	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I had a small claims judgement in my favor. No payment, and she lives out of state, capias expired.?	I had a small claims case in 06' that ordered the defendant to pay which she never did. Also, the Attorney General in her state opened a suit against her shortly after. They contacted me and asked me to file a complaint with them and I did. Apparently, there were many consumers with similar complaints. All consumers were unaware that signing this contact, they were waiving their rights of a lemon law that most people don't know exists. Since my case has been over, and I didn't receive any pmt, I ordered a capias. That didn't do any good because the sheriff will not go out of the state to do an arrest. Meanwhile, the capias expired 11/07. However, the Attorney G shut her business down in her state and is still seeking restitution for the consumers. My problem is, she is not selling her pups in her state anymore, but she is in another state doing it, and still has her website up and running. I'm not sure if there is anything else I can do. I can't stand the thought of this woman getting away with what she's doing. Any suggestions? Sorry for the book.
