You need to call your doctor and set up and appointment.  You could have infintigo.  (forgive the spelling).  Surgery is needed to remove that.  Please consult your gynocologist about this.

cn3MPHpgaa	This rings a familiar bell! My son is 6 and still wakes up through the night, but my doctor advised me to get up and immidiately put him back in his own bed, no matter how many times he gets up. It's tiring, I know, but in the end your son will eventually get the idea that he has to stay there. The first year is always a struggle when it comes to babies and sleep...they just seem to clash! But I promise you it will get better! My 6 year old is the only one that has been spoiled (yes, I admit it!) and he's the only one that wasn't put to bed in his own room from 6 months old, and I'm paying the price now. Please learn from my mistakes and get your son used to his own bed asap! Children aren't easy, and to me this has always been the hardest part of child-rearing, but it's so worth it if you can be consistent!|`|07828b62c4af7445af6e1d173c965350aa	it happens. well your going to have to get used to it. Because its not going to stop. you might as well get some sleep while you can. you will find you may have to stay up , until your son falls asleep. don't let him sleep so much in the day. it will help. But there could be other reasons, like hes hungry, or needs a diaper change, or just needs to be rocked. don't let him sleep in your bed, you might roll over on him, if you aren't careful. besides thats what babies do, they keep you awake,thats their job. because their needs must be met, or they will never leave you alone.|`|6c231f02ac1e7ed0372cd39779f5b29eaa	How about getting a little futon into your room next to your bed. When he wakes up, he knows you are close and will go back to sleep. He is still a 1 year old. Some babies take a little longer to sleep on their own in their own room.|`|SK6DLCaRaa	My doctor told me when my daughter wouldnt sleep all threw the night is make sure her bellys full then she should sleep all night and sure enough she did.|`|Ltb7MbRKaa	Do you put him down awake and let him go off to sleep by himself? If not this could be a major point to change. Bringing him out of his room in the night is a no-no too. If he wakes give him a minute to settle himself if he can't then go in and soothe him and once he's calm put him back in his bed and leave the room. You can go back in if he continues to cry badly, but try not to. It could take about 3 nights to get the message through to him but it does work. Your bed is for you.|`|Dl00qHsHaa	Try cutting out naptime, and/or keep him up later at night!|`|fa38719d8736dc9f4d52fbb68952624eaa	Have you tried sleeping in his room with him yet?    You might also want to spend some time in his room, maybe an hour or so before bed time.  Play, read and then put him to bed.      He just needs to feel comfortable and safe even when no one is there with him.|`|d4tcbrQIaa	set a special routine and do the same thing every night.  Put him in his bed at bedtime and walk out.  Let him cry for a little bit.  It will be hard on you but if you do this every night he will soon learn that he has to stay in there and that is where he sleeps.  Make sure is belly is full and his diaper is dry.  If you know he is just crying  to get out he will be okay he will soon go to sleep on his own.  If you keep putting him in your bedroom its going to be even harder to get him out when he is older.  i promise this works.  I have a 2 year old and a 7 month old and they both sleep in a crib by themselves.    mother of three|`|ytnIP1Esaa	take away one of his naps during the day. try to feed him an hour before he goes to bed, then change him. Don't give him juice or any liquids at night because then he'll wake up wet and cry to be changed. Put some stuffed animals in the crib so if he isnt sleeping, he can quitely play. He should be sleeping a 10 hour night at his age so good luck!|`|a7ca1246b41935abdbf9c1c78fa658ccaa	LOL He's playing ya. This same thing happened to me. Of course, he wants to be in Mommy's room. In all honesty, when he wakes up go in and check on him, but DO NOT take him out of his crib. Try laying him back down and leave. In which he'll cry. Give it 5 minutes then go back in again. Lay him back down and leave. Then give 10 minutes and so on.     I have layed on my hallway floor for an hour at times, checking on her and  waiting to see is my girl falls alseep. It's a small torture to listen to them cry, but it works in the end. She'll have a relapse every once in a while, but I just start the process all over again.     The only time I ever let her in my bed is if she is sick. That is my last resort cause she sleeps really bad when sick. Try not to make it a habit or you will have bigger problems and he'll only want to sleep with you.    You're gonna be tired, but stick with it. Good Luck!!

cb1a1e7ec8bf20ce1e54663f30982e17aa	El ano no pertenece al aparato reproductor, por lo que no est fisiolgicamente condicionado para el acto sexual, es un rgano contaminado con el material fecal, con muchos microorganismos. El riesgo de infeccin se incrementa, pues el esfnter anal es mas rgido a la penetracin y menos elstico que la vagina, con la consiguiente mayor friccin ocurriendo mayores microtraumatismos durante el acto sexual. Tampoco tiene la lubricacin que normal y fisiolgicamente tiene la vagina. El riesgo de contaminacin no es solamente local, las microfisuras que se producen durante el sexo anal producen microsangrado en el pene y en el ano, que posibilita la contaminacin sangre a sangre, mecanismo por el cual se explica que el sexo anal sea el de mayor riesgo para la transmisin del virus del SIDA (VIH) y de otras Enfermedades de Transmisin Sexual.    El sexo anal puede producir desgarros musculares en el esfnter anal. Para los que quieran hacerlo, dara las siguientes recomendaciones: siempre use un preservativo, preferentemente adicione un lubricante a base de agua que lo podr adquirir en una farmacia. Y jams penetre la vagina luego de haber penetrado el ano y viceversa. Tanto para la mujer como para el hombre puede ser una practica muy placentera pero si se realiza con las debidas precauciones. El hombre tiene que tener en cuenta que tiene que estimular y tener muchas precauciones en estimular y penetrar el orificio anal con mucha delicadeza y suavidad, para que en ningn caso le produzca dolor a su pareja sino sensaciones agradables y positivas. Para el hombre ,no te olvides que tienes que acariciar a t pareja, el cltoris e igualmente si eres un destacado amante o quieres serlo y la quieres hacer vibrar, los pechos y algunos golpecitos en sus nalgas. Todo al mismo tiempo. Ella tiene que disfrutar tanto o ms que t.     ALGUNOS CONSEJOS PARA LA PRACTICA DEL SEXO ANAL.    A continuacin les mostramos unas prcticas que pueden realizarse independientemente, o una despus de la otra, para una estimulacin progresiva, que determinar el xito de sus experiencias anales.    Con la lengua: el anilinctus   Antes de detenerse en las nalgas, lama las zonas ergenas de su compa?era. Luego, contine con la raya, el contorno del ano, hasta llegar al mismo ano, zona muy sensible. En esos momentos, su compa?era empieza a sentir una sensacin caliente muy excitante.     Con un dedo o un juguete sexual  Suavemente Introduzca en el ano un dedo o, mejor an, un consolador liso y lubrificado. Detngase un momento, para que el esfnter de su compa?era se habite a esta nueva sensacin. Efecte luego un movimiento circular, que ayudar a relajar a su compa?era. Empjelo un poco ms hacia adentro, al mismo tiempo que realiza un movimiento de vaivn; asgurese de que su compa?era sigue sintindose a gusto.    Esta estimulacin puede resultar muy placentera. Puede realizarse antes de la penetracin anal, o acompa?ar la penetracin vaginal o el sexo oral. La mujer puede tambin estimular la prstata de su compa?ero y aumentar as la intensidad orgsmica.     Con el pene : la sodomizacin   La mujer puede estar acostada bocabajo, de pie (de espaldas al hombre), acostada de lado, o sentada encima de l : en esta ltima postura controla mejor la profundidad de la penetracin. Si optan por la postura del galgo, la mujer tendr que levantar su trax para facilitar la penetracin. Lubrifique el pene abundantemente (sobre todo el glande) y el ano. Comience penetrando lentamente. La primera vez, quiz no la pueda meter entera, sobre todo si su compa?era no est totalmente relajada. Pero con un poco de tacto y ternura, no se le deben presentar mayores complicaciones.     Antes de llegar a la mitad del camino, detngase para que ella se habite. Comience entonces a efectuar un movimiento de vaivnsuavemente. El hombre tiene que estar siempre muy atento a las reacciones de su compa?era, y detenerse si ella se queja. En dicho caso, se volver hacia atrs, hasta que ella se encuentre ms a gusto. El hombre puede estimular simultneamente el cltoris, o dejar que se ocupe de ello la mano experta de su compa?era, lo que, a buen seguro, le producir un orgasmo muy intenso. Alcanzada la cumbre del placer, el hombre se retirar suavemente.    Gua prctica para aficionados al sexo anal.    Charlaba hace tiempo con unas amigas acerca de ser penetradas por el ano, todas llegamos a la misma conclusin: "Es denigrante y sucio". Con el correr de los das y navegando en Internet, encontr algo de informacin al respecto y no pareca tan malo, es ms, ahora puedo decirles que es fenomenal si aprendes a disfrutarlo.    Decid compartir con los que deseen leer este documento, lo que creo es el mejor mtodo para obtener la ms placentera penetracin anal. Comenzaremos con unas peque?as observaciones:    1. El sexo anal puede ser divertido, seguro y entretenido si sigues los pasos adecuados para  seguir mantenindolo seguro, de lo contrario puede ser doloroso e incluso peligroso.    2. El ano puede ser una zona extremadamente ergena, pues dentro de ste se encuentran mucho  ms terminales nerviosas que en otras partes del cuerpo, excepto el cltoris.    3. La diversin inicia desde que comienzas a acariciar tu ano, o el de tu pareja, con un dedo lubricado, intercambiarlo por el pene o sustituirlo con el uso de juguetes sexuales o vibrador.    Para poder disfrutar esta variedad del sexo es necesario olvidarse de prejuicios y temores al respecto, ya que debemos considerar que:    1. El sexo anal no es una prctica exclusiva de los homosexuales, aunque claro, ellos lo practican, pero tambin es una de las formas de sexo preferidas por algunas parejas heterosexuales.    2.

As far as i know employers never really want to hire pregnant women because later down the road they know they have to give them leave and that they may not even come back. So its not a bad thing that you have not told them yet.|`|DHz46NJUaa	You need to tell since you are almost half way now...... Kind of rude to let them pay out to train you when you know you wont be there long In my option.    I told mine the day i found out.
FdQTkYLzaa	yes you could be pregnant. Sometimes when the fertilized egg nests in the uterus it produces a short bleeding that could get confused with your period. I recommend you take a pregnancy test or even better consult with your OBGYN.|`|2842e23df90fbee0e32380e1af7d286baa	Probablly not...sorry|`|d8043f9c983ac001a490a18c9fc2a60aaa	I doubt it Hun,but to be sure take a test|`|dcZi6Iqvaa	yes, you may very well be pregnant. Was your period on time for you? or a little early maybe? It may not be a period at all it may just be bleeding from where the egg attached itself to the placenta. or some other thing like that. To know for sure you need to take a test. It may be a bit soon to take it, you may want to wait a while, since it could very well be a regular period. If it shows up negative,(get the 2pack) rest your mind a while, but try again anyway about 10days later. Hopefully you get another negative and it was just fluky that all that happened at once. if either of them turn out positive-go to a clinic and get a blood test. There have been false positives and false negatives plenty of times with home tests. I hope that helps you in knowing what all to do.|`|H1uTMdY7aa	it sounds like you are|`|dc7df0bd42b0ecffe577a0f1252b08a1aa	I don't think you're pregnant. You might want to take a test in a few weeks just for peace of mind. And, if pregnancy is not something you want right now, go on the pill so you don't have to worry about this. Good luck! :-)
VjD8OYc8aa	could still be pregnant my sister did 2 home tests that came back neg went to doctors had 1 blood and 1 urine all came back negative , then a few weeks later went to hospital with bad stomache cramps and found out she was 13wks pregnant, anythings possible.  you should get checked out though to find out one way or the other and to rule out any infections.   good luck|`|ARMd19PYaa	sometimes the test are wrong go to the doctor or a pregnacy center or health center to make sure what's going on .  it will also rule out any other health problems.|`|VuTVusbdaa	You could be pregnut|`|ekZJdp58aa	i am in the extact same postion at the moment my last period was 27th Jan i took three HPT last one on the 18th March and it was neg. Im going doctors this week to ask for a blood test.    You could be pregnant you do have some syptoms i would go to the doctors to check.    Good Luck|`|T9FLQUV6aa	I am having the same problem! I havent had a period since Feb 1st and I have tried hpt and they have all been negative. I have heard that you can get negative hpt and get a positive blood test, so I am going to make an apointment to find out. Good Luck, I feel for ya!|`|nkRn9CRFaa	I think you should see your doctor. It sounds like you are but i would ask the doc.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	See your doctor. Having no periods could be caused by many things. Have you lost or gained a lot of weight recently? Do you exercise a lot? Been stressed? They could all cause this to happen. It may also a symptom of a hormone or thyroid disorder. There are many different reasons. Best thing to do is get checked out. :-)
AA11518111	The depo shot has a lot of side effects but I can't imagine you having them a year or 2 years later.  Honestly you could be pregnant and the hcg hormone is not strong enough in your body yet to show on the preg tests.  Did you take it first thing in the morning?  Since you are a mom, do you think or just have that "i just know" feeling?|`|ZFV16jy6aa	COULD BE STRESS OF NOT STARTING OR JUST STRESS IN GENERAL.   ALSO I DON'T KNOW YOUR AGE, BUT IT COULD BE THE START OF MENOPAUSE.   I KNOW MY AUNT HAD EARLY STAGES AND SHE WAS IN HER EARLY 30'S. MANY WOMEN START EARLY AND OTHER HAVE THEIRS LATE. SO GO TO A DR AND HAVE AN EXAM AND SUCH.   HAVE THEM RUN SOME TESTS ON YOU TO MAKE SURE.|`|9cf9e62d77bcbe59af662dac09704e2faa	u could be take another test 2 make sure.|`|AA12285245	Maybe it's a hormonal imbalance.  Maybe it's perimenopause  Your doctor has to do tests to tell for sure what's going on.|`|N46HcHvLaa	You should go to the doctor and ask him, its better to be safe than sorry.|`|AA10815464	If you're periods are really screwy than it could be chlamydia.
5a7A07GLaa	Oh I know how you feel... I'm also 5months, I weighed 130 and now weigh 160.  I am not trying to worry about it too much because you can lose the weight after the baby comes...|`|bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	relax, you are pregnant and weight gains can fluxuate. Keep eating healthy and you'll be fine. If you start obsessing about weight now, it won't be healthy for you or your baby|`|vm8HtVUYaa	I'm 27 weeks and I've gained 33 .. eeeek!  but I'm breastfeeding my little boy when he gets out here! :)  hopefully that will help me to lose some of the weight :)  and my blood pressure is perfect .. I feel great!    good luck! God bless!|`|AA10847957	Its different with every pregnant female, some gain the right amount of weight during pregnancy and some gain too much extra weight. I'm pregnant with my 4th child as well, and by looking at pictures, my medical charts, comments from my family, friends and husband, + feeling the way I feel from the other pregnancies. I've gotten much bigger then all my other pregnancies, this is the biggest I've gotten.     Total weight gained through all pregnancies:    1st Pregnancy- 47lbs/ a Girl!  2nd Pregnancy-  45lbs/ a Girl!  3rd Pregnancy- 33lbs/ a Boy!  4th Pregnancy I so far gained 49lbs & about 5 more pounds to gain on my last 5 weeks of my pregnancy. A Girl!    I'm pregnant, I eat anything & everything that I want, no control whatsoever. I only get to do this when I'm pregnant. When I'm not pregnant I watch what I eat + I'm a picky eater anyways. Thank God I'm lucky for staying only about 5lbs extra than my original weight after birth.     I think it also has something to do with the sex of the baby too. I think that when you're pregnant with a girl you intend to gain more weight than if you was pregnant with a boy. Girls give you a watermelon belly, your belly grows from the sides of of your weist. Boy bellies are much smaller & cuter too, less stretching as well. Boy bellies are more like basketball bellies.    Some people watch what they eat & some people dont. For the next 4 months you'll gain about a total of 15 pounds more. That's a normal pregnancy weight. Most pregnant women always seem to put on the weight tords the end of the pregnancy. If you dont want to gain so much weight, try to eat healthy foods, & scratch off the fatty ones.     Good Luck! Congrats!  Have a healthy pregnancy, & enjoy it while it lasts.    |`|6d13229862aed0f836e7130bb71dcc3baa	Your baby will gain atleast that much weight between now and then.  I wouldn't worry to much about it just try to eat healthy.|`|AA12202666	no, not very likely at all cause you gain most of your weight at the end, but you never know?? With my firsst I gained OVER half of my total weight once I hit 7 months (only a total of 19 lbs though) and this one, I am 24 weeks pregnant and have gained a total of 5 lbs, so I'm thinking I'm going to gain it all at the end again
a9461b5f4d3947f3d7745faacbfa7083aa	Oh my gosh... I am exactly the same way. It's crazy. This is my first and we tried for a while so this pregnancy means a LOT to me. I freak out about everything. I think it's kind of common.   I have found that when my curiosity gets the best of me and I look up things on line about certain symptoms, and complications that's when it's the worst!  If you're having a day where you don't feel the baby as much or your kind of crampy or just moody, try not to look for info on the pregnancy. It sounds lame, but honestly the nights I'm tired and cranky and I read my books and the "worst case scenario" sections pop up, suddenly I'm up all night freaking out.  Maybe it's the hormones, but I'm right there with you.  When you start to get upset or worried or overwhelmed, just try and take a walk, or a little nap and things will feel better after a little cool down time...  at least that works for me.  I truly understand, and if you ever want some support, and someone who won't tell you horror stories about pregnancies gone awry drop me an email.  I'm right there with you ;)  Best of luck and congratulations.  Everything will be just fine!|`|6d9b0dc26c4a5a91ffa60520f03c77c2aa	yes i was one of them but just be positive and think that your baby is perfectly fine which she should be b/c if she moves at least a little its good. stop being negative that just makes you worry to much|`|b8b06f4ecb41e0dcbbef0bdfac455625aa	I am 7 wks and I am going crazy,I don't know what else to do,Hellllllppppppppp|`|2Nl9tfIiaa	I am a first time mom too. I'm 29 weeks and I used to worry all the time cuz I could never feel him move and as time goes on, I feel him more and more. I always have dreams that something is going to happen to him like a stillbirth or something horrible. My mom says that is normal...everyone has dreams like that and thinks like that...at least the women I have talked to and nothing has happened. You just want the baby so bad and you think that it's too good to be true. I'm guessing that is what it is. Good luck!|`|323e6c81c81bf50962e25d6267a4b5ebaa	I think everyone of us is like that throughout pregnancy.  We are now responsible for another person.  I used to worry so much, one time I was feeling his movement down low and I knew he was head down so I jsut knew that he couldn't move his legs and that I was going to have a baby with cerebal palsey or something. (how dumb huh?)  Well I have decided that I am gonna jsut try not to worry as much, I want to enjoy this pregnancy because it passes by way to fast.  So my suggestion, just have fun, enjoy it, try not to worry, most likely the baby is healthy as can be!!  Congrats on the new baby!!!|`|5a7A07GLaa	These worries are normal... I am 21 weeks and I am stressed because I don't feel her move much too.....      This worry will go away when the baby is born... and then you will start worrying about your newborn.... that will go away and you will start worrying about your toddler, to your kid, to your teen to your young adult......    Part of being a mother is worrying that your children will be alright.|`|wcQeyt4laa	i'm 10 weeks and i don't even feel pregnant, if i didn't know better, i would swear i wasn't and that i was just skipping my period... :) well, all you have to do is just relax, speak to your doctor about any fears and know that you are not alone with your thoughts and worries, cause i worry all the time, it's also my first baby, but they tell me, like i'll tell you, just relax, sit back and enjoy your pregnancy... :)|`|vm8HtVUYaa	I'm 27 and I"m the EXACT same way .. I drive myself bonkers worrying about my son.  I don't think there is anything we can do about it.  It just means we're good mothers :)    good luck! God bless!|`|96f22823efd99713516ba5adc347f828aa	I was the same way my first pregnancy. I would watch the baby shows on tv, read about pregnancy on the net, and I went to the bookstore and bought a bunch of books to read. Try to keep busy or talk to other mom's to be in a yahoo pregnancy chat room or something like that.     It really helped ease my mind and a lot of them were old pro's at it. Don't worry you are not alone. Every pregnant women I have talked to that is going to be a first time mom has felt this way. It is normal. It shows you love you baby and care.     Good luck Congrats and hope this helps you some.|`|jZdAxYSlaa	Remember that there has never been a better time in history to have a baby! Never have there been such skilled doctors, such effective medications, and as much help and information readily available to help you deliver a healthy baby.     A few years ago they didn't have ultrasound scans, dopplers, epidurals etc...no-one's going to let anything happen to your baby. And with you looking out for its health and wellbeing, it's obviously in the best hands.    Try to relax about it and read only positive birth stories. The best thing you can do for your baby is eat right, follow your doctors advice and enjoy your pregnancy!    Best of luck. x|`|JAAWNXjkaa	Talk to your baby.  Look down and tell him/her how wonderfull it is to have them growing inside.  Tell them you are both going to be all right and everything is great.    If you have fears and worries, it makes things worse to constantly think about them.      Keep your thoughts positive and remember that pregnancy a natural thing and its been going on since the beginning of man.    Drink lots of milk, if you can.  Eat nutritiously.  It will help the baby and YOU.    Get plenty of rest.  Take walks.  Plan a nursery and pick out baby stuff.    Don't worry or fret.  Do not listen to bad stories about birth.  It's your baby and its up to you to provide a positive atmosphere for both of you.    Tell everyone you are going to be just fine.  My son would tell his still-in-the-womb son that he was going to be the best kid. He did this almost everynight before he and his wife went to sleep.    The child is now 18 months old and is intelligent and peaceful.    Speak life and you will get it.
a985f8bafead49ad632401aa87d44b44aa	Too much pressure from parents to succeed can make the child too nervous and hurt their self esteem. Parents should be more supportive and love the child for what he or she can do.|`|4d51e7b98e9d0813bb18bd4701645116aa	because parents always want their best out of their children.good luck!!!|`|7113d2ecd54bd8e6d4704f58cb73decbaa	so that,  he/she earns a good degree;  he/she earns a good income;  he/she marries a good guy/girl;  he/she lives happily with all the things that they need in life  he/she is well respected by others    The parents do not get anything. It is all for the growth of the son/daughter.    You will understand this only when you become a parent.|`|6xkCqYNsaa	motivating their childen is each and everybodies responsibilities.|`|ab87b62835440d759cc0f901ce9490c0aa	Because parents always think their child is the smartest, strongest, prettiest and so on. There is a very wise story about a crow that thought her little babycrow was the best singer of all!! If you have children, you will know. But if you realize that it is not humanly possible for a child to be best in everything, then you wouldn't put too high expectations on him/her and your child will be definitely happier.|`|NdDB1fWVaa	you will understand that when you yourself become a parent and have a son................    All parents think in different ways    but some parents want their son to take the first position just to show others and once their is a fall in any field then they accuse him alot.    but some parent what their son first position because they must have had such a desire but was unable to suceed so he want to see his son in that position.    but it is good to encourage children to take first position but should never make him feel pressurized and stressed.  if he happens to lose then should understand and encourage next time instead of scolding and punishing,    afterall it is their child but can mentally disturb your child until the child will feel like escaping and escaping through any means  hope you understand|`|lvRoVs55aa	Because   1. That's what they always wanted to do themselves, and they want their kids to fulfill things they themselves couldn't.  2. Better social esteem, parents of topper kids fancy themselves as better parents.|`|tWD5AEQRaa	Because they want the best for their son and the success of their son is also their success and can be proud of. But I think parents should not pressure their son for beating the top. What they should do is to motivate their son properly without any pressure and praise them even with the small things their son did.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	A prenatal DNA test taken during pregnancy is done via Chorionic Villi Sampling or Amnioscentesis tests.  Depending on which of these procedures you are having done, it would be between 11-20 weeks or so.  These tests are only done when necessary, however, as they pose risks-a doctor will not perform one just to test DNA to establish paternity.  You also still have to pay for the paternity test, although insurance might cover the retrieval of the sample being tested since it is done for a medical reason.    Around 13 weeks of pregnancy, there is a DNA test that can be done using the mother's blood.  They isolate fetal cells that have been discarded into the mother's blood and test those.  The risk of this is the same as having any blood drawn, but the test is quite expensive (around $1,000 or more).  Insurance does not cover it, so the parents must pay for it in full themselves.      Of course, with either test you have to also have the father tested (either blood or buccal-aka cheek-swab), or a sample such as hair that DNA can be extracted from.    Usually with the fetal cell test, the company will run a second test after the baby is born to confirm the results, but they guarantee the results the same as a traditional DNA test.    A D&C is a procedure that cleans out the uterus, usually after a miscarriage.  They dilate the cervix and remove the contents of the uterus.    EDITED TO ASK: Why the thumbs down?  I gave a factual answer.|`|db1bee1992e6439478c94c69e5ad4b62aa	D&C is when they dilate you and clean out your uterus..it's an abortion precedure, or is often done in result of a miscarriage(I had 1 due to miscarriage). DNA tests can be done by Amnio during pregnancy, which is where they put a fine needle through into your uterus and take blood from the baby..can be done anytime in pregnancy, but runs the risk of miscarriage..best to way until the baby is born.|`|e7bc222fa0b57adc181abe207a015454aa	A DNA test should not be performed until after the child is born, it can pose unnecessary health risks to the unborn child.  If you did the deed and aren't sure of the father, at least wait the 9 months to find out instead of potentially harming the baby.  A D & C is Dilation and Curettage.  It is when the cervix is dilated and the lining of the uterus is scraped and removed.    EDIT:  D & C's aren't always done for abortions (as listed below), they are done for many reasons, including endometriosis and miscarriage.|`|inspW6Plaa	wh3n y0u d0nt kn0 wh0 y0 daddy is shukka 0r s0m3thing lik3 dat|`|vySOIt0saa	I have looked into DNA testing as my partner is certain not his (typical man no other man at all so think he is just scarred Ha) but its from about 10 weeks if you have an Amniosythisis. All you need is blood from the father. They make small insertion into the amniotic fluid and take a sample, they then anylise the data given from the father and from your own blood. There is about 1% change of loosing baby checking this way. Hope that helped|`|oW22gqTpaa	A DNA test can be preformed during your pregnancy but I am not sure of exactly when.
d15523b6f2eb977e0485a8956eed4c73aa	It is extremely unlikely, unless we are talking about an 18 year old adopting a 17 year old sibling if they were orphaned, but even then, it's more of an issue of guardianship.  I'm going to go with "no".|`|bn91qG9Laa	I suppose, do you want to adopt your girlfriend or something?|`|AA12130235	Yes, I believe if there relatives,(brother, sister) with no parents the 18yrs old would really have to have a job and other things to prove to the courts.|`|b7e223412867ed87d53beff69bed2c24aa	yes,as long as u are a legal adult u can do it. it's highly unlikely but, it is possible.|`|AA11019219	Yes, if they are siblings and their parents have left or died then the 18 year old could TRY to adopt the younger ones.     I saw a movie on Lifetime one time called "Gracie's Choice". It was the true story ( http://www.rd.com/content/rd-on-tv-graci... )  about a girl named "Gracie" and her one half-sister and three half-brothers. Their drug-addicted mother went to jail and "Gracie" ,the oldest, had to take care of them. The younger sister wound up leaving with her boyfriend and starting her own life. "Gracie" who was 16 got a job, paid for their own apartment, and bought groceries to help support her 3 younger half-brothers and prevent them from being separated by child protective services. So, based on that, yes, it CAN happen.     If you've never seen the movie Gracie's Choice I highly recommend it. It's a really great movie.   http://www.lifetimetv.com/movies/info/mo...    I hope this helps.|`|AA10755166	i wouldn't if i were you cause then its just incest and ewwwwww thats nasty...Hunny you dont have to adopt everyone you want to sleep with|`|1udoiFIDaa	I don't think it could, but i could be wrong.|`|eae4efef4b9e9d877e7f38b84e7afa60aa	NO|`|eC4K8Xp7aa	I wouldn't think so...but stranger things have happened
tZUSVuUvaa	Yes, it's possible that she may get pregnant. Do you know if she is on any kind of birth control? Theoretically, there should be safe days in a woman's cycle, but some women ovulate more than once a month and the time of ovulation varies from woman to woman so there really is no safe time to have unprotected sex.     I don't think the part about women being more fertile after having a child is true.     It sounds like you just need to ask her if she is or might be pregnant.|`|79ffc15d58a298e9070e8448ecc9660eaa	Of course she could get pregnant!! Don't ask her anything. If she wants you to know then she'll come to you. Plus finding out that she's pregnant can take weeks, sometimes months after the actual act. Just don't be a dead beat if she is. Be a man. Help her, take care of the kid.|`|37XcHETVaa	you should let her get a test|`|LT6iZ3braa	Just ask her when her period is supposed to come and verify whether it's come or not.|`|af1752626c14ff8171394da3e2e59bfbaa	Ok, so about there being certain days on which a woman can get pregnant-it's bull sh*t. There are certain days of her cycle where it's a higher chance of getting pregnant, like for women who want to, they pay attention to those days. But a woman can get pregnant on any day.   I think you should just ask her right out if she has thought about that at all, or if she has any worries like you do.|`|adbb668013d85bc39c2a01fe2e0a6631aa	It is difficult to approach a woman, especially if you are not in a relationship with her, and ask her when her period is suppose to be.    However, if you are totally freaked over the possibility of parenthood sit down and have a talk with her.  You will need to step lightly in this conversation as to not end up having your manhood run through a meat grinder.  Maybe you should apologize to her.  Explain that you were in a long time relationship where birth control was not an issue, and because of that you were not prepared (with condom) when you encountered her.  If you let her know that, sort-of apologetically then maybe she'll let you know if she used something.   Don't make it sound like you are apologizing for having sex with her, but for not being prepared for it.  Then you need to go out and get some condoms.  Your little man should always wear his rain coat.  It's not just pregnancy you are projecting against but STD's as well.  And you cannot rely on the woman to cover all the basis.  If you don't want to be a father, then you need to do all you can to make sure that doesn't happen.    As for a mother being more susceptible to getting pregnant again, that's just a load of crap.  A woman ovulates once a month, and when that is depends on the woman's body.|`|uywkWkxhaa	Just ask her what if any protection does she use.  Follow up in a few weeks and go from there.  Most important, change your bad habit!

6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	Don't be concerned. I measured small with all my pregnancies, but my babies were all normal weights at birth and came on time.    Women just carry the babies differently.|`|03f6f5775d57f70c2671a2bb3d90a1bdaa	Like it's been said, all women carry differently.  If you're baby is doing fine I'm sure it's fine.  I had a friend who was always very small, when she was due she was the same size as my friend who was not even 6 months along yet, she gained a total of 26lbs, all belly.  Baby was a healthy 8lbs.  Since since had other kids & carried them all basically the same way.|`|WEjldGxTaa	Im 31.5 weeks and am quite small myself.    Baby could stack on all its baby fat a week before your due. You could be on time, early or late. You can never really tell.    Its all just a guess-timation ...    Don't be too concerned ... You could always go and ask a mid-wife. They will provide you with all the answers your looking for.    Good Luck and Congrats!!
tcvTken7aa	fibroids are usually present in the uterus. i dont know much about them with pregnant women but they can be seen in any woman with a uterus. the fact that you mentioned pregnant women makes me think you ment to say hemroids. anyone can get them to men and women. the are very common in pregnant women.|`|yj4PaVLJaa	in any women......... but usually married|`|17d44d5f67b5fed7c2ae76d0a0c95b04aa	Fibroids is a term used for benign tumours of uterus is is seen in females all ages including pregnant females.
pgCE81FQaa	Your period may be heavier than you're used to, which may mean a pregnancy has been lost. Experts estimate that about 20 to 30 per cent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, so unfortunately this is very common.    It is only since pregnancy tests became so sensitive that people have realised how often early miscarriages can happen. In the past, these very early losses might not even have been noticed, and the woman would never have known she had been pregnant.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Sounds like either a heavier period or a spontaneous miscarriage.  Just make sure you keep your appt. for next week and mention this to them.|`|AA11057827	It doesn't sound like that you are pregnant.|`|af1752626c14ff8171394da3e2e59bfbaa	Yeah, I'd say you probably are having a miscarriage. Unusual bleeding can happen, but since you're having back pain and stomach pain...that's what leads me to say that you're having a miscarriage. The clinic should be able to tell you if that's the case or not. I hope you're ok...good luck with that! and good for you and your boyfriend for having protected sex(even though it broke, at least you put it on)!!|`|soKlEuTfaa	i think you are having your period and its just heavier not all of you periods are going to be the same some of you periods are going to be heavier and some might be lighter|`|ESnFtL5Taa	Yeah, I'd say you probably are having a miscarriage. Unusual bleeding can happen, but since you're having back pain and stomach pain...that's what leads me to say that you're having a miscarriage.
nGaD7Wvjaa	try a vaporiser as well. i had pneumonia while preggo and this helped me. sleep as much as possible and relax! congrats on the little one :)|`|YhgCq3yZaa	have i visited any GP? seek for an advice. u are now in the 3rd trimester. relax. try to control yr emotion.good luck in the labour room.|`|5kFocucvaa	Hot tea - be careful what kinds - mint, Raspberry Leaf are OK.  Try the Nasal Strips, the kind that hold your nose open, it may help.  Horseraddish may clear your sinuses.  My Father in law believes in sleeping with onion slices by or under your bed, so you can breathe in the vapors while you sleep.  Zicam works for colds, but I'm not sure about being pregnant and using it.|`|1660c2ea11d244c7d8010757656b59d5aa	This happened to me also.  My boss, also a female, told me that she had the same symptoms when she was pregnant and her doctor told her it wouldn't go away until she delivered.  Something to do with mucus membranes toward the end of the pregnancy.  Sure enough, as soon as I had delivered it cleared up - I mean immediately!  This happened with all 3 of my pregnancies.  I took Sudafed, which helped me, but you say you've already tried that.  Try taking lots of warm showers and drinking warm liquids like broths and teas.  I'm sorry I don't have anything better to suggest, but you're almost done - hang in there!
Ms9J3cs9aa	no|`|7HYEyXqDaa	nooo, don't worry about it. getting braces really isn't all that bad. i had them when i was younger and it wasn't the end of the world. (: GOOD LUCK!|`|40ZdU24Iaa	No, not at all. Getting them on is easy. They have a clamp-type thing to hold your mouth open and they just use some crazy glue to stick the brackets on. Just make sure to eat a big meal before you go and take 2 advils because it'll hurt to eat for a bit.|`|0GA5903Gaa	no...however if you are really going to freak out by the sounds etc and talk to your dr about it he might do it for you as long as your parents are ok with it. usually just extream situations|`|12164072b2f1324a27f3f66350e1d5a4aa	I got mine last week.They dont put u 2 sleep. I was nervous & I told the orthodonist.. he was so cool about it.He would explain to me what he doing & stuff. Time flies.Dont worry!|`|15baba335400ebf55a2d9ee34f1ca86caa	My Ortho didn't  But She Might be able to put you to sleep if you requested it, but I'm not sure, I know that they didn't put me out to take them off either so, I am assuming NO.|`|JTs9Th2Taa	nope|`|45d90ae365f733cad40a933870a497e1aa	not unless you ask for it, but it costs extra|`|3FXsum6Naa	no and dont worry about it it doesnt hurt when you first get them but it will hurt after ...onlii soft foods and use pain reliever|`|G9F7QYZxaa	No.  When you get braces, you they will have to put, cement like stuff in your mouth, and i'll worn you, it tastes really bad.   And you will feel a lot of scraping on your teeth, and they might even have to file your teeth down, and that doesnt feel to good either.|`|nJSLVDOkaa	Omg no! It is painless! It doesn't hurt a bit. But please make sure nothing is poking or annoying you. Of course it's going to hurt A LOT about 2 hours after they put them on. You going to get cuts on your gums, but over time, you get  use to it. I've had my braces on for 2 years. And you don't really notice them anymore. It's kinda like, a part of you.   Lmao|`|JjIMwruwaa	no, you're awake during the whole thing.  I've never had them, but I've had a lot of friends who have.|`|9ioBetteaa	Last time I got my teeth cleaned she offerd braces again and I told her I'd rather not. A few minutes later she started buzzing something around and I fainted, which makes my mouth close and acidently bit the nurse. I get to scared at any docters, for some reason. But no, unless you've got dentalphboia like I do, you'll be fine! Don't worry!|`|KVwklUd5aa	no!
6VtuN0NIaa	I don't have a magic answer for you but I do know that she's jealous.  Big green eyed monsters are clouding her ability to let them be themselves and I'm betting they are very torn.  I'm not just a step-child but also have just had my 13 year old spend 2 weeks with her dad and step-mom (who are able to spoil her monitarily as I can't) and I am absolutely jealous.  I don't really have alot of advice other than to allow for a bit of oddity on her part.  You are doing all you can by loving her kids but that may be her problem entirely.  I hate that my girly came back with all sorts of stories and memories that I will never be a part of.  But on the same hand, she deserved it and so did her step-mom.  About the baby, I don't know if it will help but the are indeed this baby's brother and sister.  I have 3 kids by 2 dad's (the oldest from a previous relationship) and my oldest has another brother that is not mine.  I don't know how old these kids are but if they are old enough to understand DNA, explain it!  They could donate half a liver, or maybe thier blood types will be the same.  No matter, always keep in mind mom's are a protective beast as you will soon know.  It seems that you are a very loving and generous person to want to be thier friend and that is a great thing.  If you ever want to talk, just message me.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|8wvxHyiLaa	she is obviously upset about you two being happy.  contunue to be good to the children and ignore the ex as best as you can.  Also, have your husband talk to her, or if possible both of you talk to her letting her know you want things to be peaceful. it may not work, but coninue doing the right thing.  the children will come to see who's who when they get old enough to understand|`|1HmMxeiWaa	Wow, this sounds tough.  I can relate--sort of.  I'm also a stepmother of a 14-year-old boy and 23 weeks pregnant.  Luckily his mother isn't so bad.  Anyway, I would just refuse to play these games with her.  Continue to be the loving stepmother it sounds like you are and explain to the children that since the baby will have the same dad as them, they will be half-siblings.  Then whatever they choose to believe is fine...they will eventually come to realize the truth and then will be angry at their mother for lying to them.  Kids aren't dumb--they can tell who's being mature and who's throwing a hissy fit out of jealousy.  Have your husband talk to her and tell her that someday these kids will resent her for trying to come between them and their father and sibling (and you).  She's definitely NOT doing them any favors by trying to villainize you.  Just be the one to set the example by being mature.  The kids will remember this and thank you for it someday!  Congratulations on your pregnancy and good luck!|`|75c305053a7c1bee386eeafabc74f780aa	What does your husband have to say about all this??  Has he even talked to the kids about this?    Please don't stress over this jealous lady, because thats all I see is jealousy.  She needs to make this relationship between the three adults go over as smooth as possible and the kids will fall into place.      Although I think this issue is between the three adults, I do think you should allow your husband to speak with her.  But give him some tips on what you think he should say.  Like its not fair that the kids should hear this negativity from you.  You should want your kids to be around a good woman that cares about our kids as much as you and I do.     Ask yourself this question:  If your husband was to pass away, would you still care for these kids as if they were your own?  Don't post your answer just ask yourself.  Because some women feel if it wasn't for their kids father you wouldn't have any involvement.  But show her different.    Something on that note.  But don't stress over this issue.|`|OtIdm3Oraa	Kids are smart and figure it all out in the long run, so just manage your own family in the way that makes you happy and don't get involved in the ex-wife's games.  I know its hard, but it will pay off.   Someone in my family is in a similar situation, and we tell the kids from the first marriage that everyone is equal and they are lucky to have so many people who love them.  Despite the mom's attempts, they seem to have gravitated towards their dad, stepmom and the new baby, likely because they feel a sense of structure and security.  Good luck with the pregnancy!|`|eECytyckaa	i really hate when ppl use the kids like this. tell there father to have a talk with them and tell them that they are a part of his family and so are you and the baby will be also. and that it will be there brother or sister. he needs to tell them the truth! he may need to talk to her and tell her that she needs to quit putting the kids in the middle of it. that you are not trying to be there mother just a friend. and that that baby will be there blood relative!

gugfkomWaa	I want you to understand one thing. Matter cannot be destroyed. but can be changed to energy.  In case of fat cells they can be converted to energy too.  In a day you need about 2500 Kcal energy for normal metabolism.  But if you tend to take more than that then you need to burn it off.  The other way is to cut it out.  Your input must equal your output.      One hour walk is 500 Kcal spent.  one hour of jogging is 650 Kcal gone and one hour or running is 850 Kcal.  I would say for your benefit walk leisurely an hour inside your house or lawn or any where once in the morning and if feasible once in the evening too.  But dont stop till your one hour is finished.  It is time of walking and not distance that counts.  Reduce your food intake to bare minimum.  If you still feed your child then dont reduce food.  Chew your food well but have variety and less in quantity.      Fat goes away in about a month or two but if you stop your exercise or go beserk eating, then the fat cells bloat and you are as fat as before in two weeks.  So you need food and exercise discipline.  I too was fat and lost about 14 kg or 30 lbs in about 60 days or so.  Read about it here if you like and do leave the comments.    http://looseweightfree.blogspot.com/  I hope my advice helps you and do leave your comments in my blog.  Regards|`|4affef38845d2de083301c5c68963d1caa	basically, you need to do cardio and eat properly.  It canbe hard to drop the weight after a baby... just persevere and dont give up!!|`|4MObZXlfaa	if u breastfeed u loose weight faster.|`|gLoVlRkKaa	ive gotten bets answer twice for this... i dont think its the greatest but its the truth. get a jogging stroller and push baby outside somewhere nice.. babies love it outside and it keeps them entertained, its easier than trying to occupy while on the treadmill.  I go 5 miles a day but thats just me. I started when baby was almost 4 months shes almost 6 months now and i have lost 20 pounds. As far as belly flab it could take up to a year for it to go down but as you lose weight it will get smaller.. everyones body is different . my stomach has never been flat so i really never expect mine to go down all the way.if you had a c-section it may not either because your muscle was cut. I say just do whatever exercise makes you feel good about youself and keep with it. Involve baby and think of it as a fun time instead of hard work and if you forget about it, you will start to notice the results... hope i helped.|`|IkfzcPiuaa	The best way to lose weight is doing exercise.    The best type of exercise for weight loss is something you ENJOY DOING and are likely to continue doing - not just while losing weight but also as you maintain weight in the long term.    Your initial fitness goal should be to do 30 minutes of exercise each day. Thereafter, gradually increase this (ideally) to about 60 minutes of exercise per day.     The best combination of exercise is a mixture of aerobic and weight/strength training (and stretching). Aerobic and weight/strength training exercises both assist weight loss but in different ways.    Check out http://fitness-secret.info , there are some great exercise for weight loss you can choose.|`|AA11481889	Relax...it took you nine months to get that flab.     Which isn't necessarily "flab"...it's also poor stretched abused skin and muscle.    It may take you 9 months to lose it.    If you are still tripping out on it..do cardio and ab work...the cardio will burn fat, and the ab work will help tighten up those poor belly muscles that got stretched to three times their normal length 4 months ago.    Good Luck

AND IT IS PREGNANT!!!!!! NOTE PREGNATE!|`|91hxNCfWaa	I hope this is a joke...|`|WrGq35zSaa	GEE WIZZ People have such attitudes.    I had sex with a Beanus 2 times and got pregnate with  twins  Then I sexed the Beanus 2 more times and got pregnate with twins again    Then I looked a a Beanus and got my eldest.    Simples maths and first grade speelin|`|EmYckZU3aa	I'm just gonna pray for that sad girl. She needs it, and I'm a loving person. *smile*|`|lWUknox6aa	YES!  Finally someone else understands my theory on gettting PREGNATE and having BABEES.    I had 12 last month but am going for 14 this month!  Wish me luck.    Any I Bank with Walmart so I will fax my food stamps right over ;)|`|GZdvHbT5aa	I found a link for 38 days..    http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/health/10...    Hopefully this helps her!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hehe course you can, good luck with your PREGNATCIE and 12 BABBYS.    I had to answer this question - 38 days till induction - OH MY GOD IS THIS WOMAN FOR REAL? You read her profile??     She must have no friends, or been bullied at some point in her life to end up as sad and miserable as that! At 22 years old as well?    Poor thing gotta feel sorry for her haven't you really.  |`|HGqmsaM5aa	Your kidding right? |`|GjuRYsITaa	are you board!!!???????|`|6Gfhvxn5aa	or bored even LOL|`|AA11328297	How could a Top Contributor ask a question like this! If you're simply a woman you would know the answer to this ridiculous question, but hey, some of us have a bit more free time than others and wanted attention today. Here you go... you got my attention!|`|a4a2BKHAaa	i hope you are kidding. even if you have sex 100 times you can still be pregnant only with one baby, or 2 or 4 at the most and they all come out at once after 9 months. please educate yourself. you can visit websites like http://www.easyninemonths.com for some info.|`|ueqLHjheaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!...    Please tell me that this girl isn't the representative of "The children are our future" poster! |`|bTbugHyaaa	2 points for me......|`|s4LWmcTjaa	LOL.  I'll be sure to sign you up for the most babies at birth record and for a Baby's R Us shopping spree!  I'm sorry some people have no sense of humor, but you are right, hormones must be playing a role.  Seriously, what's the fun in being on Y!A if you can't goof off a little?  :)      I think you are HILARIOUS!  You too Carrie.  When's your hubby due? :)
lEjoxYTKaa	It cuts off the blood to your brain so you pass out. No signals move from your brain to your body so you could pee your pants while you are passed out or even worse die. Dont play it, its dumb, you look like an idiot and you could die.|`|dFGXCh7vaa	it is NOT safe. although the people there didn't  die, it is a possibility. do not play it everr! haha.  i'm glad you didn't, and no, it's not safe at all|`|GHPFu1Ciaa	No,it is not safe...there was a kid that died from this game right here in my town,he thought it was safe,but it is not.You need to tell their parents that they are playing this game before someone gets hurt.|`|9FOHmjN3aa	Yes I've heard of it.   In 8th grade our principal warned us of the game.   We were all laughing saying "Why would anyone want to pass out".   It's dumb don't play it.  You could get hurt, be taken advantage of, or even die.|`|r9vT2RYXaa	I've never actually heard of it..  but if your passing out, it doesn't sound "safe"  what ever happened to spin the bottle?|`|dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	It's a stupid game becasue you pass out. It stops the blood flow and oxyen to your brain and could kill you, so it's not something I would risk. |`|yIUhw4WJaa	i heard of it  it's so stupid  you're suppose to feel high or something when you do it|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	Yes I've heard of it and no it's not safe and they play it because you get a sort of high after when you wake up.|`|d2aV5NTdaa	Yes i have. Type that in and type Oprah's name next to it. She had a segment about that and many people have dies from it. PLEASE DON'T DO IT. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND LIFE THREATENING. !!! I really don't want you to get hurt. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GET THESE PEOPLE HELP. This isn't a game it's a matter of life and death.    P.S. when I clicked on this link that game popped into my head and thinking please please please not be a question about it. PLEASE DON'T DO IT!    xoxo Sam|`|8znMgOCKaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO! IT IS NOT SAFE!  they choke themselves or hang untill they pass out and their friend 'always' take them off after they pass out.  they like the feeling fo being free, kinda like getting high.  DONT EVER PLAY IT. TOO MANY KIDS DIE!|`|yfxM0P8taa	Congratulations on having the maturity not to cave in to peer pressure.  If it's the game I'm thinking of, it can be dangerous and even fatal.  You're either older or a whole lot smarter than your cousin's friends.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	No idea, never heard..
5yAsj29Vaa	It could be a sign of preeclampsia.  Call your Dr. and schedule and appointment to get checked out ASAP.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Call your doctor right now or go to the ER.  It could be nothing (like sciatica) , or it could be very serious as in a blood clot.  It is impossible to tell over the internet if it is serious or not.  But if it is a blood clot then quick medical care can mean all the difference to you and your baby.    I had a blood clot in my 26 week with my first child.  Thankfully I got to the hospital in time and all was fine.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Cramping and swelling is normal, but it could be the start of preclampsia. Call your doctor so she is aware of this.|`|an8O7r4kaa	it could be a blood clot, they tend to appear mre during the end of a pregnancy, call ur doc or go to the E.R.
d5ug5W5kaa	none sorry  first off, james and keith are boys names  camilla is ok i guess  ur kid will get teased so much if their name is willow, moon, or a girl named james or keith,,,plz dont do that to someone. its mean.|`|VHHis05Naa	Willow is ok.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I love Brynleigh and Braeleigh but I dont agree with your spellings.  I like them a little more simple  Brenlie, Brynlee  Braely, Brailey    Scratch off James, Keith, and Moon for sure|`|qPd5G3dSaa	the only one i like out of them is keith|`|Elxuvon8aa	keith and Jmes for a girl?? No NO nO  some names are just not unisex  I really do not like willow butit is the best of your list/   I think of willow as being weepy like the tree .|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	James & keith are only ones I like.|`|bT4npA7Jaa	James & Keith for a girl?    Poor child.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Okay...James & Keith are not girls names.    Moon I do not care for, but the rest are pretty nice.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I like Willow and Brynleigh!!!!! adorable! hope i helped =p|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like Willow.  James and Keith are boys' names.|`|oFTbqICiaa	I like Willow. It is really cute and sincere.    Brynleigh and Braeleigh-I dislike. They are weird and too different for my taste.    James! I love that name.     Keith. Reminds me of quiche. Sorry.     I like Camilia.     Moon is odd.    BTW Were you watching One Tree Hill? James, Keith, Camilla....  Just Wondering|`|ozATw7s0aa	Keith and James are good for BOYS. Braeleigh and Moon? They are Sarah Palin's future grandchildren's names.|`|laVH1Bz3aa	Willow - a winner    Brynleigh (pronounced BRINLEE) - Absolutely not. Doesn't sound like a real name, will be mispronounced her entire life.    Braeleigh -  Ditto, but even moreso    James -  Classic, also a winner... ONLY FOR A BOY!!!! Definitely not. Seriously? Try Jamie for a girl    Keith - Ditto to above because its a boy name, but there's no female counterpart to my knowledge. Definitely not.    Camilia - I think Camilla sounds better, but I think Camilia is decent. Definitely better than your other options, excluding Willow.     Moon - Only if you grew up in the 60s and did lots of LSD. Otherwise, stick to something that doesn't sound hippie-ish|`|tkWBinDhaa	Willow like it  Brinlee ok  Braeleigh not sure..maybe you would like Brylee, or Bryleah I like those  james I like for a girls middle name   keith no   Camilia so/so  moon for a middle name|`|tpSSka4taa	Willow is sweet but the james and keith arent great girl names! hehe|`|SZdT1r8saa	I like Willow, Camilia, and Moon.  Don't like James or Keith for a girl.    Not sure how I feel for Brynleigh or Braeleigh.|`|mTTPLly4aa	my fave is camilia   i don't think that james keith or moon are verry good but I like the rest|`|T7uFoSUQaa	For a girl? I've never heard of a James or a Keith for a girl, but okay. I like Willow the best.|`|Fe1uTxkmaa	i personally dislike them all except camilla
18fPIBbWaa	no i think it actually sounds like perfect timing.  If they did conceive on the 25th it has been over a month now and she should be having some symptoms.  I think it's very possible that it is his baby.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Some women experience signs & symptoms earlier than others. I have experienced symptoms at day 12 of my last pregnancy's cycle & day 17 of my current pregnancy's cycle. You could almost say that my body reacts to pregancy at the moment of conception.    I had:  headaches  increased urination  nausea  lower back ache  bloating  extreme fatigue  All before I even missed my period!    Just as each individual is different, so is each pregnancy.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	She could be sick already.  I started getting sick at about 5 weeks then REALLY sick until about 14 weeks.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If the only time she had sex was 12/25 and she ovulates on a typical cycle on day 14, then she is considered 7 weeks pregnant. At 7 weeks and 4 days is when I had my first appointment and first ultrasound so it is possible. I don't know how trustworthy she is so your friend might not want to take her word for it, but it is a possibility.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	oh yes you can have symtoms as early as 4 weeks along at least I did...|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well...she would be about what, 5 weeks?  I know when I was pregnant before, I was so sick right from about 4+ weeks.  Violently ill actually.  So its different for every person.
J6vd8Gsbaa	ROTFLMAO I so would buy one. Although you are most likely joking this is to good.|`|75l2smfCaa	Im not gonna lie, I totally busted out laughing when I read this :)|`|m0PVHJIvaa	I think you should also make a flood of water coming from the vagina to simulate the water breaking...that would top it all off|`|8cLLhDrfaa	thats frickin weird as hell.  WHO THiNKS OF THiS SH*T!?!??!?!|`|em8A42Bqaa	sounds profitable.|`|t0c9sfEkaa	wow ur a perv|`|CJqK40uFaa	LMAO......u are crazy.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	lmao you can use me as a model for one if you'd like|`|g9ZFjl6paa	so funny i forgot to laugh!    troll|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Put me down for 3 please.
H88xNew9aa	Explain to her the reasons why you think you should be able to, and ask.  If she says no ask her why (in a respectable and mature manor) and try to negotiate (on reasonable terms) a reasonable time.  I have learned that asking my mom something like that requires showing her that I am responsible enough to follow through with our conversations.  If she says yes "if you do x, y and z" then do it.  You need to hold up your end of the deal too.  Work with her and talk about it.|`|MMwnFj1oaa	I don't see why she'd stop you. Just say "Well Mom, I'm pretty tired; I'm gonna turn in. G'night!"|`|cumUYHJwaa	You don't want to do that. I'm 13 and I'm allowed to go to bed when I want to, it isn't nice. I'm a very busy person, and you know when you have heaps of homework and yet your mum says "it's bed time" and shouts at you to get to bed. It gives you an excuse, and although you get yelled at by the teacher, it means you do get to bed. When you go to bed when you want to, you leave the homework, and then there's noone to tell you to get to bed, so you stay up until 1:30am doing it. I don't know if you understand what I'm saying or not. |`|1gVDZrPuaa	Just be like, mom I'm going to bed whenever.  I kinda said that but my version was a little more pushy maybe.    Edit: I get what the girl below me is saying, I procrastinate so much on hw, so by the time I get tired, which is whenever, I end up not doing it and I'm failing right now because of that.|`|dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	Well how old are you?|`|BRJxjGghaa	welli am a mother and i would say RE think this. Ask her if you can go to bed later and give her times.. I mean goin gMOM CAN I GO TO BED WHENEVA I WANT ISNT the nicest way.. Give her things you will do to Earn this.. I mean that is the smartest idea. you will clean up after dinner and clean the kitchen and help with landry If she lets you stay up a couple more hours.. I hope this helps..  
XfSvwiVDaa	Calm down, I had 2 miscarriages and the pain was much lower.  It sounds like (not trying to be funny here) you have gas. I know you are worried but just be calm like I said the pain would be way lower than your rib cage. Like in your female regions from belly button down. Good luck.|`|vlSLSV9Uaa	Hello,    I am a military wife as well, I had the same pains, I couldn't wait so I went to the hospital and I am only 9 wks.....I also have a 6 mth old daughter, after seeing the baby on the ultrasound I felt way better, go to the hospital so you can be at ease......it turns out I pulled a muscle in my back....also hunny the doctor told me that stress can cause pains.....but go to the hospital to set your mind at ease and good luck!|`|JhQ887Hpaa	Sorry to hear but you should go she a doctor to see what they are!    Good Luck!|`|hrz5xj4Daa	well i am 6 weeks pregnant and i too have had some sharp pains but nothing to major. i have had 2 MC my first one was right before my oldest son was born my second was with my oldest sons Twin i know it can be a scarry thing but stressing only increases your chances so just try to relax (easier said then done i know)  also if you are really really concerned about it go to the ER and tell them you are pregnant and having bad pains abnd see if they can do an ultrasound for you.  i cant tell you how manyu times i went to the ER with my second son just for an ultra sound and bleeding (placenta prevea)  hope this helps|`|0Zfh77Vpaa	It doesn't sound like an MC,  I had to have an induced MC last oct and it was just like a horrendous period pain right at the bottom of my tum.  I wouldn't get too worried, not if the pain is as high up as that.  It is a disgrace that you cannot see anyone till 24 of feb, you should push to get seen immediately........pls do try for your own peace of mind.......hope this helps  xx|`|560325ed6c6995c6435648c6c61a041baa	I would be concerned too, isn't there any other doctor you can go to before the 24th.  If for nothing else but to put your mind at ease.
xFt1O80paa	be happy the worst is over for now.  my last month was really bad too|`|em8A42Bqaa	I didnt have horrible morning sickness, it was bad at night!  You will start to feel better your 2nd trimester.  Well usually, I think that is the case|`|eeWY8vbkaa	You sound like you are right on track. I am so glad your morning sickness is going away, with my second baby I had it most of the time I was pregnant. Congrats on your new addition.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	The first trimester is the worst so things are finally looking up for you. It's all normal! BE HAPPY!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Morning sickness and your first preganancy symptoms start to wear off toward the end of the first trimester, You're okay.|`|IVNM1O5naa	It is completely normal. Some women only have symtoms in the first trimester, some their whole pregnancy, and some not at all. Every woman is different.
6gUp7e3Jaa	If you are in love you should get married but if you broke up for a reason that would come back you should not get married because then you would put the child through divorce and that is expensive and takes a toll on your self mentally and spiritually. Talk to him and see how he reacts and what he wants to do. Talk to your parents too they can help no matter how scary it may be.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would just speak with him and see where things lead. My ex and I have a great relationship and we never wanted to try to work things out. My son has it really great he gets the best of both world cause he is the center of both of our worlds.|`|1CgSVXxXaa	This is very similar to my situation. I'm currently pregnant, I'm 19 and he's 20. I told him and at first he was very reluctant to be there. But now, we both decided to raise our daughter together but we wouldn't be together. I figured being in a forced relationship would be more harmful to the child as opposed to being in a civilized friendship. It depends on your personal relationship with your ex though. I suggest the best thing for you to do is sort out your feelings before you approach him. Hopefully this helped in some way and good luck with your baby.|`|uM962JSzaa	I would at least try to maintain a happy household to raise the child in. Even if you don't live together or marry, try to remain close both geographically and personally so your child can have loving parents that care for each other as well, even if just as friends.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	I wouldnt suggest getting married. Just tell him that you're having his child and you want to have a relationship for the baby. That doesnt mean you should force someone to be with you. You should just shoot for this guy to be in the baby's life, and if you two can work it out and be together then all the better!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	You have a serious problem and big decisions to make.    Do you live with your parents?  Is there anyone (other than the baby maker) who would/could support you somewhat financially and emotionally?    I believe you have a moral obligation to tell the boy (clearly, he still is a boy) about your pregnancy.  I think it would be good to have made your big decision about keeping the baby before that.  Please try to enlist input from adult females (including your Mom).    I can't believe you can provide adequate care and nurturing for a child while you are still working (even part time) and going to school.  It is unlikely that the boy will be of much assistance in any way, after the novelty wears off.    Please consider placing your innocent child for adoption so that he/she and an infertile married couple can have a happier life.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	What was the reason you split up? The only right and responsible thing to do would be for both parents to be there for the child that way there is no question later on who its parents are. If you two can't get along civially then I would not suggest living together but if you can then all the better for your baby. Try to save up money during the pregnancy you will need to save at least $2000.00 that way if she is unable to brestfeed you will have money for formula, diapers, and clothes and laundry soap. the first year is always the hardest. Have a plan for who will watch the baby when you two are away at work. Daycare can get expensive close to $200 or more. Doctor visits are important too so if anything goes wrong the mothers health isn't being jepordized. $2000 may seem like alot for everything you will need for your baby but when the day comes that he/she is ready to come out you will have alot of spit up and food on the clothes and soiled from poop. One outfit will run you $5.00 or more and you will need at least 10 to start with. I know it may seem like I am rambeling on but I just want you kids to know what you are getting into with raising a child. It is a big responsibility that you can't take back.|`|xipapeHzaa	I would, but I'd want a paternity test first.|`|a85YzdTZaa	look this is what messes everyone up i strongly recommend you do not have the kid keep the jobs and go to school until you get settled down.  then you will be ready for a kid!|`|9FDAYDheaa	Tell him and pray he helps you out|`|PjvMR5Dyaa	im a guy but if my girlfriend got pregnant i would stay with her and have the baby and help raise him or her.|`|8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	you dont have to get married because you have a child on the way. i would say atleast try living together 1st and see where this relationship goes...who knows maybe in the future he might want to marry you not only because hes the father of your child but because he loves you and wants to spend the rest of his life with you. he doesnt know that you are pregnant yet. you should just go on and tell him. he should man up to his responsibilities but if not you can make it on your own. but just tell him that you are pregnant and ask him what he wants to do. he should want to provide a home for his kid and provide for you and make sure your healthy.    good luck with him|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	If you were never planning on getting back together then you should not get married or live together it will just stress you both out and cause fighting. It would be better to just have the baby and raise him/her in a loving environment, and if dad wants to participate then great! Hopefully he will help because it is the right thing to do and raising kids is super expensive.|`|qCj3BzWZaa	I got prego my one of my boyfreinds and we got married bc i was prego. i dont recomend it at all. We were only together for 2 weeks b4 i  moved out and really havent talked to him since.|`|o0CIX2IDaa	nope um children only need one parent just make sure the surroundings aren't violent

The first time I came off the pill in June and got pregnant in September (3 months) the second time I came off the pill in April and got pregnant in May (first try).|`|IVNM1O5naa	I wasn't trying when I got pregnant. I got pregnant on the first time that I didn't use protection and I now have a beautiful baby girl!!|`|d2b4cb30ef69fe8019f078327e17c342aa	Honey, when God's time is right they will swim, I actually felt a differant sensation upon conception, wierd I know but be not rushed, stay relaxed, be healthy and doNT do it on purpose and if child comes of this than God Bless but dont do anything you cant ever handle, this is human life not a baby doll, or a toy    PS THEY SWAM IN BETWEEN 14-17 DAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH--------EXACTLY, ITS JUST THE RIGHT TIMING
laVH1Bz3aa	Anything made up, misspelled, nouns, locations [except Paris], boys names used for girls, vice versa... because people love to be unique the list goes on and on. God forbid you give your kid a real name and someone else have the same one. Like that makes your child any less special or unique or something. Honestly people.    It just makes me sure I will name my children like a normal human being.|`|47622c7961ee42dfcd2111e029969318aa	HAIDAN or AIDAN. every one of those i've met is a sick bum. never name your child that i swear the name has a curse.|`|L4Y4QcSwaa	I don;t like really common names, well common for my generation like Jessica and John.    I hate Madison and billy for a boy but then i like it as billie for a girl.  I also hate made up names to the point of ridiculous.    I also don't like bruce, bob, george or caitlin|`|VHHis05Naa	Nevaeh and even worse, Neveah which isn't even heaven backwards...      Violet names:  Hunter, Blade, Gun, that kind of thing...    Boys names on girls... so overdone and trendy, even though the parents who do this don't think so.  Every girl in my daughter's class has a boys name except two.  Not as clever as you think you are, people!      I hate when those same parents (and others) then just further narrow down the acceptable boys name list until there are very few to choose from.  STINKS!|`|8dhe15MUaa	megen it a dogs name|`|Elxuvon8aa	I too dis -like Heaven backwards and I disspise bella names they remind me of elephants. I am really tired of the den names Jayden Hayden Aiden Kayden I really dis-like names that are places Paris Dallas etc. Charlott e because I knew some one but them there are Zoey and Chloe that are names of dogs and Olivia because it is sooooooo over used|`|FvhCUHjxaa	Unisex names I just don't like them and I feel bad for kids with them because usually they are terrorized. Like my exs new squeezes name is Charlie when I heard that I had thought he had turned gay and was dating a guy.

jenDDSr3aa	Your cycle is messed up and hard to predict when you are ovalating or what exactly is going on.  :(  So, yes, you could still become pregnant.      Missed periods can be a sign of a common problem for diabetics called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS.  It's related to insulin resistance.      When you have this you may have symptoms of hair thinning on the head, but hair where you don't want it (facial hair, arm hair, etc.), ovarian cysts, and missed periods.  The missed periods can happen when the ovaries get scarred up from ovarian cysts and it becomes hard for the eggs to come out.      You might want to ask your OB to evaluate you for this - or not because the treatment is pretty much the same as for diabetes.  But at least you would know what's going on.      If you have any other questions, we have a pretty active forum at DiabeticMommy.com  :)|`|AA11431032	yes my son is now 4 yrs old I did not have a period for over 6 months and I took dozens of tests and went to doctor I was 5 weeks pregnant.now I am 29 weeks and I have not had a period since april of last year
IVNM1O5naa	That doesnt mean that your baby is going to come like right now. It does mean that your cervix is preparing itself for labor. It could still be a while before you go into labor. You didnt say how far along you are??|`|vue9NOhYaa	It's effaced.  And it means that your cervix is starting to thin.  But it doesn't tell you when you will go into labor.  You can walked around effaced/dilated for months, or you can go into labor tomorow after being tightly shut at today's check-up.     If you are 40 weeks or more, you will probably go into soon. (Sometime in the next 2 weeks, anyway....) Otherwise ... it's anyone's guess.
3fk6bTMxaa	When your cycle varies it is best to use three different ways to locate your personal ovulation pattern. A resting temperature, first thing in the morning before your feet hit the floor and using a calendar method to track your changing body temperature is one method, you are looking for a a dip and then an immediate rise in body temperature,. Looking for body signals is one method, you will find that you may experience heightened sexual desire, increased discharge, clear instead of cloudy discharge, you may feel a slight pinching or slight cramping as your egg is released and begins to travel. Another method is to check your discharge on a daily basis, clear discharge equals fertile, if the discharge is cloudy you are not fertile. Using all three methods at once, will help you to quickly track down your own personal ovulation pattern.    If your cycle is less than 28 days you may find that you ovulate during your period. That will make your most fertile days the 8 days including just before your period, during your period, and directly after your period|`|1ba70e8c04280c60c3a0a80ba37658c4aa	it IS possible but very low chances of it happening. Did happen to a girl from my high school, or so she says but she was a bit skanky
OGiuuCDzaa	ah mine is too. she's 8 months and in the 0-3 size dummy. She's not dropping it either. If i try with a bigger one she will put the 'I'm choking' face and spit it out.I think it's best for them anyway. my daughter only has her dummy when she sleeps. For those who stated to hate dummies :    "The night-time use of babies dummies halves the risk of cot death, the biggest cause of death among babies"    True or not it's worth trying believe me it won't do your baby any harm (under 12 months old).|`|2PLxE7dsaa	My daughter did exactly the same thing, I can't remember what age she went up a size, but we just tried it one day and she didn't mind. Give baby the newborn ones if that's what they're comfortable with. I don't think it can cause any probs|`|wWai9xIgaa	I'm in the same position as you, my baby is 6m & she gags out the new size up so i'm going to let her keep newborn ones.|`|w1UDuUMKaa	You should keep your baby on the smaller dummy if that is what he is comfortable. Packages are just recommendations. Keep offering the larger dummy but don't fuss too much, just do what works for the both of you.|`|JY9TihJqaa	It wont harm him in anyway, but keep trying. My son only ever took one type of soother from birth until he gave it up - it was the mam diamond soother, www.mam.co.uk  |`|doeg7JSaaa	We raised 4 children never ever used dummies on any of them. |`|q3i4oUhraa	I never used dummies either, but that is just what worked for us. And hey, do what works! I wouldn't think it would not matter to keep that size. maybe you could try weaning him from him gradually. He may not be all that interested in it. easier to start the weaning process now than later.    I understand peoples' point in saying you can take a dummy away, rather than a thumb. Neither of my kids suck there thumb, and it can go both ways. Once the dummy is taken away, they can replace it with their thumb! I think some kids are just thumb suckers, and some just are not.|`|1NDHSSqwaa	My son point-blank refuses to take any dummies other than the 'cherry' style ones. I keep on buying him new dummies (the ones that aren't completely plain) but he always spits them out and i have to just keep on buying him plain old dummies (like the one in the picture).      I don't worry about the size of the dummies he is using too much anyway.|`|dd1c4772483cf17b8d588eaddff60b28aa	I hate dummies so neither of my sons had one!!    Surely it would be better to wean him off it??|`|RdprMxoUaa	My baby didn't even notice when I changed his dummy. I don't think it really matters what size they have. Maybe try again later.|`|60d6dd4034aed53b2101d9a2aa6f4e18aa	AHHH going through the same thing!!  my daughter is completely attached to the paci she had in the NICU and Ive tried to change it, style, or just next size and she hates it!  (4 months old).  Im still letting her have the newborn one to sleep but other times during the day I try the other ones and switch, I think if we stay consistant, the change might happen gradually.  My daughter is also cutting the bottom teeth, so Im wondering if the one she has now might be helping soothe the pain too.    EDIT:  Some children have an incredible NEED to sooth selves with sucking, it's NOT a bad thing to have as long as you dont have it too long!|`|0QYIbn1saa	Yes, my son only liked the newborn soothies until about 9 months.  Then he moved on to nuks (age-appropriate) with no problem.  It was strange!!!  He'll be fine :)  |`|toqMrT25aa	I have always given my daughter pacifiers from avent and she was so please until i got her one from gerber 2 weeks ago . she completely says no to it and wont even pu it in her mouth . i dont know if it is the shape she hates or what but Avent doesnt make one for her age . she is 15 months .      Before people say something , just know it is the only way she will go to sleep .
PfYcKQHLaa	Hi    I'm 22 weeks with num 3 and planning a home birth - I told my midwife (nhs) at my booking in appointment (ie 1st time you meet your midwife) this was what i wanted and she said was happy to support me but couldn't really plan till after 34 weeks..   You need to have an uncomplicated pregnancy - no high blood pressure etc..    Good Luck  Emma|`|eMDnLUpqaa	You can have a home birth. You just have to find the right midwife|`|HUrYSp4oaa	u will soon get yr first midwife appointment and u can discuss with them, u can have an nhs midwife for home delivery but not sure if they like it with the first in case of complication,however u will only find out by asking. good luck.|`|F89MNQheaa	Have a look on this site, it seems like there is quite alot of good things to know on there.  http://www.homebirth.org.uk/homebirth1.h...|`|MoLQsZeXaa	yes if you wish i think you can request a nurse to help at home if u want|`|hE7fK4W0aa	u can have a home birth on the NHS .. just ask your midwife or gp about it ...|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It really does depend on your local hospital and midwife care. Usually, yes you can - but remember that there is a national midwife shortage and a home birth takes one midwife all the way through labour and a second for the pushing stage - and they can't just nip into the room next door to check on another lady in labour etc. If your local midwife care is already stretched, they won't be too happy to accomodate for home births.  If it's your first, they will usually advise against it. It also depends on how your pregnancy goes, if any complications arise.|`|bZ1IYQZwaa	hi i don't know much about this but i was a home birth and i'm fine !! but mum had had 4 babies before|`|rTAvnldfaa	yes you can have a homebirth with nhs midwife, if you speak to your midwife they can advise you of what can be done in preparation x i know you get a home pack and stuff x|`|BXMx0WA0aa	I'm not sure I understand the question that well. But my sister with her fist had a midwife and assistant. With her second though she delivered the baby herself. She did lots of research and read books. She also video recorded the birth so there wouldn't be any legal hassel later on with the birth certificate and all. Best wishes.|`|UA4Ojtrvaa	yes, it is possible to have a home birth through the nhs. speak to your midwife and you can fill out a pregnancy plan. that allows you to choose where you want the birth to occur and how much assistance you want from the midwife!    hope this helps! good luck!
b2ZwhOqsaa	i have 3 and they havent either.. good question.
tQw6EDspaa	DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES give him arrow-roots or any baby cookies.  Yesterday I gave my 8 month old a cookie and he started to choke because it got lodged in his throat and I had to put my two fingers and try and grab it and he thankfully threw it up. He was turning purple and couldn't breathe. Please just feed him baby food. Try different brands of baby food or making your own. Just make sure there are no lumps so he doesn't choke. I'm sure he'll eat eventually :) \  Also, some babies don't get teeth until there a year old. Even after, if you're concerned about that. My son doesn't have any either and he's been teething since birth!|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Give him soft real food. I would ask a doctor to see what foods are okay for him to eat though.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	It's not up to him, it's up to you.    If he is wanting and grabbing for your food, don't eat it  around him. If you don't offer him anything but baby food, he will like it.|`|RjGGsPInaa	MASHED POTATOES~!!|`|auRHZadYaa	give him things like crackers that disolve|`|Fe1uTxkmaa	but a baby blender. then he can have most of the foods you have with none of the fuss !|`|QAN5OxWIaa	ok try to give him something sweet but baby safe like they make these little cereal bites that dissolve so they baby tastes something new an its still safe|`|AA11210405	Believe it or not my little girl didn't get her first tooth until 17 months!  She is now 24 months and has quite a few...they all came in at once! She went through the same thing as your little one.   Just take your soft regular foods and chop it up small enough and give him as much finger food as he wants! bolied potatoes, cooked veggies, cut up fruits, soft breads/sandwhiches, noodles ( mine loves spaghetti and mac n cheese) Gerber has some great  toddler foods in the baby food isle called "gerber graduates" there's yougurt bites, cheese puffs, cookies, etc|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	Babies don't need teeth to eat baby food because it is pureed, not much thicker than liquid. My twins are 9 1/2 months and they just recently got their first two teeth. There are also foods that can be mashed that are easy for babies to eat like mashed potatoes or mashed ripe banana. As long as he can mash it with his tongue and roof of his mouth. That is how babies eat until they get teeth. Is your baby sitting upright yet? This makes a difference in what foods he is ready for. You can also go to gerber.com for a full list of foods that are appropriate for certain ages and stages of your babies growth. Hope this helps.|`|AA11347204	well they dont chew with thier front teeth so it dont really matter if he has teeth or not|`|6ojGVXjSaa	ok so i am sure tons will disagree with me but here is my opinion.  If he just won't eat then (if you have time) try making your own.  You said he has no teeth so it will have to be mashed.  Now I know some of those baby food companies have you thinking you need to go through the "stages".  But if you are concerned about allergies then just go by the chart the Dr. gives you to add foods slowly.   Mommy have been doing it themselves for years.  No Gerber to help grandma!  Good luck!|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Babies don't eat with their front teeth-they "gum" their food on the sides of their mouth.|`|jaAolejUaa	try vegetables, just cut them in cubes dont mash, but just boil them soft enough that his mouth can mash them|`|pXSKSS3daa	Babies use the area where their molars would be to chew up foods(just like you and me) and most don't get them until well after a year in age. But does that mean you need to wait until then to give them soft finger foods? Absolutely NOT.    We started our son on 'table foods' at 7 months. He only had two bottom teeth in at that point but was able to mash up steamed foods with his gums just fine. Even now, with 7 teeth in, he doesn't use them. If you think your son is ready for finger foods go ahead and give it a try. Just make sure it's in tiny pieces and steamed if needed. I had to help Noah at first by either placing the piece of food in his hand or putting it into his mouth myself but after a couple of weeks he got the idea.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	be persistant, if he is hungry, he will eat, babies wont let themselves starve, if its such a problem hes losing weight, consult his doctor|`|vue9NOhYaa	At 7 months he still doesn't need any solids foods.  As long as he's getting plenty of breastmilk/formula, he's fine.      If he wants solids but just doesn't like babyfood, then offer finger foods. He doesnt' need teeth to eat them.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	My daughter is 8 months old with no teeth yet, and even though she wants everything we eat, we have to be very careful. I'd stick with the baby food for now, in time he will be able to eat what you are eating.

9bUN1AHFaa	Cycle Day 1 starts the day your period starts.  28 days later is generally when you will start your next period, although some people start earlier or later.     So 10/16 was Cycle day 1.|`|H74F8jxuaa	An average menstrual cycle is 28 days, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have a 28 day cycle.  You start cycle day 1 the day that you have full red bleeding.  You stop the day before you stop your next bleeding the next month.  You can write the days you have your period for 3 months and you can get an average of what your menstrual cycle is.  There are many websites out there can can explain it really well, like www.babycenter.com, www.babyzone.com, or www.whattoexpect.com.  I have done a lot of research because I am ttc and those websites helped me the most.  Also you can learn how to chart your cycles on fertilityfriend.com.  It is very helpful and it even has a free course of how to chart properly.  A lot of women do it and it is so easy once you get the hang of it.  It has helped me a lot and I know it will be the same for you.  Hope this helped.|`|ao4r5aPuaa	you count from the day you start.  if you started on 10-16, you next period will probably come this weekend.  remember you ovulate about 15 days after you start, which would be the time you can get pregnant. always play safe, especially for the couple of days you ovulate. |`|oqUlYXqtaa	you start counting from the first day of your period, that would be cd1 (cycle day 1) and you count all the way to the first day of your next period to see how many days you have in between cycles,    you can learn more about this and ask doctors online for free, try fertilityties.com  good luck!!!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	I don't think anyone is a bad influence on teenagers. Teenagers (not all) are just stupid and think acting like an idiot will expand their social network. It just makes them look stupid and pathetic. |`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	Why is it always rock stars? Why not look at the more popular genre like rap?? They talk more about disrespecting women, sex, drugs, & all that sh!t & today's youth listens to it more. Marilyn Manson is not near as bad as most of the rap I hear now a days.    Don't be bashing on rock & roll because of what you've heard about some of the artists. Have you actually listened to Marilyn Manson & Ozzy Osbourne? I'd much rather have my child listen to them way before I'd let them listen to someone like Lil' Wyte.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	Haha I don't think there is any such thing as music influencing a kid.

Sure it's become gender neutral, but that's in the last 10 years.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Audrey.  Aubrey is really a boys' name.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Aubrey is cute :)  Audrey is old fashioned. |`|Tc23KWgzaa	Are you sure Aubrey is even a female name?  I know we americans have been using that way.  I think, for harmonics, I like Aubrey first.  But my daughter would name her baby Audrey Hepburn because she loves the movies so much.    TX Mom  |`|OHfZFR31aa	Audrey    I've never heard Aubrey for a girls name. I've only met boys named Aubrey|`|xsiPET9Zaa	Well it depends, to me Audrey sounds very smart, and sophisticated.

Aubrey used to be masculine, and I used to babysit for an Aubrey Thomas, so I find it odd on a girl.

To me Aubrey sounds less stuffy than Audrey, I don't know why.|`|U9QSOLUtaa	I don't love either of them, but I would have to say Audrey over Aubrey.
r7q8LW7Aaa	I remember asking this as I was certain they got it wrong!  They predicted a girl for both of mine - and they were both girls.  Ask the sonographer how sure they are? They won't say 100% (just in case they do get it wrong and you sue them!), but if they say 90% and over, I think you'd be safe to trust their answer. Occasionally, they're not so sure - in that case I would buy neutral colours.... just in case.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	they have always been right when i have asked and i have had three|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I haven't personally but when I was in labour with my son another lady came in and we got chatting.  She was all excited about having her baby girl and went to the delivery suite and came back with a baby boy!  Apparently she'd had several scans that all suggested a girl but it would seem the boy 'bits' were hidden each time.  The only reason this sticks in my head so much is because she asked me that if I came back with a girl instead of the boy I was expecting did I want to swap baby clothes lol    Bearing in mind though this was 8 1/2 years ago =)|`|O4JuH8zmaa	It happened to my friend's sister but it's really very rare for them to just plain get it wrong. Good luck!|`|9f002741e4b69f1546eec0aa6f5f07f6aa	Happened to a friend of mine, she was told that it was 100% a boy, but she got a girl! they can get it wrong sometimes|`|ea0sWPUmaa	I was told my second son was a girl at my scan. Had a name picked out, the nursery was all pink and had a wardrobe full of dresses and cute girly stuff!!  my final scan showed the baby was actually a boy!! only had a few weeks to swap the girls stuff for boys, change the nursery and pick a boys name!!  think its best to wait for the surprise, was much nicer when we did that with our first!!|`|zoyw8CRKaa	My hospital in Colchester Essex will not let you know the sex even if you want to there are notes all around the unit asking us to not embarrass the sonographers by asking them, i have recently found out it could be due to the Asian community as if they don't have a boy they usually want to abort, and also i think for the sheer fact they could get backsides sued if they get it wrong.    Its never 100% so i think people should go into it with a open mind and still buy neutral stuff etc.    I cant answer your q in my own personal experience but they do get it wrong i don't know what the percentage is though.    Sorry im not able to answer this any better.

I am feeling like a hog these days. A little girl at my son's preschool was checking out my belly- I'm 35 weeks along-- and I was so paranoid all day that she was going to say something to him about me. I think it's a combo of all of these changes and all of the hormones raging around. Remember your boobs will be serving a great purpose!  Congratulations!|`|i20BqTjTaa	I think he is making a horny comment.  My opinion.|`|kGXiQI3Yaa	Tell him he's parkin it on the couch tonight.  He deserves that, and he'll learn.  Guys don't understand the intensity of our emotions when pregnant...right away...but he needs to know to be more cautious.  Believe me I can relate.  Normally I have a good sense of humor about myself but man oh man if anyone even LOOKS at me wrong I start feelin a little rage...|`|fdfzYLOyaa	I don't know why he would say that but he may not realize he hurt your feelings. It does not matter what he thinks about your body. if you feel comfortable then be comfortable with out the bra. you are the one pregnant not him. Its ok to be sad its just a symptom you get. You take everything to heart because you are more than ever more judgmental on yourself about your body. If he does it again tell him he hurt your feelings and walk away and get fresh air. You will feel  these moods swings more often then wanted. Just wait until you cant remember anything.lol

AA12316174	How long did you have the IUD?  Did you have a period while on Mirena?  Have you had a child previous to the insertion of the IUD    If you have not had a period while on Mirena Or abnormal periods for a long period of time it may be that your body needs to adjust to making its own hormones. I also had my 2nd IUD removed July 5th of this year to TTC however I plan on waiting 6 months after removal to TTC. Simply because that will be ample time for my body to re adjust and if any trauma was done during removal it has time to heal. Also pin pointing conception maybe easier.    If you had not had a child prior to insertion of Mirena it may have caused trauma to the uterus/cervix that is not allowing a fertilized egg to attach.     Best of luck and I am so sorry for your losses  |`|DcMoT5abaa	I'm sorry for everything that has happened to you and i'm afraid i can't help you with that one - you might get more answers to your questions in the women's health category x|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	ok, I just found your question a little confusing to understand so there's really no need for you to start shouting.    I know what its like to lose a close relative. Your not alone. And I wasn't trying to offend you or anything.    But anyway to answer your question....... I would ask your doctor, or a midwife or something. They'll have more of an idea.    I'm really sorry to hear about both your mom and dad. And I apologize too for reading your question wrong. I'm not surprised you were mad at my answer.|`|z74BXkhSaa	i havent been in this situation and i doubt any people have on YA so i will try my best to help you. if kids are what you want (and you dont sound too enthused) then talk to a physician and go online to sites like google, ikipedia,mayo clinic, etc. with the pain you're  in and teh medicine, kids dont sound like a good match for you right now. even though your mom isnt here, you can take stuff to God still|`|w5BVDGmOaa	That person who asked what it had to do with your mom was both, an idiot and an insensitive loser. I am a guy so I have not been in this situation but I am pretty sure you can still have kids so relax.|`|307e0819ddf76baa2377bbb05200b6e3aa	First of all my dear I'm sorry you lost your Mom. I know it's hard when you're so young to not have a parent you can ask these delicate questions.   My advice to you would be, Stop with the sex... If you have had and may still have, any sort of  infection you certainly should not be having sex right now.   If you "so called" fiance loves you he would not be putting you at risk for MORE infection by insisting you have sex.   The first thing HE should do is have him self checked out for infection too.   During sexual contact if one person has an infection it can and most likely WILL be passed back and forth between the two of you. and that's not even taking into consideration the fact that you could get pregnant, if you are not already pregnant. periods that are usually right on time, sometimes  at the very beginning of a pregnancy still appear, but be very scanty. go back to your doctor and take your boy friend with you. If he refuses to go, then you have some decisions to make regarding whether or not to continue in a relationship where your health, welfare and safety is not being considered . I bet my bottom dollar this is what your mom would be telling you if she were here right now. Do you not have a Father you can go to? Dad's can answer these questions too you know. Best of luck!|`|J55KHzgDaa	How did you get the infection? Either he needs to clean his dirty bell end, or stop doing unprotected anal and vaginal on the same night!
lARcutEqaa	Never heard of it but I used Preggy Pops and they seemed to work great if I had them before the nausea got really  bad. The second I felt nauseated I'd have a couple and they really seemed to help. You should be able to find them at a health food store (they are all natural) or a maternity store. |`|5OQLmECTaa	no i used what the doctor gave me but it just made me sleepy and i had to stop taking it b/c i wanted to sleep at work all day|`|ivpllZAcaa	nope|`|AA11222790	No.  I drink diet sprite and saltines to soothe my morning sickness.

CUFISZm2aa	the second trimester probably about 14 weeks +|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Be thankful you don't have morning sickness....not everyone does so count yourself as one of the lucky ones.  You should start gaining weight in your second trimester.|`|fRobG24Gaa	each woman is different. you are still very early in your pregnancy. I didnt start gaining weight until i was 5 months pregnant with my son.   Here, this should help:  To keep you on track, here are basic guidelines for pregnancy weight gain.    Pregnancy is one time in your life when it's perfectly acceptable to put on pounds. But it's important to have slow and steady gain and to keep your weight within healthy range for your body type. Here are some general guidelines -- be sure to ask your healthcare provider for specific recommendations.        Total Weight Gain During Pregnancy  If you were...    Underweight before pregnancy: 28-40 pounds    Normal weight before pregnancy: 25-35 pounds    Overweight before pregnancy: 15-25 pounds    Obese before pregnancy: 15    Carrying twins: 35-45        Weight Gain Guidelines for Women of Normal Weight:        First Trimester:  Gain 1 to 1 1/2 pounds per month for a total of 3-5 pounds.    Consume an extra 200 calories a day (for example, a glass of skim milk, and two slices of turkey breast).        Second Trimester:  Gain about 1 pound per week for a total of 12 to 14 pounds.    Consume an extra 300 calories a day (for example, a cup of carrot-orange juice and a cup of low-fat fruit-flavored yogurt).        Third Trimester:  Gain 3/4 to 1 pound per week (weight gain often slows during the last month) for a total of 10 to 14 pounds.    Consume an extra 300-500 calories a day (for example, a cup of low-sodium tomato juice and a whole-grain bagel spread with low-fat cream cheese).        Where Does the Weight Go?  In an average pregnancy, weight gain is distributed as follows:    Baby -- 6-8 lbs.    Placenta -- 1-2 lbs.    Increased fluid volume -- 2-3 lbs.    Increased blood volume -- 3-4 lbs.    Amniotic fluid -- 2 lbs.    Enlarged uterus -- 2 lbs.    Enlarged breasts -- 1-2 lbs.    Stored fat and protein (important for lactation) -- 6-8 lbs.

I think probally around your 5th month when you start showing more is when you should start gaining.|`|kv009HJmaa	It all depends.  When I was pregnant I lost more weight in the first four months than I gained, although it was because I had morning sickness.  Not sure what your eating habits were before you were pregnant, but unlike most, I found that I was actually not hungry as much in the beginning of my pregnancy as I was before I was pregnant.. and so there some loss of weight.  You can start gaining at any time, but typically noticeable gain is roughly the 3rd, 4th and 5th month.... and then after that.. all bets are off!
4iJqj2hAaa	nausea, feeling week, picky of foods and outbursts (angry at times) are part of being pregnant.  What you need is emotional comfort especially from your husband to soothe your mind and body.  Medicine could help a little but I suggest not to take if your sickness is not that bad.  You should also try to take fruits maybe your sense could pick ones that would suit your taste.  Lastly, try taking in milk and vitamins so as to compensate the lack of intake you are taking for the day.|`|a444ce229ba6f8866c092b8c43fef18caa	try to buy some sour plum from supermarket and eat it whenever u felt nausea.|`|YTWAYAoNaa	hello,  if you want read something about pregnancy   i just come accross this blog which may help you :-

EDIT (To BabyyGirl):  By "Plan A," I meant just taking precautions and using contraception so that "Plan B" wouldn't be necessary.|`|r7W0HqbVaa	Plan B is only for emergencies.  You are very irresponsible if that is the protection you are using.  Don't have sex if you can't handle the consequences.  You will probably be pregnant.|`|BQsVPV9Yaa	GIRL you are 14!!!

The rest of your life is going to be decided upon these little moments.  A lot of birth control that you have to be 18 for can be signed for by a parent.  Talk to a parent and ask that they help you in this area.  It is better to be honest about a sexual activity in your life than to have an unwanted pregnancy, if you are going to continue to be sexually active.|`|pstQvmMSaa	Go to your doctor and talk to him about it.

The chances are high that you could get pregnant if he came in you. My friend (who is 16 turning 17) got pregnant that way.    If you are pregnant, the first sign you'll get is missing a period. If you miss a period, you should take a pregnancy test and talk to your doctor.    You may not be pregnant, but yet again, you might. If you are not, see this experience as a warning never to let a guy ejaculate in you without protection. If you are pregnant... I wish you luck. I hope everything turns out okay!|`|ktv5mVenaa	You are aware you are NOT supposed to use plan B as a form of NORMAL birth control. Go to planned parenthood, get a pregnancy test, wait until missed period(if it does get missed), If it's NOT missed, get them to give you birth control pills, since you can't seem to keep your legs closed, and be responsible. Of course, here I am saying this to a freshman in highschool. A little girl that thinks she knows everything about life, etc.      You can't even legally DRIVE! Or work yet. *shakes head*   If you can't do it responsibly, don't have sex, unless you want a baby.

Sara has 8 kids by 6 different men and Tara has 6 kids and three of those got taken away. Oh btw, you owe child support.|`|C4Wx5sj8aa	Wow!!  If you don't have any information on this girl other than her first name, and from the looks of her name, Cookie, it may be a nickname, then I seriously doubt that you would ever be able to find her.  Why the concern all of a sudden, after 41 years?  Sounds funny to me, like a joke or something.....|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Way much to late to fine out now better luck next time................|`|KPkLwdn1aa	Not much to go on, dude.|`|YtY7yotHaa	That would be very hard to find. You don't have enough info|`|Jf9t5PBDaa	Are you serious?|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Sorry I am sure it would be hard to track down your prostitute but I will say that is pretty nasty not to have used protection...LOL  I guess this was the free love from the 60's...?lol      BTW Just kidding god why does everyone have their serious face on today!?|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	If I see her I'll let her know you're looking for her.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	you would have to have some info in order to find her, most likely she did not name the baby's last name after you|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	A little late with your concern....|`|AA12107422	Wow. Thats random. I don't think you can find out. It's quite entertaining tho...sry, lol!|`|JZUBjXRyaa	Its highly doubtful that you could have gotten her preg. from one time of unprotected sex.
muPiBQ3Uaa	Really doesn't make much difference.  Twins are always caused by the female. Either two eggs are dropped instead of just one during her cycle, (fraternal twins) or the one fertilized egg splits into two separate sections during normal cell growth division, becoming two individuals (paternal or commonly called identical twins).  In fact, a woman can have 2 different fathers for her twins if she drops two eggs, has intercourse with different men, and each egg is fertilized by the different men's' semen. Try and put THAT one in the family tree.......|`|ndvSK783aa	Very High Chance!|`|NysFTExhaa	The same as anyone else.  The only 'inheritable' chance for twins is fraternal and that's on your side of the family only since it's your genetics that determine how many eggs you release in a cycle.  If you are older than 35 years old there is an increased chance of fraternal twins because of an increase of eggs being released as you get closer to menopause. Identical twins are spontaneous mutations where the egg splits after fertilization.  There hasn't been any proven link to identical twins and heredity.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	identical twins is possible fraternal twins comes from your side, not his.|`|s1utniuvaa	Your body determines twins... fraternal if you release 2 eggs and identical if one egg splits. It is up to your body or the egg not hubby's sperm... sorry. If you were a twin your chances would be better but not him.|`|yOLeRiTZaa	Great Great Chance!  It is a better chance when it runs on the Males side of the family    Congratualations!!!      _________________________________  ~_~.      .|`|mTTPLly4aa	Only your blood line determines if you have twins. identicaal twins come if your egg splits. fraternal twins come if you have more than one egg produced at one time.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	100% chance i wish you luck.................................|`|IZuf3ba2aa	wellllll its every 2 generations.. soooo,|`|tu7aqUoxaa	I would say 50% because you are not a twin|`|nbYnGFPCaa	Maybe.It'll happen in some generations...|`|DutTBV3caa	i wouldn't say they're increased at all.  twins come from the mother not the father.       i asked the same question a few days ago because my hubbys dads a twin and had a set of triplets as siblings and thats what everyone told me|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My sister has fraternal twin girls.  Our grandfather had a twin sister and our aunt was a twin as well.  Both fraternal.
ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter was moving about during my labour, it made me cry because I knew I wouldn't feel her again.|`|Ela3o96Raa	When I was in labor with my daughter she kicked and moved around for quite sometime, right up until she really started to descend into the birth canal. While I was pushing, I dont remember any movement.    So yes, they absolutely can move during labor.|`|79rfx9gOaa	With my 2nd pregnancy, i argued with the nurse during labor. They hook up that monitor for the baby's heartbeat and contractions.. well when she put it on me, my son kicked the crap outta me. She said it was a contraction (and with no epi, trust me I knew the difference) but yeah they move a little bit until they start coming out.. then they never stop after they are born! =)|`|c5186eac9c2b70e449f12d24a1aaec90aa	When I had my second daughter I felt her moving after her head was out. It felt so weird. As for them moving into the birthing position I'm not exactly sure. I do know with my third daughter she was head down at 30 weeks and stayed that way. I never felt my other two children moving at birth just my middle girl. It was a weird feeling.
5yAsj29Vaa	Precum contains sperm, so yes, it's possible she could get pregnant.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	yes it is possible she could be pregnant|`|7PbJWEo1aa	You don't have to shove it in to get pregnant, nor do you have to come because of the pre-**** stage.    However, it sounds highly unlikely that she would be.    In future perhaps you aught to wrap it up before you slap it up.|`|cZksfFKFaa	I doubt it... but sounds like you need to start using birth control. My hubby pulls out and I was on the pill, and I still got pregnant!|`|OQsj0Am3aa	If you're really that worried go and buy her a test !|`|F89MNQheaa	If you put it in even just a little bit and if shes not on the pill and you have even just a little bit of semen on the end you can still get her pregnant, isnt as likely as a full ejaculation but can still happen, not to mention catch STI's and STD's. Practise safe sex! Always wear a condom :P good luck x|`|YmLIirIqaa	how old are you? you seem a little to young to be messing around and no i dont think shes pregnant. at all.|`|79rfx9gOaa	I would think from your story that she is probably not. I would have her take a pregnancy test though to make sure.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Most likely not. If you didn't have precm or semen nearby, she should be fine.|`|MoLQsZeXaa	if you did not *** dont worry about it but do a pregenacy test just in case|`|26MSs1Vkaa	She very well may be pregnant.     Good Luck.|`|sM2U5kgraa	if you didn't not *** don't worry bro you have nothing to worry about.... and about the period stuff.....girls usually get there periods once a month but it might come twice... so wait 2weeks to a month ill say.... if she gets it between then your free if she doesn't forget it...|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	I doubt it very very much she is pregnant . Good luck|`|FyjBwpWWaa	You need more evedince...was it unprotected?|`|AA11169206	If you didn't come then she's not pregnant.|`|rvIrmlTzaa	even if you're fooling around without protection you can transfer sperm  so it's probably a 75% chance she is  do not concider abortion (that is the wrong way to go)  look for adoption   good luck|`|csA1IZfVaa	A LITTLE BIT? i bet your underexaturating that!

C4miEeuYaa	I would like to think so. Give it a shot..The worst they can say is no..Be careful out there!! :)|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Falling on your belly isn't especially dangerous.  The baby is cushioned by the amniotic fluid & would likely not even FEEL the fall.    I live in Florida...we don't have snow, but we do have "weather days" when hurricanes have threatened or it floods someplace & we can't get to work.|`|em8A42Bqaa	If you have days that you can afford to use, use them!  I would and I drive to work :)|`|5f6XnInEaa	It's not cheeky if it's a valid concern...it's only cheeky if you knew yourself the risks weren't very high.    Since it's a pretty legitimate concern, I'd call up and ask.  The worst they can do is say no.|`|hoX7hoINaa	it depends on how long the weather condition lasts in your area. Cause you wont be able to ask off everytime this kind of weather occurs. So choose your days carefully.
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	If you have a period, your chances of being pregnant are slim.  If youve had 2 periods, its even lower.  TAKE A TEST|`|hBmafVYoaa	I think you are probably pregnant. First work out whether you are 17 or 18 then get a test. Kapech|`|1CgSVXxXaa	it doesn't sound like you're pregnant based on the symptoms alone, but there's still a chance. Best thing is to take an at home pregnancy test. If you feel more comfortable hearing the results from a doctor schedule an appointment or do both. Right now it's too early to read too much into anything.|`|UiQ6V377aa	you had sex SOOO many times before you think "oh,I might be pregnant?"  prevention is key!    SAFE SEX.    Take a pregnancy test. That is the only way to know for sure. If it is positive go see a doctor. If it is negative,wait a week,and test again to be sure.    Use protection next time?|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	if they wasn't regular i would take a test or see a doctor...|`|JsaEk8UAaa	If you are stressing your period will do all sorts of weird stuff. You need to take a test to be sure. Get a test for like $3 and know.|`|fEF2WoaYaa	well i would get a test honey i think you might have a baby in there|`|UEHm04oUaa	It seems unlikely. You should use some form of birth control in the future.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Very unlikely.  Take a test to be 100% sure.  Then you'll be less likely to stress over this situation.  God bless.|`|AA11448691	umm....no your not pregnant, also its way to early for symptoms.|`|Adq6y8tXaa	if you've had your period more then once i'd say for sur eyou are not pregnant but you never know just take a tset so you don't have to stress over it
r7q8LW7Aaa	Sigh...  I'll give you the same answer I give to everyone else on here that seems to think we have magic crystal balls...  If you are a female between the age of puberty and menopause, and you have a uterus and have had intercourse, protected or unprotected, ejaculated or not, there is a chance that you may be pregnant.  Take a test.|`|k8CjAhpQaa	Idoubt it sometimes when we worry about things like this our minds jumps to the wrong conclusions about small little things that any other day of the week u wouldnt even notice, please dont spend the next few weeks worrying, yes although it probably wasnt the best precaution we all have weak moments and no one is perfect, good luck and i hope it works out the way u want.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Yes you could be. No-one can diagnose it on here ffs|`|sSlRzn2iaa	ya u could be go see a doctor|`|0TrvUZPGaa	im in the same situation as you i really hope you get the answer you are looking for best of luck :) x|`|yd8QWaSFaa	Of course you could be pregnant!  Any time you have unprotected sex you could be.  Pull out method is among the LEAST reliable for preventing pregnancy.  On the other hand, its quite possible you are not.  If you dont want to be, I strongly recommend not doing that in the future.|`|rR5nIklWaa	yes you could be pregnat it only takes one time not 3   when u have unprotected sex u should take a test to be sure|`|cw6kcYayaa	I don't think you would start having pregnancy symptoms four days after sex. Yes, there is always a possibility when you have unprotected sex, but the only way you will know is if you miss your next period. It's not very comforting, but it's too soon to test now and it's too soon for symptoms to start showing.|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	yes you could be pregnant, the "pull-out" method doesn't work so since you had unprotected sex you could be prego. But having symptoms at 4 days is unusual.|`|vlSLSV9Uaa	you could but the only way is to do a test|`|ULgGWDnWaa	don't think you would be getting symptoms this early! probubly just your subcontious playing tricks on you!   Saying that though this does not mean that you are not pregnant! pulling out deffinitly does NOT work! You should be due your periods in a few weeks, I would say take a pregnancy test if it does not come!  (if it doesn't this could be due to stress of wanting it to come aswell)|`|FuMSBnaSaa	Hi Claire  A friend of mine became pregnant by her boyfriend twice while using the 'pull out' method in the 6 months they were together.     To me it sounds like 'honeymoon' cystitis or a water infection.    Get to your doctor is my opinion and advice.|`|qA1rxvxgaa	Firstly the pull out method, does not work ! from the moment he went inside you where at risk of getting pregnant, its something called a pre ejaculation it happens during intercourse so the possibility is very high, go and see a doctor asap     regards   ed
AA11064598	Slight discomfort is common but...Call your gynocologist or your primary care physican if the pain has not subsided. Any pain that is excruciating or lasts for more than a few minutes is something to be concerned about. Best of luck and maybe take it slower/easier in bed for awhile.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i had this, i still get it, i had a scan and everything was fine, im not sure what it is, if im having a number 2 and push a little hard, then it really hurts aswel, i dont know what it is, but i think its normal|`|xzh8r0jIaa	it might be round ligament pain, i had a lot of that  ***edit**  actually my answer sucked compared to the one before me, if its on a certain side than thats a more serious complication and i would call the dr to do ultrasound early|`|Xjaf9h5vaa	You could have an ectopic pregnancy.  Seek immediate medical attention.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	you could have just pulled something but i would call the doc and explain to them whats going on. and see what they say.|`|E0aptc56aa	try turning over simple m8|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	Is the pain in the area where your ovaries are? Thats where I had the pain, but mine was on both sides. Mine hurt all the time though and had nothing to do with sex. I ended up in the emergency room because the pain got so bad.They thought it might be an eptopic pregnancy at first so they did an ultrasound and found out I was pregnant with twins! It is best to have it checked out as soon as possible. Good luck.

It was so uncomfortable...    You'll need diapers, wipes, pump (if breast feeding), (if bottle feeding:bottles and formula), onsies, sleepers or zip up pjs with feet and hand cuffs, a few extra large receiving blankets, baby shampoo/wash, a pacifier...(if you find one that baby will take buy them in bulk..we were always losing them) a baby tub that fits over the sink (10 bucks at target), I loved our swing and bouncer...a bassinett or crib...baby moniter ...buy baby socks in bulk...they disappear....and I suggest buying clothes for baby in bigger sizes because our son was out of newborns buy 4 weeks old....they grow so quickly!!    **Sign up for baby registries at walmart, target, and babies r us even if you don't need the registry...they send tons of coupons out!!

Your insurance gets charged for all the diaper packages you open so it is not that big of an issue.... when a new one gets open put about 10 diapers or so in the bag... you would be able to leave with about 2 or 3 days worth of changes...

DO NOT buy the diaper genies... they are a waste of money and it is much easier to just have a small lined trashcan outside and plastic bags. also baby wipe warmers are not worth it... they just dry out the wipes... bottle warmers are not worth it either... all you need to do is place bottles with formula/breastmilk inside a pot of boiling water for about two minutes.... you need to make sure you shake it afterwards so there is no hot spots....|`|uGAcS3Odaa	Labor Bag (I am guessing this as the hospital bag for baby's arrival?)

gGeE4lkjaa	Certo il parto  una gioia, ma con esso la donna cambia il suo status sociale da figlia a madre...  C' poi un fatto ormonale che porta alla donna una sensazione di tristezza nelle prime settimane: questo non  molto preoccupante, si chiama Baby Blues; in quel periodo la neomamma ha bisogno di molte attenzioni e di sentire i parenti vicini...  Inoltre ci si aspetta che una neomamma sappia gi cosa fare e come comportarsi con il proprio bimbo, ma la verit  che l'istinto materno non esiste.  A volte si confonde il Baby Blues, che  uno stato transitorio con la depressione post-partum, mentre a volte si sottovaluta la depressiome...|`|6WBIx5ofaa	certo che una gioia, ma per alcune donne a volte  difficile   una persona non pu mai sapere come prender il part  certo ti cambia la vita  la notte non riesci a dormire  a volte non capisci ci che il tuo bambino vuole o di cosa ha bisogno e a volte si trova abbandonata perch nessuno che la possa aiutare e dei mariti che nemmeno dovrebbero essere chiamati tali  l'unicas cosa  stare vicini alla donna in questo periodo molto difficile dove si ritrova con la vita travolta in tutto, sia dall'aspetto che a livello psicologico|`|70ZIXvyEaa	La scienza medica non ha fornito ancora delle spiegazioni definitive riguardo alle cause del fenomeno, anche se alcuni studi imputano lapparizione della depressione post-partum a cambiamenti ormonali nella donna, pi in particolare nel calo del livello degli estrogeni e del progesterone, con unalta statistica di casi tra donne che accusano forti fastidi nella fase premestruale. In realt ci sono molti altri fattori che concorrono alla comparsa della depressione post-partum, perlopi di origine psicologica legata agli eventi immediatamente successivi al parto, come il cambiamento di ruolo della donna in ambito sociale, il timore per le sue imminenti responsabilit, il proprio aspetto fisico.|`|IhvYkXbpaa	Certo che  una gioia e personalmente io non ho sofferto di depressione post partum.  Non sono una psicologa ma penso che sia dovuto al fatto che ti ritrovi a prenderti cura di un cucciolo indifeso che dipende in tutto e per tutto da te e magari non ti senti all'altezza, hai paura di non saper gestire bene la situazione, in pi se ci metti la stanchezza del parto penso che sia facile abbattersi e cadere in depressione. Io spero di non soffrirne nemmeno al secondo parto.

Poi quando sono tornata a casa ho capito come si pu entrare in depressione post partum...non s se sono gli ormoni ,se  il senso di inadeguatezza, la stanchezza; fatto st che per un nonnulla iniziavo a piangere ( una volta perch gli trovai le orecchie sporche, mi dicevo " che mamma sciagurata, manco le orecchie gli pulisco!!!) .

Ci sono sintomi ben precisi, infatti questa sindrome  una vera e propria patologia se vogliamo, e non sono esperta in materia. Per sono mamma.    La nascita di un figlio  una cosa bellissima, ma una volta nato la vita di una donna cambia totalmente, viene stravolta. Il bambino deve poppare ogni qual volta lo desidera, spesso piange ed  inconsolabile, la notte si sveglia 3 o 4 volte, quando vuoi dormire non puoi perch di certo non puoi addormentarti e lasciarlo piangere nella culla. Una neomamma spesso non ha il tempo nemmeno di andare in bagno.  Ogni cosa che una donna prima fa per s, deve farlo per due: mangiare e allattare, vestirsi e vestire il suo bambino, lavarsi e lavare il suo bambino, se vuole dormire deve prima far addormentare il bimbo.  Spesso molte donne hanno mariti che non collaborano o suocere, cognate ma anche genitori che ti tartassano di consigli e critiche non richieste.    Detto cos sembra che avere un figlio sia solo problemi. Ti ho descritto solo un po' dello stress che comporta essere mamma almeno all'inizio. Per me sono stati terribili i primi 20 giorni, poi mi sono abituata e ora non potrei vivere senza la mia dolce cucciolotta che ora ha un anno, ho imparato a capire i suoi bisogni e i suoi pianti, come tutte le mamme d 'altronde, e cambiando citt mi sono levata dalle scatole suocera e cognata.

zTVogHL1aa	it's possible.  give it a week and try again.   Every woman is different. I know a lady who gave birth and didn't even know she was pregnant. She went to ER because she was in pain and Suprise Suprise, it's a boy! Seriously.|`|DKZCBF6saa	It is possible to have periods and still be pregnant. But think back to make sure you haven't eaten any dodgy foods. If your still not sure, or your nausea does not dissipate within 3 days, go see you GP. There could be a more underlying reason as to why you feel sick.|`|w05TELqAaa	Oh, FFS.  Yeah, you're pregnant. You got up the stick from kissing a boy, or sitting on a bus seat that a boy had been sitting on, or maybe a boy touched your belly button.    DID YOU HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX? If so, yes you might be pregnant - if not, no you're not.|`|BPMyrjvHaa	The best thing to do is go to your doctors and take another test there, they are more accurate and If your not pregnant they might do some other tests to see if you have a deficiency or something  Good Luck|`|358aaaa8c788b94641d4f774b758d97daa	ive been nauseous too. hope im not pregnant..|`|iikdZKO7aa	Its not likely you are pregnant, but maybe go see your Dr just to be sure.|`|cxoxosPvaa	it ccould be the flu or it can be pregnancy wait another week and tests again, if you are having unprotected sex it is a possibility, good luck|`|Xkln7qgfaa	Yep it's possable.

If you desperately want something then sometimes our bodies trick us into thinking it is.

AA11508016	You can get an ovulation test kit and basal thermometer. That will help you predict when you can get pregnant. Please don't stop breastfeeding though. And just take your time, it wull happen when it happens.|`|JiaUsCVUaa	Normally it takes an average of 4 months to become pregnant. While breast feeding it takes about 16 months. Getting pregnant the first month was a low probability event. Don't expect it for the second whether breast feeding or not.|`|DxtGnJsKaa	dont breastfeed because it makes it les likely to get pregnant. once you stop feeding then it will be easier.|`|ibiznOVcaa	Stop breast feeding and have a lot of sex then im sure you will FALL pregnant again. |`|a8921ed8d955b5a15045da0177eceed2aa	Having sex around the time of ovulation will boost your chances of becoming pregnant.

Then you'll get a baby .|`|4cprznZcaa	i cant believe that you are ready to have another baby so soon! your going to have 2 kids in diapers, and your going to have a hard time taking care of a infant and being pregnant, especially after you have the baby! why rush it? enjoy your son for a while|`|P9qxsLNQaa	I never heard anyone say FALL pregnant before.  Give your body a break! It is too much to ask of it to feed one child and produce another at the same time.  The stress will rob your body of its resources, such as the calcium in your lower jaw, for example.|`|q2grWHdKaa	Try having sex... that helps.|`|be07e2fee48477531cecc4228cb1dfa9aa	There is a reason that breastfeeding makes it harder to get pregnant.    It's nature's way of telling you to wait a while before having a second infant, so that you can care properly for the first one.
HCfVu9NNaa	Every woman is different.  Some notice at conception!  Others between 4 - 6 weeks.|`|T48smu01aa	Well its different for everyone...but I am 7 weeks pregnant and just now got morning sickness I felt great up until 2 days ago and it hit me like a ton of bricks...the only thing I really got b4 that was very tired and bloated with period cramps.|`|7SfksJHHaa	Anytime really every woman and pregnancy is different. I think I noticed pretty much right away something was different then I was really nauseated 24/7.|`|XcBrABWAaa	Well I'm 6 weeks and they only sign I've had (other than missing my period and the positive pregnancy test) is that I am really tired and my face broke out.  But if I didn't know I was pregnant I wouldn't guess from that. :)|`|nsme1Alpaa	i never really had symptoms of pregnancy. i got off lucky with that but my friend was sick every day for the first 4 months. every pregnancy is different.|`|64R0q42faa	I had no symptoms other than missed period when I was pregnant with my daughter.  With this pregnancy, though, I started getting symptoms at a little over 4 weeks.  I had slight nausea.  I'm now 7 weeks and am nauseous, sore boobs and fatigue.  It just depends on your body and how it adjusts to the changes.
pSY6LcFqaa	Honey...My boyfriend and i tried this method were both 19 and im 39 weeks prego. I had been on birth control for 4 years and i was on the patch so i never missed a day..this is not so smart method.|`|sXGfuKxwaa	DON'T DO THAT!!! Even if your chances for getting pregnant are not as high as if you did it while you weren't using BC, you can still catch STD's and you can still can still get pregnant. The only way that your chances of not getting pregnant on BC pills is 99.99% is when you take the pills at the SAME time everyday and you never missed one pill at all. Pretty hard to do when you have to repeatedly take a pill everyday. You have to be basically robotic when it comes to that. And pulling out is dumb because all it takes is one sperm to make its way to an egg for you to be preggers. You most likely need to use a lot of lubrication while your using condoms if it doesn't feel right.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	It's a bad method anytime.  Birth control or none.  Birth control fails too.|`|0sFyYrVGaa	I doubt you have anything to worry about.    But for future reference, my cousin is the result of a broken condom and failed birth control(yes, both.) so just be careful.|`|ExEI83mnaa	It's possible to get pregnant but it's not likely. But there's always a chance!!|`|f5tbPLq1aa	slim 2 none. but there are still swimmers in there i have been having sex without a condom for 10 mos and have never had a problem....  BUT i was recently on antibiotics and i may have made an oops b/c i think that i may be pregnant myself... so Just wear a condom i km ow they're a pain in the *** but unless you 'meaning' to have a bundle of joy then don't be silly wrap your willy! :) haha  good luck|`|ggo0etbEaa	there's still a chance.|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	You are really decreasing any chance you may get pregnant with that combination. |`|lAGjVBtAaa	I was on birth control too and my husband pulled out also but i still got pregnant so i would make sure he pulls out every single time or try my best to wear a condom every single time|`|bF3DAb1faa	oh Boy, i feel like i'm on Quantum leap.Still  poss of catching an std/baby-look up the brook advisory clinic.|`|DrlDqVZeaa	if you take it right and pull out the chances are slim to none.|`|yU0dp5HDaa	It you are taking it properly then the chances are slim to none. Properly means the same time every day and making sure you are taking it every day. |`|XcBrABWAaa	The pill should be pretty reliable by it's self if you take it correctly.  The same time EVERY day.  |`|64R0q42faa	It's still possible to get pregnant.  The pull-out method is never very effective and even the best birth control medication methods aren't 100%.  You should use a condom if you don't want to get pregnant.  I became pregnant with my daughter while on birth control.  Nothing is full-proof.
rHqkDbZmaa	well they cant say for sure but they can give you an estimate. but that should be the least of you worries, lol!|`|f97b8fda569e8e29554fa9c50704fecbaa	they can get an estimation from an ultrasound but remember its only an estimation.|`|yU0dp5HDaa	Only way to guess is to have an ultrasound. You can know about how long it'll be by our measurements at your appointments but not how much it will weigh. |`|64R0q42faa	Your ob/gyn should be able to make an estimate based on measuring your belly and feeling around during your prenatal exams.  My doc was pretty accurate when I was pregnant with my daughter.  |`|ux6j2OIeaa	They can give you an estimate if you have a late ultrasound. Whatever the size i'm sure you'll be fine, our bodies are made to have babies and normally you wouldn't have one that was too big.  However if your doctor thinks for any reason you are having an extremely big baby or that you may have trouble giving birth they will talk to you about it closer to the birth and make other arrangements for labor.|`|GFLPgtDAaa	They can estimate it.|`|JBzNXFidaa	Huh? You're question makes no sense, but if you're asking how big your baby will be, every baby is different.|`|ksFjbjVraa	Your doctor will be able to give you an estimate.  |`|R9DzBHh9aa	Most OBGYNs do a an ultrasound around 36 weeks to check the baby's weight.  It's not the most accurate measurement.  Usually they are off by a pound, plus or minus.  After 36 weeks, they estimate that the baby gains 1/2 pound a week.|`|RL1Dq6HSaa	my doctor kept telling me all along that my lil boy was going to be a little small but nothing to be worried about. i was even told this the day before i had him. but he was 9lbs 3 oz and 21 inches! WrongO Mr doctor sir!|`|Ux0F7WJJaa	Are you asking if you can find out how much the baby will weigh before you have it?      They can give you an estimate by measuring the baby during an ultrasound. But the estimate is just that, an estimate. Sometimes they induce people early cause they think the baby will be big and then it isn't. It's not fool proof. There's really no way that is 100% accurate except weighing the baby after birth.|`|rdbRGWfzaa	the doctor will usually do an estimate, but it's not completely accurate because it can be plus or minus a pound.  they told me my daughter was going to be 6lbs and 5oz and that day I gave birth to a 7lbs 2oz baby girl|`|2wmuuOHRaa	they try to estimate based on ur stomach measurements and the babies measurments during ultrasounds, but its not always accurate, my son was estimated to be a little over 7 lbs he was 8lb 10 oz!!!! way off! good luck and congratulations|`|Mg1wsl1haa	Babies differ in sizes...doctors can give u an estimate of the baby's size by measuring your uterus hight..etc...but it's not a 100%.
OKN4kGrnaa	i think you got a bad case of the itchy nips i would try and sleep it off.|`|64R0q42faa	It's possible, but the only way to know for sure is a pregnancy test or an exam by a doctor.  If your period is lasting for more than a week and that is abnormal for you, you should schedule an appointment and get checked out whether you could be pregnant or not.|`|MzDTL8jVaa	It takes about 6 weeks before pregnancy symptoms show up.  Maybe you have dry skin.|`|dT0dDuGbaa	That isn't a sign I have heard of and I am kind of a pregnancy sign fanatic.  It is most likely some type of allergy that is making you itch or the fabric or some other irritant.    Missing 2 pills isn't good and could let that little egg out, but it isn't likely and if you have had a period that long I would say it is very doubtful that you are pregnant.  |`|QCUPeW8aaa	The only way to really know for sure is to take a pregnancy test when you are worried about being pregnant your body sometimes play tricks on you and trys to convince you and sometimes it makes you miss your period as we'll  Get a pregnancy test and use early morning urine its more accurate.  Good luck to you   =]|`|Mg1wsl1haa	You can't really decide whether you're pregnant from such symptoms. Best thing is to do a pregnancy test...get one from a pharmacy and good luck!|`|JBzNXFidaa	Take a HPT. There is no way to tell just cos your nipple itches
c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You have to wait because you are NOT pregnant right away.      The test detects the hormones in your bloodstream which are released after the embryo has implanted in the uterus.    Once you have sex the sperm have to travel from the vagina, through the uterus and up the fallopian tubes, hopefully meeting an egg along the way.  If the sperm fertilizes the egg, the little blastocyct travels back down the tube to the uterus where it embeds itself into the wall of the uterus.    After that it will start to secrete the hormone which is detectable by the test.    All this can take several days or weeks, and in fact the sperm and egg may not have met anyway, so pregnancy may not occur.  |`|yU0dp5HDaa	You should wait until your period is due. At least two or three weeks after sex. Still might be inaccurate. You have to wait until your period is late before its accurate.|`|zD27vFE2aa	19 days to a month after. Nothing would show if you took a test straight away.|`|64R0q42faa	After sex?  You need to wait until your period is due or late depending upon whether or not you take an early detection test.  |`|s1vUO8Ypaa	You have to wait a certain number of days after your missed period. Until then, it's too soon to tell. The pregnancy test box will give you the exact number b/c they differ depending upon the test. First response gives you the least amount of days to wait after your missed period. Hope this helps.|`|Mg1wsl1haa	At least a couple of weeks or until you miss your period.|`|07y9D3Yjaa	you have wait a week.|`|ErCJnABBaa	Three weeks after sex, or the day after you've noticed AF is late.|`|KLauSq46aa	You will get the best results after you miss your period for a few days. it takes the hormones awhile to get into your urine, so be patient. good luck|`|MzDTL8jVaa	It's not when you have sex, it's when you ovulate.  You can take a test as soon as 10 days after ovulation, but it's only about 60% accurate at that point.  15 days after ovulation, it's almost 100% accurate.|`|baAWBgXVaa	at least 18 days
GntonLeQaa	If you can easily afford a house, and you have good credit; buy it now because there are some really good deals out there right now between the short sales and foreclosures....buy it while the values and prices are low......|`|4PwARz54aa	well then why wait?|`|be07e2fee48477531cecc4228cb1dfa9aa	Even if you have a stable job that pays well, now is not a great time to buy.    Companies are folding right, left and centre.    Best to wait and see if your stable secure job is quite so stable and secure in 6 months time, when the bank funding the company has collapsed.|`|1kDq44Tjaa	I wouldn't recommend it considering how the market is now.  I guess that it really all depends on how much money you make and how reliable that your job is.  Another thing to consider is whether or not you want to get married someday, because that will be another big expenditure.|`|XJlVU9Wwaa	buying a house is a big step. do u plan to get married? du see urself workin in the same job in 5 years? if yes then do proceed and get a nice villa.|`|MRXWqgFSaa	Yes. Now is the perfect time to buy because the economy is down and housing prices are down. As a father and a provider it is the best thing to do right now for your new family. Whether or not you and your girlfriend stay together, you will have a stable home for your child.  Im not married to my children's father and right after I had our first he went out and bought a house for us. It has been 5 years and we are still here. |`|K0mUwEYuaa	If I were you I would definetly wait.  Plus, once your child gets older they will be excited to get a horse and that will make you even happier! :-) Congrats|`|cgsybi8Naa	that will be great . But If you can afford it then go for it! otherwise no.   -congratulations!!!! :)|`|dvtO0i8oaa	depends on how big your current house is|`|pGhFro5Vaa	Buy, defiantly buy. Just make sure it's big enough.

H88xNew9aa	I was you when I was in school.  It really made me angry because they would pick on me because I wouldn't let them copy from my paper.  Finally, I had had enough.  During a test I knew someone would copy from, I answered the questions TOTALLY wrong.  Then after class, I talked to the teacher and told her what I had done.  I never once was cross or ugly to anyone, but they left me alone.  Then that way, the teacher knew what was going on and could handle it without me "tattling" on them.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Don't brush it off.  But, Don't take it lightly, either.    Since it sounds like, you are an easy target for bullying, I suggest you learn Aikido because, the bullying is only going to escalate.|`|prytRhSxaa	confront a teacher, counselor, or a friend.    if its minor... you could brush it off.    stay focus on what you got to do and who you really are.    good luck|`|jY31JaCeaa	ignore them|`|dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	Being bullied sucks, and I know it's hard to do but and not to let it bother you, know who your friends are and stay by them who cares about other people, they're probably jealous. |`|BRJxjGghaa	Do nothing. trust me it doesnt matter. Go to school everyday and go what you want. Becaues them people will be the welfare bumbs living with there mommys the rest of there lives. I mean if it is effecting you that much Go to the prinical or the guidence consuler and get help for them. But you can be the bigger person anytime and not let it bother you. that will make them pretty upset and maybe leave you alone. But get someone involed like the 2 i told you. I mean telling osmeone is your best bet.|`|f5udtuwBaa	whatever u do dont let the bullies see that it bothers u. laugh along with it. or it could get worse
GGH0HVdvaa	Considering you had sex only two days before your period, you are most likely not pregnant. Honestly, just buy a preg test to make yourself feel better, but a woman cannot have a DPO length of only 2 days.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You could be pregnant.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	If you started your period you're unlikely to be pregnant. If you want to be sure take a test.|`|BRJxjGghaa	I would say No.. Dont scare him. Wait another week take a test. And honey next time be a little more careful. I know it is hard and i am not judging you but just think a little.. Good luck and i hope it works out for the best.|`|Gnnx3799aa	Yes, very good chance of being pregnant. You can get a period while you're pregnant, you know. No, I wouldn't tell him yet. In about 2-3 weeks take a test, more than 1, and if they come out positive then you need to tell him. There's a very high chance of you being pregnant, especially with it being unprotected. And if you turn out not to be, buy some condoms and get on birth control!|`|dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	If you had your period then you're not pregnant.  Periods just jump around all the time like irregular flows and everything are normal, some last longer than others, that's just how it goes. But next time be smarter about sex, protection would definately be a good thing. |`|m2UsYThRaa	a lot of the times, having sex (if you don't have it regularly) can throw off your period or make it act strange. It's probably just all in your mind. But wait about 6 weeks and take a test. If you're going to be sexually active, you need to get put on birth control.|`|0K42KId5aa	Yes you could be pregnant...and sounds like you are. Make sure to buy a prego test and get the result before you tell your b/f   I wish the best for you! Just remember while everyone is "yelling" at you and judging you harshly.....EVERYONE makes mistakes. Both big & small. If you are pregnant you will get through it...your not the first young girl to get pregnant and you won't be the last. I wish you all the luck in the World!!
8w0786yeaa	Stop cursing in front of him first of all.  Teach him it's not appropriate to say those things and if he continues to do it, he gets a time out.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I thought you were a pregnant puerto rican haha|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Well, he obviously learned it from someone- either from you, or maybe he picked it up at daycare or something.  Do you curse around him?  Because if you do, now would be a good time to stop since he's starting to learn to talk.  Try to keep him away from people who curse.  And do not, I repeat do NOT listen to the person who told you to put soap in his mouth!  That is dangerous, especially for a 1-year-old.  A child that young wouldn't understand why you're doing that anyway, not to mention they would probably swallow it!  I would hope that most people would have enough common sense to not put soap in an infant's mouth.|`|AA11229410	This is funny and I would get a video of it and put on the net.      Kids are not born talking like this.  He gets it from???  Does he have some good traits from others around him?  Kid learn how to react to stress from out examples.  Be cool and he will too.      Kids are not pit bulls.  You have to give them a chance in life.  Maybe a better chance than you hand. But it's great that your around man. |`|tSEA42Uraa	Children learn these things from some place. Usually from a constant place, that they are always around. Don't blame it on television. It's either you or older siblings. Stop saying those things and reprimand him hen he does that. (Reprimand does not mean hit. Put him in a time out, one minute for every year he has lived, meaning one minute.)  Tell him when the time-out is done WHY he was reprimanded, and that it will happen again when he acts up. Tell him he will be praised when he doesn't swear, and will be put in time out when he does. Take away toys if he continues to not listen. But he won't listen at all if you keep dropping the s-bomb.|`|NPjF1t28aa	Stop cursing in front of him, tell others to use appropiate language aroundhim and slap his hand and tell him he cant say that word everytime he say it. He's old enough to understand you and its safe to stop him now than later on!!|`|Y7DBhONraa	You shouldn't have cussed in front of him! That's where he learned it! And you shouldn't hit a 1 year old, or any child for that matter.|`|4ec27dca9c261de9c39abd8e0dd218f5aa	Don't give him a huge reaction when he does it. Just say "We don't use those words" and then ignore it. If you make a big deal out of it he is likely to keep saying it for the attention.|`|PuuFMRcFaa	LOL!  I laugh only because or 18 month old would say "stupid F-er" when he got mad.  He was only repeating what he heard his mommy and daddy say so we had to put a quick stop to our potty mouths.  It was a good lesson for all of us.  But first...we had to stop laughing in front of him when he did it, and stop family from laughing as well.  Time out is hard at that age but just try saying sternly, "No, we don't say that word," every time.  The novelty will wear off eventually but you will just have to keep your language under control from here on out too.  Best of luck!!!|`|ocwIcfzPaa	A swearing child is made and not born.     He is hearing it somewhere or other. If it is not from you, or someone else in your household, then you need to be looking a t babysitters and the like.     |`|LBy5liN1aa	Ignore it. Say, "We dont say that, instead we say ohh shooot!" and give him a different word to say. If you show him that it bothers you, then it will make him do it more. Don't give him the negative attention, thats what he wants.You know how like when a baby says, "uhhh ohh" and you repeat him and say uhhhohhh and then he smiles and says it again? kinda like that.|`|a937d2a07b4e33ee20c61ba4864ad6ffaa	quit swearing, i mean who else did he learn it from?|`|dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	When he says it you should scold him and say " no no that's a naughty word" or something along those lines, maybe tap him on the mouth and if he continues to say it then wash his moth out with soap or put some hot sauce on his tongue everytime he says it, |`|qBTBYjvDaa	you need to pull his pants down pull him over your knee and tell him what he did wrong.tell him not to curse.then tell him your not doing this out of anger but out of love.then raise your hand and hell have no fury like a mother taking her anger out on her child.just kidding spank your child but not too hard remember hes still 1 and he may be incapable of understanding whats going on.hes at a phase where he thinks whatever grownups like mommy do is right.so instructions on spanking.might as well tell you since you asked.spank each cheek twice then rub his bottom between each two and do it over until 8 strokes after he starts crying at that point he has learned what he has done wrong.then lift him off your knee hold him in your arms rub his back(!!!!!DO NOT RUB HIS BOTTOM EXTREMELY SORE AND CHILD MAY START CRYING OVER AGAIN!!!!!!) and tell him over and over again what you did was out of love and you love him more than anything in the world.eventually he'll keep crying and tell you he's sorry and "i wuv u mommy" and everything will be right in the world|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	bar of soap + mouth = no more cursing    It's not going to hurt the child in any way and it is not child cruelty or endangerment.
Gnnx3799aa	No, I would leave the 'boyfriend'. Plus, he's not even a father to any of her children!  I would, personally, leave that family and go stand with an aunt, well-known friend, grandma, etc. I wouldn't want my child to be as dysfunctional as your mom and her boyfriend are.    P.S. I'm so sorry you were raped.|`|nOLNYsftaa	Personally, I think your mother should be standing by you and in her shoes I would tell the boyfriend to go.  I would be devastated to see my daughter making same mistakes as me and would want to support her so that she didn't need  to rely on unsuitable men who would get her pregnant and move on.  History shouldn't repeat itself.    My heart goes out to you being so young and having to deal with all this and possibly alone.    Given all your circumstances it may be better that you are as far away from their influence and able to make a fresh start with you baby.|`|bQu4A2awaa	NO! its not right. how can she even think of doing that? she's your MOTHER she gave birth to you and she cant just kick you out and make you go live out on the streets. you have been in her life longer and she should think about you and not her stupid bf. if i were her and your moms bf were to tell me that your leaving. i would have gone with you.   does she not know how hard it is for a single teenage mother nowadays?     i feel awful for you hunn  xoxo good luck |`|4cprznZcaa	i would never EVER under any circumstance kick my 16 year old child out, especially if she were pregnant. i would be very upset but i would never put her out. im so sorry that you are going through this, my mom is remarried and i lived with her off and on because her husband hated me, once we got into an argument because i asked my mom to take me to work on a saturday and he said that she couldnt take me unless i gave her gas money. i had a job and took care of myself they didnt buy me anything, but i didnt have any extra money to give her, we got in a huge fight and he told her that either i had to leave or he was and she told me to pack my stuff. i hated her for the longest time, but we are finally starting to build a better realtionship. i cant believe any mother would put a man over her child.   your mom is irresponsible and has her priorities in the wrong place. i really hope for the best for you, is there somewhere else you can stay, a grandparents or your fathers? just know that you are going to be a better mother than her. if you can find a better place dont allow her to see her grandchild, she'll really regret it later, especially when he loser boyfriend leaves her. i wish there was something that i could do to help, keep your head up and continue your education for the sake of your child.|`|ZPPLvHDaaa	Absolutley not!  You don't listen to your boyfriend!  That will hurt you daughter will be so hurt, and you'll push her away forever.  I wouldn't tell her to hit the road.  It isnt your boyfriends choice either.  Hes the one who needs to hit the road and stop telling you how to parent your children!    EDIT:  Sorry thought you were the mother, print all of these out and show your mom.|`|dc2a4d97feeb4ccf03ea5438ec4df481aa	Kids should always come before a boyfriend. It was probably really hard for your daughter to come and tell you, and she needs your support, obviously you're not going to be happy about it, but help her out she doesn'y know how to raise a baby give her guidance and support her in all her decisions go with her to doctore appointments and kick your boyfriend to the curb.|`|AjL9kZu2aa	No that's right, and I'm sorry you're going through this.  Would your mom talk to a counselor with you that could help you through this?  Her boyfriend is not a very supportive man, sounds a bit controlling, and has your mom right in the place he wants her to be.  Yes, you are young and it's not going to be easy.  But if you want to keep this baby, you need to do what is best for you and the baby.  Is your boyfriend/babies father together?  What does he think?  What does his parents think?|`|cfb028f514aae85805b490348503ba5baa	Well....Your children should come before any boyfriend.    If he isn't their father, he doesn't really have a say.    Remember how hard being a mom was?  Now take away your age, income...and imagine it, and then take away the support of people close to you.    Do you want to do that to your daughter?  Of course not.  You don't have to be pleased that she's pregnant, but she is, and its going to be hard, so you support her in any way you can.  Throw her a baby shower.    Tell her this. Tell her that her children are supposed to come before boyfriends, that you're her child, and you need her right now.    I am so sorry you poor thing for everything you have gone through.  I am so proud of you for not getting an abortion.|`|L0LOGNH9aa	if their about to break up because of it...maybe rent an apartment or something so that they don't ahve to boether fighting about it. your mom doesn't want you to go, but you wnat your mom to be able to stay in this guys life, right????|`|ZbnJzb2raa	u were raped  its not ur fault   if they dont care anymore  find someone who does    u don't need them.    i hope everything works out   good luck :)|`|LzGNnk4qaa	This is so sad to me I can't even begin to tell you. I don't know what it would have been like to not have my family there when I had my son. I really think that your mother will turn around. When I got pregnant i was young too. Not as young as you I was 20. But I had only known my bf @ the time for three months. My moms reaction was have an abort on. Now she regrets ever saying that because she loves my son. She has told me she was sorry many of times. It sounds like your whole family is under stress. You could give the child up for adopton. Their are many families out there that would love to have a baby and can't. I know that would be a very hard thing to do. Myself I would never be able to do it. However it is a very nice thing to do and it would make someone very happy. If you choose to keep your baby, give it sometime. Stay out of the way and just kind of let your family do their own thing. I think they will come around in the end! Good luck sweetie. Also you can check Craig's List for people giving away baby items. Where I live they always have tons of baby stuff in the free section. I went to garage sales and got everything I needed. It was all cheap and nice. Most 1st time mothers buy the best of everything and hardly use it. Then they don't know what to do with it so they are usually looking to give it away or sell it very cheap! Just keep your head up things will get better!|`|iT5vnplHaa	ur mom's boyfriend is a loser. how the hell is it ur fault for getting pregnant if u were raped. its not ur fault. just when ur mom isnt around her bf tell her to sit and talk with u and tell her hees a fag. i dont think that any mom would tell their kid to leave like that. plus the person who raped u would have to pay for everything anyway i think

Also, since your last name could be interpreted as a verb, perhaps its best to stay away from middle names that could be interpreted as helping verbs.

Qm4BKE13aa	No. It isn't wrong at all. You should choose the people who you trust and can picture them raising your child how you would, have the same values as you, someone kind of like you in the sense that they have even a small amount of your spirit.   If they both pass if you are still living you will have to find others you trust to be there guardian. If you are gone then who was the guardian of the child(ren) will have a guardian in their will.|`|ae4ecca9b319e1194dce1771566de4b5aa	When we had our daughter, we never chose god parents and do not plan too.|`|WpbVmZddaa	Family is tricky business. Instead of picking just one God parent, why not select a few?       How did she raise your partner? Sometimes the most annoying people raise great kids. It doesn't matter who you do and don't like, if she did a good job of raising her children, she would do the same for your child, because afterall, she may not like you, but that child will be her grandchild, her own flesh and blood.|`|UfrUnzkEaa	My children have godparents.  But you pick in a will who will be guardians to your children, at least here in the U.S.  You get $5000 for having a child? I didn't know that.|`|YX1NeQJyaa	When choosing godparents you should choose someone that is most like you and your SO. It would make for a smoother transition during a difficult time. My husband and I have choosen but haven't put it in legal writing. We've chosen his best friend and one of my friends depending on who would be able. In all likeliness though, one of our parents would end up taking care of our kids.|`|iYNONWGMaa	I always understood godparents to be people outside the family, an independent person your child can turn to for advice or to seek refuge from when things are tough at home. There can be lots of responsibilities, depending on how seriously to take the position and whether they take an oath in a religious ceremony. But, I agree with the earlier poster who says that godparenthood doesn't legally make them next-of-kin unless you stipulate so in a will.    Why don't you make the elder sister the godmother and let your child's grandparents be his grandparents? Or you could pick a close friend?    It's great to hear that Australia gives you child money. Germany, like much of Europe, also gives you child support money regardless of income or assets. We get 150/month until the child is 18. It's pretty great. It's unheard of here for people to delay having kids because "they can't afford it". You're ready when you're ready, and money isn't the issue.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	relax, have fun, and focus less on the future family.  this is your time, so enjoy it.

dKq7DZkbaa	LOL at Glenna!!!!  When a friend of mine was about 26 weeks along her little girl was doing the same thing, and she really did pee herself. It was so funny because she actually went to the hospital thinking her water broke. They just told her it was the babies doing and to go home!    Don't worry in about another 2 months the baby will be turned around and doing the same thing to your ribs, which is SO much worse!      If he is moving alot it just means that  he is healthy and active. It is a really good thing. If he was still the majority of the day, then you should worry.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Yes, my daughter did the same thing about that time. It is quite painful. There must be a nerve there or something.

JXJHDMEmaa	As soon as your normal bra starts to feel uncomfortable you should start wearing a maternity bra. Wearing a well-designed maternity bra is the best way to support your breasts.   When you're shopping for a maternity bra look for the following:       Support: look for wide straps, sides, under-bust band and a deep centre at the front. Firm elastic straps eliminate bounce and give you extra support.     Coverage: you need as much fabric as possible over the breast area; this will be more comfortable for you as your breasts become more sensitive.     Adjustability: a minimum of four rows of back eyes will allow your bra to grow with you.     Comfort: look for bras that are mainly cotton; many women find that they get hot while pregnant; cotton lets your skin breathe so you are less likely to sweat.     Try the site for excellent maternity & nursing bras   www.breast-feeding-bras.co.uk|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Don't allow pressure.|`|ae4ecca9b319e1194dce1771566de4b5aa	I would buy yourself maternity/nursing bras when your current bra either starts leaving red marks or becomes uncomfortable.  There are some bras available that "grow" with you.  If you are planning on nursing your child, then the bras would not be a waste of money as you would be using them until they wean.      As far as how many bras you need, that depends on how many bra you will use and how often you do laundry.  For the beginning, I would recommend at least 2 (one to wear and one to wash).    Motherhood Maternity has some great bras for about $13.00.  |`|DPXSLtecaa	I am 29 weeks and I have only brought a "sports-bra" type nursing bra to sleep in.  I bought that when I was about 12 weeks along.  I know that I am going to need to buy some real nursing bras pretty soon but my breasts haven't gotten any bigger yet.  I've heard that if you sleep in the "sports-bra" type bra that it helps relieve some of the stretch marks around your breasts but for me, it helps them not hurt so bad.  i think you should have three or four bras total by the end.  you should have one you can wear, one in the drawer, and one in the laundry.  at least that is what i've been told so i guess it just depends on if you plan on nursing or just getting maternity bras....|`|AA11436843	until you start breastfeeding, a good well fitting supportive bra will do. Get measured by a specialist when ever you're growing out of your bras too.  You can get good supportive bras quite cheaply. When I say supportive I mean the ones - if you wear wonderbras and suchlike - that you wouldnt normally be seen dead in....lol  full cup, good wide supportive straps, yes - sounds like something your gran would wear, but in the long run, for comfort, and to stop too much sagging, they'll be worth it.  A couple should do you, or if you have the means to dry quickly, I used to wash mine out last thing at night and it was dry by next day, you could even get away with the one then.  Hope all goes well for you good luck xx|`|9DKNSq9daa	As soon as you grow out of your bra's you are wearing now. My breast grew at a very fast rate in the beginning. Buy as many as you like, i found M & S the best place to buy them as they are slightly cheaper then anywhere else. Or just wear non under wired bra's is also the same. Also buy something to wear a night as you will need support then.  Your breast will grow at different rates throughout your pregnancy and then again once your milk comes through after baby is born. What us poor women have to go through hey!! Congratulations.

If you are having sex with your partner, and there's no risk of STD'S you don't need protection.

HiXZsAYAaa	I too prefer c-section. Mainly because I've been told that if I were to try natural birth, that I may end up dislocating my hips or damaging my pelvis. My body simply was not made for natural birth. Not to mention the fact that a lot of men SWEAR that sex after a natural birth just isn't the same. I don't know, that could be their weird little imaginations though. lol|`|YP4jXZg9aa	Natural birth for sure! A C-section is not the way to go.

My one friend could not even hold her baby for a week because of the pain, she ended up not being able to breast feed.|`|UqOJvRuwaa	I haven't given birth personally so I can only give my opinion based on what I've heard.    My mom has tried both and natural will be painful although you can get really strong pain killers given to you, but you may be so doped out you won't be able to clearly remember the first time you saw your child. Some people claim that natural means your bond with the child is stronger but *shrugs*  For C-section my mom says she didn't feel any pain but she could feel what was going on...(which freaks me out) and that when they were busy removing the child it felt like someone digging around in drawers...  They both comes with risks, advantages and disadvantages so make sure you know about both and decide which suits your needs best!  Hope I've helped ^^ |`|XhmwNtb2aa	Natural... i definitely dont want the scar from a C section... and the healing time is longer.. and they can cut through the muscles making it difficult to get your tummy back to normal.. if at all without surgery...

With natural, it is exciting and you heal much more quickly, but it is usually a much longer process.  With a C-section, you get to plan when you do it and the process is much more quickly and you get to see your baby sooner.  However, it is surgery, so you take longer to heal.  It's a personal choice, so you have to decide what you will want vs. need.|`|Y5MJIfJPaa	I would say natural is the best way i had my baby that way and would be devastated if i had to have c-section it is a major operation with long healing time.Vaginally you have less healing i was home 4 hours after and that was my first baby it hurt like hell but was over as soon as i had him and your in pain for weeks after with c-section|`|QRBj7YISaa	Go epy, and this way you do not have to have any extra recovery time!!!!|`|aLAO8Fmyaa	i've not had a baby but i would go natural and see how it feels   good luck   xxx|`|zQWNb6neaa	I have delivered two children naturally (well, vaginally) and I have had three abdominal surgeries- one incision is the exact same as a bikini c-section. I would prefer having a vaginal birth over a surgical one any day. The recovery after surgery is much longer than after a vaginal, uncomplicated delivery. Also, the risks are considerably less. In the end though, if a C-section is required out of medical necessity then that is what needs to be done. The 'best' birth is the one that ends with a healthy baby and mom. |`|Bw1h5xAcaa	I prefer MEDICAL reasons over esthetic ones, considering MEDICAL reasons can lead to complications that result in additional illness. A vaginal birth should always be the first choice for birth unless other conditions make it more risky than a c-section (such as breech baby, placenta previa, emergency conditions resulting in severe fetal distress, etc.)    Just because c-sections are performed with such great number does not mean they are as good as or safe as a vaginal birth. Women who think they would prefer a section are most likely not educated properly in all the risks.    If anyone here ever saw a woman with a postpartum c-section infection of the incision, a hematoma that requires draining, sepsis (infection in the blood stream), so sick that they are almost dying, rehospitalized after going home and now separated from their infant, you'd think twice about your options.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I prefer Natural birth cause its better for the baby and its a great experience|`|x6IyESABaa	I prefer natural But have to go on c-section due to my low placenta. Sobs. I really want to feel how natural it's like.     I'm 16 weeks pregnant. You can view my pregnancy blog at:  http://joanna-shawn.blogspot.com/|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Sex after a c-section is definitely preferable to a vaginal delivery.  It doesn't hurt if lubricated enough.  However, the minute someone touches the vj, even with lots of lubricant, it's gonna hurt.    In the US, vaginal deliveries are usually helped along, esp if the mom begins to tear, with an episiotomy.  But the episiotomy is only one cut and baby's out.  You'd be sore for weeks afterward.  Not to mention the hemorrhoids you get from pushing.  No hemorrhoids for c-section moms.    C-section is major surgery.  The dr. has to cut a lot of abdominal muscles to get baby out.  It takes longer to recover, and you'll not be 100% for quite some time.  Drs. argue that vaginal birth moms heal faster.      As you can probably tell, my kids were delivered c-section.  I thought it was great, very easy, and would do it again anytime.  Consider, though, that I heal rapidly from any surgery, and am up on my feet before you know it.    TX Mom  |`|sIQzny5Taa	I prefer natural birth because A) I'm extremely afraid of needles especially a huge *** needle in my back B) I'm afraid of surgery and undergoing anesthesia because I'm afraid I won't wake up C) I want to actually feel everything, I don't wanna take the easy way out. But I don't judge anyone who wants anything different than me. 
yEwxr66laa	Don't worry its only natural for a girl of her age to be curious about these things.

"Walnuts have often been thought of as a "brain food," not only because of the wrinkled brain-like appearance of their shells, but because of their high concentration of omega-3 fats. Your brain is more than 60% structural fat. For your brain cells to function properly, this structural fat needs to be primarily the omega-3 fats found in walnuts, flaxseed and cold-water fish. This is because the membranes of all our cells, including our brain cells or neurons, are primarily composed of fats. Cell membranes are the gatekeepers of the cell. Anything that wants to get into or out of a cell must pass through the cell's outer membrane. And omega-3 fats, which are especially fluid and flexible, make this process a whole lot easier, thus maximizing the cell's ability to usher in nutrients while eliminating wastes--definitely a good idea, especially when the cell in question is in your brain. "    It's clearly just coincidental, though.  Fish are good for your brain, too, but they don't look much like brains.|`|AA10943329	Yes, that is true.

c30c029b276b8310236ff7e508ec1772aa	Ich wrde so ein Mittelma? suchen. Es ist schon wichtig, wenn Kinder lernen sich allein zu besch?ftigen bzw. mit Geschwistern oder Freunden.    Aber zwischendurch sollte man auch mitspielen, vor allem, wenn es ein Einzelkind ist. Wenn das Kind immer nur allein rumhockt, ist es fr ihn/sie ja auch langweilig.    Es kommt auch, denke ich, immer ganz auf das Alter an. Kleinere Kinder haben es sicher gern, wenn Mama oder Papa noch mitspielen. Ab nem bestimmten Alter wollen sie das dann gar nicht mehr.    Mir macht es auf jeden Fall immer Riesenspa?, wenn ich mit meinem Junior bei seinen Playmobil Spielchen mitspielen darf.|`|f4064c152cc8b087703c4012daee0869aa	ein Kind braucht auch mal langweile, denn dann wird es kreativ und sucht selbst sich Unterhaltung ,natrlich nicht fernsehen .  die Erfahrung hab ich selbst gemacht ,sch?ner ist zusammen aber das kann man ja  absprechen|`|e0729d54277a2b9a964d5c4fa9633d4faa	Ich finde auch das Kinder beides kennenlernen sollten!

Lg steffi|`|4ab62245d73a5256bb924267f4e9a4b7aa	Ich finde da sollte ein ausgewogenes Gleichgewicht herrschen.    Jedes Kind sollte von Anfang an lernen, sich auch mal allein besch?ftigen zu k?nnen. Deshalb sollte ja auch die liebe Mama nicht immer gleich bei jedem kleien Jammern und Winzeln losrennen.    Es ist aber auch wichtig, dass Eltern sich mit ihren Kindern besch?ftigen. Sie sollen ja schlie?lich auch wissen, dass sie den Eltern nicht egal sind. Ausserdem lernen sie ja auch besser und mehr, wenn Mama und Pape ihnen verschiedene Dinge zeigen und erkl?ren.    Das das nicht immer ganz einfach ist, wei? ich selbst. Mein Junior (8 1/2 Monate) ist zur Zeit ganz sehr anh?nglich. Vor allem bei Mama. Er muss aber trotzdem mal ne viertel Stunde oder so im Laufgitter bleiben.  Er schreit ja deswegen nicht die ganze Welt zusammen.    Er knietscht und quengelt halt dann nur, weil es nicht ganz nach seinem kopf l?uft. Da muss er aber auch mal durch. Der Haushalt macht sich ja schlie?lich auch nicht von allein.  Am glcklichsten ist er, wenn er durch die ganze Wohnung krabbeln kann, aber wenn ich die W?sche runter h?nge, geht das nun mal nicht.  Wer wei?, was dieser kleine neugierige Schlaumeier anstellt, wenn er allein ist. Man muss das Unglck ja nicht unbeding herauf beschw?ren.

Je jnger sie sind, um so mehr sollte man mitspielen und vor allem pres?nt sein. Recht kleine Kinder lassen sich schnell entmutigen, wenn etwas nicht gleich funktioniert und wissen nicht gleich mit ihrem Unmut wohin. Da sollte man auf alle F?lle rechtzeitig eingreifen, bevor der Spa? am Spielen verloren geht.    Mein Sohn ist z.B. 4 Jahre. Er mag es nicht besonders allein zu spielen. Wenn es nach ihm ginge, wrder er nur Spielen, wenn ich oder mein Mann mitmachen, aber das find ich auch nicht ok. Er gibt Momente, da verlange ich auch mal, dass er sich allein besch?ftigt, genauso gibt es aber auch wieder Phasen, in denen wir gemeinsam ein Spiel hervorholen oder gemeinsam basteln.    Sein Freund (auch 4) will nur allein - der bekommt schon einen Tobsuchtsanfall, wenn seine Eltern das Spielzeug nur angreifen und mitmachen wollen.

VLG|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Ich wrde sagen, dass es am besten ist, wenn Kinder viel alleine spielen, also mit anderen Kindern alleine, nicht ganz alleine. Abundzu sollte man aber auch mitspielen.|`|745e071977fc4e52b66b36535fdf7b80aa	Ich halte beides fr wichtig!  Kinder sollen lernen miteinander zu spielen, was ja auch nicht unbedingt einfach ist! Wie z.B. wenn es um Spiele geht, bei denen man auch verlieren kann. Je frher sie lernen, dass das 'Verlieren' gar nicht so schlimm ist, desto besser kommen sie im sp?teren Leben (Kindergarten/Schule/Job) klar!    Aber auch das 'alleine spielen' ist wichtig, denn jeder Mensch sollte sich auch mal mit sich selbst besch?ftigen k?nnen. Wenn das beim Kleinkind durchs Spielen geschieht, ist es auf jedenfall besser, als wenn aus Langeweile die 'Glotze' angemacht wird.  Kinder, die schon frh alleine spielen gelernt haben, werden sp?ter auch mal ein Buch lesen, anstatt mit dem Playboy zu spielen.|`|64da4f34022969d37c1db92eb04690e3aa	In der Gesellschaft ist es doch besser oder?|`|f98b3066129446083a32dce922dd4488aa	Ich find es sch?n wenn man 2 mal die Woche mit den Kids zusammen einen Spiele abend macht -mit Mutti,Vati,Geschwisterchen(?)-  memory,Puzzle,Puppen,Autos oder so...|`|c5c67ee94ad1823b39d795ad8ce40a33aa	das kommt sehr auf das jeweilige kind an und ob du ein einzelkind hast, oder ob geschwister zum mitspielen da sind.  ich denke kinder sollten beides lernen, mal alleine zu spielen ,aber auch mit der familie.  sie mssen alledings akzeptieren,das man als mutter oder vater nicht immer zeit zum spielen hat.  ein gesundes mittelma? ist da ok.  ansonsten genie? die zeit,solang sie noch in dem alter sind dich mitspielen zu lassen,die geht schneller rum als man manchmal denkt!

Sp?testens, wenn Du mal berufst?tig bist, merkst Du leider auf Deine Kosten, das Du nicht alles machen kannst.  So wie, zu sp?t kommen ;))  So, wie in der S-Bahn schwarz fahren (wird teuer).  So, wie mit 180 Sachen durch eine Wohngegend fahren  Huch, ich komme mir jetzt vor, wie der Weise vom Berg!!|`|5daaec663ba4660308cb663cf60f762faa	Mit h?herer Entwicklung wird auch immer ein gr??erer Freiheitsgrad erreicht. Aber mehr Freiheit bedeutet nichts anderes als mehr Verantwortung! Da man als junger Mensch die Folgen und Tragweiten seiner Handlungen nicht immer berblickt und realistisch absch?tzen kann, muss die Handlungsfreiheit bis zum Erreichen gr??erer Reife noch etwas eingeschr?nkt werden. Man kann einem Kind nicht die volle Verantwortung fr seine Handlungen aufbrden! Das ist zwar fr den Betroffenen oft schwer nachzuvollziehen (ging mir frher genauso), aber glaube mir, es geschieht nur zu Deinem Schutz und Deinem Besten.|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Du sollst ja Erfahrungen machen. Aber du sollst auch wissen, dass es nicht gut ist was du machst. Wenn du zB jeden Abend feiern gehen wrdest und kein Zeitlimit h?ttest. Dann wrdest du es nicht mehr sch?tzen es "trotzdem" zu machen und wrdest vielleicht irgendwann darauf abkacken und nur noch feiern und Alki werden , Drogenkarriere anfangen etc.  Anderes Beispiel Beziehung: Deine Eltern wollen dich schtzen, damit du nicht Schwanger wirst oder dir irgendwelche Krankheiten holst. Dadurch dass sie es dir verbieten, k?nnen sie nicht verhindern, dass du dich dennoch mit Jungen triffst. Sie bewirken aber, dass du dich vielmehr damit besch?ftigst und vorsichtiger bist.   Oder Freunde verbieten: Sie wollen dich vor schlechtem EInfluss schtzen, so kannst du nichts machen, was du sp?ter mal bereuen wirst. In wirklichkeit geht das natrlich nicht. Aber eigentlich wollen sie nur das Beste fr dich. Und bedenke immer. Es ist verdammt schwer ein Kind richtig aufwachseb zu lassen. Eigentlich kann man es nur falsch machen. Und dafr machen deine Eltern doch bestimmt einen fantastischen Job ;-)|`|a4c989fc6e2f97d8c376d970e331c25daa	hallo saja,  mal grunds?tzlich, mssen musst du gar nix und drfen darfst du alles, was du selbst verantworten kannst.

Zeigt es denn nicht, dass du erwachsen wirst oder erwachsener handelst, wenn du dich an gewisse Regeln und Grunds?tze halten musst?  Stell dir mal vor du h?lst dich nicht an die Verkehrsregeln...oder keiner wrde sich dranhalten, weil jeder sich sagt, "den Fhrerschein habe ich freiwillig gemacht, also darf ich auch fahren, wie ich will" ...was fr ein Chaos das w?re!!!

Aber das kommt weil ich nicht sicher bin, wie weit die Beiden sich schon selber einsch?tzen k?nnen.    Mein Tipp: Red mal ruhig mit Deinen Eltern drber. Erkl?re Ihnen, warum Du das was Du willst Deiner Meinung nach schon machen kannst.  Das hilft bei uns auch oft - so manches Mal habe ich meine Meinung revidiert und es doch erlaubt.     Nur manchmal ;) DA habe ich mich durchgesetzt - da ging mir die Sicherheit der Kids vor, smile....

Sie wollen, dass Du nur Gutes erf?hrst. Klar ist das falsch, denn schlechte Erfahrungen geh?ren dazu. versuche mit Deinen Eltern die goldene Mitte zu finden.  Zeige ihnen dass sie Dir vertauen k?nnen, dann wird es ihnen leichter fallen loszulassen!|`|8c6c048c221fce9c5a9c174035a414f1aa	Hi ich bin 16, ich wei? nicht wie alt du bist, aber ich denke, wenn man Teenager ist, muss man doch Grenzen gesetzt bekommen, damit man im Leben klar kommt. Es gibt verschiedene Eltern, also auch verschiedne Erzihungen, und das hei?t auch verschieden starke Grenzen. Meine Freundin z.B. darf gar nichts. Sie wird manchmal zur Schzle gebracht, damit sie sich nciht mit ihrem Freund treffen kann und ihre Eltern fahren 2-3 mal an der Tanzschule vorbei um zu schauen, ob ihr Freund da ist. Meine Mutter bzw. auch mein Vater sind total locker. Sie leben eher neben mr her und zeigen mir den richtigen Weg. Sie setzen mir zwar auch Grenzen, wenn ihnen wirklich etwas nicht passt, aber meistens lassen sie mich machen... Das ist wirklich von Familie zu Familie verschieden und man kann denk ich auch nciht wirklich etwas dagegen machen!!! Man uss sich damit einfach abfinden und ab 18 darfst du ja eh selbst entscheiden!!! Also viel Glck ;)|`|3032567dbbd92373a371ecdce227979daa	Ich wei? nicht wie alt du bist und was genau du damit meinst: in Watte gepackt zu werden.  Manchmal ist es so, dass die Sorge der Eltern und die Angst, dass dir etwas passieren k?nnte, dazu fhrt, das Kind zu schtzen.  Sie k?nnen dann nicht erkennen, dass sie ihrem Kind trauen, bzw. mehr zutrauen k?nnen.  Rede mit deinen Eltern, nur so k?nnen sie dich auch verstehen.|`|666affc4dc999e3ec531bd59d3a0e09eaa	weil man davon ausgeht das ein 10jege keinen plan hat von das was sie macht und deswegen darf man nciht alles auserdem hast du sp?ter auch noch genug zeit alles auszuprobieren|`|eb6b1b34b4d5d127b7734be7676514b4aa	Es gibt reichlich "Erfahrungen" im Leben, die muss man nicht unbedingt selber machen. 8-)    Umso ?lter man wird, umso mehr h?rt man von den Erfahrungen anderer und kann sich dann vielleicht viele eigene schlechte Erfahrungen sparen. Darauf hoffen eigentlich alle Eltern, man m?chte seine Kinder beschtzen und vermeiden, dass sie auf irgendeine Weise Kummer haben.    Mit jedem Lebensjahr des Kindes steigt die soziale Kompetenz, Umsichtigkeit, Einsicht, es berschaut immer mehr die Konsequenzen seiner Handlungen.    Was einem Kind im Moment total logisch und sinnvoll erscheint, findet es in einem Jahr vielleicht total abwegig. So sehen Eltern ihre Kinder aufwachsen und man kann schlecht einsch?tzen, wann das aufh?rt. Das macht Eltern Angst 8-)    Versuch ihnen zu zeigen, dass du aus diesem Alter heraus bist, dass man sich auf dich verlassen kann, dass du Vereinbarungen auf jeden Fall einh?lst, dass du zuverl?ssig bist, dass du logisch denken kannst. Das nimmt deinen Eltern etwas die Angst und sie k?nnen lockerer werden. Und versuch etwas Verst?ndnis aufzubringen - Eltern sind auch nur Menschen! 8-)|`|70b0bb85fdac19f3e6e43413be2cbff3aa	das kenne ich. wenn du irgendwie mal sp?ter nach hause kommen willst und bei deinem freund bist, dann gleich der spruch:nein, du bist ein m?dchen und du kommst frher nach hause. auf m?dchen muss man mehr aufpassen". das nervt mich auch total. na gut, es gibt naive m?dels, die lassen dann auch alles mit sich machen. aber mal ehrlich, eigentlich wei? man doch was man tut und kann doch auch mal l?nger wegbleiben. man muss ja nicht allein weggehen. aber dieses berbehtete nervt mich auch. ich muss eigene erfahrungen machen, um daraus zu lernen, die kann man mir nicht abnehmen. das geht nunmal nicht. irgendwann muss ich ja mal allein zurechtkommen k?nnen|`|be9d250684c0b3ed2761c8500fd7ba1caa	Sei froh, dass du nicht alles darfst! Ich bin jetzt 18 Jahre alt und habe, trotzdem ich kein M?dchen bin vieles verboten gekriegt in den letzten Jahre, was jetzt vorbei ist. Im nachhinein ist das ein sch?nes Gefhl, auch wenn es ?fters zu riesen Streits kommt, das man etwas behtet wurde und nicht alles alleine bew?ltigen musste.  Beispiel?  Einmal (mit 14) wollte ich nach Berlin mit einem Kumpel auf eine Demo. Meine Eltern wollten es mir strikt verbieten und ich habe das damals berhaupt nicht verstanden. Naja, sie haben mich ziehen lassen, als klar war, dass mein Onkel, der in Berlin wohnt, Zeit hatte, um sich mit mir zu treffen und mir weiterzuhelfen, falls was passiert.  Klingt ja erstmal auch sehr verst?ndlich oder? Als ich dann in Berlin war, hat es mich einfach umgehauen, wie riesig die Stadt war und ich habe mich null zurecht gefunden. Auf der Demo waren dann 600.000 Leute, also eine Riesenmenge und ich war froh, einen Onkel zu haben, der mich ein wenig leiten konnte.  Was ich damit sagen will, ist, das man in einem bestimmten Alter die Dinge nicht so einfach einsch?tzen kann, wie man denkt. Man ist nunmal naiv. Und ich habe trotzdem daraus gelernt. Wenn du mehr Freiheiten willst, ist es, denke ich entscheidend, dass du reif dazu bist. Also, zeige deinen Eltern im Alltag, dass du reif bist, dass du Verantwortung bernehmen kannst, und sie werden verstehen, dass sie dich loslassen mssen und dir mehr Freiheiten eingestehen. Wenn dem nicht so ist, dann verstehe ich deine Eltern leider auch nicht.  Viel Glck!

If this happened last night then you have time to go to your doctor or a pharmacist for the morning after pill..effective for up to 72 hours after the event, and I think that you should do this.

But even if you ovulated the next day, 25% is the normal monthly chance. Please be careful next time.

Vielleicht noch ein wenig fr eine Frau die noch nie ein Kind geboren hat... sie wei? noch icht wie es sich anfhlt den ersten Schrei des Babys zu h?ren und den kleinen K?rper auf dem Arm zu haben. Sie hat noch nie ihr Kind betrachtet und das Grbchen am Kinn bewundert (wie der Papa) und die kleine Stupsnase (hat er/sie von der Mama) betrachtet.   Wenn ein weiteres Kind nicht mehr in meine Lebensplanung passt, sorge ich dafr das keines mehr entsteht! Und wenn es dann doch passiert und ich wirklich nicht wei? wie ich es durchbringen soll, wrde ich es austragen und es dann zur Adoption freigeben! So ein kleiner Wurm hat eine Chance verdient... zur Not halt bei anderen Eltern wo es geliebt und gut versorgt wird!|`|37d76b69667412e20ea70cc908d6d9b5aa	ich bin im moment mit meinem 4ten kind schwanger. fr mich w?re es niemals in frage gekommen, abzutreiben.     abtreibung ist in meinen augen mord. auch wenn andere (nachbarn und vor allem die tolle verwandtschaft) mir nahe legten, das baby weg machen zu lassen.|`|9d893b518f3c89b4f126b6d34c64f8cdaa	Das ist Mord und ich glaube auch nicht, dass diejenige jemals wieder glcklich werden wird.|`|999b20ff9275cf8b078cf5e1afd395b8aa	also abtreibung is ja wirklich das allerletzte! wenn man keine kinder (mehr) will, kann man ja verhten oder hat deine bekannte noch nie was von verhtungsmitteln geh?rt? oder halt deine art (sterilisation) is hilfreich, aber abtreibung sollte verboten werden. wenn die menschheit glaubt, sie k?nnte gedankenlos rumv... ohne konsequenzen, dann hat sie sich geschnitten. und wenn man nicht bereit ist, diese konsequenzen zu tragen, sollte man vorsorgen, entweder durch sterilisation oder verhtung, aber nicht im nachhinein sich des "problems entledigen". sorry, wenn das jetzt etwas krass klang, aber zum thema abtreibung kann ich nur so viel sagen: NEVER!|`|dfb00991c5de3c92ceb73fcce0bc9f97aa	wie w?re es mit Sterilisation, dann braucht man keinen Mord begehen, denn Abtreibung ist Mord, finde ich. ein Kind sagt nicht ich will auf die Welt kommen.|`|99eb17e489bbe074cb36378f8925dbefaa	das ist ganz alleine sache der schwangeren und nur ihre. keiner sollte darber richten. vor allem keine m?nner und kinderlose|`|de8b7d71ff0a0e1e896c6bd7556dda06aa	Bin gegen Abtreibung! Wrde ber die Dame nie urteilen geschweige den verurteilen .Es alleine Ihre Entscheidung und Sie hat es mit 4 Kindern sicher nicht einfach|`|b63b980000d769a4e51a86c529e763c9aa	Abtreiben, nein, es gibt heute so viele M?glichkeiten zu verhten, wenn es dennoch passiert, sollte man dazu stehen, das Kind hat ein Recht auf Leben.|`|d9327bf6840c5b79000fb4267f8fd34caa	Vorher nachdenken, es gibt schlie?lich genug Methoden, um zu verhten!!!|`|83cf1e02eb7efda61d83c2f51ab52b6eaa	also ich denke, entweder man verhttet ordendlich oder muss sich der verantwortung hinterher auch stellen. abtreibung kann man geteilter meinung sein, ich pers?nlich wrde es nicht machen. habe auch 4 kids, bin auch gut verhtet das kein 5. kommt aber wenn es doch mal passieren soll (rein theroetisch) wrde ich das 5. auch mit gro? ziehen. es hat genauso ein recht auf sein leben wie die anderen kids auch. mal dafon abgesehen das ich nie mein eigenes kind umbringen k?nnte.    lg nic    @jackehammer_joe  nicht jede gro?e familie ist gleich assozial.  mann kann eine gro?famiele haben und deswegen genauso arbeiten und mit den kids umgehen wie alle anderen auch.  nur das mehrere kinder mehr aktion bringen. mir wird es nie langweillig|`|b924b5ac8e3710dec55066294f151c2aaa	Das w?r meine Frage gewesen, was h?lt die Dame von Sterilisation - oder ist sie unter 36 Jahre, da gibts n?mlich ne Beschr?nkung so viel ich weiss - na ja, es gibt Menschen die kann man nicht belehren|`|75863532620dde5214cc63f2d7ace655aa	Fr mich stand schon als Jugendliche fest, dass ich nie abtreiben wrde. Mittlerweile habe ich 4 Kinder und kann keine weiteren mehr bekommen. Auch wenn ich nicht sterilisiert w?re und schwanger werden wrde, k?me fr mich auf jeden Fall keine Abtreibung in Frage. Auch wenn das die "Gesellschaft" anders sieht, ist fr mich auch schon ein Embryo ein Lebewesen. Wer beim Sex nicht richtig verhten kann, ist selber Schuld. Gengend M?glichkeiten gibt es ja wohl zu genge...  Mittlerweile scheinen Abtreibungen auch schon zum Alltag zu geh?ren. Aber nicht nur bei kinderreichen Familien, sondern auch bei Alleinstehenden Frauen, Familien/Beziehungen bei denen die Karriere an erster Stelle steht und nicht in die Lebensplanung passt.   Ansonsten gibt es immer M?glichkeiten und Alternativen um nicht abtreiben zu mssen. Selbst wenn es sich dabei um eine Adoption handelt...
698b1d990360e49b07ffd71a461a1c01aa	Oh ja - meine Gte - ich kenne das zur Genge - habe es jahrelang als Alleinerziehende mitgemacht - doppelt schwierig als wenn noch ein Partner zur Untersttzung im Rcken ist.    Die Pubert?t setzt ja heute schon viel frher ein, man nennt sie halt auch Vorpubert?t. Die Kinder testen die Grenzen und ihren eigenen Willen aus, was sie alles erreichen und wie sie sich durchsetzen k?nnen. Euch doof zu nennen ist noch liebevoll ausgedrckt, da gibt es viel krassere Vulg?rsprache, die sie bei ihren Schulkameraden lernen und ich mir auch anh?ren musste.  Es geh?rt zur Pubert?t - ist eine beginnende Abl?sungsphase - dazu, die Eltern doof zu finden (wir verhalten uns ja auch oft so). Das eigenen Ich entwickelt sich st?rker und sucht nach Abgrenzung. Das geht leichter, wenn man die anderen negativ belegt. Es ist eine Suche nach dem eigenen Standpunkt, den eigenen Wertma?st?ben und dergleichen.    Diese Zeit (Jahre) k?nnen leichter bew?ltigt werden, wenn man versucht zu verstehen, was da abl?uft, worum es geht. Habe ich leider auch erst recht sp?t erkennen k?nnen.   Es geh?rt zu dieser Phase, alles und jeden zun?chst abzulehnen um sich selbst finden zu k?nnen.  Bin ich zu sehr in Liebe mit den anderen verbunden - bin ich beraus beeinflusbar und lenkbar. Will ich zu mir selbst finden. muss ich mich zun?chst abgrenzen und widersetzen.  Je mehr du versuchst zu diskutieren und zu erkl?ren, umso schlimmer wird dieses Abgrenzungsverhalten - wie gesagt krassere Formen werden dann genutzt um dies zu erreichen.    Untersttzen statt erziehen:  Ihren Weg zur eigenst?ndigen Entwicklung untersttzen und ein gro?es Ma? an Gleichwertigkeit in die Familie einbringen.  Z.B. sie kann sich doch hinstellen und bleiben wo wie will - dies ist ein austesten ihres eigenst?ndigen Wilens. Richtig ! - doch auch ihr habt eure Privatsp?hre. Und sie muss sich nicht in eurem gemeisamen Wohnraum aufbauen. Ihr k?nnt durchaus sagen, dass ihr eure Ruhe haben wollt und sie euch bitte allein lassen soll - doch nicht unbedingt mehr - und dies ist ein entscheidener Punkt -  wo sie hinzugehen hat - z.B. in ihr Zimmer - Es bleiben ihr ja noch andere M?glichkeiten - wie Flur, Toilette, Kche, Balkon etc.........    Sie m?chte in dieser Hinsicht keine Vorschriften gemacht bekommen. Will selbst entscheiden k?nnen, was sie tun will.  Ihr habt jedoch das gleiche Anliegen fr euch auch entscheiden zu k?nnen - z.B. wenn ihr eure Ruhe haben wollt - ihr dies zu sagen, da? sie euch bitte allein lassen soll. Damit drckt ihr euer Bedrnis aus mit einer Bitte und eurer Tochter bleibt ebenso ihr Wille, was sie jetzt mit sich machen m?chte. Dies kommt dann ganz anders bei ihr an.    Sie wird damit als autonomes eigenst?ndiges Wesen anerkannt, genauso wie ihr auch. Jeder braucht auch seinen eigenen Bereich, wo er auch selbst entscheiden kann, wann er da mit wem sein m?chte, oder auch allein - sie genauso.  Ich  habe dann bei meiner Tochter am Zimmer auch immer erst angeklopft - um ihr zu zeigen, das ich ihren Bereich als ihren eigenen respektiere. Da braucht es kein Ziehen am Pulli und dergleichen - wenn jeder die gleichen Rechte hat und sie gegenseitig geachtet werden. - Die Bitte einen in Ruhe zu lassen gengt.    Genauso ist es mit dem Verbieten von etwas. Auch hier gibt es meist Wahlm?glichkeiten. Und bestimmte Dinge gehen eben auch einfach nicht - welches auch begrndet werden kann, ohne das sie sich bevormundet fhlen braucht.    Vielleicht konnte ich dir hiermit ein wenig Anregung geben - wenn du magst, kansnt du mich auch gerne anmailen.  Alles Liebe fr Euch.|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Ich hab das gleiche gemacht, aber frag mich nicht warum.

Gerne l??t sie auch ihre jngere Schwester darunter leiden, will da? man sie bedient, ihr die Sachen hinterherr?umt; ach ja, und "auahhh" schreit meine Tochter brigens auch, wenn man sie z.B. am Arm nimmt, um sie in ihr Zimmer zu fhren!|`|e0729d54277a2b9a964d5c4fa9633d4faa	nun, das h?rt sich aber verdammt nach der Pubert?t an.... Bin selber erst 25 und habe somit kein Kind in dem Alter, aber ich war ja auchmal jnger und meine Mutter erz?hlt mir heute ganz gerne wie ich mal war....Nach Deinen Erz?hlungen muss ich ernsthaft an mich denken !! Meine Mutter hat mir damals soger mit einem Heim fr schwer erziehbare gedroht, so schlimm war ich!!So leid es mir tut, aber ich befrchte da musst Du jetzt einfach durch!! Ich drcke Dir die Daumen, dass sie nicht noch schlimmer wird! Setze ihr auf jeden fall trotzdem Grenzen, egal wie sie sich auffhrt, denn egal ob sie sagt sie braucht sowas nicht mehr, stimmt das nicht..sie braucht es mehr als je zuvor!!|`|6670caf1733a0dd1b8f2cc49b63db103aa	Die Pubert?t ist eine Phase, in der die Eltern anfangen schwierig zu werden!! Ja, deine Tochter fordert euch heraus und testet, wie ihr mit ihrer Provokation umgeht. Dass sie in dieser Phase ist, macht sie vielleicht auch nicht so glcklich. Sie wei? sicher, was in Ordnung ist und was nicht. Lasst euch nicht von ihrer Frechheit beeindrucken. Ich spreche aus eigener Erfahrung. Sicher muss man nicht wegen jeder Kleinigkeit berreagieren sondern ihr  sagen, dass einen das verletzt und man sich ungerecht behandelt fhlt, dass ihr Verhalten unfair ist. Schau mal wie sie darauf reagiert. Wenn ihr etwas nicht erlaubt, dann erkl?rt ihr hoffentlich auch warum und seid vielleicht auch zu Alternativen bereit. Deine Tochter ist jetzt 10 und mit jedem Jahr wird sie neue Freiheiten fordern. Trefft Vereinbarungen, die fr sie akzeptabel sind und fr euch. Lasst euch nicht auf Pulli-zieh-K?mpfe ein. Soll sie doch da stehenbleiben. Unterhaltet euch ber etwas Langweiliges. Ignoriert ihr Verhalten, wenn es einfach nur l?stig ist. Ansonsten habe ich mit einigen Sanktionen, die ich aber nur selten anwende, gewissen Erfolg. Dann steht halt das Telefon fr eine Weile nicht mehr zur Verfgung, oder der PC, der Fernseher usw. Warum soll ich jemandem, der mir gegenber unfair und rcksichtslos ist, meine Sachen zur Verfgung stellen?. Aber ganz wichtig ist auch, ihr eure Zuneigung zu zeigen. Reduziert sie nicht auf ihr jetzt schwieriges Verhalten. Zeigt, dass ihr sie ernst nehmt. Sagt ihr aber auch, dass es nur ein Familienleben ohne ?rger gibt, wenn jeder sich an bestimmte Regeln h?lt und den anderen respektiert. Und nehmt sie immer wieder in den Arm! Ihr msst allerdings auch erkennen, dass sie neue Freir?ume braucht, neue Verantwortung und Aufgaben.|`|c40eb1c4f3c2e9e3e0c08032f9e372f5aa	willkommen im club!!!meine tochter ist auch fast 10, st?ndige n?rgeleien,kein bock auf irgendwas usw,denke das ist sone vorpubert?re phase, stark sein, konsequent bleiben und hoffen dass diese jahre nicht allzu stressig werden.    lg anni|`|488ada6e8dfacf5d82ec1fa4462d6ddfaa	War bei unserer S?en genauso.

Deine Tochter ist momentan in einem Kampf mit sich selber, sie sieht in ihren Eltern die Feinde, und ist nur am provozieren!    Es ist schwer damit umzugehehn, aber lasst euch nicht auf sinnlose Diskussionen ein, das stachelt sie nur noch mehr an, und sie fhlt sich dadurch nur noch mehr im Recht!    Wenn sie meint stehen bleiben zu mssen, dann soll sie stehen bleiben, und wenn sie meint das ihr doof seid, dann lass sie das meinen. Die Hauptsache ist das ihr euch durchsetzt, und ihr klar macht das wenn sie Stur und bockig ist das sie dann auch die konsequenzen ihres Verhaltens tragen muss!|`|b2107b90dee5cc54849dc4c397a7d5f1aa	willkommen in der Pupert?t, ich habe eine bald 14 J?hrige Tochter die mit 9 Jahren genauso angefangen hat und es hat noch nicht aufgeh?rt. Es ist grausam manchmal diese Launen ertragen zu mssen und was man macht ist in den Augen der Kinder sowieso falsch. Bei uns ist es so das sie mit mir nichts anfangen kann und Papa der Liebe ist. Ich habe mir abgew?hnt stundenlang zu diskutieren, die wichtigsten Sachen sage ich ihm und er verkauft es ihr dann so das sie es versteht und umsetzt. So mache ich mir meine Nerven nicht mehr all zu sehr kaputt.  Ich warte auf den Tag andem ich morgens aufwache und sehe das mein Kind sich von einem kleinen Ungeheuer in einen Menschen verwandelt hat

1c18a97c59ea5a1a4c128debceae9bc4aa	I am a full time nanny.  I watch five children total, but one family has 3 children and the other has 2.  I make $50 a day working 8 hours for the 3 children family, and $40 a day for the 2 children family.  My job is a bit different since one of my bosses is also my pediatrician.  We never have to go to the office for visits.  Plus, I get to take my boys to work for me.  Also, the children range in age from 2-11 years.      You say at night, but not what time?  Is it evening into night?  Are the children awake for 2 hours after you get there?  I think it all depends on the time also.  May not seem fair, but if the majority of your time is spent in front of a TV instead of interacting with them I think the pay should be different.      Maybe you should ask her what she was thinking of paying.  Just remember that no amount of money will ever be enough for what you are going to give this family.  The children I nanny for have become like my own.  Just don't ever let the money get in the way.  Get it straight early so that it doesn't interfere with the relationship you will have with these children.|`|f1b2729a3a4098634e3a4f9ba584ddc7aa	my friend does the whole watching kids thing she has posters out and all and she tells the people up front she charges $10.00 and hour and she seems to make alot of money|`|a9f7d4387a9e414f757b727bf2a85b48aa	my mom did daycare and she charged per day and gave a discount because there were two kids.

db2e80f14c4b70acd112b7bb6d07286faa	Hallo, ich denke du solltest deinem Freund sagen, dass du zus?tzlich Tabletten nimmst. Mal ganz abgesehen davon, dass es um ein gemeinsames Kind geht, es k?nnen ja auch mehrere Eizellen durch die zus?tzlichen Hormone reifen und eine Mehrlingsschwangerschaft kann eintreten. Er muss sich ja auch bewusst werden, dass er bald Vater wird. Es ist doch viel sch?ner wenn ers wei?. Schau, wenn du dann schwanger bist, wirst du dich vielleicht schuldig fhlen, es ist doch ein kleiner Vertrauensbruch.

AA12212360	Pregnancy Induced Hypertension is one of the most common problems in mid to late pregnancy which is why we like to see you more frequently towards the end.    WHO GETS IT???  In some women certain factors make it worse  poor diet  obesity  age  general health  family history  this is not always the case even a super fit slim woman can have high blood pressure    WHAT DOES IT DO TO MY BABY  The problem is that it affects the blood flow to the placenta which starves the baby of essential nutrients  and we need to monitor   your level of BP  protein in your urine  growth of the baby  fluid volume  babies kicks and movements  and the aging process of the placenta  certain chemicals in your blood  all these are affected to varying degrees some are mild some moderate and some severe..    WHAT CAN I DO  Its hard to tell in some instances who will do well and who will do poorly so your responisibility is to   visit the doctor regularly  report   severe heartburn,   spots before your eyes,   blurred vision,   severe swelling,   headache or   reduction in baby movements    Dont stress be watchful and take it easy....|`|6a38a9df1c83dcbefbe1867631ef2e3daa	It is extremely important that you talk to a proper doctor about this.|`|94c914b76ef72295d33d2ec1ce1af73faa	i had pregnancy induced hypertension with my first.

If you're asking me as a member of Yahoo Answers, I'd say stay off your feet except to pee and that's it.
ae026ce8885ccc653e280c96e2e94ba8aa	es kann natrlich schon sein, dass es weh tut. aber mach dir darber keine gedanken. die hauptsache ist, dass du die sache entspannt und vorallem in ruhe angehst. wenn dein freund mit dir schlafen will, musst du zuerst dir selbst im klaren darber werden, ob du schon bereit dazu bist. wenn du zweifel hast, sag ihm offen, dass du noch nicht bereit dazu bist. du bist "erst" 14 - und das erste mal sollte man wirklich mit einem freien kopf geniessen k?nnen.    wenn dann im hinterkopf st?ndig fragen wie: tu ich das richtige, ist er der richtige etc. auftauchen, wartest du besser noch eine weile. du hast alle zeit der welt und NIEMAND kann dich dazu zwingen! auch wenn er dir sagt dass er dich liebt oder was auch immer. . . nimm dir einfach die zeit, die du brauchst und lerne zuerst dich und deinen k?rper / deine bedrfnisse kennen.     bei fragen einfach mailen :)|`|856d50e231fe9168dce1fb3bf609e620aa	Kommt drauf an wie entspannt du bist, wenn du dich komplett verkrampfst wird es weh tun.

Es gibt viele andere sachen die zuerst ausprobiert werden mussen. Stundenlanges kussen am ganzem koerper, fsse massieren bis man nicht mehr kann, halt alles was unter pedding fehlt. Aber mal ganz ehrlich dein koerper ist von oben bis unten mit nerven vollgestopft und sex ist nicht nur ein penis und eine vagina. Die Jungs habe keine ahnung was eine weibliche k?rper alles kann und braucht. Also lass dir zeit und probiere vieles aus aber lass ihn nicht rein, denn wenn er nicht weiss was er macht (mt 16 weiss es keiner) wird dein erstesmal keine feuerwerk erzeugen sonder nur trauer. Und ausserdem ich kenne keine die verheiratet ist mit ihren "erstenmal". Oh, nebenbei es ist das einzige was auf der welt dir allein gehoert und wenn du es einem idioten gibst wirst du es dein leben lang bereuen. Frage ein paar frauen die sagen es dir.  Kurz bei mir: Alles gemacht nur kein verkehr bis ich 21 war. Meine freudinnen von dasmal habe es mit ca15jahre gemacht und keine war gluecklich danach, sie meinten sie h?tten warten sollen bis sie wussten eigentlich was sie da machten, sie beneiden mich das ich so standhaft war und gewartet habe bis ich 21 wahr. Meine erstesmal war dadurch der himmel auf erden. Ich danke gott das ich die kraft hatte zuwarten denn es hat sich WIRCKLICH GELOHNT .  Wie immer du dich entscheidest "verhtten" nicht vergessen.

Fr mich war es schrecklich, aber deshalb weil ich ihn nicht geliebt habe und mich hinein gesteigert habe gleich wie du.     Viel Spa? beim ersten Mal.
e316ebd4512287a70638840f3b58c439aa	Meine kleine Schwester hat erst richtig angefangen zu sprechen, als sie in den Kindergarten gekommen ist. Vorher hab ich immer alles gesagt, sprich ihre "Laute" und Fingerzeige bersetzt.   Meine Ma war damals auch beim Arzt und der hat das gleiche gesagt. Und tats?chlich, als sie dann auf sich "allein" gestellt war, hat sie angefangen zu sprechen.  An deiner Stelle wrd ich ihr vielleicht Bilderbcher vorlesen und sie dann fragen, wo denn die betreffenden Sachen auf den Bildern sind.  Bei meinem Sittkind hats geholfen!|`|0989dc159b3f01c1aa0a4b0eaa56d727aa	ich kenne dein problem ziemlich gut. das war bei meiner tochter genauso. ich habe dann nachdem der HNO-Arzt mir auch so ne antwort gab, meine tochter bei der LOGOP?DIE angemeldet. Die Verordnungen bekommst du entweder beim Kinderarzt oder HNO-Arzt. Jetzt ist meine Tochter ihren gleichaltrigen freunden sehr voraus und spricht einwandfrei. Sie k?nnte sogar schon jetzt (mit 5) eingeschult werden.  Informiere dich doch darber. Kann ich dir echt empfehlen.  Viel erfolg.|`|511b1c5a0b392208b1ed88d7cb9cc9edaa	Mein ?ltester Sohn machte das auch , bei ihm ging es alles mit " DA " oder " HABEN " . Wenn er Lust hatte dann sagte er auch mal Mama oder Papa .

Immer wieder animieren. Sollte es dann in einem Jahr noch nicht besser sein, so kannst Du Dich um eine Sprachtherapie kmmern. Die hat z. B. bei meinem Sohn geholfen.

Da war es allerdings das Problem, dass er nicht gut geh?rt hat und er deswegen wenig oder undeutlich gesprochen hat. Aber wenn du schon beim Arzt warst...Vielleicht nochmal zu einem anderen gehen.  Naja da haben die Eltern es aufjeden Fall so gemacht, dass sie ganz viel mit ihm gesungen und getanzt hat. Die Musik hat er irgendwie besser geh?rt. Das k?nntest du aber auch in deinem Fall (wenn er nicht schlecht h?rt) mal ausprobieren. Mit Musik und Tanz macht dass dann viel mehr Spass und sie bekommt vielleicht die Freude am Singen und damit dann auch am Sprechen.|`|2527d20581eca75b0712964d9b5affdaaa	Hab Geduld!

e0729d54277a2b9a964d5c4fa9633d4faa	Ja, soweit ich weiss gibt es zwei Methoden von Sterilisation. 1. Eileiter verl?ten, das kann "falsch" gemacht werden, so dass doch noch ein Ei durchkommt und die Frau somit ungewollt schwanger werden kann. (wird aber glaube ich nicht mehr so gemacht)  2. Eileiter durchtrennen, die k?nnen wieder zusammengesetzt werden.

5b93b27133cfee8d0a62a8df53d362c5aa	What did your doctor say when he put the device in you 2 years ago?  Did he make an appt for a follow up in 2 years?    I don't know if you know this but there are a bunch of IUD's and the one I will be getting is Mirena.  It gets replaced every 2 years.    Call your doctor and ask whether you need a follow up.  Good luck chica.|`|850902bd7afa59d018f16498d0a6ce7aaa	It depends on the type of IUD you have. Copper IUDs have an effective lifetime of 10 years. The newer hormonal IUDs are only effective for 5 years. So you've still got plenty of time before it loses effectiveness. If in doubt, talk to your doctor. =)

Dann bilden sich Antik?rper in der Mutter, die das zweite Kind, sollte es auch Rh+ sein gef?rden k?nnen.|`|d2dc861987019f55a9a744f05a01dc11aa	Sollte das 2. Kind einen Vater mit anderem Rhesusfaktor haben, kann es sein, dass das Kind einen anderen Rhf. hat. Dann liegt eine Rhesusinkompatibilit?t vor. Es ist normalerweise blich einer Rh. negativen Mutter nach der Entbindung des 1. Kindes Spritzen zu verpassen, die verhindern sollen das es beim 2. Kind eben zu solchen Problemen kommt. Wenn der K?rper sich n?mlich gegen das "fremde" Blut wehrt, kann es zu einer Fehl-oder Frhgeburt kommen. Aber normalerweise wird das schon sehr frh in der Schwangerschaft festgestellt und es werden wiederum Spritzen verabreicht, damit so etwas NICHT passiert.
3bf402955c1d2a2cb03bdace6499ffbfaa	i really wouldn't trust a dollar store test. i would go to planned parenthood before relying upon one from the dollar store. blood test? what? usually it is urine to test for pregnancy at home...|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	i would do them both but the preg. test from the dollar store are good|`|384436d14895b87238e4d6a65042186daa	i along wiht many other girl used a dollar store test and it was accurate|`|29240247fc470b5492dd7a02961ffff2aa	Cheap tests are just as reliable as expensive ones...but the expensive ones sometimes work earlier in your cycle to detect pregnancy.    My gyno told me this.  He said he uses cheap tests in his office becuse they are just as good.  He told me not to waste my money on something more than a couple of dollars.|`|2c0249b5ab2ccd92ca98aa7a1b784d6eaa	Well, I wouldn't necessary use the $1.00 test as a definitive answer.  I would find $15 to buy a better test.  But you should take the test first thing with first morning urine, it has the most amount of hormones in it that will determine if you are pregnant.|`|0c77a3f55cdc1d7a3de6947125ea496eaa	That test is 50 miu and is an okay test. It may not detect it if you are under 1 month pregnant. you may need a test that is 20-25 miu because the lower the miu number, the more sensitive. The miu number will not be on the box itself, I had to look it up online and understand all that stuff last week. The 5 days sooner tests are the ones that you need and price makes a difference. DONT buy the walgreens one because thats 100 miu and its $9.00! I made that mistake the first time.|`|30e6deb42cc8684dd27648d45e36ccffaa	The best thing to do is to go to the Dr. if you really want to know for sure.|`|AA11637462	my sister took a test from the dollar store and it was right.  if you took one and it came out negative wait about 2 weeks....if you still don't get your period then take another test.  sometimes your hormone levels aren't high enough to show up on a pregnancy test till you are farther along.  i hope you get the results you want :)|`|AA11176631	im unclear about ur question but i can say ive taken all my test i got from the dollar store, and they were always right.|`|a20f915dfc010b2633207dde5c55ca95aa	If it said positive then odds are you are pregnant.  The pregnancy hormone is very strong.  If it says negative it could be too early so wait a week and retest.  Just to be satisfied I would buy a more popular brand.   Good Luck!|`|177e05bb524a1a375964636eb3e78012aa	My OB actually told me about this recently.  Her answer was "If you take a home pregnancy test and it tells you you are pregnant, you are.  Unless you got it from the dollar store"  Splurge, get a real pregnancy test, from a drug store or supermarket.  There is a reason those tests are being sold in the dollar store.

a2aa7dba09709aae46083f2e8ff8d6c7aa	susten is a tablet containing progesterone. many doctors administer it empirically in doses of 200-300mg twice a day without a documentary evidence of a deficiency of progesterone. well, no one wants to take chances. progesterone deficit does cause threatened abortion or actual abortion, and it's given to many patients who have had abortions in the past. you seem to have had only 1 abortion. and there's no harm in taking it. susten can be taken vaginally, orally or rectally. though the best mode seems to be vaginally from point of bioavailability. and yes, in this presribed dose when given for a limited period, say from few days to a month, there are no side effects. like when comparing risk benefit ratio, the benefits are far more compared to adverse side effects. few may get vomiting.|`|fb63b376bb9ea9b65502d283eb01add8aa	my doctor had also prescribe me those tablets but i m dont the use of them.|`|AA11739978	I agree with first post.

Good Luck!|`|e68d84143f7c39d7e0d2eff2f85439c8aa	yes, this is the time to go for the test.good luck.

Seriously, by strengthening her pelvic floor muscles she will have an easier time passing a baby through those same muscles and lessen her chance of needing an episiotomy. Also if she does these exercises before and after the birth her muscles will tighten back up much quicker. ;)|`|cb98ff54f667d8a5129386ee06c4ab22aa	Yoga! It strengthens the core, and helps with flexibility.. which really really helps at the time of delivery. It is also very calming and relaxing... which every pregnant woman needs.

Car vu le systme fran?ais, c'est encore crer de la dpendance. Les enfants c'est bien qd on en a trois. (cf allocation familiale ). Il y a bien plus d'avantages et bien moins d'imp?ts  payer. voila pourquoi la fcondit augmente. Vu que le taff est trop dur  trouver pour certains, il faut bien trouver une autre manire de se faire des sous. Le souci c'est : que vont devenir ces enfants dans 20ans ? Auront ils du boulots ?   C'est bien pour ?a que j'en ai qu'un seul. Je vais l'lever le mieux que je peux. lui donner toutes les chances de la russite. l'aider plut?t tard dans sa recherche de sa voie et ensuite de travail. car aujourd'hui qui peut s'en sortir tout seul?
