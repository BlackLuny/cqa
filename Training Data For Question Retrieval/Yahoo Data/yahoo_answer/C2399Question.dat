20090131135615AAVy5qz	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Student Loan Question! Please Help!?	I already receive a financial aid pell grant that basically just covers my books, and tuition. I have a very hectic shool schedule that doesn't allow me to work and maintain a high GPA. I have roughly 1300 dollars in credit card bills, I have a Suzuki GSXR motorcycle that I owe 8500 dollars on. I have good credit, but I show no income. I know someone wealthy that would co-sign with me if it would be possible for me to get a loan that would defer payments until I graduate. I need roughly 18-20K. I have about 2 1/2 years of school left, I would need to pay off my motorcycle, and credit cards. That would be about 10000 dollars, and the rest of the money would cover my living expenses until I graduate. Would someone please tell me if this would be possible, and if so, where would be the best place to go? Someone please give me some advice. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment.

20090131150104AAublvO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I re-send my high school transcript to colleges?	Because the semester just ended and I still haven't submitted applications (don't worry, they're no deadlines; they are rolling). So last semester I sent my transcripts but they didn't include 1st semester senior grades. But now 1st semester of senior year just ended, and my applications still aren't in so should  I re-send my transcripts so they get a more accurate picture of me? Or would it just create confusion?      By the way I believe I got these grades this semester: a C in Government (it's part of AP econ), a C in Math Analysis, a B in Spanish 5-6, and an A in AP English.      These are considerably lower grades than the rest of my high school career.      Should I resend my transcripts?      Thanks.

20090131150323AAtqbEg	Education & Reference;Other - Education	My brainstorming crisis?	It feels like I've been having a major writing problem now.  On my English midterm, we had 50 minutes to write a 3-5 paragraph essay.  I only calmly manage to complete 1 paragraph before I was completely stuck.  The other 2 was plain crap that didn't even make sense.  The only time when I can write a good essay is if it was for homework.  Even then, it would take me 3 hours and I would need the internet for ideas.  Last year in the 9th grade I never had this problem.  Why is this happening??  I'm an Honour Roll student so getting even a C+ is really upsetting.   My friends suggest that I should brainstorm ideas like I'm preparing for an essay.  What do you guys think? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks.

There are some parameters here that me and my old college roommate worked out after hours of debating this...   1) a random sampling of 3rd graders (i.e. 51% female)   2) you are armed with normal clothing, steal-toed-boots, and a cup   3) picture a football stadium (no field goal posts), you're on the 50 yard line, and the gates open, kids rush in from every available entrance   4) you have 3 months to get in shape, the kids have not   5) it is kill or be killed, the rules have been explained to the children   6) it is 2:00, we can assume they packed their "regular" lunch for school that day and ate it at noon... as far as sugar intake is concerned...   7) I have considered the psychological breakdown of 3rd graders, I don't know enough to "know" what they'd do, consider this while answering   8) There is a time limit:10 hours. If one side (you or the 3rd graders) isn't dead at midnight, (it starts at 2:00 PM) EVERYONE gets napalmed.      I'm looking for thoughtful, imaginative answers, with logical reasoning for or against the destruction of 500 3rd graders.  Please don't just say "yes" or "no"

20090131155434AAYIkAv	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Did anyone else hear about this, or just me?	BILLERICA -- It's called "sexting."      Police have another name for it: child pornography.      A nude or seminude picture of a 14-year-old Marshall Middle School girl circulating through the community by cell-phone text messages this week is under investigation by Billerica police and the Middlesex District Attorney's Office.      The girl sent a text message with the photo as an attachment to a boy at Billerica Memorial High School. But she didn't realize she could be betrayed when the picture was forwarded to others, police said.      "I think it was naiveté," said Sgt. Roy Frost. "I don't believe it was her intention to distribute it at the level it happened. I believe it was just the one person."      Police Chief Daniel Rosa was equally stunned by the girl's bad decision and could not offer a motivation. Now he's afraid the picture will make its way onto the Internet. He's urging parents to check their children's cell phones and delete the picture if they find it.      "I think kids typically don't think of a consequence or long-term consequences of their actions in a lot of regards, and this is one of these examples," Rosa said. "Parents need to keep a watchful eye on what their kids are doing."      Police and school officials in Salem, N.H., dealt with a similar situation in November when pictures of Salem High School girls in various states of undress circulated through the community, including at least one of a girl younger than 16.      "I explained   to parents that this isn't a Salem issue. It's a societal issue that's going across the country," Salem High School Resource Officer Matthew Norcross told The Sun last night. "It's my belief that kids are being desensitized by watching sexy television shows, movies or video games. They think nothing of it."      One parent at the Billerica High basketball game last night said the picture was posted on YouTube at least briefly.      "When I was a kid my mother said, 'Don't put anything in writing.' Now it comes back and parents have to say, 'Don't put anything on the computer," said the mother of two, who declined to give her name.      A Marshall Middle School teacher caught a student texting in class Thursday morning, Rosa said. When the teacher confiscated the telephone, the teacher found a nude picture of the girl attached to the message.      The School Department sent a letter home to parents, warning them the picture is circulating among students, Rosa said.      "Unfortunately, between the investigation between the School Department and us, (we've learned) this picture has been sent from phone to phone to phone among students," Rosa said. "It's really snowballed, and dissemination of child pornography is a crime, a serious crime."      In the Salem case, Norcross said that after consulting with the county attorney, school and police decided not to press charges, but rather, "educate." The 10 or so students who were involved -- both boys and girls -- were put on notice. And what constitutes child pornography was explained to the entire student body, he said.      "We haven't had a problem since," Norcross said.      Charges were filed earlier this month, however, in the western Pennsylvania town of Greensburg against three teenage girls for sending nude or seminude pictures of themselves, and against three boys for storing the pictures on their cell phones.      In the Billerica case, sentiment was running toward sympathy for the girl last night, but her peers also felt she may be judged harshly.      Keith DellaPorta, 17, a senior, said he went to a party last night and the picture was widely discussed. It was not sent to him, but he saw it. He believes trading nude pictures is done more often than is publicized.      "I heard she's a good kid, too," DellaPorta said.      A recent survey by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and CosmoGirl.com indicated about 20 percent of teens have sent or posted naked or seminaked pictures or videos of themselves.      A 14-year-old freshman girl attending a basketball game at the school last night said she wouldn't send a nude picture of herself to make a boy like her, but added that she would not criticize the other girl.        "She can do what she wants but texting is not the safest thing to do. ... It's easy for one person to text another and rumors spread," the girl said.      Rosa said he does not believe the students realized that forwarding the picture is considered dissemination of child pornography.      It is too early to determine whether charges will be filed against anybody, Rosa said.      Calls to Superintendent of Schools Anthony Serio were not returned yesterday. Marshall Principal Roland Boucher declined to comment last night. Calls to several School Committee members also weren't returned.      A school representative at last night's game, where a Sun reporter and photographer were trying to interview students and parents about the case, declined to identify himself. But he called police and had them escort t

Reason being my family can't really afford anything outside of school so everything i do mostly have to be inside school(etc such as extra-c and i do that. i go to clubs and in the basketball team not that good but yea.)Though i am a str8 student... but that doesn't make me any different from those other couple of millions of people. So even if i do get into a good college or college of my choice. I'll need a scholarship, my family isn't that financial my parents and i are immigrants(came at the age of 9) and they don't speak english. By all means they can't help me in any decision whatsoever but that's okay... Therefore i must get a scholarship even bits are fine because scholarships are awesome... so i wonder where can i start? in the search of scholarships to get a head start? (i am an 8th grader btw)

This is about my mother and her influence in my life.I already posted the bottom on yahoo and got some good feedback so I decided to add more lines to it. I am hoping that at the end, I will write enough paragraph for a college essay.What do you think? Once again, feel free to share your own philosophy of life or correct any mistake in mine            “She built a kingdom of knowledge with a third grade education. She has more wisdom than the intellectuals who claimed to be philosophers. Her voice could turn the stubborn to the right direction, her hands could feed the world. When injustice and impunity filled my heart with anger, disgust and resentment, it was in her arms that I discovered the power of forgiveness. She is not a divine creature, thus there is no way that she could suddenly change the negative feelings that I carried in my heart. However, I was to liberate myself till I let my heart ill from within. I realized and understood that A young heart must liberate itself from the dark relic of its past in order for it to reach the dream that it has always fought for. Regrets can only hold it in a backward abysmal and make it bitter. Sadly, a heart that is rotten by bitterness can become a dark nest where hate likes to grow. I should not hate my imperfections because hate makes one blind and obstructs their judgment. It is hard to forget past mistakes and to forgive those who has hurt me but instead of moaning on what has been done I ask God for the courage to accept the things that I cannot change and the wisdom to accept what I cannot change.

Let's say you ask someone what school they went to. And they answer, "Michigan!" Usually, I don't really care which Michgan school they went to. I just think, "Oh he graduated from the Michigan school sysytem." If someone else says, Missouri, or Illinois or wherever, does it matter to you which school it was? Or do you follow up by asking which school? I know some people will say that if a person graduated from Michigan-Dearborn, then that person would stick Dearborn on the end, but in my experience, that hasn't been the case. Does it matter to most people which school?

So I was born in the south of England in Surry and was raised in Hampshire, so therefore I consider myself British blood through and through.    I know some people consider themselves English, Scottish, Welsh, and N. Irish. But we are all one nation and I want to know what happened to national pride.    Wheres the parades for our fallen and returning soldiers, who fought and sacrificed them selves so you can sleep well at night, who fought hard in battles with Britains enemys and who spilt blood for Britain. Where the flags in the streets, I dont want to go overboard like the Americans but we should stand up and be proud of our country.     We have done so much for this world properly more than any other country and we dont celebrate this. I feel very privileged to live in Britain. You get free Healthcare, the school system is fantastic comparing it to other countries and we supply houses to the poor and the people who cant afford it.    Over the past 40 years we have allowed people from all over the world to come and live in our country, some people think this is a bad thing, but I think it is a good thing if taken in moderation. I dont want to start arguments as I know how some people feel about this topic so this is just my opinion one mans opinion and we live in a land with freedom of speech so. I think that this increase of different religions, faiths and race does the country some good. We are a multi cultured nation and this just show that people want to live in our country for one simple reason. Because its a great country to live in.    We have given the world many years off fantastic music and films, we have provided help in countries who needed it and we are a very generous nation. So I dont know about you but I am so proud to be British and so should you.     http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/B...

20090226090015AAwpG1B	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Some kid nearly cut the tip of my finger off and he's not even sorry...?	There is this kid at my school who lifted up the corner of a picnic table about 12 of us were sitting on. Here's what it looks like as I none of the doctors knew what I was talking about. Only ours is square.    http://www.barcoproducts.com/images/uplo...       So some kid kind of jolted it, and it was a little funny. Only (I'll call him Jake) came over and lifted the entire corner very high, and my fingers went through the holes and caught between the table and the foundation. When the table shifted, the foundation cut through the tip of my middle finger and started bleeding a lot. I had to be sent home from school to get to the doctor and it turns out that the cut went through and sliced through my bone. They had to stitch it up, and now I have to wear a splint on my finger for the next 6-8 weeks. It hurts really really bad and I'm even on narcotics. He barely cares that he did that and only very insincerely apologized when the principal made him. I would have so much more sympathy if he was sorry, but I don't want him to get off easy. I want him suspended, but I think they're just gonna let him off with a warning. Who should I talk to?

They teach us the most pointless things. For example, how to analyze Shakespeare, chemical formula breakdowns, ridiculous pointless Algebra and Geometry. I understand we should all have a basic understanding of certain subjects like how our planet works, and we should also know a little about the human body. Obviously we need to know basic math. Everything after Pre-Algebra is pointless. Analyzing literature essays is ridiculous. The school system is so left and corrupt. They need to teach us useful things like how the economy works, how loans work, how to buy houses/cars, manage check books/bank accounts. AVID shouldn't be an elective. Everyone should have help getting in college. They make it so impossible now to get to college. I'm a pretty smart kid. I have a pilots certificate and a drivers license so I'm not a retard. But most likely I'm not going to a 4-year university because I'm a B-C student. What is your opinion?

20090226090207AAXumiB	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Tuition disagreement (I can't pay the full amount) --- do I have options?	The Principal at my sons' private Catholic school wants me to pay full tuition for this school year.      Last year, we became ineligible for the 50% tuition assistance we've received in our first 2 years. I told him only 2 kids will be enrolled and told him the maximum amount I can pay. He told me to enroll all 3 kids and said he will "help" me. We were waiting on the result of our reapplication for financial aid so he did not decide how much I should pay. I kept asking him throughout the year how much I will end up paying, but each time we met he just kept talking about what else we can do to get me more financial assistance. By August, without luck with the applications and not knowing how much I'll pay, I offered to withdraw 2 of my kids. He just kept saying he will help me with the tuition. Last week he said my son will not graduate if I don't pay the full invoice.       I have proof that:      (i) I told him before enrolling my kids how much I can pay for tuition      (ii) I have asked him over and over again how much I will end up paying      (iii) I have only initially enrolled 2 kids; my 3rd son was enrolled past the enrollment deadline      (iv) I wanted to withdraw 2 of my kids in August      I can't pay the full amount and I feel that I should only pay what I committed to. Is there any chance that I won't need to pay more than the amount I comitted to given the circumstances? What else can I do?      I appreciate your advise.

But now im a little dissapointed....i wish i could start new again cause its kinda fun...   So heres what my question is: do you think the following idea is really stupid/not possible   if i looked for boarding schools in different parts of the u.s think i could like spend half a year somewhere and then switch or spend a school year somewhere and then switch schools? (i mean i have another 3 years of high school) i know i might sound really crazy cause most ppl my age hate moving...and ya leaving ppl behind is sad but i love seeing a new place....so yaa....      anyways thnk i could actually do that? and if not any ideas of something else i could do...i mean lifes so short i wanna like see it all i guess haha anyways any answers r appreciated....   <33
