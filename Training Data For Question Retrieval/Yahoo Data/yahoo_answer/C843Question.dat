20090202155157AA20SvK	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Business Tax question?

20090202135603AArWQM7	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Financial Services	Employment at bank if Chexsystems a problem?	Hi, I want to work for a major bank. About 4 years ago, I had a problem with a totally different bank and they charged me a bunch of overdraft fees.  They will not come off those fees and thus, I was reported to Chexsystems.  I have an open checking account in good standing, which has been open for about 4 years with another bank.      Now, I am trying to get a job at a totally different bank.  My overall credit score is about average: near 700.  Do you think the bank would not hire me if I had an account dispute unresolved with a totally different bank from 4 years ago?  Thanks.

I've been asking a lot of questions about this same problem and some have given me good advice. however I still have a couple of questions that I need to make sure of.      I'm suspended right now. I cannot enter my job until suspension is over. I want to quit. My question is. should I do it during my suspension period and risk getting in trouble or wait till I go back to work and do it then.       How I got suspended was my fault. and I think they may fire me the day I come back. Co-workers before me were in my situation and thought they'd be back on the job. instead they get fired.       I guess I want to beat them to the punch and tell them I quit before they even get the chance to fire me. I'll be telling them I'm quitting by the last second. the same day they may be planning on terminating me.       will this count as me quitting or will they say I got fired?

20090202200710AAOIktZ	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	The bank closed my account?	Our bank recently closed our checking account due to overdrafts, crazy thing is, I deposited money immediately to cover the overdrafts and now we have over 1000.00 in the account, I have checks that I have written that are out and they would be covered but the bank closed the checking account to all activity.  I cant use our debit card nor write checks.  I guess they have to make there money somehow, Im just curious as to what my legal options are? Granted, I wrote the bad checks but I realized this and made deposits to cover them.  I took responsibility and the bank is not cutting me any slack. I feel as if they have hijacked my money and they are waiting a week to send us the cashier's check. Our tax return also automatically deposits friday so there's going to be a huge amount of money in our closed account. I bet the bank is drooling because they are wanting there cut. I'm about ready to hide all my money under the mattress. Is there anything legally that I can do?

I later got ANOTHER 1098 (bought a home and the first mortgage company sold it to another and I jumped the gun and thought I had all my forms already)  WOrks out in my benefit.       QUestion:  should the amended tax refund (1040 X) have the refund amount of 855 (the difference of the first one WITh changes) or should it say the total REFUND of 5855?  I think it should just have the 855 since the other 5000 is coming with the FIRST 1040 filed????

Due to recession lost most of my work last year so relied on cards, so now have problems with the foreign one, (where I live now) as I borrowed against it only was not able to make last payment which was 2 weeks ago. Work has still not recovered either and last salary was not paid, so still fighting that.      Currently. Aussie one is ok, but not enough to pay what is needed on the foreign one which does belong to the citibank group.      Thinking of returning to Aus to sort everything out from there with financial advisor etc and more importantly to get work there to get a full time income.      1) Is it possible to sort things out from there with it being a foreign credit card? (Have looked here for financial advisors, but language barriers etc).      2) Can I be kept from leaving the country?      3) What is BEST course of action?      I do want to sort things out, but feel I am better off doing it from HOME and in a better work situation.      Such a dilemma and I do want to resolve it.

Here's the situation:      My husband and I both have poor credit ratings due to one point in time when we had some financial problems beyond our control.  We had several missed payments on several accounts (some as late as 90 days, but none were sent to collections).      Over the past 3 years or so, we have making on-time payments on all our bills, but usually just the minimum... so our cards are pretty much maxed out.      My husband has recently finished his training, however, and will be making six figures once he starts his new job next month.      We should be able to pay everything down within two months.      We would like to buy a house asap, but have no money to make a downpayment at this time.  Combined with the spotty credit history... what are the chances that we can get a mortgage?  How about a mortgage with no downpayment?  Any suggestions???      Thanks in advance!

I'm curious how those Mortgage Companies work. Our credit isn't exactly perfect, it's decent though.  Currently, for the past 9 months we've been renting a 1 BR apartment for $780/month.  We're wanting a house.  Renting a house in a decent area will be between $850-1000/month-- which is a house payment!  It just seems to be a waste to rent.  What do the mortgage companies consider when deciding to finance you?  I'm just starting out in my career, but combined my fiance and I make just under $75K/year.  We also wouldn't have a down payment but I see all the time homes with 100% financing. What are our chances of getting approved?  We're going to look at a house tomorrow - 1600 sq ft that is listed for $122k here in the Memphis, TN area.  And is there something we need to watch out for when speaking with Mortgage Companies?
20070312124046AApoel9	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Son Moved out of Apartment (30) days ago with carpet damage, still no word?	My son moved out of his apartment (30) days ago, he lived there 5 1/2 years. His dog dis do some damage to the carpet. He did have a $500 pet deposit. When he moved out they told him they would notify him about damage/deposit etc. So far he has heard nothing, he was expecting a big bill for the carpet.      Questions: How long can they wait before he can rest easy 30-60-90,days or longer?      After 5 1/2 years...would normal wear & tear be counted in??      He did notice that people that moved in out of the complex that they would automatically replace the carpet no matter if they stayed 5 years or 5 Months, they do advertise that every apartment has new carpet...I think that is a  matter of policy!

I am desperetly wanting to buy a house instead of renting again. I need a much bigger house than the rental home we're currently in.  I would like to start the process to purchase in about 2 weeks.  I was planning to put 30,000 down however it seems I shouldn't do that because my mortgage will still be the same each month I'm told. My credit is in bad shape for stupid things. In total I'm in debt about $3,500 half of that is medical bills. I just got my credit report and plan to pay it off, however I'm told don't pay it off make payments to build credit. I don't know what to do to start or what route to take. I am currently living in NW Indiana but this area is so overpriced for mostly crap houses. The houses that I've found that are decent are too high , I know I wouldn't get qualified for that amount. I always hear about 1st time homebuyers programs, yet I've not comes across any online info.

20070328113826AAr5DGB	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What impact does co-applicants credit score have on mortgage rate?	My fiance are getting married in six months.  We plan to buy a house together before the wedding.      My credit score is excellent (over 750).  Hers is in the good range (around 650-700), but it's only because she has student loan debt...she's never missed a payment or been late.       I know I would get a very good interest rate and would qualify for the full amount if I applied for the loan without her on the application.  If we applied as co-applicants, would I introduce the risk of us getting a higher interest rate because of her score being a little lower?      If that were the case, does anybody have any recommendations on whether it's possible to have me as the only name on the mortgage but be able to add her to the title at or after the close?  Thanks!

The mark of a pro is that he will beat an amateur in a series of bets in the area of expertise.  Financial experts should beat the market, which is composed of partly amatuers like me, and partly of pros.      It occurs to me to offer a sum of money to a pro for management on these terms.  Invest it NYSE & NASDAQ listed securities.  Each day, if the value has gone up, the pro gets 50% (yes, 50%) of the profit, and the value is re-baselined for the next day.  If the value value goes down, the pro contributes his own capital to make up the loss, bringing the value to what it was at the start of the day.      Are there any pros confident enough in their ability that they can make money on those terms?

The rent is the same although its said that utilities are cheaper and the rent wont go up yearly in the house? The job my fiance would be commuting to would be a firefighting job, so for 6 months while he's in the academy he will have to go to work every weekday but after that he will have a firefighters schedule   one day one, one day off, one day on, three days off, one day on, one day off, one day on, on day off, 5 days off. So after 6 months he wouldnt have to go to work every single day.

20070418010656AAeszGB	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	I want to go back to college but how can I under this circumstance?	Here's my situation:   I do not live with my parents, and must hold down a full-time job in order to pay rent and utility bills. The only thing I pay for extra is my DSL, I don't even have cable TV and I'm barely making rent.       In order to be able to have the time to go back to school and get the classes I need, I would have to work part-time and therefore could not make rent at all.       The degree I'm pursuing is a Telecommunications degree, which would make me eligible to start at around $50,000 a year (according to the professor and one of his students) once I completed the course and came out of there with the degree.       Currently I make just barely enough to survive, if my hours are cut I will not have the money to pay for my place to live.    To get a better job I would need to have another degree which as you can see, I don't have the time to get because I have to maintain my place to live (which is actually very cheap for its condition and the area).      Any suggestions?

20090202214328AAzAtK3	Business & Finance;Credit	Has anybody ever had GMAC lie to them Just so they can repo your car?	Ok I was late on my payments and I called GMAC on 9th and told them I can pay the full bill by the 20th. and that I will be getting some money the next day and would sent that to them in the mail the next day.  They said that would be fine but if they did not get the full 3 payments they would repo the truck on the 21st.  I told them that if I could not pay by then I would surrender the truck to avoid all the extra cost and they said ok.  They took my truck on the 14th.  The check I mailed to them for one payment was cashed by them on the 13th.  In my book that would only make us 2 payments short and I feel they should have waited.  I got the money on 20th like I promised but to get my truck back they wanted the last 2 payments and one forward plus repo fees of $600.00.      I live on Maui and they take the repoed cars to Oahu for auction but I made the payment and the repo guy said that the truck was still here and as soon as he got the paper work to release it I can get it.  I called the head repo office in Oahu and they said they have not got any paper work yet and did not know where my truck was.  I asked them to call me back when they found it and got the paper work.  They said they would and they did call back and said they just got the release form.  I asked where do I have to go to get it and they said that the truck was shipped to Oahu that morning and that I would have to pay the shipping cost to and from Oahu.  They said it would be a few days to get the totals together and they would call back.  She called me back as promised but she said it would be a few more days.  I waited 2 day and then started calling them as I did not want to pay storage fees.  I called from 27th to 30th with no answers and no call backs.  I then called her manager and she said that they have been waiting for payment from me.  She said they had the total 3 days ago and charged me $1,580.00 to get it back but they could not ship it now because I missed the shipping turn in date.  But she will get it on the Feb 3rd ship.  and it will take 2 more days to before I can pick it up.        So 22 days it will be to get my truck back and $2,180.00 in extra cost.  Does anybody think this is fair? and has anybody had a story like this? and did you report them to the BBB.org?  and what did the BBB.org do for you.      I tried calling several lawyers but they won't touch this case.  I guess they feel it is below them.  I was also fired from 2 good paying jobs and I would like to get compensation of up to $25,000.00 as that is the total of the 2 contracts I had lost plus the fees they charged by lying to me.      Anybody know a lawyer that will take on this case?

20090202223812AAomP8q	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	(Careers & Employment) What can I do for a job in 2 years hypothetically ?	I know that demand in several job markets will plunge in 2 years.     Just by reading some of the people's comments here, it seems like no job profession is safe from being shipped overseas or has the same type of benefits as advertised by hearsay. I'm a lot more conscious of getting a job right after graduating than I was 2 terms ago. I'm not sure what path to take really. In the past 4 terms, I've tried everything from art, biology, chemistry, math, computer programming, history, philosophy, english, etc and the thing is -- I'm still not entirely sure what to commit to by the 3rd year     I want to major in math and philosophy, but I'm scared of the job opportunities that are related to these two fields. Both end up in the teaching profession and both are practically useless in the business world. I feel like majoring in something is a balancing act between enjoying what you do and knowing that in the end you get rewarded for studying so hard but with the way things are going now, its hard to be that optimistic
20070501203825AAAuUT4	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Am I overextending on this mortgage?	We are a single income household with a toddler and a baby due in June.  We have perfect credit, but a military income of about $2500 take home a month.  We have $50,000 for a down payment on a $200,000 home.  The mortgage lender priced us at around $1500 for a fixed 30 year mortgage.  That is more than one paycheck!!  I really want the house, but it seems like too much of a stretch....suggestions?  It is new construction, so if we go with them, they pay closing costs, interest on construction loan, and knock $5,000 off the purchase price.

I took my client to see a house today and in front of the house there was a lock box so immediately I thought no body lived in that house (probably the owner left a blank house like other houses for sale). When I open the lockbox, the key came out, I used that key to open the door, suddenly a tenant inside of the house appeared and was very mad, yelled at me at lot. That was a misunderstanding because if I knew someone lived in the house then I wouldn't do that. I forgot to call the listing agent before I came. Can I get sue because of that? I hadn't walked in the house, I just opened it. That's all.

My question is my husband has a Bankruptcy that is supposed to fall off this year, and he has a couple of credit cards that have small balances but maxed out.  We are going to try and wait until his Bankruptcy comes off and until we have more paid off of his credit cards.  Should we be able to get approved?  I don't want to go on the loan, as I don't have income and I have more credit card debt.  My husbands score is better than mine, also.  He really only has about 1500.00 in Credit card debt, two car loans, and then the Bankruptcy.  Since his bankruptcy he has had NO late payments and nothing negative on his credit.  I am just worried that when June comes and we want to apply that we won't get approved.  Will it be okay if I don't go on the loan (Approval wise)?

(current price around $12.90) Since I want to limit my loss, I created a stop order today at $10.00. On the other hand, I'd like to sell my options when the prices rises to around $15.00. If I'm correct this is a situation where a limit order should be placed at $15. (correct me if i'm wrong).    My question would be: since I already placed a stop order on the options, would the orders be exactly the same as stop-limit order if I go ahead and place a limit order?      or       Should I cancel my stop order and place a stop-limit order combination?

20070509160920AA9S5kS	Business & Finance;Credit	I'm looking for bad credit personal loan. Because of  recent loan scam, I'm even more desperate. Advice?Help?	FICO score in the 500's. This is because many different loan inquiries at once, and slow/late payments because I've fallen behind. I spent most of my savings on fulfilling my dream of starting my own business. I work full time at a pediatric hospital and as an internet entrepreneur. I make good money, but am plagued with bad credit and I don't own a home, though that is a future goal. I desire a loan to pay bills and finance home businesses. Previously I've been caught in the payday loan trap and borrowed against my retirement. These sources have only helped briefly and basically I need a larger amount ($10,000-15,000 USD) with an interest rate of 18% or less that'll allow me to consolidate/payoff high interest credit cards/loans and buy some much needed equipment for my home businesses. If anyone can offer advice or help and please don't be a scammer, then I'd like to hear from you. Thanks.

20070524173622AAPmBRN	Business & Finance;Investing	Best Discount Broker For My Situation?	Greeting Everyone!      I am just getting into stock trading and have red a few books. Or actually, I am still in the process of reading a few good books.  I have an idea of my stock strategy, but would like to know the best discount broker for this strategy.      My strategy is basically a growth and value investing strategy.  With this trading strategy I will likely buy/sell a few stocks per month.  Definitely not day trading.  I might buy some stocks that fit my criteria and then also buy more of that same stock when it goes down in price and still meets my criteria.      I will also probably not use my broker for most of my research, but an outside source.  So really I just need a broker strictly for the trading.  So I am wondering what the best "bang for my buck" would be in this situation.      Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.      Thanks everyone.

The apartment managers want to keep it a secret from the residents.      There is a system where you punch in a resident's unit number and the security system will dial the resident's phone and they can let you in by pressing "9" on their phone, but there is also this secret code that opens the gate. It just makes me curious what it is.

20090202203158AAstWyu	Business & Finance;Insurance	California workers comp settlement rate, does anyone know how much I might receive or what I should ask for? ?	I had an injury in 2005 and a surgery in 2006, and have been considered permanently disabled and stationary since 2007. I've meet with a few Dr.'s to get second opinions and they've all come back with the same conclusion that there's nothing else they can do. I'm considered to have an 11% whole person impairment. The injury was to my knee and they want to have a settlement. I know the smart thing to do would be to get a lawyer and I will if it comes to that but I was just curious if anyone could tell me what I should be expecting from them, or what I should request. I'm not hoping to hit the "jackpot", I just want something reasonable. Anyone have any idea what I can expect to hear from them and have any suggestions? Is there a general way they figure out settlements?   Thank you in advance!

How can I make the most of this money right now? *I don't want to hear about risky/shady pyramid schemes.*
20090202211617AAPnZeP	Business & Finance;Credit	My business partner couldn't pay his personal credit cards and house payment any more?	the sad part is we have a business together under an LLC.  We each has a business credit card that link to our SS#.  My credit card has 0% and the balance of 9k.  His card has 0% with the balance of 19k.  I'm afraid the interest on his cc will go up because of it. Of course, I'm still  making monthly payment to our business credit cards .  We can't payoff the 19k right now.  What do you think will happen? What should I do?

20090202213724AAGdJxy	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Help with my taxes please??? State taxes?	I am filing on Turbotax.  I lived in Virginia until March 15th of 2008 and then I lived in Wv for the rest of the year.  I was employed by the same company for the whole year.  Now, when doing my state taxes for Virginia, do I just take my whole years wages and divide it up so that I am only putting what I made from January 1st 2008 until March 15th 2008 in Virginia?  Because it is asking me to allocate it and I entered in what I felt I made from Jan 1st to March 15th and it is giving me this HUGE refund amount that I do not feel is right.  I mean, I am not complaining but I don't want to get in trouble for doing my taxes wrong.

We were initially unable to attend the appointment of the audit due to being stuck out of town because of car problems so the lady did the audit without us.  She sent a paper saying we owe over $2000. (which is wrong) because she didn't account for my 3 kids.  Anyway, I'm sure we don't owe this amount.  Should we wait to file our 2008 taxes though until after we meet with her?  They wouldn't try to take that out of our 2008 refund would they?
