20090220204438AAq51uO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy:Could my body/brain be telling me something different from what docs say?	I am 34 weeks by what my doc says. However, looking at when my last period was would put me at 36 weeks. Also have been measuring 2 cm larger than I am supposed to. I have had an intense nesting feeling the last week or so. My husband has even been "nesting". we both just have this innate urge to clean everything.. I delivered my first son at 35 weeks due to pre-eclampsia and still had not even began the nesting stage.      Also (maybe tmi) For the last week or so I keep feeling wet down there. I can even feel whatever it is come out and it feels like bubbles. (??) My panties have gotten pretty wet but there is usually no discharge when I wipe. There was a lot about a week and a half ago but not since I have been getting that wet feeling.  I just keep thinking I am going to go into labor soon. I talked to me doc about it today and he said it sounds more to him like I'm just a little overly sweaty. He saw no reason to check my cervix at 34 weeks.. Baby is head down and he said he is really low. Not sure if he is engaged or not cause I forgot to ask.       Is it possible that I am further along and that my body is telling me that? Anyone else have a similar sitch happen to them?       My due date by my last period was March 14. But when they did the early ultrasound it put me at April 1st. Could the U/S maybe have just been wrong?

20090220202327AABuqIh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should i just be CARE FREE?	Not as in I don't give a $hit about the world but just be stress-free, and less paranoid with what is going on around you.      If you saw the movie "Yes Man" would you say it had a great   moral to it.      I've been paranoid and self-conscious practically my WHOLE life and I'm starting to think maybe I should just not really worry about whats wrong with ME and the people around me.
20090220204040AAP40f6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	I dont know what to do about my birth mom?	I found her recently we talked on the phone once but its mostly been emails. I call her by her first name, she says thats fine, she understands I already have parents. We emailed alot at first, but I kind of ran out of things to say. Im not much of a talker. I really care about her I think. I dont know its kind of hard because I never met her but I worry if something I say might hurt her feelings or make her sad. I dont want her to be sad. I thought some of the stuff I wanted to know about I was a peace with but im relizing now that I guess I just burried some of the stuff and never truly delt with it. I guess im asking if do you think she might be dealing with some stuff also? Could this be why she stopped emailing me? I try to email her but I seem to be able to only come up with a couple sentances and less then that if she sends one back and I reply. She hasnt tried to email me in a while. I sent her a text on valentines day and she never responded. I guess im scared if i dont have constant contact she will dissapear out of my life. Is all this normal? Also on mothers day would it be weird to send her a card? Like I said I dont call her mom but I just want her to know I think about her alot and i dont know i guess I wished we lived closer so we could have a relationship. What about when I get married would it be weird to invite her? Would it hurt her feelings if I didnt have her as a part of the family? Would it be weird for her if I did? O god im sorry I just started pouring my heart out sorry if its so long or confusing.

I understand that some children need dummies, my parents swore I wouldn't have one after the trouble they had with my 2 older brothers. That is, until 4am one morning when my Dad ended up having to drive 40km to get one so I would finally go to sleep.   I just get annoyed when parents automatically give their baby a dummy rather than attempt to comfort or entertain them in another way first.   Anyone else share this opinion?

20090220200831AAXy7sH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Re-occurring Diaper Rash?	My son (17 months) has had a diaper rash off and on for the past 3 months. It just wont seem to go away. I'm doing everything I'm suppose to. I change him frequently (even in the middle of the night, my husband or myself wakes up to change him). I use wet cotton balls instead of wipes when his rash is really bothering him. I let him air dry after a bath. I put diaper rash cream. I dont know what else to do! I've tried every diaper rash cream on the shelf (currently using beaudoux's butt paste). Nothing is working! His rash right now is small bumps around his anus, red/dry/flaky sploches around his butt cheeks and under his scrotum. He occasionally gets some really tiny spots that bleed. The doctor has given me some ointment but it didnt do much. Is this really a rash or could it be something else like a yeast infection? If so, what can I do to help it heal? HELP!  I'm running out of options. I dont want to see my son in pain anymore.
20090220202048AAe1U85	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	21 month old and daycare?	Hi! I recently started working and my son is going into daycare for the first time. I've been home with him since birth and he's never really stayed with anyone else, so he's having trouble adjusting. I found a good daycare facility that a friend uses and went and checked it out. His teacher seems really sweet and the director was nice. So all that checks out. Since I am new to this experience (first child), I asked the second in command to the director what was the best way to leave on the first day? What would be the best way for my son? She told me to drop him off, tell him bye and to have a good day and then just leave. She said that children adjust well and that he might be upset for a few days but he'll be fine. She said that is the easiest way for the child. Does anyone(knowledgeable) agree? I thought it sounded kind of mean. My son is kind of timid and attached to my hip, so I didn't think he would like it. Friday was his first day. I decided to follow the woman's advice because I thought, well she has more experience in the matter than me. Me and my husband went brought him to class, introduced him to the teacher. We stayed for maybe ten mintutes, said our good byes and then left. He didn't cry when we left because he didn't watch us leave. However, when we picked him up later the teacher told us that he cried most of the day. (which broke my heart). When my son first spotted me he cried(because he was so happy to see me) and ran to me. He clung to me like he was afraid that he was never going to see me again. I guess what I'm asking is: Is there a better way to do this? Did I go about this the wrong way? What the second in command right? Should I have eased him into daycare by staying longer with him? Is it normal for him to cry most of the day?

I went to the doctor today and they done a lengthy ultrasound and discovered that my amniotic fluid was low. The doctor said it should was 6.24 and that if it went below 5 then she would induce labor. I have been staying really hydrated and resting a lot but she told me to do it twice as much. I am going back in 2 days for another ultrasound and to be monitored. The baby weighs 4.8 lbs right now. The doc told me that I should have a hospital bag ready every time I come to the office because it could be any day depending on what my body does. Has anyone had this before? Will my fluids probably go up on there own or will i more than likely be giving birth with in the next couple of weeks? Thanks in advance.

My wifes son is 12 and his real father has only seen him a handfull of times in 12 years. The real father has no parental rights and does not want anything to do with my stepson. My wife and my stepson both want me to adopt him and I would consider it an incredible honor. I want to know how I would go about adopting him. Will it cost a lot of money? What are the requirements for me to be able to adopt him? I would really appreciate any info on this thank you.

I feel horrible the very instant after I do it but it always seems to happen again.  It's not all the time but I would rather it be not at all.  My husband works and I am a stay at home mom.  I feel so trapped sometimes.  I don't hardly ever leave the house.  I love my little girl so much and hate that I do this.  Some days I have so much patience and other days none at all.  I would never hurt her but I don't want to damage her by doing this.  I am for the most part very loving.  We sing, dance, play with toys, ect.  It's just by the end of the day or when she has been really fussy and refusing to take naps I lose my cool and yell.  I have other issues from my past that I think are causing me to be a little depressed but I can't afford a therapist.  I just feel stuck.  Any one else react this way?  I don't want my baby to fear me.

I noticed that instead of answering a question they'll give their opinion like wow that was stupid, that's not answering the question that's being rude to someone you (A) don't know and (b) came for advice.      I noticed a question about a 12 year old wearing a thong. Now although I don't promote it I would never tell her she was going to end up being those girls who sleep around. She's 12 and you are disrespectful you answer the question is a nicer way. I found that really sad that someone would say that to a 12 year old. If they are reading this know you need to grow up and get a life and not tell a 12 year old she's going to be a slut.      Anyway I'm ready for your ignorant comments. Tell me what you think.

Laura (4 weeks old) is nursing every three hours during the day now, but still every two (and sometimes one) hour at night.  It isn't that bad now, but eventually it's going to be tiresome.  Should I try to change her pattern somehow or does this usually change on its own?      Don't say sleep when baby sleeps b/c I can't make my 16 month old sleep during the day and stay up all night :)
20090220190906AACgMxj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	3 year old daughter's first ever bed?	Hi there, well I was about to order a single day bed for my almost 3 year old daughter's old bed, but then my friend and her husband who bought this bed and found it too low, suggested I used it for my daughter as it is low to the ground.    http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/ca...    and it's double which is a bonus so will last her forever!   Only problem is it doesn't go with her bedroom designs..but I could probably do something about that.      What is the overall bed like for a 3 year old girl..my friend is throwing it out so I might as well have it, even if I just shove it in the spare rooms, but I could use it for my daughter possibly?   Thanks in advance!

20090220183124AAGhLMz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Umbilical Hernia - Anyone had one?	When I went to my OBGYN for my annual exam my dr said that I have an umbilical hernia (belly button). It is not very big, there is a small bulge in my belly button (not noticeable unless you look very close) however since I just had a baby in August I figured my belly button just hadnt gone all the way back in. My dr said that he didnt think it was urgent to get operated on just yet but he advised me if I lift something heavy or cough or sneeze hard there could be a complication and would need emergency surgery.   My questions to anyone who has had one or knows about these:   How urgent is having the surgery? How severe is the operation? I have a 6 month old and would need to do heavy planning before going out of commission at all.   How would another pregnancy affect the hernia if it is not operated on?   What if I had the surgery and got pregnant again, would it just tear it again? (I have only had one pregnancy and was pretty thin before the pregnancy if that matters)   Also, is it ok to do crunches with one? I was working on an exercise program to get my body back in shape and dont want to do anything that would make it worse. Any advice?

I have tried so hard to wean him off it but he just doesnt seem to like pasterised milk.    I have tried other forms of milk (soya milk) but he doesnt seem to like that either.   I have also tried adding Nestle milkshake (strawberry and chocolate flavour!) but he finds it revolting!      I have discussed it with my health visitor but she keeps telling me to try harder...

It is not an option to stop breastfeeding, but it hurts so bad I cry every time he latches on and my nipples bleed.     Also does anyone know of anything that would help with the nipple pain?   Thanks.

She is always happy to go to school, but as soon as I turn to leave, she is in a sobbing fit and grabbing hold of my leg. EVERY TIME. It's embarrassing, because other mothers simply kiss their kids goodbye and walk out while watching "crazy mom and daughter".

20090220181711AAaHzO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do these things in the adolescent section annoy you too?	I rarely come on here, but when I do I notice some things, mainly in this section.  It really annoys me when...      1. People will ask a question then say something like "star if you like purple" or "star if recognize me".  I hate that, people should get stars because they had a good question, not because they asked for one.        2. There seem to be users on here who are friends, that's fine, but they talk about it so much! One of them will ask a question, and then the one answering will say "Oh, I love you! [insert inside joke nobody else gets here]! I love talking to you!" I think it's fine to have friends on here, it's great actually, but that shouldn't impact who gets best answers.       3. All the pregnant teens.  I take that back, not all of them, some seem like they could be a parent.  But most don't.  And the ones that are afraid to tell their parents, HELLO you are having a baby, if you can't tell your parents, you're clearly not ready to have a child.      4. The trolls, there are so many of them!      5. Asking a question that isn't even a question, just a statement.        6. The parents on here who answer meanly.         Those are just some thing's I have noticed, and I was wondering if I was the only one who saw these as bad things.  If you don't agree, that's fine, I would still like to hear your opinions and reasoning.  Maybe I'm getting annoyed at these things too easily, but it's just what I have noticed.  Thanks everyone!
20090220181827AAR7qlA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 16 month old will  NOT listen?	My daughter refuses to listen, she knows right from wrong, I can tell she does. She knows when she is doing something wrong because the second I catch her she stops. Mostly she is in the trash can or with my cell phone (which she threw in the trash a few times) I know that is mainly my fault because I taught her to throw things in the trash. I know at this age, she isn't smart enough to realize the real meaning but she does know. I do believe in spanking, not with a belt or anything that even leaves a mark, usually a pop on the hand and a stiff NO NO works well. Now she's started to hit and finds in funny, something her father taught her and approves of. I'm not sure how else to punish. I do the time out chair, and I do pop every now and again, and it seems effective, for five mintues.

20090220184844AACrmhs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you think I'm pregnant?	I don't know whether or not I'm pregnant, and I'm scared.      My periods are pretty irregular in a regular way. I usually start my cycle 4 weeks after it ends, and they last about a week with light bleeding for up to 10 days sometimes. So the date changes by around a week everytime. I have been really late before, up to 2 weeks, but for some reason this time feels different.      As of now, I'm guessing I'm a couple days late, but I can never really be sure. My boyfriend and I have had sex once in the last month, and it was in what I guesstimate to be the last week of my cycle.      I'm getting cramps every now and then, which usually happens a day or two before I get my period. It's been 3 days now. My breasts are sore, but I also experience that sometimes before my period. I can't really tell if my areolas are bigger. Sometimes I think that might just be my imagination after I read it because I hadn't noticed anything about them until I read that symptom. One night, and only one, I remember getting up in the middle of the night to pee 3 times. I know more frequent urination is a symptom but it hasn't happened any other time since. I have not had any morning sickness, or gotten sick after eating. No aversion to smells. I have gained weight, but that could very well be because I recently quit a sports team that I have been on for over 10 years. I'm not breaking out. I have trouble sleeping, but I'm also an insomniac to begin with so that doesn't point to anything. No lower back pain.         Am I just stressing myself out over nothing or could I be pregnant? I'm hesitant to tell my boyfriend because I don't want to freak him out. I'm also too embarassed to go buy a pregnancy test and don't want to waste money going to the doctor just because I feel like I could be pregnant.      Any advice? Has this ever happened to you?

Parents: What is the average amount you have received on gift cards for you baby shower? I ordered a Visa gift card online and put $50 on it, but I'm afraid $50 is not enough...    None Parents: Please give your opinion on a decent amount for a gift card.       Note: She is not my best friend, she's just a friend if that helps.       Also, is it tacky to open a gift you plan to give? I purchased a baby picture frame to go with the gift card, but I wanted to put the gift card inside the spot where the picture would go just to be unique, rather than give it in an envelope. The way the package is for the picture frame, I would have to remove the original taping and re-tape it after placing the card in it. Do you think it's tacky to open the package and re-tape it back? Or should I just put the gift card in an envelope and leave the picture frame package in its original, intact condition? Please give me your honest opinion! Thanks in advance!

20090220194129AA0OLDj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you feel about kids under 10 watching horror movies?	My cousin's little girl watches the Exorcist and thinks it is funny. She is 5. He also has 2 other kids ages 8 and 10 and they all watch really scary movies like the Grudge and The ring. They have no problems with nightmares and their parents say as long as there in no cussing, nudity or sexual content there is no problem. That is not the only things they watch of course, they watch the Hannah Montana, and whatever else kids watch, but those movies scare me and I am an adult.

(correct me if im wrong)      so she starts dating this guy after her kid is a year or two old.. and naturally the man asks where the babies father is. she told him the truth, that she had gone to a sperm bank and the father was a donor. he was amazed and told her that he had donated sperm a few years back and how he hoped it helped make some woman very happy. i guess they stayed together for awhile, and after the child got older (5-6 years old) both she and her boyfriend noticed that her son looked a lot like her boyfriend. they actually got SO curious that they had a paternity test done, and BINGO!!!      boyfriend that she just came across a year or two after having her baby actually turned out to be the sperm donor, the baby's father!!

20090220201734AAwf3WR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I asked this somewhere else got no response-Why doesn't my brother see the big deal in this?	Okay my SIL has 4 children 13,12,7,2 and I have only 1 and she's 2.5 Well there's been 2 occasions where i have been at her house and my daughter has found medicine.       Like I went to the bathroom and came out while she was playing in my nephews room took a peek and she was counting aspirin on his bed!!!!! I was furious that she was able to even get ahold of it so i screamed at my SIL and she said her son (13 yr old) mustv'e have left it down and that she couldn't believe my daughter could work the child proof cap open. Now I had to watch over her so closely all day hoping she didn't eat any after inspecting her mouth etc. she seems very happy and normal so I didn't contact anyone but would have if something seemed off.       So thats 1 time not even a week later I was over there sitting down in the kitchen while she was playing in there on the chalkboard behind me and she comes over and says medicine mommy and has a bottle of Robotussin OPENED!!!!!! I'm like WTH where did she get that from low and behold my SIL apparently keeps her medicine down on a shelf thats about 3 1/2 ft high right behind the chalkboard and my SIL insists my daughter can open childproof caps and even if she could (which I doubt) why the hell does she keep her medicine so low with her own baby walking around??       I took the first case as an accident but now I think she just is not thinking. So I tried to discretely bring this up to my brother just so he knew and maybe he could convince her to put medicine where it belonged up high in a cabinet!!! But he got mad at me and said she has 4 kids and they're all alive so you need to lighten up. LIGHTEN UP???? My daughter could've injested medicine twice while at their home and I need to relax or lighten up. And there's no big deal with the medicine being at childs reach??       Can someone please tell me I am not crazy for being upset over this and that I am right for thinking this is absurd to have medicine that low. Because I am in shock that I am the one who is supposedly the idiot here.

20090220202241AAaqjwJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How long could this take?	My fiance and I have decided we would like a child, so I have stopped taking my BCPS(its been over a month now), I have started taking prenatal vitamins, and I have stopped the occasional smoking and drinking. We arent actively trying to have a baby, but we are also not not trying to have a baby (if that makes sense). I keep track of my cycles so I know when I am most fertile and we dont use condoms, he sometimes pulls out and sometimes doesnt. We are both young and healthy and he already has a 3 year old from a previous relationship. He is a smoker but has cut down a TON and has promised me he will stop when I become pregnant :). So my question is, based on this how long should it take to become pregnant? I was on the pill for almost a year and a half.

She's chosen such a hard road, but it's not the end of the world.   3. She's screwed up her life.   4. I'll bet her parents are raising her child.   5. She must have very permissive parents.   6. I wouldn't let my teenage daughter have that baby in a million years.   7. She's young, but she looks like a good mother.   8. Why wouldn't she have given that baby up for adoption.   9. I don't blink an eye when I see teenaged parents anymore.   10. I wonder if the baby's father is involved.   11. I wonder if this happened because this young girl doesn't have a father.   12. I hope she has a lot of support because she's going to need it.      All of the above. None of the above. Thoughts of your own.

Also, just the last couple of days my lower back has been killing me!!!   I took a test last Saturday and it was negative, so I don't know if I should take another test now, wait, or just accept that AF is on its way.    I've looked on lots of websites to see their early pregnancy symptoms, but I want to know what real people's experiences were.

I was wondering how many other people came from families in which smoking was common and accepted for all ages. My parents used to let me light me light their cigarettes and gave me puffs when I was 4 or 5. Sometimes my dad would smoke cigars, and he would pass it to my mom and me and we would help him smoke it.   My husband and I do this now with our girls. We let them smoke cigarettes as soon as they asked, and tonight we have been passing around a big Macanudo. The girls and I are still smoking our cigarettes, but passing the cigar with him too. It is a fun family activity that we all enjoy. And we have never told the girls that most people don't inhale cigars, so they take big puffs and inhale them like it is no big deal.    Does anyone else do this?

My daughter is in second grade and struggling.She did fine through kindergarten and last year she started falling behind,I allowed the school to put her in special ed for math and reading so she could get some extra help,about 2 hours per day.Now,they're telling me she needs more help or she's going to fail.The problem is I dont see anything wrong with her,in her home life she's a normal little girl and as far as school work goes,they say she's progressing but not fast enough.For example they have 25 question math tests daily and she can answer them all correctly but they want her to do it in 60 seconds.The school has suggested she might have ADD but wouldnt she show some kind of signs at home?I think some of the problem is that she's really shy and wont ask questions when she doesnt understand but it seems to me every child isnt goin to learn at the same rate and they just want to put all the kids not up to their standard in special ed.Her confidence has diminished because her teacher has told her she's failing,now she says she's stupid.What could be wrong with her that I'm not seeing?HELP!!!!!!!

20090220202917AAPJwSO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Want to know how my daughter won a pageant?	My girlfriend made her dress. The bodice was burgandy velvet and the skirt which was attached right at the hip was a toile(?) a peachy burgandy pearly colored cute material. It also wrapped around the shoulders with a med sized velvet burgandy rose right in the center. She wore white gloves and white socks with plain black patten leather shoes. Needless to say, she didn't win best dressed.....lol..... As a matter of fact a woman walked up to me and said "this is your first pageant isn't it?" As I was blushing and shaking my head yes she explained she could tell by the fact that I had ommitted makeup and hairspray from my daughters appearance.       I bent down on one knee and looked at my 6 year old in her big oval doe eyes and said "Now baby, this is just for fun. If you don't win anything it is Ok by me because you are beautiful right here" And I poked at her heart. She shrugged her shoulders cuz I don't think she really cared to begin with.This was something we had never done and it was just a fluke that we decided to do it in the first place. So, she took her long blondish brown hair that went down past her back and ended in a tight natural wringlet at the back of her knees and walked up on stage with all the other girls in their rolled and teased hair with their fancy pageant dresses and made up faces and stood proudly right next to them.       We kept making faces at one another as if we were saying..."oh geesh we messed this up really good." She shrugged her shoulders at me one time when the girls trophy for best dressed and Little Miss Valetine towered over her little trophy. It was kinda funny but I did feel a littel sorry for her.      There were over 150 girls in this contest between 0-18. All of a sudden they began calling out my daughters name. The following is what she won:   Little Miss Mardi Gra   Little Miss ( city )   Miss (county) Sweetheart   The most photogenic (mind you NO makeup)      and then she was given the coveted title of the most beautiful out of all the contestants between the ages of 0-18.       She one a total of six trophy's and 5 crowns and banners....she was Little Miss Valentine's runner up (the small trophy she received).      I was told by a few of the mothers and even one of the pageant hostesses, before the pageant started, that I would eventually learn how to prepare my daughter for a pageant. I honestly had several mothers show their sympathy for me and my daughter, making us feel some what out of place.       When the pageant was over I went to a few of the judges and asked them why my daughter had won so many titles when she looked so different. The answer was the same from all of the judges......      "Because she looked like a little girl."      We will never do that again....the pressure was terrible. The little girls looked miserable before the went on stage. Afterwards, many cried and many mothers were angry with their daughters.       I can tell you for a FACT that my daughter and I would NEVER do it again.       My daughter said it wasn't that fun anyway.

20090220204849AAFteZK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does your baby cry in his/her sleep....particulary "older babies"?	Lilah is 7 months and for a while now (probably around a month or two) she cries in her sleep.  Sometimes it's more whimpering/crying, but she doesn't wake up.  But sometimes she will start crying in her sleep and then wake up wailing but as soon as I put the paci back in her mouth she will go to sleep.  These "espisodes" will only last a few to ten minutes at the most, but like I said most of the time she doesn't wake up, she just cries in her sleep.  I guess I thought it was normal and that she was just dreaming (this is my first baby @ 28).  We are temporarily staying at my mothers house as of 2 days ago since we are in the middle of a move and she noticed it and asked me if she always does this.  She does it just about every night once or twice in the begining (she goes down at 7ish and wakes at 7ish) around 10 or 11 and doesn't do it the rest of the night.  She doesn't think it's normal so here I am freaking out.        So I guess my question is, does you baby do this?  I guess I thought she was just having a bad dream or something.  Which I guess doesn't make a whole lot of sense b/c she is ALWAYS happy.  She doesn't have any teeth yet and I don't really see any signs of them besides drooling excessively and gnawing on EVERYTHING lol, so I don't "think" it's teething.  I have no idea why she does this.  But other than that, she sleeps like a log the rest of the night.  Anybody with similar experiences????

Does anyone else ever wonder out of the millions and millions of abortions done since Roe vs. Wade, could the person who would have cured AIDS or cancer (any kind or many kinds) have been aborted? Do you think it is a real possibility that so many diseases may have already been cured had they gotten the chance to live?      It saddening to my heart to think about all those babies who have been killed and what kind of wonderful things they might have done with their lives given the chance to have them.

20090203093117AAUV9AV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What should i feed skinny baby?	my son is 5 months. he has been exclusively breastfed. was gaining weight & growing well (meeting milestones, very active & strong), but started to slow btwn 2-4 months & barely grew from 4-5 months (height & weight).  he was 8 lb 4 oz @ birth & is now 12 lb 4 oz, 24 3/4 in.  doc said to start solids, (at 4 months she said stick w/just breastmilk til 6 months as that will help him grow faster than anything) now she says she's seen cases where breastfed babies stop growing then take off again when solids are introduced.        he has actually stared nursing MORE sice starting solids, but i don't want to fill his belly w/low cal foods.  he's eating sweet potatos mixed w/breastmilk & i will start avocado in a couple days- what are some other good high-cal/fat early foods?

20090220212749AAp4WSQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Boyfriend Issues during Pregnancy?	I have been dating the same guy for a year and a half. For the first nine months of our relationship, we had no issues whatsoever. However, since that point we have fought somewhat (without breaking up). I have been under the impression that we love one another, and I do love him, but lately he's been acting a little weird.      He gets frustrated with me and will tell me that he can't stand being around me and he wants to break up with me and he never thinks we will work.      However, he ALWAYS follows up with this either later the same day or the next day or two telling me that he loves me and he knows he's horrible to me and he's trying to get better.       We don't have a lot in common personality wise, but we do/did enjoy each other's company. Normally, I'd just break up with him and be done, but we're expecting a baby in May, so the issue is a little more tricky. Has anyone else ever had this happen to them? I'm unsure of what he means, and would love a guy's perspective (or an experienced female's!). What is the truth here?      Could he be stressed about having a baby?  We're 22 years old so on the younger side.  He also has drug issues, but is working on eliminating them.  He's cut back significantly in the last two months.
20090220205651AAanGur	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I feel  bad that I don't want to babysit this kid anymore...?	So today I babysat an 8 year old kid.      I went to the store beforehand to get him a toy if he was good. I got him a mystery hot wheel (you couldn't see what was inside) and from "cars" the movie a magnetic scene with characters, I also got another mystery hot wheel for his brother who was not going to be there for today because he was going somewhere else. I was only going to give it to him if he was on his best behaviour.      I am not the person who sits on a couch while I "watch" the kid. I like to play with them what they want to play. So the first hour and 15 minutes to hour and a half went great: we played basketball, wii, monopoly, and board games.       Before mom left: He threw two of his cats hard on the ground, one hit the ground on her back. Luckily the kitten wasn't around at that time. He also told him when mom says "are you going to behave?" or something, he said "no or i';ll shoot myself in the eye"  something like that. His brother also said "now, don't run away this time." He has a running away reputation, with and without a babysitter.       During that time: He was watching an extremely bad movie that is suited for 18+ or older. He was playing a rated T game, he kept calling himself stupid and an idiot, he was saying how he hated his school.       After that time I guess he didn't like me anymore and he wanted me to leave his room and leave. So I went and sat on the couch and called T, who I found out watched them with her aunt and told me that he they had horrible language (f bomb..), yelled, screamed, made babysitter do things, threw cats...      Around 15 minutes later and was hungry. I thought before the parents left they would have fed him dinner, but he said they didn't. He asked me to make him some of the breakfast things (I don't know the name of them) and was angry because he couldn't find the syrup. He yelled at me to find it for a minute, I ignored it. I made him the toaster thing and he was like "what you don't know how to use the toaster?" I was like "yes I do, but maybe not your one. You can show me how." so I made him the food and put it on a plate for him and brought it to him (he made me do that) I wish I didn't and had made him come get it now, because: after i brought that to him he yelled back from his room and was like "GET ME A KNIFE ITS IN BLAH BLAH BLAH DRAWER OPEN THEM TILL YOU FIND THE KNIFES"       I got him it and brought ot to his room and said "you have legs, why don't you go get it next time." he said "I can't."    He then yelled back "GET ME A FORK THEY"RE WHERE THE KNIVES ARE"    I was like "no you come get it"   he said "NO YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!"    so I guess I gave in and brought it to him.      I was feeling sad already because I wanted ot be able to babysit and have a good time with the kids already and he didn't want to let that happen.      So, dad comes home. Dad asks me how it went and I told him "eh..few problems here and there....." he was like "what was it, tell me" I said "he through the cats hard to the ground, the two bigger ones" the dad yells to the kid to come and the kid lies about it saying he didn't do it, which it was RIGHT INFRONT OF ME when he did it and I saw it, I saw the cats being thrown hard to the ground and one didnt get to his feet fast enough. I told him as well "making me do things, not doing it for himself..." but that was it, really.... so I left.      I want to email his mother some suggestions, I am in utter shock of how rude he was.       I want to suggest to the mother that maybe allow the child [make] to invite one or two people over from school to play with because he says he has no friends. I also want to suggest is that they limit what he can and cannot watch such as limmit to only disney/cartoon network and no adult stations. Also I want to suggest is they go through his video games and store away the T and M games. And maybe get him therapy due to his poor self-esteem which they told me about, and his anger issues against his brother and himself and cats.       I don't know, I feel so bad yet i am so upset and angry about what happened.
20090203094534AAsmDAn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Donated blood... + HPT this morning?	I've been TTC for 5 months. To make a long story short, I'm sick of denying myself of the things I want to do b/c I "could be pregnant" when I'm not even sure that I am. One of those things was giving blood. I did it for the first time yesterday. I just donated 1 bag (they said it was about 4 cups).      I'm at CD 24 now & should get my period on Saturday. I went to the dollar tree around 11am and bought 2 tests. I only took one. It looked like a very pale line, but I'm not even sure... maybe I was just seeing things. The lights in my bathroom are dim, so I took it near a window & could see it there (VERY light).       I'm so impatient! Should I test again in the morning w/ my other test or wait until Saturday or Sunday? Could giving blood be why it was so light (if that's what it was)?

20090203093702AAUJKz9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Okay, is this too bad of a name?	We are always trying to figure out what we are going to name our daughter, her due date is April 23rd, and one day my 3 year old son said why don't we name her sweet pea. I though that was very sweet, but I would never give my daughter the name sweet pea but that is what we call her now since we haven't chosen a name. My fiance also says lets just name her sweet pea. I won't use it as a first name for obvious reasons, and the only first name that we have kind of agreed on in April, so we are thinking of naming her April Sweetpea. What do you think? Also, I'm not set on April, but I don't really care for super common names, I would really love something unheard of but beautiful.

20090203091443AAKqvg7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Recent study saying codeine is not suitable for breastfeeding Mums?	OK, so I was given codeine after my c-section 6 months ago (and also oral morphine I think) Apparently (some websites) now refer to a study saying it is not suitable for breastfeeding mums.      I have an incredibly painful shoulder/back right now and have some codeine (cocodamol 30/500 tabs) in the house.      Some people say it depends on the age of your child and the strength of the tablets.      So my question is, would short term, limited (bare minimum to get by) use of co-codamol 30/500 be safe while breastfeeding a 6 month old?      Also I have heard that Diclofenac (an anti inflammatory NSAID) is safe while b'feeding but can't find any studies to back this up - does anybody know if this is OK as the combination of these two drugs is what I have previoulsy been prescribed for a similar shoulder problem.      Thanks

20090203091746AApIR8b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you socialize with the parents of a mean kid?	Very close friends of ours (our child`s godparents) have a son a few months older that my oldest. We have always had the kids play together. And, enjoyed the adult time as well. But, this child has anger issues. Everything he does results in tears, fights, and tantrums (physically). Even when disciplining his parents have to restrain him.      I always hear complaints from my son that the other child has pushed him or hit him. My son will tell his parents who brush it off and say oh that wasn`t nice. Sorry. This happens every time they are together (at mass or just in a social setting). This last week the boys got loose (parents helping at church) and my husband went to collect the kids. This boy would NOT listen. There were others who were trying to pray and he was screaming shouting mean things and bit my husband numerous times.       I feel he violant. He won`t play nice (ie share toys). It seems like a fight with the kids every time we get together. I enjoy the parents but the kid is questionable. My husband doesn`t want to socialize outside of church for this reason, he said why do it when the boys will just fight and the whole evening will just be chaos. I have to agree. So, dinner is off.      I wish things were different and am wondering what others would do.      (For refrence the boy in question is 4, mine is 3)

There is no way to contact him in person because we don't go to the same school anymore. I see him .. well people that look like him everywhere and its making the whole "getting over your crush" thing alot more difficult then i expected.. people say "if he likes you he would of said so" BUT i was always with my friends and every opportunity he did make an effort but i was joking around and didn't take it seriously.. i ignored him basically.. and this was when i did go to his school.       SO i have his number and i want to call him.. would it be weird if i called him? its his home phone.. sadly he does not have a face book or myspace so calling him is my only option. I also think he tried to contact me because i saw a car that looked like his in my driveway and he rang the doorbell.. i didn't answer cause i was nervous if it actually really turned out to be him.. he hasn't come by since.       but anyways should i call him and IF i do call him what should i say? what if he has a girlfriend or something?? im so nervous i know i have nothing to loose but.. i don't want him to be creeped out.. i guess i was always nervous he would be creeped out even in person lol but ya..       should i? its been a year since i seen him!! i dated this one guy but i kept thinking about him all the time!!      I did run into him recently and we locked eyes.. all the feelings came back to me and I know he felt the same way.. i did walk away though and i hope he didnt take it the wrong way.. it was just to painful to look at him.. hes perfect.

20090203091328AA8lWAc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Ways to help 4year old get prepared to go to PreK?	My daughter is 4years old and has NEVER left my side.  I've been a stay at home mom from day 1.  She is extremely attached to me.  Where we live neighbors are far and few so she doesn't really have any kids her own age to play with.  The only people she ever really spends time with are family, the youngest being 13 years old.  So she's more into hanging out with older kids.  Everytime I even MENTION her going to school she gets furious and says "Mommy!  Please stop telling me that!"  I try to tell her about playing with kids, and coloring, and reading stories, and learning and she gets excited...until she realizes I wont be there.  I have reassured over over and over that I WILL be back and i would NEVER not pick her up.  But she's still scared.  What else can I do to prepare her for PreK?  She will definately be going.  I think it is important for her, especially for socialization reasons.  I have decided to start letting her pick out some supplies she will need and get her some brand new clothes to start getting her excited...she picked out a back pack that I now have to order online.  What else should i do?
20090203091518AA8vkVw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am I pregnant? Too scared to test!?	I got my LMP on 1/2/09   I ovulated on the 21-23 (not 100% sure which day it was) and right after Ovulation for about 4 days, I got light cramping. I got 2 positive ovulation tests and a temp rise to follow.    At 8 & 9 dpo I got lower temps and 9 dpo I actually started to spot a few times when I wiped, then again on 10 dpo. I was for sure my period was coming since spotting a few days before is normal for me. Last night I got an increase of wet CM and menstrual like cramps and for sure thought I was done. I woke up this morning and took my temp and it was still high!! It was 98.4. The last 4-5 days have created a 3rd shift since I got the spotting.    I'm too nervous to test until after my period is due! I haven't really had any symptoms, just the normal breast tenderness and feeling a little sick (not sure if it's due to the fact that I have a sore throat)....      So all in all, do you think i could be pregnant?

After i had my first i was on cloud nine, totally in baby heaven, i instantly bonded and loved every minute of being a new mom.  Recently two women told me that they felt like that with their first but with their second they got depressed and had a hard time bonding with their second.   Now i am worried, i was feeling really excited about the baby, i have obviouse nervousness about the stress of having two and how my 2 year old will handle it but generally i was feeling good about the baby coming.  For those that have two or more kids, did you experience depression or upset after the birth of your second or did you feel good? is this common? or is it just a coincedence that these two people told me that.   i know that everyone is different but i am hoping to hear that this is not the common trend and that others had good experiences.

20090203095211AA562Ux	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm pregnant with fraternal triplets!?	My husband and I just found out that we're having triplets. Twins run in my family, but not triplets.      Did you have a multiple pregnancy or know anyone who has? What was it like for you or for that person? Is it possible to have a multiple birth where it's natural? It took me ages to recover from a C-section I had when I was pregnant with my son.      Thank you...

20090203093253AA8qWgb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	17 week old sleeping pattern!?	My baby slept through the night from 9pm to 7.30am from 7 weeks.  Now she is 16 weeks, and has suddenly decided not to bother any more!  She now seems to wake about 10 minutes after we put her to bed...a 10 minute cuddle usually gets her back to sleep.  Then she could wake at any time of the night...could be 11.30pm, or 5.30am.  There is always full proper crying too!  I am breastfeeding, and often take the easy option and let her feed which usually sends her back to sleep!  She only naps during the day if we are out in the car or buggy!  Have tried leaving her to cry...half an hour later she was so upset I lifted her.  Any advice appreciated!
20090203093734AAV9f21	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	IS it possible to have stronger period symptoms after trying to conceive?	OK I have NEVER in my 24 years of life had any type of back pain, or cramping before my period. Now we tried to conceive and I am having these symptoms plus Horribly tender breast and I am due for my period Friday or Saturday. I am obviously hoping I am pregnant but I am hearing that it could be my period. Is it possible to have these symptoms for the first time ever be related to my period or is it more likely since this has never happened that I would be pregnant. I have taken a test although I know it is 2 early and it said negative! PLease help!

20090220205606AA8I1Su	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How accurate is an u/s for dating?	I went in for my first ultrasound today =) It was AMAZING but I was just wandering about a couple things. First, I was wondering how accurate is u/s for dating how many weeks you are? I thought I was 11w4d but I measured 12w4d... I am really 12w4d? The women doing the u/s said my DR could tell me for sure. Also during the entire sonogram, my lower right back was killing me, Honestly I almost wanted to stop because I was in a lot of pain laying down. Once I got up it was much better. I have these two bumps in my lower back, not tumors. They said it was fat deposits a few yrs back that cause me pain every so often. I was just wondering if this was something I should bring up to my DR on my next app.?
20090220210633AA94QoJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can being sick make you have high blood pressure?	I am 35 wks pregnant and went to the midwife today because my allergies have been draining a lot and it gave me an ear infection that I've had for 3 days but I've been boiling it out with peroxide. She checked my blood pressure and it's 140/90. She told me modified bed rest until Monday morning we will do a bp check and hope it's just me being sick making it high. Can being sick really be what's behind it? Has that happened to anyone else? I'm scared now I'm going to be on bedrest not that I have any problem with it. You ask my husband he tell you I been on bedrest the past 9 months. (Yeah right)

20090220210915AAxyrLG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Should we test again?	My wife got ovulation with the help of fertility medication. Then the doctor finally gave an HCG shot. she ovulated somewhere around 30th to 1st feb. Doctor also gave progesterone intra virginal for hormonal support. Her period was due for 14th feb which never happened. we thought may be she is pregnant. As per doctor's suggestion we did the test today in the morning and it came back negative. Now im confused. Definitely she ovulated, she is not pregnant then why she is not getting her period. Do you think we should do a test again? Is there still a possibility that she is pregnant. She is also not getting much of pregnancy symptoms only a bit back pain and she said she feels something in her breast. She is quite upset with the test too. What should we do now?

I know that progesterone is a hormone that prepares the lining of the uterus to nourish a fertilized egg. Do you need progesterone for a period to start? And if you do and don't have regular periods does that mean that you won't be able to have kids or that it will just be harder to conceive?

I normally buy one of the more expensive brands of diapers, but last week cash flow was a bit strained so I went with Parent's Choice. A couple of days ago, my daughter got a blister in her pelvic area and now it has spread! From the research I have done, it is not staph infection. She's going to the doctor tomorrow, but I would still like to know if anyone has had similar experiences with these diapers.

So I have been putting him on the wedge to keep him in one spot, he's 3 months old.  He hasn't gotten out of it, but is bad to put him in it?   Will it stop him from learning to roll?  Is there any risks to using the wedge for too long?

20090203094855AAGbqCh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Questions about Pregnancy Anger?	I don't know how to deal with my anger right now.  I am currently two months pregnant, but I do not remember having anger issues while pregnant with my two older children.      Right now, I am so furious all the time that I want to break things and throw things and scream.  I cry constantly.  I am, in short, a miserable piece of crap.      I'm just not sure how much of it is to do with pregnancy horomones, and how much is other issues.  I am sure that it is partly do to with the stress of working 60 hour work weeks every week, knowing that I will be ineligible for maternity benefits because I am self-employed, having to put wedding plans on hold, financial stress, short and dark winter days and not getting out in the sunlight at all, a filthy house due to lack of time and energy to clean it and no time for hobbies or friends anymore.        I guess I am wondering if anyone else had problems with their anger while pregnant, and did it resolve?  Or am I actually just turning into a horrible, angry person?

I went back to work when my daughter was 6 weeks old and I had been pumping during the day and making enough to last her the following day at Grandma's. I was nursing in the evenings and on weekends but then around 12 weeks old she was sick and would not breast feed during the evenings after work or that following weekend.     Now 5 weeks later she is still refusing to breast feed in the evening or she will for a few minutes and then get really fussy and keep pulling off. Any tips to get her to breast feed in the evenings also?     I would like to continue breastfeeding but I really dread pumping and now I seem to be making less when I pump. Would it be possible to just breast feed during the night if I cut down pumping from 3-4 times per day to just once per day?     I worry that I may dry up completely.     THANKS!

20090220220002AAr3Tvs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Fetal Dopplers, did you research them?	I've been thinking about this since I was pregnant. Do women using these things know how dangerous they may be to their babies? I was going to get one, but after doing some research, I decided there was no way I was gonna use them. So, did you research them, or assume that just because they were being sold, that they were safe?      And I quote from a reliable government site:   " "Although there are no known risks of ultrasound imaging and heartbeat monitors, the radiation associated with them can produce effects on the body," says Robert Phillips, Ph.D., a physicist with FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). "When ultrasound enters the body, it heats the tissues slightly. In some cases, it can also produce small pockets of gas in body fluids or tissues." "   " "When the product is purchased over the counter and used without prior consultation with a health care professional, there is no oversight of how the device is used and little or no medical benefit derived from the exposure," Phillips says. "The number of sessions or the length of a session to which a fetus is exposed is uncontrolled, thus raising the potential for harm to the fetus." "       http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/keep...

What does the cervix feel like when pregnant?      I am 12 days past ovulation with my period due around the 26th Feb and I just felt my cervix for the first time, it was soft and felt kinda close to the opening (not too close lol) I had some mucus that was like thick white almost sticky lumps and I wasn't sure if it was normal just before your period.    I also have been having a few symptoms, not looking into it too much but hopeful :o) My breasts today have felt like someone beat me with a bat, mostly around the breasts and underarms, also when I push lightly on them they hurt....they do usually hurt before my period but it's usually just when I push on them and they start to hurt right after ovulation until I get my period. This month they only just started hurting yesterday and are very bad today.   I also have been getting waves of nausea and metallic taste in my mouth for the past few days...anyone shed some light?
20090220214525AAjwaXD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and need some suggestions on telling her catholic parents?	Ok, so I have posted several questions and I thank all of those who have posted their comments and their thoughts. I have liked some of the post and disliked some. The situation is I'm 17 and my girlfriend is 16, she's five months pregnant and we haven’t told her parents yet. Were planning on telling them through a letter because it is something that several people have suggested. So her and I put our minds together and wrote a letter and I want to know what ya'll think of it and if you think there is anything we need to add or remove. Please no nasty comments on our irresponsibility, we already know and acknowledge this and will take immediate action to fix this. Here's the letter.      "   Dear Mom,                           I love you so much and you have given me the best life I can imagine, and you know I would never intentionally want to hurt or disappoint you. I have always done the best I can to make you proud, and that's what makes this so hard. I know this is not going to be easy to read, but please read it the whole way through before you say anything. I know you are going to be disappointed but there is nothing I can do to keep you from feeling that way now. I am trying to be mature and own up to what I have done and tell you. I am trying to do what is the best for everyone. I am going to be completely honest with you.              I remember you have told both me and even Jen this and I have heard you say this on many occasions to other people. You have said that everyone has that one hard time they have to go through in their life, and you told me countless times that Jen needs someone while she is going through her time. I am going through this time in my life right now as well, and I need you to be there and support with me through.    I know your struggle was in college, when you were pregnant with a child who was not dads. I am sure you needed the support of your family and friends, and that support they gave you in what I need from you right now. I know it's not going to be easy, but it is what I need from you right now.    Gavin and I have been having safe sex for about 5 months or so now. I don't know if you knew or had any idea but just some little things that have happened have made both Gavin and me think you have known it.  Either way, you know now. I am going through the same struggle that you want through; except for the fact that you were a couple years older. I am pregnant. I know you have mentioned my jeans and shirts getting tighter, well this is the reason why. I know what we have done is wrong and irresponsible but it has happened. We need to face up to it and do what is best for this baby and everyone else.    Gavin and I have been looking at information on adoption. Not every couple can do what we have done and created. Instead of looking at it as a negative for us, we are looking at it as a positive for a different, less fortunate family. We want to help a couple who can not conceive the blessing of their own child to become loving parents. We have thought long and hard about this and we have concluded that this is going to be the best decision for everyone. I know this is what you decided on in college, and, from what I can tell, you made the right choice.    I need you now more than I have ever needed you before. I know you have a million questions running through your head and I am going to be completely honest with you when answering them. You are my role model and that's what makes all this even harder than it already is. I know you are upset and disappointed, and I realize I have been stupid and irresponsible. I know that you are going to support and help as much as you possibly can.               I love you so much,   Nicole   P.S. I'm having you find this letter because of how sensitive this situation is. I truly do not want to hurt you and that is not my intention. I love you deeply and admire all that you have done for me in the past, present, and future. I really need your support and I really would appreciate it if you could take some time to consider our decision on the adoption and to take in all the information before accessing the situation with me. I realize this is going to be very hard to comprehend and be as devastating to you as it was to us when we found out. Mom, I'm so scared and I really need you. Please don't yell at me, I'm already hurting and I don't think I could handle you yelling at me. The damage has been done, now it's time that Gavin and I become more responsible and deal with this. I love you so much mom, I may not act like it, and I may say that I hate you, but I don't, I love you and dad both very much. Please don't resent me; I need you now more than ever. You’re my favorite!   "   Again if you see anything that should be removed or added please let us know. Thank you!
20090220215517AA52A4X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My son claims that...?	His friends Mom hates him. I always tell him you are just being silly, but he always comes back to it. I fianlly just told him to be nice and stay our of her way. He said fine. Appearantly he told his friend this and his friend told his mom. His Mom called me up saying QUOTE ON QUOTE " Hi. This is Stevens mom. I just want to let you know that your son thinks I hate him, and I don't so let him know that, and um... yeah I dont hate him and ... " and no lie she went on for a good thirty seconds... ( on our answering machine) And at the end she said " Call me back!" Why should I call her back? What does she need? Should I call her back? Ugh. Help!

20090220214621AAgcVWA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My three year old is extremely sick and might die, do you know what could be wrong with him?	My three year old little boy has a fever. I have taken him to five different doctors and no one knows what is wrong or how to help. They all said that they had never seen this sickness before, but it looks like it could be really serious and possibly deadly. His symptoms are the following:   Sneezing   Coughing   fevers   throwing up   not eating   red bumps over his scin   blood shot eyes   I can't afford to lose him, he is my love and joy and my everything. Please tell me what might be wrong with him!! I am pregnant with his little sister right now, and she is due in just a month. My husband left me just after I got pregnant again and he won't help me out. Please help, please. I really need it.
20090220214353AAKWFBv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is it normal for a single mother to want to give her child away.?	I take very good care of my daughter but I have sacrificed so much to have her.  The father is absent, I can barely get anyone to watch her, and I find myself in relationships with men who try to take advantage of the fact that I have such a restricted life.  My body was ruined from having her. None of this is her fault.  I feel like I am being punished for having her.  I did not get an abortion because I thought it was the right thing to do six years ago.  I go through ups and downs because of this fact.  I am reluctant to give her away because I do not want anyone to destroy her.  I want a free life without restriction.  I feel like crap.
20090220214403AAUibXI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I politely request NO GIFTS for 4 year old's birthday party?	My daughter will be turning 4 soon and would like to have a party. We're going to keep it small this year, as all the years before have turned into too much commotion and gift gluttony.       My parents and I will be giving her gifts from us on her actual birthday - we just don't want guests to feel obligated or go to any trouble. My daughter is already quite thoughful and giving and I've decided to expand on that.      This year, we've decided to have 4-5 friends over for a playdate, lunch, and cake but we want to request no gifts. My daughter loves homemade cards, so how could I let my guests know this? Also, we've decided that rather than receive gifts (we really don't need anymore toys/clothes/etc..this kid has it all thanks to everyone's generosity already!) we'd like to give our guests gifts to say thanks for coming and celebrating.       Any suggestions on wording for the invitation? Any other great ideas for her party? Thanks!
20090220214527AAlgfJ1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	38 weeks pregnant and can go any day now!?	Well that is at least what my doctor said at my visit 2 days ago.  The problem is that I told my husband and he knows that I can go any day now but it doesn't seem to worry him.  He has gigs for his band every Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  His gigs end at 9:00 and it is now 11:40pm and he hasn't called to check on me.  He doesn't answer his phone when I call him.  The place that he plays at is like 5 mins from my home, so it is not like its a long commute.  I don't have a car anymore because it was stolen so I don't have a way to get to the hospital if I need too.  I want to scare him so that next time he at least calls and checks on me.  Anybody have any ideas on what I can do to scare him?  Thanks in advance!!!
20090220214623AA8oYxa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you drink during your pregnancy?	this is merely a question so don't start calling me a bad mother, irresponsible, etc. but IF you drank during your pregnancy, did you notice any difference in the activity of your baby (of course if it was late enough that movement could be felt)?
