Reading these links I came across that also cow dung and cow urine are used during the funeral rites and that funerals are taking place just a couple hours after death.   Now, is all this true? Beside that it is more than unhealthy, how can kids play in the water while maybe, let's say, grandma is floating by. Doesn't have a death to be confirmed by a MD? And why are cow dung and urine is used?   Can somebody please give me some insider knowledge on this to understand?      Thank you in advance.

I need flights that meet the following criteria:      3 people - all on the same flight - adults,   I need the flights to be about 2 weeks stay return (I have somewhere to stay). Roughtly from the 24 of February to the 10 of March +/-.   Departing from Heathrow London UK,  to Auckland international New Zealand. I don't mind departing from any London Airport.   They flights I found are roughly 27 hours long each way. (that includes stop offs etc).      I really don't want a flight that is 40 something hours long. (depends on price really I guess).      If anyone could give me some GOOD LINKS or find me a flight with plenty of seats available cheaper than the one I found then I guess I could even bung you 50 quid if they are a lot cheaper.      Thanks

I just called USAir and explained to them that my husband has a very close relative in the hospital and on her deathbed and that she might pass away this week.  I explained that online their rates right now are $600 or higher, and could she give me a discount?  She said she couldn't help us because the rates online right now are as low as they can go.  I was disappointed that she wasn't in the least bit sympathetic and couldn't offer me more options.  Does anyone know of another option?  I really want to get my husband a ticket to go see her one last time but we can't afford something that high.

20090221052411AAl71iO	Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe	American living in Spain...How do I avoid the Schengen rules?	So I've done lots of research and talked to a lot of people and I know that I am only allowed to stay in the Schengen for 90 days. Well, I'm teaching English in Spain and have been here since October, so my 90 days have come and gone. I'm not necessarily worried about traveling within the Schengen - I've heard the passport control is easier and that certain countries (Germany, for example) are more strict with their domestic passport control, so I'll avoid those.       WHAT I WANT TO KNOW: Does anyone have any tips for an American who has overstayed their 90 day travel visa, wants to leave the EU and come back without getting caught? Any "stories" I could use, i.e. 'I did go home for 3 months (which could be true from my last stamp) but since I already have an American passport they didn't stamp it when I got back.'      Tips I've heard: Italy is a lot more lenient with passport control (and I don't have a stamp from them so if I'm lucky they will only be searching for an Italian stamp). Get a connecting flight there and then come into Spain as a domestic arrival.
20090221052507AAOY3Qh	Travel;United States;Denver	What's the scene like in Denver, CO?	I lived in Florida my whole life. Recently, I have been saving up money to move to Denver.

I like to play music, actively, and wondered if there were people there who like to do the same. Also, I would like to hear from people who have been living in Denver for a while. I know I could tell anyone planning on moving to Saint Augustine, that they would be making a mistake. It's too small and you see the same people everyday. I was wondering if people my age from Denver would recommend moving there. Thanks for and help or advice. I really appreciate it!

I have been experiencing a combination of bizarre symptoms. I am female and It has been the first time I have been sexually active and the first few days have had some bad cramping in the abdomen  especially when taking food (not PMS cramps my period had just ended) and also sharp pain in the rectum during sex(no anal intercourse). then I took activated charcoal and that got rid of that completely. Then for about a week I became completely constipated with no bowel movements at all. I took a laxative for a week and a half but feel constipated and my stomach is gurgling all the time. I also started to notice that when I wake up from sleep or a nap, I get a headache and my head gets burning hot and my whole body as well but no sweat at all. Could you please tell me why I am experiencing these symptoms suddenly? I want to get answers from people who have experienced this or from a professional if possible.

Okay, I'm 16 and I'm going to Disney World Florida this summer with my family (parents and 14 year old brother). Can't wait!   I know it's early, but I can't help but get really excited! I've been there once before (when I was 8) and I just thought it was magical. I'm so excited already. I just can't wait at all!   It's gonna be amazing.   But what I was wondering was, does anyone have any advice or tips that could enhance the holiday?   Like, even things to do to pass the time in queues, or places to eat; and about which hotels are good, and shops.   And also, what kind of clothes you'd need to bring and what the weather's likely to be like in July/August (we're from Ireland. We don't really know the sun)      I'm the kind of person who's up for doing all the rides- when I was last there we went to Seaworld and I rode the Kraken front row :)   So yeah.. Any advice at all would be great.      Thank you so much!   Kate.x

20090203093257AA93ze9	Travel;United States;San Diego	San Diego Zoo/Wild Life Park advice and Sea World tickets?	We are taking 5 children ages 8-2 to San Diego Zoo and the Wild Life Park toward the end of July.  We are only spending ONE day at each park.  I would like to maximize our visit to the fullest in each day.  Therefore I need all the help I can get as to which things we should be sure to see and things that we can do without seeing.   I've never been to either before.  Not really interested in any shows.  Hands on things would be fun for the kids I think.  I'd like to gear the trip toward the children and not adult activities.        We would also like to spend ONE day at Sea World but the ticket prices are very expensive especially since we are purchasing the zoo.  If anyone could sell tickets much cheaper that would be a great help! 2 adult and 4 children.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

20090219180550AAgfLKj	Travel;United States;New York City	Is Stony Brook University even good (I'm sick of people ignoraning my questions. Answer or die)?	I got accepted there and it's the best college I applied to. However I'm a dual Irish and American student because my parents are from there and I lived there and I'm thinking about just moving back there. But if Stony Brook is really as good as some people think it is then I guess I'll go there.... The thing is I kind of applied to not-so-good schools like Adelphi and St. John's because I wasn't confident about my grades but it turns out I probably could have gotten into really good schools I was just being hard on myself.      So is Stony brook really good? Just don't say it's good to please me. Be completely f*cking honest. Is it comparable to the likes of NYU and Fordham and NYU? I see Stony brook is ranked 97 in the country... Would it be impressive in a job interview when I say I went to Stony Brook? Please be ruthless when answering this question. Thank you.       By the way the reason I don't know too much is because I live in freakin California... I like Stony Brook because it's close to NYC and it's so damn cheap and it seems like a good school. So is it excellent? Among the ebst in the country or what? Thanks.

According to them this may make me a horrible person that cannot perform the essential functions of my the job and will render me completely untrustworthy which is not the case.
