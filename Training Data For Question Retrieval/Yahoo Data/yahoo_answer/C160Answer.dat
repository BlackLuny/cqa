E6T9DPT9aa	Wealthy families have the money to pay for contraception and abortions. Also, kids from wealthy families have had the ability to go to school and get eduactaed about this stuff.    Poorer families are the opposite.    I'm just responding here to the "general" ways.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|YDs5mdHTaa	Er.. screw your statistics. Stop hating on them. Im more of an upper lower class.|`|KwkEvmpPaa	becasue wealthy middle class parents pay for abortion or give the baby for adoption|`|E7TzD7s2aa	cauz they cant afford condoms..duhhh|`|jojKjhUcaa	Because they don't have money for other activities, sex is cheap ya know free, Because of sorry parenting, parents that did not take their kids future into account when they decided not to finish school or pick a career with no long term applications, I was always told, medicine, engineering, mortician, law enforcement, education, can you see why.    Myself and my youngest brother are Engineers, the middle one a Policeman, oldest sister a RN.  two others are Teachers, 1 housewife married to an engineer, my dad was an Engineer my mother a Nurse, my oldest son starts law school next sept maybe, my 17 yr old starts college this summer, education, being taught responsibility, and being held accountable for their actions.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	They are bored and don't have the money to go to the movies. Seriously, sex is free and it fills time.|`|H2IqzG12aa	No future that they can see (in many cases, literally a short life expectancy), so live for the present, mainly.  Also, much of it is cultural, in most of the Third World, early pregnancy is the norm, and they never see that that's why the "old country" is still Third World.    Allie also has a point:  many middle and upper class teens also get pregnant, but they have easier access to abortions.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	b/c the wealthy family's pay for abortions, they wouldn't want to shame mommy and daddy|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	im middle class i got prego at 14 u do the math|`|iMULlxdgaa	I think more upper and middle class kids actually get abortions, so it just looks like they don't get pregnant. Lower/poorer kids don't have as much resources or $ for them to get the expensive abortions.  Or oddly enough people with less money seem to be more into God/ and or religion in general and so do not believe in abortions. But I think statiscally those statics are wrong!  Rich kids just get away with more crap!|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Jeez people it was just a question.  He never even said that he felt that way.  Statistically speaking, the more money and education a women has, the less likely she is to be a single parent.  I think that might have been true 30 years ago, but not today.  You can't believe everything you read.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Don't stereotype. One of my friends parents are lawyers, and she got pregnant and now has a 5 month old daughter. It's not just poor people, so stop hating on them. I'd like to see links to your statistics by the way.|`|iSMWMhHraa	Less access to health care and birth control. Lower self esteem resulting in risky behaviors is a possibility. Less education about health. Many factors would influence this statistic.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i dont think its true...i think society in this age likes to 'pinpoint' the blame on low income families but to be honest people forget at the end of the day its all down to parenting and education.|`|tg9D0tVGaa	because a lot of them dnt get taught sex ed and about protection and being respected, also they can aford condoms and dnt no how to get the pill  whereas middle class do they no where to get protection and can aford it and if they dont, they know to abort it so to not destroy their lives and change their future|`|eoRx8lITaa	Maybe because either they can't pay for abortions or their school didn't educate them enough.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	It's not necessarily that it's a stereotype.  It's just stats.  Middleclass and wealthy teens get pregnant as well (i.e. Bristol Palin, Jamie-Lynn Spears), but in terms of numbers, girls whose families are in the lowest strata are MORE likely to get pregnant.  It's not just that more of them become teenage moms or adopt.  Of teens who have abortions, the biggest group are also from low-income families.  I figure it's a combination of the following things.    1.  Parents are working a lot which can limit the amount of supervision they can provide.    2.  Very poor families often live in low-income neighbourhoods.  The schools are filled with other kids from similar circumstances who are also getting pregnant.  It's not considered that rare.  Also, schools get less funding and maybe doesn't have the access to the same resources as schools in the suburbs for middle class kids or private schools fro the very wealthy.  I.e. really excellent sex education.    3.  They figure they're not going anywhere in life - they're stuck in the low income lifestyle.  It's inescapable.  They can't afford college or don't feel smart enough to go (again, a product of poor education systems).  The most meaningful thing they think they can do is reproduce.    EDIT: Guys, abortions are counted under 'GET PREGNANT' as well - it's not that middle class people abort so therefore it isn't counted.  Abortion rates/numbers are also taken into account and it should be known that a significant amount of women in the lower income strata DO chose abortion (They feel they cannot miss the time for maternity leave, they cannot afford any more children, etc. etc. etc).  Abortion isn't a middle-class phenomenon.
o8xNTVWTaa	i have the exact same situation me and my bf  5 years together 4 years of having sex i was a virgin he had only slept with 1 girls... i big TIME SUCK at taking my pill we usually dont use a condom and he doesn't pull out either... how could it not have happened yet????  i always tell him iam not sure if his soldiers march... i guess the only thing to do if u want to try and get pregs is go and get ur self's checked out ...  best of luck iam sorry about ur mom|`|4DoXomHZaa	BC pills are 99.7% effective when taken correctly. So if you screwed them up, you were probably lucky. Pulling out doesn't work.     Get married. Buy your house. GEt your education. Then talk about trying for a baby. You have plenty of time. People change a lot in their early 20's....wait a couple years and make sure you really want to get married and have babies.|`|CsLyyRQeaa	Your birth control is working.  When you are ready to have kids you will stop taking it.  Then you will find out if your are able to have kids.  If you know that you could get cancer then you are a step ahead.  Most cancer is cure able.  Just keep an eye on the abnormal cells and when your ready have kids.|`|9EkFrApiaa	So are you on it now?  BC can lead to difficulty getting pregnant.  But if you guy shave never actively TRIED then it is unlikely.  My bf and I use the pull out method and have had a couple oops but the chances of me getting pregnant are slim because even women who are TRYING only have a 20% chance each month.    Until you guys have tried for a year, I wouldn't worry.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Your pill is probably working (hallelujah!). But if there's a positive family history of cancer, I'd be wary of the pill. Especially if you've had any type of abnormal pap smear. Does your doctor know about your family history, etc.? What type of cancer did she have and what do you mean by 'you have the same abnormal cells' as she does?
9LWuWHiMaa	It has always been this one thought that i know work for a fact.  As a parent we want our children to make the best decisions possible but only in utopia that happens also only in utopia will they listen to everything we say.  I am going to give you one piece of advice since I was not there during her formative years.   Two methods:  First of all invite her to lunch, then ease into the conversation so that by he time she realizes there is no turning back. Get into her head and find out what is the source of all this spending. Be her guide, Don't simply say you cant do this give options, for example, "honey i know you want the prada bag, but remember it is rent week so pay the bills and save towards it, afterall you cant live on the street."  also its time to get thicker skin, our children know how to play us, so we are either going to be losers or we are going to play along with them. If you know for a fact that she earns enough money to take care of herself then just say no. she needs to learn to be responsible and stand on her own feet. so when she mess up and come running to you ask her this question, "So, what are you gonna do?" if she cant take a hint, the simply say "NO" she will continueto take risks as long as mommy will bail her out. Leave her in the mess and let her bail herself out after all you weren't there whe the dum choice was made why should you have to clean it up.Maybe that is the shock she needs to wake up and realise that there are consequences for every poor choice we make. She is an adult and it is time to grow up.  mom just say no|`|3faz90KDaa	you have to start by letting her make her own mistakes and deal with the outcome.  let her pick herself up if you keep doing it she will never learn . trust me i've been there. its hard to do but it is for their own good .|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	she is an adult ..adults make their own mistakes.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	if she's an adult, she has to make her own decisions, choices and mistakes. tell her whatever you want, but it's her fault for not listening. she'll learn by doing. unless she's under the age of 18, you really can't do anything but offer advice...|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Set boundaries and rules. Only you can really stop her from doing stuff. If shes going out late...or doing drugs any of that crap you keep her in the house and tie her down if you have to lol.  TEll her the affect of what her bad decisions can do. Tell her shes smart and can do so much more then whatever bad stuff shes doing.  Give her interests to distract her from that bad behavior and dont let her hang out with the bad kids at school.  Most important set those rules and be strict.    edit: Oh im dumb i thought she was a teen. In that case yea its her own life.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	By young adult, is she of legal age to do as she pleases?  If that is the case, there isn't a damn thing you can do.     You've been very vague and generic with your question, and have not even stated how old your daughter is, so I cannot help you further.|`|AA11537580	you should just let her make her own mistakes unless they are life threatening|`|AA12174100	there is nothing you can do except to STOP giving her money and handouts. Perhaps when she has to make it on her own she'll make some good choices. But I completely understand what you are going thru. sometimes its harder to have children over 18 then when they were younger.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	Let her learn her own lessons.

Wish you the best of luck.|`|XCrtAUTpaa	If its drugs and she is an adult find out when she is doing it and get her caught then try to get her into rehab  if its not drugs then she'll have to learn on her own   if she's under age and still in ur care then cut her off|`|UrcheOECaa	I have 3 younger sisters... take it from me. You've done your job. as hard as it is to except it, she is going to do her own thing, especially if your trying to keep her from doing it.

r52rfBkeaa	Yogurt with whole milk.  Start with plain and try different flavors one at a time to rule out allergies, unless they've had the fruit separately and aren't allergic (like they've had a strawberry and are fine so it's ok to give strawberry yogurt).    Yo-baby is good b/c it comes in small cups and is made with organic whole milk.  I found it at local supermarkets, but not always.  I don't think Costco or Sams carry it and I don't think Walmart or Target do either.  Try the smaller stores like Albertsons, Safeway or Kroger, Tom Thumb...|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I always bought plain whole milk yogurt for him and mixed fresh fruit in it.

prqrQcd1aa	Go to the nearest ss office with 2 forms of id for yourself and 2 forms of id for your son..birth certificate, and letter from doctor saying you are the mother or something similar. They will give you the number if you have all other information. They will also give you a paper to fill out for a new ss card.|`|AA12071655	1. Is he the father named on the birth certificate?  2. Are the courts involved in any way (visitation, child support)?  3. Does he contribute to the child's support and well-being?  4. What is his excuse for not sharing this information?    As the birth mother (and apparently no signs of marriage) you are automatically the sole custodial parent unless family court has granted him some privileges. Even if he's listed as the birth father there was never a marriage, again, you are the sole custodial parent without family court saying otherwise.    Personally I'd tell him he's treading on serious ground and that he should either hand it over or consult with an attorney.|`|Knierqi9aa	Go to your local SS office w/proof you are th parent (your ID, kids birth certificate, current mailing address).  They should be able to mail you a dup. w/out you knowing the number.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Jane is right. There should be a SS office in your general area.  Make sure you call to verify their office hours before you go.
pXSKSS3daa	If she's not ready, she's not ready.    Of course you can stop if she shows signs of not being ready, that is what you SHOULD do. Take it slow and if she doesn't take to the solids you can always stop for a week or two and try again.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Absolutely.  When I started my son on solids we did it a couple of times and then nothing for a week, and then some more.  It was a good month before it became a daily thing.  If she likes it and is ready then great, if not...no harm done!|`|DNygQdmVaa	Id say if it turns out shes not ready yet then yeah its fine to stop and wait a few more weeks.|`|mGubEYTRaa	If your baby enjoys solids then absolutely offer that to her everyday, starting with rice cereal and then moving on to the tastier stuff.  However, if she doesn't enjoy it or seem ready, then it's perfectly acceptable to give her formula or breast milk exclusively for the first year.  You might try adding a small amount of rice cereal to the bottle to help her feel more full.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Google "baby-led weaning." You can let her self-feed from the start; no worries about whether she's ready or not -- if she's not, she won't feed herself, if she is, she will.    Useful: http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Of course you just stop if she's not ready.    You may also stop temporarily if she gets sick in future.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	Yes, it's fine to stop if she doesn't like it. There's a large variety of baby foods, so you have try another flavor. If this the case, wait a couple days before introducing something else because you want to see if she'll have a reaction. That's why you introduce a new food once a week.|`|IngripgMaa	We started solids (Sweet Potatoes, and carrots) and it didn't go over well.  He got constipated and was upset.  So, we went back to just formula and single grain rice cereal and it was fine.  We tried again a couple of months later....and he was ready then.  Good Luck!|`|qFmOuXMXaa	You can forsure stop.....I try my little one on cereal at 4 months and she loved it and did well but I felt her tummy wasn't ready (spit up) so I stoped so she is going to be 5 months on Sunday and I may try again and if she isn't ready I will wait again.     Good luck
VERrlErvaa	To answer your questions:    1) Still 'acting' like a girl. - I think he's obviously had a bit of a hard upbringing in the fact that he may have abandonment issues; this may have had an effect on his psyche.  There is definitely a situation that would require both you and his father to take him and consult a counselling service; but don't make him feel bad about the situation.    2) He can't be 'brainwashed' to act female.  There are several things that could be causing this behaviour.  He's only 12 and he is coming into puberty; he will be experiencing a lot of hormonal and chemical changes in his body.  Please allow for the fact that he may be just confused as the hormones start working their way through his body.    ** Now you also have to prepare yourself for the fact that he may turn out to be gay.  If this happens; you must support him - even if you don't accept it from a spiritual point of view, being exiled by his family would only make his world worse.    There is nothing sadder than a family rejecting one of their own; and being unable to cope - go into a state of over-zealous homophobia and start claiming possession, etc.    There is also a chance that he may have a condition called "gender dysphoria", which basically has been labelled as "transgendered" - born one gender, but identifying as as the opposite.  It has been recently discovered that this is not a choice, but a gene in the DNA strand.  It is not the fault of the child and the only thing you can do is give the individual a bit of respect and be extremely supportive.    I know people in this situation, which is why I can give you the information regarding the transgender information.    All you can do is to have him assessed and go from there. However, whatever you do - don't make him feel like whatever is happening to him is 'wrong'... You need to ensure he is happy, loved and safe.    As far as any religious issues you may have - it is up to God to decide the judgement issue - so, all you can do is give him a Bible and let him find God in his own way.  Don't force it down his neck, because he may turn away from you altogether.    Love and support is what he needs most.  He is obviously troubled and you need to get to the bottom of it.  Making him feel like a freak will not help.    Be kind and gentle and he's still just a kid and a one that is entering into a turbulent part of the growth process.    Good luck|`|4dQjVb59aa	He's not messed up..he's gay|`|q1cqgVVSaa	make sure you talk to the kid it is not right for someone to do that. soon when he grows up he will, well act weird. trto take him where he can be helped|`|jojKjhUcaa	Get him tested, find a therapist a family one, put him on a sports team one with contact, have you husband spend real time with him let him help him on week-ends after work fixing things changing oil what ever anything to help him identify with being male or he will be lost, don't let people say leave him alone he'll grow out of it act now and fast today.|`|J8DzGvX9aa	To say that "the kid is really messed up" is an overstatement...  I think you are messed up, I mean is a kid not allowed to act like that? Does every child have to act their age? I don't think so... it sounds like he might be gay, even if he is, how could you say there's something "terribly wrong" with him? you sound like a homophobe..  and since he's not your kid, you have no right to say how he should behave.  I mean even if he is being "brain washed to act female", so what?  homophobe..|`|c9cEZGfraa	sounds like you got a gay kid on your hands.|`|drI1vsJdaa	He needs therapy..fast!|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	Let him play with whatever he wants.    He'll figure it out when he's older.    Stop holding him up to the standards of social norms and let him be his own person.|`|gKllAGmnaa	yes he is his own person so he can mature at wutever rate (but that a sign of be a female dude on a gay relationship) in my opinion its wrong try giving him a power ranger or something.  get him some guy friends|`|xZvzLztZaa	If her were older I'd say he's just simply gay.    But at his age I'm inclined to say it's most likely just that he is very, very imature, and is used to the dolls and things because he was raised with them.    Regardless, I'd strongly recommend that he be seen by a psychiatrist.    Good luck,  Micah

phyWNEaFaa	If your period was just a week and a half ago, its unlikely you're pregnant, but then, you might be one of those women who bleed through pregnancy. Have you done a test yet, if you haven't I'd suggest you do one, if its negative,  its most likely you've got a short cycle and spotted with ovulation. its very rare for women to spot with ovulation, but atimes it does happen. hope this helps. Best of luck.|`|4DoXomHZaa	If you jsut got off your period a week and a half ago, you most likely haven't even ovulated yet, which is the only time you can get pregnant. It would be WAY to early to have any symptoms.    If you take precaustions to have safe sex,  you won't have to go thru scares like this. We now have more bc options available to us than ever, and living in the info age there is no excuse to not understand reproduction now.

vue9NOhYaa	When doctors recommend cereal for baby's with reflux, it's because the risk of leaving the reflux untreated (and having a baby who doesn't get enough to eat, or refuses to eat due to the pain) is greater than the risk of giving rice cereal to a young baby. (And yes, for babies with reflux, the cereal is fed by bottle.)    And yes, some mothers start solids early, and their babies appear to have no issues. Early solids are not guaranteed to cause problems, but the risk IS there.  And since the risk is easy to avoid ... why take it? Cereal provides nothing that a young baby (or any baby really) needs.    I started offering solids at about 5 1/2 months.  Until then, my daughter was exclusively breastfed. She did not start sleeping any longer.  She began sleeping the night at about 7 months.     When you do start solids (preferably at around 6 months) you can offer cereal if you wish.  There's nothing 'wrong' with it.  It's cheap and convenient, and most babies seem to like it.  But baby doesn't *need* rice cereal, so many moms do opt to offer other foods instead. Or they try rice cereal and baby doesn't like it, so they try something else.     Rice cereal became the standard first food back at a time when most babies were fed home-made formula. Such formulas lacked many important nutrients, so babies DID need solids early to keep from becoming malnourished.  Rice cereal was invented as a cheap and easy way of providing necessary iron to babies too young to really eat solids -- it could be mixed to a sloppy soup and force-fed to young infants, or fed by bottle.  But today, most babies are either breastfed or given commericial formula. And both of these foods provide all the nutrients baby needs until at least 6-8 months -- so there's no need to force iron-fortified starch.|`|zwctZ812aa	Most people with babies with bad reflux give it in a bottle even though it can be potentially dangerous.  That is why it is a last resort, because babies have a hard time eating off of a spoon at that young age.  We plan to skip rice cereal all together and give baby oatmeal at 5 or 6 months.  Rice cereal is actually difficult for babies to digest and can casue constipation.  Many people suggest going with oatmeal instead.  It may help a baby sleep at night, but that's only because their tummies are not able to digest it and it sits in there longer, giving them the illusion that they are full.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Sorry i cant help you with this one.. You need to listen to the other ladies who answered..Its been too long for me since i had a baby.. good luck on this one..

Sleep patterns are developmental phenomenon, they don't have much to do with hunger patterns. Kids wake up hungry, but they don't wake up because they are hungry.    Cereals started as an important part of a child's diet back when the infant formula companies couldn't get an absorbable form of iron into the formula.  They then fortified rice cereal with iron and introduced the rice cereal early into the diet as a way to make sure the kids got the iron.  Chances are pretty good that the eventual increase in sleeping at night that happens around six to eight weeks of age coincided with the introduction of the cereal, but not because of it.    Now, all the infant formulas are fortified with iron and of course, breastmilk has an abundant and easily absorbable supply of iron in it, so we really don't need an extra source.  If you take away the iron in the cereals, it's just starch.     And if you buy this idea that rice cereal "sits" in the stomach, then we have to talk about that too.  Nothing "sits" in the stomach (even when kids eat pennies and stuff, that stuff passes).  It's a metabolically active organ always working to digest its contents.    And at least one study has recently showed that early introduction of rice cereal (prior to 4 months of age) is a risk factor for the development of diabetes.    Different types of food take longer to digest.  Starch, which is what rice cereal is, is really easily digested.  Starches are used as quick sources of energy.  If we stayed asleep for however long our bellies are full (which I don't believe either or we would never sleep for 6-8 hours a night) then starch would be a poor choice.  We would need to load our kids up with a Big Mac or something to get them to sleep longer since fat is the slowest food type to be digested.    That's a long explanation to say that I don't really think the cereals are necessary-- they aren't a good source of nutrition and they don't make kids sleep and may, with the new info on the link to diabetes, be actually be harmful.   The AAP says 6 months without solids...we are learning that the rush to solids foods is NOT a good idea."    http://www.drjen4kids.com/myths/mythrice...|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter had reflux and had it in her bootle so she could keep down her milk after losing 3lbs due to sever projectile vomiting and degydration (was in hospital) in thi scase its absolutely ok if it helps with a health problem    giving babies any food to early that they relly need when m,ilk is doing them just fine can cause digestive problems later in life, allergies etc etc the list goes on. however if you baby is hungry then of course feed it i just dont see the big deal parents make if there 4 month old want milk every two hours rather than three. its only an hour and an extra bottle to clean.    sleeping better is a myth...sleeping through the night is purely developmental not a fuller tummy.    rice cereal can go in a bottle you get nipples to allow it to come through:))))|`|1ezYfkX7aa	My first bad had really bad reflux and would get a teaspoon or rice cereal in his bottles to help hold down the formula instead of throwing it up. We didnt find out he had reflux until he was about 2wks old and it helped ALOT. I wouldnt give it to a baby without reflux until at least 3 1/2months at the earliest because some say it helps the baby sleep longer...but thats not always the case. It could give the baby a very bad belly ache and constipate them. They are just to small to digest all of that at such an early age. My kids were VERY big babies though and by 3 1/2months formula was just not doing it so i started to give them very runny cereal out of the bowl once a day and then after a week of them doing very good with it increased it to 2x a day. By 4-41/2 months they were on step 1 babyfoods. Goodluck =)|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	I started my son on a little rice cereal mixed in his bottle when he was a few days old.  My son was large when he was born (9lbs; 10 ozs.)  Breastmillk and formula were not filling him up at all.  He was screaming hungry 30 minutes after finishing a bottle.  Once we put the rice cereal in his bottle, he was much more satisfied.  He started sleeping better and was not as hungry all the time.|`|Knierqi9aa	I have 2 kids and had (due to moving) 3 pediatricains tell me not to do it.  They all said under normal circumstances, there is no reason to do it, fromula/brest milk has everything they need, infants stomachs are not ready for cereal, and the list went on.  I would listen to your ped.  they can make the best choice for each child and what is safe and not safe.  My 1st child spit-up like crazy,was a terrible sleeper, but time went on and she grew out of it.  I never considered giving "solids".  Some people belive in the "will help them sleep all night" ,but my 2nd always slept all night and only had breast milk until the average time to introduce foods.|`|ehpFAfdgaa	first off all babies are different...i started feeding my son cereal in his bottle about 1-2 months i'd say...i did ruin some of the nipples by cutting them to deep but if you can cut one and do it just right your baby should be fine...when i gave it to my son he rarely spit up anymore and my son slept about an extra 2 hours at night...the doctors and pediatritions tell you these things because they have to follow the "book" i can almost guarantee half of those people dont even listen thereselves...so its really up to you..it helped my son...and nothing happened to him...he is now 16 months old healthy and as happy as can be!!! hope this helps!!|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	i started feeding my baby cereal at about 2 months. she's now almost 4 months and eats cereal, fruit and some veggies. i only give her these foods once a day, but she likes them and it has not been detrimental to her. she's growing, gaining weight and developing like a normal child, so i see no harm in it. i think the sleeping all night thing is a myth, though. every baby is different, and not all of them sleep through the night, regardless of what you feed them. the only reason pediatricians say wait until 6 months is because they believe you may predispose or expose your child to potential allergies if you start before their immune system is stronger. but i know people, like you do, who have started their children on solid foods before 6 months and they have no allergies. so, again, every child is different... do as you will!|`|TxDrVt3haa	Babies don't need anything but breast milk for the first 6 months.     My baby was very big and so the doctor thought we could start her at 3 or 4 months (she even had 4teeth!) But her indications of maturity were false, she had lots of pain, was not digesting properly , it took  us a while to figure out that she was just not ready.  she reached 6 months and we kept trying different things, pure misery. I took her off of solids and tried again at 7 months. Success! We probably could have avoided the whole mess if I just didn't bother.    New research indicates babies do not need rice cereal for any reason at all before 6 months. And even then, it is not a rule, but they just need something that is high in iron, and since it doesn't cause allergies, rice usually fits the bill.  You could try mashing a banana, or even pureed meat, lots of things will be okay.    Sleep is neurological, not related to the digestive system at all.  But giving them something hard to digest will make them uncomfortable and that will keep them awake!|`|dOeE9GCcaa	My daughter is 4 months and I started this a few weeks ago. Its hard but you have to spoon feed him/her. I ruined so many nipples trying to get her to drink out the bottle and it made to choke. She is just now getting the hang of it. If she spits it out then you just wipe it off of her face and put it back in her mouth. It didnt help mine sleep through the night... I was gonna wait until 6 months but started early figuring it would help. All babies are different though and you are the mother so it is your decision. Good luck|`|AA12300309	Well I guess you could say my baby started it at 2 months. He had severe reflux and was put on Enfamil AR formula. The AR stands for added rice. We didn't start spoon feeding him until he was 4 months, as recommended by the pediatrician. It didn't help him sleep all night, that's for sure!|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	We're starting it tonight with our 7 week old because he has bad reflux. Dr. said he probably would sleep a little longer but he sleeps through the night anyway. He told us to put it in a bottle with a level 2 nipple. The box said one tablespoon per ounce but dr. told us one tablespoon for every 2 ounces.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	The doctors say to wait until 6 months for any solid food because they have gotten rid of the tongue reflex of pushing stuff out of their mouth, most can sit up by then, and their insides are a little more developed.      I gave it to my daughter at about 4 months, in a bottle.  The doctor said not to put it in a bottle because it can cause them to become overweight.  Other people say they can choke from it.  I watch her very closely though and take it out of her mouth every few seconds to prevent choking.   It has not helped her sleep better at night.  She is 7 months old now and still gets up once in the middle of the night, every night.    I'm not sure what they do about giving it to babies with reflux.  You could try to spoon feed, but depending on when your baby will allow a spoon in his/her mouth depends on if you can spoon feed the cereal or not.    Starting out, you give the baby 1 tablespoon of cereal to 4 oz of formula/water and work your way up from there.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I started my son on it at 4 months recommended by my doctor.  He hated it...and after a week I decided to throw it out and started him on sweet potatoes.  Since then he's been on solids and he loves meal times.  As of right now he has no allergies present.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Just because you know of people that have given their babies cereal early doesn't mean YOU should.    All websites will tell you that four months is the absolute earliest to start solids and 6 months is more ideal. Before this time your baby's system just isn't ready to digest anything more than breast milk or formula properly.    Doctors usually look at other ways to help cure reflux before resorting to rice cereal. If a baby is younger it is recommended to give cereal in their bottles for reflux but only under doctor's supervision(meaning they tell you how much, how often, what types of bottles to use, etc.).|`|AA11327039	I didn't really give my first cereal.  I waited until she was 5 months and 2 weeks and started giving her mashed potatoes.  She loved them.  Then I gave her carrots, peas, green beans (all the pureed version)....I went through all the veggies I could think of.  She was about 9 months old and I started giving her some cereal.  She didn't really like it so I just gave her oatmeal and cream of wheat and she did fine with that.  Then around that time I started giving her the fruits (pureed).    With my son, he had reflux very badly.  I gave him the Similac AR or Enfamil AR....whichever one had the added rice.  He didn't do well on that so I took him off quickly and gave him the regular formula.    Both of mine started sleeping through the night around 6-8 weeks old.    Neither would nap during the day for very long at all....maybe 20 minutes the ENTIRE DAY, broken down into 2 or 3 mini naps.
faPKwClPaa	He's had blankets on him since he started sleeping in his crib, so about 3 months old (go ahead and give me the thumbs-down, SIDS scaremongers).    As long as they can move their heads, they can move away from the blanket if they don't want/need it near them.  Depending on the temperature, we'll either find our son asleep under the covers, or he's kicked them off.|`|AA11600455	my daughter is two months old and she has been sleeping with blankets since she was born. it is perfectly fine. she is fine. go ahead and let your child sleep with it.|`|dbd1e999d2db32deb12894e60c629053aa	My son has always had blankets and stuff in his crib in is almost 5 months now! He has been fine. I do always make sure that the covers are not over his face when i fall asleep though. But he does fine and he actually sleeps with 2 covers on him and has for a while now. Its cold here though. He also has his glowworm, pillow, and a teddy bear. I dont believe any of those things will ever come to live and jump on his face and suffacate him though. Just make sure when you go to bed his face is not covered by the blankie. But Im sure he is well old enough now to be able to move the blanket away from him if he needs to! Good luck.|`|bc9inzicaa	My son has had a blanket since birth.  I check in on him every few hours to make sure he is okay and thus far, he's done great.  He is five weeks old now and has started getting into the habit of moving his blanket (i'm pretty sure they are involuntary actions) over his head or away from him; however, i'm not that concerned since he can move his head.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	I'm german and i've never even heard of such a thing as letting a baby sleep without a blanket unless it hot outside. Even in the hospital they have blankets in the newborns bed! And not once in decades has there been a case of a baby dying because of a blanket. What do you do when its cold? It's way more comfy with a blanket,9 try sleeping without a blanket in the winter) of course your little one is trying to sleep with his security blanket. I do believe he doesnt wanna sleep because its not comfortable.   I don't mean to sound rude( so please excuse me if i might, i'm not trying to) but americans do tend to overreact on stuff liek this. Its because americans love to put the blame on soneone so lets say your baby dies of.S.I.D.S. and u had a blanket in the crib well, that mustve been the reason since something has to be the reason, right...lol   Don't worry so much, let him be comfy.
8wnvhBQTaa	Run the bath or shower and let the bathroom fill with steam and strip her to her nappy and take her in there for about 10 mins this will loosen any mucus which she will cough but will not beable to cough it right up and will swallow it she might be sick after a milk feed and bring some of the mucus back up with some milk.  Try a vapour plug in if you have one, also if she is having trouble sleeping because of her breathing raise her cot so she is sleeping at an angle, make sure she is well hydrated and if you are worried before tommorrow phone NHS 24 if you like in UK that is.  Hope she is feeling better soon.|`|r5R2nstRaa	saline drops! great for mucus, or if you're a breast feeding momma, you can also use your breast milk as drops. saves money! but if not saline drops are a must. good luck! if it doesn't seem to work, just take the baby to the doctor. only thing left to do!|`|pDRAciBnaa	just use steam from running a bath,or shower!!|`|z7a9F4HNaa	use saline nasal drops they work like magic.|`|yAjAHADiaa	Use a humidifier or put some water in a pot on the stove and simmer it.  It helps loosen the mucus and should help her cough it up.  A dry cough is worse than a productive cough.  She'll be able to breath easier.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Saline drops and also if you don't have a Humidifier go in the bathroom and turn the shower on HOT and sit on the toilet and let her breath the warm mist...worked for me
GPW6HUZFaa	I doubt it since it's just temporary guardianship.  You would need to ask someone who deals with adoptions or whoever granted the guardianship to be sure though.|`|Fh6ozB5faa	I am no attorney but I think the word "temporary" would limit the ability to alter a childs life.  Good Luck...|`|2wyDALHgaa	Temporary guardianship is just that, temporary and as such it comes with certain built in restrictions, limitations and safeguards.  If you have any concerns contact a lawyer.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	No, I'm pretty sure they can't do that in any state.  Have the parents rights been terminated? Probably they still have them or there is someone who has 'more' rights than the person with temporary guardianship. Even when there isn't I do not think that having temporary guardianship is ever sufficient for a person to place the child for adoption.  You could try calling a local family/adoption attorney though just to make sure.|`|biqMTkWbaa	No, You have to get the biological parents to sign consent forms.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	No.    Temporary guardianship does not give the guardian the right to enter into a permanent contract concerning the subject of care.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	I know a lot about adoption law. So email me. You can get a hold of me by my profile. I would need your email address to write back since you don't allow contact on your profile. :0)|`|AA12174100	first, there is alot more to adoption than just signing papers. First, the bio parents must agree and go to court and have their parental rights terminated. But in the meantime the temp. guardian must apply to the state, and get approved to adopt. Usually a home study and lots of interviews and background checks. The guardian would have to follow whatever laws their state has on adoption and the same as any other person adopting.
dPyfP0ijaa	The reason there are time limits on the pool (ie. no swimming allowed after 9-10pm or so) is because of the noise. Construction is allowed to start work at 7am and go until regular business hours are over.     Screaming, shouting, playing etc are EXPECTED at a pool!!. This should not be tolerated, If I were you, I'd go further into it, possibly as far as going to court.     This is a COMMUNITY pool and I'm sure you pay a part to keep it up, right? It's YOUR right to use the pool or to allow your guests (up to 4) to use the pool during normal hours.    Are there "NO SCREETCHING" rules posted??    Who owns the complex? Is it privately owned or owned by a larger corporation?      This is really silly of them to kick a child out of a pool for having fun. Ridiculous. You should really throw a fit about this.    As far as the doctors complaining, they live in an apartment complex, if they want quiet, they should move to the country.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	If you don't want to hear noise from the pool don't rent an apartment near the pool. It is rediculous to expect a 3 year old to talk quietly when he is playing and swimming. It is realy sad that people get so annoyed by little kids and their "noise".  Kids make noise and lots of it. If it is a public pool then they shouldn't be able to discriminate like that.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	I think that it's perfectly normal for a child of that age to squeal with delight in a swimming pool.     I believe that the manager of the complex is being unreasonable - and infringing on your right to enjoy the community amenities.     It is of no consequence to you if the tenants work night shifts and have to sleep during the day. If you are not habitually making a ruckus then it's their responsibility to drown out the normal noise made during daylight hours.     If they complain to her, so be it. It's not up to you to restrict an otherwise happy child from enjoying a swim at their grandparents house.|`|hOwkTiHAaa	i would be there with them so you can see yourself. see if the complaints occur again

In which case, you may have encopresis, a condition in which the fecal matter becomes impacted and only small amounts of liquid feces is squirting around a large, hard mass of feces.    Go to your doctor to ensure that you don't have an obstruction and ask for a regimen that you can follow to help regulate normal bowel function and daily cleansing of your bowels.|`|AA11586880	Well, then, No one can say you are full of it.

He got frustrated at one point and bit down and I pretty much gave up, lol... the pump doesn't bite, lol.  But, I went on Kellymom and went to the forums.  There is a forum on relatching.  It was very helpful!!!  I just chickened out, lol.  My son is 7 months old... please keep in touch and let me know if you have any success with it.  Thanks!!!  And I hope you find some good info on Kellymom.  Good Luck!!!!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Ahhh, I remember the weird part from family and friends.  Just do what's best for your baby and don't worry about it.  I'm sure many of them admire you as well.  It's worth a try but you really do have to be realistic.  After 4 months of age, it's *almost* impossible.  Good luck!!!!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, as far as fam and friends go, their opinion isn't important...  if  your baby has been drinking from a bottle for a while, u make have difficulty with getting him to latch, bc it is soo much easier to get milk out of the bottle; maybe someone else  will have a better idea as to get him to do it......if u have been using the pump exclusively and not putting him to the breast, i don't know if he will go back...it's great that u want to, but it may be unrealistic if he's used to a bottle; if u can't get him to latch, as much as u dislike it, bm is better for him, but formula isn't poison...just depends on how committed you are to both him latching and receiving bm...sorry i couldn't help more....|`|r5R2nstRaa	i don't for one, recommend trying to put you baby on now. its kinda too late. either your baby is never going to want to do that, or you'll get you baby to feed, and he won't want to wean off. in a few months your baby with be 1 year! if you don't want to pump any more, try formula, if you don't want to, then you're just going to have to keep pumping.|`|AA11540967	I was wondering the same thing, but my son is 3 months.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Honestly I haven't  heard of anyone succeeding that late BUT that doesn't mean you shouldn't try!  I have heard of previously breastfeeding but weaned babies going back to nursing after mom has another baby.    Look if you try and it doesn't work out all that you have lost is time, and its time you spend snuggling with your baby so that's no big loss.  Just don't stress you or the baby out over it, because that is not worth it!    You should also try e-mailing La Leche League, maybe they know someone.  And e-mail Diane Wiessinger.... uh but I don't see her e-mail listed on her new site... and your e-mail is blocked?  Hmmm e-mail me and I can give it to you, I don't want to just post it here, here site is normalfed.com      Help -- My Baby Won't Nurse!   http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...  Introduction    The following techniques have proven helpful for a wide range of problems with baby refusing the breast. Some of the babies who might benefit include:        * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)      * a baby with nipple confusion      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)      * a baby on a nursing strike    Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."    If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	Explain its the best an easiest way to wean your son AND your breast.. You can feed your son for so long then top him off with other liquids of food and then he does not eat as much and your breast slowly decrease which is less painfull then just stopping (experience thank god it was only a month son rejected my milk and breast) The pump is not as good as your son will be and so you son is a better instrument to decrease your milk with..    I would think your son would pick up latching.. if not he will learn.. If you have the right nipples. If your nipples are flat or invereted check out things to help that.. That was a prob I had..|`|OtbbKdITaa	While I personally think it's odd you want your son to latch on now, it is none of my business how you raise your child. Tell that to your friends & family. You're the one who has to deal with his sharp new teeth on your nipples, not your friends and family.    BTW - I have never heard of this working at such an advanced age.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Wow, I'm impressed, and I wish you the best of luck.  I don't know if you can get much better advice than from Dr. Newman.    I don't know anyone personally who has gotten their baby to latch at that age.  Have you checked out any adoption boards?  I've heard of moms breastfeeding adoptive babies, some of whom were adopted at older ages, but I don't know how old they were.  Someone who has done that may have good advice for you even though your siutation isn't exactly the same.    I assume you're already using lots of skin-to-skin contact.  Have you tried trickling some expressed breastmilk down your nipple when you're trying to get baby to latch on?  It might help him realize that breasts are for getting breastmilk and give him the incentive to latch on. (I used a similar trick with my first daughter when she was first born and wouldn't latch.)    I know it must be hard, but try to ignore your unsupportive family and friends.  Many people don't understand the importance of breastfeeding and a good nursing relationship.  I can't imagine how hard it must be to exclusively pump -- kudos to you, and I really do wish you the best of luck getting baby to nurse at the breast.    I breastfed my first daughter for 14 months (she weaned when I was 6 months pregnant with baby  2).  I breastfed my second daughter for 2 1/2 years (weaned when I was 6 months pregnant with baby  3).  My son is now 17 months old and still nursing quite a bit.      It's totally worth it, and I really do wish you the best.  If you are successful, share your story far and wide so that others can benefit from your experience as well.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I think that it is great that you want to breastfeed your child.  The only thing that I can suggest is to keep offering the breast to him.  Trying at night when he is drowsy or asleep is probably your best bet.  Maybe try to express some out so that he can taste the breastmilk and know that is where it comes from.  I have heard of someone doing this at 6 months so doing it at 8 months is not that far fetched.      Explain to your family that breastfeeding is the best for your baby and you feel like you are doing what is best for your baby.  Who cares what they think, it is not any of their business.    Also, let us know if it works for you.....and Good Luck!|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	Wow! That is amazing that you have pumped for 8 months! What a great mommy you are!     I don't really have any tips :-( But I do want to say good luck!    PS - tell friends and fam to back off, they can raise their babies however they want, let u raise yours.|`|PAdif484aa	Have you tried nipple shields? They are made of synthetic material and feel much like a nipple on a bottle. My baby had trouble latching on in the beginning and we used them. When he was about 6 weeks old, he decided he didn't want to use them anymore and just stopped. He latched on to me right away and we haven't needed them since. When we used them, I would put it on, bring him in to latch on and he would. Then, after he had a decent amount of milk, I would take it off and offer him the breast without the shield. Sometimes he'd take it, sometimes not. Now he just uses the breast. Good luck! I hope this suggestion helped.|`|9tNr1RMfaa	I certainly think it is possible, but it might be really hard. I know this might be a dumb question, but have you tried a nipple shield? That would make your nipple seem more like the bottle, which he would be used to. He just might not know why you are giving him your breast.     The reason I am saying that it will be difficult is because there are lots of developmental changes that take place between six and eight months, and these changes seem to effect the child's "nursing behavior." When my son learned to sit up he would sit up during nursing sessions and want to switch boobs, etc. When he learned to crawl he started climbing all over me, and when he got teeth he started biting me.     Now he knows not to bite, and we have learned new positions, but it has been a relationship that has grown and developed over time. I would just imagine that you would not only have to teach him to latch, but also how to latch without biting. It would not be the same as teaching a baby to latch. You will essentially be teaching a (near) toddler.     My son is twelve months, and I now lay on my back now instead of my side, because he likes to lay in my armpit or on top of me while nursing to sleep.     But still, I think it is definitely possible, and I would LOVE to hear if you have any success.     Good luck!!|`|FidZNMmUaa	Have you tried a supplimental nursing system.  If he gets some breastmilk at the same time with a tube attached to your nipple, he may be more inclined to suck. Good for you for trying.  I hope it works and I think it certainly can.
dd6rgtL7aa	Well, if the man wants to raise the child and the woman agrees to carry the baby and let him legally adopt the child....then no. Absolutely not she should not be obligated to this child in any way. It is the woman's choice, therefor it can be treated as an adoption. She can be a baby machine for the man and his child. Under no circumstances can a man tell a woman what to do with her body. So, she can make the stipulations as she wishes.    Of course this issue can never be as simple as black and white, but based on the simplistic nature of your hypothetical scenario, I answered as simply as possible.|`|J4W68owgaa	Well, without getting into an abortion debate and womens rights to her own body, let me say this:    If one parent is not living with the child, they should pay child support. If the father has custody of the child and the mother does not, then yes, the mother should pay child support.    P.S. Why did you put this in this section? Wouldn't it have been better off in Society?|`|DHyUnhS1aa	No one could force me to stay pregnant if I didn't want to.  Something as simple as fasting for a while could easily cause a miscarriage and take care of the situation.  That being said if I became pregnant and didn't want it but the father did I would consider giving birth and giving it to him.  But if he told me in addition to this he was going to file for me to have to pay child support then I would abort it.  Ungrateful asshole.    The roles cannot be completely reversed because the man is never the one who has to carry the little bastard around for nine months then shove it out his poop-hole.  But if the men were the one's who had to sacrifice their bodies then they would and should get to choose if the pregnancy would continue or end.|`|lzivF4Idaa	if she has the child then yes she should pay child support. if you make it you can pay for it! thats my take on it lol|`|AA10186411	Unfortunately, present laws prevent a man from forcing the mother to have the child.  I think if the father is more than willing to raise the child on his own, then the mother should have to have the child.  Its a double standard.  We blame the man for getting a woman pregnant and leaving, but never the woman for getting pregnant and aborting.  If though, the woman does end up having the child and the father raises it, yes he is entitled to child support because the child is just as much hers as it is his.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I agree with this. The woman should most definitely have to pay support if she gives it to the dad,as the dad has to pay support if the mom has the baby,and he's not living with her. It's not right to let women off scott -free from it,no. I do agree with if the dad wants the baby,he should be able to voice that and take custody of it when it's born. I don't like how women handle this situation usually honestly.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I think that if she has the baby then yeah- she should pay child support, but I don't think that the laws should be changed regarding abortion.  It is the woman's choice, and the man shouldn't have a say in it.  I think it should be left up to the woman to discuss getting an abortion or not with the guy, but ultimately it's her decision.  The guy should not be able to "force" her to have the baby.  The man also shouldn't be able to "force" the woman to pay child support- the courts should.  Just like a woman doesn't "force" a man to pay- the courts do.  The woman just pursues it.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Yes she should.She is also the parent.|`|7Ac0A1LTaa	no , well thats my opinion|`|7ES4xMloaa	yes!!! Absolutely its that way for guys and equal rights should always be equal|`|4gXXUrqDaa	The mother should have the baby if the father wants it and she should be forced to pay child support.  If you can go out and have unprotected sex then you can't have an abortion like that.  That's cheating the consequences not to mention cheating life.  Just like if the father were to want the baby aborted but the mother said no, the father has to pay child support.  So why not have the reverse be true?|`|hbmZqhscaa	yes the father can have word in whether or not his child is put up for adoption. if he wants to raise it then he can. and yes he can get child support from the biological mother. it doesnt matter if she wanted the child or not. reverse the roles.....if the man says well i didnt want the child and i wanted her to get an abortion so i dont have to pay.....then it wouldnt be any different. whoever doesnt have custody usually has to pay child support.|`|G4qP2gATaa	If she carries the baby to full term then decides she wants nothing to do with him/her then she should be forced to pay child support.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	If he convinces her to have the child and he raises it, then yes - she should pay child support.  Let's look at it this way.  Let's say a married couple have two kids and get divorced.  Mom doesn't want them and makes more money than dad, so Dad takes on the full parenting responsibilities.  The mother is expected to pay child support.  It isn't too much different than your scenario.

5BOZ2ryLaa	You have every right to be angry.  I would tell him in no uncertain terms that a gun is never to be brought into your home again, nor are your children ever to be exposed to guns.  I don't care how old he is.     I got my first gun before I was 10, was taught to respect guns, and made an informed choice not to have one in my home.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I would have said something right when he pulled it out.  But I think it's still fine to say something after the fact.  Tell him he can invite the adults over (without kids) for the gun demonstration, but that you don't want it around your kids.  I would hope that even gun fans (of whom I'm not one) would be understanding about that.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I would bring it up with him. maybe not start a screaming match but nicely mention it. Sort of like reminding him of you rules. If it happens again, then that may warrent some screaming|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I would confront him. I feel the same exact way you do. I do not like guns at all. I would tell him in a way that is non-confrontational but let him know to respect your wishes. If you were a smoker and he isn't I'm sure he'd let you know in a heartbeat that smoking is not permitted. Speak up and let your stance known immediately.|`|j2mRop0laa	It's your house. Don't let it go.     I would absolutely love to take some shooting lessons and get a gun. A really rockin hand gun, actually. But- I don't want to have one around my kids, so maybe I'll do it when they move out.    I grew up with guns. My dad kept them in a locked cabinet. He used them for hunting and scared the daylights out my sister and I from going anywhere near the things.    I'm with you, on this, though. It's too much risk with kids around. Maybe it really isn't a lot of risk, but if you don't FEEL safe and cozy, then no. No guns when he visits. Accidents happen.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I would have kicked him out ..BIG SCENE! My ex used to have guns and one day he was at work and I dismantled all of them and burried them in the yard ...too bad bucko!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	of course it will be reported.  if its not a question to stir debate it should be reported.  :-)    first - how is your relationship with your brother?  if its good - talk to him, not confront, but talk.  explain your position and feelings and reiterate again - no guns in your house.  he should respect that.  if its not so good - well then its pick your battles - is this a battle you want to make w/him or not.  is it a one off thing or is usually doing things like this.  i think answering those questions should tell you what to do.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Your house, your rules. Tell him he can't bring his guns in your house.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I would have kicked him out right then and there...ok, maybe that is pushing it, but i definately would have made him remove the gun from my house.  I don't like guns and do not want them anywhere near me or my child either.  I'm ok with others having guns if they so choose.  I'd definately confront your brother and remind him of your house rule.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Whoa I am with you 100%. It is totally inappropriate to bring a gun into someone elses home, even if it's unloaded. I don't want that thing anywhere near my family - and he knows you aren't into guns so he really shouldn't have done that. I think you should talk to him about it and tell him you don't want him bringing a gun into your home ever again. You don't want your kids getting the impression that guns are somehow cool or toys - which seems to be the way your brother views them.|`|sxecXFgraa	Your brother should have respected you enough to not bring the gun into your house.  I would talk to him about it and let him know that you don't want it to happen again.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i agree with you, he was in your home after all.  i have a cousin like that, not necessarily about guns but other stuff, he always has to have bigger & better things, always bragging about them.  we can all see through it because he isn't as wealthy as he thinks he is.  it is super annoying. >(  anyways, yes your brother should respect your wishes especially in your own house.  you need to sit down & talk to him about it & let him know if he keeps doing it he may not be welcome anymore.  good luck|`|um2KrDAsaa	If it matters this much to you, I would just tell him how the gun made you feel.  He might have not thought too much about it when he did it, but if you tell him about it, maybe he will be more considerate in the future.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I would definitely have a chat with him.    That's fine that he carries a gun around for his protection...but that is why it is called a *concealed* handgun.  It's not show and tell, and he should know that from the class he had to take in getting that concealed handgun permit.|`|92318d2de373ecc807b1a2e15fbad4b6aa	Definitely confront him...and you should have confronted him then! He needs to know that it's not okay or cool to bring weopons(sp) around your children...period! You are so NOT overreating. Nip it in the butt now so he won't do it again!    I would totally be pissed!|`|BbfNMXtiaa	I would be PISSED. No one should ever pull out a real gun in front of kids unless it's going to be a conversation about safety and NOT touching it! And if you don't like guns in your home, that is so disrespectful. I would confront him, tell him exactly how you feel and say that he is not welcome in your house again if he ever brings a gun with him - rules are rules. And you are talking about the safety of your family, too!|`|aEAEinjPaa	Confront him. it wasn't necessary for him to show off. if you dont want him doing that in YOUR home, then you should say something to him.|`|6QeCC91oaa	I think you have every right to go to him and tell him how you feel. It was very disrespectful, in my opinion, that he did that in your home. I too, am against guns and have the same thoughts as you do about them. I don't even allow water guns. I think you need to insist that your brother respect you and your family's rights to be gun free. I am sorry that he lives in a bad area, but not all people living in a bad area or not choose to carry a gun. I think it matters not where you live, its a choice you make. This situation though, to me, is about respect. Go get yours. Good luck.|`|nopHdd9Kaa	I would confront him.  He knows the rules of your house.  Why bring it there if he wasn't going to listen.    My mother felt the same way about guns when my father and her first got married, so every time my uncle (a cop) would visit after he got off work, he would leave his gun in the locked car out of respect of his brother and his wife and my uncle was the older sibling.      I hate to say it but if your brother respected you, he wouldn't have done it in the first place.

eV5E9MhUaa	The day you miss your period, unless you get an early detection one, then it's like... 4 days early.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Although some tests advertise early detection, the best time to take a home pregnancy test is after you have missed your period.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	If you aren't due for 25 days then that means you should be on your period right now, or just finished it. You know you count from the first day of your period right? So, that means you started your period 3 days ago. If that's the case then the only way you could be pregnant is if you had sex in the last 3 days and even then it is highly unlikely you would feel anything different in your body yet.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	The early tests can test 5 days before your missed period.|`|8jsoK3zdaa	4 days before your expected period|`|IA5zVfk0aa	see i had to wait 2 weeks after my period was late because my low hcg hormone was low, if you keep getting negatives and your period is still late go to a clinic to get a ultrasound and blood test done :)|`|ZsK7vpOjaa	it takes tow weeks after u have sex kk my sister firend tould me lol|`|AR683Nz6aa	you can take some tests 5 days beofre your period or two weeks after having sex.|`|886YDJEEaa	i know it is hard, but just try not to think about it to much and wait until you are about 5 days away from your period and then take a test (it should be an early detection test, like the clearblue or early response) and if it is negative just take another one in a week or so. if you cant get one of those you should wait till you are a few days late. just keep calm because if you are stressed out to much it can cause your period to be late. good luck
kZRTekoJaa	i think it's a little bit of both.  i have two cats (and two small kids).. my kids LOVE "being sweet" to the cats (carrying them around, petting them, cuddling, etc) but they are not exactly as sweet as they should be lol.. they are rough (not always or usually on purpose) and occasionally get scratched or bitten, but mostly get ran away from.  you might have to teach your child to not be mean or rough with the animals (b/c i also have a nephew who lives with cats and even tho his mom and grandmother are always sweet to their cats he really enjoys purposely being mean to the cats..and he is old enough to know better but was never really made to act better with them)  but more then likely if your child grows up around pets he will "inherit" your love of them..    IF you do not have pets though, they may not be animal lovers. my kids are afraid of every animal out there except cats and squirrels (don't know why squirrels tho).. they don't mind looking at animals from afar (very far lol) but are seriously terrified of any other animal close up. i think my daughter's fear is mostly due to the way my son reacts but i truly do not know where his fear comes from.    hope i helped, sorry if i was a little rambly. :)|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Both|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I think if an animal is there, they will naturally inherit a love for them.    One of my girlfriends absolutely detests cats and would never have one in the home. Subsequently, her 3-year old daughter hates cats too. When she comes to our house she spends the whole time running away from them and screaming that they tried to scratch her.    Don't worry about your baby. He will naturally love animals if you do.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	all kids love animals ..unless they are taught to fear them|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Both really, kids whose parents do not teach them how to be respectful to animals and work with them will lack the skills to appreciate them.  And most folks who don't have parents that are animal lovers do not become ones themselves, but there are some folks who love animals no matter what - but I also think they lack the touch for animals too.    Really, as long as you demonstrate the proper care and respect for animals your child will pick it up too, that's all it takes.   Of course if the child is a psychopath there isn't much you can do, but then again that's incredibly rare.|`|sxecXFgraa	Some children naturally love animals, but you will need to teach him to respect animals.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	We are naturally drawn to cute and cuddly. Children are drawn to almost everything they don't know about. What happens as the kids grow up is another story.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	I think Mostly taught! I love animals too! My mom does as well and we have ALWAYS had pets!! I dont know how you can resist them (dogs and cats) if they are around always and being their cute selves!! :) However, my sister - who grew up in the same house - could care less for them.|`|OxFV92hJaa	I think it's a lil of both, as well as them as individuals simply loving them or not.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	He or she will just copy you and learn from the way you behave.  But I think most kids have an instinctive love for animals anyway  - especially the cute cuddly sort- they instinctively  love teddy bears and cuddly toys, don`t they.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I think it's whether you have animals or not. We always had animals when I was growing up, and I'm a big animal lover. But now we live in an apartment and we just don't have room for an animal, so my sons kind of scared of them. Just because he's not used to them, and he doesn't know how to act around them... he makes me so nervous, I almost wish we had a dog or something so he would understand you can't walk up to them and pull their tail... I have to hoover over him if we go somewhere with animals... so my first thing I'm doing when we get our house done is I'm buying a puppy. But I have friends who never had animals growing up and they truly despise them... so I think animals are something you have to get used to and learn to love.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	That is a hard one.  My mother who raised me does not like animals.  But my father who didn't have part in my life until I was an adult loves animals and so does my two half sisters.   We are all naturally animal people.    So I don't know.   I grew up in a home where no one like animals really but I'm a huge animal lover.    So I don't know.  I think some of it is inherited and some of it is taught.    (We had two dogs when I was growing up both small but that is it and I was completely responsible for feeding them, letting them out. and exercising them)    My father has 4 dogs, 4 horses, and 10 goats    Very different people my parents
lavd3UHmaa	Don't stress.  It's not good for you or baby.  Sperm can last in the body 5 or 6 days.  The likely hood of getting pregnant on your period is slim because at that time, your body is removing the egg that was planted in your uterus.    If you tell this boy it may not be his, the likely hood of him sticking around is slim.    I would go with your doctor's advice - it sounds like she is correct with the timing and the development of the fetus.    Good luck with you and your baby.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Stop stressing, listen to your doctor. If the doctor says it was the 26th that you conceived then that's when it was, or at the very least around when it was. Not three weeks prior.    If you're *really* worried about it, have a DNA test done after the baby's born to confirm paternity with your boyfriend.|`|4WNeBRjVaa	Stop stressing, your pregnant you should be relaxing! Congratulations! It seems like you and your new man are going to be great parents! The doctor is completely right! It's pretty amazing that you got together a day before you conceived!! So don't worry it's the new guys! And sperm can live for up to 72 hours. You have nothing to worry about
ebQJsYTxaa	I agree with Melissa S that family practice doctors are generally more open to vaccination choice than pediatricians.    Here are some resources for finding specific doctors who respect the rights of parents to make vaccine decisions for their children.    http://askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/Vac...    http://mothering.com/discussions/forumdi... (click on the area in which you live, and ask for a referral in that forum).    I do not vaccinate my kids at all.  My kids, ages 5 years and 20 months, are extremely healthy, and I am very happy with my decision to not vaccinate them.    Here is the waiver information for each state, for school and daycare vaccine requirements.  http://mothering.com/discussions/showthr...|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Use a family doctor. My son is getting his first shot(only 1) next week at 11 months. I had trouble just finding a doctor that was ok with delaying and a family doctor seemed to be the best way to go. As a bonus me and my son can both use the same doctor.|`|Sgc81dOAaa	if u love yr baby and want him/her to have a healthy and long life, and u dont want to go in and out of hospitals and have numerous tests done and than have to pay a huge hospital bill., than u must give the vaccinations. ur saying ur having a lot of trouble finding a Dr.? call yr gynae or the hospital u were discharged from. they should be able to give u a list of pediatriacians close to yr residence. act fast and save yr baby.take care|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Omg I'm so sick of this. Ok I agree that not all vaccines are good but come on. Your not going to give your kid a Hep shot? that's just stupid. You'll also have trouble getting them into school unless you have a religious waver.|`|A89ezcg5aa	My husband wanted me to do this in the begining.  I just can't risk my kids getting measles, whooping cough, or hepatitis, nor do I want them making other babies/children/adults sick.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	There is NO medical proof that vaccinations cause autism, or anything else for that matter. And even if it did, you would still be better off with the vaccines because of the chances of getting the illness vs the chances of getting autism. You should research before you make descions like that with your child's life. VACCINES ARE NOT LINKED TO CAUSING ANYTHING HARMFUL TO CHILDREN!|`|2xTV7Ai8aa	i am also a mommy to a healthy 8 month old and i wasn't going to give my daughter her shots but im delaying them till shes a year but didn't have a problem with my doctor but i have a family doctor but i do know if you don't make sure your kids shots are all caught up there are some schools that will not let your kids attend which is understandable i also wasn't going to vaccinating my daughter but do to the bugs going around lately i changed my mind but i do know if you do decide to take that rout they will vaccinate your baby at any time when you believe its time they'll even space out the shots if its your wishes good luck ;)
yPNvecc7aa	Why not just let him drink from a regular cup?    When I was 4 months old I would not take the bottle either. My mom had to use a sippy cup and give me one sip slowly at a time. By 12 months I was using regular cups.  All kids are different. If he doesn't want a bottle, bonus! Some kids never want to get off the bottle! At least you won't have that problem.|`|InZU5aaxaa	I would make sure the liquids are clear. Like water, apple juice, ext. Set cup down low where he can reach it. Teach him he can only drink in one spot. Moving to a big boy cup is like potty training. The child will let you know when they are ready to make the leap.    My friends daughter knew her cup was always on the lower shelf in the fridge, I know he is too young to open but same concept. She loved her drinks cold. She would open fridge, drink a few sips, put back in fridge. She would not run around the house or drink in any other room. She was only allowed to drink on tile floor. Teach them know to help with clean up any accidents that may happen. Good luck.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Get some straws. Many plastic cups have lids with a hole big enough for a straw. You may have to cut the straw down to size.|`|avx7bLnKaa	try a juice box with straw or a cup with a straw    mots has a "mots for tots" juice box that is prediluted with extra water ... put the straw in baby's mouth and gently squeeze|`|AA11755924	well, he just likes to drink from big boy cups.  If that's how he does it, then give it to him like that.|`|BbfNMXtiaa	Just give him a plastic cup with no lid if that's what he prefers. Make sure to keep it in the kitchen with supervision, but there's no reason a 1 year old can't start drinking out of a cup. My friend's daughter has always done that, and only uses a sippy if they are out of the house.|`|B4Cz1vUEaa	My son never drank out of a sippy cup.  He would drink out of a cup.  We eventually got him to drink out of a straw and he skipped the sippy cup stage altogether.  We tried every sippy cup made and bought dozens of different kinds.  We kept the bottle until about 16 months and then he went straight to a straw cup.  He loves drinking out of regular glasses and he uses those at meals and in his high chair and uses a straw cup on the go.  We bought cheap clear plastic glasses that looked like our glass glasses and the cheap disposable straw cups and that is what we have been using since and he is now 26 months old.
33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	I do believe in IVF because it does help people achieve their dream of having a child of their own. Cause there are lots of people out there that would do anything to have a child. And they do decide to have ivf to achieve that dream. But I also believe that there should be a limit on the eggs that they put back into the woman. I do believe that there should be no more than 2 eggs returned to a womans uterus. That away there wouldn't be a chance of having but one or two babies. Because I don't believe that we were made to have litters of babies. That is for dogs and cats to do. But we were only  made to carry one or two babies. And besides if you have more than 3 you really cant give them the time and attention that each one needs. And triplets and higher order multiples are usually born several weeks early and need lots of medical attention. And who likes to see a baby suffer? I sure don't! So yes I do believe in IVF but I do believe that the government needs to put a stop in these doctors that put more than 2 eggs in a woman to be fertilized.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Speaking from the point of someone who has a wonderful little boy due to the miracle of IVF.  I would say yes.  Not that your question made any sense to begin with. For some women it is the only way that they will ever get pregnant.|`|4DoXomHZaa	No, it's not natural. Babies aren't meant to be conceived outside the womb. There's many unnatural things that are very commonplace today.    Then there's the fact that those embryos created  are babies....as the other lady said, situations to have "litters" need to be avoided....however, what does one do with the remaining babies that were not implanted? The only options are donate, sell, or throw away. I can't imagine throwing away or selling or donating my babies.     And if the fertility docs themselves tell you those 8 celled embryos are in fact your children, how are they ever considered not children at the developmental stage when they are conceived inside the womb?|`|mgiJVjaKaa	A lot of what we do isn't "natural." It isn't natural to have surgery to remove your appendix, it isn't natural to take antidepressants or birth control, it isn't natural to have a c-section or epidural or take prenatal vitamins, it isn't natural to undergo chemotherapy to try and get rid of cancer.    So yes, I think IVF is fine, but I do think it should be done keeping the safety of the mom *and* the potential babies in mind. Which means not setting up a situation where a woman could get pregnant with 7 babies.|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Ain't is not a word first of all, and second of all IVF is a form of conception for those who can't conceive naturally.|`|ZK7JztHyaa	this is a very hard question....i think its unethical for a women to have 8 embryos implanted into her uterus but as far as IVF being allowed....it's easy for someone who has never gone through infertility to say "oh no.....it shouldn't be allowed...."    then there are people like me....i have no children and i have been trying for a child for 8 years.....we just found out that my husband has low sperm count along with the shape and movement.    they think our only hope is IVF with ICSI....are u going to tell me i wasnt meant to have a child? it's just not right.    because we cannot afford IVF(this is what we should be talking about, why can they charge so much) we will likely be doing donor inseminations.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	IVF isn't giving birth. Its a conception method.
4DoXomHZaa	7 weeks as in past conception or as in since your last period? Either way the tests should show + by now unless you are the 1 in a million woman that does not excrete hcg into urine.    Get a blood test and in the mean time act as tho you are--don't do anything risky, drink, etc.    Runny nose and sneezes are absolutely not pregnancy signs. The others can be, but are also PMS signs too.|`|GcJszsMnaa	You maybe.. But good luck hun!|`|yRi1tjO6aa	yes there's still a chance. You can't always rely on those pregnancy tests. maybe try another brand or go to your doctor to do a simple urine test.|`|BmFjxbqAaa	I think it sounds like a common cold to me. I did not think you are pregnant. I would wait for another week and then take one more. And see what that one says if it is neg then go get some NyQuil and take a does and do to sleep you should feel better when you wake up. Let me know .
tVqLmImUaa	Only difference would be:<br>  <br>  a) pregnant women often tend to pee more often<br>  b) pregnant women often take pre-natal vitamin supplements, and these supplements can make pee bright yellow.<br>  <br>  Otherwise no difference at all.|`|ZiXScLmhaa	There is no way of telling the difference of urine if ur pregnant|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Somebody lied to you.

You can tell with a test, and in your 3rd trimester you pee constantly but by then you KNOW your pregnant.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Nope, no noticeable difference.  There will be hormones that your can test for through the urine, but the human eye will notice no change.  You will find yourself peeing more often though!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	It will be interesting to see the answers to this... My pee has smelled different ever since I got pregnant lol. I was wondering if it was just me.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No visible difference.  If there were, you wouldn't need tests.

5ZvALiclaa	You can feed him whatever you like now. You can stop buying jarred baby food and just modify regular food for him. Still do not add salt, sugar or anything like that to his food if its avoidable.<br>  <br>  when my older two were at that age, maybe a little older, i would make a normal dinner for us and set aside a portion for the baby/toddler to eat the next night (except if it was spicy or something) and just reheat it for him. If he couldn't eat what we were having i used a jar of food or had some premade meals for him the freezer to heat up. Sometimes they still can't eat all what we are having so you still need to have back ups like jars and frozen food at hand, also if you are going out.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|UfOP3xtcaa	If he seems to be doing well on the ppl food then i would say that you are okay to switch him over. I would do it gracefully thought. slowly take the baby food away.|`|TJezsCkHaa	Give him what he likes,if he wants our food and you think he won't choke on it,go ahead.He is ready for ppl food!|`|AOvtRBU9aa	Now! He can have whatever you're eating now. Even food with milk in it, just not milk. Some people just skip baby food/ purees altogether and go straight to "ppl food"!|`|pXSKSS3daa	You can leave the jarred foods behind if he's doing well on table foods. My son is 10 and a half months old and the only time I spoon feed him is in the mornings(yogurt) and at night before bed(applesauce). Otherwise his snacks and dinner are table foods that he feeds himself.
YUNE5QReaa	I think you should go in to the labour ward with an open mind. I used the gas with my daughter and nothing with my son.<br>  <br>  They have lots of equipment to help the pain and the gas works wonderfully, talk to your midwives at your next antinatal check up and they can help you work out what best suits you.<br>  <br>  I too didn't want a needle.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Here, the options are Gas and Air, Pethidine or the Epidural.<br>  <br>  I myself didn't like the idea of an epidural either....I have nothing against those that had them of course! But for me, walking around really helped with my labour, and an epidural would have stopped that.<br>  (Here, they do not offer the 'walking epidural')<br>  <br>  I did have a half shot of the pethidine, and ended up loathing myself for having it.<br>  I don't remember a good chunk of my son's birth, because that drug made me so loopy and tired, not to mention ill.<br>  <br>  Next time, I'm going to study up on some more natural alternatives!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I was given Demoral when I had pre-term labor. It's a shot in the thigh. It hurt for a few days because I jumped (I was 26 weeks and had a severe hike in my HR so it was an emergency shot) <br>  <br>  Im sure if you are still and know it's comming that you won't jump like I did.|`|AA11100991	The epidural actually goes between the discs rather than into the spine like the spinal. I have had both. When I had the epidural, I had to lean forward. The worst part was the sting of what they used to deaden the area. I was in so much pain at the time, because of the contractions, though, that this was minor and then I was able to just relax. I had three births before this, completely without pain relief. With the epidural, I could breathe, read, laugh, relax...it was worth the brief stinging. The spinal was different because I had to have a c-section. I was not having contractions at the time, because the babies were taken at 32 weeks. I can't remember at all what it felt like. All I know is that neither experience was bad and if I could have another (which I wouldn't now anyway, lol), I would definitely use an epidural again.|`|FWqK710Yaa	I felt  the same way. I used some of the nitrous gas. It doesn't really take the pain away but alters your perception of the pain. I was also offered demerol shots with gravol but I also wanted something that wouldn't be passed to my baby. The gas worked really well for me, I kept telling my Aunt "this is good s#@$", and I have never swore in front of her in my life! Of course that is the new family joke! Good luck.|`|8HIybjKXaa	for the epidural you just have to sit still for the same amount of time as a normal shot, idk if there's anything else, but epidurals work really well
dN5BJeVpaa	I love that name.<br>  I love Margot, and I love Margaux. <br>  But Margot is so much more common in the US & UK. <br>  <br>  It is really cute, but it's also really mature and sophisticated - but short and sweet, which makes it really nice. <br>  <br>  The only thing is some dumb people say mar-got, so annoying!|`|8KrMSB8Eaa	i feel so bad for that child|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	ewww|`|bvnSjdmeaa	to many ways to make fun of it, you know how mean kids are|`|iMtGIiMQaa	cute! unique. i like it.|`|bkKHjozQaa	it's not my favorite name ever. sorry!|`|YgzpSbxdaa	I think it's ok. I'd rather just take the 't' off all together rather than make it silent. It's less confusing that way.|`|AA12254690	ewwww no one is going to know that the t is silent so mar-got is hidious! and its close to mago ewwww|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	It seems a bit pretentious to me - not sure why. I've never liked it much, but I can see how it'd be cute on a little girl.|`|mndpyoV1aa	The name is cute but the spelling is not cute at all. If your gonna use that name just spell it normal Margo. <br>  .|`|LzzTpVEUaa	Definitely no. Imagine yourself in her place when she gets older.|`|k8sukeTbaa	It's a nickname for Margaret.  I'm not crazy about it, but if you like it, then use it.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Go with Riley Belle istead!|`|D9IbINdFaa	I think it's an ugly name|`|QBFbvO21aa	honestly it sounds like maggot. <br>  it's not that cute. sorry :/|`|bgKitk9paa	I don't care for it.|`|SVt2Fyi9aa	sounds like an old persons name.|`|8f3431a2722a7125fc72c2f618253f5aaa	I like it, the french spell Margaret as Margot, and I personally think it's a lot prettier than Margaret.<br>  If I was having more children I might use it as a middle name, because it's lovely and unique. I don't think I'd use it as a first name, or if I did I would spell it Margaux - no doubt it would still get mangled, but not to the extent that some of the idiots here would mispronounce it.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	I like it. Although someone in my family is a Margaret. So.... One thing I would suggest is drop the "t". It will be easier to pronounce and spell for when she is around people outside of the family. Also it is unique, easy to spell and pronounce (without the "t"). I think it is very nice. <br>  <br>  I understand what you mean. I wanted to name my daughter if I had one Payden. I first heard it when I was picking my brother up a daycare. The name really stuck with me. Although now it is a fairly common name.|`|WWsvtX3qaa	I think that any name that calls out to you should be the name that you choose for your baby.  In my personal opinion though Margot sounds like the name of a woman over 30, not a toddler or young girl.  But please remember strangers on the internet shouldn't name your baby, you should.|`|ylCIg7hPaa	its a one of a kind name<br>  you should try your own one of a kind name you never know i personally wanna have a son named lalala|`|MikhcVZfaa	What about giving her the official name Margaret and just using Margot as a nickname?|`|GzXDRRYLaa	very cute|`|yoS4PaQzaa	i kind of like it...but i think it'll need a really good middle name or last name for it to really work.|`|NJTN3Pb0aa	Don't really like it. i think its old fashioned or something|`|f2osf2iNaa	It reminds me of Fargo.<br>  I don't really feel fuzzy about it.|`|IbNreJ2haa	sounds like maggot|`|uS07WAwcaa	The name is pronounced Mar Go not Mar Got (which is prob why some people think it sounds like Maggot)<br>  It is a German name<br>  I think that it is pretty because it reminds me of a different version of the name Megan/Meggan (however you want to spell it)<br>  <br>  hope that helps :)|`|dPULl5hjaa	Nope!|`|mZi7R0Enaa	great choice!|`|35JIECGRaa	I love that name ... you just reminded me of a character from the Babysitter's Club named that, except it was spelled Margo (no T). It can be really pretty depending on the spelling ... when I first saw it, I was like "mar-got, eww" (reminded me of maggot), but then I saw the pronunciation and was like "Love it!" :)|`|ENANtueuaa	I'm not a big fan of the silent T...kinda makes it look like maggot. MY cousin's name is Margeaux, pronounced the same way. I think it's a cute name, and it's always fit her. She was also a really cute little girl :)|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	awesome name ..my booze buddy is a Margot! And she's little and cute too!!|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Too close to maggot.<br>  Skip it.|`|5d573e43d278a547e9503d25ae2fcc31aa	I don't really like it all that much.|`|sVg4Qco0aa	I like it. Say it with a French accent, it sounds good.<br>  <br>  Jeesh. The people who think the 't' is pronounced are fools.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I went to school [[elementary!!]] with a girl named Margot. She was adorable, L0l. Her name was Margot Cutler.. And yes, I loved her name. She was a couple grades bellow me, and sooo adorable. Aha. I love that name.

But pronounced the same. =]<br>  ~Violet <br>  -x-|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Margot's not a bad name I don't think. <br>  I remember reading a book and the main character's name was Margot. <br>  (Pronounced like Margo right?)<br>  Better than the ridiculous names people seem to be giving their children these days.<br>  <br>  Sounds perfectly fine when people know how to read ;]|`|VQoNUTQwaa	hmmmm<br>  well personally i dont like it<br>  it sounds like "amargo"<br>  which is bitter<br>  in spanish<br>  anyways<br>  if you really like<br>  it go for it:)<br>  <br>  i love the name abigail <br>  by the way :)|`|NNki7qiFaa	I love that name, it's cute.|`|PuRpsENEaa	Pronounced Mar Go right?

W4O4rcv9aa	Give your period a few more days it may have pushed you back and you stomach could be hurting because you are suppose to start ..... i would give it about a week and then if i didn't start i would go to the doctor.|`|dh8tR3pwaa	Sometimes sperm can can divert a period. Being that you had unprotected sex can sometimes give you the physical illusion of being pregnant So before you jump to any conclusions visit your physican that is the best way of finding out.|`|AA11141706	most likely...you did do it during your most fertile time...or at least a few days away form it...|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Darling, nobody here is psychic.<br>  <br>  Get a pregnancy test.Stop having sex.Please.Stay in school (especially pay attention in English class) and save sex for when you can take responsibility and are knowledgeable on how to protect yourself during sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|alJA3jyCaa	It's too early to tell, wait a least 2 more days to test.

DDYwnut6aa	Your beta number should have doubled in that time.  So yes, that is likely what is happening.  At that early stage you may or may not have cramping.  I'm sorry.|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	sorry so sorry but that whats happening, it happen to me before the dr is right|`|ilZkHdKcaa	I dont want to get your hopes up but your numbers did go up. I have read that your hcg should double every 48 hrs. it was only 36 hours for you. So I think there is still hope!!!!!!! Your numbers went up not down. I had a very early miscarriage my HCG was at 91 then fell down to 37 in 48 hrs. So hopefully there is still some hope. Hang in there..Google misdiagnosed miscarriage.|`|SUT3yL0oaa	Sounds like you did have an early miscarriage. Cramping does not always accompany bleeding that early in pregnancy. Sorry about your loss|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Yeah if ur bleeding for 4 days, you're having a miscarriage or already had it,sorry!
U4JNn07waa	Everyones body adjust to pregnancy differently and for the first few months you can look really big due to bloating and increased stomach fluids..With me one day I looked 6months pregnant and the next looked 3months because of bloating..your baby is not abnormally big..|`|QSodlfMraa	your bloated that can happen early on in pregnancy.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Are you a little chubby to begin with?  Maybe that's why.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I had the same problem - i really popped out at 8weeks - i looked at least 5-6months.<br>  <br>  Usually if you are thin to start with this may happen.

How tall are you?  Short women show a lot more because there's less room inside for the baby.

( :|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	Are you bloated? That's the only thing i can think of if you are really alot fatter than you used to be.  Unless you have just always been really skinny and just think you're big when you aren't.  I'm 18 weeks and i got big within the last few weeks but didn't really gain much my first trimester.  (I got tired and didn't feel so great but never actually got sick so it's not bc of that.)  I don't know.  I've heard that if you eat like a teenage boy then you're probably having one, so have you been eating alot?  Maybe you've just gained weight from that?  Those are my best guesses.  Hope this helped some.|`|eYxPkgTVaa	It could be from bloating. Did you know that woman who have phantom pregnancies can actually get a baby-belly just from bloating, 'cause their mind tricks their body into producing pregnancy symptoms. Maybe you're carrying twins, but even then I don't think you'd get that big that quickly. Maybe you're doctor can provide an answer. Good luck|`|hMU0OJq1aa	Are you measuring big? Is your doctor worried? If your doctor is ok with your size then everything is fine. Some people just carry all out front and maybe you are just a lil bloated due to all the hormones surging through your body right now. If Doc says its ok, then its ok. Its ok to look a little bigger. Your pregnant. enjoy your belly, even if your are only 10 weeks...who cares?

4BBjhHAnaa	I think some people are afraid that they will be seen as abusive (physically or emotionally/verbally) or mean.  Ever since it became a "no-no" to spank your child, people are at a loss as to how to discipline.<br>  <br>  I a proud to say my parents did a pretty good job.  I know I was a holy terror at times, and didn't listen to them when they told me to stop.  But they certainly made an effort!!<br>  <br>  It is absolutely ridiculous and I don't see any excuse for it.  Children, from the time they are born, should be given boundaries (no hair pulling, biting when they are babies, all the way up to how when they can see their bf/gf when they are a teen), and discipline should always be consistent.  <br>  <br>  I think the people with kids who behave this way don't do very well at disciplining their kids at home, either.  The only way they know how to do things is to have a screaming match and try to make their kids sit in time out.  Hard to do that in public with out making even more of a scene!!!   I think these parents would benefit from watching just one episode of Supernanny!  She always has to explain the importance of consistent boundaries and discipline.<br>  <br>  As for the teachers and such . . . I tried to be a VBS teacher for some pre-schoolers one year.  It was awful!!!  Most of the kids were just fine, but there were these three little hooligans . . . a pair of twin boys and a little girl who was their friend and ring leader.  I was terrified of punishing them!!!  I was only 17 and I had no idea what these kids' parents would say if they found out I yelled at their kids!!!  It was a nightmare.<br>  I would hope that teachers have better training than that, but with the way parents can be these days, maybe they feel it is better to  piss off the public than risk their career on some angry parents.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It sucks, hopefully things will change with the next generation of parents (as if).|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I noticed something in those two scenarios....NOBODY did anything.The people who were responsible for the kids and the onlookers.<br>  <br>  Say something next time.<br>  <br>  <br>  My niece is allowed to do anything she wants at her mother's house.Hit, curse and throw a fit (she is not even five!) but when she is over at my house and I have her in public, she doesn't pull that crap with me because she knows I don't tolerate it.<br>  <br>  I have told her mom things time and time again about how to handle certain situations with her daughter but she never listens (a young mom who would rather be out with boyfriends rather than with her child)|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Because too many people are willing to run to CPS and say they saw someone verbally abusing (yelling at) or beating (spanking) a child. Every oness scared of their kids getting taken away, so they figure no discipline is better than state involvement.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I was in the laundry mat today and  fat gross woman with her fat dirty faced kid came in being loud and obnoxious ..The Mom spoke and yelled at the 5 yr old nonstop as I glared at her. She then says 'I;ll beat your *** here I aint afraid of no one here"  So I piped up " If you do I will put your head through the wall lady" "if you dont want the kid give her to me" She didnt say another word|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Laziness...it is a cultural phenomenon.|`|72zc27Qcaa	Well, first off, I think you should change the tittle of your question, you're showing people how closed minded you are  by generalizing when u say "Why are people so bad at parenting now, no one disciplines their child about inappropriate behaviour in public?".........I dont know where you live or your surroundings, but where I live (SO California) "People" now a days are not how you portrait them in your question, Yes! some  persons really suck at parenting, some others try their best. But dont say NO ONE disciplines their children. I assume you dont have any kids, otherwise you would be a little more respectful  to the great job some of us have.  We raise persons with a mind of their own, we cant control them like you would control a robot, and much less if some noisy uncle/aunt/friend gives them some sugar. I can not tell you why kids on your area behave like that, but I could think why, i mean both scenarios sound boring for children, so no wonder why they act out, and yes they show to be children because thats what they are. <br>  My son is a 3yr old, he's gone on flights from CA to Germany (13hr flight) and he knows better he is not supposed to kick seats or anything else that is not "kickable". And even with his 3yrs of age he knows how  to respect others; so now u tell me how is it that "people" this days dont know how to raise/discipline their children, when u alone dont even know how the job gets done.<br>  Dont take it to the heart, but just dont walk through life assuming all parents are bad at parenting just because u had some bad encounters with some children; suck it up, not all of us are that bad at parenting, u'll see soon ;)|`|fIfQdhqFaa	Ugh, I know all about that. Every retail store I worked in had little hell raisers running around the store knocking our customers over and parents just watching them do it, or when the parents come in with their kid to buy a phone or ipod and we don't have the exact color they want and they throw a fit the size of WWII while the parent grovels at their feet. I always felt like telling them to put their kids on leashes or ship them to military school to learn discipline. I don't understand it. Not sure why. Lazy parents.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Do something about it.  Volunteer.<br>  <br>  Volunteer with kids obviously.  Be a role model.  The more positive role models (and less whiners) in kid's lives, the better.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	because you have people in here who post questions saying "I saw someone yelling at their kid today and blah blah blah I was about to walk up and tell them that is NOT cool" or CPS gets called if you even grab your child in public.....<br>  I feel your pain, I was in the movie Marely and Me the other day and this lady had like 8 kids with her that kept getting up and walking around the movie theater and talking loudly and making jokes, it was so annoying. <br>  <br>  People are afraid to discipline their children in public now days...it's too bad.
Ve0Wl3QNaa	My son did this when he was 2 months old also. I was so nervous. I called the doctor and she said he was foing through a growth spurt and needed the sleep. Of course call the doctor if you still are nervous, it might ease your mind. Good luck!|`|SDjrojZXaa	honestly he is probably just going through a growing spurt where they kind of just want to sleep and not eat as much...i would try offering him more frequent but less with oz for peice of mind that he is getting his fluids but it is probably perfectly fine however, if he seems to be lathargic then i would call the doctor. EDIT: 4 diareahs are not really severe one an hour would be considered severe....but under 3 months you should probably take her to the doctor just in case then|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	It`s normal. My little `Princess` is now 13 months and 22 days. When she was within 9 months, she slept alot. She usually had 1 or 2 pools per day. She fed a lot of S26 milk powder. 3 - 4 bottles per day. While she was not well 1 to 1.5 bottle per day and every 2 days pool pool once.<br>  Very important thing that she must sleep well. She was very sensitive to sounds around her.   The flushing of the toilet and the drippling of the tap water not to mention about the motor vehicles......

pzLDXL6gaa	When they want to. I've had some friends do it at 12/13. Though they are atheists now. But I would leave it up to a child to choose, even though it's not harmful, it would just seem weird doing that.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AA10789216	All three of mine were baptized at 8 years old.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	This may be dependent upon your religion and the traditional practices.<br>  We had our son christened at just over three weeks (which is actually quite young for it) - simply because if it wasn't done before Advent prior to Christmas, it would have had to have waited til the new year.<br>  <br>  For answerers who don't know what christening is - its definition is giving a Christian name to a child at Baptism. Sometimes the two words are used interchangeably.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	It depends upon your faith. As a Catholic, I believe that a child is to be baptized, at latest, before turning a month old. Baptism removes the stain of original sin and provides an indelible mark of God upon the child. And it does not remove their choices in the future. If a child becomes and adult and wants to follow a different path, it would be disappointing and painful of course, but it would be the child's choice.<br>  <br>  By the way, a ship is "christened". We do not break champagne bottles across the heads of children.<br>  <br>  Edit: Lydia, we obviously know what the question asker meant. The two words are rarely used interchangeably these days, in fact I do not know of a faith that refers, anymore, to baptism, the correct Biblical word for the act, as "christening".|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I don't believe in getting children christened. It usually takes away their choice of religion. Like if you baptize the Catholic, when they ar eolder they will feel as though they have to be Catholic and maybe they want to be something else. I like to keep the options open for them. I will teach my daughter all about God and the Bible, but I won't pick her religion for her.|`|nqcnylFpaa	you going to smash a champagne bottle over the kids head well that's just mean but i don't know i am an atheist and my wife is a buddhist but i guess it depends on the religion really|`|bdWO9wSAaa	My parents baptized me in a Lutheran Church when I was a baby. I don't believe in God at all. So much for that =P
loqsl5xXaa	are you sure you know it is him saying this? If it is then write him back saying something like my mom says she will think about it, but if i can go i think my mom will make me take her or my dad. that way your not lying you are giving him a heads up on what she may say. <br>  <br>  go to her after u hear back from him letting you know if its ok if she has to come. then talk to her about it saying. I msg so n so a guy who is in the band and he says he will let me in for nothing (saves you money) and he says its totally ok too if you come, he says he is sure you would be worried about me and he understood that.<br>  <br>  so can i go. remind her she can come and doesnt have to pay for the tickets. just dont do anything till u hear from him.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	well ... ask the guy and tell him you cant come unless a parent comes too ... ask if thats okay ... and tell him if not then thats okay ... then if thats all good tell your mom the singer can get you in.|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	i think your out of luck.<br>  sorry, my mother would never let me get in if i told her that story , unless i lied. but thats just parents. <br>  &<br>  idk about the singer letting a parent in<br>  goodluck :]|`|3w7VztEWaa	You don't drive??? do you have friends that drive???<br>  have one of them to go with you but make sure they pay for thier way in...<br>  he can get you cuz he is in the band..<br>  I get in free to all my shows cuz my boyfriend is in the band that plays.<br>  so if you dont think your parents will let you go just say your hanging with your friend.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Yeah... sure.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? No, I wouldn't. I would make it clear without making it obvious that I could accept anyone for being straight or homosexual, or bi for that matter. It wouldn't bother me. ?¤·?|`|70744bc4be63015a2ec2bfa99decb962aa	I dont know thats tough, I would always try to keep supporting my child in anyway.  but at that age I'd say it were a phase and let them be who they are.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GXM74MGPaa	How exactly can you talk them out of being homosexual? Can I talk you out of being straight? No.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	You cannot talk someone out of being homosexual just like you cannot talk someone out of being straight.<br>  <br>  Its not a choice.You are what you are.<br>  <br>  You, as a parent can either accept your child as he/she is or you can be ignorant and abandon your child.<br>  <br>  It really is the parents' choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***Also, for the ignorant being saying that it is "unanatural" you should really get educated.<br>  <br>  Homosexualty is natural in nature.<br>  <br>  Sheep, dolphins, fruit bats, penguins, orangutans and beetles have all shown homosexual and bisexual tendancies.<br>  <br>  And I also never went through a homosexual phase.You either are or you aren't (or you are just plain bi)|`|qiVE00ecaa	No, unless your some fanatic christian who would abandon him.  Have a little respect for people that different then you, you ignorant christian bible-thumper.|`|mggll8dRaa	For Sure, that is too young to be involved with that matter;<br>  Children ween't as promiscuous (openly) at that Young age 30 Yrs. ago....!!|`|T3BXC8qXaa	No, that's something that just "is" ....you can't talk someone out of it.....|`|e782afed89cc03df5992da9a17af2969aa	no<br>  you dont want them to think about suicide so just help them to survive the hard years|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Hi<br>  <br>  I am 13 years old. You simply cannot talk a child out of being homosexual, it is who they are. Its like trying to talk me out of having freckles. <br>  <br>  Do you have a 14 year old child that is acting gay? Well if you do, the second "You should really reconsider liking the same sex" comes out of your mouth, he/she is gone. You should support him/her because it is a very tough time for him/her. <br>  <br>  I am straight, and was born that way. Gay people are gay, because they are born that way.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I would never try to talk my child out of being what he is comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Unless he's into bestiality or pedophilia, I say the heart wants what it wants. No reason to change that.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	No. You cannot talk them out of it. Being a homosexual is not the end of the world. Your child was born that way and you should love them no matter what.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Hell no.<br>  It's their life.<br>  You can't really talk someone out of being gay/lesbian anyway. :/ It doesn't work like that. If you think it does, you have some growing up to do.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Of course and without question. Presumably I would like my child so would naturally want their life to be as happy well adjusted and fulfilling as possible.|`|q4kEXT9maa	No, I wouldnt try to talk the child out of it.  I would show acceptence to the child.|`|PI3ETyQ0aa	that's horrible, you could ruin their life! what if they just act strange and are straight, think of the blow to their self esteem!|`|S3t69kh2aa	No, you should give unconditional love.|`|XqqLlBe4aa	No. dont try to change the way someone is. it's like telling a black person to be white. it's not cool.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	No I wouldn't try to talk them out of it. i love all my children regardless.|`|Mlf7Kss4aa	hell yeah|`|SimAO1IUaa	NOPE!! of course if i had a kid, i would definately secretly be upset if they were homosexual but anways dont try to talk them out of it because if you do, they wont be honest with you and hide it from you if they really are homosexual because they know you dont approve. just wait it out and if htye are, theres nothing you can do to talk them out of it.|`|E80oq8bIaa	uhh no becouse if they are really homosexual you cant talk them out of it and trying will probably get them to hide it from you wich will probably screw them up later in life <br>  <br>  and if you can talk them out of it then it was just a phase wich means they would of grown out of it anyways so there was no reason for you to make them feel like if they were it would be a bad thing|`|cIn8BkYHaa	It's for the best to just accept who they are and who they may become. It's possible they could be attracted to the same sex or not. But it will cause a lot of tension and resentment if parents aren't okay with what life their children choose, sexual preference is really nothing compared to the other things they could get into. I would rather my child be gay then addicted to drugs or something.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	Personally, I wouldn't if it was my child. That is something they would need to decide for themselves. I would support whatever they would decided and give them advice and how I felt about it (if asked by them) but I would make it clear it was their decision.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	I'm 14 and tried coming out to my mother, and she told me I was disgusting and I had to be straight because everyone else in my family is straight.<br>  <br>  I've ended up very much disliking and resenting my mother. I'd suggest to mothers that it'd be best to leave your child the way they are.<br>  <br>  Ever heard of Bobby Griffith? His parents learned he was gay, and their ignorance and wanting to change him led to his suicide.|`|ACCIArkDaa	Nope..He/she has to come and talk to me about their sexuality before I make the assumption..Not all gentures means he/she is a homo..<br>  <br>  Prime example, I have a nephew who is definately "gay".  From the time he was 5 years old, the family noticed his female traits.  The family spoke to my sister that we saw these motions in her son but she was in denial.  My nephew played with boys' toys and have gone on junior dates.  We the family never talk to him about his female traits until he came out of the closet at 18 years old.  Now he wanted us to listen to him.  We listen and we asked questions.  Some of us condenm him for his sexuality.  My nephew told us what his inner feelings about young men.  He didn't leave out any details when the family asked and he us our answers.  <br>  <br>  One thing that has stayed in my mind when he told me that he had these feelings since he was 8 years old now he's 20.  I'm not here to judged my nephew but to love him...He's accountable for his own actions when he sees his creator.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	no.. try and be as supportive of him/her. if you push them to be something their not it will put a wall between you. you may not agree with it, but remember, your child is a different human being than you are. and has their own thoughts and feelings. Don't make them feel ashamed but encourage whatever feelings they have|`|QikvnTnqaa	I'm not sure. I think at 14 they are just learning what that means. I think they would still be considered a kid and have time to really "decide."<br>  <br>  I wouldn't really care. I would want my kids to be happy. I would think it's kinda "odd" and it would probably bug me for a while. But as long as they are happy that's ok with me.|`|oem5yEUDaa	No, it is more than likely just a phase anyway. I'm sure most people during their teens go through a phase where they are confused about their sexuality, it's all about finding yourself and growing up. If he does turn out to be gay so what? He likes what he likes.|`|vtFbGgTRaa	It's probably a phase they they may grow out of or may not. I would be concerned because of how society will treat them if they are gay but I won't make them ashamed of it|`|To5mQxOPaa	that doesn't make sense. you can't talk someone out from the way they were born. i guess i would just ask them about it.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	yes, duh!!!. too much tv and movies and public schools push that it is ok to be gay.....tell him the truth....it is not natural .....|`|YXUmCjJaaa	Definitely not.<br>  <br>  For three reasons: one - what good would it do? If they were really homosexual, NOTHING would change that.<br>  Two - By trying to 'talk them out of it', they would feel that I was unaccepting of the way they were made, henceforth, would probably cause them to resent me or something of the sort. I wouldn't want that.<br>  and three - I love my child and will love them NO MATTER WHAT.|`|AIaiRwHGaa	Don't, i am openly gay and when my parents found out they tried to convince me that i am not, and this lead to things being awkward for a long time. if you get worked up with him about it then he will just get angry with you.|`|8E2mqa8Haa	of course i would not<br>  its their choice and that wouldnt make them any different they would still be human being they would make mistakes like all of us and learn from them<br>  and besides its their life not mine so why should i worry about it<br>  i would worry about their safety because u never know what could happen if someone found out someone who  didnt like homosexuals|`|pS3h9TZBaa	I'm not a parent, but as a teen I would say talking your child out of it probably won't work. If they truly are, they might just feel alienated by you.
24f969b02a5ea25351be932405126b28aa	yes he could be teething. my son started teething at a month. they have the numbing jel you can use that and tylenol if your pediatrician gives the ok. dont' let them tell you your baby is too young to be teething cause thats what mine said and by 3 months my son had 1 tooth with a 2nd almost in|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	Give him teething tablets. You can buy them at a drug store or a grocery store. You give the baby about three tablets every few hours. Baby orajel would work great if the baby would stay still while you put it on them. Mys son starting teething at 3 months and is still teething at 7 months with no teeth.  But when they are screaming teething tablets work great. They will relax them a little and after the baby will probably got to sleep.  Good Luck|`|gCkVFu9Saa	Yes he could be teething. My daughter started early about 2months old! She was dribbling & chewing everything in sight. However her first teeth didnt come through until 5 & 1/2 months.<br>  <br>  I found that Ashton & Parsons teething powders were a life saver & also Dentinox teething gel was good as well.<br>  <br>  I was also told that you can get a clean flannel soak it in cooled boiled water & then pop it into the freezer. Once frozen let your son chew on it and it helps to comfort him.<br>  <br>  HTH x|`|5633e8191b884e0bdc24b085089f5122aa	Yup.  I know someone who got teeth at that age(his mother continued to breastfeed, the saint!). I used Teething Tablets.  I found them at Walmart and they are all natural if that is something you focus on.  Before bed, you can give him Tylenol to help the pain through the night.  Crushed ice in a washcloth is a good teething toy, also.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	yes he could well be, call your doc and see what dose of tylenol you can give for the pain....believe me, i hate to 'dope' my dd , but when i see her so distressed, it is a small price to pay for her to feel better....|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, he could be teething.<br>  <br>  Teething Medicine—from a mother of six<br>  <br>  Sprinkle sugar on a thin slice of onion.  Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate 15-20 minutes.  It will start to dissolve.  Put some of the gel on the baby's gums.  It's magic!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
U4JNn07waa	I'm 19weeks 4days myself with my first! and I feel the exact same pains as you do at times it feels like alot of pressure pushing down..I asked my doctor about them and he said they are perfectly normal..He also recommended that I drink plenty of water/fluids to avoid dehydration because this can cause braxton hicks and discomfort or pain and early childbirth in extreme cases|`|4kX61Y97aa	hi im 20w 4d i have experianced this since bout 16 weeks i asked my midwife she said the baby may be adding pressure to the lovwer of the womb also when i went to the scan the lady there told me the baby is low but nothing to worry about as when he gets bigger he wont be able to add any more pressure also she said something about our body may practice contractions(bracston hicks?) but she said not worry so dont worry about it atm your baby is moving around kicking in uncomftable areas but hopefully it wont be for long =]<br>  <br>  all the best and congrats|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Does it hurt worse when you urinate?   I could just be round ligament pain from it stretching, or it could be your pelvic symphasis (where the pelvic bones meet in the middle of your pubis) dislocating - but it's early in your pregnancy for that.   At your visit part of the routine things is to check your urine for a UTI, so that will be ruled out (they are common and can be devastating in pregnant women).  If it's your pubic symphasis you need to tone up your muscles as it's only going to get worse, but as I said it's very early for that.
lzUF22l0aa	actually i found a buy buy baby in nj. So that does help i dont know exactly what part but buy buy baby was near cherry hill maybe you can find one close to you.. good luck|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Baby Gap, but I think that's only for clothes. Also, once upon a child has a lot of gently used things. I love that store!|`|GLfsQ9P7aa	Depends on where you live.  I love GOORES.  Located in Sacramento CA.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	There are a few buy buy baby stores we have one here in Wayne too.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	USA Baby|`|4TNavgDuaa	I know that inside toysRus has baby stuff too but mostly the same stuff as BabiesRus. I also went to Sears they have a baby department that sells all kinds of baby stuff.
PTdy6TWRaa	Of those extendable beds I like the Leksvik. They go from a size for a toddler mattress and extend for the size of a single/twin mattress so standard bedding in toddler size, and then later in single/twin size would do the job.
1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	Too early to tell. The blood test measures hCG, which is only detectable about 11 days after conception. <br>  <br>  And about conception: you may be able to conceive 4-5 days before ovulation and 1-2 days after, and the sperm may survive an average of 3-5 days in the fallopian tubes prior to fertilization. So give yourself a window of a few days rather than exactly 11; you don't conceive the day you have sex. <br>  <br>  And please don't let these people tell you what to do. Get the blood test if you suspect that you may be pregnant, just give it at least another week to be sure you'll get an accurate result.|`|W4MJiYYfaa	I'd suggest waiting it out for at least a week or so, that way your more likely to get a definate answer. You wouldn't want to be pregnant, go and have the test not be able to catch it, just to do something silly that could harm your child.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry!|`|TbV5gBqYaa	No, you should wait 7-10 days after.. I did and my test came up fuzzy but even if the test has two lines and one is lighter then the other, your still pregnant.. and all i have to say is if u are, dont b scared u can email me and i can talk with you, i made the mistake of being scared and did something stupid and didnt have the baby.. And now that I am pregnant again, i might be having a miscarriage, i feel like i'm being punished for it. So, stay calm and dont worry. I was in that position too.. If you need someone to talk to, plz. email me and ask me ANYTHING! jus go to my profile and email me k? best of luck..|`|29gHY4U6aa	You can't usually tell for a couple of weeks at least. I know for me, I can tell a little early because my breasts get SUPER tender. A blood test is the most reliable test you can take, but an at home test is still pretty good and might give you piece of mind.|`|ZiXScLmhaa	I understand u wanna find out like now but maybe u should relax and wait a lil longer and then after that go to the clinic|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Try to wait a week or so then go to the clinic but do it early.|`|ofNidLvVaa	You should take the morning after pill. Go to the drug store|`|QSodlfMraa	no you can not it takes up to 2 weeks for implantation.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	ummm no it take a week just to conceve, there is no way to know after only a few days|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No, they won't be able to tell yet, it's way too early still. Blood tests do give you a result faster than urine tests though. They can detect a pregnancy earlier than a urine test at about 7-12 days from possible conception ( but if a negative result is received, a test should be repeated if a period is missed.) You might just want to wait it out though and see if you miss your period or not, then test. Good luck.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	i doubt they can tell after just a couple of days.  I'd just wait it out like everybody else and take a home pregnancy test.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No you'll have to wait at least a week for a blood test, longer for a home test<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	i say wait till u miss ur period and get a home pregnancy test
OQnRP6xVaa	I guess, you could check into the Cabbage Patch dolls as they generally come with their own name and paperwork that can be filed with the company to make an adoption final...  Which appears to be the same idea you are interested in.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you think about this if the gift is for an adopted child as our little girl finds the Cabbage Patch doll thing to be offensive and decided she would keep her dolls name as Gertrude and wait to finalize until she knew their mother didn't have any other babies left in the field waiting to be with their sister....|`|kBp9IzQqaa	My adoption papers have rainbows all over them.

I was so sad, and had a lot of guilt. the only way i got over it, was to get pregnant again. so here i am :) but i'm married & we both wanted the baby, so every situation is so different. seek counseling, and talk to your partner. the loss of a pregnancy is very painful at any stage. good luck to you...|`|ex3hiNy8aa	Hey Girl...LISTEN!....EVERYTHING IS BY DESIGN!  Finish school first.  Get your life in order financially.  Being stressed does not help and could bring on another miscarriage so why even try to get pregnant right now?  <br>  <br>  As far as your emotional stress....have you talked to a Dr. or a therapist?  You have a tender heart which is a very beautiful asset.  Reach out and talk to others who have had similar experiences.  Good Luck!

6YnwXCIaaa	The names sound cute overall, but I don't they go together well.  Aimee is very feminine, whereas Skyler is more of a unisex name.  I would pick something more distinctively masculine.|`|uS07WAwcaa	OMG YES!<br>  thats such a cute couple name!!!|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Skyler and Steffie is cute also!|`|35JIECGRaa	Adorable ... both names are somewhat uncommon (Aimee isn't, but the spelling is), and they names together seem to flow ... Skyler and Aimee!<br>  <br>  Love it! :)|`|nZVmkZSBaa	My sister's name is Skylar.. I love both. =]<br>  And yes, they sound good together. I prefer the spelling Amy, though. -x-|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Yeah it's ok. I know a Aimee and Jake who are a couple. I think Aimee and Jake sounds cuter.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|SzDfQjvIaa	Yes!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Here are couple names!!!!!<br>  <br>  Saimme *same-ie*<br>  <br>  Ailar *I-ler*|`|v6YcSPVjaa	Ehh. Skylar is a bad name for a guy all around and I think of a girl whenever I here it, so no. I know a girl named Skylar, so that's probably why, but my aunt is named Aimee and she married a guy named Keith. I think that's a perfect name couple, there is a radio show called "Aimee and Keith" lol. Random little tidbit. Lol.|`|YgzpSbxdaa	Well I thought Skyler was a girl when I first read the question, so probably not.|`|f2osf2iNaa	O M G sounds lyke da OC!<br>  <br>  But seriously.

LDYAGJCxaa	I would talk to your doctor.  I had this problem after our last baby and it turned out to be a hormonal imbalance.  Also, being on the birth control pill can lower your sex drive as well.  Definitely speak with your doctor, he may have some better solutions for you.|`|sAbah6dTaa	idk, my sex drive was gone after i had my daughter, you just have to let him seduce you i guess. =)<br>  <br>  it's just one of those things. =)
pp9RzHvDaa	Please ignore Andie and Jenny's ignorance.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm 20 and was engaged.  We didn't work out and broke up when I was about 9 weeks pregnant.  I was a very serious nursing student and had to quit going to school.  I'm going to pick school back up when I can, but for now,  my baby is my priority.  It really is a blessing in disguise beacuse I am so much more determined to succeed in life because I know that I have someone who is depending on me.  Trust me, you don't need a boyfriend.  All you need is God, your family, and your little one inside you.  I'm 22 weeks on Tuesday so if you wanna talk, e-mail me!|`|RGn4ry2zaa	When my first was born I was 17, my boyfriend said he'd help out, he barely did anything at all. With the same selfishness I was pregnant again and gave birth at 19, with his same attitude he walked out on me.<br>  <br>  That was almost 2 years ago. I stayed in school and tried part-time babysitting where the parents brought the kids over. It might sound like more stress, but they kids had playmates and some kids who were older were able to tell me what they might like. I bought a whole mess of baby books and tried to look at everything positively. Like at least now I have that jerk off my back, I don't have to worry about them being 13 and embarrassed to say their mum is 50.<br>  <br>  I quit baby sitting and started paying time with them while I studied with a bit of financial assistance from my family. I got know how my kids are, how they think and putting myself in their shoes. Now I feel I'm doing great as a college mum.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Good for you! Stand your ground girl. If he wants to be a Jerk then so be it. He's the one who will be missing out on something very  special. Besides he should have thought and used protection if he wasn't ready to be a father. Stay strong and don't give up. Good luck. If he comes back kick his *** to the curb, remember he walked out when you needed him the most.|`|xzMkUCizaa	Well honestly I say you wait a little until after your child is born. Once the baby is born he might change his mind. Its normal that he is scared and unready and obviously it is not right on him to walk out on you right now but remember women mature much sooner than men (for the most part) and it's harder for guys to come to terms of the pregnancy because they do not feel it (body wise) Most guys do not know how to act with your "baby/belly" during pregnancy but turn out to be the greatest fathers once the baby arrives. I know from experience. My (now) fiance had back surgery and I was alone working mornings and going to school at night dealing with a high risk pregnancy at 19 and seeing my dr's every week. It was hard for him to really understand but once he saw the baby he cried and was even more excited than I was (maybe i was just too drugged up lol) But seriously it's hard to have a relationship after this and you don't need to worry about him now but of you and your child. If he wants to leave that's on him. Sooner or later he will come to terms. Once you give birth he might change. Be happy with your pregnancy, put all your problems to the side. yes its hard but honestly why ruin such a wonderful time with your baby. Instead of thinking about him and all your other problems just get yourself a baby book and start tracking your stomach, baby movements, etc. I did this to get my mind off all the stress I was having and I am so happy I did because if they ask me now I do not remember :D Take pictures of your belly week by week so you can show your baby once it arrives. Just let life lead you into the right path. Whatever is meant to happen will happen.I'm glad to hear you are going to continue your education. It's the best thing you can do. I finished school on October and had my baby in December. I was in bed rest from October to the time I was induced in December.I did not make it to the graduation ceremony with all my friends but I got to join the next ceremony which was in march and my son had a first row seat. My instructor made a mini diploma for my son because according to her he never missed a class either :D<br>  I wish you the best and even if he decides not to be a part of your life it does not matter because your child will always have you. I was alone pretty much my child's first year but anytime I looked at my son I somehow got courage to face anything with a smile in my face.<br>  I wish you the best of luck and hopefully everything turns out fine for you and your baby but i have a good feeling it will.<br>  <br>  **The website below is a blog of a single mother, I thought you might enjoy it as much as I do.**|`|43e3633374534ce3ac78d2de7767bcd4aa	Hey I was 16 when I had my daughter and still in high school.  I graduated a year early at 17 and went on to community college and finished there at 19.  Im 21 now and will be graduating this may from UT dallas. I just recently got married too this Jan. and i am expecting my second baby later this year.  My husband loves my daughter and she loves him.  Things are definitely better now than i had dreamed they would be back when i got preggo with her but things have turned out so much better.  I will most def say it has not been easy but it is possible. u just need to take a step back and think of how you are goin to do this.  One step and one day at a time.  Dont listen to that butt hole that called you a whore, she can go to hell.|`|AA10541783	i was with my boys dad until about 3 weeks before i had my youngest, who just turned 4 in january. my oldest was 2 when we moved away because he didn't want to handle his responsibilities. i have been alone with them ever since and they're 4 & 6. it is not easy, but you can do anything you set your mind to. knowing that your children need you at your best doing what needs to be done is great motivation. i got overwhelmed at one point, i lost my boys for 9 months because of drugs. but i've been clean 27 months now, and i'm glad i am so that i can raise my boys the right way. it sounds mean, but i am glad that he is gone now instead of later, it was hell for my oldest the first few years not understanding why he hasn't seen or heard from his daddy. my youngest hasn't seen him since he was 10 months old so i don't worry about him as much. it's not all bad...............life is what you make it! go for the education, work, have some time to yourself when you get the chance, you will need the "time out" too, lol..........most of all good luck in whatever you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0w8EmVjTaa	Stick with your education. I'm 18 in two days and I have a 7 month old. I go to University of Phoenix online. Its really convenient. Anyway you won't get this from many people but congrats and good luck. It will be all worth it when you see your child.|`|QSodlfMraa	my mother is a single mother of 3 if she can do it any one can, do not make this jerk make you lose sight of your goal, make his as$ pay child support. and do not consider this loser again in your life.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Andie- This has NOTHING to do with abortion.

AA11142675	Yup, i've experienced that...still do sometimes...i realised that sometimes it could be because we're annoyed about something but can't seem to see it at the time...u just get angry and u donno whatcha gonna do....like an eruption....<br>  <br>  u need to de-stress...maybe do some exercise, like walking in the park or just looking out at greenery to calm your thoughts...maybe go on a holiday? talking to someone about it is good coz u get to relax a little but as long as u don't figure out what's bugging u, u'll still erupt....<br>  <br>  sometimes it is the ppl that u get angry with...they may hv done sumthin in the past that u haven't quite gotten over...so whenever they say something, u blow...best thing to do is to sit back and think..change ur perception about them...it may help...learn to forgive and forget (this is normally the tough part)...recall what is it about them that u may not be happy with...<br>  <br>  so, while ur figuring out that part, u still need to deal with the issue at hand...when u get angry, u just feel like screaming not taking into account about what the other is feeling...there will be a split moment when u decide what it is ur gonna do...scream or shut up...u gotta be really sharp at this point...talk to urself constantly as a reminder...don't erupt! if ur feeling irritated, just say it...tell the person (calmly) that u need to be excused...ur not feeling urself...not in a good mood...ya know things like that...normally ppl understand when ur honest...then, just make ur way out of there... <br>  <br>  a good nap helps too...maybe a movie? do something fun to remind urself that life cud b more colorful...try a new recipe...pick up an instrument...try listening more instead of talking...<br>  <br>  here's my experience...i donno y but i get irritated and angry when my parents bought me stuff 4 my bday...it really spoils my mood...so wat i did last yr was i bought gifts 4 evry1 else on my bday instead...it did make me feel better, really...it's also nice to use that energy to think of wat others wud like and get it for them ya know...<br>  <br>  so, good luck in figuring it out...hope i helped a little...|`|jLI0IgWkaa	here's a tried and proven true method. (It works when I do it on my friend) <br>  On a calm day, have a heart to heart discussion with your friends, and tell them how you're trying to break your habit of tantruming over "nothing" and ask for their help. The next time you start a tantrum, they will just say " __________ (call you by your name) calm down, I (we) know you're upset, but it's really trivialities, calm down"<br>  and they should repeat this line to you over and over again until you really calm down.|`|NYJgiVxraa	sign urself up for an anger management class and explain to your parents if you can what your deal is and why you want to change. hopefully they understand, if not speak to a social worker. if ur 16 +, u can get urself in teen health center urself.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	All you can really do is apologize for what you have done. Just give your friends a little more time to forgive you, if they truly are your friend they will. Sounds like you could have depression or anxiety issues, maybe you should go to the doctors and let them know how you have been feeling. Maybe they will prescribe you something or maybe they could send to get some counseling. Sounds as if you have been holding things in about whats going on in your life. Even if you don't see a therapist, you should talk to a good friend or your parents and let her know what is going on with you and maybe you be able to come up with something that makes you feel better and less angry. Try not to worry so much and do something that makes you feel better like getting you nails done or buy new outfit, whatever you like. Try it, it may help.

2zC1lpfVaa	Usually for my first half of the cycle, my temperature is around 36.4 C.  For the 2nd half (after ovulation) it is around 36.8 C... So the difference is in around 0.4 C.<br>  <br>  For converting the temperature, you can try to use those online temperature convertors from the web.|`|4akKbI23aa	Working in Farenheit (yes America is still stuck on that) its only like a couple degrees or less.
MjtmHraHaa	After stopping the pill, it seems to take a little bit for all those hormones to get out of your system and to allow everything to start functioning normally.  At least give it a month and chart out your cycle.  Charts can be found online or from your doctor.  Take you basil temp every morning at the same time, document the readings on the chart, document when you're having sex and the days of your period.  That way it's a lot easier to determine when ovulation is (there's a pretty small window!) and when you're more likely to get pregnant.  :)|`|LeX9Z7jjaa	I wasn't trying to have a baby at the time that I got pregnant, but I wasn't doing much to stop it from happening (pull out method doesn't work at all!!) and I stopped taking birth control after being on it for 5 years in October 2006 and I found out I was pregnant October 2007.

oem5yEUDaa	Of course you can take a bath!  Your friends are absolutely wrong, it is a myth that you can't. The only time you shouldn't is if your water has broken.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	it is not recommended to take or sit in a hot bath while pregnant; you can raise your core temp and cause stress to the baby; if you take one, not too hot and not too long...sorry, you got a short while longer and you can do what you want...|`|pXSKSS3daa	You can take a bath but I wouldn't allow it to get TOO hot. If your skin turns pink then you need to cool it down a bit.|`|OWReYgV5aa	I have taken hot baths every night all the way through both my pregnancies...well, I'm currently in my 2nd one.  But what I did at first, was I took a meat thermometer...and placed it in the tub with me and made sure it didn't get over the recommended degree, which is, I think 100 degrees, which was plenty hot for me.  Just make sure you don't cover up to your neck and stay in steaming hot water.  I think the hype on hot baths is way overdone.....|`|u94HOVz7aa	at that point in my pregnancy a hot bath was what my ob recommended to help relieve my braxton hicks and pack pain.  i would lay in there till the water went cold.  it was wonderful!|`|wURg3jBcaa	Just don't get too overheated and you'll be okay.|`|46ijdaH6aa	It's okay as long as the water is close to your own body temperature, under 100 degrees. If the water is too hot, you get overheated and that increases your heart rate, reduces blood flow to the fetus, and potentially puts the baby under stress.  <br>  <br>  as long as the water temperature isn't over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have to ease your foot into the tub, it's too hot. If you're comfortable getting into the water, the temperature is close to your own body temperature, which is where you want it. Anything hotter can damage your baby's developing cells, and though you can cool off by sweating, your baby can't. It's also fine to use bath oils or bubble bath — your cervix is closed, so there's no danger of these products reaching your baby.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	I read in a book by Jenny Mccarthy that it was alright if you take a hot bath, but if you start to feel too hot you need to get out. I actually had no idea about this rule until I read it. I went into a hot tub before i read the belly laughs book. But everything was fine.I took baths throughout my entire pregnancy it felt good to relax in something warm. Congrats on the new baby!|`|CIBtfxEqaa	Take a warm bath, relax, and don't worry about anything. Light a couple of soothing candles and enjoy the time yuou have left being pregnant!

DDYwnut6aa	No.  You'd be pregnant.  The other egg would simply die.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	No, because if one egg was fertilized you would be pregnant.  I don't think you would have a period.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	More than likely, your body would just absorb the extra egg.  Your period occurs when a fertilized egg does not implant into your uterus.  The blood you get is from your uterus shedding your uterine lining.  If a fertilized egg has implanted then your uterus begins preparing itself for the baby rather than shedding it's lining.|`|dSuu7CMZaa	No, you wouldn't have a period.  You may have implantation spotting, but not a true "period".  The 2nd egg that didn't get fertilized would disinigrate and pass through your body.

It is a must read if you are ttc!|`|ztzEloj5aa	everyone seems to think you cant get your period when pregnant<br>  they also say you can only give one egg during a cycle<br>  they are wrong- you can if you have a bicornuate uterus -its where the uterus is divided. - one side will not relate to the other side- you can be pregnant on one side and ovulate on the other. and get a period you can also have twins this way that were conceived weeks apart-|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	no you would not have a period, you would be pregnant|`|ncKz0nqRaa	No, because the placenta would start to form in order to support the pregnancy.
a7pgX1W8aa	First I would like to extend my sympathies for your loss. I don't think you have anything to worry about. It is normal. I had a miscarriage at 9 weeks gestation, about 2 years ago and I had only light spotting right after the procedure and then nothing after that, the baby was so small that it didn't affect you body as much. I also had bad cramping. All this is normal. Your doctor should have prescribed you some pain meds like Tylenol 3 for the pain. If he didn't you should call for some. It does help. Give your self time to heal. Take care of yourself. Every woman's body is different and you not bleeding should not be a concern. Hope this helps.|`|IA1irLy7aa	i would go back to the doctor and get checked personally instead of over the phone this happened to me and it turned out they didn't remove any of the miscarriage embryo so i had to go back and get it done again. after the second time i had heaps of bleeding and heaps of cramping. but i have heard of woman not bleeding and it all was removed.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I don't remember having any bleeding after my D&C...

0OTV0a4Zaa	yes you could be pregnant, the morning after pill stops you from ovulating, if you were already ovulating while you had sex then the sperm could have feratlized your egg, and seeing it took you a few days before you took the pill you could have ovulated on any of those days and the sperm would have still been alive in the uterus and could have feratlized the egg.sperm can survive in the uterus for up to 5 days. the pill doesnt stop a pregnancy it just stops ovulation so if you ovulated before you took the pill, the pill wouldnt have worked. it is also very hard to determine when you have ovulated,some people even ovulate twice a month and you can ovulate while you have your period. the chances of you being pregnant are high. it is possible to be having symtoms this early as well, you could go to the doctors and have a blood test done and that will tell you accuretly if your pregnant or not.<br>  if your not and you dont want kids use protection.|`|AA10015577	It takes a little longer than that to experience symptoms, just wait and see if you miss your period.  Good luck!|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	wait until your period now is to early to tell|`|LXMbUx2Jaa	no|`|1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	You'd be better off talking to a healthcare professional or reading some information from reliable sources than asking here! <br>  <br>  First of all, if it's only 8 days, you might have conceived but you probably haven't implanted yet. Even if you have, you won't be able to tell. <br>  <br>  The Plan B pill works in a few ways. It either prevents ovulation, or if ovulation already occurred, prevents fertilization. If fertilization already occurred, it prevents the conceptus from implanting in the uterus.

LBfD7tbHaa	Early as 36 weeks if the mother having complication...|`|4TNavgDuaa	I had a friend who had a c-section at 38 weeks. The baby was 6 pounds even so she was fine and got to go home after 3 days in the hospital. I guess it all depends and the weight and how well that baby is doing.|`|lzUF22l0aa	i really dont understand what your asking ... if the baby is a premmie then the take it to the nicu and try to keep the baby thriving. If it makes it to 8 months they send it home with the mother.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Fetal age has nothing to do with it.  If for some reason that baby HAS  to be born early, they'll do a c-section if medically necessary.  If the woman is already in labor too early, they'll stop it if they can, again, unless it's medically necessary that the baby be born so soon.  But they wouldn't do a c-section in that case, unless the baby was in distress.<br>  <br>  Babies born too early stay in the newborn ICU until they're big enough and healthy enough to go home.  I know a lady who was in a terrible car wreck at 6 months pregnant, and they had to get that baby OUT to save both of them, but they did, and everyone recovered.  The baby is progressing nicely and is expected to eventually be completely healthy.  His mother had twins about 18 months later!|`|gWiZAsfBaa	There is no age requirements for babies when a c-section is being performed. C-sections are done if the mother is having complications or if the baby is having complications. Even then doctors try to wait until the baby is around 8 months to perform the C-section. My mom had a c-section with my youngest brother. She was 9 months pregnant, they did a c-section because my brother had a large growth on his lower back. My cousin's wife had a c-section when she was 8 months pregnant because her daughter's stomach wasn't fully closed.<br>  <br>  If the baby is born premature, it will remain in the hospital until the doctor says it's okay to bring it home.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I'm not sure I understand your question, but I will try to answer as I thought.<br>  <br>  1. It really depends on the situation and the doctor. An elective c-section would generally be done around 38 weeks.<br>  <br>  2. They usually evaluate the baby and do whats necessary. At worst some NICU time if the baby had to come underdeveloped.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	they wont do a c-section unless the woman is at least 37 weeks along. if it is an emergency then the baby will go into a neonatal intensive care unit.|`|WF8J4Yczaa	I think this has been answered on another closed question - but I will check.|`|kcq1QW6Daa	, I feel for you - that is a tough question|`|51UePKGsaa	A UNBORN BABY WILL HAVE 2WEEKS TO BE WHEN IT COMS 1-2 WEEKS IT HAD BEEN REMOVED

5f6XnInEaa	It depends on what your doctor has to say, and to what degree this is.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think that is a viable reason for risking an induction at all, and a lot of doctors would side with me.<br>  <br>  With inductions come risks, and any decent doctor would not risk one, if it was not needed, as inductions end in c-sections almost half of the time.<br>  Any good doctor tries to avoid emergency surgery!<br>  <br>  Usually, an induction is only done if the babies health is at stake, or the mother is having trouble with the pregnancy, or has severe conditions, such as preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes.<br>  <br>  You have to understand that this is a part of the third trimester.<br>  Almost all, if not all, women have the same pain you are having, so you are not alone.<br>  <br>  The point is, if no ones health is at risk, the chances of your doctor inducing early are minimal (Unless your doctor is impatient, and is one of the ones that induce early for no real reason)<br>  <br>  And your weight has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  My son was born naturally at 38 weeks with the lung maturity of a 35 week old.<br>  Please don't assume that once you hit 37 weeks, it is ok for your baby to be out.<br>  Just because the book says full term, it is no indication of how your baby is doing in there.<br>  <br>  In my case, it wasn't, and it is not worth risking that, when you could just wait a few extra weeks.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	No woman feels great the last month or so of pregnancy. But induction can lead to a hard labor your body is not ready for and complications that will make you wish for the pain you have these days (c-sections/major abdominal surgery will also make it hard for you to walk, to lay down, to get out of bed.) Not to mention how awful it would be to have to watch your baby in the NICU b/c you weren't comfortable yourself being pregnant. I have a friend who had an amnio at 38 wks and they said her baby's lungs weren't ready. I could never live with myself for forcing my body and baby to go down that path.|`|lzUF22l0aa	it really depends on your doctor does loose hope but my doctor sucks i am in pain all day everyday and my back kills and now the babys movements actually hurt me alot also. So i would talk to your obgyn and see what they say all doctors are diffrent. Good luck hope you have better luck than i do.|`|LALfPKmSaa	They'll probably want to do an ultrasound to make sure the baby is at a healthy weight and size. Then you might get lucky if the doc is nice and they'll induce at over 37.<br>  Good luck.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	u will have to ask ur doctor, but if it is tat bad i cant see y they wouldnt|`|QUA9EaZQaa	You only have 3 weeks to go.  Tell your doctor how much pain you are in and they may consider inducing.  But they would probably want to make sure the baby's lungs are mature.  If not you just might have to stay on bed rest.  If thats what you need to do to keep your baby healthy, you might want to stock up on magazines and such so you don't have to move around much.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	That really depends on your doctor. Unless there is another reason for the baby to need to come out early, I doubt it. I had a friend who had terrible kidney stones that required surgery, she was hospitalized for over a month, and they didn't even induce her until 40 weeks. So, I doubt they would, but you never know! Ask them about it!<br>  <br>  Also, have you considered going to get a massage or see a chiropractor? Those are the only things that help me deal with that kind of pain. It may not completely take it away but it makes it more tolerable.
zwctZ812aa	No, you do not have to be married.  You can give the baby any last name you want.  You could make one up if you wanted to.  Your baby's hospital bracelets will have to have your last name on them because they need to correspond with yours to prevent mix ups, but when you fill out the birth certificate paperwork you can put any name on it you want.  If you want to put the father's name on the birth certificate, he will have to sign a declaration of paternity stating that he doesn't contest he is the father.  The hospital will know how to do all this and walk you through it.  If he wants a paternity test, you will have to wait to put his name on the birth certificate, but u can still give the baby his name.|`|k8sukeTbaa	No, you can give the baby his last name.  I'd highly suggest you get married though, for your baby's mental health (it's really hard growing up with un-married parents, coming from my history).  That way, when you get married, you won't have to legally change his/her last name to fit the family.  So just give him/her your boyfriend's last name to save the stress.  Good luck.|`|JGpirCtLaa	Your baby can have whatever last name you want it to. Doesn't even have to be yours or your boyfriends. You could totally make something up.<br>  For example, my grandpa's last name is Barnett, his brother's last name is Barnette. Nobody has ever told me how this happened, but my dad, brothers & sisters are all Barnett...my cousins are all Barnette.<br>  <br>  One of my sister's friends, her last name is Curtis. Her mom & dad's last name is Guisinger...Her grandpa's FIRST name is Curtis, and they wanted her last name to be his first name.<br>  <br>  I have no idea how people come up with these things, but yeah you can name the baby whatever you want!<br>  <br>  My mom had me at 17 and my dad was 22 and I have my dad's last name. (They have never been married and are not together)|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	your baby can his name or your name <br>  it doesn't matter if you're married.<br>  if he's the father the baby can have his name|`|c51ed3fd68dbbc18322e2b41a772c974aa	it depends which country you are in, the laws differ from place to place.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	It is entirely up to you. You do not have to be married to give your child his last name. <br>  <br>  One word of advise would be don't get married just because you "might" be pregnant. Make sure that "if" you get married to this man that it is for all of the right reasons. I am not trying to be rude or mean. So please do not take it that way.|`|v6YcSPVjaa	You can put any name you want on the birth certificate. You can use his last name or your last name. But choose wisely. You may not be together forever and you really don't know if he would truly be committed to being in the child's life. You wouldn't want your child to carry a burden that you put upon them at birth for the rest of their life. Good luck though and I hope all goes well!|`|tjLbXhtEaa	yes your baby can have his last name married or not, as long as he is listed on the birth certificate. <br>  and the baby's name on the certificate with his last name. <br>  there really is no legalese involved just the birth certificate is enough.|`|MikhcVZfaa	Yes, of course your baby can have his last name. That's the way it's supposed to be, regardless if you guys are married or not.|`|5633e8191b884e0bdc24b085089f5122aa	It all depends on your state requirements.

And no don't "wait and hope" like someone suggested!<br>  Plan B (or the morning after pill as it is commonly called) is available at Planned Parenthood offices and is fairly inexpensive.  It is for these types of situations and is the equivalent of taking a large dose of birth control pills.

wEEOvu5Waa	First, ignore all the harassment you'll get on here from users. Instead of just -answering- a question, they like to throw at you how "horrid and sick" you are for asking it. Another thing, let no one sway your own choice. They might not believe in it, but it sure doesn't mean they have any right to try and stop you or judge you for your decision.<br>  <br>  First, look up clinics in your state. Each state will have different laws about abortions. For example, Florida goes up to 24 weeks, but some will only go to 13 weeks. In some states it is illegal, and in some you have to have a doctor sign a waiver saying that you giving birth could endanger your life, so you need an abortion.<br>  <br>  And then costs. First, how far along are you? There is a pill method that allows you to eject the fetus if you are under 9 weeks. If not, the farther along you are the harder the procedure is on you, and the more morally wrong it could be. The longer you wait the more the fetus turns into a baby.<br>  <br>  Anything from 12 weeks and up has to be done surgically. I wont go into the details on that one because it is pretty gruesome. But every clinic is a tad different, so always check everything out on their website if they have one.<br>  <br>  Abortions can sometimes be covered under insurance plans, and if not, abortions are usually $350 and up. They are not cheap.<br>  <br>  Since you are in High School I strongly suggest telling your parents, or at least your mom. You WILL need her help on this. I know it can be scary, heck I was afraid to tell my mom at 18! But in the long run it will really help you out. Just take a deep breathe and let it out. Trust me when I say you cannot do this alone. Between getting a ride/money...you will need her.<br>  <br>  And always remember that there are other options, like adoption. I will admit (and I also expect tons of thumbs down for being such an evil lady!) that I was in your boat 20 weeks ago. I was pregnant and scared, and more than struggling. We decided to go the abortion route...but I didn't tell my mom. I thought I could do it on my own. Well, I couldn't. By the time I hit 20 weeks I was desperate, and I knew I couldn't abort now...because I WAS carrying a baby then, and not just a fetus. It's true im glad that I didn't abort, and I am doing the adoption route. But if I had just told my mom sooner, things might have been different. Even if I chose not to abort way back when, my mom felt more hurt than mad for not telling her. And her sadness was worse than her anger.<br>  <br>  This is a big decision for you right now, abortion or adoption. Or even keeping. And the one thing I cannot stress the most is: TELL YOUR MOM!<br>  <br>  Also, I really hope the people who just keep saying "Go for adoption! Its free!" have actually had to carry their child for nine months. Because regardless of if the baby goes to a good family, adoption is almost harder than abortion. Because, ive seen my little girl. I saw her wave to me, and I felt her kick. She wakes me up every morning, and every time her daddy sees me he kisses my belly. We read to her, and we sing to her. And every night we go to bed crying because we know that in 5 more months we will never see her again. See her first step, hear her first words. The word "adoption" shouldn't be thrown around so easily. Because it's easier to type it, then it is to actually do it. And yes, we did use condoms and I was on the pill.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I don't agree with abortion at all. I think its a cruel fate for any baby, no baby deserves that.  Please consider adoption.

You are not ready to raise a baby. Or you could just let it go for adoption. Anyway, do your parents know?<br>  <br>  Abortion is not murder-and is not wrong at all. People really need to stop putting their opinions into this matter. There are so many parent less children out there because people weren't careful.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with saving the child from a hard life.

Going to a clinic is safer and more effective than attempting self-induced abortion. For funding information in the USA: www.nnaf.org/help.html<br>  <br>  If you are underage in the United States and are looking at self-induced abortion because of fear of parental notification – there are organizations set up to assist you. Contact your local National Organization of Women chapter www.now.org or your local Unitarian Church minister www.uua.org and ask about Operation Overground - a service to help transport and provide accomodation for women who must travel across states to obtain clinical abortion services. When you travel to another state without parental notification laws - you do not need to obtain permission or notification.<br>  <br>  If you are still looking at self-induced abortion, the best information is available in a book called Natural Liberty: Rediscovering Self-Induced Abortion Methods by Sage-femme Collective. ISBN 9780964592001 available at Amazon.com. This book details self-induced abortion methods, dosages and potential risks of medical abortion, menstrual extraction, herbal abortion, massage, etc. Free excerpts from the book are available at their website: www.sagefemmetoday.com and they have some information in FAQs regarding cautions regarding online ordering of medical abortion pharmaceuticals.<br>  <br>  Also, detailed how-to information on medical abortion - the safest and most effective method of self-induced abortion is available at www.womenonwaves.org<br>  However, Womenonwaves and Womenonweb's service is for areas where abortion is illegal - so they will not ship medical abortion pharmaceuticals to the United States.<br>  There are several websites that offer the medical abortion pharmaceuticals online for sale, however many of them are suspect or proven to take your money, but not send the pills or send pills that do not contain the medical abortion medicines mifepristone and misoprostol. <br>  <br>  For a list of bogus scam medical abortion sites and studies of online companies:<br>  <a href="http://www.womenonwaves.org/article-445-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.womenonwaves.org/article-445-...</a><br>  <br>  Misoprostol is reputed to be easier to obtain, and still has a high rate of effectiveness (approximately 80% effective when used alone).<br>  <br>  Women on Waves advice regarding how to obtain misoprostol:<br>  "The brand names for Misoprostol are Cytotec and Arthrotec and Oxaprost or Cyprostol , Prostokos or Misotrol. Sometimes it is sold over the counter without a prescription. Sometimes a prescription is asked. It is less likely that one would need a prescription for Arthrotec.<br>  <br>  Misoprostol is used prevents gastric ulcers<br>  '''Cytotec and Cyprostol and Mibetec or Misotrol', Prostokos'' are brand names for Misoprostol.<br>  Arthrotec and Oxaprost contains Misoprostol and a painkiller called Diclofenac, It is used for pain in the joints, or arthritis. Arthrotec is generally more expensive than Cytotec.<br>  <br>  - Cytotec (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Cyprostol<br>  - Misotrol<br>  - Mibetec<br>  - Gymiso (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Prostokos (25μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Vagiprost (25μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Arthrotec 50 or 75 (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Oxaprost 50 or 75 (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  <br>  To obtain one these medicines, one could for example say that your grandmother has rheumatoid arthritis so severely she can not go to the pharmacy herself, and that you do not have money to pay for a doctor to get the prescriptions for the tablets.<br>  <br>  If there are problems to get the medicines in one pharmacy, try another pharmacy, or a male friend or partner might have fewer problems obtaining them. Or, perhaps you can find a doctor willing to prescribe them. Usually one can expect more luck at the smaller pharmacies that do not belong to a chain.<br>  <br>  Sometimes Cytotec can also be bought on the black market (places where you can also buy Marijuana). However try to make sure that is really is Misoprostol and not fake or some other medicine!<br>  <br>  The woman should buy at least 12 pills of 200 mcg Misoprostol. One pill of Cytotec or Arthrotec should contain 200 micrograms of Misoprostol. Look for the dosage of Misoprostol on the package, usually the tablets contain 200 mcg but other dosages do excist. If the pills do not contain 200 micrograms of Misoprostol, recalculate the number of pills so that the same total amount of Misoprostol is used.

My son was EXTREMELY colicky and we tried Born Free, Dr. Browns, Nuk and the Playtex VentiAir and the only thing that he would even put in his mouth was Avent.  They seemed to be great for him and worked the best, but every baby has there own opinion ;)|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	As the other answers have said playtex drop ins work great!I use themfor my son! They get the air out and are so convenient!|`|Efa5EYJJaa	I use Vent Aire and it is helping. I got nipples that are for babies who are also nursing.|`|46ijdaH6aa	I would also recommend the drop ins .. You can get all the air out which will reduce colic.|`|u94HOVz7aa	playtex with the liners are a good alternatve to the dr. browns.  or the playtex ventair.  i would guess any of them that have the vents would work, but i use the dr. browns so i am unsure.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit*  just thought i would add have you tried the wide mouth dr. browns?  they make those also if the skinny nipple is the problem.|`|xV3e72e1aa	I like the Playtex drop-ins.  You can push out all of the air, allowing less air to get in your baby's tummy.
1o3OqSioaa	Yes, it is definitely abuse, both by the 6 yr. old and by the parent allowing it. It is teaching the older one to use violence to right a situation, when talking or a time- out should have been used, if needed. It is teaching the 4 yr. old to use violence, as well, when someone hurts him again. <br>  Since they are your cousins, talk to your parents about it, and let them talk to the adults that are their sister or brother. That's the most that you can do, unless you are the adult. You can also try talking to your cousins, and tell them that is not the right way to handle things. Somebody has to talk to them, especially the 6 yr. old. Just talk to him in a way that a 6 yr. old can understand, using kindness. It sounds as if they are not getting enough of that these days.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Lizzie|`|galoGEOFaa	Actually I think it may fall under neglect, at the very least negligence. <br>  <br>  The parents responsibility is to protect the children, BOTH of them, and that may mean protecting them from each other. it certainly means not encouraging them to hurt each other.<br>  <br>  These children are not being protected.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No it is not fair to do that nor is it right.|`|AA10462002	wtf??? I'm sorry, but some people just don't deserve to be parents....  I would imagine this would be considered abuse.  I mean, she allowed her son to hit her other son.  Even "that once" would have been wrong, but she allowed it multiple times, and even told him to do so and encouraged him.  Yes, kids get out of control and do inappropriate things, but a responsible parent would have been outside supervising and put an end to it as soon as it started.  Wrestling over a stick (not just hitting with it) is extremely dangerous in itself.  When the 4 year old accidentally poked his brother, what if it had poked him in the eye???  Sticks are sharp!!!  <br>  <br>  So basically:<br>  1) There was no proper supervision to start with.<br>  2) Even when informed of the situation she not only allowed it to continue, but actually encouraged it.<br>  <br>  To me that is physical abuse, just she had the brother do it instead of her.  She allowed her son to get physically abused by his brother and she just stood there watching.<br>  <br>  I would def. either call the police or maybe even CPS if this happens routinely.  Yeah, it's not fair to the children if they have to be taken away from the family, but neither is it fair for them to grow up in the environment that this mother is allowing.  It's a judgment call, but if you really feel that there in a hostile environment day in day out because of this unfit mother, a phone call should be placed.  It can be done anonymously so don't  be afraid of any repercussions against you.  Maybe even videotape these things happening (can be done discreetly on a cell phone) so you have proof if needed.<br>  <br>  However, if this is a 1 time thing, and not an ongoing issue, as much as I disagree with how she treated her own son, idk if I would go as far as calling cps or anything, but I would def. point it out to her and try to offer alternatives so this doesn't continue.  In other words try to help her, instead of unnecessarily breaking up the family over one offense.  Either way she needs help though.  If you feel she won't take you seriously enough, maybe have your parents talk to her.  Or her husband, nobody mentioned the father, where is he????   <br>  <br>  I really feel bad for both kids, cuz they're going to grow up to be the school bully everyone hates, unless they learn now what is considered "play wrestling" and what's considered violence.|`|3X8Igzhxaa	it is bad parenting and abuse i would ring the docs and report them those kids aren't growing up with any right moral guideline and god knows what kind of parents they will make themselves if no one helps them now oh and Christan's no way maybe proclaimed Christan's there more of those out there than real ones|`|eHrc9NPcaa	wow that is really mean <br>  i mean its not really abuse but thats freakin dumb i hate when i see parents do that i just want to slap them<br>  there just kids|`|3ccfce4389827491224d42fa4a33d8dcaa	Yes, that's abuse. And it's the reason some people should not breed.|`|vFZq7522aa	I think that is it a very stupid way to deal with the situation!! But yes I would call that abuse!! they shouldn't have done that!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I'm not sure about it being abuse.. but it's certainly along the lines of it. That's a horrible way of teaching a child right from wrong may I add! That doesn't teach neither of the two kids that it's wrong to hit others, doing that will probably ENCOURAGE them to hit other kids.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	For me that is 100% wrong. You can't teach a kid not to hit by hitting. The little on is 4 and probably doesn't even understand all that happened. Now he has learned hitting is ok as long as it's him being hit on.  I would report it myself. What if the 6 year old had hit him in the face, or caused some major damage to the little guy.
Si9hhcW1aa	I would definitely consult your doctor. It is normal for some mood swings but yours almost seems like there might be another  underlying problem. Talk to your doctor, I am sure that she, or he, will be able to help you more than the answers you can get on here. Good luck, and tell your husband to just wait it out. Hopefully it will only last another 30 weeks.|`|g6sCUoO7aa	I've read that mood swings are completely normal during the first trimester of pregnancy. I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant, and my moods are all over the place, including anger! The littlest things set me off! If you are that concerned about it, go see your doctor :-]|`|dSobv28maa	Hun, any concerns you should bring up with the doctor.  Even something you think is silly|`|pHIbnjuBaa	Explain to me what does "normal" mean? I have never meant two women that have had the same exact experience during their pregnancy. Your hormones are working overtime. If there is something your doctor can do, you will not know until you ask him. Take a walk when you are angry or maybe a bath. Find something you enjoy doing and do it when you feel like this. Kiss your husband and tell him you love him. He is only trying to help. Tell him how you feel and what is the best way for him to help you. A every man needs an I love you just like us girls. Think about it and talk about it.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i woudl call the dr in the mornin gi get pissy but it isnt all the time or bad good luck|`|9Gsx32Skaa	You can call you doctor and see if she or he reccommends seeing a therepist or not. I had mood swings too, though not anger. I was an emotional wreck, everything made me cry and I was very sensitive to peoples tone of voice and thier inability to cope with the emotional pregnant lady in the house. seriously, if you feel like it would do yourself good to tak to somebody, your doc will know many good counselors, therepists and people who need help coping with the emotions that come along with pregnancy.
AOvtRBU9aa	the side effect of domperidone is lactation. Soem people actually take to help milk supply.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	yep, I took domperidone to increase my milk after I started birth control pills again when my son was 6 months old. It's a normal side effect but hey if you wanted to you could pump it and try to re lactate, other wise just use breast pads and it will stop when you stop taking the medication.|`|7kosr9mcaa	YES! Domperidone is often used to increase milk supply in breastfeeding mother but can also be used to resolve stomach issues. I have been on Domperidone for aboyt 3 months now for stomach problems and I have quite a bit of milk leaking.  I did not breastfeed. My son wouldn't latch and after 2 weeks of trying he was losing weight so I put him on formula (I know, it would have been much better to just let him starve!! HA! (SARCASIM))|`|fv8o23zcaa	I was prescribed motilium to increase my breast milk and it worked so this would be why you have started leaking. <br>  while breast milk might be best for baby you have to do what is best for you as well. I breastfed my 1st till 12 months but my 2nd for only 2 weeks, my 1st has eye problems and get sick more, so do what suits you best and don't worry about what others say.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	omg u shouldnt have given up breastfeeding!! lol just jokes dear, im only kidding!    bottle feeding is not bad at all!!!! <br>  <br>  id say the domperidone is the reason why your breasts are leaking but its actually a MAJOR sign of pregnancy too, so id also get checked out for that!.  <br>  <br>  <br>  hi-five ;)|`|YXUmCjJaaa	Yes,  Motilium simulates lactation, so it's probably the cause of your breasts leaking.
a7pgX1W8aa	Laying on your left side keeps all the pressure off you internal parts and with your expanding uterus this is a good thing. If anything the side you lay on should be sore and since it is not, that is good. These are just the normal pains in pregnancy. Just try to get used to it you have a long way to go. What might help is getting a body pillow for you to prop your leg up, this may take some of the pain away and keep your body in better alignment. Hope this helps.|`|KpeyqmWhaa	No<br>  nothing is wrong<br>  when i was pregnant i had the same thing<br>  just sleep on the other side<br>  any way your more comfortable so you can  enjoy your pregnancy|`|7da94e3c936a7afc3d03e6dc12b85b9daa	No worries. Get use to being uncomfortable:)|`|vFZq7522aa	no!! just normal paine of pregnancy!!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	LOL wait until you are 30 weeks!  Your whole body will hurt.......pregnancy is uncomfortable.  Your uterus will stretch especially right now at 9 weeks getting ready for baby to grow so it might make your back, hips, abdomen and chest hurt.  As long as your not cramping or bleeding most pains in pregnancy are just there!  Good Luck.|`|OWReYgV5aa	Don't worry, just enjoy being pregnant.  I had hip pain, chest pain, back pain from early on...and still have it.  Just keep looking for comfortable positions....that's the best advice I can give you..lol.  The sleeping doesn't get much better...you'll have good nights and bad nights...but it's all normal and very worth it...you'll have your sleep again one day.
xRZ1PRZwaa	*Edited<br>  <br>  Hi hon. I'm sorry for your loss. This must be really difficult for you.<br>  <br>  At about 4 weeks gestation, you shouldn't require a D&C. However, there are instances when they recommend it (when all tissue hasn't passed, known as either a missed miscarriage, missed abortion or incomplete miscarriage.<br>  <br>  I'd strongly suggest not having a D&C unless it is absolutely necessary (to avoid infection). I'm not trying to get your hopes up, but I do want you to know that many, many women have been told they've miscarried when in actuality they went on to have healthy, happy babies from that same pregnancy. This happened to me, and I'm thankful like you wouldn't even know that I didn't have a D&C.<br>  <br>  I hope things go well for you sweetie - I'm thinking of you.<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  Hi! I looked up a link I read when I experienced this - it's below for you.|`|6pLLPdPwaa	They are probably doing the test to make sure you don't need a D&C. I have just been through a D&C which turned out to be a ectopic pregnancy.  I had a miscarriage about a year and a half ago in my 4th month. <br>  I am so sorry for your loss. All you can do now is follow your doctors orders and hope for better luck next time. I know how painful it is. <br>  If you do have to have a D&C, don't worry... it's not that bad. It was worse for me emotionally than it was physically. <br>  Take care and get plenty of rest.|`|7xB6HZwiaa	They are making sure..Are u cramping?  U may have to if your body doesn't dispel it.  I had to have one...Its scary and it will hurt a little after.  But U have to have it taken out if your body doesn't do it naturally...It can cause infection.<br>  <br>  Sorry.   Din't give up until u get the results though.
b6EyFLgUaa	I watched this show once with my daughter when PBS was wonky. It freaked me out, its a creepy show and we have never watched it again. Idk if it was the episode or what. I dont know if its brain washing but its creepy.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	It is so weird, but my kid loves it. They do teach things like not to bite and hit and if thats the way they will learn than it's worth it. I think Barney is worse. Kids love silly things that make them laugh and I am not alays going to be that silly for her, so she gets it from the show sometimes|`|rCvwGaNaaa	my 6 month old loves DJ Lance...i think its bc hes in bright orange and talks to her (at the camera). She gets all excited and starts kicking her feet and smiles. at first the show was alright. I liked the episode about faces. But now its starting to just be annoying and weird. So we dont watch it anymore.|`|yO0HFCxvaa	If I had children, I would say yes, solely based on the fact that it draws me in like a moth to a flame. Not to mention I get easily detracted be shinny or loud objects.|`|0ROJQPxmaa	it is kind of my lil cuz always says go gaba gaba alot lol|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	"Keep trying, keep trying, don't give up, never give up..."<br>  <br>  They make songs that refuse to leave your brain...my kids love that show.|`|fUjsE0LRaa	i hate it at the end when they go through all the songs they have sung and turn it into like a re-mix, i hate re-mixes, they drive me batty, but my son likes it, i just try to ignore it when he is watching it, but it's on in the mornings and i watch Sunrise with Kochie and Mel then.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Yes! ~Puts hand up~. It is kinda freaky in my opinion, lol. And I mean the Gabba thingo throwing up over people? Right....<br>  I decided not to let my daughter watch it after watching it myself once. I mean I know it's not that bad, but it's still freaky, lol. Plus it's on when the News is on, so....She didn't watch it that much anyway.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	It creeps me out actually. I change the channel if it's on. My son prefers Dora, Spongbob, wonderpets, or that Kailan show.|`|AA12084593	It brainwashes me! Theres a party in my tummy!!|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	that show freaks me out and I don't let my kids watch it.
IFDfpbFJaa	It looks like someone is taking a picture of someone taking a picture....or its a reflection in a gas station window...I think it's the reflection since the title of the is reflection.<br>  I like it. It's pretty.|`|5tqh0akYaa	someone was taking a picture off the girl.|`|Hb04EISQaa	Actually, it's sortof like a mirror.  This picture was taken by using the reflection of a glass door.  The glass on the door was tinted very dark so the light reflects off of it very well.  Notice the handle of the door running across the picture.  The picture is alright.|`|XbzgPJ9Gaa	Yah.  I think it's cool.  The scenery is pretty.<br>  I like it.<br>  Did you take it in the reflection of a door in like a strip mall?|`|7MKmxkjlaa	someone taking a picture of a little girl taking apicture LOL <br>  and yeah its cool.|`|dB6MR0wYaa	you took it in front of a tinted window|`|xCifmFfkaa	Why do we need to understand it? <br>  <br>  I see a twiggy/child taking a picture of herself in some convenience store door. Big f*cking deal. <br>  <br>  You are quite the arr--teest<br>  <br>  Edit: My mistake it is a Texaco station. I was close enough the first time.|`|jPnhpmhsaa	Photo taking or adjusting.|`|X489OiKjaa	the reflection of a door..|`|eff21d66c171033c319f0d8b3f48518baa	Is it your reflection from a glass door or window?<br>  <br>  That's my only guess.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ~Danny
cIn8BkYHaa	Well my boobs are generally sore. The first sign of pregnancy I actually had was that my nipples were strangely sensitive and erect more then usual. You could be pregnant, or it could be the hormones in the pills. Take a test if you are pregnant it should give you a pretty accurate result by now! Lots of luck!|`|RzYePezkaa	I know pregnancy caused my nipples to be sore with my first baby and second baby so it could be that.Try taking a test to be sure.Good luck and baby dust your way.|`|7geLpG6Oaa	I'd take a pregnancy test for sure. My nips were so sore with my first pregnancy it hurt to have a tshirt on touching them.|`|hmOidFp3aa	My guess is that you are pregnancy! If you OPK came up positive last month then my guess is that your egg got fertilized! :) Did you take a HPT test yet? I would wait until your period was supposed to start for this month (maybe up to 3 days before) and see if you get a positive! If not, if you are really ancy schedule an appt with a doc for a blood test, but if you want to wait it out a while I would wait a few days after that and take another home test!  i am very impatient and so I ordered some preggo tests off of early-pregnancy-tests.com for like .80 cents a piece so I can test every day because that is how nerdy I am :)<br>  Good luck and TONS of baby dust!|`|jIeupHgJaa	I heard you get sore nipples when your pregnant...|`|AA11459717	Maybe your prego.
hmOidFp3aa	If you got a positive when you took it that Friday I would still say your chances are pretty good! But you should be able to do a HPT test by now, if they are coming up negative get a blood test done it will tell you for sure! I am been having sex every other day because I had some issues with the OPK i used this month. If it doesn't work this month I am not going to use them any more!!! I figure it puts too much stress on it! If the sperm is good for 3 days and you have sex every other day once you are off your period and all month i figure it has to happen to me eventually! Good luck and TONS of baby dust!
KlKomVgPaa	maybe its implantation bleed
wEEOvu5Waa	Because we were 'blessed' of course =P<br>  We get periods, cramps, and outrageous hormones! Some birthday present to us huh? But, it will be all worth it once your baby comes.<br>  <br>  And then if you have a girl, you can explain to her why we were lucky enough to be blessed with the pains of being a woman, while men get to watch from the sidelines lol =P|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Because GOD is a man >=(|`|jhBRNvIxaa	Raging hormones!!! and trust me it only gets worse as you get to your due date... you are so fed up and uncomfy you just want your baby to be here and your moods are going out of whack. just take a break from what you are doing and get a breath of fresh air. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	its all the raging hormones its natural just try to keep calm! congrats and good luck with your little one!!
n3PE2lvDaa	definatly! because it makes childhood so much fun. Christmas was soooo exciting because of Santa clause. And easter would have been boring without the easter bunny. And the toothfairy puts a positive spin on something that may otherwise have been something kides dreaded.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Sorry I totally agree with LITTLE ANGEL. Our kids are still going to enjoy holidays while knowing the truth at the same time. For the person who said that will ruin it for other kids, then maybe you should tell your kids the truth. That's absolutely ridiculous to tell other moms to lie to their kids for the sake of someone else's imagination. I think it's awful and sad. If you choose to tell your kids something then that's your business, but don't suggest that others lie for the sake of fun lol that's crazy. I'm a Christian and proud of it and I plan on raising my kids in that way. If that bothers you then that's your problem, not mine or anyone else who wants to tell their children THE TRUTH.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Telling them that santa, tooth fairy, and easter bunny are real??<br>  Yes! It makes christmas, easter and losing a tooth way more fun!<br>  <br>  or<br>  Telling them that there is no such thing?<br>  not unless they ask...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I'll let them find out on their own. Believing in those things makes childhood so much more fun!|`|GU3RauKOaa	No, I won't ever lie to her about it. We will still do Santa/Easter bunny stuff but she will always know that its not real, just something fun that we celebrate around the holidays.<br>  <br>  We'll still read stories about Santa and paint easter eggs and all that, but she'll know that the stories about Santa are simply stories, just for fun.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I plan on telling my kids that there is a Santa and everything else, it was so fun to believe as a child so why not let my kids enjoy the idea of magic as well.  <br>  My sister decided to tell her kids that there was no such thing.  Her son is 4.  She feels it would be lying to him to tell him they were real and would rather have him knowing the true meaning of Christmas (she's very religious).  She told him this Christmas and talked to him about not telling other kids, but that didn't stop him from arguing with my 8 year old niece about there being no Santa Clause.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i am my whole family does this, as well as my inlaws.  continuing the tradition is easier so my kids dont spoil it for their cousins, plus i love the novelty of it all.  besides makes for bribing into good behavior when holidays come around.  i dont plan on telling them the truth i will let them tell me the truth and when they insist that these things are false i will talk to them about it but remind them that other children believe and they shouldnt ruin it for them.  this is what my mom did and feel it was right.  I think it would have ruined the holidays for me if my parents told me the truth before i figured it out on my own.   i was in high school before i confronted my mom about most of these.  dont get me wrong i knew they were fake, i just didnt want to admit it to my mom who was having fun faking it.  and she didnt want to ruin the fun for me so she didn't bring it up with me.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	Growing up we never celebrated any holidays, not even my b-day. I felt like I missed out a lot times when I watch other kids enjoy themselves. I think it's fun so yes we will celebrate. I guess in a way I make a big deal out of holidays & b-days because I'm making up for my lost. I'm not ever going to tell her the truth.She will find out on her own as she gets older.|`|5ZvALiclaa	no i do not plan on telling them anything unless they come to me.....why ruin a childs innocence??? Let them believe for as long as they can, god only knows they grow up too fast as it is, why ruin the magic of easter and christmas???|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Of course I will tell them about all of those!  That is part of the fun of childhood.  I'll probably tell them the truth once their friends start to figure it out.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Yeah, my daughter thinks that they exist, I think it's cute to have something like that =).<br>  When she asks I guess that I'll tell her they're not real....|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I'll tell her that they're real until some kid spoils it lol|`|O7U1tUaJaa	I already did my oldest just turned 5 and lost her first tooth.  I think that is improves there imagination and make the holidays more fun.  Most moms that I know of that don't tell their child about santa is because that is not what the holiday is about it is about the birth of jesus.  What I do is each year we tell our children the story the night before christmas and the story of the birth of jesus because to me christmas not not just a spiritual holiday.  as far as the easter bunny, it the same thing.  yes it is a religious holiday it's also fun for the children to have that make believe easter bunny come to there house and leave eggs and candy.  as far at the tooth fairy goes, I had Always planned on telling my kids about the tooth fairy.  when my daughter lost her tooth a couple of weeks ago, every time I tried to go in her room she would wake up so the tooth fairy put her prize (she asked me to call the tooth fairy and ask if she would bring her a prize instead of money)on the kitchen table with a note that said this first tooth is a present for your mommy for your baby book so go get it from under your pillow and give it to your mommy.  she was so thrilled and seeing the look in her eyes when she saw her new giant stuffed gorilla was completely priceless.  the memories is mainly why I let my children believe in the fictional holiday characters.<br>  edit* I never plan on telling them the truth unless they come to me and ask.  when they are old enough they will stop believing.  until then I'm going to let them enjoy it.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	I am definately going to tell them about each of them, it's part of the magic of childhood. I even saw the cutest thing at the store, it was a tooth fairy preparedness kit, it had a light so the tooth fairy could find you and a little bag to put the tooth in, and a book that was the story. I will tell her the truth when she asks, but only about each one. <br>  <br>  don't laugh, but I was 12 when I realised the tooth fairy wasn't real and I went to my mom and said" mom the tooth fairy isnt real is it" and she said " no, I guess I better tell you that santa and the easter bunny are not real either." I was crushed. I cried 3 days straight. lmao. If my mom didn't tell my I would prob still think they were real. ridiculous but worth it. there is no other fealing like the magic of santa!|`|RgYuXggfaa	Our kids believe in all of them.  I dont plan on telling them otherwise.  The only reason is because I can remember my dad leaving me a note telling me he saw the tooth fairy on his way to work.  She was leaving my room.  You cant get a better memory than that.  I also saw my mom kissing Santa.  How many of us can say that?  When they come to me with the truth then I will come clean.  Until then, let them enjoy it.|`|Efa5EYJJaa	I'm not going to lie to my child. I will tell him about the real reason for Christmas and Easter. I will still give presents for Christmas, Easter basket and egg hunts, and money for his teeth. I think that will be fun enough without being dishonest. I will tell him the story of all of those things, none are real he can pretend if he wants to.|`|10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	I grew up believing in all three and knowing the meaning behind Christmas and Easter. I plan on letting my son believe in them as long as possible. And when he figures it out I will probably tell him the truth. But I will also tell him about the real reason behind the holidays as well.|`|72503439fe4df370517dbeaf85497f3eaa	I plan to.  It makes their little imaginations soar.  My parents did and yes I was sad when I was old enough to figure out the truth but it was magical while it lasted.  It's all part of being a little kid so why not do it.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I just want to add a comment for people who choose to tell the truth about Santa to their kids because the spirit of Christmas for them is all about Jesus. I understand where you are coming from, but please think about all the kids whose families don't practise Christianity and still celebrate Christmas, for those kids Santa is the magic of the season and if your child is too young to know how to pretend Santa is real they may very well ruin Christmas for other kids. Teaching your 3 yr old the truth about Santa and then letting them go to preschool or playgroup and tell all the other kids that isn't fair.<br>  <br>  Mom of Alex - I'm not saying you have to lie to your kids, just make sure they understand that it's not OK to go around telling other kids that there's no Santa. I don't believe in your God but I would never condone my child telling your kids there's no god right. It's the same thing. A belief is a belief is a belief whether Divine or fantasy. And just a quick question, if Youre so pure about Christmas, do you display all the heathen pagan solstice symbols of fertility and rebirth? You know the decorated tree, the mistletoe, the apple cider, bells and yule logs? Or do you pick and choose your righteousness ? hmm I wonder.<br>  <br>  And I do tell my children the truth in that we are not celebrating the birth of Jesus, historical records place his birth in the middle of summer. We are celebrating the winter solstice. The fact that we have made it through the dark nights and now the sun has returned to the land and the days will get longer and warmer. The pagan birth of the SUN. Not the birth of a SON.|`|zwctZ812aa	I definitely will! It makes holidays so much more fun for kids.  I know some people who don't do it because they don't want to lie to their children, but I don't think I was emotionally scarred from my parents lying to me about those things, and I doubt my kids will be either.  I don't plan on telling them they aren't real...I think they will figure it out in school and stuff and once they're like 8 or 9 if they ask, I will tell them the truth.  That's about the age I was when I figured it out.
7JEojMgQaa	Great suggestions already. I have very little to add except that no matter how hard it would be to look at I would look anyway. I have been in reunion for 9 years with my daughter and have yet to see any pictures of her as a child. There is a reason for it though, and I will have to wait. A lock of hair is one thing I think would have been most memorable to me. Include what his/her favorite things are, like mac and cheese or kidney beans. Favorite movies, I would have bought a copy and watched it just to feel close to her. We wore out jungle book and Fern gully with my other two, and baby songs by Raffi. DVD's with pictures set to music are really wonderful, each shot changes after 4 seconds or so. If you can film them singing to a song and then use that song as your background music so she can see them singing it as well as hear the song. It would have to be longer than 4 seconds, but you get my drift. I would also think about boxing up some things for her, baby shoes, well loved stuffed animal that is no longer needed, blanket, favorite outfit, no matter how old or tattered, as long as it was well used and loved by the child. I even kept my sons first pacifiers that the hospital issued, their first baby balloons, (mylar of course rubber would decinigrate) I still have them all. As they grow out of them set them aside, they will have another use one day. <br>  <br>  I agree that sending it would be a mistake at this time. All your efforts may be for nothing. I have heard repeatedly that things do not get passed along. Hang on to them for now and see what happens down the road. <br>  <br>  Thank You for making this effort. It means more than you can ever know. I can't think of one single solitary thing that would be considered too silly, but that depends on the person I guess.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	From an adoptee's standpoint, a scrap book is a great idea. I know looking at through the pics of my n family is a gift I treasure more than anyone could ever imagine. BUT- it's extremely painful at the same time. It made my losses visual. It made them real. Alive, even....even though my adoption was almost 43 years ago. <br>   <br>  For my n Mom, she could not look at pictures of me as a child for years after I found her, and I found her when I was 22. It was the same thing- it made her loss too real. <br>   <br>  BUT- times were  different during the baby scoop era. The pain is no different, but the whole process was a bit different. <br>   <br>  I think you should go ahead with the book. It don't think it will seem superficial to her. I do think if there is a way for you to get it to her yourself, that would be best. Most letters and packages sent to agencies never make it to the first mom, or the adoptive parents.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Opedial,<br>  <br>  I am so glad that you are doing this! It is a wonderful gesture and I'm sure it will be cherished. A scrapbook is always a very appreciated gift. <br>  <br>  Some suggestions for things to include in your scrapbook:<br>  <br>  *pictures and notes (Obviously ;)) A mix of you and the kids and just the kids is great!<br>  *children's drawings (The kids don't have to know they are for their other mother if they are not supposed to "participate at this time".)<br>  *hand prints <br>  *cute school work (creative writing, crafts, etc.)<br>  *copies of sports records, programs from performances, achievement awards or report cards (Obviously with necessary censoring if safety is a serious concern.)<br>  *copy of the child(ren)'s favorite lyrics, story, religious verse, poem etc.<br>  *a page of funny things the kids have said<br>  *small "found" items like a button from a coat, a barrette, etc. that was worn by the child(ren)<br>  *Lock of hair from a recent cut<br>  <br>  Don't worry about putting in things that might upset her. (ALL of it will but it is ok.) SHE is a big girl and is capable of determining what she is ready to look at. Send it and let HER decide.<br>  <br>  Express how you feel and your concerns for HER feelings, share that you are keeping her a part of your children's family and I PROMISE, it will be the farthest thing from "superficial" to HER!|`|yDWcYXl5aa	I'd make a scrapbook of every moment for yourself, and one for her also, but wait to give it to her, until she is ready for it.  By getting it now, it can make her losses that more real.  She'll have to come to peace with what she's done to be separated from her children.  I think it's great that you remember their first mom, and appreciate the fact that if it weren't for her, you wouldn't have these children, but at the same time, something's happened that they were taken away.<br>  <br>  A scrapbook with lots of journalizing is great.  Show the first teeth, the playground, normal times, and holidays.  <br>  <br>  I'd also put a serious page in there with a picture of the child looking serious and the saying, "I wonder what he/she was thinking about here".  Perhaps the first mom will realize at that point that there are times the kids think of her. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your project.  Also, by putting in traces of their handprints, copies of artwork, and stuff like that, it makes it really fun.  It's something that the child will appreciate years later also.|`|sbHJCxWCaa	What if you do a video/picture slideshow? You could take some footage of the kids and then mix it in with some snapshot pictures and music. You could also write a letter about how you're feeling and what your child is going through, etc.|`|MzHwklzKaa	I think a scrapbook is a great idea.<br>  <br>  How about doing "a day in the life" page(s).  Show her with pictures and journaling what the kid does each day.|`|98cAYrhQaa	She abandoned more than one kid?? That is horrific. I think you should make her a scrap book about birth control.|`|OoftsMLhaa	whole idea is a mistake|`|HirNQJu7aa	Kids|`|n9aE7gJQaa	Footprints and handprints is a good project and placing a picture between both. I have great poem at work regarding one mother gave you birth the other gave you life. I dont know it by heart but it is something I use with the girls I work with and for my self. <br>  <br>  Once there were two women<br>  living half a world apart.<br>  God joined these women together<br>  with a common thread between their hearts.<br>  <br>  In one, He created a life,<br>  a beautiful baby girl.<br>  In the other, He planted an idea,<br>  weighing it heavily on her soul.<br>  <br>  The first, heartbroken, faith strong,<br>  knew the baby wasn't hers to raise.<br>  She watched as the baby was taken,<br>  and knelt down to God in praise.<br>  <br>  The second, frightened, faith strong,<br>  asked God to hold her hand<br>  as she traveled toward a dream<br>  to an unfamiliar, distant land.<br>  <br>  The baby, she was beautiful,<br>  an angelic Asian face.<br>  She stared, wide-eyed and curious,<br>  as into her mother's arms she was placed.<br>  <br>  And there were tears full of sadness<br>  as one mother's heart wept.<br>  And there were tears full of gladness<br>  as one mother's heart leapt.<br>  <br>  Two very different women<br>  with a common circumstance.<br>  Each asking for God's guidance<br>  instead of leaving life to chance.<br>  <br>  Two very different women<br>  who love the same little girl,<br>  praying to God daily<br>  to guide her through this world.<br>  <br>  And though they'll never meet,<br>  they are forever joined heart to heart<br>  by the same awesome God,<br>  lands apart.<br>  <br>  Written By: Adoptive Parent, Shannon|`|r9nxFkGtaa	I think a scrapbook is a great idea.  It should include photos of the kids, some with you and some by themselves.  The pics should have captions, little comments like "Here is baby's first tooth.  It appeared [date]."<br>  <br>  At this point, I would keep the scrapbook and keep adding to it as the years go by to record milestones.  Don't give it to the birth mother until she and the kids are ready.  I think when the kids are adults would be best.<br>  <br>  I put my first son up for adoption when he was born in 1975.  We were reunited in 1997 and he gave me a scrapbook that he and his wife made for me.  It was wonderful to have pieces of his childhood that I had been unable to share in.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Don't take notice of the negative responses.<br>  <br>  My son's adoption was closed and had they done a scrapbook to give to me one day I would have treasured it with all my heart.  Include photographs of both you and them and ones of children together plus individual ones.  Add a journal too as she will find that help her process her own thoughts and feelings as well as making it more personal,<br>  <br>  You're being thoughtful wanting to do this.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Put in school items, school pictures, maybe not too many pictures from their home life of all the things she couldn't give them. I do think this is a great idea.|`|GBKaftrJaa	Pictures, a journal, videos, anything that tells her about her kids.<br>  <br>  I finally got a picture of my son when he was maybe 6 months old and that was so healing. I took comfort in the mom's handwriting being legible... just ANYTHING.<br>  <br>  Moms want to know everything about their children.  Tell her as much as you can.  Tell her about yourself.  Tell her about the kids.  Tell her what they do in a typical day.<br>  <br>  And that's nice you are trying.

eY3SWMdqaa	You could be pregnant. Some woman get pregnant right away! But, it could also be your body reacting from getting off the pill.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Why are you taking birth control if you want to be pregnant? That seems silly to me! You might be! I have some answer preggo tests and they can test 3 days before you miss your period and doctor blood tests can test even 2 daysish before that! I hope we are both pregnant this month!|`|dSobv28maa	b/c? birth control?<br>  wh are you taking it if your trying to get pregnant
17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	It must have just been a coincidence, theyve done studies that show youd have to stimulate your nipples for days in order to release enough hormones to bring labor on|`|AA10526033	yea ive never heard of that working and really have never understood how it would.
wKuQC4yTaa	yes especially when she hits my cervix all day|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Yes.the farther i got into my pregnancy the stronger his kicks get and sometimes they hurt.but it doesn't bother me though..|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Lol, yes, they actually can be pretty uncomfortable at times.  At 31 weeks, he will sometimes give me a jab so hard at the side of my belly that I actually squirm.  It tickles in a way...but it is also rather painful.|`|1o820L3Daa	Yeah, sometimes it does. I was just picking my daughter up and my little man moved and kicked me in the side of my stomach. And seemed to stay there. I could feel his arm or leg when I pushed on my stomach. It hurt, and felt like a bad stitch. Im 23 weeks pregnant.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	It can but with twins, your going to feel the kicks in places you wouldn't with just one. Hope this helps.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	YES.
NMzlbWt8aa	This is normal.  Its your uterus growing to accomidate the baby.  So long as there is no spotting or lower back pain with the cramps you have nothing to worry about.  I took lots of walks and a warm... not hot bath and some tylenol.  Stay away from the heating pads... those are a not a good thing now.|`|07b451c57b519f0c6b496320de3d2deeaa	Ive had the same problem alot, Its just the strectching the doctor said. I have had a miscarriage so i was really worried. I would ask your doctor. If you start to get lower back pain and it gets severe like contractions then you should go to a hospital. But maybe your body is just adjusting 2 a second pregnancy :) good luck
62fG4UN0aa	Sorry that is a poor quality image. The tech could have lowered the depth and zoomed the image better..I should know I am a ultrasound tech registered in OB/GYN. I like how everybody is a expert on here reading ultrasounds. I for one like the one who says they where pre-med and there call name is teen age girl...hummm sounds fishy to me. Well anyways I think most likely that you are having a girl but the image is of poor qauility. Who ever says they are seeing a three lines on that ultrasound are seeing things. Sorry about the low quality image I would have gave you a better image. Good Luck and maybe you get better pictures if you have to have another ultrasound.|`|uNsWwMfwaa	It's true about the "3 line rule" and it being a girl. Two tests that can be performed during pregnancy, amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, can both reveal the gender of your baby with accuracy.  <br>  <br>  Amniocentesis<br>  This procedure is used to extract amniotic fluid from around the baby in order to test for complications. The fluid is removed by using a needle inserted into the abdomen around 16 - 18 weeks. Women over the age of 35 are recommended to get this test done due to the increased risk of Down's syndrome presented by advanced maternal age. This test will reveal: Chromosomal Disorders, 200 Single Gene Disorders, Baby's Gender .  This test does carry risks to both baby and mother though and you should discuss those risks with your doctor.<br>  <br>  The other test, Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)<br>  This test is usually performed 10 - 12 weeks after the last menstrual period. Your doctor will take a tiny tissue sample from outside the sac where the fetus develops. The tissue is tested to diagnose or rule out certain birth defects. There is a higher risk of miscarriage with this method than with the amniocentesis.|`|gT31DB1caa	where the pic is very white and above the words you can see something like this III alot of ultrasound techs call it the three line rule three lines is a baby girl.|`|GLfsQ9P7aa	The picture isn't very clear at all.  Will you be getting another ultra sound done later?  Hopefully the next one would be more clear and you'll feel a bit more confident of the sex.|`|rPhP6ILgaa	looks like three lines that normally indicate a girl!!!|`|z2p9JPwZaa	It looks like a girl to me. Congrats|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	idk where they see a girl........or a baby for that matter. thats probably why im not an ultrasound tech|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	wow my babies pic were very clear this one isnt as much i guess a girl|`|ca9dEvSAaa	That's a really blurry picture.

hmOidFp3aa	I had no idea what it was so I just looked it up! That looks pretty neat, the only high tech thing I had seen so far was the clear blue fertility monitor! But that requires urine sampling--hmm reacts to sodium ions? That sounds strange--Ill keep an eye out on this question and see what people have to say. I have just been using answer ovulation kits! Good luck and TONS of baby dust
AA11764194	Sorry for what you are going thru.. my suggestion is get HCG done..<br>  <br>  During my last pregnancy after getting positive pregnancy result I got heavy bleeding.. i thought I miscarried..when I went to my Doc she did not see anything in Scan (it was too early)  but took the blood, later she called me saying I am still pregnant.. <br>  <br>  as the pregnancy developed I came to know I am expecting Twins.. <br>  My friend joked that I must be carrying triplets..<br>  <br>  so you can not say anything unless you get yourself checked.. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|6pLLPdPwaa	First off.. I am sorry for your loss. And let me say, I have had 2 miscarriages but not with twins. From what I have heard, most times if you lose one, you lose the other. I hope for your sake this is not true. Also, I would confront your doctor about lying. That is very illegal and I would definantly think about changing doctors! Who needs a dishonest doc??
28WJwHf4aa	Your baby should be fine. Drinking small quantities of caffeine won't harm him/her. <br>  <br>  If you absolutely must have your daily pop, and are worried about your caffeine consumption, try to only keep caffeine-free pop in the house. That way if you are tempted and drink a can, it will be okay.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Calm down its fine!  If you only did it once then you will both be ok, I promise.  I used to drink one Coke every couple days (sometimes every day)  and my daughter is a healthy 14 month old.|`|qga7GDPNaa	You will be fine! Try not to get so worried about things like that...in the end, as long as you generally ate/drank everything in moderation, baby will be fine. I tried hard to cut down on caffeine, but sometimes I would have a strong starbucks coffee or something, and my baby was and is perfectly healthy.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Don't worry about it. =) It doesn't sound like you've been downing caffeine all day everyday, so you have nothing to worry about. You're doing a wonderful job drinking water to stay hydrated, though. The carbonation in pop dehydrates your body. I have pop everyday, sometimes the equivalent of one can. My baby is perfectly healthy and soon to be born. Good luck and don't worry too much, dear! You are not causing any birth defects by drinking Pepsi.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	I craved Pepsi and ice with my 1st child.He turned out just fie.He weighed 6 pounds and had no health issue.With my other 2 kids I drank Mt dew.You just need to cut down and don;t drink as much as you did when you was Not expecting.Congrats and Best of luck.|`|AA10526033	lol your baby will be fine. ive had 3 kids and noone was keeping me away from my soda! the only reason you arent supposed to drink it is because it will fill you up and you may not eat as much. atleast thats what my drs told me with each kid! they are and were all perfectly healthy|`|gYkQc8Lraa	no|`|AA10571513	I have a friend who was addicted to pepsi the entire pregnancy and everything turned out fine. She drank a supersize drink once a week or more. Although, the baby did kick her alot and ended up doing things like somersaults in her belly. I wouldn't worry about two. Really, I think a caffiene drink once in a great while when pregnant isn't going to hurt - but recent studies do show that caffiene tends to cause issues with baby's heart - even a little bit - so I always avoided it for the most part. None of my kids had issues and I had a bit of caffiene probably 3 or 5 times during the pregnancy. But, if you're drinking 8 cups of coffee in a day - that could definitely cause problems. I had 4 kids and one miscarriage but the miscarriage wasn't due to caffiene because I didn't have any - it was an early miscarriage probably due to chromosomal defects it was like a blighted ovum.|`|G766dQjtaa	No sweetie you did not cause any harm. Some doctors say caffeine is not good in big amounts but ok in small amounts, mine told me that coffee every other day is fine just not too much. I drink Starbucks once every other weeks and pepsi 2 to 3 times a week and some times 2 or 3 cans every other day. I'm due in about a week and my baby has been very healthy since day one. But just so you are sure ask your doctor how much coffee does he/she says is alright for you to drink.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|MKnpH4XKaa	I doubt it that's all I drunk with my first pregnancy and my daughter is just fine.<br>  <br>  I love Mountain dews and that's what im drinking now with this pregnancy and water also.<br>  <br>  but some say it isn't good for the baby tho I would just stick with like one can of pepsi drink juice or water that's what im going to do.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	You're okay.  But I wouldn't do it again.  I have caffeine free Pepsi in the house and it's really not bad.  I actually could barely taste the difference at first and now, I don't even notice it's caffeine free.  It satisfies those cravings without any guilt or harm!|`|sAbah6dTaa	definately not... don't even worry about it. now if you're drinking like 10 cans a day, that is extreme, but two cans i say wouldn't hurt a thing...<br>  <br>  now if it was beer that's another thing.<br>  <br>  stop worrying =)|`|wKuQC4yTaa	you & baby are fine. it is not good to have mass quantities of caffeine all the time but once and a while is ok. its proven that one cup of coffee a day has no effect on a fetus.|`|07b451c57b519f0c6b496320de3d2deeaa	Im sure your okay! You can have up to two cans of pop a day. I know people who drank alot of caffieneated drinks and there babys were fine! :) Hope it helps|`|vlCtpi5Oaa	Please don't worry.  Two cans of soda are not going to harm your child.  When I was pregnant with my son, and I am currently 37 weeks now, I occasionally drank a caffinated beverage.

nrqWwQBXaa	yes and there is a law about it. if you try to keep your kid away from them they can go to court and get visitation rights. it is dumb but for some reason the courts think they have a right to there kids kids?|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I don't know for every state.

ATjJNDT1aa	Somewhere like Kalbarri or Coral Bay are absolutely fantastic places to go to with kids. They are both on the coast, generally not HUGELY busy (like the Gold Coast), aren't hugely expensive (but aren't cheap either) and are really nice & fun to stay at. There are some gorgeous resorts to stay at, at both.. Both of them you can hire houses to stay in for however long you want too. The beaches are beautiful and clean, and definately kid friendly.<br>  <br>  Another plus is that the town centres are both quite small, so you can generally walk to where you want to go, and there's a nice pub in both towns plus cafes that are nice too :)|`|K1kZlWY8aa	The Gold Coast is really nice, I went up there when I was younger and plan to take my daughter soon.<br>  What state do you live in? Going somewhere as simple as a beach can be really nice.<br>  I'd say go to the Gold Coast though, it is realllyyy fun. My friend also said that NZ is nice, as she went there, but can get a bit cold.
LV8dLB2zaa	Please don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you're in love with the kids, not the man.<br>  Tread carefully, there are 4 people involved here and questions need to be asked and answered truthfully.<br>  Do you want to be Florence Nightingale and save the kids from their wretched lives... of which you know nothing?<br>  Do you want to save the man from a life of solo parenthood?<br>  Are the kids just soooo cute, like puppies, that you want one?<br>  Are you willing to take on a family , of which you also know nothing?<br>  Are you ready to take on an ex-wife, who feels nothing about walking away from her 2 kids?<br>  Many more things to be asked here, but wouldn't asking the guy out for a coffee and a chat be the sensible thing to do before you jump in blindly to save his family?|`|sGUPNkQdaa	speaking from experience... i fell in love with my daughter's the day i met them, my wife had three beautiful baby girls before we met. so i came in and adopted my girls into my life and heart.<br>  However taking into consideration the heartbreaking situation, they're real father emancipated himself, i knew I would and WILL not walk out of they're live. parenting is not easy, its takes work, patience, love and lots of time and dedication. it can get hurtful but its all rewarding in the end. im in love with my daughters.<br>  <br>  but consider the pain we may cause when we're in and out of they're live. be sure your there to stay and demonstrate structure family structure.not all kids can handle that. consider that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Well their mom left them, so there are some serious abandonment issues that could come.  Especially if you become their number 1 woman, then leave too.  Don't enter their lives lightly.  If you want to be a parent, do your research.  And make sure you think he's a good dad.|`|AA10953561	There's a lot of hardship in relationships that involve children. I'm a step mom to a six year old. She loves me and I love her. She is aware of the fact that I am not her biological mother and plays that card often. I'm the one who has to teach her discipline because her father is trying to make up for the fact that her mother is a dead beat. Don't get me wrong, being a mother (even a step-mom) is vastly rewarding, but it's very hard to be a step-mom.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should consider a relationship based on the two children alone. That's just not smart thinking. If you consider a relationship it should be for the man. Remember children grow up and leave home, but you'd be stuck with the husband.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BmSZz00Eaa	If these 2 little girls have been without a mother,  they are so young!<br>  You should do just fine.  Will the mother have  visitation? If so, then <br>  you may have problems. I hate to say this, but my daughter is dating a guy that has kids, a boy, 10 and a girl 17. The boy is spoiled rotten, rude, obnoxious, and was never made to mind, or was disciplined. The girl is better, but was never made to do anything.(help with house,dishes,etc) My daughter and he have broken up 2 times, cause she can't handle the kids.  All I can say is BEWARE!   My husband <br>  had kids, but  one was in 20's and the other 30.  The only problem we had is the grandkids. We can't even watch them without tranquilizers.(for us, not the kids) They are so spoiled, and won't mind. I am expected to fix 3 meals, one for me and my husband, one for her, and one for him. This is grandkids. By the way, they haven't been here since They have  to eat the same thing we eat.<br>  <br>  People,PLEEEEZE make your kids mind. Discipline your kids.

i3t1BhNmaa	ovulation occurs about two weeks after the start of your period (the first day of your menstrual cycle). If the stars align, that's when conception happens too. Typically, one of your ovaries releases an egg 12 to 16 days after your cycle begins. It then travels from the ovary through the fallopian tube toward the uterus. But it only lives about 24 hours, so it must meet up with a sperm during that time to make a baby. Each ejaculation contains 30 to 300 million sperm cells (which can live in a woman’s body for up to 72 hours), but it only takes one to fertilize the egg.<br>  <br>  Egg membrane also forms a pretty effective roadblock -- though it thins out on the most fertile days of the cycle. Throw in the long distance from However, those millions of swimmers encounter some obstacles along the way. The vagina is an acidic environment that's tough on sperm, and cervical mucuscervix, through uterus, to fallopian tube and it's a pretty rough journey. If the sperm and egg do meet, the sperm must burrow into the egg's outer coating. Once the genetic material starts to combine, you've got yourself an embryo. The embryo then travels back down into the uterus and implants itself in the wall, and congratulations -- you're pregnant!<br>  <br>  The reason for the two bonus weeks of pregnancy? Your doctor can't be sure exactly when you ovulated, but she can be sure of the date your cycle started, so she counts from then.

IGwX328eaa	You can probably have your husband sleep next to you so he doesn't roll over. But i used a moses basket in my bed for a few weeks then at about 3 weeks i just took him out and put him next to me. do you have an infant positioner you can use that. I know a lot of people say you can roll over your baby while co-sleeping but I have never rolled on my son <br>  <br>  heres a website to read more tips<br>  <a href="http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-ap/312-co-sleeping-safety.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-ap/...</a>|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Buy a toddler bed rail, you will need it later when baby goes into a big girl bed anyway. put the rail on your side of the bed and have baby sleep between you and the rail. if there is any gap between the mattress and the rail stuff it with rolled up blankets or towels or a crib bumper pad, tuck your blanket and sheets in really tight at the bottom of the bed so that they stay low on the bed and can't be pulled up over baby's head accidental. remove the pillows from the area directly above baby and use more rolled up blankets or a body pillow to fill any gaps between the top of the bed and the wall or head board. <br>  <br>  Some people use the regular blankets on baby, and some keep the regular blankets away from baby and use a sleep sack or swaddle them instead, the choice is yours but don't use both, baby will get too hot. keep your room between 16 - 20 degrees C just like you would keep the nursery if she was sleeping in there and use a night light or dim lamp so you can always she where she is if you wake up at night.|`|u94HOVz7aa	if you find a good solution let me know i have the same problem as you my hubby is a heavy sleeper and i am a light sleeper (when i have a baby) so i couldnt co-sleep.  i usually end up in the rocking chair sleeping with the little on on my chest cause he is having touble sleeping in his crib and daddy squishes him in our bed.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	You can google "safe co-sleeping" and read up a bunch on that.  <br>  <br>  Keep your sleep surface firm (no water beds, down mattresses, and air mattresses (some say it's fine, but others don't)).<br>  <br>  Only use necessary bedding.  Sleep under as few covers as possible and keep them light and easily breathable.  That probably means not using your comforter, but you can dress a bit warmer or turn up the heat a bit, and use a lighter blanket to sleep under if you need a blanket to sleep (I do!).  Make sure your fitted sheets don't pull up in the corners.  <br>  <br>  Position your baby between you and a wall rather than you and your hubby, but you're already doing this.  Check your bed every time before getting in to make sure it is pushed up against the wall and hasn't slipped a bit.  This becomes an easy and quick habit, though.  <br>  <br>  Don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, and avoid over the counter medications that make you feel loopy.<br>  <br>  If you're over weight, lose some weight (yeah, long term, but still...).|`|OrKpKxkHaa	*waiting for thumbs down* lol Anyway, the best way we found was with the bed pushed against the wall, baby next to the wall, me in the middle and hubby on the end. It sucked if I had to get up in the middle of the night, I had to crawl to the end but it was really the only way that worked. We tried baby in the middle but aside from my hubby being nervous, we slept so far away from her, we ended up hanging off the bed lol. I also turned my baby sideways so her feet pushed against my stomach so if I did happen to roll over (never did) I would roll onto her legs and not her face. Good luck!|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I have co-slept since the day my son was born, my son is now 17 months old. <br>  <br>  Co-sleeping can have a lot of benefits if done safely. It reduces the chances of sids because the baby will mimic the mother's breathing.<br>  <br>  Here are a few ideas to make it safer, though I am sure you are doing just fine :)<br>  <br>  You could get a side rail for the bed and put it on your side. They have em at walmart and babies r us. It goes between the mattress and box spring and your baby cannot fall off of the bed (which is always a big worry when co-sleeping).<br>  <br>  Don't use any big fluffy or extremely thick blankets. <br>  <br>  Hold the baby so she doesn't roll around and get under your blanket or into any unsafe positions.<br>  <br>  I thought I had more ideas than that but I guess thats it :) I would really get the side rail thing though, its very helpful and takes a lot of worry out of co-sleeping.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	You can buy a co sleeper to have her sleep in in your bed or even an infant positioner might help you make sure she doesn't get rolled onto.  If you continue to co sleep when the baby is old enough to roll around I would suggest putting your mattress on the floor in case she rolls out of bed.|`|8fw3zE3gaa	She sleeps on myside with her head on my upper arm and my lower arm next to her.

During those first months, It feels Right to do it. You and baby nestled in together, your body regulating the temperature of you little ones. So close your baby can smell you and can be comforted by the sound of your breathing,just like she heard while in the womb. When she is hungry, just a little figiting will rouse you out of sleep to attend to her. When you feed her, you just have to roll over.  <br>  My little guy is 4 months now, and WILL fall asleep on his own for bed or daytime naps. Sometimes after feeding He will be awake, and if I just leave him be, and he will go to sleep.  Its wonderful to feel those little feet find a warmth on your stomach, and a hand touching your hand. <br>  As for my personal experience, till your little girl gets bigger, it IS very scary, what I did, i laid in my bed diagonally, my head and upper body against my partner, and my one leg bent at the knee touching my little boys legs.  That way, whenever he rouses, I would be alerted, and my upper body was a bit of a distance away to prevent any ideas of rolling over.  Some nights, i must admit... I wouldn't want to stop cuddling with my little boy, and I would sleep right up against him, (he would fidget over till his body was up against mine anyways). I never ever ever, rolled over onto him.. I think its a NEW MOMMY instinct to always have an ear or eye on your little one.<br>  Do what makes you most comfortable, ever think about those co sleepers that attach to your bed?<br>  Good luck|`|bql2RJzWaa	When my son was born, they didn't suck out all the mucus from his throat...My first night in the hospital with him was so scary.

He was choking on the phlegm & I didn't even know! When she brought him back in, I slept sitting up with him...He's been sleeping with me since. <br>  I now have a 2 month old & she sleeps with me every so often.<br>  Us 3 actually sleep diagonally on my queen sized bed. There is plenty of room. I put a pillow beside my son so he doesn't roll over. I keep the baby up, by my face. Make sure there is no blankets (or a lose sheet). Your bed can't be too soft, either. I, too am a light sleeper, so it works for me. When she's in her bassinet, I'm always checking on her anyway...Poor hubby sleeps a lone in my son's room. At least we took the car bed out & put in a regular bed;)|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	I've always co-slept with my children. I have my bed against the wall and the baby sleeps next to it. I sleep in the middle and my hubby on the end. I am a very light sleeper and don't usually move in my sleep. Just be sure to keep pillows and blankets away from the baby. I let my son sleep in a sleeper and a baby blanket over him. Even when they get older I find it easier to continue to let them have their own blankets.|`|AoF6qxV9aa	I co-slept my son and still do occasionally, they make little co sleepers that are kind of like a mat with four low sides so the infant still feels close to you but there is a barrier.|`|AA11256693	Just make the area as safe as you can, no pillows or blankets near her face. Make sure no one takes medications that can alter sleep states and that you can sleep and be aware of her. I co-slept with both my kids, and my daughter slept many nights on one of our chests so that she could sleep without spitting up. She still crawls in bed with us many nights and we don't mind.<br>  People do it all the time, in some countries parents wouldn't dream of NOT cosleeping.<br>  Mostly, tune out the doom sayers. Smile and change the subject.|`|O7U1tUaJaa	first off a baby should be able to turn it's head if it were to spit up or vomit at this age.  second off, you can prop up the mattress in the crib and that would be safer.  They also make something that you can buy at the store for co-sleeping which makes it safer but still not completely safe.  putting the baby in a swing or bounce chair would also help.  I'm not trying to lecture you at all.  I've done it a couple of times myself on accident but given that you know the risk involved why would you take that chance?  My cousin smothered her 3 month old two years ago.  she said she had no idea how it could have possibly happened.  she is a very light sleeper and said she doesn't move in her sleep but really how can you possibly know that you don't move?  your sleeping.  given that there are many other choices I do not see why you have to let your child sleep in your bed.  also I'm curious, does you child not sleep on her back in your bed?  do you have a reclining bed and if so where did you get it cause I want one?

Like my daughters Chelsey (5) and Annabella (3) love going to the park or to run around or go for a swim but in side they normally play babies and shops but to make playing dolls fun give a doll (if you have not got dolls use any stuffed toy or teddy bear) and show them how to hold it and then take them to the shop with there dolls (not a real shop just a made up 1 like set up in a bed roomor some where) and let the buy fake food or something i do that with my girls. But make sure you let them help you cook tea this gives you something to say if they don't eat there dinner you can say but you made that yummy food and look i'm eating it. Now bath time can be fun if you have bubble bath (if not get it). Before bed get them to choose a book (team work) together and read it to them. Then let them go to sleep if one of them get home sick you have to like say well guess what mummy and daddy have had to go because mummy is having your new little baby brother and we can't make her come and get you because she needs to look after your brother and you will be able to see him soon. Then maby the next day for lets say lunch make a picnic and have it in  the back yard if you don't have a back yard then have it in side.|`|3ZiQreGoaa	i know what your going though. I have 4 kids myself 7(g),6(b),3(g),& 2(b) and my niece and her husband moved in temporally due to financial reasons while having their house built and they have 5 kids, 10(b),8(g),6(g),4(g),&4(b). they worked odd hrs so myself and my husband usually had all the kids to ourselves. It was chaotic but somehow we managed. We would separate the girls from the boys just to prevent arguments. the girls would do each others hair and nails and sometimes play makeup(if they were lucky), the boys would play video and board games, Twister was a hit with all the kids. But on school nights we had a strict schedule to go by. We did homework at 4 plus a snack, then the had free time. We would double up on baths. This was my order or baths, my 7 & 3 yr old girls, 6(mine) 4(theirs) & 2 (mine) yr old boys, 10 yr old boy, and their 8, 6 & 4 girls together in the shower at once. Meals were like a cafeteria, plates lined up in a row and i would serve going down the line. The older girls would help me serve the kids. Everyone sat at the table. Bedtime was a strict 8:30pm after that many kids the earlier you can get to bed the better it is for you. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	First of you are crazy lol for having so many young ones in your home. <br>  <br>  But maybe one night if its the weekend you all could have a girls slumber party. Hair, make up, movie, popcorn, the works. If you have a video game system maybe you could rent or barrow a couple girl kid friendly games for them to play. Coloring books and crayons are cheap and easy.  Maybe you could also have all the girls make cards for the new mom and baby. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you have let them all stay before, but you should set up some ground rules for them being there, so things don't get out of hand.|`|uwQYKO1baa	I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAD TO DO THIS.  LET THEM HANDLE EACH OTHER! ! LOL - SERIOUSLY, WHEN THERE ARE THAT MANY THEY TEND TO ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER. YOU JUST RELAX & LET THE KIDS BE KIDS AND IF THERE DISSAPOINTED, TOUGH. I LOVE THE KIDS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE JUST TOO SPOILED SOMETIMES... HOPE THIS HELPS  :O)|`|oP504BtFaa	Recruit the older ones to help out. Talk to your six year old beforehand and hype it up and tell her how much fun it will be. Ask her if she'll be willing to be your helper for the next three days, usually kids, especially little girls, LOVE that.<br>  <br>  Try to get your nieces to help, too, but if they don't, don't push it. Unless they are being outwardly rude and cruel to others, I wouldn't be on their cases. It's a three night stay - does it matter INCREDIBLY if they just watch TV or read a book or play exclusively with each other? Encourage them and your older daughter to hang out together. As for the little ones, just make sure you have crafts on hand as well as a few quiet movies for nap time. Having the kids help you make meals is also a good way to keep them busy and have help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? Just get a lot of craft stuff, and crayons. Get some movies they would like. Buy things that would make as quick dinners, like KD. Good Luck, you'll need it. ?¤·?
6pLLPdPwaa	Well... those are all classic signs of pregnancy. I would go to the doctor if I were you. If not, at least take another pregnancy test. you sound like you might be kind of young, so if this pregnancy is not a good thing, you need to talk to someone you trust about getting you to a doctor. Good luck either way.|`|KlKomVgPaa	you are likely to be pregnant .you can do a HPT now...and confirm it ..|`|HQE8Yvicaa	the light bleeding could have been implantation bleeding. especially since it never turned into a heavier period bleed. you should def go to the doctor and get a blood test done! it sounds to me like theres a good chance you could be pregnant! good luck!
irHF6CBPaa	I try to breastfeed my son with no luck so I bought an electric breast pump to give him what ever came out but it began to be such a hassle that I just did it for a month and eventually just formula feed No one tells you that breast feeding will be so hard Just buy and electric brest pump if you plan on using it but you have to pump every 2 hours to keep up with baby's demand don't get bully by people telling you have to breast feed you do what works for you and your baby|`|aqto0hJTaa	It's a PITA to pump (IMO).  If you want to nurse her, just nurse her.  You'll get used to it.  It won't hurt for too long.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to nurse, just don't do it.  Your breasts will hurt like crazy, but it'll be over in less than a week if you don't pump or nurse.<br>  <br>  You're going to have to feel some pain either way.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	You can do basically whatever you want. It would be a great idea to pump and give her breast milk in a bottle (especially if you're very tender). It's possible the tenderness is because you're just not used to having a baby sucking on your nipples. It could also be that she's not latching on correctly. You could continue to try, and if it's still too difficult, I'd say contact your lactation nurse at your drs office. Good luck!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	she is not latching right if it hurts so much you don't want to keep doing it, so I recommend talking to a lactation counselor. If you just have had it though, then yes, you can pump it, and there is still a type of bonding experience during feeding. I just recommend making sure you are sure you want to stop, because no matter what anyone tells you, there IS such think as nipple confusion and she may not ever take the breast after you introduce the bottle.<br>  I would really like to see "formula feeding nazi" aka formula feeding @$$**** just go away and leave the people who don't chose to do what she does alone lol|`|8fw3zE3gaa	Yeah it hurts like crazy at first. It took me 4 weeks till my poor cracked nips healed up and it did not hurt. In fact I'm feeding her right now. <br>  <br>  You can pump and feed lots of women do it and itbetter for your baby and free. <br>  <br>  If you can deal with the pain for a few weeks it does get better and is so easy no matter were we are the milk is always ready I love it. <br>  <br>  But pump and feed is good too.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Honestly, I tried this, and can no longer breastfeed.<br>  <br>  My milk dried up so fast, despite my constant pumping, a lactation consultant, and all these hippy beans that allegedly help you produce milk.<br>  <br>  So take into consideration your breast milk supply may decline, as mine did.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Your baby is just 5 days old, you need to give it time!!! Your nipples and breasts will hurt for a bit but there are things you can do to make it better. <br>  Firstly, don't stop breastfeeding, even if you want to continue pumping sometimes, you have to keep breastfeeding in order to maintain the right amount of milk for your baby. Pumping just doesn't maintain milk the same way a nursing baby does.<br>  Secondly go and buy some LANSINOH nipple cream. Its an all natural lanolin based cream that you put on before and after each feeding and makes a sh**load of difference trust me!!<br>  Thirdly, make sure that your baby is latching on correctly. Place her belly against your belly using support pillows under her, under your elbow and behind your back. Depending which side you are feeding from, use your thumb and index finger of your free hand, put them around the nape of her neck/back of her head, wait for her to open her mouth wide and then push her mouth onto your aereola/nipple making sure that her lips are not pinched in but are curling right around your aereola. If you are latching on correctly it should not hurt. The initial latch and first few sucks may hurt but once she is on properly there should be no pain. <br>  Its to be expected that they will be sore for a few weeks but its completely normal and using the creams and letting them air dry constantly will help.<br>  Ive been through this 3 times and the worst with my first but you just have to perservere.<br>  Also if you use bottles she will start to refuse the breast so ditch the bottles for now and concentrate on breastfeeding.You can lead to nipple confusion problems if you  don't stop giving bottles now. After 6-8 weeks you can start pumping and give the occasional bottle if you have to without it interfereing with your supply.<br>  <br>  Good luck and do try and perservere if you can tolerate it. It will get better i promise!!!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i pumped breast milk into bottles for my son from when he was 2wks till he was 6mths old. i used a hand pump from Avent and u can pump right in to the bottle. it is hard work tho, i would feed a bottle then had to pump a bottle for his next feed. i had 3 bottles in the fridge at all times. and warmed it by putting the bottle into a cup of hot water.<br>  u can express breast milk n freeze it for there months too.|`|46ijdaH6aa	Yes pumping would be good. I've had the same problems. I would not listen to the woman that said use formula. If your willing to breastfeed and your baby likes it than don't stop. An electric pump is great!!! Especially the double ones =]]|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Lots of women pump and give it to thier children. Yes, buy and electric one. They run about $300, but you need a good one. You need to get one quick, before your milk dries up.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	You can rent a hospital grade pump from the hospital or a pharmacy.  These will work best if you are planning on pumping full time.|`|AA11256693	If it hurts you probably aren't latched correctly. Although at 5 days your are probably a little bruised. You need to put your pinky in and break the seal, pull baby's chin down stuff a little more nipple in. The whole nipple and part of the aerola around should be in baby's mouth. Her/his ears should wiggle and there should be a pause before swallowing. If you hear a clicking, baby isn't on all the way and it will hurt.<br>  Electric pumps are the only way to go for daily, long term pumping, but trust me, the sore nipples will go away soon and everything will be fine. You will be SO glad you stuck it out.<br>  Call L&D and find out if there is a lactation specialist that can help. Look up videos online - there is tons of help out there.<br>  <br>  One more thing - a lot of people hold their breast the wrong way to start latch...think about the direction of the babies mouth...you want to gently pinch your breast the same direction, II instead of --I  if that sad visual makes any sense to you.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	of course you can... i do it when i am too sleepy, or if my baby wants to eat more after nursing.<br>  <br>  i have a manual pump, and it works just as good. i used the electric pump in the hospital. i don't see a difference at all, but i have a lot of milk and it is very easy to express it<br>  <br>  add<br>  don't give up on giving your baby breast milk. i think it is wonderful that you still want to give your baby your breast milk... who cares if it is through a bottle?!<br>  <br>  but if you want to keep trying to latch, nipple confusion can happen. use nipple cream, trust me it helps
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	If you are okay with gently used clothing, the first places you should try are freecycle.org, craigslist.com, consignment shops, thrift stores, and garage sales.<br>  <br>  If you want to buy new, TJ Maxx, Marshall's, and Ross's is pretty cheap (Gerber pack of 5 onsies are 5.99 there to give you an idea.)  K-mart is on the verge of going down, so they run clearance often.  I found a pack of 5 long sleeve onsies there for $4.  Target and Walmart are reasonably priced...a little more than the previous I listed, but you rarely have to pick/dig through to find deals.  (Always be sure to check their clearance section...target had a few onsies for a dollar a piece the other day when I went.)  And then there are the stores like Old Navy, JC Penny's, and Kohl's.  Reasonable in price, but definitely not the cheapest.<br>  <br>  As for the sizes, I have bought some onsies in each size.  Just incase he is on the larger side or if he grows out newborn size within the first couple of weeks.  2 or 3 gowns should be good to start.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Garage sales and Goodwill.  Babies grow so fast they don't have time to destroy their clothes like older kids.<br>  <br>  A few 0-3 and more 3-6.  Babies are pretty much guaranteed to grow.<br>  <br>  Put a baby wipe over his penis every time you change him to keep yourself from being anointed.  Mine squirted so often his big sister started referring to his penis as his squirter.  He never got me, but he did a couple of really nice large arcs on the wall next to the changing table.  Daddy was impressed!<br>  <br>  BTW, scented baby wipes are great at cleaning up spit stains and can save you a lot of clothes changes.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	Walmart is a great place for clothes. Certain walmarts are better than others. I just recently went to Sears and they had clothes on sale for 2.99. I got an outfit for 3 dollars. target is great for sleepers which you will need! They are the easiest to wear and to put on. My son is 7 months old and already wears  12 month clothes. So it wouldn't hurt to buy bigger clothes if you see a great deal. good luck And Congratulations!!|`|ME62Mtv4aa	those are pretty cheap and if you are not against hand me downs look for a good childrens consignment shop in your area those are a godsend. You can find gently used name brand items for like $1-$5 and with the way they go through things so quickly in the first year esp. you wont mind so much because you didn't pay alot and if the clothes are still in good condition they will prolly buy them back once he is too big for them. try this link www.childrensorchard.com|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Garage sales are your best friend. Also, I bet walmart and target would be pretty cheap, get the 5 packs of onsies, or at least the multiple packs, it saves money. Try Old Navy or oldnavy.com if there isn't one near you, they have crazy bargain clearance stuff all really cute. OH, and resale shops. There are two in my town, and they have single onsies that sold for around $17 in the store, and I bought them for $3.|`|sAbah6dTaa	ebay is awesome... target's clothes are about the same price as walmarts but i feel are much better quality.<br>  <br>  we also have a huge kids sale twice a year in my town, like over hundreds of families, definately worth looking into if you have one, or thrift stores, i love those!!|`|jcXsclHYaa	I would suggest you try eBay - lots of clothes to choose from and lots of great deals as well.|`|fUC4wCCEaa	My son lived in the sleepers and gowns for the first 3 months of life!  They are great.  <br>  Do buy onsies for all stages.  If you have a washer then you are set, I didn't at the time, so I bought a lot of clothes so I wouldn't have to be doing a load a day.  Trust me, one load a day is too much with a newborn!<br>  Yes, Target and Walmart are cheap.  I only buy diapers at Walmart because every time I look for clothes for my son they have nothing for boys but a whole side of the store for girls!  <br>  On line I would look at craigslist.  If you are in Chicago, I just posted sooooooo many clothes for free because I want them out of my house!  I was trying to sell them for 3 months now and am fed up!|`|SndrZbn8aa	Walmart is awesome for baby stuff. I usually prefer Target but found their selections a bit bare and overpriced comparatively. Babysupermall.com has some cheap clothes but they range from $5 - $22+. Toys-R-US had some great sales on baby clothes. Buy one get one etc. <br>  I've been told not to buy too many clothes before the baby arrives as the newborn clothes may only fit for a very short time if even at all. So with mine I've bought a couple newborn outfits and a couple of the 3-6mos just to be covered when she leaves the hospital and what not. Either way GL.|`|gQeGcwssaa	i don't know where you live, but if you live near a Children's Place Outlet Store, they pretty frequently have amazing sales. I have bought my niece jeans, dresses, shirts, shoes, everything for 5 dollars.|`|E9usXszgaa	If you don't mind use clothes Craigslist is the best it is so cheap all the clothes I bought for my son I bought use since they only use it for a little while|`|46ijdaH6aa	One word .. EBAY!! lol or Walmart =]]|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, babies r us is usually very reasonable, as well as secondhand shops, i would only buy nb and 0/3; we had 3/6 and she didn't fit them until the weather changed and didn't get to wear a lot of stuff she had.....she's petite and has always been on the small side, she's 8 mos and barely wears a size 2 diaper....she outgrew the size one in length .....she has a skinny bum....|`|SDjrojZXaa	if you have a gabriel brothers around you that is a wonderful place to get the cheapest clothes.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Thrift stores are perfect for things like diaper shirts (onsies) and sleepers, no one sees the onsies under their clothes anyway and babies never fit in clothes long enough to wears them out. In our thrift stores here you can get a whole bag of kids clothes for $1, why pay $5+ a piece for items you can get used for $0.10, and it's recycling. Another great thing to do is start attending a mom and baby or pregnancy support group, you're bond to meet someone with a baby boy who's a couple months older then yours will be and will be willing to pass down their clothes.<br>  <br>  Don't buy more then a couple of 0-3 months things, they only fit small babies for a few weeks and if you have a baby bigger then about 7 Lbs anything newborn sized wont fit.|`|5ZvALiclaa	EBAY!!! I bought bulk lots of clothes - like 40 pieces- for $13.50!!! all but 2-3 things are like brand new<br>  <br>  Get some of both sizes, i always stock up on the next few sizes as they grow fast and when you see things on sale or on the reduced items rack, buy up and put away for the next season! <br>  <br>  boys don't necessarily go through more clothes, just remember to point his willy DOWN when putting the nappy on otherwise the pee pee comes straight out the top of the nappy and onto their clothes!|`|jWBikTSjaa	Clearance racks.  Try Kohls too.  I don't think Target is necessarily the cheapest.  I wouldn't even bother with 0-3 months personally.  They are in 3-6 months so quickly, and then 6-9 months soon after that.  I think all my kids wore 6-9 months by the time they were 3 months old.<br>  <br>  Onesies, onesies, onesies!  Yes!  I never put the kids in the gowns, always sleepers.  And make sure you get the ones with snaps down the legs for the constant diaper changes.  It's tempting, but don't spend a lot on any individual item at this age.  They outgrow them so fast.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a Carter's Outlet near you, I'd check the clearance racks there.|`|u94HOVz7aa	craigslist is good if you dont mind second hand.  other than that walmart and target are so close in price its hard to say. walmart does have free shipping site to store if you wanna order online were target does not have that option.   and i dont know about changing a boy more than girls i have 2 girls and one boy and i changed my girlies more than i am having to my son.  i would buy 0-3 months mostly but get a few 3-6 as you dont know how fast your baby will be or grow.  i had a nephew that wore 3-6 month from birth.  he was a moose of a baby but a cutie.  my girlies wore 0-3 till almost 6 months.
AA10015577	You can do good at something when you set your mind to it.  You two WANT to keep the baby, it's your baby, so keep it.  Who cares what his parents think, they are only mad (if they get mad) for so long and I'm sure will come to support your guys' decisions.|`|vtFbGgTRaa	Tell both your parents they usually don't react as horribly as you might think they will.

8t8NjjnVaa	It's better to not take anything.  It won't cure your cold or your sinus infection, it will only relieve some symptoms temporarily.<br>  <br>  Since a cold remedy isn't going to cure you, why bother exposing your child to unnecessary medications?|`|EyKJ737daa	Oh you poor buggar! If the doctor has confirmed it as a sinus infection, then chances are they will give you something safe to take to help clear up the infection. Otherwise if there is nothing the doctor can give you, then you use vicks vapour rub.  Just rub it on your clothes under your chin so you get the vapours going up the help clear the nostrils.  You can also use a saline nasal spray, this will help tremendously in keeping it moist and not drying out.  Paracetamol can also be taken to ease pain.  Just every 4 hours as written on the label.  Paracetamol will not hurt your baby either while you are breastfeeding.  How old is your baby?  Is your baby still breastfed at night?  If your baby isn't feeding at night and only during the day, then i would suggest taking some ibuprofen tablets at night only so you can get some rest and help your body recover.  Although Ibuprofen will not hurt your baby, a small amount will still go through the breastmilk but as long as your baby is over 3 months then it'll be okay (Nurofen for infants is from 3 months and is Ibuprofen pain relief for babies), but just take it at night anyway so it's gone out of your system by morning when baby feeds next.  Good luck sweetie and hope you get better soon.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	For decongestants there's quite a bit you can do:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/cold-remedy.html#nasalsprays" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/cold...</a><br>  Nasal sprays or gels<br>  Nasal sprays are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. <br>  <br>  Of the preparations available for treatment of allergic symptoms, the nasal steroids (e.g., Flonase, NasalCrom) are considered to be, by far, some of the most effective and safest to use in breastfeeding moms. Although there is so far no data specifically on these intranasal steroids, it is known that the plasma levels of the drug are extremely low, and thus milk levels would be even lower. <br>  <br>  Nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline are probably not a problem, but oxymetazoline is long-acting and thus not the first choice for nursing mothers. A shorter acting alternative is phenylephrine.<br>  <br>  Zicam, a homeopathic nasal gel containing ionic zinc gluconate, is generally considered to be compatible with breastfeeding. Zicam contains small amounts of zinc (Zincum Gluconicum) - 266 micrograms per squirt; in one study (Mossad 2003) the daily dosage used was 2.1 mg per day. Zinc is considered compatible with breastfeeding, particularly in small amounts (excessive amounts are not a good idea, for mom's sake rather than baby's). In addition, nasal sprays/gels are generally a better choice for nursing moms as compared to oral medicines. The amount of systemic absorption of nasal sprays/gels is minimal compared to oral ingestion. Although not related to lactation, it should be noted that there are reports of loss of smell resulting from the use of intranasal zinc gluconate (see Jafek BW, Linschoten MR, Murrow BW. Anosmia after intranasal zinc gluconate use.

D., a renowned breastfeeding pharmacologist (Breastfeeding Pharmacology), notes that "breastfeeding mothers with poor or marginal milk production should be exceedingly cautious in using pseudoephedrine" and that "it is apparent that mothers in late-stage lactation may be more sensitive to pseudoephedrine and have greater loss in milk production" (Medications and Mother's Milk, 2006 edition).<br>  <br>  Dr. Hale is referring to this study: Aljazaf K, et. al. Pseudoephedrine: effects on milk production in women and estimation of infant exposure via breastmilk. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Jul;56(1):18-24.<br>  <br>  If you do take pseudoephedrine and notice a drop in milk supply (many moms do not, but research shows that it can decrease milk supply by as much as 24%), simply stop the medication and take measures to increase milk supply - the problem should resolve fairly quickly. <br>  <br>  Be very cautious about taking pseudoephedrine on a regular basis, as it has the potential to permanently decrease your milk supply. Regular use of pseudoephedrine (120 mg/day) has occasionally been used to decrease milk production in moms with overproduction, where the usual methods to regulate milk production were not working.<br>  <br>  Many meds have been reformulated so they no longer contain pseudoephedrine -- they're using phenylephrine instead.

I can't remember what the pharmacist said that I could take while breastfeeding but I know they said no to the Tylenol Cold medicine.

The safest thing to do is go to the pharmacy and ask what you can take, they will know what is safe and what isn't.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	First contact your doctor. But you should be able to take the medicine right after you breast feed, Take something like like tylenol. Tylenol was ok during pregnancy so it should be ok when you breast feed.

28WJwHf4aa	Every pregnant woman, regardless of age, is capable of breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is the best nutrition, but formula is also an option if you aren't comfortable doing so.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	You should TRY to breast feed and if that does not work (make sure you get a lactation specialist @ the hospital) then you can use formula.  Age has nothing to do with it, your body will produce breast milk regardless of what age you are.  My friend was 16 when she had her first child and successfully breast feed her until she was one.  Good luck with your new little one and your pregnancy!|`|QSodlfMraa	what do you age have to do with breastfeeding or formula?|`|nFj30sZcaa	There's no reason that you can not breast feed simply because of your age. (Think about years ago when women had children at much younger ages and formula wasn't an option!) <br>  It is a decision you have to make. I think that you should at least TRY to breastfeed before resulting to formula. There are so many benefits to breastfeeding rather than using formula.<br>  - It's virtually impossible for your baby to be allergic to your breastmilk.<br>  - Breastfed babies are smarter. (People will argue that, but in general it is true)<br>  - It's more convenient, always the right temp, etc.<br>  - Breastfed babies are less likely to get sick, get ear infections, and so on.<br>  The list could go on, but that's just a few examples.<br>  <br>  Obviously, I'm a breastfeeding advocate and believe that more women should be breastfeeding. But, it's totally up to you.<br>  Research the pros and cons of each and figure out what's best for you and your baby!<br>  Good luck, congrats.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Brestfeeding would be best for your baby, and you if you want to save time, money, and loose the baby weight faster<br>  <br>  <br>  BENEFITS FOR BABY:<br>  Health Risks of Not Breastfeeding<br>  Breast milk has agents (called antibodies) in it to help protect infants from bacteria and viruses. Recent studies show that babies who are not exclusively breastfed for 6 months are more likely to develop a wide range of infectious diseases including ear infections, diarrhea, respiratory illnesses and have more hospitalizations. Also, infants who are not breastfed have a 21% higher postneonatal infant mortality rate in the U.S. <br>  <br>  Some studies suggest that infants who are not breastfed have higher rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the first year of life, and higher rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, lymphoma, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, overweight and obesity, high cholesterol and asthma. More research in these areas is needed (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005).<br>  <br>  Babies who are not breastfed are sick more often and have more doctor's visits. <br>  <br>  Also, when you breastfeed, there are no bottles and nipples to sterilize. Unlike human milk straight from the breast, infant formula has a chance of being contaminated. <br>  <br>  Breast milk is the most complete form of nutrition for infants. A mother's milk has just the right amount of fat, sugar, water, and protein that is needed for a baby's growth and development. Most babies find it easier to digest breast milk than they do formula. <br>  <br>  As a result, breastfed infants grow exactly the way they should. They tend to gain less unnecessary weight and to be leaner. This may result in being less overweight later in life. <br>  <br>  Premature babies do better when breastfed compared to premature babies who are fed formula. <br>  <br>  Breastfed babies score slightly higher on IQ tests, especially babies who were born pre-maturely. <br>  <br>  BENEFITS FOR MOM:<br>  Nursing uses up extra calories, making it easier to lose the pounds of pregnancy. It also helps the uterus to get back to its original size and lessens any bleeding a woman may have after giving birth. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding, especially exclusive breastfeeding (no supplementing with formula), delays the return of normal ovulation and menstrual cycles. (However, you should still talk with your doctor or nurse about birth control choices.) <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, and possibly the risk of hip fractures and osteoporosis after menopause.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding makes your life easier. It saves time and money. You do not have to purchase, measure, and mix formula. There are no bottles to warm in the middle of the night! <br>  <br>  A mother can give her baby immediate satisfaction by providing her breast milk when her baby is hungry. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding requires a mother to take some quiet relaxed time for herself and her baby. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding can help a mother to bond with her baby. Physical contact is important to newborns and can help them feel more secure, warm and comforted. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding mothers may have increased self-confidence and feelings of closeness and bonding with their infants. <br>  <br>  BENEFITS FOR SOCIETY:<br>  Breastfeeding saves on health care costs. Total medical care costs for the nation are lower for fully breastfed infants than never-breastfed infants since breastfed infants typically need fewer sick care visits, prescriptions, and hospitalizations. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding contributes to a more productive workforce. Breastfeeding mothers miss less work, as their infants are sick less often. Employer medical costs also are lower and employee productivity is higher. <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is better for our environment because there is less trash and plastic waste compared to that produced by formula cans and bottle supplies.|`|2WtPKZvfaa	Its totally up to u, I was 17 and was breast feeding, its also cheaper then buying formula. Breast feeding is also very good for bub!<br>  Its what ever you feel comfortable with, Breast feeding is natural doesn't matter what age  you are!<br>  I'm still breast feeding my 17month old|`|vtFbGgTRaa	That is a personal decision regardless of your age. Think about it and make up your mind.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Breastfeeding is SO much easier.  It's also cheaper and more convenient.  Whipping out a breast at 2 am beats the heck out of mixing formula.  Special added bonus:  you don't have to worry about how many stupid ounces the baby is taking because you can't tell!<br>  <br>  What does your age have to do with it?  If your body's old enough to make a baby, it's old enough to make milk!  BTW, if you are going back to school right away, you can nurse mornings and evenings and the caregiver can give formula while you're in school.  It's perfectly possible as long as you are consistent about the times you are breastfeeding.  Your body will actually learn to produce milk at those times and not the rest of the time.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	You should definetly breastfeed, I'm 19 and plan on breastfeeding my son when he gets here in a couple months. I admit that it is awkward, especially when getting visits from friends and relatives, but it gives you your pre-pregnant shape back faster, gives you huge breasts, and if you don't get the milk out, the pain is going to feel like it is killing you. Plus babies who breastfeed are smarter and have less diseases and such.|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	You need to do what is best for you...whether that be breastfeeding or formula..many babies are happy and healthy that are formula fed and formula has many nutrients in it now that breastmilk has...but again its entirely up to you and how you feel about it...some will try to pressure you into breastfeeding but again its like peer pressure..you find whats best for you and work with it and never let anyone make you feel like a bad mom for your decisions...Good Luck|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I'm doing both.

If you're still in school, and want to breastfeed, you can pump so the baby has stuff during the day, but at the same time, you have to make sure you pump so that you don't stop lactating.  You can also give the baby formula.  Or you could do both.<br>  <br>  It's up to you, that has to be your decision!|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	If you want to breast feed than by all means do. If you are going back to school you can pump between classes and at lunch. Check out your local la leche league for support. If you are physically able to have a baby then you can breast feed. It will help you bond with your baby, get you back to your pre-pregnancy weight easier, decrease your child's risk of illness, decrease your risk of breast and ovarian cancer, studies show it can increase your baby's iq, the list goes on.

28WJwHf4aa	NO. You have to have sex in order to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend you start reading literature on the human body so you don't have to resort to asking such a ridiculous question on Y!A.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	She probably isn't pregnant, but just be very aware....prexxx is very, very potent and many are not aware of that !!!|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Honestly, there isn't a very high chance at all if no sperm came near her vagina. If that were the case, it would be impossible for her to be pregnant. Is she stressed out? Losing weight? Taking any antibiotics? Eating poorly? A number of things could be prolonging her period, not just a pregnancy. But even then, she's only a day or two late, so no need to worry. If she goes a week without a period, then buy her a pregnancy test. Good luck.|`|oem5yEUDaa	She is only one day late so there is not really any need to worry, especially since you say there was no sperm vagina contact. Maybe she has miscalculated her cycle. Stress and weight loss can also delay or even stop periods as well.|`|JBsilBYXaa	No change.  It is normal for a period to be late everynow and then.  Just make sure she is relaxed because stress can prevent a period from starting.|`|AA10526033	no sex=no baby. being a day or two late is nothing.|`|dc05acb14cd8ef4d0acc29a54b8d9584aa	did you do anything *before* valentine's day?  if not it's unlikely she's pregnant.  there's 2 weeks (usually) between ovulation and period and you guys messed around right in the middle of that.<br>  <br>  sure, give me a thumbs down for being honest.  I don't care.  I know everyone here is so fond of telling silly teenagers that they can get pregnant all month long just to freak them out, but that's stupid.<br>  <br>  there is virtually no way for her to get pregnant one week before her period is due, especially if they didn't have intercourse.  she probably wouldn't even get pregnant if their hands were covered in semen before they touched her.|`|WDfktpvwaa	You don't have to have sex to get pregnant although it is very difficult to get pregnant, PERIOD!! If she is only one day late I would not worry about it right now, wait a week and if she is still late take a pregnancy test. There are tons and tons of reasons why she could be late and pregnancy is just one of them. Next time be careful because if your not ready to take care of a baby, you should definitely not be doing the things you guys are! Babies are a lot of work, well worth it, but a lot of work!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I don't think you should be worrying at all.It sounds like you are both young, and when a girl is young her periods are usually irregular. And stressing herself can amke it even later. Don't worry about it, I would bet lots of money (if I had it) on her not being pregnant.|`|l6FtTxlwaa	yeah u have to have sex to get pregnant lol|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Sound to me like you are needlessly worrying but take a test to be sure|`|2RInFX4Qaa	Don't Worry The Female Body is a werid place..Maybe she just stressed or something|`|rOa2efDlaa	it's very hard to tell at this point. of course there's a chance, but you could also be worrying about nothing.<br>  <br>  unfortunetly, ocne a girl thinks she may be pregnant, she starts stressing, and that could delay her period even longer. you should assure her that everything is okay, and give it another week or two (there are scares that go even longer than that) before you should become concerned. <br>  <br>  should it arise, taking a test isnt a bad idea either...you could  even get her a morning after pill, just to put her mind at ease...good luck with everything

If the color turns yellow, green, or brown it could indicate that you have some sort of an infection.

8j7zj9aKaa	To answer the question I would need a better idea of your age, of your friends age and gender, and of your friends relationship with your parents.<br>  <br>  If you are a 14 year old girl, and you want to bring a 19 year old guy that your parents are not comfortable with- I think you are fighting a lost battle.<br>  <br>  If you are a 14 year old girl, and you want to bring your 14 year old best friend who your parents have known for years - that is more plausible.<br>  <br>  Things that make parents say no:<br>  - difference in genders (hanky panky)<br>  - the other person being older than you<br>  - difference in ages<br>  - your parents not knowing or not liking the person<br>  <br>  Things to make parents more likely to say yes:<br>  - same gender <br>  - close in age<br>  - parents know person for a long time<br>  - parents like the person<br>  <br>  Thats my two cents.<br>  EDIT:<br>  Seeing how that is met:<br>  - how do your parents feel about your friends?<br>  - the other posters have valid points about - what if your parents want this to be family only?  What about the legal liability your parents would be taking on?<br>  <br>  Your parents might be missing you, and wanting to make a few memories before you move away to college, and make some major steps out of their lives.  Your bringing your friend could be contrived as putting a wet-blanket on those hopes if you plan to spend more time with her than them, or if her presence would cause you to not be real or open with your parents.  <br>  <br>  You need to understand what their hopes are for the vacation.  Given that you need to evaluate whether having your friends along is going to disappoint those hopes, or not.  If your parents think, or plausibly believe, that having your friend along is going to help the hopes- they might be more amenable.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Its a FAMILY vacation, your parents want to see you, not have you out of their hair.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	How are their passports?<br>  <br>  Also its a huge safety/responsibility issue you are asking your parents to take on.

I rode almost every day of EACH of my pregnancies.  <br>  <br>  so let me guess,  you people stop everything when you are pregnant, right?  people get in car accidents while pregnant,  or hit by one crossing the street.    there are all kinds of activities that "could" harm the baby.  you can't stop everything.<br>  <br>  We live on a ranch and rely on horses everyday to help us do our work.  I had healthy babies.(4)  --  3 of them were right on time the other was a week late. -- and I think that was a case of bad math....<br>  <br>   Actually, I believe riding kept me in shape while pregnant, I had easy deliveries too!  <br>  <br>  If you are used to riding I say GO FOR IT.....   Oh,  and next time don't ask a bunch of no nothings for advice.|`|qga7GDPNaa	No, it's not recommended that you do. First off, if you fell off it would be pretty bad.

It's best for you and your baby right now.|`|dKq7DZkbaa	Yeah sure if you want to go into pre-term labor.

With that being said, if you don't take it easy you could go into pre-term labor and wouldn't you be afraid of the possibility of an accident? Let me ask you this. Can you take a newborn baby and put him in a carrier on your back and ride a horse? Sure you can - but you'd be crazy to and you would also be crazy to attempt something with alot of potential for an accident which could cause pregnancy loss in a very tramatic and painful way for you.|`|QTWGaT6gaa	No because a fall would be bad for you even though if the horse was just walking you'd be fine but you never know when they are gonna step in ants and buck you off. *happened to me Well- is it your horse?

Some cute ideas she had were:<br>  <br>  Every girl dressed up like a different Disney princess in play clothing.  <br>  <br>  Using a dowel rod and ribbons, the children made ribbon wands by tying on the ribbons (then you could hot glue around them to make sure they stay in place) and later were able to dance around with them.<br>  <br>  She added pink glitter to play dough, and the kids were able to play with the "Royal Playdough."  <br>  <br>  She had a princess cutout, and had place the tiara on the princess.<br>  <br>  The girls also made jewel goblets.  She bought plastic goblets and let the kids glue on little jewels to decorate their own goblet to take home...<br>  <br>  As party favors she bought little trinket boxes and put play jewelry in them and candy bracelets and necklaces.<br>  <br>  ...IDK--maybe some of the things could be adjusted for your little girl.  :)  I also know that you can always find books at the library full of birthday activity ideas.  <br>  Good luck!<br>  && Happy first birthday to your little girl!! :)  HOW EXCITING!|`|lc9nus8taa	if shes turning one i don't think you really need a party (except with family) but if you mean her first party like if shes turning 5 tell all her friends they can dress up as princesses have pink,blue and purple balloons and a pink spongecake. play party games like hide 'n' seek etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh theres usually places for little girl parties not disney princess but like princess dresses,fairy outfits,mermaid outfits etc. (and pirate and superhero outfits for boys) there really fun for little girls if shes turning 5<br>  <br>   i remember my 5th birthday i dressed up as snow white  she was my favourite lol|`|sAbah6dTaa	i wouldn't go all out, just a big cake and small one for her, mostly family and a few close friends because she isn't going to care that much and you will end up opening all of her presents for her. <br>  <br>  my advice just keep it small. and take lots of pictures.|`|ch66f4w1aa	Is it just the first party or is she 1 year old?<br>  <br>  Semantics i know sorry :)  Er if she is 1 then anything really..old enough to enjoy things but anything fancy will be lost on them totally.|`|WuWVEcwEaa	I took my daughter to a little girls birthday party, and they had princess dresses for all the little girls to put on, they had tiaras for all the little girls.

XnmFz3Pqaa	There is always a chance, even when you are on birth control...but that chance is slim!!!  I very seriously doubt you are already pregnant as you WERE STILL on the pill when you had sex and you are having your period now....not to mention he does pull out.  As all dr say bc is not 100 percent....and you can still have your period while pregnant, and pulling out isn't 100 percent either because of the pre *** ....it doesn't happen often...especially not both or all three circumstances combined.  Ive heard of ppl being on bc and getting pregnant.  And I've heard of ppl having a lighter period than usual when they first get prego...and I know you can but have not experienced a person getting prego by pre ***....but I've never heard of a person on bc..getting pregnant by just pre *** and still having a period.  I know you are probably just worried but I do believe all these circumstances combined and you turning out prego would be far fetched.  So just take a deep breathe and relaxe..I really don't think you are prego!!  And...since it was last week that you had the unprotected sex that would mean you had probably already ovulated for this month...which is another reason why you are not currently prego.  <br>  <br>  As far as you missing your one day, yes, that does increase your chances of getting pregnant...AFTER THIS MENSTRAUL...so use extra precaution this month. Either way, if you really want to be 100 percent in the future...stay on bc but use extra protection.|`|2GXgT981aa	The pill has already prevented ovulation for your last cycle (the one where you had unprotected sex), so no, you can't get pregnant from that.  What you need to worry about is this cycle, because you're starting it late.  You might want to use condoms for this month just to be sure.  It's unlikely, but it's ALWAYS better safe than sorry when it comes to birth control.|`|1lfgh3KPaa	This is thee most shocking and perverted thing I have heard in all my life especially the way in which you described how it happened.

Just be more careful next time. If you're really worried about becoming pregnant, use a back up birth control method, such as a condom, for the rest of the month since you were late taking your first pill. Remember, the pill is not 100% effective even when taken PERFECTLY. So taking a pill late can make it less effective.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Usually if you miss one pill, you're okay. However, if you miss two pills you need to use back-up protection for a week. Otherwise, you could get pregnant. There are women that have gotten pregnant on the pill, so it's always wise to use back-up protection at all times. The pill is only 97% effective when taken correctly. =) I never had any problems with mine, though.

It will also save you the decision of having to make a choice between keeping a child you can not afford, adoption or abortion. Also you do not ovulate till day 14 of your MP meaning 14 days after the day you start your MP.|`|dH9IhDIFaa	There is always a very slight chance of pregnancy when on birth control.  You would have had the effects of the birth control in your system at the time of unprotected sex so I would not worry about it unless you miss your period.|`|sAbah6dTaa	honey you can always get pregnant no matter what, my sister in law got pregnant with all three of her kids on different types of birth control, that's why you should always have a back up!|`|AA10526033	could still get prego using bc pills but since you are on your period and sugar pills i would say your not and its okay to miss sugar pills
KlKomVgPaa	yes you have a really good chance if everything is normal for both of you ..Wish you all luck and baby dust
17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Can you get a full time job? Can you drive? Can you graduate highschool? Can you buy or rent your own place? If you answer no to one or more of these questions then your too young|`|XYOYml59aa	yes<br>  At 14 you can't afford it<br>  aren't old enough yourself to teach your child everything they should know<br>  you lack maturity (seen by either getting pregnant at that age or by the fact you can't see that you shouldn't)<br>  Your child might catch up to you in schooling <br>  Its a bad example to your child<br>  Your body isn't ready to handle having a baby.<br>  <br>  Tons more reasons but if this isn't enough to show you why, nothing will be anyway|`|HbQmDGb6aa	Physically, no. But it's physically more dangerous than a fully developed woman. <br>  Financially? Almost without exception, a 14 year old is not going to be able to support a child alone. Wage and child labor laws are the primary reason.<br>  Emotionally? Much too young. No matter how mature a 14 year old thinks she is, she's not. The (arguably) most emotionally developmental years are still to come in high school and college. Some 14 yr olds may be farther along than others, but virtually all of them lack the life experience to truly be ready. <br>  A child at 14 would significantly interrupt the mother's life. Even if she put the baby up for adoption, the criticism and stigma she would endure during her pregnancy would have severe negative impacts on her psycological development. Raising the child herself would be nearly impossible to do successfully and still have time to achieve even a little substantial growth in her own life.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Definitely!!!<br>  You should not even be having sex.<br>  <br>  To bring a child into the world would be highly irresponsible.  You know nothing about parenting and you are still just a kid yourself.  How would you provide for the kid or take care of it??  You have no income and you are in school all day so you wouldn't be able to watch it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Think about having kids some day and what you will name them, etc.  But some day is not today.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	On purpose, yes. But accidental pregnancies happen in girls that young and they can still be good parents. If you aren't pregnant, don't get pregnant on purpose. There's plenty of time to have kids later.|`|5FEVLTufaa	You are probably asking this because either you think you might be pregnant or your are just wondering....<br>  <br>  either way, yea 14 is too young...|`|86VgnUmQaa	too young! maybe in about 6 years. or 8.|`|sNqi1fLPaa	It is young honey. But its not impossible. I had my child at 17 and im 26 now and me and my girl are ok. And guess what, you dont remain young forever so you wont always be a young mom. Its very challenging, but I would not be who and where I am today if it were not for my baby girl. Good luck to you.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	yes. You have a lot of years to be able to have babies, why do it now and miss out on the rest of your childhood? Because YES, you are a child. Children do not need to be having babies, it's not a toy.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	i am 14 and i think if anyone has a child that early they are throwing the best years of life away. Why skip 10 years of your life to take care of a child. You just need to fight the urge.|`|lc9nus8taa	ofcourse it is your not gonna be able to have fun like kids should.<br>  <br>  honestly wait till your atleast 27 to have a kid<br>  <br>  its also to young for sex you should be 18 for that|`|XqqLlBe4aa	well hmmmm<br>  what the F**K do YOU think!?<br>  you bug me.|`|ITu6gONdaa	lol of course...bad bad idea|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	yeah if your live in canada or usa it is|`|AOtnoozdaa	YES! Your still a kid yourself whether you think you are or not.  Your future hasn't happened yet, frankly mine hasn't and I'm almost 24.  <br>  <br>  You maybe content with having a kid now, but you'll become less happy as you get older.  Especially when YOUR kid wants to have a kid when they're 14 seeing you had one at that age.  Then you'll have the burden of raising two kids practically.  Your setting yourself up for a stressful future.  Get YOUR life together before you even think about trying to organize someone elses life i.e. the baby's.  Don't have a baby for attention, they're not objects, they're people.  <br>  <br>  Remember, think about the sacrifices your parents made for you when you were an infant, I'm sure it wasn't easy.  Then think about this.  Is the father of the baby going to stick around?  You need to have a fit father.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	In my own opinion? Yes i think 14 is too young. I think you should wait till your married to have a baby and make sure its with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. Same with sex, i would wait till its with the person you want to spend your life with. If you are 14 and pregnant i would get some help from your mom and she can help you through this.|`|3X8Igzhxaa	if you want to ruin your life yeah don't let your ego get the better of you people only have kids so they can boost there own egos the world is better off without unwanted children running around and believe me once you've not had any sleep for months on end your kid will become unwanted|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Well first off it's illegal.<br>  Second off, you have to at least be 15 or 16 to get a job in most places.  That means a 14 year old most likely couldn't support a baby.  <br>  So I'm going to have to say yes, 14 is too young to have sex and end up pregnant.|`|C8pFxLDYaa	Its too hard to take care of a kid at that age. Too stressful, limits you to do fun things, you won't get child support unless the guy is 18.<br>  <br>  Fasten your condom|`|pHvpRbrkaa	i would have to say yes,  you still have school and how would you have income.. most 14 years old have a hard time getting a job... goodness your still a child if your 14|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Im 13 and I have a son. So no your good. HELLO WAKE UP GIRL FRIEND!!!!!!!! YOU ANSWER YOUR SELF THAT AND THINK IF YOUR TOO YOUNG FOR A BABY. OMG GET A LIFE BARBIE DOLL|`|0oBaC5s9aa	Are you joking?<br>  What fourteen year old is willing to give up there teenage years being a parent?<br>  And what fourteen year old can even AFFORD to have a kid.<br>  Pathetic...|`|0w8EmVjTaa	Yes! Being a minor makes your life miserable when you have a child. Jobs are impossible for a 14 year old|`|pkNtAjXoaa	yes it is way to young to be even thinking about it. wait untill atleast 18 or up.|`|9RtdvLEKaa	Yes, but if you're 14 and pregnant, that is no reason to have an abortion.|`|abLF20Nuaa	Are you mad? Of course it is!! I mean, it might SEEM exciting, but it's gonna be one dangerous of life-threatening choice.|`|29BrE6tJaa	ABORT ABORT ABORT!!!!! KILL THE BABY! AND HAVE AN ABORTION!!!!|`|siUw9Fzlaa	Uhm, duhh?|`|KtlHpp3saa	yes it is|`|q6w8wnX2aa	yeah
xVbUwhZoaa	If you're trying to get pregnant why is he only finishing in you once in a while?<br>  <br>  You should be trying every day. And if you finished in you 3 weeks ago and a test came back negative, then no you're 99% not pregnant.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	wait 9 months|`|7jdvcrTKaa	It could have been that you took the test too early.  The best thing to do is to track when you are ovulating.  You can do that by taking a First Response Ovulation Kit Test and keeping track of your body basal temperature.  I am in the same boat with you by doing the waiting game myself so good luck and LOTS of baby dust, LOL!|`|9Gsx32Skaa	its hard to say. not all cases go this way but generally ovulation is about the 14th day from the first day of your last period. you may have to try again
7YoOBGMMaa	Yes, that's normal.  Even if you were still breastfeeding, BM habits can change after 6 weeks.  Formula is definitely more constipating because of the iron content.  But if your baby is still pooping regularly, and they're relatively loose (or pasty), not formed poop, and she's not straining, I'd say she's doing just fine!<br>  <br>  Since the switch was just this week, I'd watch to make sure she doesn't start displaying any signs of constipation (strained/grunting, having formed poop or very little).  The poop will probably darken in color and smell worse than when she was on breastmilk, but that's normal.|`|u94HOVz7aa	thats normal formula fed babies tend to poo less often i have found from experience.|`|AA10526033	thats normal.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	This is very normal. I got nervous when my son went from 8 bowel movements a day to only one every other day. The doctor said that this is comepletely normal. I mean he went 9 months with going so i guess it has to come out.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Anything from 3 times a day to once every three days.
AoF6qxV9aa	don't worry one bit there is an average that most babies first tooth is the bottom central incisor but that first tooth can come in any spot, some kids even get their "fangs" in first, it makes for interesting "little vampire" smiles but even that is normal. Heck they say the avg. age for the start of teething is 5-6 mos old and my son got his first tooth at 3 mos old!|`|yDWcYXl5aa	My son's did this, and he's fine.  Every child is different my son's doctor says.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	No I would worry about it, every baby is different. My son got 1 bottom tooth and then a week later 1 top tooth and then the other on top 4 days later. And supposedly they are supposed to get both bottom ones first. You baby is fine, he/she is just getting his/her teeth the way they want to. Hope this helps.
XRMNQPUIaa	yes, you are pregnant. 2 pts ftw|`|7jdvcrTKaa	Well, its possible that you are but it could also be that you are experiencing PMS.  I know the older I get, the different symptoms I get when it's almost that time of the month.  Sometimes that get so bad to the point that I think that I might actually be pregnant that month until that dreaded AF (Aunt Flow) comes around the corner. Anyway, if you take a test and it comes out negative and the symptoms don't go away, go to the doctor or Planned Parenthood for a blood test.  Hope that was helpful and keep us posted.|`|VCwTM7sGaa	ask your self why did i have sex? i mean if u knew the riskes. i mean really if u knew the risks.. like you even KNEW all the riskes. EVERY risk. and u still had sex. I MEAN the RISKS!! i mean just think  about the risks. you could have a baby becuase you took the risk. i mean the risk was risky. but sex is tempting so dont that risky risk. haha im jkns i have no ******* idea if ur pregnaut or not im here to sound like a father even tho im only 15. im just screwing with u. this answer is complete bs. so  have fun reading about this risk taking risky story of risks.|`|vlCtpi5Oaa	Have you missed a period yet?  I would suggest taking a pregnancy test. If not, some of them are capable of testing up to 3 or 4 days before missed period.  Breast tenderness is also a common symptom of pregnancy, along with frequent urination.|`|07i0Xyevaa	you could be dont stress. this could be from stress too. U should  go to google.com and type in pregnancy quizzes and take one.<br>  <br>  but for now worry about getting a pregnancy test if comes up negative then get a blood test from ur doctor
f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yes if u dont get ur period|`|N4nYw5B8aa	Your most fertile time is approximately 15 days from the start of your last period.|`|ksya426Uaa	omg. this happened to me too. but i had my period. <br>  did you find out?
Og09Q7ylaa	Tell her you will support her no matter what she decides to do. Don't be judgmental; be there to listen.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	where do you get off being dissapointed in her?  Passing judgement, you're the kind of friend she doesn't need|`|qQJdi0p1aa	just be there for her...shes going to need you now more than ever!!|`|vhtqsfALaa	she will be frightened and confused if she is a good friend then lend her your shoulder and give her the best advice you can tell her the best thing to do is tell her parents it will probably be the hardest thing for her to do but reassure her you are there for her if she knows she has someone to lean on she will feel a little better good luck to ya both|`|KpeyqmWhaa	im 16 now<br>  and i have a beautiful son<br>  it really doesn't matter what age you are<br>  just tell her you will be there for her<br>  because when i found out i was prego(15)<br>  all my friends left except one<br>  and that made me realize i only had one real friend<br>  so be a real friend and be there for her<br>  this is when she needs you most
8yTP3jO8aa	You could pack your own.
igkCwSpuaa	there is sperm in his stuff that comes out before his actual come, though it is only a small amount, it only takes one of those little buggers to get you preg. Use a condom next time or other birth control to be safer.|`|KpeyqmWhaa	Yes<br>  because even though he didn't ejaculate<br>  there still pre-sperm that comes out<br>  &&that can and will get you pregnant.|`|p0prrzf2aa	uh yea..it's called precum and you most deff can get pregnant by it|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	my friend has got preggo 4 times this way  i thought she was stupied to believed it works  guess she wasnt the only one|`|S9jyc95jaa	Yes, you still could be if you didn't use any other kind of protection (like birth control pills).  Pulling out is not the most reliable method of contraception... the failure rate is roughly around 25%.  You should definitely use a condom next time.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Any time there are sexual organs not protected by condoms, or the pill, and you use the above method, pregnancy can, and often does occur.  Pre *** has active sperm in it too.|`|alJA3jyCaa	Of course you can get pregnant like that, or maybe just a little pregnant|`|RzYePezkaa	yes it only takes 1 swimmer to get pregnant.|`|h1AIzD9baa	if your not on birth control or dont use a condom.. go ahead and plan on getting pregnant if you are going to rely on the "in and out" method..  "only cumming a little bit" "didn't go all the way in"   common sense please.. that even sounds wrong!!  precum or nutted all in ya.. its the same.. and its possible..|`|JJZi7r6maa	There may be be a possibility. If this happened within the last 24-48 hours you can go to Plan Parent Hood and get the morning after pill.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	You can, however I wouldn't be very concerened at the moment. But for future even if it's just in and out you still want to use condoms.|`|07b451c57b519f0c6b496320de3d2deeaa	Yes you can get PREGNANT from that. You should go get a pregnancy test if your period is late.|`|NMzlbWt8aa	yes, you can still get pregnant.  Quit being stupid and start using protection|`|gT31DB1caa	YES!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	yep, I have a 2 year old from doing that. You better go get a job...|`|WT5tYLdfaa	he didnt go in? how in the world.... no youre not pregnant
n2O0NwR6aa	My kids both got cell phones when they started middle school (7th grade), and that was age 12.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Ummm i got mine when I was 11,really close to 12.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	mine dont have them yet, they aren't even 5 months old yet lol...<br>  <br>  But i got my first one when i entered high school, so i was 13 but i had to share it with my siblings lol...<br>  I got my OWN for my 14th birthday..|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	My children are not old enough for cellphones but I have a little sister who is 16 years younger then me. I have been like a mother to her most of her life and I recently got her a cellphone, she is an extremely mature 11 year-old. Because she is mature I think it's a good age for her but I don't think I would give just any 11 year-old a cellphone, really i'd feel uncomfortable giving most 16 year-old's a cellphone.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	When our 16 yr olds were 14, almost 15 they bought them with their own money from their own jobs and they buy their own minutes when they need them.  Our 9 yr old son will  buy his own too when he earns the money at that age.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	When he was 16 and driving a car.

Iu0AJDviaa	You may find that your baby has started teething. although teeth may not show up for mths they go through the red cheeks,dribbling and sometimes irritation.<br>  When they do go through this their poo turns really acidic,so im thinking their saliva would too.<br>  Did your doctor mention anything to give her?May be a baby antacid might help.<br>  Good luck.|`|bql2RJzWaa	It cold be as simple as a heat rash. Apperently they get '6 week acne'...If it doesn't disappear with in a week, get it checked.|`|KihffCc5aa	It could also be hereditary.  Both of my children, from newborn to early elementary school get very rosy RED cheeks, so much so that preschool teachers insisted my children were feverish, when they weren't!  They just always had red cheeks!<br>  <br>  If it's not hereditary, try vaseline on the cheeks a couple times per day, to shy off dry skin, tis the season for dry skin, especially for caucasions exposed to weather.<br>  <br>  You can put vaseline on her red cheeks, and if she has a red rash around her neck due to excess saliva, try a wee bit of hydrocorsone.<br>  <br>  My babies have had redness in their cheeks forever, it's their heritage.  But, when it was dry skin, that was it, Vaseline fixed it.  Likewise a combination for the diaper of desitine and yeast medication, in a combo for the diaper rash.<br>  <br>  Don't freak out with red cheeks on your child!  I've gone through all heck with people, teachers, more, assuming my children were fevered, etc.!  They nauturally blush RED cheeks!<br>  <br>  Colleen|`|JXQKzl2xaa	My daughter has this too pretty much since she has been born and she is 10 months now. One cheek will be redder than the other as well. I talked to the doctor about it and she said that it's dry skin. To help it she said to put a good lotion on it, as long as it was for sensitive skin. She said to put it on in the morning, afternoon, and before bed. Also anytime before and after she goes outside. I hope that helps some.|`|AoF6qxV9aa	My son has redness in his cheeks too, it's almost like chapped skin but he gets it regardless of being in wind or not, my Dr. says it is kind of like eczema she told us to try cetaphil or aquaphor ointment, also hydracortizone cream works wonders on baby skin and is totally safe.|`|JJZi7r6maa	My niece got the same thing. With time it seemed to decrease. If you baby seems to be spitting up a lot you may want to consider changing formula, if you aren't breastfeeding.
b26Dp8LKaa	Click on this link for information about what is necessary to adopt in Tennessee:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/state/index.cfm?event=stateStatutes.processSearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/l...</a><br>  <br>  Once the adoption is finalized, your son will receive an amended birth certificate showing your name as his father and his mother's name (of course).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  ETA: All due respect to my dear friend, Elizabeth; that's like saying "it's only a ring" or "it's just a piece of paper" in reference to marriage. That may be true for some marriages. If it's just a piece of paper, than so is an OBC. As an adoptee, I'd love to have a copy of my OWN OBC (original birth certificate)!<br>  <br>  It takes more than a piece of paper to make a father. I'm a firm supporter of father's rights. But I accept the facts provided here @ face value. Every child wants 2 parents.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	But what does the child want.<br>  This child won't be young forever.<br>  Putting your name on a birth certificate to say you gave birth to a child that you didn't is false. It's wrong.<br>  The child needs to know the truth - not a bunch of lies to make you all feel better.<br>  No matter what that truth is.<br>  We all deserve to know out truth.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	There's a law called the putative father registry in many states that if a father doesn't sign up that he is the father, in writing at the clerk's office, and starts making an effort to be a father, i.e. support, visitation, etc, then the child can be adopted out.  Many attorneys don't even know this law.  Our state has 10 days where the father has to sign up on the registry or he has no rights, although it doesn't relieve him of his obligations.  If she's ever applied for any type of government aid, there might have already been a type of search done that may qualify as sufficient to absolve any parental rights on the bio dad's part.<br>  <br>  You should be able to get a free consultation from someone who does adoption in your state.  Find out from them what you need to do to make the adoption happen.  Will you need a home study?  Will you have to advertise to make this happen?  etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	don't listen to the jerk above me. My hubby wants to adopt my son too! You would probably have to petition the court for adoption, even though it says father unknown.<br>  <br>  My son's real dad is on his birth certificate so I have to ask him if it would be okay for my hubby to adopt, then we can start the process. He would have to go in front of a judge, give up his rights, and then we can start legal adoption. All record of the real dad would be erased and my son would be issued a new birth certificate. I wish you the best!|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Whilst is admirable that you are willing to raise another man's child, putting your name on his birth certificate (a document that is supposed to  record factual vital information) would be a lie.  Why on earth would you want to falsify a legal document intentionally.<br>  <br>  You can be a father figure in the child's life without falsifying his birth record.|`|AA12174100	sorry, but you cannot just add your name on the bc. Once you are married for a year or two, go see a lawyer and its a pretty easy process.|`|1ZIWC8iWaa	I think it would be great if you adopted the child because then he would have a legally known father and would not really feel so insecure when he grows up because his father's name is not unknown in his birth certificate but your name is there instead. Good luck!|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Had I raised my son instead of being coerced into surrendering I would have liked my husband to adopt him so I am.  In the UK a social worker can explain how to go about this or a family law solicitor can.
N4GreuqEaa	call and say u wan blood test.. or go to diff doctor.|`|JJZi7r6maa	Go in there and tell your dr if she refuses to do the test you will find some other doctor to do the test for you so either way it will be done.|`|nXjPp8L1aa	I would call them and tell them that you want a blood test done if they still refuse then call another doctor ad talk to them about it. Another  thing I would also like to say is I know you say you have all these syptoms and you beleive your pregnant but your test is showing negative it could be many other things causing you to fell this way. I have missed my period also and I have had all the pregnancy syptoms and I "thought" I knew I was pregnant again I done test and come to find out im not im having trouble with my blood sugar which causes you to miss period and many other pregnancy symptoms....Maybe I would check that out also..|`|vlCtpi5Oaa	Go to a different doctor. Or, if you can't find one who has an opening, go to the Emergency Room.  While the doctor would be cheaper, most ER's do blood tests if the patient thinks they are pregnant.  However, I would not suggest going unless this is completely the last alternative because it is a great deal more expensive than a dr visit, especially if there is no health insurance. Not to mention, it ties up drs and nurses when they may be needed for an emergency. Good Luck!|`|kP3Ryfyuaa	usually they tell you to wait two weeks ans if you still havent gotten your period to come back for another urine test. And then if that is positive they will do a blood test. Thats what my doctor said. But I have had friends that just asked for a blood test and got it. Mine wont give it to me without a pos urine test. Try a different doc. Call around and see what places take your insurance.
g6sCUoO7aa	If you have a 28 day cycle, and your LMP started on 27/01, you should be due for your period today (Monday), it sounds like PMS symptoms.|`|7jdvcrTKaa	There's a slight chance but it could also just be PMS.  It takes more than one symptom and a missed period to say that you are preggers.|`|CNM30VmLaa	not likely.|`|i3t1BhNmaa	U need to be more specific. If we assume u hav a regular 28 day cycle, then ur next MP should occur around 24th Feb and u were probably very fertile between 8th - 12th feb. Yes, there could be a chance of pregnancy and sm ppl can feel it as early as after 2 weeks of conception. But u'l not b able to test it at home though. (HPT) 'cos ur HCG levels are probably still low. Best is go to a doc explain da situation and if it's recommended get a blood test or if u can wait another couple of days more..

You do need to see a doctor so go to a clinic or your doctor they will help you with telling your parents. You have several options to consider and the sooner you start the better. If an abortion is what you want now is the time if your going to have the baby then you need to start good medical care( being a pregnant teenager is hard on you and the baby) if adoption is best then you will need to start talking to agencies. Good luck and God bless.|`|51ZckvKIaa	Tell the truth and have a plan.<br>  <br>  Your parents will be shocked, disappointed.  Let them know that though this was not what you were planning, you have a plan for having a baby, taking a break from school, finishing school later, getting a job.  You can take some distance education courses to finish school.<br>  <br>  You need their support, so let them know that you are scared and need them now more than ever.<br>  <br>  Good luck, honey.  All the best to you and your new baby.|`|dXEo2xpqaa	Wow, I'm sorry. That kinda sucks. Try and stay positive about it. NO suicide! (:<br>  Sit your parents' down, explain to them that you have needs, and that you aren't a virgin. Talk about that for a few minutes. Explain to them that they can feel mad and be angry, too.<br>  <br>  Then, let them express their own emotions for a little bit. Before breaking the news to them, mention that you want their support and help through everything. Then, explain that you took some tests after you had sex, because you stopped having your period. Then, say "Mom, Dad.. I'm going to be a mother. I'm so sorry. Please help me and support me. I need you know more than ever." <br>  <br>  I would suggest you and your boyfriend taking some parenting classes and such. And try to stay together with your boyfriend. Only have an abortion if you feel you need to, or you feel you won't be a good parent to your son/daughter. Keep in your head that young adults/teens/children risk dieing with pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Good wishes!<br>  God bless!<br>  ?????|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	how cliche,<br>  <br>  best thing to do is be straight up with them <br>  <br>  may be easier to let both of them know at the same time.<br>  <br>  dont try to hide anything or cover anything up that will just make matters worse.<br>  <br>  and word of advice,<br>  <br>  dont continually regret your mistake, dont wish you hadnt dont something,<br>  <br>  just keep thinking positive like, what will you do in the future etc.<br>  <br>  you dont want to feel bad of course you should learn from you mistakes but try to better the situation best as you can.<br>  <br>  hope if you are pregenant that you raise a good healthy baby.<br>  <br>  good luck. hope i helped.|`|FOjurlZZaa	you know, most ppl are gonna say its the end of your life and blah blah blah.<br>  but okay to be honest i think you need to think about this a little.<br>  i understand that you are really really young, and yea okay, but that part we cant change. this has already happened so lets move on from that.<br>  okay so your pregnanat, you first need to realize it yourself and figure out how you feel.<br>  once you've done that and you and your boyfriend both know, then you should tell both your parents. just be calm about it. i'm not saying it will be easy, but whats done is done so you might as well get them to understand.<br>  after that, your parents can help you make a decision, just make sure you've thought about what you want as well as what they tell you.<br>  look into things for yourself and consider all possible outcomes of every possible choice.<br>  you should tell your parents, there isn't any way to hide it. its best to do it while all your options are wide open.<br>  good luck!!!<br>  <br>  and i hope i helped|`|QoOx93PPaa	It's a shame that you were irresponsible, isn't it? ):<br>  <br>  Considering they'll be paying for your mistake, I'd suggest telling them very carefully. Which parent is more understanding? Tell that one first.<br>  <br>  In other words, tell the one who's less likely to yell at you automatically for it. You deserve it, but I know you're not looking to get yelled at, otherwise you wouldn't want help in knowing how to tell them.|`|a6Us8qF1aa	This is one more time the life teachs the tuff lesson the hard way.  However, you will not have to kiss your life or youth away, but you are gouing to have a greatly changed lifestyle with a great deal more responsibilities.<br>  <br>  First off, I hope you are religous.  You mad a mistake, but you should be forgiven and not condemned by anyone.  Through God's love and the grace of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus, all things can be worked out.<br>  <br>  I suggest the following in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Determine for sure that you are actually pregnant.  There are various organizations that can assist you.  Check with Planned Parenthood for information and setting up a future plan to raise your baby right.<br>  <br>  2. Tell your boyfriend.  Now you will know what he is made of.  If he is good; he will stand by you.  If he is bad; he will abandon you.  When you tell him,be calm and do not blame him.  You make it sound like you both mutually agree to do this.  Now the seed is growing.  Share the information from Planned Parenthood with him and ask what he can do.<br>  <br>  3, If he wants to stand by you, talk to his parents first with him present.  Be prepared for their shock and dismay.  However, have your plan when the two of you talk to his parents.<br>  <br>  4. With your boyfriend and his parents, now inform your parents.  With the crowd, they will be shocked too, but far less able to shout, rant, and rave over your poor judgement.  Share your plans with them.<br>  <br>  If everyone agrees, you and your boyfriend should have a better time dealing with this.  If your boyfriend dumps you, you are not totally on your own, your parents should assist you some, but you are going to have to work after school some and do a lot of night time changes and dealing with crying.  All the things your mother did for you when you came into the world.  Check out a book from the library on raising a child.<br>  <br>  Keep the baby!  Think how would you feel if you knew you were adopted or given up; what would you think?|`|4FvN0FP4aa	you have to sit down with you parents and maybe have your boyfriend and best friend there to help you. you have to tell them now! <br>  then you have to look at your option<br>  abortion <br>  adoption <br>  raising the baby yourself.<br>  what did the father say? consider that.|`|Il7LEOLfaa	your parents wont be mad at you. Frustated but not mad. Tell them whats going on now. They will find out soon no matter what. If  you have the baby, i suggest giving it to someone for adoption. Good luck your in a hard situation.|`|BxwkOa6Vaa	Be calm. im telling right now i dont belive in abortion. please dont do that to the baby it never did anything. just tell your parents calmly. its all you can do. i hope that helps.|`|AA12254690	PLEASE. Tell your parent today. You will need to eventually so teh sooner  the better. Please feel free to email me if you need someone to talk to.  Good luck! Adoption is a beautiful thing!!|`|lzTOlaqiaa	theres really no easy way to tell them. I got pregnant at 15 and kept it to myself for 4 months. You need to find out what you think is best for you right now, thats all I can really say.|`|aUIsuOEaaa	omg! your so young! you'll just have to sit them down and tell them you made a mistake and you need there support.good luck! =]|`|JnMIusfNaa	o ****...i would tell your parents for sure..but make it seem like you are upset about it...but dont get an abortion|`|6jAXTluIaa	Absolutely tell your parents immediately so they can help. Seriously consider adoption if you're against abortion because there are families that are able to support a baby right now and at 13 it would be very hard to support a child. I got pregnant at 22, have a bachelors degree, and I am barely able to pay bills for me and my baby! And although her dad and I are not together we have 50/50 custody which is wonderful we are able to do that but it is still very very hard for me and I'm in the ideal unwed parent situation! I'm just saying consider how hard this is going to be before you take on the responsibilities of being a parent at 13. I hope that didn't sound mean or anything... ahh good luck|`|il1m93yvaa	Chloe don't listen to them. <br>  God obviously made it happen for a reason.<br>  It's a new beggining.<br>  I'm 13 and it's okay.<br>  sometimes things like htis just happen so you should really just tell your parents because if they find out really late then they will be madder trust me.<br>  It's your baby a nd no body's going to tell you what to do but remeber to be selfless and do whats best for the baby. <br>  Consider adoption. especially if oyu wont get all the support the baby needs, but if you consider keeping the baby you need to make sure it has a stable home and a loving environmaent and family.<br>  It will be fine.|`|gaxgKxfAaa	The hell its ok Sadie.<br>  <br>  It irresponsible and foolish.<br>  A CHILD her age should not be engaged in sexual activity.<br>  You reap what you sow girlie.<br>  <br>  Keep the child, if it survives birth, at 13 the body is not equipped to birth a child yet. My sister fell pregnant at 15, and i have NO qualms in calling you a bloody fool for what you did.<br>  <br>  If you DO both survive the birth, you better make damn sure to take care of that child, its time to grow up and be responsible for your actions missy.<br>  <br>  So grow some balls of your own, DONT rely on your boyfriend as he will likely run off, and tell your parents AND his!|`|ujtCEmnOaa	Yes you should tell your parents. The sooner the better so you can get the best medical care. Your only 13 so your body is def. not ready for the changes that will happen. Your BF is only 15 and cant be making that much money raisng a baby costs alot of money and time. You should talk to your parents. I hope all works out ok|`|Es6XJpcBaa	it is going to be okay.<br>  <br>  you should tell your parents. yes they will be mad, but they have to find out sooner or later. then go to a docter and make sure you are for sure pregnaut. <br>  <br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck =)|`|2wfe3Wozaa	talk to your parents and his be honest your parents are your best friends.you shouldn't be having sex at your ages to begin with sex comes with responsibilities as you found out.|`|CHCPnvksaa	There's no good way to tell them without them being upset and disappointed, but you're going to have to be honest with them. Just sit down with them with no distractions like TV or anything and just come out with it. The sooner you tell them, then the sooner all of you will be able to figure out what to do, whether it's keeping the baby, giving it up for adoption, or terminating the pregnancy.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Get an abortion.|`|91570a0146f250c792909304f3b1f793aa	you need to tell.<br>  i just wish you were around when i was 15|`|sunuId5aaa	oh my. <br>  <br>  yr gonna have to tell them no matter what<br>  the sooner the better.<br>  talk to whoever your closer to, whoever understands you more.<br>  (: goodlook, best wishes.<br>  <br>  ps;;dont get an abortion|`|P85LVLCTaa	well you can tell them about the job but get a job and tell your parents and also depends how your parents are|`|JtUuMdRKaa	ok normally i do not approve of abortions but since i do not want this baby to go wrong and ur only 13, well, yeah, and come clean ASAP|`|dH9IhDIFaa	Tell your parents right away.  They will be able to help you consider what to do.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	ok, first of all, you will need to tell them fairly soon, because you can only hide it for so long. you just need to sit down with both of them and talk about it and let them give you their honest opinions about it. then you will most likely have to make a decision about keeping the baby or giving the baby up for adoption.(i do not say it, because the baby is a living being). <br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Let me say this first: If you have sex, be prepared for the consequences. I knew the consequences, and even though I used a condom, I got pregnant.<br>  <br>  Okay, as for telling your parents, just tell them. They'll be mad, if they're not then you're the luckiest person in the world. Have you told your boyfriend? He really needs to know.<br>  <br>  Having a child young is very hard - I should know, I had my daughter at 16.|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Well you're just going to have to sit them down and tell them. They may be upset at first so be prepared for that. My parents were shocked and disappointed when I first told them, but they still loved me and they were supportive and helped me a lot. I have 2 kids now and everything turned out great. If your bf has a job, he definitely needs to keep working and start putting money away for the baby. He should make sure he's working as much as he can. And this summer, he should work full time all summer. Have a baby shower..it helps a lot with getting stuff for the baby. Shop on Craigslist for used baby stuff or go to garage sales. That helps a lot too. Just remember, try not to take your parents' first reaction too seriously. They will get over it and they will still love you. You should try getting some babysitting jobs for now and save that money too. When you're old enough to get a job, get one. Some places hire at 14. Good luck!<br>  <br>  And the first response you got is cruel. What do you mean "ew get rid of it?" Its a baby..its not ew. Its a baby. You don't just "get rid" of a baby.|`|Jg0ECvyVaa	I dont think you should get rid of it,, but at the same time you should be more careful with boyss<br>  <br>  okeyy tell your parents first and i they dont take it well<br>  call kids helpline and they'll probably have some contacts to help you.<br>  Oh and just ignore all those negative comments :)<br>  <br>  good luck and be careful next time!!|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	dont get rid of it. ask his parents to come to your house. your parents and his parents will sit with the two of you. then explain what happend and how you both feel. please tell them ASAP!!! you need to get to the doctor.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	You need to tell your parents you had sex and got pregnant.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, he's 15, he can't support you and a baby.|`|4TqadRJYaa	ask to be homeschooled for a year or semester or soemthing then they will ask why then tell them.
FrWhdRL1aa	Yes it would be a good idea!|`|umbWaDBXaa	First of all for anyone to down you or call you hateful derogatory names shows much ignorance on their part.  You are 13 and pregnant..it is what it is.  Calling names and shaming you is in no way helpful or needed here.  Just concentrate on what's best for you and your unborn baby.  I think home schooling would make things a lot easier on you as being pregnant at such a young age is going to cause hardship for you in many different ways.  Trying to learn in an environment such as public school while you are in this condition will only bring out the hatefulness and ignorance of kids at school.  You don't need that as that would not be good for you or for your baby.  If you can, choose home schooling at least until after the baby is born.  Chances are you will be able to learn at home and take care of things that are pregnancy related also.   Everyone makes mistakes in their lives.  I am sorry that you have had to learn this at such a young age.  However, God bless you and your little baby, and hopefully a lot of love and prayers will get you through.  Do not abort your baby.  He/she is there for a reason.   Take care and I wish you and your baby the best!|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Maybe but it could be bad though? It can be pretty isolated and lonely for young mothers even if they are in school. You might not be happy having so little social contact? <br>  <br>  In a lot of places there are schools for pregnant teens or teens with babies/young kids. They usually have a daycare and stuff so baby can come with at least until a certain age and you can visit at lunch, class breaks. The education is not always the best at those schools but it can be helpful both socially and also for getting help/info on parenting stuff, etc. Once your child is older you could put him/her in daycare and go back to regular school?|`|lc51V6EAaa	yes definetly, unless you take plan b|`|rM8WrUFNaa	I know this isnt what you want to hear right now but yes you should be home schooled while you are pregnant and then you should give the baby up for adoption and go back to school after the baby is born. Im not a whole lot older than you and Im having twins and trust me I couldnt even begin to explain to you how much Not only a financial responsiblity youll be faced with that at 13 you wont be able to handle.|`|kvCa4xCmaa	so your parents can suffer too from you having this baby and being irresponsible? no, you need to stay in school and get a job and take care of this yourself because it was your fault that you got pregnant and you can't put that responsibility on anyone else but you and the father and occasionally ask for help from your parents. if you can't do it.. you should put the baby up for adoption|`|tp6t4QrDaa	I was home schooled. :)<br>  Andd.. i think its a pretty good idea. <br>  Ignore these b***** <br>  now that your in this i guess you should consider whats best for your baby, tell your parents. They deserve to know. :)<br>  But for heavens sake do not abort it.<br>  Good luck<br>  xxx|`|gE7CFNXuaa	I think you're much too young to be having a child, and you should consider adoption or abortion. Continue your education at a real school and go to college. Don't go down the, what I'd like to call, "McDonalds employee" road.|`|l8ql67Itaa	yes, you should get home schooled it will be the best for you and it will be easier on you.|`|Lnb9SdExaa	yes. have you told your parents your pregnant? add the answer in additional information thingy.|`|vygYFdsSaa	You're a baby yourself!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	yes! congrats|`|PEugVDLOaa	it probably wouldnt be a bad idea to be home schooled , but whatever you do please do not abort this baby, give it up for adopton if you and your family cant care for it|`|BiIdiINJaa	i think anyone telling you that you need to close your legs should pull the sticks out of their asses.<br>  <br>  <br>  girlll, you do anything you have to, for your education and your baby|`|RGn4ry2zaa	I was home schooled before I had my baby. I guess, I didn't have a choice, but if you do try to put both the baby and your education in your thoughts.|`|FEAWVuOuaa	I think it woud be a good idea for you to close your legs, oops, too late for that.

FrWhdRL1aa	I think it would be a wonderful idea!|`|umbWaDBXaa	Yes, home schooling would be best for you because of the hateful comments and negativity you would get just like you are getting from hateful and ignorant people on here.  Why some people think they are so perfect is beyond me.  And for ANGELA!  What gives you the right to talk to anyone about being a disgusting excuse of a human being? You are are a disgusting excuse for a human being just for thinking you are so much better than this young lady.  People like you DISGUST me beyond words!   Don't listen to ppl like this.  A mistake has been made and you will have to deal with it..not these morons.  Good luck to you and your baby!  It's all your choices of what you do.  So do what you think will be right for you and your baby.  God Bless!|`|8TD28ZG9aa	holy crap im 13 and wow thats stupid of you to have had a baby at such a young age!!!!!! do your parents know??? r u ok with everything??? and yes home school would be great!!!!|`|y5DAfNtHaa	you've just wasted your youth.. that's all..|`|5hCoZbqcaa	well i am 15 and pregnant and right now i do home school and trust me if you are planning on keeping this baby then seriously consider home school it will make things a whole grip easier. good luck i know i already love my baby and couldn't imagine giving it up i know i am young and i know i shouldn't be pregnant but i am so the criticism can stop towards every young parent or soon to be one!! if the girl is gonna have the baby and keep it it is her choice and you don't need to leave rude remarks its hard enough without your help!! <br>  <br>  but anyways good luck to you and your baby hunny.|`|oyYlI8D0aa	okay im 14 and im pregnant also...<br>  keeping the kid isnt your only option, and i honestly wouldnt recommend keeping it at your age.<br>  or my age.. whatever.<br>  anyways, if you are going to put it up for adoption, then your school should allow you to enter a homeschooling program while your pregnant.<br>  <br>  personally, i do think you should get homeschooled, because something like teen pregnancy isnt something that people look up to...<br>  and trust me, i know how you feel.<br>  i wish you best of luck with whatever you choose.<br>  <br>  and to all the negative comments your getting on this post, dont listen to them.<br>  <br>  goodluck :)<br>  <br>  xoxox|`|AA12254690	yes but please if you do choose to do that do not give up!!! it's waaay easier to quit school in home school but dont do it!

t8giDjt7aa	1.  Every baby is different my son is 6 months and sleeps about the same. So I think it's normal. If you're worried so much that he's not getting enough sleep ask the dr. <br>  <br>  2. I haven't lost my weight yet but I'm going to try to keep up with the diabetic diet which is really good because you get lots of protein with whole gran breads.<br>  <br>  3. With my daughter she stopped wanting the bottle at 1 year so I'm hoping my son will do the same.|`|JtUuMdRKaa	ummm... well, just for the weight part, i was totally fine till 4 months and then i began losing weight, don't put your baby on a diet, he's a baby! i'm 11 noe, my very bony and weigh 8o pounds, don't worry about it, i think, but i'm not so great at this...so yeah|`|7geLpG6Oaa	1. Every baby is different. If you get him into a good routine then he should sleep for at least an hour or two in the afternoon. Does he take a few cat naps? My daughter is 8 months and takes little cat naps throughout the day but my son would always just take an hour long nap or so. <br>  <br>  2. Diet and light walking. Weight watchers is great! <br>  <br>  3. That's totally up to you. It depends on you and your baby. Is your baby ready, are they easily attached to things? If so the earlier you break him, the easier it will probably be. If changes don't really bother him then you can wait. Are you ready for the change and to deal with some possible backlash? My son took a bottle until he was 17months and then told me no one day and took sippy cups from then on. I have a feeling I'll have to break it away from my daughter earlier though because she won't even try to drink out of a cup.|`|lzTOlaqiaa	Um well my 7month old sleeps about 40 so...I think its normal.<br>  <br>  Ive heard of the diet where you drink something that contains vitamins and other ingredients...famous ppl use it.<br>  <br>  As far as the bottle Im gonna stop giving my daughter a bottle as soon as shes one.

(We BD's every "high" day and both "peak" days<br>  Unfortunately, had another miscarriage a few weeks later<br>  But, used the monitor and saw I ovulated 16 days after this m/c.  Period came 15 days later so I knew my cycle was not sooo messed up!  We did prevent pregnancy to get in a normal cycle.<br>  This month we did not BD every high day b/c we were going to wait another month to TTC but, last minute we decided not to wait so I only hit the last "high"day and the first "peak"day...but that was this weekend so I do not know the results yet.<br>  <br>  Here were my stats with monitor (to the best of my memory)<br>  1st month= high day 10 peak day 13 day 27 found out i was pregnant<br>  2nd month = miscarriage (started bleeding) high day 13 peak day 15<br>  3rd month= high day day 12 peak day 16<br>  <br>  Goodluck!!!

Then you dont have to worry about taking a pill every day or whatever.|`|duinadV4aa	me personally i liked the depo shot it work good for me|`|GLfsQ9P7aa	My favorite was Yasmin.  I also took ortho tri and it was terrible.  I was moody bloated and gained a lot of weight.  I tried a couple other ones and the best for me was Yasmin.  It helped with the acne just like othro but it was like night and day, my husband noticed the difference.  Good luck!|`|VzLkSZ4faa	i cant take traditional birth control because of the hormones. they cause me to completely lose it. luckily when i had enough i decided to get pregnant. but as soon as my baby is born im getting paragard. its the hormone free copper iud. you should look into either that or mirena. mirena has hormones. good luck!|`|G766dQjtaa	Try Mirena. I heard good things about it and is the BC i'm getting after my baby comes. Good luck in finding the one that works for you.|`|9Gsx32Skaa	you know what the crappy thing is about being female? we are the ones who are primarily concerned about birth control. Im trying to nudge my husband toward getting a vasectomy, and why not! Insurance covers it! why should we women have to undergo a lengthy tubal ligation which is extremely expensive and requires down time, when our men could easily go get that tube snipped in a matter of minutes. sorry I went off on a tangent there but this just gets me so worked up how we women have to accept the short end of the stick.  anyway, pills  suck bigtime, thats how i got pregnant with my first son. then i had depo provera shots for 3 years after that and worked great, exept i couldnt lose any weight while on depo. then i had an IUD inserted, which lasted for 3 years  but it got knocked around somehow which led to the pregnancy of my second son. so at the current time we are using condoms which i hate but is much better than getting pregnant. I tried nuva ring and that thing kept slipping down so i was never comfortable having sex with just that.  right now, i need to find something as well, so i will be watching this topic.
2Pp2cDbJaa	adopting someon who is a teenager is not going to be easy, she wont just warm up and call them mommy and daddy and you her brother.

Ga7rI488aa	What you had to go through must have been awful, and it's great of you to consider throwing your sister-in law a baby shower.

If you feel bad she can't have one and you like her and wan't her to have one and you also have the money to do so then why not.

If your just trying to get over it still and don't want to deal with the stress of planning something like that then give the money to her sister so they can do it and if you want you could help them a little bit intill you feel unable to and then let them take it from there. im sorry you lost your baby.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	The fact that you are asking means you are second guessing it.

During your period you are shedding the lining of your uterus and the unfertilized eggs of your previous cycle; thus pregnancy is not possible.|`|46ijdaH6aa	You CAN get pregnant on your period.

J5TbYvVZaa	My son went through this. He would hold it for days and days and when he would go, it was a big production where he would cry and say it hurt. We tried the Miralax, per dr. instruction, and also tried changing his diet. It worked temporarily but I didnt' want him on Miralax forever. Another mom recommended a book called Everyone Poops. We checked it out from our local library. We read it to him several times a day. We talked about poop all the time. We took him with us to the potty to show him mommy and daddy pooped to. Within 2 weeks, the problem was solved. We haven't had any problems since. For him I think it was in his head - he was embarassed. Maybe that's what's going on with your daughter. Good luck...I hope you figure it out soon. PS...I think they have video too.|`|PqPc10Fgaa	it’s fairly common for children between 2 and 5 years old to hold in their stool. Your daughter may be constipated if her bowel movements are hard and dry like pellets, sometimes even streaked with blood; she strains to have a bowel movement; and she has stomach or bottom pain.<br>  <br>  Your daughter’s constipation may have started after the bad diaper rash or if she developed a little crack around her anus, which might have made bowel movements painful. Sometimes young children hold in their stool to show some independence and control when they feel pressured to toilet train. Children can also become constipated when they are picky eaters and don’t eat a wide enough variety of foods or drink enough fluids. <br>  <br>  Here are some general tips for preventing and dealing with constipation:<br>  <br>  Give your daughter more high-fiber foods such as whole-grain cereals and bread; fruits (e.g., prunes, apricots, plums, and raisins); and vegetables (e.g., peas, beans, and broccoli). For now, try to avoid foods that tend to be more binding, including rice, bananas, applesauce, citrus, and cheese. <br>  <br>  <br>  Give your daughter more liquids to drink including water and juice (e.g., prune, apple, pear, or grape juice).<br>  <br>  <br>  Make sure your daughter gets plenty of physical activity every day. This helps the bowels move.<br>  <br>  <br>  Consider holding off on toilet training until her bowel movements are more soft, comfortable, and regular. Let her get used to pooping well in her diaper, where she feels most comfortable, before making the transition to the potty. Once she’s having regular bowel movements and seems ready for toilet training, encourage her to sit on the toilet for a short while after breakfast each day to try to develop regular bowel movement habits (see the article on this website on“Toilet Training”).<br>  Talk with your pediatrician about your daughter’s constipation. If the above tips don’t resolve the constipation, your doctor might prescribe a stool softener such as mineral oil for a few months. This will make her stools soft enough so that she can’t hold them back and they will no longer be painful. Sometimes the doctor will prescribe a rectal suppository or enema to clear out the hard stool before starting on a stool softener.|`|HN9FG9udaa	My daugter started doing this around 18 mths. I took her to the dr's and they said it is very common among children. Once it hurts they continue to think it is always going to hurt so they hold it in for as long as possible. Our peditrician placed my daughter on a med called miralax. Its a simple powder mix that you mix with their juice. It is tasteless as well as mixes in very well so it can not be seen. It takes a few days to work...It is designed to bring liquid into the intestines so the feces stays watery and doesnt dry up and get to hard. It took my daughter about 3 months and she is totally off...The earlier you start the easier it is to get them off...It could take up to a year our ped told us! Good Luck I hope this helps!
88cf073c1a10431f8f96825fd98241e8aa	I turned to my friends my husband was little supportive as he felt really helpless and yes i know the feeling. But i just kept myself busy with my Friends and busy with my work and house and honestly after about 4-6 weeks i got really used to the new pace of things. Don't worry I think we all think that nobody knows how we feel and that nobody cares but that's not true. My friends took wonderful care of me and my husband found his confidence later on in the pregnancy. Its sad that he isn't there to support you in your pregnancy right now but don't feel overpowered by the feeling because you will be together soon in your new environment. Btw i find it a lot more comfortable when my husband doesn't sleep in our bed in the later month because he has this habit of hugging me to tight and making me feel uncomfortable (its a good thing he works night shift).|`|AA12016833	I'm in the same boat. Pregnancy hormones play a big factor in this. The best thing you can do is to find that motivation. Look forward to your future. The only thing that should be on your mind is taking care of yourself and your baby. If you are feeling alone, try and contact your b/f more and keep in contact with friends and family.|`|AA10906062	Just keep telling yourself how lucky you are that he is working so hard for you and the kids. He is a wonderful man not to walk away from you like most other dead beat dads out there.Try taking up a hobby( puzzles,knitting,sewing,painting) to keep you busy and use your imagination as to how great things will be as soon as you are together again.|`|rM8WrUFNaa	Im sorry you and your man have to so far apart. Im in the same boat. I get to see my fiance for a week and then for two weeks he works out of state. Im feeling the same thing you are, alone, unattractive, lazy, all of the above. I dont know if you have family near by or friends that dont drink Every night but I would say to try and surround yourself by them as much as possible and even then it may not fill that void, I know it doesnt always work for me. As for the "attention" part when your mans away, now Im not trying to be vulgar in Any way but buy yourself the "Rabbit"and always keep lots of pictures around of your man. Another thing that seems to help me a lil is he recorded himself singing on his cell and then sent it to me and I put it against my stomach so my babies can get to know his voice even though hes not around very often.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Hey I'm sorry you are going through that, please don't turn to another man.<br>  <br>  Im 37 weeks pregnant and alone since about 8 weeks pregnant. I have friends or mom or sister go with me to ultrasounds. My mom went on the hospital tour with me. I *try* to replace the dad part with family or friends. <br>  <br>  I think I have depression, but my family says not to say anything to the doctor. Something about them taking the baby away. SO I try to *burry* the sadness. It's okay <br>  <br>  IT WILL GET BETTER SOME DAY!|`|nlKZRNqmaa	Well I am in a similar situation..... but I am working and have two kids already so I try to focus on them right now. I am trying to work all the hours I can before I am out for maternity leave as well. I know it is hard and it can affect you physically and emotionally... try not to let it get you down. Try to keep contact via phone.. pic messages and things like that to keep you afloat. Good Luck!!
uNsWwMfwaa	At this point you should go see your OB/Gyn and discuss things with him/her.  The increased hunger isn't a symptom of pregnancy, you would actually be nauseous and only able to eat "bland" foods for the most part right now if you were pregnant.  But they can examine you and give you a blood test which will measure the amount of hCG if any, in your system.  The blood test never lies, it will tell you beyond a doubt if you are or aren't pregnant.  It doesn't sound like you're pregnant to me.  Sorry, but good luck if you're trying!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Probably not...........just relax and your period will most likely come.  You said you had a one day period and then at the end you said no period.  If you had bleeding and not just spotting (pinkish or brownish discharge) then your most likely not pregnant.|`|iAphlpqKaa	i think you're just paranoid... check again, maybe twice to be sure. but you're probably okay|`|g6sCUoO7aa	You sound like you have irregular periods?<br>  The best thing to do is wait another few days and take a test. If you are still worried, please go see your doctor :-]|`|pHIbnjuBaa	If you want to know if you are pregnant, go to a doctor or wait a week a retake the test.|`|G766dQjtaa	Take another test in about a week and see what it says, it sounds like you might be pregnant.|`|Q3DgupYyaa	take another pregnancy test or go see a doctor
OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, it's normal to feel itchy. It's because of your growing belly/breasts as your skin stretches. But in your case, it's your hormonal changes. I started to itchy like crazy on my palm of my hands, and around my hips when I was about 4 months preg. I read that hot showers and baths can dry out your skin and make the itching worse. So, whenever you take a shower or a bath make sure the water temperature is not so hot, but warm enough that it's comfortable. Use unscented moisturizer. (Some scents cause irritation). Trying taking an oatmeal bath.. you can buy preparations at drugstores. Stay away from heat... it intensifies the itching.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	never had that before. i've had nausea thats it, but no itchyness.|`|Efa5EYJJaa	Yes before I took a test and found out that I was pregnant I itched and got a rash on the back of my neck. My skin got kinda dry all over and I had to use lotion constantly. Everyone is different, pregnancy can cause itchiness and even rashes.|`|ZDMhqzBYaa	No this is not symptoms of pregnancy.
KU0tnveUaa	definitely "just wants some".  <br>  <br>  stick with oral, kiddie.
57c0ffd2f3fe653cbff5be9c939ce07baa	A late or missed period could be caused by any of the following: <br>  <br>  Pregnancy:<br>  This is the most common cause of missed periods in teenage girls. If you have had sex even once in the past several months, see your health care provider for a pregnancy test before you consider any of the other possible causes. <br>  <br>  Stress:<br>  Stress is the second most common cause of late or missed periods in teenagers. It may be emotional stress (for example, breakup with a boyfriend or final exams) or depression. Or it may be physical stress to the body, such as a severe illness, a sexually transmitted infection, rapid weight loss or gain, or strenuous exercise. Dieting or binging and purging may interrupt menstrual cycles. Changes in your usual routine (for example, going on vacation) may also cause your period to be late or missed. <br>  <br>  Normal development: <br>  During the first couple of years of menstruation many teenagers have irregular periods. During this time the body's hormones are not yet "fine-tuned," so the ovaries may not release an egg once every month. As a result, your cycles may be irregular, occurring as close together as 2 weeks or as far apart as 3 months. <br>  <br>  Hormone imbalance:<br>  Hormone imbalance is rarely the cause of missed periods. <br>  In teenagers, polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common type of hormone imbalance that affects the menstrual cycle. Polycystic ovaries may cause irregular cycles, increased body hair, acne, and weight gain. <br>  Sometimes when you stop taking birth control pills you may have a temporary hormone imbalance and loss of periods. If you are having sex, be sure to use another reliable method of birth control because you could still become pregnant. <br>  Problems of the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, adrenal glands, or ovaries can be rare causes of irregular periods.|`|cafea661e3fce1da868ce36e2a3c3d25aa	first of all the patch is on recall. it doesn't work and is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  your doctor should have told you this...but as far as I know, this has only been brought to the attention of Canadians....as I am....<br>  <br>  anyway, if you're a month late, you shouldn't be on here asking us, you should be taking a test. <br>  <br>  stress can throw off a period but for a month....I don't think that long...|`|923fc19ab1b82db24d38d7167dbf6545aa	You're not giving us much information.  Have you been using a form of birth control?  If so, what kind, and how consistently?  It is impossible to give advice just by reading your question if you don't supply us with any background information.  :)<br>  <br>  I just read your additional information.  If you are not on a form of birth control, and you are having unprotected sex, then of course you could be pregnant.  There's not much you can do now besides taking a pregnancy test to find out one way or the other.  You can buy an over the counter test and it should work fine  since you are a month late.  Or you can visit your doctor and request a serum (blood) test.  Those are very, very accurate. <br>  Good luck!|`|d5ee02e41a282956da551de4a2538d41aa	to find out go to a local free confidential place that does pregnancy tests...that's the only way to be sure is get a test done...or take one at home, most of them are accurate. don't be scared to take a test, you need to find out as soon as possible!
SaRDq9iLaa	I had a "reception" for my daughter's christening at my house.  We had a sheet cake, which was actually made at Shop Rite.  It had a pink cross made out of flowers and said 'God Bless Brianna Lee'.  Congratulations and Good luck!|`|jYPeis3Saa	we're getting our son baptized in april. he will be almost 18 months so yeah we've procrastinated on it. <br>  <br>  we're not having anything too big either. only about 10 people. we will be having a bbq at my in-laws (they live near the church where the baptism will be and we live an hour from it) and a cake. the cake will probably have a cross or say something like "Zachary's Baptism"|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Typically there is a cake usually with a cross and maybe pink or blue in the color scheme.

My church don't do the whole cross thing. We usually do a simple rectangular cake with pink/blue frosting, the baby's name and baptism date on it, and maybe some storks or something to decorate. For my niece, my grandmother baked a lovely cake in the form of a pram, with a small baby in it. But she's creative - if the cake pan isn't already in the form, I can't do it!<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby's baptism.
n2O0NwR6aa	Oh yes... people do change!  Sometimes for the worse, sometimes for the better.  My brother-in-law barely graduated from high school; he was constantly suspended for drinking, drugs, skipping class, etc.  Now he's a high ranking executive with a major corporation, and is a wonderful, loving, responsible husband and father.  Complete turnaround!  You just never know how people will turn out.|`|laLW1Krwaa	I had a friend who In second grade stole my lunchbox and my money and everything from me.

Sometimes it's sad though. Like this girl I knew a few years back was sorta dorky (well, actually she was really dorky) but she was nice.

0JYyL4KNaa	1. What are your feelings about kids/teens having cell phones?<br>  <br>  I'm perfectly fine with kids having cell phones. To me, parents only see the bad in cell phones and not the good. A great example: For those very overprotective parents who let their child go to someones house and you call that persons house nonstop to check on your child. Instead get them a phone so you can aviod conflict with other parents or whomever.<br>  <br>  2. What age is appropriate for a child/teen to get a cell phone?<br>  <br>  I think 12ish is good, but I know tons of kids who got phones way before then. It depends on the situation, sometimes. I got my daughter a cell phone when she was 11 because she attended a school that wasout of the district. Therefore she took two schoolbuses. She also had after school activities and sometimes she missed the bus. Calling on school phones can be a hassle because they administrators bug them about who they call and why. It's easier with a celll phone because they can simply call, text, e-mail, or send their parents a voice SMS.<br>  <br>  3. What is your age?<br>  I'm in my 30's<br>  <br>  4. Do you have children? If yes, what are their ages?<br>  Yes I do.<br>  A girl, 13|`|AA10683267	It really depends on the kid and their lifestyle.  My oldest got her first cell phone when she was 15 because that's when we could afford one for her.  My middle kid got one at 12 because she has sports practice and does a lot of travelling for school.  It really helps to have that communication.  My youngest doesn't play sports or travel without parents.  I'm not going to get her a cell phone for fun or to text her friends because she is irresponsible with her things and a cell phone isn't a toy.  My kids also pay their own cell phone bills from day 1.<br>  <br>  If a child is away from home quite a bit, is responsible, and willing to pay the bill - then it's time to consider a cell phone.|`|pwlgAnb3aa	1.  i think TEENS having cell phones is a-okay. my parents bought me one, and i am fine.  however, my parents bought me my phone to get ahold of people through calling.  my texting/internet bill i have to pay for myself. and i am perfectly fine with that. they set a time in which i couldnm't use my phone, (junior high it was 9, high school 11)  every month they check to ensure that i didn't exceed this limit. also, my parents were divorced, so my cell phone made it a lot easier to get ahold of whichever parent i was not with.<br>  <br>  2. i think kids should have cell phones when they get to middle school/junior high school. that is the age when you start to go do things with your friends other than just having little slumber parties with there always being parents. like when they go to the mall or movies without parental supervision.<br>  <br>  3. 18, senior in high school.<br>  <br>  4.  no, but i have one and so does my sister (who is 15)|`|iDTrTvg4aa	1. about kids/teens having cell phones?   they shouldn't  have  cell <br>  2.they can have cell when they r mature   may be  some 16 or 18|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? <br>  <br>  1. I feel teenagers shouldn't have a cell phone unless they pay for it themselves.<br>  2. I feel an appropriate age for a teenager to get a cellphone is when they can afford it. They will learn responsiblity. Plus, it's for their amusement.<br>  3. 21<br>  4. No, I do not. <br>  <br>  ?¤·?|`|a9YfUGzSaa	1. What are your feelings about kids/teens having cell phones?/  I think it's a waste of money unless they need one.  I kept getting left behind at school when I was 15 because I got a ride from my friend, and if I got hung up after class she'd think I wasn't coming and leave without me, so my dad bought me a phone to use for emergencies.  My sister got one at 13 and I don't believe she needed it yet, I don't see why they spent the money.  I also won't drive without one, it doesn't feel safe to me.  My mom let's me borrow my sisters to drive if something happens to mine.<br>  2. What age is appropriate for a child/teen to get a cell phone?/ Whenever they need it.  10 year olds back and forth between mom and dad, you might want them to have one so they always have access to a phone without you having to rely on your flaky ex or whatever.  I didn't need one til 15 or 16.  My sister probably still doesn't need one and she's 16.  Depends on your family situation.<br>  3. What is your age?/ 19<br>  4. Do you have children? If yes, what are their ages?/ No, I used myself and my little sister as examples.
BthSjSEHaa	Apparently, when a woman is at her most fertile, she also gets 'in the mood' - I guess it's nature's way of making sure it happens! Good luck TTC :)|`|96HWpdkFaa	My husbands in the military too, and i get the same way! lol you might as well take advantage of the time you have together! It's hard being a military wife and that is the truth! I just found out I was pregnant 3 weeks ago...my husband might not even be here when the baby is due!!

But now he's back and you two can have all the fun! lol
CxRJwJsraa	not hopelessly dorky...but not quite ready, I don't think.<br>  Maybe this next generation of children will look to Ernest for their babies (I feel the same way about Orval/Orville, which I love). Personally, it is the Ernest from the Ernest movies that drags the name down to me. All I see is a redneck/hillbilly. However, I can get past that image and I get an image of a kind British man who is polite, but determined.<br>  <br>  I think he's wonderful middle name material in the meantime though.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I don't see why it can't. It is a good old classic and you are right about other names in Ernest's era coming back into fashion.<br>  <br>  Jack and Leo have done it so why can't Ernest?<br>  <br>  Another name that has similarly come back into fashion is Theo/Theodore and also Caleb.|`|SxPhldhhaa	I'm actually not too sure on this one myself. I wouldn't be surprised if it made a comeback, but on the other hand I'm still rather iffy on it. I can see it becoming increasingly popular, since as you mentioned it does have some very strong ties to literature, and the name might appeal to literature buffs such as myself (although now I'm more of a baby-name maniac). And many seemingly outdated names may be making a comeback.<br>  <br>  But on the other hand, Ernest doesn't seem timeless nor does it seem to have a big chance of becoming popular. I think it's just really lost its feel now, and younger parents might see it as rather dated and much too old-fashioned for their taste. The main thing that gets to me is that I can see an adult or an elderly gentleman named Ernest, but I'm not picturing a child or a teenager named Ernest quite so well. That may also be another factor.<br>  <br>  Who knows?|`|bIaywrBCaa	I think it could. I love the name because I had a wonderful uncle named Ernest.
DHwPgw9iaa	Hopelessly dorky! At least for now. :] Hey, anything's possible. If it's socially acceptable nowadays to create your own name (Zaidyn?!), then Ernest may very well come back in style. I just really don't see it happening anytime soon though.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason, like you mentioned, that these names make a comeback is because of some huge pop culture issue that really makes an impression on society. (Think "Bella" from Twilight. Everyone loves that name now!) If the next movie has a really hot guy for a main character and his character's name is Ernest, I think that might speed the process up a little bit.<br>  <br>  Until then, Ernest will probably stay on the back burner with Mildred and Ethel. :)|`|hcqNXUH5aa	When you put it that way, then yes, it may.  I think Emil could also make a comeback.|`|YcLImmyraa	I actually thought about this the other day! I know a lot of people with children called Alfie, Archie, Harry etc. but no one tends to use to full name - I don't know any Alfreds, Archibalds or Henrys. I think people find these full names too 'old' for a child, so they just stick to the shortened versions. <br>  <br>  Ernie is cute, but I think it'll be a while before it makes it into the top 100 names. Also, the name Ernie immediately makes me think of Bert and Ernie, then Ernie Wise the comedian, then the Benny Hill song... So maybe for people in Britain, that's one reason why it's not popular!|`|qfUjyUDTaa	I like Ernest...Its a classic. I love that old names are making a comeback - I would love to name my son Arthur...after my Grandad. My Grandma's name is Isabel - another beautiful old name that has made a comeback!|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Sorry, like I said before, I think this one is best left to the Muppet.  It's really dull, in my opinion.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	My 12-year-old son is named Ernest/Ernie, and so is my husband - as well as his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.  <br>  <br>  It's definitely not a name I would've picked on my own, but I didn't have much choice... and to be honest, I was pretty nervous about naming my son Ernest.  I worried about him being teased.  Ernests & Ernies on TV and in the movies are always portrayed as being fat, bald or stupid.  Which is really unfair and annoying!  <br>  <br>  But my son and husband have never been teased about their name.  Well, they do get the occasional "Where's Bert?", but they just laugh it off.  Neither of them are dorks.  My husband is very successful and, I must say, pretty darn hot!  And my son is very popular - he plays football & baseball, does well in school, has tons of friends, and even a few girls hanging around!  <br>  <br>  If a few more people start naming their kids Ernest, maybe the image of dorkyness will start to fade!  I hope so!<br>  <br>  Speaking of comebacks, though... I'm banking on Walter to increase in popularity pretty soon.  It's really a nice name - and Walt is pretty studly!  =)|`|81nGin29aa	Well, the main "Ernest" I remember growing up was the redneck character Ernest P. Worrell played by the late Jim Varney (1949-2000).   I have all the films on DVD.<br>  <br>  Maybe the name will make a tiny comeback if its variations "Ernst" and "Ernesto" are around.  Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  As for "Alfred", there's the goofy musician Alfred "Weird Al" Yankovic. <br>  <br>  Besides being my maternal grandfather's first name, "Clarence" is the middle name of my mother's nephew Kenneth C. Crandall and her grandnephew Britton C. Clark.|`|POGZZmoUaa	You're not dorky, it is a strong adult name and a cute one "Ernie" for a little boy.  You were thinking of it as a boy's name, right?  Trends or comebacks have to start somewhere, so why not.  Just be sure it goes with your last name.  I like it.|`|5d573e43d278a547e9503d25ae2fcc31aa	I think Ernest is hopelessly dorky like Ethel or Mildred or Algernon. but I also don't like Alfred, Walter or Clarence.|`|QG7g2s7oaa	I know a kid named Ernest.  He's a pretty nice guy.<br>  I also know a Frank and Harvey.  <br>  <br>  I like all of those.

bc03dab618aec5ff8ab9a0fe8b49c27eaa	Hi there. I started babysitting at age twelve,also. I've got to be honest, more often than not, you are going to get a lot of people saying that you are not old enough to do it. So you should start with people who already know you well. Friends of your family perhaps. And when you get those opportunities ALWAYS do a stellar job and stay consistent. Before long they will be recommending you to their friends and so on. You'll do fine honey. Remember: (1)ALWAYS BE ON TIME-EARLY IS EVEN BETTER (2)NEVER GET TOO COMFORTABLE-REMEMBER THESE PEOPLE ARE TRUSTING YOU WITH THEIR PRECIOUS CHILDREN (3)ALWAYS BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT GOES ON (4)ANYTHING YOU CAN'T DO IN FRONT OF THE PARENTS SHOULD NOT BE DONE WHEN THEY ARE AWAY EITHER<br>  The course is a great accomplishment and I commend you for it but experience is what puts a parent at ease. And if you keep the parents happy by doing a great job with their kids not only will they spread the word but they will likely provide you with great reference letters for new jobs with those who haven't gotten to know you so well yet. Go Get 'Em Sweetie! Good Luck!|`|a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	to be honest i would never leave my child with a 12 year old, you are just old enough to be left alone at home and sit in the front seat of a car. it takes more to be a babysitter than just a red cross coures. babies are more than that. its patience and selflessness. sorry its just my opnion.|`|16b3340f6b3002b4cd5a1b38e48064f1aa	I'm a parent of 5 year old twins.  I probably wouldn't feel comfortable leaving you alone with my kids because the 2 of them together are just crazy troublemakers LOL and they have deadly allergies, so it requires an extra level of responsibility.<br>  <br>  When I'm looking for a sitter, I usually don't care much about babysitting courses, I want to know how much actual experience you've had with kids.  So if you don't have much experience, I suggest volunteering in  the nursery/sunday school room or start as like a mother's helper.<br>  <br>  Age 12, I would say age 3 and older, and probably just 1 child at a time.  Babysitting is a business, so you should ask for whatever you feel comfortable with. I would suggest $5/hour.<br>  <br>  As far as tips:  remember that if the kids don't like you, they will tell mom and dad that, and you probably won't be asked back.  So try to be fun, avoid power struggles.  I know it will feel good to be "in charge", but keep it in check.  Just spend time with the kids and play what they want to play!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2b20c1bc3cd1bc36c9f8aa5b481c7e33aa	I am a mother of 3 small children.  I would have a 12 year old babysitt during the day only and for 2-3 hours at a time.  I think that feeding dinner and putting 3 kids to bed would be too much responsibility for a 12 year old at night time.  I think 2 yrs and up would be a good age range for a 12 yr old.  I think playing with the kids is key, because if the kids like you they will want you to come back.  Talking on the phone and watching tv is not babysitting it is leaving the kids unattended, which can lead to accidents.  To keep the parents asking you to come back, please make sure the kids are clean when you get home, change their clothes if needed and most IMPORTANT make sure the house is picked up before the parents come home.  There is nothing worse than coming home to a house that is messier than you left it.  I pay my 12-14 yr old babysitters $5-$6 and hour.  Also, tell the parents of any misbehavior so that it can be corrected for the next time you babysitt.  If you don't tell the parents the problems you are having the kids will continue with the bad behavior everytime you babysitt because they know they will get away with it.  Don't worry about upsetting the parents they won't get mad at you, honosty is best for everyone.|`|CPxlYn27aa	that is awsome you have completed the red cross babysitting program people will love to here that! I would def. have a young girl like yourself watch my son because of that it looks very responsible... <br>  <br>  When I was young I went into public librarys and hung flyers with my name and a phone number they could call me on, it was awsome and I did get some great jobs ...<br>  <br>  I have had a few babysitters... around maybe 15 or 16 its up to the person, I first babysat at 13.<br>  <br>  good luck hun! - Dana C.

eDmdkUO3aa	I would wait and see how you feel after you have the baby. That might change everything. But, if you are still feeling down after you have the baby, you need to tell your doctor. Everybody will get the baby blues, I know I am more emotional since I had the baby. Good luck sweetie! Hang in there!|`|HXh7u0lEaa	You should tell your Dr -  they will not take your baby and they can (if it's very bad) give you something that's safe to help. Also you may be more prone to postnatal depression after you baby comes so if the Dr knows you suffer now they will keep a close eye on you afterwards, it's really important you get support when you feel low. Also it is normal for you moods to go up and down during pregnancy especially in the 1st and 3rd trimester, so the Dr will not be very surprised to hear that you feel this way -lots of women feel the highs and lows during pregnancy.|`|IGfnrfGPaa	Talk to your doc. I suffered from depression during my pregnancy (Hubby was in Iraq), and I suffered from depression after giving birth. I refused to take any meds during the pregnancy, but took Zoloft for a few weeks after. I got better after a few weeks. You need to get help, a depressed mother is not the best thing for a baby. Good Luck.|`|rM8WrUFNaa	NO talk to your Dr. he can find ways to help you...like counseling. When your depressed while pregnant it creates stress for your unborn baby....they feel Everything we feel. My mother was very depressed while pregnant, her and her Dr. honestly believe it strongly contributed to my sister crying constantly. As long as your not having thoughts of hurting you or your baby no one while take it away.|`|46ijdaH6aa	I would seriously talk to your doctor. If your depressed now than you could have post partum depression which is SO MUCH worse than depression. They will give mediciation to help. Dont worry if they question you in the hospital, it's normal ruiteen. Just dont go around saying you see or have bad thoughts about someone or something hurting your child. Than you might have to worry, cause they will worry about the safety of the baby. Depression can be treated, just talk to your doctor. Nothing horrible. I'm sorry to hear about your baby daddy, I went through the same thing, and I had Post Partum for a while as well. I wish you the best =]]|`|pHIbnjuBaa	Your mom and sister ARE NOT DOCTORS. Tell your doctor what you feel. If the father of your baby is not around, that is probably why you feel like this. Your hormones are going crazy right now and that is adding to your depression. There are women that get angry about everything, there are others that are always sick and others that just have it easy. Your doctor might just ask you to go to a counselor and talk about it.  GO to this website and read about it. <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_depression-during-pregnancy_9179.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_depression-d...</a>|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Tell your doctor.  They aren't going to take away your baby at birth.  Normally during pregnancy, since hormones are all out of sorts, women do experience depression.. Just explain to your doctor what is going on, and he/she will decide how to help you with the depression if it's something other than the pregnancy causing it.  Good luck!|`|0AGjMJ2Baa	Definantly tell your doctor! their are many things that he can do to help you with your depression, and you might find that its not depression, that your just tired of being on bed rest. <br>  And unless you are going to hurt the baby, he will not take your baby away.<br>  Best of luck moms.|`|PEugVDLOaa	my doctor put me on zoloft when i was pregnant if he is a good doctor just talk to him about it and he will understand . And he would have no reason to take your baby . Sometimes it gets wore after pregnancy and the they will put you on an anti-depressant.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I WOULD tell the doctor especially since being depressed during pregnancy puts you at higher risk for post partum depression. Your doctor should be able to help you or refer you to someone who can. Best of luck to you and your baby.|`|4jeqIx6Paa	you know your not alone mama im the same way right now i been so stressed out and i dont feel happy at all my babys father puts me through so much hell that i cant even start telling you how i really feel ! its not good but i know the doctor probably may give you some pills or whatever i dont know because i dont want any pills thats why ... i really dont know how to deal with it myself

It may give you pregnancy symptoms like morning sickness at first. My husband never felt it. But if it's a problem for you you can take it out and immediately reinsert  it after sex. It never fell out for me. Not even during sex. I never felt it...but it may take you a few days to get used to it being up there.
e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	No it wont work 2 days after you have sex. She needs to wait until her next period is skipped. The cost depends on which brand you buy. You can buy some for only a 1 at the dollar store or some for 7 bucks up to 20 bucks.

8fec3ad76af4c7fed4391a09e1dcc81eaa	It is always possible to become pregnant after unprotected sex.  Now, if you are pregnant or not, note that it is normal to be bloated and have a small pudge even before your menstrual is due.

88cf073c1a10431f8f96825fd98241e8aa	With my first son I took 3 pregnancy tests and they were all negative only the blood test showed the real result. With this pregnancy now i took again 3 tests and they all had different results the first was positive but the control bar never showed the second was positive and the bar was there and the third one was negative and the bar wasn't there so I really only rely on a doctors opinion and test now.<br>  Tests are only supposed to be accurate from the day you miss your period of course i only trust my own body and a blood test go see an OB/GYN|`|lhn1wNoeaa	There are more chances of being pregnant. As you got your implantation bleeding too..lets hope for positive.Your hormone level should be low so that your getting negative in HPT. So wait for test tomorrow. Lots of baby dust to you. Try to let us know the result.
AA12306087	After the mother delivers the baby and the doc or whoever cuts the cord, the mom will deliver the placenta, which gave baby all his/her nutrients throughout pregnancy.  At our hospital, the placenta and umbilical cord are kept in a refrigerator in the lab for about a week.  This is because if anything happens to be wrong with baby, they can sometimes do testing on the placenta to see if the cause was something that happened in utero, or during pregnancy.  Don't listen to all of the mean people on here.  The only way to learn something you don't know is to ask!|`|a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	i hope you are a boy and i dont think you understand the process. the cord is not attahed to the mother, its attached to the baby and a sack the baby was in. the sack comes out after the baby does. and the only magic is the mother holding the baby for the first time.|`|64cf42bc52ec850f15dc4a39f2b95979aa	They dispose of it and the after birth at birth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is the facination about umbilical cords????? No they can not reinsert anything!!!!!!!!!! Get a childbirth book!!!!!!!|`|beef266dcb5b77fe9d3c8770d1727382aa	This cord you are talking about is called the umbilical cord and it is attached to the placenta and the baby. It gives the unborn child what it needs.<br>  After you give birth to your baby there's the "afterbirth". This is when you basically get rid of the placenta, you give birth to it.<br>  What you do with it is up to you. You can keep it and what the doctors will do to it, i don't know. Throw it away?!<br>  <br>  For more information about the umbilical cord<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_c...</a>|`|de465617622ebcd3524d9100ae21dc5faa	I think you should research the topic of child birth .. I learned all about it in the 5th grade
eNBoG2L5aa	Wow you sound like me.  I went through this 2 years ago with my last child.  I had 3 other children at the time and a very supportive husband.  I would just cry.  And cry.  and have a very alone feeling.  I knew it was probably my hormones talking....but I also knew that something was not right.  I told my husband what I was experiencing, but never told the Dr.   I chose to work it out myself, but I also had my faith and the support of my husband and kids.  I had 3 girls and never experienced anything like this and this last pregnancy was a boy...completely different.  So...your not alone.  It happens!  Just so you know I was fine after I had the baby (Just really tired, from late night feedings).  Looking back, I probably should have at least made mention, at least told them I was feeling "blue" from time to time.   Just in case that feeling did not go away.  Good luck to you, and remember your not alone!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Depression symptoms are totally normal during pregnancy, due to the variations of hormones.. If it gets too bad, talk to your doctor.  Maybe he/she can help.  They won't call social services or anything unless you're to the point where you're wanting to hurt yourself or the baby.  Cheer up, though! :)|`|Xx0Xsgwzaa	feeling "blue" is a part of life. as long as its not on a day to day basis and your sure there is nothing serious bothering you, i wouldn't be worried. if you think you have a problem, see a doctor.|`|1w41ReD7aa	Totally normal! Girlll I'm depressedd & sad all the time too! It comes&goes,but goodluck girl& congrats!|`|AA10244380	Absolutely tell your doctor.  She/he won't turn you in for child abuse for a child you haven't had yet!  Besides...it is very common.  Your hormones are ca-razy right now.  I cried all the time when I was pregnant- for no reason!  After I had the baby I got severe post-partum depression and I didn't talk to my doctor about it for a couple months.  She got me on meds that really helped me.  Silly I didn't say anything, I could have gotten help sooner!  But, like you, I was afraid they would call the authorities and take my baby away!<br>  <br>  My sister got very sad when she was pregnant, and her doc put her on anti-depressants during pregnancy, and she was 100% after that!  <br>  <br>  You are normal!  Get some help so you can enjoy the rest of your pregnancy.|`|qJvMWlBUaa	Thats actually normally but treatable you need to talk to your doctor they want do that!|`|xubIaiZaaa	i get depressed every now and then too, I would see your doctor, they wont call social services- as you are not suicidal, but they WILL help. The most important thing is that you get happy again so you can look after yourself and your baby. <br>  If you are depressed now there is a high risk that you will get the baby blues once the baby is born.<br>  Honestly, the best thing you can do is talk to someone, depression is very common, and you aren't alone.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	yes, its very normal. I cried just about every day of my pregnancy. If you speak to your doctor he can perhaps give you something to make you feel better. I did not take any thing. I just kept crying. Now a happy mother of a 6 year old.|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	you might end up with post pardum depression after you have the baby. you need to let your doctor know just in case. it happens to a lot of women and can be very serious to you and baby. you should speak up|`|kwMuRDFjaa	It's normal

pzLDXL6gaa	I've seen this before. Asking a weird and unfunny troll question once is fine, but repeatedly doing it is very unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|ki5hZbcTaa	a woman gets her period because the lining of her uterus sheds, because when there is no baby, there is no need for it. That lining is what the baby attaches to when a woman gets pregnant and therefore is not shed and doesn't come out like a period. Get it?<br>  <br>  This is what you would have learned in sex ed if you were paying attention. LOL|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I've seen this question before. If you don't know the answer to this question, what the hell are you doing having sex? A woman's cycle stops when she is pregnant.|`|U3CBAPsaaa	What? don't you know what a period is? You aren't supposed to have your period if you are pregnant|`|HXh7u0lEaa	Yes the baby must be a vampire go ask the Dr for more info about this|`|46ijdaH6aa	ha ha are you serious?? I'm pretty sure if you don't know this answer than you should really go buy some books on women and pregnancy. You need to be educated before bringing a baby into this world.

What's the Sex Education like at your school? It doesn't sound like they are teaching you about the good ol birds and bees where you are from.<br>  <br>  When you are pregnant, you don't menstruate, meaning no "period." Your gf should talk to a doctor, because you don't know enough to be able to help her.<br>  <br>  -kidx|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I hope this is just a troll.  Women don't have their period during pregnancy.  Women only have their period to shed unused eggs.

Please go and buy a book and read about how a female body works.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	period is missed every month during pregnancy - this is what will happen always. if bleeding is seen it should be reported to the carer/ But if no bleeding is seen this is fine.<br>  The baby is not able to drink the blood. the blood will be expelled at the end of pregnancy. After birth occurs.<br>  Also the baby is being nutritioned from the umbilical cord. not through bubs mouth..<br>  <br>  So dont be worried.
x3fQP9viaa	Constantly saying positive things, you are doing great, i love you, you are a good kid.  Kids like simple no brainer things, make cupcakes, don't yell, go to the park.  I use my states' website, to look up free things to do.  <br>  Compliment your child, your clothes look nice or your hair.  <br>  Buiding confidence is an awesome trait of a parent.|`|EvMvSHULaa	You don't have to "do" anything that you wouldn't have done as a married parent.  Sure, everything now falls on your shoulders alone, but your child doesn't know this.  All you have to do is be there and show your love.  Don't fall into the overcompensating trap to make up for the child being with only one parent...you are enough.

I'm not sure what TTC means, but the only thing I could think of to stop you from getting pregnant would be if your woman area is an environment that is too acidic for sperm to survive. Men have a secretion in their semen that lowers the acidic pH inside of women so that the sperm can survive.  Sometimes it doesn't work though.  Other than that I'd talk more with your gynocologist or maybe see a fertility expert if it continues not to happen. Good luck though :)|`|a7pgX1W8aa	No I don't think your to small to carry. My grandmother was only 5 foot tall and she had 5 kids. Just try to relax and not worry. The more relaxed you are the better chance you will have. Hope this helps.
2W0qWjNLaa	With my first pregnancy i only tested two weeks after i missed my period and only got faint lines.  Just depends on person and how much HCG is being produced.  Best to try an "early" testing kit like First response digital or wait a couple days and try again.  Good luck!!|`|8PwgWFGMaa	I'm in the same boat with my period not being here yet! Wait about another week and if you still have no period go to your doctor and take a blood test since those detect hcg much better! If you don't want to spend that money,(40 dollars) then take another hpt in 2 days! the hormones (if you are pregnant) should show by then!|`|AUznwh1raa	you could have gotten a negative because you tested to soon.<br>  when was the last time you had sex?<br>  wait until two weeks after that day, and test again.<br>  but even then it might be to soon for symptoms like your boobs hurting.<br>  it could be stress, or your period is just playing a game and will come tonight or tomarow.|`|ek2LPKMZaa	I know its hard but try to think of other things for the next few days and see if she just shows up.

If you are taking tests at home, and you suspect you could be pregnant, try taking the tests in the morning when you first wake up, so that you get a more accurate reading. If you still have a negative result and still have not had your period, go see your doctor right away, he may have to perform some type of biopsy to see what is actually going on.|`|e5a2eb5216e1bce2bd0e75985a35f16aaa	doesn't sound like you are pregnant at all....|`|0398540980349182d33b912f856f9c5faa	sounds like you are fine. maybe stress is the reason you have not started.

I realized it was the room that was the problem.    Feeding is not the only reason babies do not sleep well and it does not mean you have to feed them just because they wake up, sometimes its just something else they need.  Your baby just may not like fruits at all, I hate em so it isnt incoceivable to think he doesnt either.  What you can do is give him a variety of things and let him choose what he likes, you can do this by letting him touch the spoon, play a game with him and observe what his likes and dislikes are. We seem to think we have to give our babies certain foods and although they need fruits you can give them other alternatives and/or mix them with something so they do not notice it.   Babies are pretty good at letting us know what they like and dont like, yours certainly is.  As for the sleep thing it could be the environment and not the food, try changing the environment it could be too cold, too hot, poor ventilation, alot of things and even loneliness so perhaps putting on some light soothing music could help too.|`|AA11639030	my aunt feeds her baby 6 oz of formula every 3 hours and she sleeps through about 7 am... try rocking him while you feed him formula andhe should fall asleep and stay asleep til morning time|`|a61e01fa9a373d19655e53f895483001aa	OK, first of all you are the parent, you need to take charge.  Hint: when a baby won't open it's mouth, you gently pinch his nose closed.  He will open up like a little bird and you pop the food in.  I too, though, have used the trick (before I learned the nose one) of showing the baby his bottle to get him to open up, then popping the food in. Don't feel bad.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you should NOT be feeding an 8 month old baby ANYTHING during the night, nor hugging him to sleep.  Feed him up good before bedtime, put him to bed, and DON'T GO BACK TILL MORNING.  You need to let him cry it out and break this bad habit of waking up to eat in the night.  he doesn't need to at this age.  He won't stop on his own, you need to make him.  Stick to your guns and good luck.

Grab a cover and put it over your brain as that seems to be the part your thinking with.   The girlfriend should do some reading on sexually transmitted diseases to know that she could be putting herself at risk.

You're being responsible by preventing unwanted  future pregnancies.|`|AA11301969	I think that your reaction to the procedure and how it affects your "womanhood" is a personal thing.

ycPYssBCaa	The best way to know for sure, is to call your local WIC office and get the info straight from them.  They will tell you what you need to bring with you to the appt. to confirm income, address, marital/custody status, etc. and can tell you exactly which parts of your income you are required to claim and/or prove.  <br>  <br>  I would also suggest considering relactation.  I knew a mom who only breastfed for the first two weeks or so, but her baby got sick at 6 months with recurrent ear infections.  She worked really hard for about the next 2 months at relactating, but eventually did get a decent milk supply back, and only had to supplement a couple of bottles of formula a day.  <br>  <br>  I also knew a woman who started off with formula, let her milk "dry up" (although it was never 100% gone), and then had a change of heart about 6 weeks later.  She was able to get a full milk supply back in just a few weeks.  <br>  <br>  The thing that helped them the most was a Supplemental Nursing System.  See the links below for an example/explanation.  They can allow you to give your baby the formula supplements they need while suckling at the breast to stimulate milk production.  This can eliminate the need for bottles and let baby satisfy all of their sucking needs at the breast.  <br>  <br>  This may not be something you would choose, but the option is there and may save you a LOT of money in the long run, in addition to being healthier for both baby *and* you. :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|DHz46NJUaa	No they dont take out for daycare.

But unless you don't believe in using pacifiers I wouldn't push it too much, it is a terrible habit to try to kick.  I really wish that my children didn't, but they did.  We even offered a pacifier!|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Why do you want her to suck her thumb?

My son was not a thumb sucker and it wasn't a problem.  He didn't even care for pacifiers.  My daughter was an aggressive thumb sucker and we had a heck of a time getting her to break that habit.  If you go with a pacifier, you can take it away when you're ready.  With a thumb, it's always there for them.  As a matter of fact, our dentist told me when she was 5 years old that she had better stop sucking her thumb before she caused permanent damage to her jaw bones and permanent teeth (which weren't even down yet).  Babies always suck on their hands and fingers, but beware of the aggressive thumb suckers!

IpxjCtLYaa	WOW....I think you're asking if Planned Parenthood is a building.  So yes it is, a business in a building.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	First it is Planned Parenthood, onder  I'm assuming you ment OLDER and STUPID not stopid and DIDN'T not dident  and FACE not fase.  Incase you haven't noticed there is spell check.  It has a green icon and it says CHECK SPELLING.  I'm guessing that you're right, you're not 12, but I think I am gonna go for 9?  And to answer your question, Planned Parenthood is a building.  To find where one is, you look in a phonebook.  Those are those big books that your parents keep near the phone.  They're yellow and white.   Next time you want an answer, and a polite answer at that, I would suggest not saying "so in your FACE" in your question.|`|uBICgcbAaa	It's an abortion clinic that forces teen girls into getting abortions and was founded by a racist who wanted to exterminate the Black race because she idolizes Hitler.|`|a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a><br>  <br>  i dont get what you said under your question, but if you are 12, dont have a baby. its hard.|`|ef88a8ae3afde5ec4c890c32c8b9c3faaa	PLEASE USE 'CHECK SPELLING'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  What is hod, ppl, onder, stopid and dident......................|`|q4I46wyGaa	Your spelling indicates that maybe you are a little YOUNGER than twelve.......Planned parent hood is a clinic where females---usually older than twelve....go to have a pelvic exam, pregnancy test etc....Is that clear enough for you?  I'm not sure that I could explain this using any smaller more simple words....Thanks for the laugh, I love when unintelligent people try to get smart and look like a total horses rear doing so!|`|WOf4THqyaa	Its an organization that offers assistance for a lower price or free. It offers annual exams, birth control, and regular OB care for pregnant women. Some of the clinics perform abortions|`|e02e0878424b9748092bdb4b635d6bacaa	learn how to spell until then,don't have children.
AA11110785	Your fiance's sister can take the baby to any fire department and drop it off there no questions asked.  She won't get in trouble for not wanting the baby.  They take the baby and give it to child services and they will put the baby up for adoption.  <br>  She can also give the child up for adoption also but if that is to much trouble for her, then just tell her to drop the baby off at the closest fire department.|`|6aX2j0Slaa	take her to a pysicologist please. A baby is a gift from god why does she say that?? this kind of ppl don't deserve to live.|`|IDIuG7W1aa	i hope to GOD that this is a joke. <br>  if not, then I would call the local authorities. like child protective services. <br>  do you think maybe she said this just ouf of frustration?<br>  do something, and do something NOW|`|a93b5b57666d0fcc9da475fa410635b3aa	Get her some mental help and tell people about what she is planning to do the more people who know about this then the more people there will be to support her and hopfully help her make a better decision. Now if this is a joke please dont waste peoples time with this question. Stuff like that is not funny and you should be ashamed of yourself if you are making this up.|`|0b5adaaea5663c7b0951ddd9fce23234aa	Some people say stupid things. Maybe its just that. If you don't think so, you need to talk to someone, like a school counselor or the Child Protection Agency. If she is a danger to her baby's life, she is needing psychiatric care and supervision.|`|9UPJnpMoaa	How far along is she? If she doesn't want to look into the adoption option, hospitals are safe houses. She would be able to drop off the baby there with out any consequences legally, and it can be anonymous. I say legally because at some point late down the road her deciion may come back to haunt her emotionally. Talk to her about these options in a friendly way, and be there to support her. She may just be scared.|`|AMbkiqL5aa	There are so many people who want to adopt. Somewhere out there there is a couple who wants a child and can't have one, who will make great parents for this child.|`|L4y5uLT1aa	TAKE THE NEWBORN BABY TO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PLACES WITHIN 3 DAYS OF BIRTH:<br>  A HOSPITAL, A POLICE STATION, OR A FIRE DEPT.<br>  THEY WILL TAKE THE BABY WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED. THIS IS A LAW SET UP TO PROTECT BABIES FROM BEING DUMPED. THE MOTHER WILL NOT FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES AT ALL AND DOES NOT HAVE TO LEAVE HER NAME OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION!!!!|`|P2d5tY3raa	You could try suggesting adoption to her. There are millions of women out there that want babies that can't have their own. There are always some listed in any major newspaper, that will pay all of the medical bills, etc. The hospitals and some other agencies in the city where I live all accept babies, no questions asked, for 3 days after the birth. How far along is she? If she is less than 3 months, abortion could be an answer.|`|VA1N3aMGaa	call a child advocate agency.<br>  Or protective services.<br>  Call someone.<br>  How does a person become this calloused?|`|YL60JWr4aa	Am I understanding that she's planning to deliver the baby and then throw it out on the street?  <br>  If she doesn't want to keep the baby,  someone (it doesn't have to be the mother) should take it to the nearest Emergency Room and tell them that the mother feels she cannot care for it.  In most states (if not all), emergency personnel must assume care for the infant without attempting to trace the mother, and that way she will not be responsible for child abandonment, which she can be charged with if she just abandons the baby on the street.|`|jYTZmrLgaa	Tell her about the safe houses.  She can take it to any church, police department, fire station or hospital without any charges or questions.  It is illegal to "throw" a baby in the street.  Talk to her and ask her to seek help, there are also adoption agencies that she can go through and even help choose her child's parents.  You can even tell her that you will take the child to a safe house, but it is not the child's fault that she had a "oops", she should take responsibility for her actions and make the responsible decision.|`|sb6Ov4FIaa	Tell her to bring the baby to a local fire department. If she is really serious. They just adopted a law that allows women with unwanted infants to drop the baby off with no questions asked. However, I would really try to talk to her. Because this will be something she is going to regret but it is better than abandoning or leaving the baby for dead.|`|a1c4d77a079d1c9876c98151851f92b3aa	Oh wow! Maybe she's just emotional and scared. Please talk to her. She has tons of other options out there. Her doctor could advise her better.|`|gBmevRbFaa	Im sorry but your fiance's sister sounds like a complete idiot. I hope you dont mean literally throw the baby on the street. Make sure you get her to see an adoption agency as soon as possible.
0257d63f2ad2a28173df5b7b66b6909aaa	If you are a good canidate to get it done, then your insurance should cover it.<br>  <br>  If you don't have insurance look into getting Medicaid or doing a flat rate with a Dr.  Some doctors will take a flat rate of say $2000, that covers every appointment, test, hospital, delivery...etc.  Definitely a great deal as today's pregnancy can cost upwards of $20k for a vaginal delivery and $30k for a csection!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	I saw your previous question, and just about all physicians will not do an amniocentesis unless there is a medical reason to do so - they will not do one simply for paternity reasons.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid you will likely have to wait until after the baby is born.|`|3cfbb8fa8a31590bb2dab47e04487d10aa	I've never heard that a doctor won't do an amnio unless medically necessary. I've had two children, going on my third... and I've always been asked if I wanted one. Medicaid covers it. However, the reason for an amnio is to check for disabilities of the child. If it is for paternity reasons, you might have to pay... and it all depends on the doctor that you go to.|`|AA10824873	Ooooo I think they are covered by insurance, but only if refered by the doc. I don't think it is an elective procedure.|`|csc5QGGVaa	The risk far out weighs the cost. If you value your babies life at all then don't do it.|`|dd7afa427b0b97cbad4abf34381626d3aa	Your doctor wont do one unless it is medically necessary and DNA is not considered medically necessary. You will find out if your the father sooner or later, so just wait.|`|zZajnNEnaa	Amniocentesis is a prenatal test that is usually performed during weeks 15 to 18 of pregnancy.  If your doctor suggests you have this testing done you should discuss the cost and insurance coverage before you have the procedure done.<br>  <br>  Some insurance plans cover amniocentesis and other prenatal tests, especially for women over 35 years of age. You may need a referral from your doctor or pre-authorization from your health plan for your health insurance to cover the procedure.<br>  <br>  The cost to the patient or insurance company averages about $1500.00.  Prices range from $1100.00 to $2000.00.  The price range varies widely from area to area and will depend greatly on where you live.

My daughters and my wifes eyes changed both between 6 and 8 months.  My sons change with his moods, as do mine.  and I am 32 yrs old.  They may not change at all.

Puede ser una infección, incluso puede tener amibas.

Y con el grito de "quien como Dios" es que los angeles protegen a la humanidad del mal.

Recuerdo cuando le daban a la mamá solo sopa y no se ba?aba ni se levantaba en todo ese tiempo, ?Guacala!.<br>  Sin embargo debemos de tener en cuenta de que el parto es algo extraordinario, que un bebe se gesta y crece dentro de la matriz durante 9 meses y que un día sale por un lugar especial y hecho para ello, pero debemos de tener cuidado, igual que en una herida saturada. esperemos a que cierre naturalmente para poder movernos naturalmente de nueva cuenta. De lo contrario podríamos padecer de desgarramientos peores.<br>  Saludos.|`|Bba5BgRdaa	Saludos!!!! Mira, si votas sangre porque tu organismo esta volviendo a tomar su curso normal, quedas muy adolorida y mas si hubo desgarramiento, y los médicos te piden que no tengas relaciones, ya que puedes hasta quedar embarazada nuevamente y tu cuerpo apenaz se esta recuperando y tus tejidos están volviendo a su forma anterior, y bueno si aun esperándote los 40 días te duele bastante al tener relaciones imaginate antes, te lo digo por experiencia, ya me daba miedo tener relaciones aunque me estubiera muriendo de ganas, es muyyyyy doloroso, ciao.|`|MlNryOcQaa	tu mama tiene toda la razon no ves que cuando tienes un bebe natural todo haya abajo se habre y se descontrola so en 40 dias tu cuerpo esta tomando sus lugares para acomodarse denuevo Tu mama te tuvo a ti so ella sabe lo que se pasa creele|`|WbxIxRhqaa	Es verdad...

Generalmente despues de tener un hijo si le das el pecho, despedis sangre durante un  tiempo, porque de esa forma eliminas todos los restos que quedaron del embarazo y te limpias, como dicen. El tema de la cuarentena es relativo, yo tengo dos hijos y nunca conte los dias, pero seguro no fueron 40, cuando me volvieron las ganas, listo...<br>  <br>  Espero que se te hallan sacado las dudas...

62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	My favorite is the baby drawing contest.  You take a paper plate (not styrofoam) and put it on top of your head, then you draw the best baby you can. Mom picks out her favorite one and the person wins a prize. I ALWAYS win that one cause I've mastered drawing a crawling baby without lifting the pen.    Next favorite is the guess whats in the bag game.  You take 5 ziploc baggies and fill them all with white powders.  Baby powder, salt, sugar, baking soda, detergent, bath crystals, flour etc.  Spray them with perfume so they can smell it, write numbers on each bag and everyone writes down what they think they are.  whoever guesses all 5 wins.    Next favorite is the cotton one.  Blindfold the person, give them a spatual and have them try to scoop off as many cotton balls into the bowl as they can.  The kick to fake them out.  Make loud oooos and aaahhs so they think they have a whole bunch, when they only have one.  Let the player see all the cotton balls on the floor, then blindfold them, once they can't see take all the cotton balls away, so they're scooping at nothing. Then before they take the blindfold off, put the cotton balls back.  Another trick is to remove all the cotton balls from their bowl, so it looks like they didnt pick any up or add a bag full to the person who didn't get any.  It's really funny when you have a large group hootin and hollering.|`|deIzFnV8aa	At my shower, they bought blank white onsies and fabric markers and let everyone decorate one. It was a great idea! We all had fun, and now our DD gets to sport silly designs from our friends.  Just make sure to get the onsies in a few different sizes so they don't have too many to wear.    Another game we played was matching the names of baby animls to the correct term for the mother (such as calf and cow).|`|lYsrCTCwaa	I went to a baby shower where they took the really small safety pins (the gold ones) and mixed them in with dry rice. Then you blindfold a person, and they have to sift through to see how many pins they can find. It is harder than it sounds.

The first person to hear you say it takes one of your necklaces away. once all the gifts are opened, the person who has the most wins whatever prize you have chosen.|`|a3MdcopDaa	there are so many - check out http://www.babyshowerwish.com/baby-showe...|`|9mtjgnSbaa	my favorite was always the one where the hostess buys 3-4 presents (depend on how many guests ).a number is written down for each guest on a piece of paper and put into a box. throughout the night the numbers are called about 3-5 times. the first time the gifts are just set on a table and if your number is called you take one  then as numbers are called throughout the night you take them from a guest till the last round and you get to keep the gift. oh yeah, forgot to mention the gifts are wrapped so no one knowes what they are|`|HF97Rs9qaa	At my aunt's shower there were several baby diapers with different chocolate bars smashed in it to look like poop... the object of the game was to guess what candy bar was in what diaper by taste testing lol.

dLadxEJSaa	My Moby Wrap goes to 35lbs, but now that he is about 25lbs he is really starting to get too heavy for it when I do anything other then carry him around the house.     We use an Ergo when we are out and about, though its not the most attractive looking carrier, it gets the job done. It works a lot like a hiking backpack, to distribute the weight.     I had to give up the front carrier when he was around 10lbs because it killed my shoulders.|`|yCwPxulYaa	The Ergo carrier is awesome.  This is what I use and I love it.  It is very comfortable.      www.ergobaby.com|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	You can get a regular sling (like a hotsling at target) and carry him on your hip supported by the sling. Otherwise maybe a baby back carrier? I don't know the weight limit on them and was actually looking into them myself. My little guy is about 18 pounds and is getting so heavy in the front pack. Good luck|`|qImMwhUHaa	The sling. It' very versatile and very adaptable.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I love, love, love my Mei Tai carrier and can't say enough good things about it.  At your son's weight, you could just tie him onto your back, and it's no heavier than wearing a backpack.      I also used my pouch sling and ring sling quite a bit when my kids were younger.      I listed several sling websites in the space below...|`|G3sSeUataa	I have a moby wrap (I made myself for $3) that I use to carry my 1 year old in, and it's awesome!  I also tried the back carry with the moby with my 3 year old 30 pounder and it was comfy and he liked it!  I would recommend a moby wrap they are so versatile and just plain awesome!  All you need to do to make your own is go to the fabric section at walmart and go to there clearance fabric and find a stretchy material buy 6 yards and gut it "hotdog style" down the middle so you have 2 pieces of fabric 60 in long and 30 inches wide.  (you could also cut it into 3 strips 20 in wide but it's up to you).  And then sell the other half for $10 and you have yourself a free MOBY WRAP!  Then go to mobywrap.com and get instructions (for free) on how to use the moby!|`|XIeLK7oPaa	You probably want to look at a baby backpack carrier. They have extra padding and support,than most other carriers, and they distribute the weight over your shoulders and hips to make it a little easier to carry around and extra 25 lbs|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i don't know about carriers, but i think some slings hold much heavier babies...i have never been comfortable with a sling though..|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	This one says up to 40lbs.  http://www.babyearth.com/chicco-smart-su...|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	a back carrier|`|YBQvzEhGaa	The Playtex Hip Hammock is what I use for my sons.|`|u94HOVz7aa	try a baby wrap many companies make them or you can make your out they carry newborn to 35lbs and can carry in 5 different positions.  go to www.wearyourbaby.com it has all the info you need
Ez4d9g3vaa	I just asked my 3 year old your question and she said "Daddy would do it".  I asked her how Daddy would do it and she said "Him just put a leash on him and then him a go outside".  I asked her if Daddy could do it by himself and she said "No, I haffa help him".      Now she's all excited about this, she'll be looking outside for moose.  We do live in Canada but the closest thing we see in this area is deer.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Lol a moose! Umm lure him away with meats, I'm guessing.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	With cookies and milk.|`|OxFV92hJaa	lmao, hmm. That would really suck, I guess I'd  turn on some rap music really loud and hope it took off.

He could entertain my daughter while I got some house work done. He seems friendly enough.     If it was a real moose I would jut run across the street to my recently unemployed neighbors house. He's got nothing to do and seems to love endlessly cleaning his gutters and shoveling snow. I'm sure he would relish the opportunity to engage in an elaborate moose trapping scheme.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	peanut butter|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Well Carrie, what can I say.....

That sounds wrong but you wouldn't say meece (like mice) or mooses.  Anyway sorry...I guess if it was a friendly moose I would show him the door and try to lure him out with food.  But I'd first have to come on to YA and ask people if a moose is a friendly animal and what they like to eat.|`|nBaHzNbRaa	i would get a moose call and make him follow me outside|`|ZJbVQJrBaa	dont ley him in daaa|`|GZdvHbT5aa	Give him a cookie|`|AA12145826	First I'd invite Sarah Palin over for coffee and request she bring a gun.....j/k.

cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	Hmm, with the pill and condoms. Sounds like your pretty safe there, unless there were times you did not use them.<br>  Then I would say those are symptoms of pregancy. <br>  <br>  But if you do use them, you might want to talk to your Dr. Might be a something that can be taken care of. Menstral cramps usually don't extend to your thighs, however if they are really bad, you could be in pain all over. (Nerves are odd, hard to determine where the pain begins and ends)
Ge8xMTgRaa	Ok, first of all, I congratulate you for keeping cool. That makes you a very mature young girl and saving money for your car seems very responsible of you. Please tell your mom that so far what I`ve read, thumbs up on her and you.<br>  I`m not answering your question but I get from you how humble you are for accepting her paying and for helping her because if it weren`t for you, she might not having anyone to help her. You`ll be blessed with your children one day, you`ll see. <br>  And about what others may say about raising your salary, of course you deserve better, but right now you`re young and you will earn more money later on. Just help this mom out a bit longer until she finds someone else so you can move on to something better and better paid...people get blessed for being humble not griddy.|`|phUQktLZaa	I think she's taking advantage of you, you should sit down and negotiate a fixed hourly rate that she can stick too before you babysit again, and she should understand that it is your hourly rate regardless of how long you babysit for.

I am saying this from experience in daycare and as a nanny etc. It isnt going to get better.<br>  As far as the money. Technically is should have be like what, $24. So maybe that is why she was thrown off? If you are sticking strictly to the hourly rate. If you do want to stay with this family I would suggest your getting a contract written up, which is what most nannies I know do. It details things such as pay, what should happen if you have to work longer or what not (and also overtime too), vacation and days off etc. <br>  I know it is an awkward situation, I have been in them and have always bit my tongue. But I lost out in the end, and my frusteration over it just kept building. <br>  Good Luck!|`|PobLhimoaa	Stick to your guns, you should charge what your worth. If you are a quality babysitter you deserve more than $3/hour. At that rate, If you saved every penny it would take you over 400 4 hour sessions to buy a $5,000 beater. Make yourself marketable, get CPR trained, straighten up the house etc. We pay our excellent 13 yr old babysitter $8/hr, our kids are worth it.  |`|qdQXwd1Yaa	Ya i highly doubt she can get a daycare for 30 bucks a day. I would have told her to go screw herself, but you obviously have a much better heart than I.|`|bA8RMI9saa	she's taking advandage of you! $3 hr is really good for baby sitting!|`|rE6AARNVaa	Lesson learned, your employed, you get paid.<br>  <br>  You could be too busy next time.|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	damn, 30 dollars is a deal! I used to babysit and I charged 20 dollars for 3 hours, flat rate for one kid. Added another 5 per kid. And if it went between the 3 hour span, i went half for that time. So for 8 hours i would have charged her...50 dollars. (first 40 for the first 6 hours, then 10 for the last 2.) *shrug* <br>  <br>  You're right though. if she doesnt like your prices, she can try to find someone else or a daycare. don't back down. you already admited you give her a amazing discount.|`|7Omj8E3eaa	I totally agree with you ... but i would of snapped at her
DcVoq5Tuaa	don't fret over it, some men are just not able to handle a child that is that young and are very afraid to be alone with them for fear of something happening. My X husband was that way with all their kids but once they started walking (9-12 months) he was a hands on dad until we split up. Just reassure him that he will be okay with her and she isn't going to break if he picks her up. If possible, until he gets used to it, leave her with him when she is sleeping so he doesn't have to worry about fixing a bottle, changing a diaper etc. (ya I know it's unfair but only until he gets comfortable with her--then leave her when she needs feeding and changing).<br>  <br>  Just hoping I gave you his view point.

On the weekend we split everything up he gets a certain amount of alone time where he can go out and do something (golf, hunting.....) and I get some time to do what I want out of the house...<br>  <br>  most new couples with babies go through this. It took us months before we worked out a good schedule where we were both happy.|`|tsBWtqOuaa	Definitely need to talk with husband.  Good communication is what is needed here.  Being a stay-at-home-mom is a LOT of work.  Definitely explain to him how your day goes.  And start leaving daughter with daddy more often so that you get some good time away == even like "oh, I just have to run to the store for 15 min" and then maybe stay 30 min.  Over time, he'll (hopefully) start to realize how much work it is!  My husband says that if mama ain't happy, nobody's happy!  And that's the truth. :)
5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	Usually you have to look at the stroller features to see what infant seats are compatible (for some reason they don't seem to list it on the car seat information pages).  For example on this page I have linked for the Chicco Corina Stroller if you click on features it says which seats it is compatible with, the Chicco KeyFit or KeyFit 30  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3155364" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|AA10424047	There is a stroller out there that adapts to most if not all car seats, so you don't have to buy a combo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=167395&catid=110448&aid=335944&aparam=graco_snugrider_infant_&CAID=2d7bac12-80ae-42fe-894d-71e159012c84" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?productId=3152757&cp=2582969.2582975.2582975&parentPage=family" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?...</a>|`|FLEXqVoiaa	The strollers that are sold in combos are usually inferior to ones purchased on their own. Plus most strollers purchased on their own can accommodate and brand of infant car seat. <br>  <br>  We have a Graco single stroller and a Baby Trend double stroller, and both could securely hold our Baby Trend car seat. And the Baby Trend (Sit-N-Stand) stroller claims to safely accommodate any brand of infant car seat.|`|KESlvKqQaa	Same brand tends to be pretty interchangeable, regardless of the pattern of the fabric.  If you have a Babies R Us near you, go there and try moving the different Graco carseats onto the different strollers.  Since they usually have a bunch of different models on display it's an easy way to check it out.|`|zxC8Loh4aa	Yeah they should fit if they're the same brand. Sometimes there's an adjustable bar thingie inside the stroller (ours has it) that makes ANY car carrier compatible with it. It's very cool. If you're getting it from a store, just ask a sales person there. If you're not, you could always contact the company (ie graco etc) and ask them if this model would fit with this other model. <br>  <br>  gl to you!! |`|EeGgovyCaa	Most likely because I think most stroller companies make them that way now. Just make sure you get the exact same brand and model type|`|24P6A0oaaa	it does depend on the stroller, if you take any type of infant car seat you can fit it in any stroller than takes  those...its like the basic 4 wheeler stroller but make sure it fits and locks in place
hJcrbbGFaa	Se cuenta desde el día que naces porque, desde ese momento, eres un bebé y no un feto. Desde ese momento respiras por ti solo, comes, ... y no a traves del cordón umbilical, como has estado haciendo durante 9 meses (más o menos). En el momento de nacer, ya eres una personita, con un nombre, un registro, ... y es por eso que se cuenta desde esa fecha.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a quien es mayor, es mayor quien ha nacido antes. O sea, el octomesino nacido el 11 de noviembre.|`|aef0fba28418b3eae99ca2813ce45943aa	por que exactamente nadie sabe el dia que lo fabricaron puede saber mas o menos el mes pero nada mas<br>  <br>  a el mayor es el ochomesino|`|Z58BBi1Paa	se cuenta apartir de que el bebe es un ser independiente del cuerpo de su madre es decir q ya "nacio"|`|91ba63f978eae72b3d1486aeb8118bdfaa	Amiga: Yo creo que porque nadie sabe con absoluta certeza cuando fue fecundado, además el nacimiento marca, en cierto modo, el inicio de tu vida como ser humano autónomo ya que dentro de tu madre recibes todo de ella, pero cuando naces debes respirar por ti mismo y alimentarte y todo lo demás, por eso el nacimiento es el "inicio" de tu vida, además es una fecha exacta que todos saben con certeza y por eso se celebra el cumplea?os en esa fecha. En cuanto a tu otra pregunta, siempre es mayor quien nace antes ya que la fecha que cuenta es la del nacimiento.<br>  Saludos y buenos deseos.|`|Dvv91cKlaa	Pues en realidad creo que es un error contar asi los a?os de edad...pero los que apoyan este tipo de conteo dicen que debe contarse asi porque el nacimiento es la fecha a partir de la cual se tiene seguridad de la vida del bebé y es la fecha en la que el bebe es independiente de su madre y deja de ser feto para ser un ser individual...pero si es asi...no deberia ser retroactivo si el ni?o nace vivo?...lo cierto es que para mis efectos es diferente preguntar los a?os de edad que preguntar los a?os de nacimiento que tienes. Por que?? pues porque para mi tendras los a?os de nacimiento que tienes desde el dia que saliste del vientre materno pero tus a?os de edad incluirian los meses de concepcion. La cosa es que no se tiene un dia especifico para la concepcion ya que esta puede ser un o dos dias antes o despues de la ovulacion o en el propio dia de la misma, entonces es mas facil contar desde un dia especifico.<br>  La respuesta a la pregunta variará segun el criterio que tengas para contar la edad... pero definitivamente para mi tendrias que revisar la fecha de concepcion de cada uno de ellos y el mayor será quien se presuma haya sido concebido antes.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, no es lo mismo preguntar por los a?os de edad o los a?os de nacimiento, que preguntar por los a?os de vida, los cuales son aquellos que crees que te quedan por vivir en realidad y  no los que ya has gastado.|`|Yf1BLyJFaa	Los egipcios sí contaban la edad desde el momento de la concepción.<br>  La verdad es que es más lógico.<br>  Lo de los bebés: para nosotros el del día 11 sería el mayor, pero para los egipcios sería el del día 30.|`|pg6moWZHaa	oye, se lo que tu piensas y es muy bueno tener en cuenta que nuestros bebes deben de ser recordados desde el momento de su consepcion pues seria magnifico el tener presente toda tu vida ese dia pero en realidad solo estaria presente  en cada pareja si es que los dos se acuerdan de ese dia, pues de lo contrario el cumplea?os de cada ser humano es en la fecha que nace. y no en la fecha que es concevido en el vientre.<br>  y es mayor el que nace antes
Dus5MPk3aa	You can start to use the early detection tests at 5 days before your period, so you could try tomorrow morning. They aren't as accurate so you should try again on the 1st, unless you get a positive, because then you already know you're pregnant. When using the early detection tests it's better to use your first morning urine because it would have a higher concentration of the hormones and would be more accurate. Good luck!|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Depending on your HCG levels it could definitely be too early to test which is why most tests say that they provide an accurate result on the first day of your missed period. <br>  <br>  Wait til then and test again. Good luck xx<br>  |`|MOsStEbqaa	Just wait till you miss your period and then test. |`|2NYsMRnaaa	yeah it may be too soon yet. did you use First Response? thats the only pregnancy test i can think of that MAY be able to detect the pregnancy hormone this early. i know you're anxious but be patient! sept 30 will come around soon! best wishes and good luck!

UiXJLrDWaa	i dont really know but just follow what the doctor says and you should be fine.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	I did have contractions for 48 hours before I went to the hospital, and thankfully got my Epi. They were an hour apart at first then moved to 15 min apart for about a day, I was so miserable and couldn't even sleep. Just keep calling and they will tell you when to come in. Before I went into labor, I still wasn't sure I wanted an Epi, but after 2 days of that, I was so exhausted, I just needed to relax. It was still another 9 hours before I delivered. But I was a few cm weeks before. You may need Pitocin. I got 2 shots so I could dilate enough. Once your in the hospital, just get the Epidural )IMO), and you'll be fine from there.    Also, they may want you to come in so they can check vitals. If your baby is breech and you're contracting. I might call to see if they can check you out.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	If you are 37 weeks and already having contractions you might end up with a c-section again.  I am sorry to say it but you should prepare yourself for that in the event you can not have a VBAC.  Good luck|`|AA10038269	they could braxton hicks contractions|`|dxTwHB1yaa	They are probably braxton hicks. I had contractions for two days before I went into actual labor.     Labor is coming soon, but not eminent. Just be patient.|`|uoPG3Y0saa	I had contractions starting April 20 all the way to the day my daughter was born, May6 (my due date was May8).  They were not that consistent (45 min, then 2 hrs), but I did go into "fake labor" twice during that time (once at 7 min & once at 5 min).  taking a hot bath helped me.
DWLfKACYaa	I like Tessa Eloise|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Adalyn Claudette    is the one I'd choose from your list.    I like Selione Janessa also.|`|fboC1N7gaa	Adalyn Claudette is my favorite.  It's classic yet unique and flows beautifully.|`|TRkpG3MPaa	Kimberley Lenore  I like that name.|`|1OKx4TYpaa	I guess Kimberley and Tessa are okay.  Selione will be frustrating for your child...always having to pronounce again and again for every person she meets.    I think Claudette is a GREAT first name, though.  I never thought of it.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	YUCK!...Sorry.|`|Z37uRWEIaa	i hate all of them. sorry
hVVALFAPaa	My daughter had hair to her tush. She wanted it cut. I told her that she had to prove to me that SHE could take care of her hair before I would let her cut it. I showed her how to shampoo and condition it, then how to get most of the tangles out. I still had to help with that some.<br>  <br>  After several months of her taking the responsibility, we cut 16 inches off. She donated it to a children's cancer wig group.<br>  <br>  Now, she is sorry she cut it and desperately wants it long again. But it was HER decision. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could work a deal out with her. Long hair until second grade or something. Then if she still wants it shorter, let her do it. This will also let you give dad time to accept it.|`|Nh1ZZz89aa	I would let her get her hair cut, but a few inches at a time, eventually getting it as short as she wants it. She may be adament now about how short she wants it, but once its that short she may not like it. If you do it a little at a time, it wont be that big of a shock, and there may be a point where she says it's short enough, but may not be shoulder length yet.|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	If you have sole custody of her, then definately let her. Its nice that you are wanting to include the father's opinions, but hair isn't a huge deal.<br>  If you split custody, then you might want to mention it to him. I would consider HER wants more than his though. Especially since she has been asking for months, you know its not just a whim that she will regret.|`|W7q3KGvfaa	just let her get it cut! it will be fine. if her father gets mad, then thats lame because its just hair and it will grow back. just take pictures of how it is now and it will be okay:)|`|31569887b5b5a617c4b12e437c8f2fd6aa	It's hair.  It will grow.  Discuss this with her dad.  Maybe she could donate it to Locks of Love.|`|2pxiK9waaa	It'll be so much easier to care for-go for it! Be sure to donate her hair to Locks of Love so she can help another child.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	its a hair cut lol, theres nothing wrong with it...|`|hIzQyflqaa	let her get it done, she is making her own decisions which is cool!|`|eZDoQPg8aa	If she wants it cut, get it cut.  And here is a slightly different spin on the whole thing.  There is an organization called Locks of Love.  They provide wigs and hair pieces for kids with medical issues who can't afford to have wigs or hairpieces.  Talk to your daughter, see if she would like to donate her hair to them!  <br>  <br>  And I think that should help with some of father's objection to having her hair cut.  Who can really argue with your 5 year old who wants to donate her hair so another little girl has hair???  It's a win win situation.<br>  <br>  I've placed a link to their website below.  My daughter in law is a hair stylist and has done some hair cuts for this group.  My husband has a ponytail and when he gets tired of dealing with it, he's going to donate his to them.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I would say "you can get your hair but only one inch". if she complains she shouldn't get anything.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	It's hair and it'll grow back, let her have some independence enough to choose how she wants her hair. If it's long enough she can even donate it to Locks of Love, a business that creates wigs for cancer patients.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Just get it cut.  It will grow back.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Hair grows back...|`|ENANtueuaa	My daughter wants the same thing, and she's also 5! How funny! She's always had really long hair, and for months has begged me to let her get it cut to her shoulders. What i'm doing is gradually cutting it shorter. My sister is a stylist, so she's been cutting off a few inches at a time every few weeks, we're not even half way to her shoulders yet...but that's what we all agreed on. I didn't want to just chop it off lol I just couldn't bear to do that! I don't think that would be spoiling her at all! She's starting to get an opinion, and that can be a good thing. As long as your ok with it, just talk to dad and explain that you just want to run it by him. Explain that she's getting older and wants a change. It's only hair and it will grow back if she doesn't like it. You can even do it gradually like us, if that would be easier on him. Good luck!
4AgjfQTnaa	If it always skips your generation then your chances of having twins are probably very low.|`|AA10186411	Twins usually only skip one generation but ok....The chances are good but not definite.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Fraternal twins are 1% shot. identicals are 1 in a million.    You must have a very detailed tree to know it skips 4 generations and pops up again...how many genertations do you know about??    Identical twins do not run in families. They are an anomoly. Fraternal twins do run in families and are passed down the females lines.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	You will have twins!|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	theres some chance. ask some science geek to make punett square, thatll give you some idea|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	In the U S, in 2000, there was 118,916 Twin Births and 6,742 Triplet Births, 506 Quadruplet Births, and 77 Quintuplets & Other Higher multiple Births. That is a 74 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. Since there were just over 4 million births in the US the  yr. 2000, about 3% of babies  born was a twin or higher multiple births. (triplets, quads, etc.), which are not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. So  your chance of having more than one baby at a time is  3% or 1 in 33. There are things that can increase your chances of having a multiple birth, including a mother being 30 or over when she conceives. For example, while there is a 3% chance of having a multiple birth at age 25-29, it increases to 4% at 30-34 years and almost 5% at 35-39 years.  Other factors that can increase your chances of having twins include having a maternal family history of multiple births (fraternal), and of course, using fertility treatments (in vitro fertilization or fertility drugs).  Your chance of having twins is also influenced by your race (multiples are more common in African Americans and least common in Hispanics and Asians), how many times you have been pregnant (the chance of having twins increases with each pregnancy), and whether or not you have had twins already. Keep in mind that statistics for birth rates and multiple births include all births, including those that were the result of fertility treatments and those that were natural. So if you don't have any of the factors mentioned above that can increase your chance of having multiples, your chance is going to be a little less than 3%. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20-25%!  Multiple birth rates of fraternal twins has been increasing the most. That means the chance of having fraternal twins is influenced by an advanced maternal age and the use of fertility treatment and chance of having identical twins has remained the same, about 0.4% or 1 in 250. I've had 4 children and i carried twins after my 2nd pregnancy but only 1 survived and he is 16 1/2 yrs now. and the last 2 pregnancies were single births.|`|43942bc50710c4456dc14871795e132baa	It also depends on your partners genetics. If they don't have twins in their family at all then your odds are slightly smaller. Plus if you have siblings the odds of all of you having twins is unlikely, so the gene normally only falls with one or two of the children in the family.
sKYmvXW7aa	I would just tell him again how you feel and insist on walking with him maybe every other Tuesday or something like that? that way its not all the time just one special time. Also, ask him how he'd feel if you were embarrassed to walk with him etc. He's only 11 and is getting to the age where they think they're supposed to be embarrassed around their parents. Don't be mad at him just explain yourself and  devise a plan.|`|paerqxfMaa	Let him be - you're going to make his life miserable because he doesn't want you to walk him to school??!!  What are you going to do when there's a real problem in a few years - he's going through puberty and adolescence!  Learn to pick your battles - if you get on him for every little thing, when it's really important and you need him to hear you, he will have already tuned you out.|`|AA11694281	Why do you expect a 5th grader to want to be walked to school. That is very rude and selfish if you say you wouldn't go to his soccer game. Be a parent and grow up, it seems like your child is more grown up than you. If you want to walk with him to school that bad then you should want to go to his soccer games just as bad and not use this as something to hold against him. Realize he is growing up and wants his space, it's going to happen. And walking him to school is not the end of the world.|`|mezX9Ao0aa	let him do his thang, maybe there is this broad he is trying to holla at, let him spit his game.|`|bezgko8Zaa	i understand that you guys have to respect eachother ~thats the way it should be. you have to understand that he is growing up and wants to have  his own independence. you can walk him to school but once you get there, go let him hang with his friends.|`|bELqEsdOaa	He doesn't want to make you feel bad or upset. He is just growing older and individualized. Most likely he is afraid that his friends will see him with his parents or Mom and Dad and he doesn't want his friends to think that he NEEDS you every second of the day. To be honest he does need you but it's a part of getting older. I got a little embarrassed when my parents would come to the school to drop something off for me. There was no reason for me to be embarrassed but something about having my Mommy and Daddy around made me uncomfortable with classmates. Don't be offended. A few years down the road he will realize that there is nothing to be embarrassed about. When he matures more surely he'll act more mature.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	As far as I can remember when I was that age, I didn't want my parents tagging along as I walked to the bus stop. Why can't you respect HIS wishes? This is about him - not you, your the adult and should realize he is nothing more than a child going through changes...probably some of the biggest he will. Why do you have you walk with him to school? Can't you arrange another time to have a walk together? Do something together on the weekends?   And it DOES sound like your trying to get revenge (which IS childish) when you say - "if you do not walk with me, I refuse to go to your soccer games..."   Who exactly is supposed to be setting examples for who here? Be the ADULT in the situation. You are whining because your son is growing up and chooses to exclude you in some of the things he does. You feel hurt. This is your own problem you have to deal with.|`|doizXjdDaa	It's hard being that age and his peers might pick on him if they think he's not allowed to walk to school alone, even if that is not the case. If he is mature and responsible enough to walk to school without supervision then let him do that. At that age one doesn't have many opportunities to be independent, so this might be important to him.    Not going to his soccer games is the worst thing you can do. Even using that as a threat is extremely low and immature of you. He is not going to respect you if you act like a child.    Ask yourself this - Why do you want to walk with your son? Is it important because you want to spend that time to bond with him. Or is it just a control issue?    If you want to walk with your son, ask him if he will take walks with you in the afternoon or on weekends.    PS - My parents used this exact threat against me when I was 15. I wouldn't go to church anymore, so they stopped taking me to my soccer games. Since I couldn't get to my games I had to quit and I haven't played since (or attended church.) I still have a grudge about it. Instead of taking away something that I loved and that was good for me, I think they should have given me motivation to go to church - say, If I went to church with the family every Sunday, I would earn another privilege that I had wanted. Instead I didn't go to soccer or church, and in the end nobody got what they wanted. Eight years later I'm still an atheist, and I can guarantee you this - Eight years from now your son will still not want to walk to school with you.|`|eLBKhYuNaa	I know you might feel really hurt by the fact that he doesn't want to walk with his dad. The thing isn't that he doesn't love you or respect you, but its about his appearance in front of his friends, he doesn't want to seem weak or coddled, he wants to show his friends that his parents are cool enough and trust him enough to let him walk alone. This is also the time that they will start thinking about going to middle school, getting older, and maybe even girls...so he has a lot on his plate now and he may not feel comfortable about it to share with you yet, but if u love him, and he you, he might begin to trust you more and talk to you. that's what you have to wait for.    another thing, you cannot compare your sons situation with when you were a child. it isn't the same. you grew up in a different time and his is growing up now. social norms have changed and social roles have changed as well. Also this situation is not about Obeying your parents...you said that in one of you later comments...but you didn't say so in your original post... do you really thing he is disobeying you? did you ask to walk with him or tell him that i will walk with you and you have to... i think your being a little insensitive yourself...    but there is another point, you want to spend time with your son. i would really suggest talking to him about it one day. he may not want to and u may feel uncomfortable, but that is the best thing. Also think that at some point you stopped walking with him and he got used to it, he began to like walking by himself, and/or he may have felt abandoned by you because you stopped walking with him. again talking really helps.    being a parent is hard and confusing at times. i know even though i am not a parent, i know what i have made my parents go through a lot. but try to understand what it was like for you...yea you did what your parents asked you but how did it feel.    Also, dint think your son doesn't love you, or spending time with you or doesn't respect you...he does, he is just growing up...      Pleasant be hurt by my comments...i just said what i thought. hope things work out.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Dad you have to realize he loves you very much. You have to realize he is in 5th. Grade and 11 years old. I am sure he would love to walk with you, but there is peer pressure involved here. He will and knows he will be branded as a sissy, when his peers find out. What I am trying to say is its not cool, if he gets caught.   It has nothing to do what so ever, about honor and respect. You don't have to live with his peers at school, but he does.  Never make him feel you do not love him because of this. Never stop going to a hockey game, soccer game or what  ever he plays. Do things with him he enjoys. Start a hobby together.  But never put him down, because he does not want to be seen with you walking to school. You talk about forgiving, well its time for you to forgive your son for this. Do you remember when he was born ? Well 11 years have gone by and I bet they have gone by fast.  Another 7 ( which is less than the 11 you have had with him ) he will be gone and in his place, there will be silence.  Never take your children for granted. Enjoy them, and hug them and tell then that you love them every day. Never push them away for any reason.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Clearly you are acting like a child, no wonder he doesn't want to be seen with you.    YOU may have been the perfect child but apparently he is normal.  And it is NORMAL for a child to want to distance themselves from their parents as they grow.  The fact that you don't realize that and impose your will on him anyway tells me that you have not finished growing emotionally.  That perhaps those walks with your parents and all the honor and respect you gave them has arrested your development in some way and turned you into a parent who's dependent upon their child for validation and emotional rescue.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	kill him|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	He wants to grow up Dad. The little guy is becoming a man and needs to learn to do things by himself. You have to live with it. Just keep an eye on him. Also, he may feel embarrassed to have his Dad take him to school.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	Mrs. B gave you this answer 6 hours ago when you asked this question and I pretty much agree with her:    let me just say that in my opinion, pulling the "if you loved me" card on a child - or anyone for that matter - is so wrong. the fact that he didn't want to walk with you has nothing at all to do with whether or not he loves you. he is a 5th grader. he is getting older and seeking more independence from you. he wasn't trying to hurt your feelings, he was trying to become his own person, and he has every right to be an individual and not just an extension of you. telling him that you don't want to go to his soccer games because of it is not going to make him see that you have feelings too. it is going to make him see that you are a manipulator, and cause a big rift between the two of you. he isn't a baby anymore, let him be a big boy!  5 hours ago|`|JdqDauEDaa	I don't understand your question.     I wasn't upset when my parents wanted to be with me when I was in 5th grade. I didn't get embarrased until around 7th or 8th but I sucked it up and did it anyway because I respected my parents and wasn't given the option of not having them there with me.    It's one thing to be embarrased by your parents during your teen years and it's another thing to allow your 10 year old CHILD to dictate who walks to school with him.  Who has the control in the house? Your son or you? I understand your position and I also know from personal experience that being vindictive by not going to his soccer games or by telling him you won't go then not following through and going is a surefire way to lose his respect. (It was the same way for my father who tried to bribe me and threaten me through my teen years). I lost respect for him and turned to my mother for discipline.     To answer your question-or what I think you are asking-you opened up a can of worms when you allowed him the freedom to walk to school alone. He has this freedom now. If you would like to accompany him to school, you have to remind him that you are his father and that he is not to talk back to you. You will walk where you like and when you like. Schedule some father-son time when the two of you can bond and ALWAYS follow through on your promises and NEVER threaten or be vindictive to your child. Remember-your son is learning from your actions.|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	its just him growing up, going through that "if im seen with my dad, ill never live it down" as time goes on he'll realize youre there.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	He's growing up. He now probably understand that image effects popularity and having your mom or dad walk you to school hurts your image. He's not 6 anymore, and as he gets older there's going to be more stuff he wants to do alone. Once he starts driving, it'll seem like that if it wasn't for money, he wouldn't need you. Just make it a point for him to always eat dinner with his family or to do something family related often. Family game nights or movie nights are fine when kids are younger, but at his age he's too old for that. He wants some space and needs it to grow up and mature.    All parents go through this. My parents probably felt the same way when I told them I didn't want them coming with me to college on my first trip up. There's just some things that he's going to prefer to do on his own. It has nothing to do with his perception of you.    Don't take it personally. It's part of him growing up.|`|3vBALAlaaa	I'm sorry that your hurt, but I understand where he's coming from. I think that it's simply a pre-adolescence phase, and that you shouldn't take it to heart. I know that back in the day, it was a lot simpler, but in today's time, people are scared of not being accepted to the point where they won't believe in God, my savior and Lord, because he's not "Cool." I am ashamed of my generation's behavior, but you have to also understand that he's a kid, but one of God's wishes is to have free will, so I think that you should tell your son that you care about him no matter what, but you don't understand why he doesn't want to walk with you. Let him feel equal. Kids don't like to be treated like little babies, especially at 11. GL, God Bless You|`|MLPzeOtOaa	He is just trying to assert his independence. It IS embarrassing for a kid to be walked to school, at that age, by his dad. RESPECT HIS FEELINGS! you have had discussions about that, right?!?!?!    And I'm sorry, sir, but telling him you dont want to go to his soccer games because he does not want you to walk him to school IS BEING CHILDISH!     Maybe you could have a time to walk later in the day, just the 2 of you. But for that time of day, let it go! Do you WANT to embarrass him? If, so, you are being selfish. You dont have to be with him for the rest of the school day when kids are making fun of him because he is a baby or a daddy's boy.    I'm sorry if you don't agree with other people's opinions on this site. Maybe next time ask in a venue where people might not have differing opinions. Good luck with that!!!      **Just pick a time, later in the day, when the two of you can walk together. One that doesn't involve anyone else, so it is  a special time for just the 2 of you**|`|AA10093245	He's just getting to that age where kids want to try their wings, feel some independence. It has nothing to do with his feelings for you, it has more to do with exploring his own feelings and coming into autonomy. Of course it hurts. But I would recommend respecting his feelings, it will help him realize his feelings are valid and you respect them. Ask him to walk with you at another time, or do other father/son activities that he likes.  don't worry too much if other people on this forum say things, because you have to "consider the source".  Your son will respect and love you even more if you let him learn his independence. I remember in 8th grade asking my mom to drop me off on the second corner, I didn't want my friends to even know I HAD any parents, LOL. Now my mom is deceased, and I wish I had those times back, but all that comes with maturity.|`|ON84EQaBaa	if he go that close to school let him go, are there gangs or bullies brothering him? hes 11 years old he thinks he a big boy and can go without a parent following him. I understand he's yours but just sit back & relax! When he leave in the morning give him love, when he come give him love but let him learn how to be responsobly & gain so indenpendance. He'll be ok!|`|lsrjbjk3aa	he's 11 he soesn't really need his parents walk with him don't u think he's a growing boy.my 'rents let me walk 2 school around 11 cuz they trust me.but make sure he has a walking buddy just 2 be on the safe side:]]u should trust ur son|`|FUKyjY0baa	Hes just growing up. Maby he thinks that if everone else's parents aren't bringing there child in that he would be teased. Or he might be meeting up with some one or a group of friends.|`|sDHxandWaa	I think you need to realize that your kid is growing up and doesn't want to walk to school with you. Respect his wishes.
wl7tlYOYaa	I wouldnt recommend this because I havent not personally been through this but after a c-section because of the scar on the uterus there is a hight risk or uterine rupture, which basically entails you uterine walls tearing and your baby can move to your chest cavity. Risk for the mother: uterus removal, hemorredge, infertility, not being able to carry a a baby full term. Risk for the baby: death. Am defo not trying to scare u but I was watching a show on TV about this so I did some research and these are the risk u take when u want to do this. It doesnt happen to everyone, but it is a risk. Good luck.
5yuqCzUmaa	Perhaps your subconscious really, REALLY wants a baby and thinks that you (or perhaps your husband) are infertile??<br>  I'd go to a fertility clinic thingy and check.|`|AA10315814	When I was pregnant, I dreamed that my husband was pregnant too, and I was elated.<br>  <br>  I think that you want a baby and since your husband is the closest to you, it made sense that you saw him pregnant|`|CsjR9Vwsaa	Sweetie that dream may not mean anything. Me and my husband have been married for 2 years and we just recently found out we are expecting our first child in may of 2009. I had endometrosis and everything and thought i could not get pregnant. Make a appointment with your OBGYN and see what resources she/he may have. I know this can be very frustating when you are wanting a child. but what i can tell you from what my family and friends told me is to stop trying to hard ( and yes i know it sounds easier than it really is) enjoy one another in your passion of the moment ( per say) and leave it in God's hands. That is what me and my husband did. If you ever need any one to talk to just send me and message and i will be glad to talk to you anytime sweetie

EWDSI8P2aa	Yeah, that is really odd, and unusual :S<br>  <br>  I don't mean to criticize your parents methods of parenting and all but personally I think they are way to overprotected and worried about you. except as said above, the bed time one is fairly fine and normal ;)<br>  <br>  Maybe something in their past has lead for them to behave like this? Either way I suggest you talk to them and tell them how they are being to over protective/cautious and you just want a little bit of space, maybe they don't even know? No harm in asking.<br>  <br>  In my opinion..:<br>  <br>  1 weeks notice is way too much, maybe 1 day max, a few hours would be fine as long as I knew where you were going. And total direct supervision - I'd say you're old enough to look after yourself at that age, as long as you are with your friends etc. <br>  <br>  You mum must meet and discuss with your parents friends first - way too much imo. Fair enough meeting your friends first, I could say that is okay, or even just talking to the parents on the phone? possibly a bit too much but meeting with them and discussing it all - too overprotective/worried imo.<br>  <br>  I am not allowed to be home alone for more than a half hour or walk outside without permission - Fairly<br>  <br>   acceptable, I can understand these rules although some would call them a little harsh, although I'd say you should be allowed outside by yourself with permission if you aren't already. <br>  <br>  i am not allowed to get anyhing below straight a's.  - Quite ridiculous to be honest if you ask me. Your parents should be supporting you to try your best and do the best you can and work to your full potential. Not telling you you must get Straight A's otherwise you're a failure. For some people that is quite simply not possible, even if they work to their full potential.<br>  <br>  As I've said earlier, you should have a word with your parents and tell them the truth, how you're feeling - that they are too overprotective/worried and you aren't getting your freedom that you need.<br>  <br>  But try not to come over aggressive, maybe you can sort something out that would be good for both of you :)<br>  <br>  GL!|`|qzTq9HsEaa	LOL! im allowed to go out with 5 minutes notice and not even say where im going, and sleep at my friends house with just a phonecall to my mum informing her, and my parents arent reckless or anything, theyre doctors.<br>  so yeah that is really wierd,<br>  talk to heer about it and ask her what her real worries are, and try to reassure her that your safe,<br>  maybe get her to give you a curfew, even an early one, but you have to abide by it, and thats how she'll learn to trust you, hopefully she''ll loosen up :)|`|zrBzRYI8aa	Thats not that bad my brother are 14 and 15 and my step mom still wants to meet there friends and the parents and know what they will be doing and who will be there. A weeks notice maybe your mom just likes to plan things ahead. And my brothers go to bed at 9:45 no questions asked. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should try talking to your mom, asking her if there are things you can do around the house to show her you are more responsible, and as your pick up responsibility's these will maybe help your mom trust you more. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|gOT71K6Yaa	whoa sounds like she is trying to control you. well my bed time is 930 and im 15. lol but i dont mind im very tired by that time. well if you dont like this, talk to your mom. tell her that you should be allowed to do certain things. start of small, like letting you sleep at 10. and let her know why. i think a great reason as to why she should let you is because you get straight a's. well hope i helped.|`|ZPPLvHDaaa	Wow.<br>  Im 13, and my life's nothing like that.<br>  I can walk outside....go to the mall without notice weeks before....my mom doesnt have to meet them....<br>  <br>  AHH!<br>  Have fun!<br>  :)|`|8cde6a9b3d68585f596d52e029b8c3f0aa	thats pretty weird.... your parents are REALLY strict...|`|ACSEVjYCaa	It is quite common unfortunately, some 16 year olds have the same problem. Some parents are too over protective and that is NOT a good thing. At that age it is important to be able to socialize. Social skills are important for when you get older and its best to start developing them around your age. I never had that kind of problem; my mom didn't approve of me going to parties and certain friend's houses but she didn't try to stop me.|`|GslmgvtOaa	Tell your mom that you want a little more freedom like taking a walk to the park hanging out with out having to have your mom meet their mom your 14 and you deserve the freedom and prove to mom that you are responsible and wont do anything crazy with your friends and btw i go to bed at 10:30 but my friend goes to bed at 8:00 but that's because she has a weird sleeping pattern.|`|GyQ4w192aa	Hey im 12 and i go bed at 12:50 so it is a bit strange for your mom to be doing that. Anyway no its not normal i was allowed from one end of my town to the other at 10 so yes it is VERY strange.<br>  <br>  you have to convince your mom that you responsible and just say to her that you need your own personal time and that if she needs you your only a call away (if you have a cell phone) and its normal to tell your parents where your going so enyway fanx for listening<br>  <br>  Courtney x..x.x..|`|9TiL7fjCaa	that is weird..ive never heard of that before....maybe theres something in her life thats making her overprettective of you...but it seems like aside from that your okay ..i do realize that it is really hard living under someones thumb and living a life that is strict and at times feels like its not your own. But take a deep breath and remember that it wont be like that forever and that you are 14 and will be on your own soon. right now it is kinda easy...so relish that while you can|`|tUuOyvngaa	Every parent is different. They are just trying to keep you safe. I know it seems like a pain... but as you get older I promise it will get better.

I have no father, I look like a mess, the girl and guy that I like are both going out with other people, I consider myself a loser, I don't have many friends, my family has no money, I have a lot of very stressful school work and I have more than most people do, I have maths and science exams in March, my family can't afford a car, I only have 3 people in my family that care about me, I'm lonely, everyone thinks I'm a loser because I don't smoke or drink, but do you know what I do? I get over it and try and improve on things.     Your best mate fell out with you, so what? I would fall out with you to if I was that friend because you seem like a very bratty person. You look like a mess; exercise, wash daily, buy things to improve your skin and hair. You say you're a loser; loser's get further in life because they concentrate on important things like school instead of parties and drinking. You cry at school, so have most people. You don't want to live, then don't. As far as I'm concerned, don't live if you're going to moan about it because other people have it 100 times worse than you.

AA11142889	<a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/GFCFKids/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/GFC...</a> Very active group, with some people who have a lot of experience with the GFCF and other natural treatment.<br>  <br>  My son has been GFCF for over 15 years.  He feels better when he stays GFCF, which is why he still follows the diet at college.<br>  <br>  There are various reasons why a person might need to eliminate gluten (the protein that's in grains like wheat) and casein (the protein that's in milk).  These include true allergies, celiac disease, and a problem with how the body breaks down the proteins that results in toxic by-products called gliadorphin and casomorphin.  These substances are naturally occurring opioids and are related to substances such as heroin.<br>  <br>  According to data collected by the Autism Research Institute, parents rate the GFCF diet as more effective at reducing autistic behaviors than any of the common medications being given to people with autism.|`|rSRrvXeCaa	My son also has autism,  we don't use this diet but what exactly are you confused about? and by the way,  i don't feel sorry for you ;) we love our children!!!|`|jLYTKr33aa	I don't have a child with autism.  However, a friend of mine has a son on the spectrum, and he is on the diet.  He can't have any dairy products or wheat.  Sorry, I can't really answer any more without further information from you.<br>  By the way, I don't feel sorry for you.  I'm sure the fact that your son has autism doesn't affect how wonderful he is, and that you're extremely proud of him.  Have fun with your little guy.  |`|qEN5i6S9aa	I'm sorry that someone feels sorry for you.  Are you thinking of having your son try the diet?  Was he tested for any other medical disorders, such as Celiacs?  I've seen some children on the diet and it has worked well.  Just make sure that if you're going to switch him to this new food lifestyle that he is still getting his other forms of therapy.  I would say that if you have further questions, check out the websites posted previously and to talk with other parents via Stop Autism Now and CARD (Cener for Autism and Related Disorders, Inc).<br>  <br>  Rosanita Ratcliff<br>  |`|c1c0e4322e67e6f7dd7a4e7eed6054daaa	My son is 2 and will be 3 in January.

mDy6L6uraa	Your son probably won't realize it is him, he will think it is just another baby.  Children typically don't develop the ability to recognize themselves (self-awareness) until around 18 months.<br>  <br>  Apparently there are some old wives' tales that have to do with babies and mirrors.  One just says "Babies should never look into a mirror until after their first birthday." and another is more specific, stating "A baby should never be shown its own reflection before it is a year old, else it will stutter or grow no bigger than it is or die before it turns one."  This may be a belief your grandma grew up with, but unless you're extremely superstitious, I wouldn't give it too much credit.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	It was always safe for him to look in mirrors. What urban myth is this saying babies shouldn't?|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	why wouldn't it be? my son ha since he could focus straight- i would tell him that it was him in there- a very handsome boy. he owuld laugh at himself|`|LhvKTYftaa	lol...no its fine!!  Grandma is repeating some ollld wivestales!!  my mil does that, ie.  dont measure your hands to someone elses, the devil will get you!!  WHHHAT??  (she seriously says that too)<br>  the little guy is the perfect age fofr mirrors, they love them at this age.  We always told my son (and still do) that "baby in the mirror" wants to play!!  He tries to "free" the baby in the mirror, but the stubborn bugger will never come out and play!!  lol..<br>  it is actually good for them, and will cause no harm (especially "dumbness").  <br>  <br>  also...I forgot, his swing has a mirror on it above him, it came that way!!|`|hkQSqPEwaa	is he that ugly.<br>  Just joking.<br>  no it ok to look in the mirror.  i never heard of that,|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	Why wouldn't it be?  I've never heard of it being bad for a baby.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I hope so- I let my 5 month old do it everyday. He loves it!|`|dYmMPFVCaa	No, I've known several people who have either had allergic reactions to the chemicals that make mirrors shine or have been burned by the strong amount of light concentrated on them. Best to keep him away, or make him wear sunglasses when he does.|`|79ab050dbcc8861f2c6be1d80f755328aa	yes, there's nothing wrong with that. just watch that he doesn't break one while at it, he might cut himself.|`|Wl7SEg1aaa	I think it would be okay? I don't know why it wouldn't be okay.|`|AA11113671	babys love their reflection!|`|R6tmZFCDaa	Of course.  Why wouldn't it be safe?|`|SOXoueR2aa	Are you kidding? Why would it be dangerous for him to look in the mirror?|`|ac5gX7sNaa	Sure, why not?|`|TwGTYU6gaa	ur stupid|`|7c5ex252aa	That's some strange advice from your grandma!!  haha  My first baby looked in the mirror all the time, he loved to see himself and always smiled, and he's seriously one of the smartest 3 year olds I know!  My 5 month old has been looking in the mirror ever since he could see more than 2 feet in front of him, and he's developing fine.  Let your baby look in the mirror, you'll love the smiles they give you in return, plus I imagine they like looking at themselves.  The only thing that I would think would ever make your baby 'dumb' is not giving him lots of love and attention.  Also, read to your baby every night, helps develop their brains.  good luck!|`|9bCa2DUTaa	Of course! My so have looked in mirrors since he was...3 months! It's good, to help him recognized him self. And it help him realize about his existence early. Just make sure that the mirror is safe for children, i mean, it's a toy mirror, so it won't risk an injury to ur baby. |`|GhBHK1Nbaa	Absolutely.  I wouldn't deprive my baby of such harmless exploration just because of a silly myth.<br>  I was born into a very superstitious culture and have always been resistant to such BULL.|`|iyvG1igSaa	yes as long as there isnt a too bright glare because you dont want to hurt his eyes so make sure it isnt right by a light little kids like looking in mirrors. they make cribs with mirrors in them too|`|PNNkEeBlaa	I doubt so many baby toys would be allowed to have mirrors on them if it wasn't safe.|`|ZqlLyEYBaa	My Daughter has from the minute she had her eyes open and could focus.

k3V2CA81aa	A woman is fertile during the middle of her cycle. So, about a week and a half to 2 weeks after her period she can get preggo. You will not get preggo having sex a few days before your period. You would have already ovulated by then. Most women are not fertile right after their period unless they have really short cycles (less than 21 days). |`|11FQyeakaa	after. b/c your shedding the lining in your uterus and i believe the egg gets released 12-16 days after the start of your period. |`|IKW6dkvkaa	i believe a woman is more fertial when she is on her period because its easier for the sperm to reach the egg..but i wouldnt know for sure you might want to double check with someone who studies this stuff for a living|`|kLtI1z15aa	Well, you are most fertile a week or two before your period. It is when you ovulate. <br>  You could have gotten pregnant at either time. Hopefully you had a condom on though!|`|NNwEuC8paa	Better chance on it happening after. BUT it COULD happen before.|`|rJHFrZXBaa	after
RQPqbpxVaa	One of the most common causes of period-like bleeding during pregnancy is called decidual bleeding. Sometimes, during pregnancy, your body’s hormones can get out of whack, causing you to lose parts of the lining of your uterus. This is especially common in the early stages of pregnancy, before the lining has completely attached to the placenta. While it can be troublesome to think about shedding part if your uterine lining, decidual bleeding is generally not thought to be a health threat to you or your baby.<br>  |`|FLOjzbKEaa	You can't.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Well a period during pregnancy isn't a real period. I bled in the first couple of months, it resembled a period but it was from behind my uterus and luckily didn't effect our baby. There's a lot of blood flowing around 'down there' when you're pregnant so it's pretty easy to bleed if you aren't careful - and sometimes even when you ARE careful. There are cases when women continue to bleed monthly through their pregnancy but like I said, it's not a real period.<br>  <br>  And I totally agree - not having your period for so long is AWESOME! lol|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Well, technically it is not a period, it is bleeding. 
zumJLLthaa	Not that I know of either.  Everyone thought I was having a boy and it's a girl.  People say carrying low and high mean one or the other but I always hear it different ways.  You don't have much longer before the dr. will tell you though.  It goes by faster than you think.  Congratulations!|`|aNsv0PPnaa	no there is no way except scan wich isnt 100pre cent. the wedding ring test was accurate for me though.xx|`|uQ0MpWVaaa	Nope none at all, the size and shape of your tummy is a myth, i had 2 boys and am almost 32 weeks with a girl, theres absolutely NO difference!

Sometimes even an ultrasound is wrong. I looked up some websites just trying to figure out what color my babies eyes will be or hair color.

Nothing-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING-is 100 per cent effective against pregnacy other than complete abstinence. Contrary to what the poster above me said, you cannot sue your doctor or the company because you acknowledge that it is not 100 per cent effective. If you got pregnant on te pill or shot it would be no different. . I got preggo on nuvaring. My son was not even 6 months old at the time. However, you do need to go the doc as ectopic pregnancy is a very real possibilty with Mirena and any other IUD and they disclose that in their medical pamphlet. Legally, they have themselves covered. But just go to the doc ASAP. They will need to check your tubes.<br>  <br>  EDIT-But if the above poster was pregannt when the doc put it in, which could be possible looking at her dates I can see, then suing could definitely be a possibilty! You (above poster) better make sure your dates are right. With twins you could look up to two weeks less pregnant than you actually are because everything is split between two embryos. You may have been preggo when he or she put that thing in!

Good Luck!|`|ba4500039e8f92604ce593a1896685dbaa	I'm not sure you'd feel pegnancy pain under your rib cage this early .. I would more think you'd feel lower stomach pain / lower back pain.  You should def. consult a doctor .. If you've aleady missed your period you should take an HPT to be sure your pregnant, so at least when you see a doctor you'll be able to tell him symptoms your having.  good luck!
M1KYxcvSaa	Fenugreek is good as is pumping between feedings.  But also keep in mind that your baby is much more efficient at getting milk than a breast pump.  He's probably getting more than you realize.  Try to be relaxed when you are nursing him and let him suckle for as long as he wants.  The more he sucks, the more milk you will produce.  See if you can go a whole day without supplementing.  Every time you give him a bottle, that's time not spent at the breast encouraging milk to come in.  Just make sure to take him to his checkups and monitor his weight gain.  If he's not getting enough, his growth levels will tell you pretty quickly and the Dr will advise you if you need to supplement.  |`|AA10719402	fenugreek capsules.<br>  <br>  Eating oatmeal.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com</a>|`|avx7bLnKaa	with breastfeeding you need to feed on demand... as often for as long as the baby wants [yes this can be a pain in the butt]<br>  by continually supplementing with formula you are actually hurting your milk supply... hopsitals recomment this and they did this to me too with my first son.... you should have been told to at least stop supplementing once your milk came in around day 4 after birth...<br>  <br>  a nursing baby nurses very very frequently... sometimes spending 5-30 mins on each breast and then accepting to other breast only to nurse an hr later...<br>  this does not mean you aren't making enough milk... this means breast milk is easily digestible and baby is hungry again or thirsty or wants to comfort suck...<br>  you need to be soley/only breastfeeding if you want your milk supply to grow...<br>  nurse you baby for as long as he wants ... empting one breast before starting another... then use  a pump unti lafter you are pumping dry... this will help build your supply...<br>  <br>  a pump doesn't get out as much as the baby will so pumped milk is not a good indicator of how much milk you are making...<br>  <br>  I'd suggest if you want to continue nursing you stop supplementing with formula or slowly your milk  will totaly disappear before you are ready to stop...<br>  <br>  you need to nurse on demand and stop formula... yes your baby may not "act" as content 30 minutes after feeding because breastmilk digests easier than formula.. formula stays in the belly longer..[this is not equated or equal to a better solution]<br>  <br>  you can tell if your baby is getting enough milk if your baby has at least 5-6 wet diapers a day and gaining weight<br>  <br>  call a lactation consultant at your hopsital or through la leche league<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBmilksupplyissues.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBmilksupplyissue...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBearlyweeks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBearlyweeks.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T022600.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T022600...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T022700.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T022700...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/index....</a>|`|8lcNupM2aa	That was a ridiculous reason for them to tell you to supplement. <br>  15 minutes per breast is not much for a newborn. He should be nursing much longer and usually they will still nurse as they are sleeping.  It will take a little while for your milk supply to build up but I suggest limiting the amount you are supplementing and just trying to nurse as often as you can.  Your body will produce more milk soon.  If you keep supplementing there is a chance your body won't produce as much milk. That happened to me.<br>  <br>  Also, you might want to keep him on one breast at a time per feeding. Don't switch breasts during a feeding because then he won't be able to get the hind milk, which is thicker and more nutritious and comes in after the fore milk (the first bit of milk coming out).  If he gets more hind milk he'll stay fuller.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11119076	The drug Reglan can be used to increase milk supply if you are in the USA- Canada has a better one (domperidone? something that starts with a "d") that doesn't have the side effects.  You should probably talk to a lactation consultant because normally people advise just getting rid of the formula and nursing on demand (normally your milk supply will adjust quickly to accommodate this) but since your baby was early that may not be advisable. |`|0O9S3Sjraa	Yes fenugreek really helps. Also dont worry at all, u r doing perfectly fine. U will be amazed how fast the milk supply will develop from 1.5 Oz to good quantities in a few days on its own. Just dont stress over it. Avoid stress and tensions of any kind. <br>  I too had the same thing with my daughter and my Mom told me to avoid stress and enjoy and thats all that works. Just take care of ur diet and enjoyyyyyy. :)|`|biKYAlmFaa	I have had similar supply problems caused by the doctor giving me the wrong antibiotics...i cant express very well cause my body seems to be used to the baby's way of sucking...i found drinking lots of water (8 pints or more) and just latch baby on whenever you can, it will only take a day or two...try to reduce (slowly) the amount of formula your baby gets and only top up when you need to.....other than that express in the morning and evening and try to do it in the bath, you will be more relaxed. Don't expect to express too much, its still early days, my baby is 9 weeks and i maybe get 2 or 2 1/2 oz out of each but its richer than formula....you also let down twice so allow up to 30 Min's on each breast. I must be doing something right as my little girl puts on a pound each 10 days....relax and persevere you will feel so proud
PKQv6ML2aa	Yay! This is one of my favorite subjects! I think that the parents are 75 percent reasonsable for the spoiled child. I grew up as one of the richest kids in the neighborhood. But, when I grew up my parents were always at work, we had a nanny, I still went to school. I wasn't really aware that I was rich, because my parents don't spend their money on material things. When I grew up, I still got grounded ( but I was a good kid, so it wasn't to often) , I didn't get an allowance, I still had to say my prayers and the 'magic words' and maintain my grades. Then we moved to a place were everyone's parents were doctor, buisnessmen, and good jobs. I watched as kids 13 and 14 had all these designer clothing, and fancy phones. I was one of those kids who wore the same clothes over and over, and I didn't have a fancy phone. I knew I had just as much money, but my parents put it for their retirement and  college fund. I grew up trying not to be overly mature. <br>  Well, that was rant.<br>  Lets get to your questions<br>  - I think that when it comes to a car, parents pay for the car and insurance, but gas is all the teenager<br>  -I think when it comes to clothes or a shopping spree, the parents pay, but the kids have to really work for it<br>  -Teens should get allowance if they deserve it<br>  -They are less prepared because they won't have daddy their whole life<br>  - I think teens should have a phone at middle school to keep in touch with thier parents, but kids don't need the iPhone<br>   <br>  Well, that was fun to answer<br>  STAR!|`|4TvpYnwmaa	I believe you're adults and teenagers are spoiled if they don't appreciate what they have. As a teenager myself, I believe we all should have a job... Not only does the extra money make us more independent, but it's never too early to start earning money.|`|8IoNq7dVaa	Technically all american teenagers are spoiled in many ways compared to the rest of the world which is really poor,<br>  The teenager isn't spoiled if his parents pay for his things as long as he does something in return like grades or chores, or saving up for college|`|T6qMEtlhaa	Keep in mind that these are all based on what I think is generally true but i'm sure there are exceptions.<br>  Okay here we go...<br>  Yes, I thin kthat there are many different levels of being spoiled and being a little spoiled is okay but too much is too much.  I think a spoiled teen does act differently... they want everyone to do everything for them and are selfish.<br>  - The teen should pay for the car, or some of it  at least.  Or even borrow  or be given their parents old car.  Parents should pay for insurance and kids should pay for gas.<br>  - Parents should meet there kids half way on stuff they don't need and pay for what they do need.<br>  -Less prepared because they don't know how to take care of themselves.  But, if they have enough money, I guess they don't need to.<br>  -The parents should pay for the cell phone if the teen only uses it for short conversations but if they talk on it all the time and text like 24/7, the teen should pay.  Extra clothes maybe half and half.  Computer I think the parents should buy when the teen goes to college.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|af72ec9ad370c45c22d1958b71bbe8b2aa	A spoiled teenager is demanding and a pain in the neck.<br>  But it is not her/his fault but the parents.<br>  Parents now a days do not know that discipline means that you love a kid.|`|qz12lsh7aa	There are different levels of spoiledness, there is the spoiled brat one, brags all the time, thinks they deserve everything and then the reasonable spoiled, have a work ethic but still get lots of nice practical things.  <br>  I am the second version of spoiled and will answer these questions according to what my parents buy me and my opinion.<br>  -Who should pay for the car? The insurance? The gas? All parents, this is a reasonable thing so that I can get around town because my parents are really busy and there is no other way, like friends with cars, buses and stuff<br>  -Should parents buy their teens things, or meet them halfway on certain saving objectives?  I think that parents should give teens a large allowance and let them pick what they want to spend it on but if it is something big and they can explain why they should have it, then the parents should pay<br>  -Should teenagers get an allowance? Yes I think my allowance of 110 dollars is very reasonable, allows me to save up and learn how to budget and that way I don't have to rely on my parents for everything, just big things and then have parents buy lots of christmas and birthday presents<br>  -Do you think teenagers who are spoiled are more or less prepared for the real world? (Consider that they are better equipped for it, despite being less ready to face its economic, social challenges etc.)  It depends I think I am more so than other people because I have learned how to budget, but overly spoiled kids are definitely less prepared<br>  -Who should buy extra things for teenagers (Cell phone, extra clothes, computer?) Do teenagers really need these things?  I think that parents should pay for a cell phone and computer because those are necessities, a cell phone is really necessary because what if something happens or they need a ride and a laptop is necessary for school, I use mine for every class and all the time and at my school almost everything is technology based, Clothes I think that parents should pay for some clothes, back to school shopping, birthdays, christmas, but for every day clothes the child should use their allowance for those things<br>  Hope I helped

Xc02z608aa	there is always the risk of pregnancy, but taking your pill a few hours late really isn't that big of a deal.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.|`|AA12088252	What pills?  Birth control pills are supposed to be taken every day, around the same time.....   If you took your BCPs a few hours after your regular time BUT have been taking them consistently for at least a month, you "should" be fine.....<br>  <br>  However, if you have NOT been taking regular BCPs and took some last night as a preventative measure, your chances of pregnancy are pretty much the same as anyone else not taking BCPs and depends on where you are in your cycle.  If you're within the two weeks after your last period and before your next period, you have a higher chance of getting pregnant, but of course, time will tell.   <br>  <br>  I wouldn't stress too much about it.... this can cause you to actually be late and that would only add more stress to your plate!|`|E6PWwRa6aa	there is a chance<br>  every hour you missed taking your pill the chances get higher. A few hours you should be O.K but look for signs of pregnancy if you are not close to getting your period. Also you could take ECP (emergency contraceptive pill) found at planned parenthood, you can take the pill up to 48 hours after having unprotected sex.|`|q5yj2Fpsaa	when i got my birth control the dr told me that if i am a few hours late that was ok and that if i was a day late it was still ok just to make sure i kept taking them on time everyday i think you are ok dont worry the pill should be still in your system even if you are a few hours or a day late. Some pills keep you from getting pregnant for about a month after you take them depending on how long you took them the medicine is still in your system.|`|eKX4rm1Taa	I would def. take a test just to ease your mind. There *could* be a chance you are pregnant.|`|kFfMV0Tiaa	takke a testt; bestt wayy too kknow
f414c39c058877d6335bca8b6bb85a45aa	I was 17 when I got pregnant with a boy I barely knew.  My daughter is going to be 15 in a few weeks and the best thing I ever did.  When I told my parents I thought my mother and step-father would kick me out of the house and my father would love me unconditionally.  My mother was "disappointed" but they supported me.  My father said "abortion" immediately, even knowing I had always been against it. Now, 15 years later, both my parents love her dearly.  Her father was never in the picture and allowed my husband to adopt her.  It was very tough but we made it through.  <br>  <br>  As far as the father of the baby, you need to tell him first.  If he wants to be in you and the babies life (don't depend on it) he should be there when you tell you parents, unless you think your parents will get violent with him.<br>  <br>  Try not to listen to the mean replies saying you should have never had sex in the first place.  You are your own person and have made your decisions (good or bad).  Be proud of the person you are but realize you will be caring for another life soon and everything you do you will need to think how it will effect this child, if you keep the baby.<br>  <br>  I am a firm believer in things happening for a reason.  My daughter made me the person I am today.  I had to work harder to provide for her but it made me a better person.  Good luck with everything.  I know you have a lot to think about.  Please message me anytime if you need someone to talk to.  I am MUCH older then you but I have been there.|`|2ad181c21364a9bc452bc03d80d57598aa	Have the father come over, and tell him and ask him to be with you when you tell your parents. I am sure your mom will be upset at first, but she will be more understanding then you think. just let the father know that you are going to keep it (I'm just assuming) If I were you, I would tell the boy you slept with, and then have his parents and your parents together and just talk to them. good Luck hon.. <br>  <br>  and yes you should have used protection, but what is done is done and no need for everyone to give you grief about it. and don't let anyone tell you have have an abortion, I have friends who had babies in high school, and hell yes it is hard. but they tell me know that they're adults that they are so happy they kept it.  abortion is not always the damn answer as some people seem to think. there are adoptions, open adoptions where you can still see the child grow up. you could keep the baby and you and your parents could raise the baby. I know a lot of people think that it's a burden on the parents. but a lot of parents would rather help raise there grandchildren then nothing at all. again. good luck.|`|qWGYMZrgaa	i was 15 when i got pregnant, and i was 16 when i had my child, and it was hard to tell the father, who was my ex boyfriend and my friend, he is there for our child, who is now 1 years old, telling my dad was hard, but i got my doc to do it for me, maybe you could do that? but other then that, you NEED to tell them. |`|0xEFagAVaa	They will find out eventually. Be honest and up front about it. It happened now you have to own up to it. Go to the doctor and find out for sure whether before you tell them or with them. Maybe you need them to know you are sexually active and need to be put on the pill if you aren't pregnant. There are a lot of std's out there. Be careful.|`|1W4ILxf7aa	Oh honey, it will all be ok!  Every baby is good news.  You are only 16 though, and you should really think about giving it up for adoption.  There are so many families that could afford to take the financial responsibility and time to care for a baby.  You can always opt for an open adoption and still be able to see the baby.<br>  The first thing you need to do is definitely tell the father and discuss your options.  PLEASE don't have an abortion.<br>  Then, discuss with your parents.  I promise they will be more accepting and understanding than you think right now.<br>  Best of luck!|`|JBR5GJYkaa	well im 15 and my son was due yesterday...anyways i told my mom first because she is less strict than my dad and also she is kind of a air head....so i told her first....then i told my dad...i am very mature for my age so they gave me the decision to either keep my child or not...i chose to keep it....i showed then i was going to do better for myself and i did....finished the school year with straight A's which i have never done! what you need to do before you go to your parents is to make a list of the good and bad things to having a baby so young...and you also need to decide what you want to do before you go to them!! good luck!! email me if you want to!<br>  qteepeye2004@yahoo.com |`|MlJLzX8Xaa	If you have a decent relationship with the father, tell him and have him come with you and tell your parents together.<br>  If not, talk to your mother and she could help you tell the father.<br>  You need to tell your mother, get some medical attention.

If your strongly against it, have the baby and give it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  C. If you want to see the child occasionaly, make sure its a open adoption.|`|epixtzLDaa	you can get everyone together,  tell them your pregnant   Then leave them to talk about it and come back when they are finished and hope there not going to be TOO angry !!!<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|IOxCtktJaa	"Everyone who's daughter isn't pregnant step forward. Ooooh! Not so fast Mom and Dad!"|`|Ammq2OqMaa	first of all, you shouldn't have "made" the baby in the first place. What's done is done however, everybody makes mistakes, but most of them aren't that big. However I'll try not to judge, and here's what you can do. Try to find your mom when she is in a good mood, don't let her be mad or she will get madder, don't find her when she is too overjoyed or you will ruin the moment. If that doesn't come soon, just wait a little bit, don't tell her too late or she will be all mad at you tell her that you sould have done it earlier.When you tell you mom tell her in a peaceful manner, not too histrung and not too sad. Tell you mom that you with to discuss it in a peaceful matter, tell her that everybody makes mistakes and that yours was a big one and that you lost your proper judgement when it happened. Tell her that you will be more responsible and tell her that you won't be knocked up again. (if you don't know it means that you get pregnant if you're not married.) If I were you go with what your mom thinks is right, but please I'm begging you to not go for abortion, it's a sad thing even if the baby was a mistake. If you really can't handle it and you're not willing to make to many sacrifices, you will have to do something that will haunt you for the rest of your life. You will put it up for adoption, if I were the child I would wonder why I got put up for adoption so leave an envolope explaing your sircumstances and everything, so the child will know that their mother cares. As for the dad, well you might want to catch the dad in a good mood not too good and not too bad.  don't tell him too late, and explain to him that you're really sorry that if happened. tell him that you were very foolish and explain the option to him, but tell him that to not use abortion, please not to use that. Also if the guy wants you can have a break from eachother, and decide what you want to do with the child, that what I would do. If I were you I wouldn't be sure what to do, for me either take the child and make sacrifices and raise the child. Or you can put it up for adoption it may be sad but remember the envolope, have it given to the child when they are 8 or 9 it may seem like a young age, but they will understand. please make the right desicion. anyways good luck! and god bless you ;)|`|Is4WEXUJaa	Since you decided to play grown up and not make the guy wear a condom... be a grown up and tell everyone.. you put yourself into this situation now you have to deal with it..|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	Just sitting her down and being completely honest is the best thing. It will show you're being mature about it. Are you keeping it? <br>  <br>  Your family will probably get very mad at first, but think about the next 8 months, they are going to have a grandchild. It's a beautiful thing. Good luck, and all the best. |`|434c6f306298f12f4324bc49555661cbaa	Well, you are gonna have to gut it out girl....talk to your mom first, and then the two of you to your dad...decisions have to be made, and since you are a minor very little of what you may want might may not alter the decision. Hopefully your parents remember when they were younger and understand the situation.....good luck kid!!!!|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	The father of the child should know first. You two should discuss on what you wish to do because you both have rights.  Then either together or just you go to your mom and just tell her.  I know it will be ther hardest thing you have ever done. But the truth is the only thing to say.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|UU3AAlkraa	Ask your mother if she is looking forward to being a grandmother some day then say your wait is nearly over. and for the father say do you want to hear this now or on Mory Povich|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Tell the dad.  Find out what his intentions are, then sit down and tell my mom..like as soon as possible.|`|AqR12hL9aa	First of all, you should definately tell your parents about this. It is extremely necessary that you be able to trust them and they can help you through this. Plus, they are sure to find out once you start showing and it is better to tell them yourself.<br>  <br>  It is probably best to leave the father out unless it is brought up. If it is, try not to use names and explain that what you are doing is really hard and complicated. If your parents get angry then try to calm them down by explaining that it was an accident and an extremely irresponsible thing to do. <br>  <br>  I am hoping you will not get an abortion, but sometimes that is the only answer. If you are not going to do this then choose the right thing and set it up for adoption so that he/she can have a better life.<br>  <br>  I hope everything is going to turn out all right<br>  |`|YzUQMXJ0aa	If your mother loves you the way a mother ought to love her daughter, she'll have a caring and forgiving attitude. You made a mistake, and now you're pregnant. What's done has been done, and now you need to tell the truth. Sit down with your mum and say "mom, I'm pregnant." That's all you can do, and I hope she'll be supportive. <br>  You should tell the father of your child in person if he is a gentle, nice guy, or over the phone if you're afraid he'll become violently angry. You're so young, and I know this will all be very hard, but the truth will set you free. The father has the right to know he made you pregnant. I hope you'll both learn from this, but I hope that you are blessed by this child. Children, however they are conceived, are miracles.<br>  <br>  Please do not even consider an abortion! There are plenty of couples who would love to adopt.|`|b6f151d22968bb6b096edc46ea223f85aa	just sit down with them, be adult about the situation and say I am pregnant, I risked having sex at my age and I became pregnant. Dont say, I dont know how it happened or one thing led to another. Better say it now, than to wait. Talk to your parents first, then gover to the "dad's" hose WITH your parents and explain the situation. Have ideas to how you want to take care of the baby. Possible adoption would be a start,or if you and your parents can handle a new addition, then take on the responsibility. I personally against abortion, adoption is best if you are not at all ready. Next time, well.... abstain from sex until your married! Good luck sweetie|`|szV4lvAeaa	The only thing you can do at this point is to be completely honest with them. Sit them down and tell them you have something very important to share and you need them to be patient and let you finish talking before they say anything. Understand, they are going to be very hurt and upset, and scared for you, but they still love you. |`|SJ9lOnCOaa	if i were you, before i decided to tell your mom you should think about what you want to do then i would tell the baby's father and then your mother. <br>  <br>  <br>  have a plan ready.. <br>  <br>  you may want to try writing a letter , writing helps get your feelings out<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope all goes well :)|`|1N3wmqz7aa	Tell them together (if possible) or tell the one you think would take it the best and have them help you tell the other. <br>  <br>  haha if you are feeling corny decorate your house with it's a boy! decorations (or girl) but it doesn't really matter.  t<br>  <br>  throw a party woo<br>  <br>  watch juno it's funny|`|PRg9UgOlaa	The only way to do it is just come out and say it. There really is no easy way. <br>  <br>  Mom: Mom, I need to talk to you, I am pregnant<br>  Dad: Name, hey remember when we had sex? Yeah, well I am pregnant.<br>  <br>  Go from there!|`|aWU6YCH3aa	Tell your parents "Hey Im Preggers!!"<br>  Tell the dad "Hey Your Gonna Be A Father!!"
ErCJnABBaa	If you are TTC, then DON'T do the baby dance EVERY day.  It runs the risk of his swimmers not having enough time to collect reinforcements and it's like making love with someone with a low count.<br>  <br>  Instead, you should only do the baby dance every second or third day.  If he has a good count and if you are fertile, his guys will hang around for several days waiting until you ovulate.  So it's not neccessary that you do the baby dance the day you ovulate.<br>  <br>  Additionally, keep in mind that each month, you only have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant (and that assumes you've timed the baby dance correctly).  More dancing can not increase those odds.  So you should expect TTC to require MONTHS to be successful.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more, read the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility".|`|4p9sBdyTaa	You probably did not ovulate this month because you were on it for the first 14 days of your cycle. Taking the pill for 14 days can mess up your cycle and make your hormones go a little wonky.

FKQvRZhXaa	If you are having unprotected sex there is always a chance it could be pregnancy, however if you changed your eating habits, activity, lifestyle etc. it could just be your body readjusting. Doesnt sound like anything major. Congrats if its a baby! and you should take an at home test asap to figure out for sure. Good Luck!!|`|TanK6GT3aa	That's most of the classical pregnancy symptoms.

wZAeBisbaa	You can work out any time you feel like it.  Start with something short and easy and see how it goes.  If you've been exercising through the pregnancy, you're not going to be too out of condition, but if you didn't do any exercise, you want to get your muscles and cardiovascular system back into it gradually.  Your bleeding may temporarily increase as a result of moving around, but it should go back to normal quickly.  Don't be surprised if what you were used to before feels very hard now.  It's temporary!  Keep at it, and you'll be surprised how fast you get back into shape.  Exercise will help your mood and stamina too.  |`|14f142d86796d2ef9cdad60ae0ce474daa	two weeks is what they told me.|`|AA11464234	my mom took off 6 months

qygYwdRpaa	oh my gosh you poor thing my heart goes out to you, but miracles can happen so just hang fire until you get your next blood work done, if sadly it does start to end then bleeding and abdominal discomfort is to be expected (not really bad pain) so don't worry about that but I'm sure the biggest pain you will get is in your heart , i had a missed miscarriage last yr at 12 weeks 2 days you never get over it time just makes it easier to cope.<br>  <br>  sending hugs to you <br>  <br>  best of luck x |`|IllWKAUGaa	your best thing to do is to wait until you get more blood work and see how things go. the stress you put on yourself worrying about this could have even greater affects or increase your possibility of miscarraige. you never know, you bub may even turn out to be fine, so the best thing you can do now is to keep a positive mind and hope that everything will work out in due time.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry for your situation and truly hope everything works out for the best!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and TOOOOOONNNSSSSS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!|`|wBpennsMaa	I guess wait on the bloodwork-you never know, things happen, and so do miracles. If they suggest a D & C I wouldn't do it-what happens if it turned out to be a miracle. Get a second opinion. Or just wait for the miscarriage to happen naturally.|`|AA10693194	if i was you I would just wait it out and would not get them to remove the fetus.Miracles can happen so just let your body do the work and maybe your hcg levels will rise and things be get better! dont let anyone tell you what is going to happen! try and think positive! good luck!|`|AA11061445	your Numbers have increased if only by a Little i would wait for blood tests and not let a doctor tell you your going to have a miscarriage unless you are |`|sbfm5rCAaa	This is terrible and my condolences are with you  and your husband.<br>  <br>  Although this has never happened to me I had a close friend who went through it. She was booked into hospital where they did a D&C to remove the fetus and clean out any other bits that migh tbe left over. They also gave her hormone jabs to get her body ready to return to normal so that she could start her period as soon as possible and then try for another baby.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor how they will remove the fetus and how long he recommends before you can start trying again for another baby. My friend was told she could start trying 1 month after her cycle had returned to normal (which was literally 1 month).<br>  <br>  This is probably the best way to ask the doctor to remove it before it miscarries itself as that can be really traumatic for you to see what happens. Although this is terrible and really sad please remember that you will be able to fall pregnant again and will probably carry to term.<br>  <br>  1 in 3 pregnancies end in miscarraige so you are not alone in this.<br>  <br>  I hope my very little imput helps a bit.|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	I too would wait for the numbers from the next blood test.  The doctor doesn't know for sure just yet.  If your numbers have risen again, I would ask them if they are going to do an ultrasound to check on the pregnancy and get more information before they start planning anything like a d & c.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Your levels may or may not rise. Ask them to do a ultrasound to see if there is even a sac. I had low levels at first but they began to rise as time went on and now I am 37 weeks...If the pregnancy terminates it's self you will have some pain and bleeding |`|735KiHn2aa	I am 8 weeks pregnant and am actually just waiting to go into my OB to find out what they want to do, because I think I am in the middle of a miscarriage. Anyways, I have had 1 already and have learned ALOT since then. First off, I would definitely wait and don't be too quick to have anything done. There are documented cases of women whose hcg levels didn't rise very fast at all, and then all of a sudden, took off and they went on to have healthy babies. Second, I would definitely have an ultrasound done. If you are not having any bleeding, spotting, etc... then I would just wait and see. Have them check your hcg and progesterone levels every 48-72 hours, even if you have to pay for it yourself! Last of all, there is a great website that someone here on YA recommended to me- it is www.missedmiscarriage.com and there is a TON of very helpful information regarding miscarriage. I will be praying for you and the health of your precious little one.|`|RcbGiORSaa	I had a miscarriage last october with the same problem.  I had to go in every other day for blood work and all they said was i was goin to miscarry but i had to just wait it out.  it ended up lasting me 3 weeks before i finally scheduled to have a DNC.  they were never able to find a heart rate which you are supposed to find by no later then 6 weeks.  by the time i finally got the DNC i should of been 15weeks.  they didnt see any reason that would have prevented my levels from rising it is just something that happens i guess.  The DNC was very easy and I had no pains afterward, also I am delivering my 3rd child on saturday, and everything has been fine.  there were no complications due to the misscarriage or DNC.  so dont give up it is definately possible for you to have a healthy baby after going through something like this.    |`|SslNP4qdaa	yeah, i would just wait to see what happens, most likely you will begin to have cramps then some spotting, then it will progress....you need to ask the doctor, what will happen and what are the signs that you should go to the ER. Alot of times they say if you bleed through more than one pad an hour...etc, or if you have lightheadedness or dizzyness. Ask him at what point you should go to the ER or if you have to at all. But I wouldn't let them do a D&C. Untill you get a second opinion and INSIST that they do a vaginal ultrasound, to BE SURE.... not the one on your tummy...it wont be able to pick up anything at this point anyway, its too small, the vaginal one will....good luck...|`|bsMJsIBOaa	Hi, first off i am so sorry you are having to go through this after having being trying for 16months, i have suffered 3 m/c this year, have got pregnant straight away after each so although i can get pregnant quick i am having trouble holding onto them.  They shouldn't have checked your bloods 24hrs after having already checked them, they should be monitoring them over 48hrs so for instance if you go back tomorrow and your HCG are around 114 then there is still a chance of a viable pregnancy.  I wish you all the best of luck with this and hope everything works out for you, if this is infact a m/c then just try again, don't give up|`|fb8cf1b6c2124ec3abca58d3c8ea4a2baa	Although your numbers really didn't even rise, and I'm not trying to get your hopes up, I do want to tell you that my sister (who works for a doctor) worked there with a girl who had a very difficult time conceiving.  She finally did and her numbers actually went down from one test to the next.  The doctor told her the pregnancy would end in miscarriage.  she has a baby now.  It is the only time my sister has seen it happen, but know that I guess anything happens.  Wait for your next test before you give up - try to take it easy and do what you can to be good to yourself.  You can ask all kinds of questions at your next appointment, just write down what you want to ask so you don't forget!<br>  <br>  best wishes, I'll pray for you!
VdAT5P6Jaa	Welcome to the terrible twos. My daughter likes to hit things when she doesn't get her way. When she acts out, she gets disciplined. Consistent discipline will work (time-out, loss of privileges,etc.) It may take time, but just be patient. Remember, they're still learning social skills.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	I agree with Ashley.  Instant time-out for hitting, and I make my son tell me why he's in a time-out and make him apologize before releasing him from the time-out, and explain to him why it's not nice to hit.  Then I ask for a hug - he gives me one every time.  Consistency is the key - and lots of love.  Don't give in either - or he wins. <br>  Good luck!|`|ZJZunlU0aa	def normal. my son went through the same thing he is now 3 1/2. I will tell him how wrong it was to throw things and explained to him how is could really hurt someone or hisself. I tried the timeouts that didn't work so I would just put him in his room by hisself until he calmed down and after about 1/2 hour to an hour I would go in and talk to him and have him tell me what he did wrong. Unfortunately it's a stage they go through he will eventually grow out of it. And to the person who mention adhd, that's what I thought about my son and any pediatrician will tell you that he is too young for that as the adhd does not usually start till around the ages of 4-6. But don't worry he will grow out of it.|`|r0mbBgWGaa	I think its part of the terrible 2s. Called that for a reason. Now is the time to discipline him when he behaves badly. This is accomplished by either giving him a time out or a swat on the backside. It depends which one does the trick. I recommend trying the time out first though. He is still a baby but he does need to learn that its unacceptable to throw, hit and bite. If you let him by with it now it will be harder to stop when he's older. The trick is to be consistent with it.|`|08cc9b709b4a8a66ab19893d9acc9758aa	It's just normal 2 year old stuff.  That's why they call it terrible TWO's.

Time out works wonders for mine....and I do find myself putting him there up to 36 times for one sitting...b/c he tries to get up.

NAzAmFDnaa	I know the tag says no sleep, but my baby son liked to sleep in his too, tilted a little to the side.  I got scared one morning though when he was about 6 weeks because he was strong enough to push/roll himself a little more to the side and his face was burried in the hole of the bobby.  Scared the sh** out of me.  We now have a double sided bolster made specifically for sleeping so we can still tip him a little sideways, but there isn't the risk of his face getting burried.  Just be careful!|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	On my son's boppy there is a big giant tag that says do not let baby sleep with. I don't know what it would hurt as long as he isn't on his belly and you are able to keep an eye on him. I wouldn't however use it during the night when you yourself are asleep.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	No!  Not safe!  There's even a big SLEEP with a line through it on a tag on the boppy (meaning don't let a baby sleep with it).  Read the directions!|`|sK8rxstvaa	Mine is asleep in it beside me right now.<br>  BUT as others have said, do NOT leave him unattended. My son slides down in it because he wriggles a bit in his sleep and once he managed to slide to the left and was starting to topple off it. I was there and saw him so nothing happened, but that's the reason they say not to let them sleep on it. They can slide off it, slide down into their blanket, or move and fall face first off it. If they have a bib on, their sliding down will slowly tighten the bib as well.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you are right beside him and keep your eye on him, then these things will be prevented or you'll see him move and then softly right him or slide him up again. I have to slide my son up all the time in it. <br>  <br>  What I did to stop him from rolling off either side is to roll up some smaller blankets and tucking them on either side of his head under the pillow, and having the blankets snuggle to his sides. He can still turn his head and breathe without issue, but won't be able to lift himself up over the bump. I have his feet pointed towards me, so if he slides, his toes bump into me and I know to move him up again.<br>  <br>  If you plan on napping yourself or going to do chores/bathroom/whatever, then I'd suggest putting a blanket on a swing and leaving him on there. It's just safer if you're not in the room and right beside him. When he's starting to do a lot of rolling and moving, then don't let him sleep on it. Once he's older then he can have it as a tv pillow or something - it does fit nicely on the neck and back haha|`|cJCwkPmNaa	It is perfectly safe... i was 17 when my baby brother was born and he loved sleeping in his and now that i'm pregnant i made sure to get one. It's very ideal if you think about it... it'll prop him up, so if he spits up it's less likely to choke him, and he can't roll over to get his face smooshed in something!! You're fine... those pillows are soooo nice to have!! Congrats on the new baby boy!! |`|mN2k6GYgaa	My son is 6 years old now and I remember the best use I got out of our boppy pillow was for him to get his rest! As long as you are monitoring him you guys should be fine. I think that's the purpose for the boppy pillow anyway (SHH!!) don't say anything.|`|YTIgFNQraa	My boppy says on the tag not to leave a baby sleeping in it. If you are sitting right there keeping an eye on him I'm sure it's fine. I wouldn't leave him alone though. |`|kEdXdJMgaa	There is definitely a warning against sleeping in it.  I think it would be ok, if baby is supervised.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	did you not notice the giant tag on the pillow that says DO NOT USE FOR SLEEP. the baby could smother. so no. no no no. |`|jKMH27gKaa	Newborns usually don't sleep more than an hour (maybe two or three) because they need food every few hours, so I would advise against letting him sleep in it (assuming that as a new mom, you are also catching some z's when you can and not able to watch him constantly). You're safer with a co-sleeper or something like that, with nothing he might accidentally smother against. Follow your instincts, they are usually right! Best of luck and congrats on the new baby.
ePpgWES6aa	All these people that say its too early to tell are not entirely correct.  If you go to a ultrasound tech who uses high quality equipment and is very experienced they can tell at 13 weeks.  I was told at my 13 week scan that they were 95% sure it was a girl.  My sister went to the same place and at 13 weeks they told her it was a boy.  At our 18 week scan they confirmed both of the above.  My best friend also found out she was having a girl at 13 weeks.  It just depends on where you go.  Sometimes they can tell but they won't tell you because they aren't 100% sure.  But to answer your question YES, it is very possible to determine the sex at 13 weeks.  Good luck!!|`|EpfVsCa2aa	whats your question? if u are sayin u seen girl parts on the ultra sound that means ur having a girl|`|XHeiEgF1aa	Not possible. You can't tell if its boy or girl until at least 16 weeks.|`|67b9504896a55c7cd66b5d0682a1cf75aa	I completely disagree with below- I found out I was pregnant with a boy at 14 weeks.  I have images of the side profile and you can FOR SURE tell there is a penis there- it's so funny!  However, I do know girl parts are harder to say for sure most of the times, so I would assume it would be more difficult especially that early.|`|yQWnMSc6aa	<a href="http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_genitals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_...</a><br>  <br>  This website is great. Shows you the development of fetal genitalia and an ultrasound of girl/boy parts at 12 weeks (also mentioning gender assignment is about 50% correct at this part of pregnancy).|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Yeah its probably too soon to tell. Especially if you think its girl parts...because the boy parts may not be fully developed yet. I know its exciting...I'm 13 weeks too & I can't wait to find out. Just wait til your 16-18 weeks for the second ultra-sound. Congratulations!|`|G6Mrn6Y3aa	UHH TOO EARLY I THINK PERSONALLY GOOGLE IT|`|snSUf2I7aa	well my cuz had her ultrasound at like 5 months and found out it was a girl so maybe u should se a better doc or something|`|yMngradraa	tooo early.

Most teenagers have a very skewed idea of romance, love and relationships, based on what they have read or seen on television or the movies, and giving up their virginity to someone that they "love" at 14 or 15 automatically puts more importance on a relationship than it usually deserves.<br>  <br>  One of the problems with introducing sex into a relationship is that the development of the relationship usually stops at that point.  After that, it becomes a sexual relationship, as opposed to an emotional one. Everything is centered around sex -- when you're going to do it, where you're going to do it, how to do it without getting pregnant . . . it's a very unhealthy way to grow a relationship.  Teenagers think they are taking a relationship "to the next level" when they have sex -- what they are really doing is bringing the relationship to a grinding halt.  Girls, especially, but guys, too, tend to excuse basic emotional incompatibilities when they start to have sex, and make excuses for a relationship that may have died of its own accord IF sex wasn't part of the mix. <br>  <br>  Sex should be the culmination of a relationship -- not a handshake.|`|6DxMYBoGaa	according to yahoo questions and answers, teenage girls don't care whether they are virgin, most seam to lose there virginity at young age,<br>  in the case of guys, they want to have as many virgin conquest as possible before they get married|`|E94q1IrUaa	it depends on the person<br>  most guys like a chick that isnt to beat up |`|71wBNgbnaa	It is very important to me. I always resolved to myself that while I may not wait for marriage, I would wait until I felt that I was completely ready and with someone who wouldn't just use me to get sex. <br>  <br>  I am eighteen years old and I am still a virgin. Many people I know think that's weird, but I don't see it as weird at all. It just means that my virginity means a lot to me, and the person that I give it up to has to understand that, and I also have to know that it means a lot to them too - that I love and trust them enough to go all the way with them. <br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, virginity is still important to many young people. To be cliche, a lot of people will say "Well everybody's doing it," and many of us, myself included, can say, "Not me." :)|`|enYNP1V8aa	Society as a whole where I live anyway....no I dont think it is its more like a game!<br>  Me growing up it was very important to me, I wanted to lose it at the legal age, with someone I loved.

I talk to him alot about peer pressure, and "losing it" when the time is right not when your friends are doing it.<br>  Many teenagers think its geat to sleep around, I had a friend who lost it to a guy on holiday....she was 14, I know she regrets it now.|`|7lPspOboaa	It is to my daughter.  She has asked for a purity ring which is a reminder to stay pure till marriage.  With all the diseases and such about it is safer to be a virgin.  Also it is a wonderful thing to share yourself for the first time with the one that will be your husband for life.  (that should be your attitude with marriage.)  |`|C2IHEOcZaa	As a teenager, it is fairly important.

But for a lot, it doesn't matter anyway as long as you do it with the one you love.|`|ul1wQ4xgaa	it was to me|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	to any with self respect or morals |`|FIz66tFIaa	,for me its important because virginity is a gift that you give to your husband/wife on your wedding night.god created sex just for marriage and for the married ones.and there is no right age to lose your virginity until you're married with someone whom you really love.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|zgctxYh2aa	Virginity was VERY important to me. I gave it to my best friend this time last year and we are still best friends and I am so glad I gave it to him. I trusted him and he trusted me. But sometimes it isn't that girls don't have respect it is that she is forced or pressured into it. . |`|YPf5DGjdaa	It was very important to me and I wanted to make sure that I found the right person to lose it to. I waited until I was 19 to lose my virginity and I'm glad that I did. I would not be able to handle the possible consequences were I any younger. |`|H79TKKiBaa	I think there's very few people where it's not important at all. However what is not always important anymore (rarley is really) is the age-old belief that sex should wait until after marrige, a practice rarly carried out by teenagers.|`|mWVTE5rgaa	So you wouldn't have to worry about pregnacy and STDs yes, abstinence is the key. |`|VQxJyn2Kaa	yes of course. .Virginity is still important|`|UOQ0X3tSaa	it is very important to me....don't know about rest of them! and i'm still a virgin|`|14758beebbc24fdd7d0d13f1be12be68aa	boooo!!!! go OPPOSITION!! haha,, joke! of course, it's important..<br>  but I want you to loose! BOOO!!! BOOOOOOO!!<br>  <br>  |`|y4SUDnpaaa	To most young people having sex has no meaning  ...sometimes it's treated almost like a handshake and something you just have to endure as a part of growing up and the earlier you get it done the better. They should consider virginity as  the greatest gift they have to offer and not something to take lightly. I'm realistic  enough to know that few teens remain  virgins until they marry. My concern is the lackadaisical attitude amount teens about having  sex and missing out on what should be a wonderful memory if you wait for the right person.Maybe  it won't be the person you marry but  make it someone who is worthy of your greatest gift and who understands the difference between making love and having sex|`|7SgVzX4daa	Of course! I'm 13 and PROUD to be a virgin! Waiting for marriage baby! <br>  <br>  Imagine this:<br>  Girl is say bout 14 or 15 and is a virgin. She meets a guy and "falls in  love with him." He claims to also to be a virgin, so she decides to have sex with him. 2 months later, he cheats on her and wasn't really a virgin. <br>  <br>  That's a perfect example of why I'm waiting for my Mr. Right. Of course, I have been asked, but sorry buster. Waiting for marriage here!<br>  
2U4CZk3kaa	you could be=] wait a few weeks and take a test|`|FsaOBuiKaa	no you aren't being silly!<br>  <br>  you can get pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  You should really just wait until you missed your period and take a test.  There isn't anything you can do about it now! But, if your breasts start to hurt, then I'd start to worry.  All of the other symptoms could be stress related... relax.|`|g12mpbK2aa	Of course you could be pregnant if you are having unprotected sex.  Why do you say the 2-6th are fertile days?   Unless you are tesing, taking your temp, charting etc they could be totally not in normal range.  Take a pregnancy test on the 22nd if you have not had your period. Thirsty is a sign of diabetes, as well as feeling sluggish.  I don't think being congested has anything to do with being pregnant. The flu is also going around as well.  I just had it, was sluggish and stuffy in the mornings for a week before my body finally gave in.|`|67b9504896a55c7cd66b5d0682a1cf75aa	I would go and buy the generic pregnancy test at walmart- they have some with several tests in the pack and test tomorrow morning and see.  They are activated with 25 HCG which is less than a lot of the "name" brand pregnancy tests and can gtell you sooner!  Good luck!|`|GBSO1Efraa	consult your doctor because I've had the same thing happen to me but I wasn't pregnant.  So your best bet is to do a pregnancy test or go to the doctor. Going to the doctor will confirm what is going on with your body.|`|CtwGOAykaa	good possibility! but could also be something else! go to a doctor?|`|bF50zA8Eaa	You could be and you probably are. otherwise it is all in your head because you want to be pregnant, But just wait about 2 weeks and take the test, if it comes out negative, then wait one more week to do it again just to be sure.|`|eXAQ3kZRaa	you could be, and i know it is difficult to wait, but its all you can really do. <br>  wait until the day you expect your period and take a hpt...<br>  good luck!!|`|BEvaEQOpaa	You must want to be pregnant b/c you aren't using any contraceptive. You probably are pregnant. Waking up in the middle of the night to change diapers is going to be fun!|`|OeItQKqhaa	you generally don't ovulate until the middle of you cycle which is half way between the end of your period and the start of your next period so i would say you are fine but sperm can live for a long time in your body so really there is only about a week or so where its not likely to get pregnant... also that is not an exact science, pregnancy can happen anytime! Also why unprotected sex? birth control is readily avail. as for all the stuff you are feeling I'm pretty sure you are just scaring yourself! therefor again if you are scared I ask why unprotected sex?
AA11643179	If you are seeing white on your baby's tongue, and it doesnt go away, its probly thrush, not formula.  if you can wipe it off, then its probly formula |`|pXSKSS3daa	What about it?<br>  <br>  If it's formula it will come off with a washcloth. If it doesn't come off then it's thrush and that requires a visit to your baby's pediatrician.|`|1dueLOdvaa	What about it?|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	If it wipes off you are good to go... If it doesn't it could be thrush. <br>  <br>  But I do hear that sometimes a baby falls asleep and doesn't swallow all of the milk. <br>  |`|gC1ITdJUaa	You should take your baby to the doctor and have them check for thrush. I thought it was formula too. Its an easy fix. Just some drops for about a week should clear it up!|`|Ouhzs81kaa	I "brush" my daughter gums & tongue from 3 months on with Baby gum cleaner and the special finger brush they provide with it.|`|GqrhpZgLaa	its very normal for the formula to stick to the babies tongue, they don't have enough saliva to rinse their mouth like us, you can give them an ounce of water after giving them formula.<br>  they sell the baby tongue and gum cleaners in stores such as walmart or you can use a damp baby wash cloth and gently wipe their tongue, its very important for you to clean their tongues and their gums because babies are prone to thrush.  |`|65856a5f3620034d9e285d8528114adbaa	Hmmm... Sometimes after jonah eats I notice formula in his mouth, I usually just wipe it out with a clean towel.  |`|eI02IpWdaa	i was told by my ped to give her 1oz of water in a baby bottle and it goes away...so far so good
eRlNQxbNaa	You're probably just bloated... Your uterine and abdominal muscles are still very tight with your first pregnancy so it' ll take a while for them to stretch.  Remember, you start to "show" very low; above your pubic bone.  At first it's not that nice round belly you start to get at 4-5 months or so.  Unless maybe you are expecting multiples.  In that case you'll have to request a scan! :)|`|01vMpHkWaa	maybe its more then one baby?      its normal though for even one baby|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Normal.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	Normal, some people start showing at 6 weeks.    Or maybe you're pregnant with twins? or triplets?
9LWuWHiMaa	hello, get up go to the store and read some packaging label  at least i think that is wat you are asking
Irm5gynTaa	well, i am a babysitter (nanny actually)  and i wouldn't leave my children with most sitters  you want someone who has your child's best interest at heart, who is going to do learning activities with your child, and who your child can have fun with. you don't want someone who is just going to put your child in front of a tv (A L O T ) of babysitters do, because the child ends up getting bored and missing mommy, and then you feel bad for leaving them with a sitter and switch sitters, and you just keep switching and your child wont feel secure.  I'd say go for a high school sitter, even look on craigslist.org for a home schooled high school student.  I watch a four year old, and her mom likes me because I am homeschooled, so I can be there all times and I am young so I can run around and give her child one on one time, also we do TONS of arts and crafts, and field trips so she is constantly learning new and exciting things.   Don't worry, your maternal instincts will kick in, you'll have a feeling when you find the one. you wouldn't leave your daughter with just anyone :)|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Would u let a boy babysit? just wondering. it seems like all babysitters are girls.|`|FGIaKsPsaa	you should try to find one that a friend or relative has used, or that someone you can trust has vouched for. If the babysitter was good for a family you know, she/he will probably be good for your kids.|`|Vo4IXBdtaa	I am a gut feeling type of person so when I met with my prospective baby-sitters in person I was immediatly drawn to one of them. I knew I had found the right one when my daughter also seemed to like her. So far it has worked out. good luck...i know this can be difficult|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I agree with onnaoko I use the baby sitter that my older sister uses for her twin boys. they are older than my daughter who is 3 they are 10 but she is great with all of them. my sister recommended her about a year ago. and my daughter really liked her. she is always asking for her to come over especially when her other friends aren't around for her to play with. she's 18 and she's really mature she has younger siblings as well and she is the oldest so she has experience with the young ones. even though my sister liked her and recommended her I was still nervous because she had never met my daughter before but every thing was all right. if we can't get her to babysitt then my parents watch her.|`|Roui5iT5aa	write down a list of all the things you want in a sitter and just keep interveiwing until you get the right one :)|`|tOaZcxQXaa	well make sure you ask them all the questions you have  and if you feel nervous about leaving your kid with them you should install a nanny cam so you can see exactly what their doing-  thats if their babysitting at your house.

SEzIkGNiaa	My sister got her first pet (a fish) at the age of 10.  BUT, she had to keep her room clean for a whole month in order to prove that she was responsible enough to take care of a pet.  She has had 5 fish to date, and takes great care of them, and is even planning to breed and sell!|`|j2mRop0laa	We got our kids matching boy/ girl kittens when they were 8 and 4.   My husband and I take care of them. They just give them snacks and water and cuddle and play with them.    I got my own rescue kitty several months back. She is so adorable and such a baby and kind of rotten. Sorry, I had to throw her in, even though she is only mine. I get agitated if anyone touches her, but me.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	We've had cats and a dog since before the kids were born - they do help now but the care is still primarily done by my husband and I.    Our daughter got a turtle when she was 3 - I didn't want her to have it but Grandpa bought it anyway.  She fed it but only with our supervision.  She would play with him (it's not like he was fast enough to get away!) but we did most of the care so we didn't have to deal with turtle death.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	they were born with pets ..horses goats  wolf/dog pigs chickens cats|`|Mzjoeld4aa	my parents got 2 cats before i was born and i had them untill i was 11 and i got more pets so pretty much ive been talking care/loving animals all my life. ive had 3 cats, 1 dog and they breed were 2 tabby cats, 1 maincoon cat and 1 cockapoo (mostly all i really do as work for them is take the dog out for a walk and give food/water to all of them plus love)|`|a4qyasMHaa	My first pet was when i was one and it was a dog but of course i couldn't take care of it. But i have had a lot of pets in the past that range from bird, dogs, cats, fish, lizard, frogs. And yes i took care of them very well. As age range goes it depends on how well they can take care of it most of the time responsibility comes in around the age of 7 and up.|`|GuK9yLGJaa	my daughter got a gold fish at the age of 2 1/2 easy fun pet and she liked to watch it but a pet like that it doesnt matter if they take care of it drop some flakes in the tank once a day and your good.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	she came home to one a black lab and they love eachother so much  Taz would lay on the floor with her when shed sleep at 2 months or younger Now taz has to be teased by her at 20 months lol my daughter feeds the dog and gives her treats|`|uGFzzLYWaa	We've always had pets in the house, since my daughter was old enough to walk.  I love them as much as my daughter does. We've had hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs.   It was always the both of us doing it, because we were both into it.    She was 12 when she wanted her "own" parakeet. She's 15 now, and it's still alive. She takes pretty good care of it.    Don't get a pet that YOU are not prepared to take care of. Sometimes kids have good intentions and they mean to take care of the animal, but they don't because they're kids.|`|JvZY0ZS4aa	Great question! My husband and I are not 'pet people'. Our view is that we'd much rather put the time, effort and money into our kids and family as a whole, than have to deal with all the down sides of owning a pet (fur, fleas, vet bills, poop, etc).    With that being said, we won't deny our kids a pet if they truly desire one - provided they can take care of it themselves. My daughter has talked about wanting a dog since she was 3 (she's now 5). We've made it clear to her that when she's old enough to take care of it we will get her one and have told her what's involved in doing that. I'm not sure when she will be ready to take on the responsibility, but not likely for a few more years still.     I know many parents will think we're depriving our children by delaying getting a pet, but I think it's more humane for the pet in the end. If we got one now, we would not have the time or often desire to take care of it. Growing up we had way too many pets we got because they were cute puppies or kittens which ended up being neglected as we weren't taught the responsibility of owning a pet.     When we do get a pet, I want to do it the right way. It will be a big event in our family and we'll all be happy about it and ready to take on the responsibility. Until then, we wait...
sBHhnDwaaa	Um.... When did I go?... Ok, yeah, they check dilation and eff-whatever. Good luck! Maybe you'll be 2cm too!!    They wait until your next appointment to tell you, I guess. She told me today (not my scheduled appointment). Keep your fingers crossed for us for Thursday!!|`|G4qP2gATaa	Your doctor will more than likely check your cervix. Mine did!|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Depends on the doctor.  With my first I started getting checked at 32 weeks because I started dilating then.  With my second I requested my midwife checked me, otherwise she wouldn't have.  I wasn't checked again until I went in for a NST at 38 weeks.|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	I just had to get undressed from my waist down and the doctor has this kinda of rubbery toothbrush looking thing and they scrape one side by your vagina the other by your anus.  I tested positive for Group B strep which I guess is pretty common after doing some research.  It wasn't a big deal at all.  I just had some antibiotics in my IV in the hospital and all was fine.|`|VT24zOomaa	i had mine last week at 35 weeks, and they checked my cervix, but my midwife wont check me again until 38 weeks, they prefer to leave the cervix alone, every time it's touch, it can speed up labor.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	m glad you asked! I sure hope they check and don't know why they couldn't since they are already down there!! I have mind on Monday.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	Just had it and they checked my cervix as well.|`|xy5UNiELaa	It depends on the doctor.  Most begin weekly exams at 37-40 weeks.  Some sooner, some later.  It may also depend on your particular pregnancy.  When I had my test done, it was just a swab.  The exams started the next week.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	They should test your cervix as well.  They normally test it weekly beginning at 36 weeks.
OtbbKdITaa	Just wait - lol. My daughter is a year old & she's had morning breath for about 2 or 3 weeks now. It just kind of sneaks up on ya!|`|FjekAwGmaa	I think they have bad breath sometimes. They don't have any teeth though. This is where our halitosis comes from. Food and bacteria gets stuck between our teeth in places we can't reach and starts to rot. Rotting food reeks. Without teeth, there can be no rotting food. Don't forget to floss!|`|dcNmRPGPaa	they dont have any or enough teeth|`|2qDvgzfdaa	No teeth, no ROTTING cavities.|`|TiSF39nbaa	beacuse they dont have teeth|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Most babies don't seem to have bad breath because the major cause of bad breath is the tongue, not the stomach or the teeth.  Bacteria on the top of the tongue produce sulfur containing compounds that smell bad to other people.  Most people can not smell their own bad breath. Bad breath is not a disease but a condition which can be controlled by just properly cleaning the tongue.  It is not a mystery either.  Good oral hygiene includes cleaning and flossing the teeth and then cleaning the tongue.  Learn more about the cause and cure of bad breath at http://www.orabrush.com|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	I think most bad breath comes from our digestive system, from our stomachs and all the layers of crap that adhere to our intestines.  Plus babies eat and drink more frequently so they're constantly washing out the old stuff and replacing it with new.  Plus, if you're like most parents you take care of them more than you do yourself. You're probably very good about cleaning and brushing her teeth :)

TBNaPkl6aa	Oh sweetie, I wish I could give you a hug.  I had overall a very pleasant experience with my daughter, and I am much happier than I thought I'd be, but let me tell you, it wasn't easy at first.  I managed to breastfeed because I had good support and harassed every local lactation consultant, but b/fing was tough at first.  So I was depressed about that.  Then there were the constant visitors while I was still so insecure about my mothering skills.  Oh, and I can't forget the first month of getting my daughter to understand the difference between night and day...that was interesting.  I got so little sleep that I barely remember what it was like to not get sleep (does that make sense?).  I remember feeding her constantly, wondering if I should supplement because, according to my thoughts, "What kid eats every half hour?"  (turns out that's normal).    It's hard when it's your first baby and you've had virtually no previous experience with children, let along babies. At least, that's how it was for me.  But luckily, I had an easygoing good sleeper with no colic, so my experience has been quite positive, and I developed deep feelings for my girl right away.  Still, the first couple months of getting to know her made understanding her cues very difficult.  If she had been colicky or anything like that, I would have lost my freaking mind.    There is nothing unnatural about the way you felt or what you went through.  It's called being human.  Every baby is different.  Don't let any "perfect" mom tell you otherwise.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	Ill Share!  Of course my pregnancy did not go well my son was coming out ear first and I had to have an ER Csection. WHICH the C section was soooo much better then my 41 hrs or hard painful labor. I got home and the first week was fine cause my hubby was home with me. I slept on the couch at first then on the weekends I slept in the bed.. THEN THE BLUES HIT. He went to work the baby would CRY and i was alone I have issues falling asleep SO the 3 hours or less I had to go to sleep was never enough. I was out on the couch during the week so my hubby could have sound sleep for work I felt thrown out and not wanted. He could not help on the weekend cause I was BF.. THEN my son got worse at 5 weeks he was feeding every hour and crying alot and had alot of gas. I called the doc cause he was still in NB cloths after being born at 8.6. He was 7.10 we supplimented with formula and he rejected me after I was crushed wanting to feed my son formula cause I say the improvement but then feeling like crap cause i could not BF HE was still fussy I was home alone cause my hubby worked 40 hrs and did 5 hours of school adn then had homework. I could not believe it. We were fighting and I was at my breaking point. I almost punched my hubby in the face for coming home early from work because of a REALLY BAD fight. I talked to my doc and was giving zoloft and my hubby now takes weekend feedings now that my son is taking formula. It was hardest being alone with a new child.    Those perfect moms are the ones who lie and to scared to admit whats wrong. My mom will clam she is a perfect mom but she still is suffering from depression and after getting help I see that she has never gotten over the first set of baby blues and she has 6 kids.. Behind close doors she is quick tempered and will call her 6 yr old a son of a btch. THANK god I caught the problem early.|`|PAdif484aa	"Perfect moms" don't exist - at least not in my world. I think all of us have had moments where we wonder "what the heck was I thinking?" I have a 3 month old who will not sit or lay down by himself. I have to carry him everywhere. I can't even go to the bathroom by myself most of the time. It's stressful and I have days where I just want to walk out of the house, close the door, and not come back (of course I never would do that). I have come to accept it and look since you can't spoil a newborn, I don't worry about it. I know some people would not agree with me, but this little boy is my baby and I do what works for us. Like one other person mentioned about, just remember "this too shall pass".|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i am sure there are plenty of mothers, esp ones with difficult babies that have similar stories....the important thing is you love baby , and you bonded with baby, and baby knows you love her.....the baby blues can make a huge difference in how u feel toward your baby and there isn't anything 'wrong' with having the feelings while having the blues; it just makes you feel guilty; obviously u loved him bc u continued to care for baby....|`|HF97Rs9qaa	Well I myself have no postpartum story, my first baby is due very soon and I am not worried about it but it runs in the family.    My sister had it with all 3 of her kids, to the point where they were taken from her. She thought of hurting them or killing them. She gets very severe post partum which is usually very rare.    Then my aunt with both of her kids had it for about 3 weeks in the beginning. She did not want to feed them, hold them or care for them at all. It took her time to bond with them but now she is a wonderful mother. My sister is not a wonderful mother and I worry about her kids every day.    Then recently my friend was actually put in a mental institution for her post partum. She said she was having thoughts about hurting him or killing him so she realized that was not normal and she herself surrendered him. She got help and got over it.    I think it is wonderful you were able to work through yours and it did not detour you from having another.    I personally do not fully understand postpartum because I myself could never imagine not wanting to be with my baby or getting mad at my baby for doing what babies do, cry, scream, poop and demand all of your time lol. I also can not understand wanting to hurt your baby.    But I know it is a medical condition and is not something women want to get or have full control over.    I give you a lot of praise for having the strength and love to get through it because I have seen and heard some scary things about it.|`|2dxlnfJYaa	I was majorly down with both of mine for at least the first 6 months and then they got a little older and things just felt right again. As far as my babies went, neither one of them slept until they were 7 mths old they wanted to breastfeed around the clock, I was chronically tired and they didn't want anyone but me so that meant NO BREAK. The thing you have to tell yourself is "this too shall pass".     P.S. Those "perfect" moms are lying through their teeth. Some women look at themselves as failures if they admit that their baby doesn't sleep through the night or that they're not on some perfect schedule.    You're doing great!!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	I had a pretty easy baby and I still felt like that at times!  I had a hard time nursing and he wasn't a good eater at first, and I felt like I wasn't cut out for motherhood because I couldn't even feed my own child!  Now he is a great nurser!  No one can prepare you for how hard (AND FABULOUS!) motherhood is, and I find it hard to believe that there are moms out there who have never experienced that frustration!|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	And that's what makes YOU a perfect mother.  The fact that despite how miserable and tired you were you kept trying to keep your baby happy. Despite how sleep deprived, how agonizing, how many nights you cried and how frustrated you were, you didn't let your baby suffer or cause it any pain (e.g. those women who shake, hurt or punish their babies).  I didn't have any PPD with my son but with my daughter, my body had changed so much, I had a c-section and was sooo tired, there were a few days when I just wanted to get in the shower so I could cry.  Luckily, that wore off pretty quickly and I did have a peaceful baby after the first two weeks.  You're not alone. You're not the only one who has sat on the floor, in the corner of a room crying louder than your baby and you certainly won't be the last.  What counts is that you try your best and love that baby with all your heart, like you do.    Congratulations and thx for your post!

R1zUIh7taa	My littlest girl just had one on Sunday!  She cried the whole time for about an hour after too!  It has yet to help her be regular, we are going on a week now and she has gone to the 3 times at the end of the week!
1SGl03Zlaa	When they start to sit up or crawl, because it won't be long after that they will learn to stand up.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I always moved mine to the bottom when the kids could start getting up on hands and knees. It never is too long after that when they start pulling themselves up.|`|mTQutqyAaa	when ur baby can either sit up on it's own or crawl, either of those, whichever comes first. the reason for that is cuz once they start doin those things they can learn to pull up at any moment and can then easily tumble opver the side.|`|OEv8gjPxaa	I moved my sons mattress to the bottom when i woke up one morning and found my son standing up in his crib trying to get out. So as soon as your baby starts standing or can pull them self up that's when you put it down|`|DLDweOcYaa	I moved the mattress when my daughter started pulling herself up on to her legs and that was when she was 9 and a half months old.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I always moved mine once my children learned to sit up. That way you can assure yourself they will not fall out!
ebQJsYTxaa	Your body will be going through enough after birth.  You don't need to stress it out even more with the vaccine.  You will also be going through enough with a new baby, and you don't need to add dealing with the possible risks of the vaccine.    Whooping cough is not very common in the winter, anyway.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I had a midwife and was never offered the vaccine. My daughter's pediatrician never suggested we get it either, yet they did push me to get myself a flu shot.|`|MtC3CWZraa	My doc hasn't asked me about it, but I plan to ask him. Apparently this disease is making a comeback in young children because their parent's immunity has worn off and babies have none until they're vaccinated.     I only know about it because one of the pediatricians we interviewed brought it up.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Never heard of it!|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Nope never heard of that.  The nurses offered me a flu shot which I did take.|`|ayiCDGhNaa	yes, i had my son about a month ago. they asked about the whooping cough vaccine and flu shot. i got both. only side affect i had was a little soreness. you should get both just because you're going to be the primary care giver for your baby and baby's can die if they were to catch the whooping cough and they definitely can't get the flu. isuggest you do it, especially at this time of year. good luck with your decision
ZbnxGIsnaa	I definitely had all those symptoms while I was pregnant with my son.  I truly hope you are pregnant.  Please let us know if you are!!!  =)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I did but try to not get too overly excited until you see a positive. :) I know how hard it can be. I tried for a full year. I'm crossing my fingers for you.
lFBR5Cepaa	Oh my Gosh, I know your looking for help but G-OD she is crazy lol, why don't you just ignore her and avoid going anywhere with her until she stop breast feeding to save you the embarrassment avoid eating any cereal she makes for you or anything dealing with milk lol I am sorry I just have to laugh.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	lol...your post made me laugh.<br>  <br>  I feel sorry that your step mom is nuts.But,you have to look at her reasoning (although she is still nuts) breast is best and some people are just unaware of this fact so she is trying to make others away (although she is more like an extremist protester lol)<br>  <br>  And I somewhat agree, the thought of breast milk is a bit icky (Any liquids that come out of the human body disgust me) but what do you think you are drinking when you drink cow's milk?<br>  <br>  If anything, drinking boob juice is more sanitized than cows milk.Cows lay in their own urine and feces.Although farmers to sanitize the **** and the milk is pasteurized for consumer protection, there is no going around the fact that it is a nasty thing.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should try to convince your step mom to take more easier proactive steps for the cause she is trying to promote.Nobody listens to the crazy religious people on the street corners.|`|MW18liqTaa	A lot of people come on Yahoo Answers looking for help with breastfeeding. Tell her to come on here and help people!|`|Mh8pATk8aa	introduce her to some of the breastfeeding fanatics here. she'll fit right in. <br>  <br>  sorry that she is nuts. eventually her milk with dry up and you can forget this phase ever happened.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	Wow. She's going way too far. Sounds like she may need counseling!|`|YLXpwqceaa	All I can say is holy crap!!!!|`|hpXqbEnBaa	weirdo!! lol... hey shes very happy about being able to breast feed, ... i dont like the whole flyer thing... cuz thats not right, but she wants to put milk in oatmeal .. o well, he is getting nutruents, lol ...  but seriously she needs some counceling.|`|Nn5pKe8baa	We'll I think she needs a therapist she is a really um.. judgmental it sounds like and your right she does need to calm down you need to do something about this immediately she is out of control|`|i8C7pvJCaa	It is okay. Let her be crazy about it for a little while.<br>  Tell her to go on yahoo answers. There are plenty of people looking for breastfeeding help on here.|`|gpPZeoNRaa	woooowww <br>  she needs to calm down<br>  mabey you should tell her about what shes doing, if she hears is she might see how crazy it is|`|5f2u8TQKaa	woa! defanitley sounds like she needs some counceling
QGkBZFqWaa	Well first of all, you are not mature enough to have sex.  Secondly, Take a pregnancy test if you are worried. They sell them at CVS. Pee in a cup and dip the tester into it and wait for your reading.|`|DQHC3EZuaa	yh your probs pregnant  =D|`|XxGB4eGyaa	i think since you had your period you're probably ok  but sometimes it does feel weird when you first have sex  it can feel kinda weird or maybe just a little bit of pain  but look for other signs of pregnancy  serious fatigue and sleepiness   breast pain  there are plenty of sites that show of symptoms of  pregnancy    if you're really scared do the best you can to buy  a home pregnancy test|`|hswTS1jVaa	You can still go to the doctor, it doesn't matter how old you are.  Go to the store and get a pregnancy test.      Yes, you could be pregnant if you had sex.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	Well that was a long time ago! You dont have to go to the doctor just take a test. If you had sex that long ago and you are pregnant than you would probably have a little bit of a large stomach already.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Sorry mate at 14 you're NOT a woman...you're a little girl!     It's not impossible, but it is unlikely if you've had a period. You can go to the Drs, and they can't tell your parents because of patient confidentiality.    A weird being above your vagina? Is the pun intended? x|`|uzQgWLZnaa	Did you use a condom?    even if you did use one, theres a slight chance of you being pregnant.  It only takes one sperm to make you pregnant, and he will produce millions|`|zB2PIUmzaa	yes!!!!!!|`|MHj1lFgOaa	Go to one on those State Clinics that give free services to people or buy a pregnancy test in any pharmacy, but if you didn't use a condom you'll need to see a doctor anyway for the risk of being infected with some STD.|`|XLhLC36baa	wth? YES duhh of course you could be pregnant!   You figured out a way to have sex, figure out a way to get a test|`|49LiABmvaa	yes you can be pregnant - there's always a chance  take a HPT  if that comes out positive you have to go to the doctor  if you get someone else to take you there you don't need to take your mom with you. they're not allowed to tell your mom.  im 14 and pregnant so e-mail me for anything|`|cmEi3CVqaa	you can go to the doctor and without your parents or carer finding out. the doctor wont tell them anything at all. they can give u a free pregnancy test and they can also help you make a decision about what to do next if u find that u are pegnant. also if u r not and u have soemthing else wrong then where else is better than being at a doctors where they can diagnose the problem and get it sorted.    good luck.|`|KUZsgJqwaa	you might.  or you have a sexual transmited desies...      but you should go to the dr.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Are you in UK ?   Then you can go to Dr at 14 without yr parents.      Here is a REALLY good support grp (link below) as well for 13-19yrs for ANYTHING - even careers advice, pregnancy, training - anything they are fabulous.    Hope everything is ok.  You need to get checked out as you may not be pregnent but have STD that needs quick treatment.  When I went to see pracise nurse with 15 yr old daughter for her boosters nurse told me it was odd to see mums these days and I said well she is still a minor surely until 18 and she said oh no not any more for medical purposes she is considered adult in her own right now so does not need chaparone from age of 14.    Connexions is all confidential anyway and they DO NOT judge you .
SEzIkGNiaa	Bring your keys!  I once got locked out of my house at 1:00 in the morning and I didn't have any keys.  Trust me, that isn't fun:    *Keys  *Books (or something to do while they are in bed)  *Confidence  *Dollar Store Crafts to do with the kids|`|InZU5aaxaa	Take your cell phone, but make sure it is on silent or vibrate. Take a book, or study materials with you if you know you are going to stay late after children are in bed. Take a snack with you, not all parents provide food. Make sure you are dressed comfortable yet presentable. Take your purse or backpack with normal over night needs. Extra shirt you may have a food accident with younger children.    Good luck.|`|XwPyne6Raa	Use to take materials so the kids could do an art project or a special game with me.  The kids always looked forward to me bring something special to do and that parents like that fact that I thought about their kids ahead of time and that I planned on doing more that watching TV all night.  If they are real young it can be something simple like printing out color pages off the internet and bringing them.  Just remember with kids it can be simple and still very exciting to them.
796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	Craigslist is a great place to try. All states and areas have a Craigslist site with a "childcare" section. There are always people posting in there looking for babysitters/nannies and people looking for jobs. I've found a few myself and a few friends have as well. You could also post an ad in the "ETC" section located in the jobs category.     You can post for free and you should get plenty of responses. You may get a few not so great answers, but just ignore them. There are plenty of real parents looking for great childcare. Make the ad detailed but to the point. Mention any experience you have caring for children, the fee you plan to charge and your plans for entertainment and educational activities you would have for the children. Parents are looking for all of that when searching the ads.     Good luck! I hope you find a child to care for soon!

PKvKPv8uaa	Maybe do both.   You can pump occasionally, but do mostly formula.  You have already done so much for your son, any breast feeding is worth it.  Even the amount of time you have already done he will already experience some health benefits.    I know, my son was born at 31 weeks, so I spent so much time pumping for him!  Ughh, so much work to pump every two hours.  By the time you get it pumped, stored/fed, cleaned for the next pumping it is time to start all over again!  So much work.  I always wanted a hands free system, I was already doing the double pumping (which I really hope you are) but would have loved even the slightest bit more freedom.  Also, you have to consider how you will keep up pumping while at work, where are you going to pump, store, clean your equipment?  These are difficult things to consider.  I hated the looks that I got while cleaning my equipment and it was really a pain.    In the end I quit my job to be a stay at  home mom.  My son refused the bottle and ended up flipping his night and days so he could bf all night long.  I am happy with the decision I made, but the point is it is a decision I made for my family.  This is something you have to do for yours!    Stop being so hard on yourself.  Formula provides what you and your baby need.  Good luck!  You are doing a great job, and only you can decide what is right for your family.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Well regardless of what you end up doing you have him a good start in life.  These first few weeks it was very important for him to get your breast milk and you provided that to him, even though it is so very time consuming to pump.    I exclusively pumped for my daughter for 12 months.  I was fortunate to have a good supply most of the time.  I ended up pumping because my milk didn't start to come in until 8 days after my c-section.  My daughter had to have formula for a few days and she would not try my breast again.    So anyway- I pumped all the time as well. It was really tough and I can understand how you feel.      Maybe I can help you pump if you want to try to continue-  1.  if you haven't tried breast massage before you pump and while you pump, then try it.  It was the single best thing that I did to keep my supply up.    2. also I realized that unless my supply was really good that day that pumping for more than about 20 minutes at a time was not worth it.  I generally go the most in the first 20 minutes.  If I didn't get enough in that time period, I just stopped and went back after an hour or so.    3. I drank Mother's Milk tea.  It seemed to help and it wasn't very expensive.  I don't know if it would work for you, but it might be worth trying.  And it didn't taste bad either.  You can find it at most Health food stores, or stores that have a large Organic or Health food section.    Just remember, that you gave him a wonderful start and it is O.K to give formula.  Actually if the formula allows you to spend some more quality time with your child then maybe the formula is best anyway.   I tried to use formula with my daughter when she was 6 months old.  But she wouldn't drink it at all.  So I was stuck pumping longer than I really wanted to.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	My first was a preemie too, and never quite got the hang of latching, at least as well as my second, non-preemie.  So I pumped alot early on, so know what you are going thru.    Formula is expensive though, if you are concerned about money, thats huge.  I can see the pumping going down to every 3 hours.  The other thing I did, was add a supplemental pumping a couple hours after they went to bed, so I wouldnt have to so often at work.      My other tip is to get a second set of attachments (cheaper than even one can of  formula)  This was heaven in the middle of the night, as I wouldnt have to wash them in the middle of the night, and could do them both together in the morning.    Good luck, I remember it being really tough too, but if you can, just focus on getting him thru cold and flu season.  Theres so much going around now, and especially with a preemie, you want to do what you can.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	See if there's any temporary assistance you can get so you can take a little more time off of work.  You might be eligable for WIC or foodstamps which will help alot.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	instead of a breastfeed "counselor" have you tried a board certified lactation consultant?     this site might be able to help you as well    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/adopt/index.h...|`|r5R2nstRaa	i had to give up the breast to go back to work also. its not all bad giving your baby formula. at least you did breast feed. and you did your best. just think, some mothers don't even think of breast feeding. some times you just want to be done with the darn thing. and it seems like you are. its ok, go ahead and work!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	how about trying to pump just some of the supply so he gets the nutrients from breastmilk but you don't feel like a cow?|`|IngripgMaa	I felt the same.  But what is best for your son, is to have his Mom be healthy....Mentally Healthy.  It's very important too.|`|PAdif484aa	What about looking into donated breastmilk? I'm sure the doctor or the hospital could help you there. I would look at La Leche League too.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	Maybe you can give him both formula and breast milk while you are at work...I would try and get in touch with a lactation Specialist and see if they can help you to get your baby latching...its not to late..|`|XCNCvE5faa	First off you should not feel guilty, you did your best and should feel happy that you were able to provide your son with a good nutritious start. My baby is 3 months now and I had to stop pumping around a month and half. She is doing great on formula and it has been so much easier for me and my husband. My only suggestion is to still pump for awhile to so that you can gradually ween him off.|`|deIzFnV8aa	So one one hand I am all for the nutritional benefits of breastfeeding, but I also think it is very impt for you to be happy and not stressed out all the time. If going back to work does that, then consider that millions of babies are formula fed with no bad results, and your baby was lucky to have any breast milk.  What you could consider doing is feeding him a bit of both.  THis will mean you still have to pump :(, but hopefully much less!  And I don't know if this is a weird idea to you, but it might be possible to get donations of breast milk. I know some hosptials have a "milk bank", or if you know other nursing mom's, they might be willing to pump a little extra for you. I know I pump about 1 bottle extra every day for our DD, and there isn't anything I can really use the milk for after a certain point.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Are you trying to convince us that you have to quit pumping? I mean, it's your decision, right?    You can pump when you have the time.. For example, if you can pump once in the morning, once at lunch and once in the evening you already have 3 feeds for your son. It's supply on demand so as long as you pump those three times every day you'll have it for your son.
NxyTBTMvaa	condoms already protecting you by making sure that sperm doesnt go in you and birth control if using the right one which the pills in this case is 99.99%  that .01 is if you miss a pill you should be fine. when you use spermacide when there is no sperm going into you is probably not the best for your insides. and lubrication better of on the outside because to much in the inside could make the condom slip off.umm  a condom is really a condom as long as it still has air in the package . i just wouldnt trust no name really ,or flavored ,thier is something about flavored i heard that its not the best for sex. its good that you want to be safe ! condoms also protect you for certain STDS. have fun! hehe|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	Well, the most effective method would be to not have sex, of course.  Any other method has at least a slight chance of failure. However, using multiple methods certainly helps your odds.
fPAlfokHaa	It is very possible she could be..the pill is not fool proof and even though you may not have ejaculated, It is possible for Sperm to come out at anytime during sex. You normally get two pregnancy indicators in each kit so mayve if she did one any time over the next few days perhaps first thing in the morning and left the second one for a week or a few more days. If you still aren't convinced and want a mre definite answer a test done by your doctor is the answer|`|em8A42Bqaa	If thats the case it is possible that she missed taking the pill and threw off the cycle.  I've done that a couple of times..........prior to me getting pregnant, which is why I stopped taking them which is why Im going to be a mommy in MAY!|`|SKJb6eLKaa	Test now.. birth control is not 100% and every time you have sex there is a chance you'll get pregnant.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	it is possible, maybe she missed a pill or took it late. If she is 3 days late, she can test now.|`|AA11981363	You don't have to ejaculate in her to get her pg, while in "action" many of those little swimmers can come out in the precum and get her pg. If she is like a clockwork and is now 3 days late I say she could find out now. Buy a clearblue test and wait for 1st morning urine tomorrow to test. If she is pg it will show up almost right away.    Good luck|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	She can test now. Most test are 99% accurate up to 3 days BEFORE the missed period. And yes, even on the pill, she could be pregnant. it only takes one time ejaculating inside her for her to get pregnant. If she has a had a change in her physical routine that can also cause her to be lateas can stress. A pregnancy test should be accurate, you can pick them up at any grocery store or pharmacy.|`|ccFeMoFbaa	If you are really worried take a test now. I am on the pill and my period was like clockwork for two years then I missed my period one month. Was very worried, but everything was fine, I wasn't pregnant. So these things can happen, but she should take a test just to be sure.|`|Uu9qXGGuaa	There is a slight change that she is.  The pill isn't 100% grantee not to get your pregnant.  If she thinks she is pregnant, she needs to stop taking the pill.  If she doesn't, just keep taking the pill and it should come.  But if you are that scared, wait a couple of weeks and go to the doctor|`|AR683Nz6aa	test now, if she is late than ther is a possiability.

I never knew this until my 22 month old didnt fit in it with jackets on. So we got a double jogging stroller that holds up to 45 pounds each child.|`|d2b3e60bf991d4fa997560ee8cad58c7aa	I put my son in the jogging stroller with an infant seat attachment when he was born. I started putting him directly in the stroller when he was 6 months. Make sure the stroller you get has that option. I use a B.O.B. Good luck!|`|olF9Hl6saa	My son is 4 years old and 45 pounds. I still put him in the jogging stroller and he is just fine. He could walk by my side or ride his bike.... but not for long distances. Your 22 month old daughter should be fine for a while. Jogging strollers are usually designed for bigger children.
Xnr5Y7Coaa	This is just my personal opinion ok?    If it were me I would end this relationship, in part because of his views of abortion but mostly because he is the selfish one.  You are doing your part in taking contraceptives yet he refuses to use condom because his friends don't have to? What is he 5?    I think that if you were to get pregnant it will be your decision to keep it or not. Sure you can talk it over with him and all but the last word is yours and only yours.    I don't like this guy, I'm sorry but if you are in therapy because of this already what else can you expect down the road?    Think about all these things and make a decision about your relationship before you go any further. Good luck with everything.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You tell him that if he is so dead set against having children then he had damn well better use condoms AND spermicide EVERY single time he wants to have sex because YOU are the one who gets to make the decision to keep the baby and not abort.  He has no say in the matter.  How on earth can he think that YOU are being selfish?  What an *** HOLE!   He shouldn't be having sex if he doesn't want a kid.  Tell him to grow up or else leave him.  You can do so much better than him.|`|01vMpHkWaa	GET A NEW BOYFRIEND!!  he doesnt respect you or your family obviously|`|MLPzeOtOaa	If he is that much against having kids then he should get a vasectomy!!  Abortion SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL!!!    It can be SO damaging to the mother, both physically and psychologically. but hey! as long as he does not have to wear a condom, right?    The guy sounds like a serious jack-***!|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	This sounds like one battle you unfortunately will never win.  Obviously he is wrong, anyone with morals/values will agree with that.  You say you are in counseling and have had a rocky relationship, right?  Just think long and hard if you were to get pregnant...would you really want this person around your child?  I for sure wouldn't and I don't even know the guy.  I don't even think I would want to be friends with this person!  You sound like a smart girl and you have a good head on your shoulders.  I do not know you or your boyfriend, but from what I just read, I would say ditch the dude....you deserve MUCH better.|`|em8A42Bqaa	Well, he cant expect abortion to be a form of birth control.  Your post was long so I might've missed it, but you should take bc pills if you are sexually active and he isnt using a condom...you said the relationship was rocky.  Be smart!     It sounds like you know what to do, but maybe the guy that you are spending your time w/ is not as responsible??  IDK maybe you should not be thinking of kids.    I am pro choice and I dont know if I could bring a disabled child into this world if I had that choice, so I wont speculate on that.  Its a touchy subject.  IDK just be careful!|`|g9ZFjl6paa	honey i am so sorry to hear this! you shouldn't have an abortion over some stupid guy. there's always adoption. im against abortion and i know if i couldn't have kids i would love to have a baby and who knows it could be the one u are giving up. you need to find you a man that respects you and your family and everything you decide. i know you probably love him but trust me from past experiences no man is worth it when it comes down to having to choose to keep a baby or abort it. i would never have an abortion and was never told i would HAVE to by a ex i just know that if i did get pregnant none of them would have stuck around. and as far as his comment about being a "servant" he should love his child no matter if they had down syndrome or not. a child cant help how they are born they just want to be loved no matter what.     best of luck to you.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	My bit of advice is to find a boyfriend who has greater respect for you. He's saying, in clear terms, that your wishes are of no consequence to him, that your brother does not deserve to live, and that your life's work is worthless. Only perfect people--like him!--are entitled to breathe.    This is so diametrically opposed to who you are that it's no wonder your relationship is in trouble.    He's begging to be kicked to the curb. Seriously. Let him find some shallow woman who's a better match, and free yourself to be available for a man who has a functioning heart.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	If you and your boyfriend have these polar opposite views on pregnancy and abortion, it sounds like the two of you should not be having sex.  You mentioned that your relationship is rocky now, imagine how bad it would be if a pregnancy did occur, this would be a disastrous situation for a child.  I think you should find someone that shares your views on this important topic.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Well if your going to continue to sleep with him and stay in the relationship then all you can do is just not get pregnant or know he'll put you through hell if you do. And trust its hard enjoying your pregnancy when your partner doesn't want to keep the baby. Or you can find someone else to be with who shares the same values as you. Honestly he sounds like a jerk any way. But if you stay together i would just say expect the worse if you get pregnant. Be ready to do it with out him and if he changes his mind then that's even better. Good luck|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Dump him immediately. Do not wait.   He doesn't want children. You will have no happy future with this guy, especially since you and he are coming from 2 completely different directions where unplanned pregnancy is concerned.  Force him to wear the condom. He is lying when he says that girlfriends are "willing" to abort. NOBODY makes the decision to terminate a pregnancy lightly.|`|HpCmmlMFaa	Your boyfriend sounds like a horrible and selfish man, sorry to have to tell you the truth. He doesn't respect you or your family and only thinks of himself. He only thinks of his money, his life and his pride. He doesn't want a child because there's a chance it could be disabled and he would care more about what other people would think of this child rather then loving it more than anything in the world. But it does sound like your relationship is coming to a end, therapy is never a good sign.   I hope this helped andi really hope you find a better man that will think more about you then himself. Good luck :)|`|FgAPXhVRaa	My EX and I were the same way... except we had a really great relationship for two years. Then one day out of the blue he told me that f I ever got pregnant, he would want me to have an abortion... I did not understand why and we had a long talk about it. I told him that if I were to become pregnant that I would want to keep it because I am an adult and know that I have the capability of taking care of it. Well shortly after that, ironically enough, we found out I was pregnant, and his mind did not change. He was even more set on me having an abortion... now we are no longer together and he wants nothing to do with our precious little girl that I am pregnant with. If he has made it clear to you about his opinions, I really believe that it is safer to break up at this point. He will not change his mind, trust me. Even if he does it will be later. Now I am just basing this off experience... but it is much harder to have a mean ex, who talks about still wanting me to have an abortion at 22 weeks then having an ex boyfriend with no commitments. Just be careful with selfish guys like this who are unwilling to be sympathetic to your opinions. Anyway, please just in case save yourself the heartache. I am very happy that I am having my precious little girl but it has been a hard uphill battle with my ex... and he sounds so very similar to your boyfriend... please be careful! :) and good luck!|`|6mhFHSRSaa	It sounds to me like you have a couple of things to think about, and that you are in therapy is a great sign, under the circumstances. Here are a few of my non-professional observations based on what you said.    1. You seem to have different values when it comes to the range of human life. While you value letting people make choices about their own reproduction, you also value lives that others may view as imperfect. My opinion, having worked with disabled children for almost 10 years, is that you have the "right" view of people whose abilities and limitations are different. (But my opinion doesn't matter much!) This is a rather deep value, and I tend to think that values like this ought to be shared with a life partner if at all possible, especially if there is a possibility of your having children together at any point. You may have to face that choice together about your own child, and if you are in a committed relationship and cannot agree about how you will treat the pregnancy and the child that results from it, that is likely to be a huge stress on your relationship. That said, your boyfriend might change his tune when the child is his and he falls in love with it, but there's no guarantee of that. You may wish to think about how important this valuing of life is to you, and whether you can love, respect and cooperate with a life partner who may urge you to terminate a pregnancy or to seek treatment for a disabled child outside of your home. Long-term relationships tend to magnify problems, especially in times of stress. Is this a source of tension that you can live with? For me, that value is too deep to be a point of compromise. For you, it may or may not be. It's time to examine yourself honestly.    2. The "selfish" card really shouldn't be played in this most serious game. Sure, in some sense it may be selfish for you to want to keep a child in your womb, but I think it is easy to argue that it is selfish of your boyfriend to want to deprive you of your child for the sake of his future income or comfort. That's why discussing what is selfish is irrelevant - if you don't agree on what to do about an unplanned pregnancy, then each will think the other is selfish. Ultimately, of course, our laws state that you have the right to make that choice since the child is growing in your body. If you are already certain that you would want to keep a pregnancy, then that is something that bears discussing. Frankly, I don't think it is unfair for you to ask a man to take precautions against pregnancy, even if you are already on contraceptives. That he would object to condoms on the grounds that "other guys don't have to" is rather immature, and that he then refers to abortion as a possibility as the rest of his excuse tells me that he thinks of abortion as a quick fix birth control option. Something tells me you don't view it that way for yourself. Here's another rather major difference in values, and something you may want to think about seriously. On the one hand, I understand his point of view... on the other, when we become adults and have to make adult decisions about sexuality and the lives of others, then we must be willing to realize that our actions have consequences, and we must be willing to face them. In this case, the ultimate decision lies in your hands. That fact may make a guy feel powerless, but a responsible person will either decide that the sexual activity is worth the risk because he wants to be with you, and he'll deal with the baby if it comes; or he will decide that he'd rather be with someone who shares his views; or he will take precautions himself.     3. I've talked a lot about his responsible behavior in this situation, but really I am most concerned about you. You are the one asking the question, and you are the one with whom the choice will lie if your hypothetical question becomes one of real life. It may be worth thinking about whether this relationship is what you want it to be and whether it is worth salvaging. I spent 4 1/2 years with a guy that I loved dearly and wanted to marry, but in the end, when I was honest with myself, I had to decide that the relationship wasn't right for me. Our disagreements and issues were different, but it boiled down to what we each wanted in life. When you have deep values that you do not share, it's worth exploring whether the relationship is worth clinging to, or whether clinging to it is keeping you from finding someone else who will share your values. I have never regretted letting go, because several years later I met the "right" one. This relationship is worth the fight, the other one was not. It took me several years to figure that out, but once I met the right guy, the difference was amazing.    Best of luck to you! These are just some thoughts off the top of my head. My best advice to you is to really make use of the opportunity you have in therapy to explore what you want and whether this relationship is the right one.|`|I4KE3KBjaa	Quit having sex with him. He sounds no good. What if you did get pregnant and kept the baby? He sounds like he would be a lousy and selfish father. Don't risk putting yourself through that.|`|zCqpYQ4oaa	Sounds like this is a fundamental disagreement and that it probably won't be resolved. You should probably begin soul searching to determine if you really want to be with someone like him. If you are in a long term relationship (which I'm assuming you are because you're taking it serious enough to get therapy), I'm guessing he's not going to change. I know it's hurtful, but you have to decide what's right for you. I speak from experience. I had a bf almost exactly like this and it took a very harsh slap in the face (figuratively) to make me realize that I was wasting my time.|`|VQifKNfgaa	WOW. He sounds like he only cares about himself. If he is man enough to have a sexual relationship, then he sould be man enough to take care of his child if you become pregnant.  I WOULD NOT TAKE THAT!!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	he sounds like a dead-beat no good loser. dump him and get a new guy.|`|fPAlfokHaa	Ok firstly, you can never predict how you will react to a situation until it happens so for him to be adamant about abortion is ridiculous. I had a boyfriend who always said that. Now that I am pregnant with my now boyfriends baby, he says that he would never have gone for an abortion. funny huh?  As for him saying he shouldnt have to wear a condom because his friends dont as their girlfriends are willing to abort, tell him that you arent willing to abort so unless he wants you having half his income for the next 18 years he's going to have to take on a little responsibility or have to pay that price.   All in all he sounds like a bit of an asshole who isn't showing very much respect to your views or to your own brother, who you seem to care for very much. He sounds selfish and immature and i htink you are better off without him.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Im sorry hon, but your bf sounds like a major ***. He's the selfish one, to expect you to have an abortion if you got pregnant. He just doesn't want the responsibility. I would recommend leaving him. You don't want to be with someone like that. He has no respect at all. Also, of course you can be proud of a child that is handicapped. The fact that he would say that a child like that is worthless is just horrible. Its not the kids fault that they are born like  that. Anyway. sorry bout the rant. It just makes me mad to hear about how guys being so selfish and mean. good luck|`|AR683Nz6aa	get rid of him|`|l4H81i7Naa	trade your boyfriend in for a better one. no man can make a woman get an abortion. if he claims to be pro-choice tell him it is your choice not his. you have the vagina and he doesn't so it is all up to you hun!
qfUjrcCvaa	That is a very pretty name!!! I have always loved the name Maddison !!! :)|`|64aMfHFBaa	not too keen on maddison, since it's so commonly used for babies right now, but that does sound pretty cool|`|U7SnmcxYaa	I LIKE ITTTT :D|`|SRyQmowFaa	Oh i like it|`|zYeBQZB5aa	Eeew. Sounds cliche and cheap.|`|bRAmXcowaa	very cute. and should work through all age groups which is important.<br>  she will probably get maddie for short which is also nice|`|nftcTLXKaa	hah it would be a lot better with 1 "D" though.. Madison Marie. it would look a lot better in my opinion. :]|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I LOVE the name 'Madison' (spelt with one D) BUT I don't like it very much with Marie. I'm not a huge fan of doublt initials like 'MM'. I think something like 'Madison Grace' sounds a lot better. Each to their own though & Madisons a gorgeous name.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Maddison is a bit too common for my taste, but it flows well with Marie.  If you love it, go for it.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't like it sorry. I don't like Maddison at all - especially spelled with two d's. And I don't care for Marie either, sorry.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	So pretty !
