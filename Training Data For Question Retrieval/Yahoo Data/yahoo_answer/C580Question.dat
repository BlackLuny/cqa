After tests, ultrasounds on so on they told me I had a detached placenta and that I had to rest. If my placenta completely detaches, where there goes my baby, and I would have a real miscarriage.      What am I supposed to do at this moment?   Has anyone been through something like this or similar?   What can I and CAN NOT do?

I pee more the less I eat, but even if I eat a lot I tend to tinkle more than normal and often get up once or twice out of bed before I can fall asleep. During school I have to consciously not drink in the hour before going into class/lecture otherwise there is no doubt I will be bursting to pee halfway through (even if I only take a few big sips of water). And if I drink tea or another hot drink, there's no point in me leaving the house til about an hour later...      Anyway, other (most) people I know can go for the whole day without peeing, and they don't feel an increased need to pee after hot drinks, and never have to worry about getting up in class! Do they just have bigger bladders? (I'm 5'9" though)      Btw I don't remember if it's been like this my whole life, but I only consciously noticed recently. I doubt it would suddenly develop?

It was very spur of the moment, so I did not buy any aftercare products because I had to leave as soon as it was done. They lady that did it simply told me to clean it with alcohol 2 times a day. I just did some research online and they told me not to clean it with alcohol. So.. I was wondering what at-home products can I use to clean it, I have no money so I can't just go out to the store, I would ask my mom but she would kill me once she finds out. And since I cant use alcohol, can I use peroxide? help?

I have had clean paps for years, I'm 24, have a 16 month old son and am engaged to be married in four weeks...obviously I'm devastated. I'm waiting on my colpscopy results, but what does this mean for my marriage. Even If it's not a severe strain, whoever had it first, we obviously both have it now. Does this mean we are sentenced to condoms forever since he will always be transferring it back to me, even if the strain I have now clears? What about my son, could he have it if this is something I have had dormant for years? Does this mean my fiance and I can't have oral sex because we could get throat problems relating to the HPV?? I was looking forward to marriage and blissful sex without condoms (why I went to the gyno in the first place was to get an IUD as birth control). Now what? Worst case, cancer, but best case is warts, condoms forever and passing this on to my child and future children??? So confused....

So then, maybe 2, 3 weeks later I had a period, and that was great and all, but it wasn't even remotely normal. Every hour or so (and excuse me--men especially--, this is a bit explicit) I would lose huge blood clots, and the cramping was the worst I've ever experienced. So, I don't know. And now, about 3, 4 weeks after that, I'm having signs of a normal pregnancy. Is there any chance that I'm pregnant? Haven't had unprotected sex since the 'time in question'.

I put my fingers on the heart rate monitors on the elliptical trainer at the gym...by the time I go on it to cool down, my heart is usually racing because I've just finished an intense weight lifting workout, and then I'm running on the elliptical.

I'm 21 and my 80% target intensity heart rate was listed as 160...but my heart rate is usually around 190 on the machine.  Is that too high?  My resting heart rate is around 60-65, and my blood pressure is around 135/70.

Je pensais au stress, mais mon médecin n'est pas d'accord car je me réveille la nuit pour vomir donc, pour lui, il n'y a pas de facteur de stress déclenchant (quand tu dors, tu n'es pas stressé). Je bois du bouillon et mange très peu (parfois un yogourt par jour) mais ?a continue. J'ai perdu 6kg en 15 jours, suis déshydratée, tension à 7/4. Me suis déjà fait hospitaliser(ils n'ont rien trouvé). J'aimerais surtout comprendre la cause. Avez-vous vécu une expérience semblable ou avez-vous une idée de ce qui se passe?

Cette nuit encore j'ai eu droit à un petit changement, mes dents se cassaient sans raison, se dédoublaient et pour certaines finissaient par tomber. Je sais que je fais ce rêve au moins 4 à 5 fois par mois mais à chaque fois que j'y ai droit j'ai vraiment l'impression que c'est la réalité et c'est affreux. Cette nuit je ramassais les bouts de dents qui tombaient de ma bouche et les gardais précieusement comme avec un espoir de pouvoir les remettre... Je ne crois pas trop aux significations des rêves, je ne suis pas vraiment supersticieuse mais ce rêve là me hante et j'aimerai savoir si celà vous arrive aussi et surtout ce que vous en pensez...

I get Asked alot "how tall do you wish you were?" and I don't wish I were taller.      So.. How tall are you and how do you feel about it? Can you also give age because if you say 4' 9" and you're 12 then that's probably just average height. I'm talking people who are taller or shorter than other people around they're age. Okay?      P.S. I do know that sometimes people who are tall are not happy with it either, and people just assume they are. So PLEASE don't yell at me for not seeing both sides of the spectrum because I do see both sides. And I want to know mor eabout the 2 extremes so I can better understand people.

Having finally worked up the courage to book a dentist appointment (my last one ended up with my in tears while the dentist gave me a filling with no needle and asking him to stop!), I had finally got my head around having to go... and that was for an appointment one month from today!      I have some calcular deposits on my insde lower teeth, and last night while I was flossing I accidently slipped my fingernail under the edge of a deposit and pulled.  End result - big chunk of hard calculus/tartar/plaque whatever you call it has come off my tooth!  Now my tooth looks all white and new underneath!!      HOWEVER!  Even though it doesnt hurt at all, the edges feel a little sharp and I know I need to go to the dentist this weekend before I spend my whole overseas trip prodding at my tooth!  It also looks like the deposit was pushing down into my gum a little.. but my tooth roots arent exposed.  Gum just feels a little lower than what it should be I spose.      Does anyone know what Im talking about and what they will do when I go to the dentist?

I do spinning/studio cycling twice a week, swimming for an hour twice a week, around 2-4 miles walking every day, 30-40 minutes on the crosstrainer or treadmill on Tuesdays and mini aerobic fitness classes three times a week.

Snack: Mushrooms with houmous.   Dinner: Salmon with broccoli, cauliflower and kale.   Dessert: Small pot of fromage frais.      I make sure not to eat over 1400 calories a day.      Am I on the right track? For a few weeks now I have seemed to lose nothing in weight...although people have told me this may be because I've gained muscle.      Is there anything I can do to speed up the weight loss (healthily) and enhance my metabolism?

20080105190122AA3evjd	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	How long should I not put weight on a bad sprain?	I sprained my ankle last week, then I resprained a different part of it last week when I slipped on the ice. I'm on crutches, in an air cast, and also on two different pain killers. The first time I went to my dr,she wrapped it in an ace bandage and said use the crutches for a week. The second I went to the er (as my co-workers where I did it thought it was fractured) and at the er to continue with the crutches, but did not tell me for how long. I'm going to try to follow up with my pcp, but I'm just wondering if anyone had any idea how long of non-weight bearing for a bad sprain? And is it possible to sprain your foot and your ankle? The first time I hurt the outside, and the second time I really hurt the inside of it. The inside honestly hurts more than the outside of it.
