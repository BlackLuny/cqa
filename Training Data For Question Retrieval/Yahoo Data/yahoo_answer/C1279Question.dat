20090306222742AATtPJl	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How can we perceive 5th and more dimensional concept?	Generally we can understand mathematically upto 3rd dimension. As per Mathematician Reimann there exist n-number of dimensions. The 4th dimension is the time as per Sir Alber Einstien. So, How can we perceive or visualize higher dimension. From Michio Kaku's book of Introduction of 10th dimension I could understand there exist higher dimensions. Even after the death the soul exist immediately at 5th & 6 th dimension. Then it can move to hihger dimension as the energy it gains or possesses. The rest we can discuss latter. Thanx.

20090307015816AAflxeQ	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Trying to Conceive: Do all antimicrobials kill sperm? Even if it's a natural ingredient?	I've recently found a study that said that major personal lubricant brands (such as KY, Astroglide, etc.) that claim to not contain any spermicides do in fact kill sperm. In my search to find a different natural lubricant I came across several that contain natural antimicrobials (such as Lactoperoxidase). I know that many vaginal spermicides are antimicrobial, but does that mean that anything with that property will have that same effect? I am trying to conceive and do not want this to be an inhibiting factor. Also, if you know of any lubricants that would suit my needs please suggest! Thanks!

P(A) = {Null set, {1},{2},{1,2}}   P(C) = {Null set, {1},{2},{3},{1,2}, {1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}   X ∈ P (C), X ∈ {Null set, {1},{2},{3},{1,2}, {1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}   If  X = {1,2} then X ∩ A = {1,2} = A   If X ={1}, then X ∩ A = {1}   If X ={2}, then X ∩ A = {2}   If X =Null Set, then X ∩ A = Null Set   but X is only an element not all the elements. Then I say that the statement is false. Am I on the right track?

20090307043001AAqoVQn	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	It is claimed Godels incompleteness theorem is invalid-what do you think?	It is argued Godel uses the invalid axiom of reducibility in his proof thus his theorem is invalid       http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/boo...       It goes on to say that    Some say Godel did not use the axiom of reducibility   Godels paper is called    On formally undecidable propositions of Principia. Mathematica and related systems    if godel does not use axioms from PM then his paper cannot be about undecidable propositions in PM-thus he misleads us       if Godel  does not use AR then  what axioms from PM   does he use. If he uses none  then his paper is not about undecidable propositions in PM and he is lying when he says    “ ...(we limit ourselves here to the system PM) …”      so if you argue that he does not use AR please tell us just what axioms Godel does use from PM   take in mind godels tells us      we limit ourselves here to thesystem PM)       and his system he says uses axioms from PM      “P is essentially the system obtained by superimposing on the Peano axioms the logic of PM      so if you say he does not use AR then please tell us  what axiom he uses from PM

20090307042715AA3ySa2	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	It is cliamed Godels incompleteness theorem is invalid-what do you think?	It is argued Godel uses the invalid axiom of reducibility in his proof thus his theorem is invalid       http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/boo...       It goes on to say that    Some say Godel did not use the axiom of reducibility   Godels paper is called    On formally undecidable propositions of Principia. Mathematica and related systems    if godel does not use axioms from PM then his paper cannot be about undecidable propositions in PM-thus he misleads us       if Godel  does not use AR then  what axioms from PM   does he use. If he uses none  then his paper is not about undecidable propositions in PM and he is lying when he says    “ ...(we limit ourselves here to the system PM) …”      so if you argue that he does not use AR please tell us just what axioms Godel does use from PM   take in mind godels tells us      we limit ourselves here to thesystem PM)       and his system he says uses axioms from PM      “P is essentially the system obtained by superimposing on the Peano axioms the logic of PM      so if you say he does not use AR then tell us what axioms from PM he does use

20090307045115AAecKyP	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Help on complicated maths question?	When working with powers, I know that the rule for a fraction to the minus fraction = the appropriate root of both the denominator and the numerator and then invert to fraction. For example:      (4/9)^-1/2 (find the square root of 4/9)      = (2/3)^-1 (invert the fraction)      = 3/2 = 1.5      But say you had a an example of this question:      (4/9)^-2/2      This would mean the same procedure of finding the square root of 4/9 which is 2/3. But then you'd have:      (2/3)^ -2      This would mean you can't just simply invert the fraction. So how would you find the power of minus 2?      Thanks

The laws of time travel state that if someone is killed in the past everything that was meant to happen after that time that involves that individual's actions and existence are cut off and to be made as if they never existed after that point because that person basically isn't alive anymore to go through that time stream.       So my question is, if a man time travels into the past and finds his 'past self" then proceeds to shoot him in the face, how is this even possible from the rule stated above?       If the man travels into the past and shoots his "past self" then he could cut off everything he did after that past instance and he would therefore never be able to become his present self to travel back in time and shoot himself.

20090307061953AA6Zyef	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Can someone explain the physics of electrolysis?	I investigated copper sulphate electrolysis with copper electrodes.      I looked at how much mass change occured with the electrodes over a 10 minute period.      I varied the distance between the electrodes to see what effect this had.      The further apart they were, hte less mass change occured.         I'm told that by increasing the distance between the electrodes I also increased the resistance. However, wouldnt this also increase the voltage (as voltage is proportional to resistance) and so increase the amount of copper formed and lost?      Pleeeease someone try and explain!

20090307061406AAvZWRC	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Global Warming and the Earth?	It seems you can turn on the news without hearing 'the dangers of global warming.' Between People protesting at airports or melting icecaps, and environmentalists saying that unless we stop global warming it will destroy the planet.      But I remember watching that Earth: The Power of the Planet with Ian Stewart (I have the book from the series) and at the end of the last chapter it says... Humans operate on a different timescales to the planet. The world we evolved into had coral reefs, rainforest's, and ice at the poles. In changing this world we are altering the environment that allow our species to flourish. Just like the dinosaurs before us, who die out as the Chixculub meteorite hit, we can't cope with the sudden change. And this time its us, not the dinosaurs at the top of the food chain.      So, all this stuff about 'saving planet Earth'. That's nonsense. That's not the problem. Planet Earth doesn't need saving. For four and half billion years, Earth has been a survivor. Its not the planet we should be worrying about. Its us.      So is Ian Stewart right, is it the human race who is in danger and not the planet?

I am tutoring someone about the PH scale, and I need to tell him strong acids. But it would be MUCH more helpful for both him and me if we could find out what makes an acid strong just by looking at the empirical formula. for example- could you draw the compound and tell? can you determine the charges of the elements in the acid and determine if it will completely dissociate? I know that there HAS to be a way... It would also be helpful if you can give the converse- what makes an acid weak... (why)   Thanks in advance!    5/5 for an answer that satisfies the question in anyway

The mass of the gas molecules is negligible.   The collisions between the molecules are elastic.   The molecules travel at slow speeds.   The volume of the gas molecules is negligible.   The intermolecular forces are negligible.   The speed of the molecules is not dependent on the temperature.      It can be more than one choice. So far I have the volume, collisions, mass, and intermolecular forces. Please tell me if I am right.

20090307075440AAqvghQ	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Is our level of technology sufficient to locate Earth-like planets?	An interesting web-site:  http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cf...       Shows that there are 342 planets outside our solar system that are found, and that 289 stars have planets. But also on the site, it indicates that the smallest planet located outside our solar system is larger than twice the size of Earth.      So my question, is our level of technology good enough to find planets as small as Earth? Is there a chance that our closest neighbour star might have an Earth orbiting it but we just can't spot it yet?      Also, if we did find a planet today in the 'goldilocks' zone, and of the proper size, is our level of technology good enough to determine if there is water, or even life on that planet?
