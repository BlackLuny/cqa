dji8alFWaa	Unless it's a test, or a quiz... I'm sure teachers don't mind kids getting a bit of online tutoring. It's not illegal, yet! And as far as I know, turnitin only checks things in its database... the question is what, exactly is in its database....|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Yes, it will show up on the verification scores, and the professor has the right to choose whether or not he/she will find out where the information has come from that is considered possible plagiarism (such as yahoo answers).      Yes, teachers have picked up on it (I go to online college myself), but most that I have asked about this say they are fine with them asking for clarifications or to help find resources, as long as they don't copy the answer.  It's ok to be used as a learning tool...not as a "cheat sheet".

It matters in homework but not real life because no one knows or cares if they use the right grammar.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Though both are commonly used, "eaten" would be the correct tense in this case.

kQKFfZAmaa	the distance from the midpoint to the other endpoint is exactly the same as from the midpoint to the given endpoint (you know this because the midpoint is exactly in the middle)    so - if the x distance from R - M is -3 and the y axis distance is +5 you can use that to figure out the other endpoint  (-3, 10)|`|CKDzsiFXaa	i really have no idea, maybe you could try and put (1,0) because it's the difference between r and m?|`|y5V0K4Wxaa	to start, line RS has the midpoint of M, so to get from point R to point M you simply go -5 units on the y axis and 3 units on the x axis. Since M is the midpoint, to get the the other endpoint (S) just go another -5 units y and 3 units x. It is easy to see when done on paper.

83cIZKwNaa	The defining quality of being an American is the right to freedom and liberty. Though other countries may value freedom and liberty just as highly as we do, America is arguably the pioneer of modern democracy. While an American literally refers to an inhabitant of the United States of America, there are certain prominent and undeniable aspects defined by society as American.  The word Americans is accompanied by numerous stereotypes; some, if not many, of which are factual. It is socially acceptable to pay four dollars every morning for a cup of Starbucks coffee. Its ok for 13 year old girls, influenced largely by the liberal media and their distorted views, to wear makeup and idolize talentless teenage actors on the Disney channel.  Americans commonly voice their own opinions; freedom of speech allows us to do so. However, opinions concerning politics are redundant if were under 18 or ineligible to vote. Freedom of speech has paved the way for more and more whiny politically correct left wingers.  Freedom in America is a paradox if you think about it; our self-proclaimed land of opportunity isnt much different than any other country. Like everyone else, there are exceptions to our freedom. Explicit language is banned from public television and radio. I cannot (legally) consume an alcoholic beverage until Im 21. Pornography requires a government grant. Of course all these laws are in place for a reason, but it goes to disprove the misguided views of those who believe Americans are truly free.|`|ZJZ7JhyNaa	you're obese and enjoy eating big macs.|`|BuxDT0Akaa	go to Mc Donalds|`|MPeSbXSaaa	You live in america.|`|RvEnbEJcaa	Americans are civilized people who are not American because they live In America, it's because they are men. Indians are awesome.......... too!|`|WpJ43kHjaa	I think it means to be kind towards other people; I also think it means to be from many nationalities. I've had people say to me, "You are un-American" because I don't like football. I always respond that American is not a true nationality.......it's a mix of them. I guess today, other countries also assume that Americans are stupid, fat, or lazy, which if you think about it, isn't that far from reality. 42% of adults cannot name the first, third, sixteenth, fourt-third, and current president.
0aJlEmIxaa	Bernard Baruch in response to a question by Igor Cassini as to how he handled the seating arrangements at his dinner parties, as quoted in Shake Well Before Using: A New Collection of Impressions and Anecdotes Mostly Humorous (1948) by Bennett Cerf, p. 249; the full response was "I never bother about that. Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter." This anecdote is also quoted online at Chiasmus.com. It has also become part of a larger expression, which has been commonly attributed to Dr. Seuss, even in print, but without citation of a specific work: "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."
CKDzsiFXaa	its an hour because the rule applys to the SOUNDS of the begining of the word not the letter|`|jSxoN9fKaa	It's "An Hour" because usually you use an instead of a when the word starts with a vowel.

3zGxlguhaa	It depends entirely on the school you are going to attend. Some place a heavy emphasis on business core classes while others are more liberal arts focused. You should consult your school's course booklet to find out more.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	it depends on your major and the college. you might look into calling your school/schools of choice and asking what some required classes are for freshman, and look online to see you major requirements at your school.     taking an AP Psych will almost certainly help you...most schools require psychology, so if you get credit (AP Test,) by doing that in high school, you'll be further ahead. =)|`|9BOqKx52aa	Your standing as a freshmen or sophomore at most schools is dependent on how many credit hours you have passed.  For most schools (well any college I know about) you need more then 30 hours to be considered a sophomore.  As far as what classes to take you need to talk to your academic adviser to figure that out.|`|QDEId9Asaa	take into mind, some colleges won't offer credit and/or waive courses for courses taken during high school  (eg Stanford, UCs, Harvard, Duke, USC, Johns Hopkin, etc)    I would take Math, not history cause some schools dont need that, Art, not english (cause some schools require writing to be taken at their school, ) and stuff like that

70AGy17eaa	I think so
ORonhAuvaa	Actually I am not sure the secretary is the best person for determining autism. It is really not appropriate for her to have this discussion, much less make a diagnosis.     You don't need a medical diagnosis to provide services to this child. You can ask the parent to sign for an autism rating scale such as the GARS or observation by a district autism specialist. As you mentioned, he will be coming off DD and for that, he will receive full psychological testing. The school pysch will pick up on it if he is autistic. He will also have Sp/L and OT testing as well.     If you have not already requested the testing, check off "social emotional" as well because you will need that to send him to a class for behavior. You should also request a Functional Behavior Assessment and write a behavior intervention plan immediately. You are not going to be able to move him any place without them.    There is absolutely nothing to prevent you from providing visual prompts if you think they are necessary or whatever else will benefit him in the regular classroom. That is one good thing about an FBA. It will give some information about what he needs for modifications and accommodations.    Exceptionality doesn't drive placement. Priority educational need drives placement. If that is behavior, then maybe a behavior class is where he needs to be. You said he could carry on a basic conversation, so that means he is at least a high functioning autistic child. He is receiving Speech and Language services, so that is what would be happening if he was in an autism class. What he needs is social skills instruction. Though it would be better to have them in an AU room, IF he is autistic, it may be that his behavior needs to be under control before anything.    I think you are taking too much on yourself. As a voice alone, you probably cannot convince her. However, once you have all his DD testing in, there will be a variety of educators who will be giving her information, Also, the IEP team will decide what will serve him best, so that takes the onus off of you.    Since autism is the flavor of the century, we are getting a ton of requests for autism evaluations in my school district. 90% of those kids are not autistic. Remember that autism is a profound social and communication disorder. Children will have many issues and there are some kids who flap and stim that are not autistic.  Autistic kids have severe digestive issues, feeding issues and very ritualistic behavior. Some of the kids who are being evaluated end up being seriously language impaired or seriously emotionally disturbed by an abusive situation. Others are mildly intellectually disabled.    Mom can run, but she can't hide. If he is autistic, it will catch up with him sooner or later.|`|yPLS0FeWaa	Considering this child is in special ed, I'm assuming he has an IEP or 504 Plan in place. One the things that need to be considered in an IEP/504 Plan is accommodations, modifications, supplementary services, and related services, he should be able to receive visual aids without an official diagnosis of autism. I understand he is in speech, but has he been assessed for OT (occupational therapy). In most cases with autism, their behavior is some form of communication, and there's a good chance he may have sensory integration disorder which can lead to behaviorial outbursts, even if he don't have autism he could still have sensory issues. That can be helped through OT and speech and through modifications and accommodations. Another thing that should be addressed in an IEP/504 Plan is the child's behavior, it should include any intervention, accommodation, modification, strategy, and support to help him learn to control or manage his behavior in a positive way. The school may choose to do a functional behavior assessment to address his behavior and come up with a behaviorial intervention plan seperatly or to be added to his IEP/504 Plan.    I don't think anyone wants their child diagnosed with autism, but if they are it is not the end of the world. Maybe you could show her the 'bright side'  of autism. Such as if she would choose to have him assessed and if found to have autism, the earlier he receives all the services he needs the more likely he will live a very normal life as he gets older (this has been proven). Letting her know that there is all kinds of help for her son and herself/family if he is autistic. Maybe she don't understand autism itself and needs guidance in that area. I think one the more important factors if he is autistic she needs to know that it is not by any means her fault. Maybe let her know that you are not trying to diagnose her child but make her aware that there is 'more than meets the eye' and in order to help him succeed in school and life he needs to be assessed for autism to see if he does have it or to rule it out and look into him having something else, a processs of elimination. Perhaps make a list of famous people who are on the autism spectrum including autistic savants, although her child may not be come famous or a savant, it can help showing her that those on the spectrum can accel in life whether they are on the mild side or the severe side of the spectrum. Most people on the spectrum accel in art, music, and math; and have unbelievable memory skills. I know of a couple of sites, one has great information about accommodations and two others have some great resources for teachers to use in the classroom for those on the spectrum or with LD's. Resources you can use and I believe most are free (I haven't checked out all the sites listed yet) from visual aids, software, social stories, and more. Contact me through my profile and I'd be more than happy to send the links your way. Kudos to you for having such a great interest in this child to be sure he receives the help he needs :-) good luck!|`|r3DrSY1Vaa	It's great that you want to help him in the classroom, but that said it's not your job to push a mother to get a diagnosis, especially one like autism. Since you see he needs visual aids and extra support, would you be willing to give those things to him without a diagnosis?       It's hard to work with parents who don't want to have specific labels for their children but for those of us who work with kids we need to just focus on the child and not just getting a diagnosis for a child.     I would advise you to just keep working with him as much as possible and perhaps asking the special ed teacher or speech-language pathologist to give you materials that you could pass on to the mom.    Hope this helps!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	The child's needs aren't going to be changed by a dx.  Tell her he would qualify for other resources he just needs the assessment and that the earlier he gets the resources the better his long term functioning level will be.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	what a great example of beaurocracy-    schools claim they don't honor medical prescriptions--and only approve special ed services based on their own evaluation-yet they want a medical diagnosis to give services...    there is a bigger problem her--the parent is negelectign teh child-a parent has a duty to provide appropriate medical care for a child (autism or not)---being that she is outright refusing ANY medical care-that is neglect-and technically you ar required to report her to child services-    it would be great if you could arrange a chance meeting between a parent with a child with autiam and thsi mother--and have that parent casually let her know it wasn't devastating to get the diagnosis and are glad tehy did and how muchbetter things are now....    does the school have a social worker?  can the social worker express the schools position of being required to report her for neglect--but would rather help her through this without child services    whats with teh thumbs down--you may not like it-but its true--schools do take both sides-saying a medical diagnosis is not important-but you need a diagnosis to get full services-    and it is true that if teh child is harmed by lack of medical attention-a school canbe held liable fro failure to report suspected abuse--they can even be in trouble if nothing happens to the child (rarely are people prosecuted for failure to report when there is no harm done)|`|KJzjfWHwaa	If mom isn't willing to have her son screened for autism through the district, I would try to get as many services you can for him through his diagnosis of speech delay.  Perhaps you could convince the mom to allow her son to attend as much as half the day in resource, which would be more beneficial to the boy since it will be a smaller group with specialized teachers.    I've been on both sides of this situation--as a teacher and a parent.  Never thought it could happen to me--until my son was born.  Make sure you try to empathize with mom.  Let her know that even if he is evaluated and qualifies for other services by way of an "autism" diagnosis, everyone is still going to work hard to help her son reach his potential.  I suspect that part of mom's fear comes from the idea that if her child is "labeled" (which you and I both know he will be) that the education system will write him off.      Good luck.  :)|`|2756b6757618ae6c3d9a70deb469e33caa	Can the teacher, specialist, or principal refer this student to the school's student study team?  I think most schools have these meetings and the parent is invited.  Group discusses the challening behavior and talks about solutions (tutoring, small group instruction, sitting student close to teacher's desk or board, additional time to complete assignments, incentives/token board), etc...    IF behaviors do not improve, then team meets again and if it is believed child will benefit from further evaluation AND parent agrees, then parent signs consent for district to test child to determine eligibility for special education services.  IF parent does NOT consent, then child is NOT evaluated for special education services.      PLEASE be careful how staff responds to this particular parent.  I know it is VERY difficult to see a child who might need additional support.  If a parent feels pressured by staff, then you risk creating a confrontational situation.  It is best to approach this matter carefully and respectfully.  Have the student's teacher document (daily) the behaviors the child demonstrates, how many times the child required re-direction, or additional support.  Do not make this a witch hunt where the desired result is getting this kid into a special education class.  This child may or may not have the ability to succeed in general education with certain supports set into place.  How about using picture cards around the classroom?  Can you work with this teacher to brainstorm ideas to help this student?  I TOTALLY understand that a diagnosis is the key to additional services.  Until then, this might be the road you need to take.

n0VqtKIOaa	I would not recommend this path.  The nursing program has barely any classes (if any) that will count toward the pre-requisites for optometry school.  If you go to the optometry schools' websites -the link is listed below-, most will require you to take level a 300 biochemistry, organic 1 and 2, and anatomy and physiology 1 and 2.  Also, some require you to take a higher level physics and a calculus course.      In the nursing program, you will be taking mostly intro biology, biochem, and math courses.  These courses are level 100-200 and wont count toward the pre-requisites.    Here is my suggestion.  Get a bachelor degree in a biology related field -- ie applied biology, life science, biomedical science, human science, etc.  These degrees will fulfill all the pre-reqs to optometry school.  Honestly, it isnt too difficult to get into the program.  You will just need to get a GPA of above a 3.5 and an oat score of 330+.  Work hard and you can do it.
ejl41Ci3aa	I know you'll hate to hear this, but the best and simplest way to do better is to just sit down and study. Get organized. A possible problem may be is that whenever you get handouts and information, you simply stuff it away and forget about it. Get subject binders, and everything your teachers give you, put it in there. Also take notes. It may seem like such a pain during class, but your teachers will like that you do this, and when you get together your materials for studying, you will have all the information necessary. Another tactic is to set up a study/homework schedule with your parents, checking in with them every so often so they can keep you on track.

02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	I think the movies that you mentioned put a misconception to what college life should be like. Yes, some people go off to college and are involved in parties, drinking, drugs, and sex. Others focus on the education aspect of it.     For me, college was more about learning. I had no desire to go to clubs or get drunk. I wanted to get my education and didn't want to waste my parents money. I went to a private college so the tuition wasn't cheap. Besides, I wanted to keep my grades up so that I could have the option of going on to graduate school. I did spend more time on my major than socializing (majored in Ecology). Don't get me wrong I did attend basketball games and I was involved in clubs and organizations (photographer for school newspaper, FCA, Tri-Beta, etc.).

83cIZKwNaa	What does it mean to be a lesbian?    Lesbians are women-loving-women. We are women who are sexually attracted to other women. We are women who may feel emotionally and spiritually closer to women. We are women who prefer women as our partners.    As lesbians, we are not alone. One out of ten teenagers is lesbian or gay. Many famous women in history were lesbians. Lesbians are teachers, doctors, lawyers, factory workers, police officers, politicians, ministers, movie stars, artists, mothers, nuns, truck drivers, models, novelists. You name it, we do it.    Lesbians are White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist. Lesbians are rich, poor, working class, and middle class. Some lesbians are in heterosexual marriages. Some lesbians are disabled. Lesbians are young women and old women. You name it, we are it.    Lesbians live in cities and in the country. We are everywhere.    How do I know if I'm a lesbian?    During adolescence, most young women begin to be aware of sexual feelings and take an interest in dating. Many young women feel physically attracted to men. But many other young women feel physically attracted to other women.    You may notice that you feel turned on by other women. You may feel different from your girlfriends, like you don't fit in sometimes. When your girlfriends are checking out boys, you may find yourself checking out girls. Going out with boys may not interest you. You may find yourself wondering, "Why aren't there any men like these terrific women I keep meeting?"    You may also feel confused or unsure about whether or not you're a lesbian. Many adults will tell us that we're too young to call ourselves gay, or that we're going through a phase, or that we don't know what we're talking about. That's their way of avoiding the fact that some of us are lesbian youth.    You may feel confused because you're attracted to both men and women. That's OK. Some women have relationships with both men and women throughout their lives. Some may later decide to be exclusively lesbian or heterosexual.    Our sexuality develops over time. Don't worry if you aren't sure.    Am I normal?    Yes, you are normal. It's perfectly natural for people to be attracted to members of their own sex. But it's not something that's encouraged in our society. Many people push away these feelings because of prejudice against gay men and lesbians.    Most scientific experts agree that a person's sexual orientation is determined at a very young age, maybe even at birth.    It's normal and healthy to be yourself, whether you're gay or straight. What's really important is that we learn to like ourselves.    What is it like to be young and lesbian?    There's no "right" way or "wrong" way to be a lesbian. Because of society's stereotypes about lesbians that we've all grown up with, you might think you have to be a certain way if you're a lesbian. But lesbians come in all shapes and sizes, from all occupations, and with all levels of education.    Your sexual orientation is only one part of who you are. You probably have hobbies and interests that are the same as your straight friends.    Because of homophobia and prejudice, some people don't accept lesbians and gay men. Lesbians and gay men suffer from discrimination and violence. That's why there are many gay and lesbian organizations that work for gay and lesbian civil rights.    Who should I tell?    Coming out is the process of accepting yourself as a lesbian and figuring out how open you want to be about your sexual orientation.    Unfortunately, not everyone you know will think that being a lesbian is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's hard to know who can handle the information and give you support. Some friends may accept you. Some may turn away from you or tell other people without your permission. Telling family can be very difficult. Some families are very supportive. But some lesbian and gay youth have been kicked out of their homes when their parents found out.    Maybe there's a guidance counselor or social worker in your school, or in a local youth or counseling agency, that you can trust. It's important to have someone to talk to because it's not normal or healthy for young people to have to keep secret such an important part of their lives.    What about sex?    Deciding whether or not to be sexual with someone is a big decision. You may feel very scared at the thought of having sex with another woman. That's OK. Lots of us do, especially if it's our first time.    Women aren't encouraged in our society to talk openly about sex, but it's important that we communicate about what we like and don't like to do sexually, whether we feel ready to have sex or not, and different expectations we may have about the relationship. And it's important to talk about whether we're at risk for HIV, the virus that is thought to cause AIDS, or other sexually transmitted diseases, like herpes.    Do I have to worry about A

I can assure you mine are still greater.   Albert Einstein  - More quotations on: [Mathematics]   Ethical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms of science. Truth is what stands the test of experience.   Albert Einstein   Every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.   Albert Einstein   Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.   Albert Einstein   Gravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love. How on earth can you explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love? Put your hand on a stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with that special girl for an hour and it seems like a minute. That's relativity.   Albert Einstein   I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.   Albert Einstein  - More quotations on: [War]   I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.

7fXpLlhBaa	People are really terrible sometimes, especially young kids who have no idea how their actions can affect others. I'm 20 years old and I have learned that you just have to learn not to care about incidents such as this. It is really hard, I know. These kinds of things happened to me a in middle school. I remember this one girl was absolutely merciless to me. But, things did get better. I even got nominated for homecoming in high school! So, it will not stay the same. People forget and move on. However, to handle this for the time being? SMILE. LAUGH. Act like it doesn't bother you. This is perhaps the best tool that you have. It will be difficult but pretending is really an art. Actually, it's called acting. In your mind, convince yourself that you are better than these losers who have nothing cooler to do except torment you. And you know you're better than them don't you? Because you are. You will get through this. Also, it might be a good idea to reach out to others such as teachers that you can trust or a parent, even an older role-model-type person who can be there to listen to you when you need them and maybe to help stop this injustice that is being rained upon you.     Smile and laugh darling, they will be scratching their heads. And getting bored with you. (Which is what you want!)    Hang in there.

In my school they would give me a 89 because 89.33 rounds down not up.|`|U8Z3gxvAaa	A teacher in that situation probably would be tempted to give the child an "A". But do not forget, teachers are rated and graded as students are. If a principal or superintendent see that all the children in that teachers class earned an "A", they may question the difficultly that his or her class provides. By the book, a teacher should round up if an grade is a .5 or higher. Anything below that remains the same grade.

When you mean that is, use i.e. It is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase id est. Either can be used to clarify a preceding statement, the first by example, the second by restating the idea more clearly or expanding upon it.

If your only options are biochemistry and microbiology then I would go with biochemistry. In terms of getting into medical school, it doesn't really matter what you major in as long as you meet the requirements and show that you have a strong background in biology, chemistry, and physics. If you want to stick with the sciences I would recommend that you major in something like biochemistry, biology, or health sciences. With biology or health sciences as a major you would get the biology (intro. bio., anatomy & physiology, genetics, intro. chem., org. chem., biochem., calculus, and physics). I don't know anything about the biochemistry major though. Good luck.|`|AA10251347	microbiology

No one wants to be around people that are stinky. Now remember just because you can't smell yourself others may. Taking a shower each day is important and more often if you are exercicing, going out somewhere, sick, or just sweat more than others and for girls that time of the month.     Using deodorant, washing all parts of your body thouroughly and with soap, scrubbing your hair, using a washcloth to clean your body. How important it is to brush and floss your teeth and use mints or gum inbetween so your breath is not stinky, getting regualr cleaning of your teeth and checkups at the dentist are all a part of this too.     Washing your hands- sing the ABC's while scrubbing will get rid of germs.

SLFt8eHEaa	The answer above is correct in that Oxford and Cambridge are the best universities (over here college is something that kids go to so we always use the term university) in the UK.  However, they only offer courses that are highly traditional and academic in focus such as history, economics, geography.  As you are looking to do slightly less traditional subjects I'd recommend you look at the UCAS website to see which universities actually offer your courses.  UCAS is the central admissions agency for university in the UK and it lists all courses offered in all UK universities.  You can find their website here:    www.ucas.ac.uk    I'd also recommend that you look at the Times newspaper's university rankings as it will be able to show you how the universities you are interested in are rated:    http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...    Also, just by way of a heads up, we don't 'major' and 'minor' at university over here.  When we apply to university we do so to study one subject (occasionally two if we take a 'joint honours' degree) and when we get there that is all we study.  Therefore you won't find any mention of 'majors' on the sites above.|`|Ajy2wXiuaa	Cambridge and Oxford buddy

9Kax4Kekaa	Well shortly after the fall of the Visigoth empire the Muslim forces rapidly took control of the Iberian peninsula (Portugal and Spain).  Muslim forces reached as far north as far as southern france but were defeated in the battle of Tours.    Considering the Muslims controlled much of Spain for so many years lead to a very large historical influence over the country.  Granada, the southern most city of Spain was under Muslim rule for over 750 years.  However other areas lasted much less time, such as the northern most cities.  By the year 1212 almost all of Spain was under catholic rule with exception of Granada which did not fall to catholic rule until 1492.    Today you can still see and hear the Arabian influence in Spain through it's architecture and many Spanish words being of Arabian origen.|`|IzxVlE6Caa	Muslim Iberia        Main article: Al-Andalus    In the 8th century, nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered (711-718) by Muslim armies (see Moors) from North Africa. These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Islamic Empire.[note 10] Only a number of areas in the north of the Iberian Peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion and they were the starters of the Reconquista. These areas roughly corresponding to modern Asturias, Cantabria, Navarre and northern Aragon.    Under Islam, Christians and Jews were recognised as "peoples of the book", and were free to practice their religion, but faced a number of mandatory discriminations and penalties as dhimmis.[9] Conversion to Islam proceeded at a steadily increasing pace. Following the mass conversions in the 10th and 11th centuries it is believed that Muslims came to outnumber Christians in the remaining Muslim controlled areas.[10] The muladies (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) comprised the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.[11]    The Muslim community in the Iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions. The Berber people of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East.[note 11] Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the Guadalquivir River valley, the coastal plain of Valencia, and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of Granada.[10]    Crdoba, the capital of the caliphate, was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city of medieval western Europe.[note 12] Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished. Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa. Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe. The Romanized cultures of the Iberian peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, thus giving the region a distinctive culture.[10] Outside the cities, where the vast majority lived, the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners, and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to a remarkable expansion of agriculture.    However, by the 11th century, Muslim holdings had fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms, allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories and consolidate their positions.[10] The arrival of the North African Muslim ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, but ultimately, after some successes in invading the north, proved unable to resist the increasing military strength of the Christian states.[7]    Fall of Muslim rule and unification        Main article: Reconquista    Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II and Isabella I.    The Reconquista ("Reconquest") is the centuries-long period of expansion of Spain's Christian kingdoms; Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of Covadonga in 722 and being concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian peninsula. The Christian army's victory over the Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northern coastal mountains. Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees, but they were defeated at the Battle of Poitiers in France. Subsequently, they retreated to more secure positions south of the Pyrenees with a frontier marked by the Ebro and Duero rivers in Spain. As early as 739 Muslim forces were driven from Galicia, which was to host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, Santiago de Compostela. A little later Frankish forces established Christian counties south of the Pyrenees; these areas were to grow into kingdoms, in the north-east and the western part of the Pyrenees. These territories included Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia.[12]    The breakup of Al-Andalus into the competing Taifa kingdoms helped the expanding Christian kingdoms. The capture of the central city of Toledo in 1085 largely completed the reconquest of the northern half of Spain.[note 13] After a Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th centuryCrdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248leaving only the Muslim enclave of Granada as a tributary state in the south.[13] Marinid invasions from north Africa in the 13th and 14th centuries failed to re-establish Muslim rule. Also in the 13th century, the kingdom of Aragon, formed by Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia expanded its reach across the Mediterranean to Sicily.[14] Around this time the universities of Palencia (1212/1263) and Salamanca (1218/1254) were established; among the earliest in Europe. The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain.[15]    In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms

If you go to a school that requires tougher classes, it makes you look like you care more about hard work, challenging yourself, and dedicating yourself to your work.  Not all students are created equal - same goes for colleges.  Some people go to college to buckle down and get straight A's and eventually land a well-paying job; others go for the social scene, or are forced to go because someone else wants them to.  Personally, I think there have to be prestigious schools, as well as "diploma mills", to appeal to everyone.  As for why Savannah State seems easier...I don't know anything about the university, but I guess it's just its culture.  Perhaps the students (as well as the administration) are more relaxed about academics.  You have to go with your intuition and decide for yourself where to go.  Which college can you imagine yourself at the most?  Forget what other people will say if you "take the easy way out" by going to Savannah State.  (Who knows, you might found out it's just a myth.)  It's all about making sure that you will be most comfortable with the college you choose.  Chances are, you'll be going to either of these schools for 4 years; if you're miserable at your school, it's going to be a loooong 4 years.    2) BBA is a Bachelor's of Business Administration.  You'll take some liberal arts classes, but the majority of your courses will be business related.  You could say it's more of a "specialized" Bachelor's.  The BA is the Bachelor ~of Arts~.  If your major is in Business Administration, you take business classes for your major, while taking a variety of courses outside business.  Here, you have to complete all the area requirements like any other Bachelor's degree at a liberal arts college.|`|VZ21gL81aa	the requirements for coursework in the liberal arts is different.  Generally:  BA requires that 75% of the coursework be in the liberal arts.  BBA requires that 25% of the coursework be in the liberal arts.    BOTH degrees require 120 credits at a minimum.|`|02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	First, a BBA is a bachelors in business admistration and BA is your typical degree bachelors degree.     I would consider looking at the types of courses being taught at each school. Compare the required courses for the majors at both schools. For the most part, the types of courses being taught and required  should be the same or similar. Read the descriptions of the courses and visit the campus of both schools. Between the course descriptions and your visit to the campus you should know which school is right for you. Trust your gut. When I was deciding on what college to go to I paid attention to my gut and ended up at a school that I loved. I tell you this because I am not one that normally pays attention to my gut. In the end, your heart should be telling you which school will be the best fit for you.     Good luck.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	I know people who have two masters, even a few with doctoral degrees and are working retail.  They are paid no more than one with just a HS diploma.  That is normal.  After a few years of retail experience you can apply for a supervisory or management position; with a degree you will have a better chance of beating out someone without one.|`|pF3VmiqUaa	When working in retail, a bachelor's degree doesn't necessarily mean that you will get paid more, especially since your degree has nothing to do with retail.  Its all about experience in the retail world.  The one exception would be Abercrombie, Hollister, and Abercrombie and Fitch.  Those stores will only hire you as a manage if you have any type of Bachelor's degree.  HTH!|`|036UU02Caa	if your working in retail you should be making what your are now. just because you have a bachelors doesn't mean you should be getting paid more in retail.|`|Xj4bTobUaa	At the moment you should just be grateful you have a job.

However if this is just a job for you and you are looking for a start in your career then it doesn't matter really does it?  I suggest that you start looking for an internship in your career field or if you like retail and the company that you're currently working for, apply for a corporate position within.  Either way Good Luck to you there's a lot of stiff competition.      BTW - there's a company called Yvest (I think it means Your Virtual employment or employer solution tool or something like that...it's a start up and I know they're always looking for interns)  your can email employerservices@yvest.com for more info.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	In the current economy, "should" doesn't apply. The employer sets the wage for the job and you decide whether or not to accept it. With a college degree, you have a better chance than someone without a degree of finding a higher level job. Such jobs pay more. In most cases, it doesn't make any difference what your degree is in. Because of the study skills, intellectual ability and college experience you gained in college in order to graduate you probably have higher level skills and judgment, which would help in any industry.

fzU2hP4yaa	The "framers", as you name them, were living under an increasingly repressive British government.  As colonists, they were seen as second-class citizens.  They were subject to arbitrary taxation, their homes and belongings could be searched and seized without pretense.  They felt they were being bullied.    "Domestic tranquility" is a fancy way of saying a peaceful life.  The concept of liberty was being able to live apart from fear of punishment without due process, the ability to speak one's mind and the choice of being able to determine what they themselves wanted from life.    How's this for a rephrasing?  "...to enable us to live peacefully, and to keep our precious freedoms safe for ourselves and our children."    Oh, and the "more perfect union" part referred to their desire to govern themselves.  Having their own country would have to be more perfect than being a British colony, or so the reasoning went.

By the end of the year, I was asking my parents for help every month to pay my rent. So even if I hated college, I'd finish it just to get a better-paying job.    On the other hand, I know a guy who hated college, dropped out, joined the Navy, and now makes more money than me and my husband combined.|`|Ajy2wXiuaa	Money won't be the answer to your problems either. Do you study and live for something you love or something you think you might like? Most importantly what do you want to do in life? did you consider that before choosing?|`|GTyq745Faa	IMG! I love college, although I do believe college isn't for everyone, I think it is first important, especially in your case sine you are already there, to think how you want to spend the rest of your life.  Yes, there are opportunities out there for people who don't go to college, and they make good money, but lets face it, a lot of jobs out there aren't going to pay well if you don't have that BA.  Yes, I know college is expensive, my tuition is 9,600 a semester!  But just know that your career is a smart investment, that may cause you a fortune now, but a less lot of stress later on.  My dad went straight into the service and never finished getting his BA.  Now, he is retired, has a family of four, a daughter who is in college, and bills to pay.  He is now thinking about going back to school, but as you can imagine it is going to be a lot more harder now, plus he has to support his family.  Would you like to one day be in that same predicament?  Why drop out if you only have a semester to go?  Also, it isn't uncommon for people to get a degree in one thing, and do something completely different.  You can still get paid well because you have that BA and I suspect having a BA in accounting is quite appealing to places looking to hire.  If you really don't like your degree maybe you can go on to your MA, and get it in something compelty different, or if you like kids and adolcesnts look into getting a teaching certificate, and teach something like math.  If you don't like these ideas, maybe you can try joining the military, they pay for your school, if money is a problem.  You can also look into other professions that will pay for your shcool.  There are a lot of different options out there, I don't think you are necessarily stuck with having to be an accountant.  I advice that you go speak to someone at the carreer center at your school.  Somethere can then tell you what different jobs you can get with your specific major.  If I were you I would first inform myself, before making a what can be a life altering decision.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, since homeschooling is so varied it would depend on the particular family.    We had a flurry here last week, and took the day off.  We watched the inauguration that morning, and then in the afternoon when the snow started falling, we were playing in it.  Of course, snow here is rare-we got a significant snow in '89 and in '02 and I can think of a couple of other flurries between those two snows.  My children were so excited, I am glad they had the chance to experience it instead of being stuck in school.  Imagine how well the children concentrated when looking out the window at the snow falling!  Mine were making snow angels on the trampoline (the only place it was sticking to).    But, like someone already pointed out-snow days are usually a result of transportation dilemmas and since that does not exist with homeschooling, there is not a necessity to take the day off.  Some would, though, because many follow the school's calendar (we set our own, personally).|`|r18PoGJiaa	You are on your own schedule.|`|dCewrtXaaa	A snow day is not a holiday. It's a transportation problem. Get over it and get going. If you can make it to your computer, start working.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	You set the schedule, so it's up to you.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Ask your mom.  Unless there's snow between your bed and wherever you do school, the answer is likely "yes" :)|`|IlndnVyBaa	Yeah, it depends on how you think of it.    I study during the summer too. Its not really like school. Its just studying whenever you get time to study. here and there.|`|e31MCWMWaa	ummmm....yeah|`|zhJOZhKEaa	Not till after you shovel the sidewalk.  :-D    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2ambQ6uX...    Actually we usually don't do school if it snows just because my kids don't get to see snow very much... they need all the time they can get to play in it.      It is strictly up to the 'powers that be'... in my house that is me.  We may cancel school for snow... and we may do school on a weekend.  |`|hLKKg86iaa	Uh yeah|`|mGEwdQyvaa	That is entirely up to your parents (or who ever is home schooling you). The state doesn't decide when you can or can't take off school when you're home schooled.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	yes, it would be a great day to plan a lesson on snowflakes or the weather or a science project on water.  Anything cool like that!|`|r1LAd0Exaa	Yeah, because your doing it on your own time.    You can choose not to do your work that day, but its still on.|`|AASxKRiAaa	Yes, unfortunately.     Here is a few things about homeschooling that are pretty funny.   ""Drawbacks to Homeschooling""  No snow days  You cant miss the bus  You cant be suspended and sent home.   You cant hid the vegetables you dont like in a milk carton.  Mom always sides with the teacher  Dad always sides with the principal  You cant intercept your report card and fix it before your parents see it  You cant transfer to another school  The nightmare of showing up in your pajamas is a daily reality  The good looking boy/ girl in the desk next to you is your brother/ sister (gross!)|`|ff2269a2bd5d7e9e24e4faa811238c43aa	ummmm...yeah.

lrqZHi9Jaa	Have a look at some of the sites below. There are some simple explanations as to how this is happening and why.    The problem with all the ice melting is that the water needs to go somewhere.  Not all evaporates into the atmosphere so it goes into the sea thereby raising sea levels.  What happens to countries and cities where millions of people live who lie lower than others...yep, they get flooded.  Natural freshwater dams get flooded with salt water, crops damaged, homes lost and people die.  For those left, where do they go?    Animals will die because their natural habitat is destroyed and they are unable to survive.  Take polar bears.  They live on ice shelves and swim from shelf to shelf in search of food.  If the ice melts they have to swim further...they can only swim so far so they end up drowning. If it happens enough they become endangered and then extinct.    It also works at the other end of the spectrum.  What about people and animals who live in constant drought conditions.  Global warming heats up hot areas even more.  Look at the difference in weather conditions worldwide.  The northern hemisphere is experiencing worst winter conditions than ever before and its gradually been getting worst and worst over the past few years.  Imagine what next year will bring.  I live in Australia.  Currently we are experiencing a heatwave in our southern states (where I am).  Hottest weather experienced for the longest time in over a century and no relief in sight.  Here in Victoria we are in the 8th year of drought.  The top half of the country is currently experiencing floods...go figure.    Hope this helps. I will also include some authors for you if you want to try to learn more and can get the books.      http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/  http://epa.gov/climatechange/kids/gw.htm...  http://www.foe.org.au/climate-justice/me...

Our ozone layer has something called "the greenhouse effect" this allows just the right amount of heat for us to live in a stable environment. However, things like carbon monoxide and pollution are depleting our ozone layer, allowing more heat in. This is a problem because:  When ice caps melt they put more freshwater in our oceans, this kills fish and other animals that have to live in a certain salt water environment.  Animals that live in cold places are running out of fish to eat and ice to live in. It also cause extreme weather such as hurricanes because of the way the water currents and stuff work.  All of this is sort of a domino effect... when something upsets the way the environment works, it affects everyone.    Hope this helped!

JUmfm168aa	Hello,    The first sequence is a sequence of cubes.    The numbers are 0^3 = 0, 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27.    Thus, the fifth term will be 4^3 = 64.    The second sequence has a common difference (added amount) of (d-1) per term.    The fourth term will thus be (5d-3) + (d-1) = 6d-4.

IlndnVyBaa	Homeschooling.    I started homeschooling in 9th grade and now since I study myself I am probably smarter than other kids my age. Homeschooling is more efficient because you can learn at your own pace and you don't have pressures like homework and tests. But I do study things at my own pace and I understand better than regular schooling.    The people saying they lack social skills are wrong. I have had 10 years of social skill before and also I still go to stores and stuff. School isn't the only socialization.    The only disadvantage is that I don' t have any friends anymore|`|S4QBvAaGaa	While I am a big homeschool advocate, I say let the child try both before deciding and the one that comes first is completely up to the bias of the parent or child. There are too many factors to consider on a case by case basis for me to recommend that one would be preferable to the other. I wasted my time in public school before homeschooling while some kids are trapped at home schooling and their first experience in public school is like a warm breeze.  Good Luck! :)|`|LsAArkUyaa	There are several factors to consider. It all depends on the student, the parents, the local schools, the type of home school program, the amount of home school support in the area etc|`|bCi8BCBBaa	Without knowing anything about you or your family, I can't recommend either.  You've gotten some recommendations for both that are recommending what is working for the person answering.  Google "home school advantages" you'll come up with tons of hits.  You have to figure out which is better for you.    There are a lot of advantages to home schooling.  You can move at your own pace, you can study more in depth, you have more time for non-school activities..and so on.  But not every family can do it or should do it.  Some families have obligations to take care of ill or elderly family members. In others both parents need to work.  Some kids, even in high school, aren't cut out to study on their own.  In this economy, it would be convenient to say it is just a matter of choice for both parents to work, but with underemployment, it isn't our place to judge.  And some people prefer learning in a school environment, while others prefer homeschooling.  It is pretty self-centered to think that what's best for you is best for everyone else.     Start doing some research, ask people who have done both what they think were the advantages of both for them.  You can come to a decision about whats best for you that way.|`|XSTjyO1naa	It depends. Home schooling is good if your parents can manage your studies and routine. All the public high schools are not bad. You might have bad experience of your school. If you don't want to be home schooled, look for another school after careful analysis.  You can search on the Schools across US, on this directory:|`|ff2269a2bd5d7e9e24e4faa811238c43aa	Of the two options you mentioned I would favor staying in public school.

But If I was told that I am to start homeschooling this year, I would miss all the interactions with the annoying and nice people. I don't think I would get full interaction with all sorts of people. Those homeschool people say their social skills are adequate but I'm sure most people are really nice and you don't really come across people that are annoying.    btw, a particular number of homeschool people that say that normal schooled people stick to stereotypes and are afraid to stick up for themselves- High School Musical is actually fictional and every person is an individual in high school except for the odd number of doormats|`|TxVlzvnSaa	Homeschooling, by far.  As a high school student, I strongly recommend homeschooling.  I could try to convince you that homeschooling is the right choice, but it would take all day.    Instead, I suggest you check out Grace Llewellyn's 'The Teenage Liberation Handbook-how to quit school and get a real education and life'.   Oh, what a beautiful book it is! "This is a very dangerous book. It contradicts all the conventional wisdom about dropouts and the importance of a formal education. It is funny and inspiring. Do not, under any circumstances, share this book with a bright, frustrated high-schooler being ground into mind fudge by the school system. This writer cannot be responsible for the happiness and sense of personal responsibility that might [result]." -Bloomsbury Review    Read it, enjoy it, and remember that there are many ways to homeschool.  Unschooling is only one of them, but it may just give you the extra kick you need to get out of high school and into a REAL education!    Enjoyyyy!
SIhxrxD3aa	While zoology or marine biology might be fun to take genetics is your best bet.  You'll have to take genetics as a pre-requisite for vet school and this would give you a head's up on the college level course.  Not all schools offer that as a specific classes instead it's only taught as a section of a biology course so you'll probably get more in depth than the average high school student.

Put the right angle in a corner to make it easier to visualise.    You may know from theory that a triangle with two angles equal is isosceles.    You may or may not also know that in an isosceles triangle, the two sides with the same angle are the same length.    From Pythagoras' Theorem, since a^2 + b^2 = c^2, you have the lengths of all sides for an arbitrary value.    If you are struggling with this, then say for example one of the equal sides has length a units, where a can have any real value. Then, it's opposite side has also length a units.    This gives by Pythagoras that the hypotenuse is sqrt(a^2 + a^2) = sqrt(2a^2) = a*sqrt(2).    Then, decide which angle you will use ratios from. Since it is a right-angled triangle, and the other angles are equal, this must be 45.    The final thing that you need to know is trigonometry:  Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse.  Cosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse.  Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent.    Note that when you divide side lengths, the arbitrary value a will cancel, as it is a factor of every side, so the ratios will be numbers.    [You should get that sine (45) = 1/sqrt(2), cosine (45) = 1/sqrt(2), and that tangent = 1.]|`|s2z7PCAeaa	since two angles are congruent (two 45 degrees) the triangle is isosceles so the sides having them are congruent and have same length. The base would be 2 times one of the congruent sides    example- you have triangle with 45 45 90 angles.    let the two sides having 45 degrees below (when touching the base) be 5    so third side and the base would be 5 times 2 which is 52|`|pzDTE2G1aa	_  1:1: 2  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:45-45-...

This quote means that lack of knowledge in a situation will hinder a person from taking the risk in finding out the true; therefore the person fears the future without actually being aware. Some crap like that i wrote..    But anyway, you can't go wrong, it's a "critical" essay based on opinion. It's only wrong if you did not defend your explanation with back up information for example: connecting the books to the quote and your explanation through the use of literary elements/techniques/devices. Teachers usually grade regents pretty lenient so don't worry so much about it.

F3fNi1Coaa	Brett and Maria are correct but if you need an explanation as to how they arrived at this:    The possible combinations are HH,TT,H(coin1)T(coin2), and T(coin1)H(coin2), ie 4 combinations. Therefore TT is one/four ie a quarter or 25per cent. Therfore to not get two tails is 100 - 25 per cent = 75 per cent.    Another way of expressing this is the chance of getting a Tail with the first coin is 50 percent, likewise the chance of getting a Tail with the Second Coin is also 50per cent. 50% x 50% = 25%. 100 - 25% = 75%.  ( to get "three" tails in three tosses would be 50% x 50% x 50% = 12.5% and to not get three consecutive tails would be 100% - 12.5% = 87.5%)    Think about it logically, if you threw a million coins in the air although you would expect 50% of them to fall as heads and 50% as tails would you expect all one million coins to land down Tails (with not a single head 50% of the time and all one million of the coins to land down Heads (with no Tails) 50% of the time. I don't think so!!! Other respondents are not answering your question but rather "if you tossed two coins in the air, what are the chances that the second one would come down tails - which always should be 50%.    I have provided you with this information as you are getting contradictary advice. If you don't know the answer you would not know which one to pick!    Thanks ron John  I think you've expressed this better than me. I also apologise to you I marked you down rather than up, I hit the wrong button and couldn't correct it!! You certainly have my sentiments though.    If there are any doubters though this could be resolved by playing a game. Get a friend to toss a coin at the same time that you do. If it comes down 2 Tails he gives you $10, if it comes down any other combination you give him $5. I can assure you that it will not be long before you have lost all your money.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	pretty good|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	The chance of any given coin is 1 in 2 or 50/50  no matter how many coins you add to the toss, the odds wont change regardless of the order you want  Two coins 2 tn 4  three coins 3 in 6  if you want the odds that 6 coins tossed and landing 3 heads 3, tails, it's 50/50|`|jpqSnCpuaa	the chance that you will get two tails is 25% so that means that you are left with 75% that it won't be two tails.|`|eca4c567b412164e4b3f2d62944e6871aa	Other answers are right  50%  even if they turn up heads in 99 out 100 your odds are still 50%|`|Rm9mII46aa	I don't think this was meant to be a riddle, people. I'm a bit shocked at how many people said things other than 75%. The answer is 75%, definitely.     I think J.J. said it pretty well. There are four possible outcomes.   HH  HT  TH  TT    Because "HT" and "TH" are theoretically the same thing does NOT mean that they don't still count as individual mathematical possibilities.  They aren't assigned number values, they are concrete probabilities (the person that answered 66% was thinking of number probability, wherein two of the same kind negate a second possibility).     Here's a good rule of thumb for coin-toss math (that many people seem to have forgotten since grade school):    Each outcome represents a single, concrete possibility. Let's say, for an experiment, that each outcome is labeled on a tennis ball and thrown into a bag. If you reach your hand in to pull out a tennis ball, what are the chances of the tennis ball saying "TT" on it? One in four, because there are FOUR tennis balls in the bag and you can only pick ONE. So, the three tennis balls left represent 75% of all the tennis balls.     Was this third grade? Fourth, maybe? Whatever.  75%|`|xrZaufkEaa	75%|`|sRU25t7Laa	50%|`|8a6bf2187ad4cdeb84d9ab991310963eaa	66%   1/3 chance flipping 2 heads  "                           1 head 1 tail  "                           2 tails  1/3 and 1/3 comes out 2 66%

2b8GeAX5aa	Yes, it is a form of punishment.  A kid is detained @ school and has to sit quietly and do homework/assignments.  It also gives them a time to reflect on what they did wrong and how to correct the behavior so they will not repeat the same behavior again.  Most kids hate this kind of punishment because they are in a hurry to get home after a long day @ school, so they can do their normal after school activities (sports, play on computer, be with friends, etc.)  Plus when they get a detention @ school, they usually have punishment to deal with @ home as well (grounding)   Hope this helps!!!|`|AzeOk29saa	I think it's to reflect on what you did wrong.  That, or just plain punishment.|`|f8KtHeAvaa	Its punishment.|`|AA10529994	it's punishment, it makes you miss whatever after school thing your involved with (sports, etc).

qeUoAW6naa	Different schools have different ideas for what to keep the student occupied with during detention. Even I fully agree that indeed the student should be given something constructive to do, even if it means doing a bit of gardening on the school lawn or something. Then at least he/she is being productive in some or other way, instead of just wasting time (which will cause that person's skills to degenerate anyway!). I'd say punishments are also ok.... you know, the types that are not too severe, like writing out stuff, like the dictionary lolz. All in all, it should teach students not to take life's resources (such as time, educational privileges etc.) for granted.|`|81ZqCu42aa	It is a punishment for children that misbehaved. It teaches them not to make the same mistake again, but I think it is stupid because it has no effect on children.|`|ISljRZIRaa	punishment?|`|SA5DeRpUaa	it's a joke.  my parents pay taxes so the teachers have jobs.  than they think they can yell at you and give you detention  they have to realize most of the kids don't event want to be there and they should be lucky they even showed up.  and yes the kids just sit there being "punished"  when in reality the teacher's entire career depends on these kids who  should be respected not punished.|`|bQ6LNgGbaa	At my school we have RCR's, which stands for responsible choices room. It sounds like it would be a reward, not a punishment but it is actually detention. In an RCR, we have to write a 500 word essay on what we did wrong and what we are going to do next time in that situation. When we are finished writing we have to sit quietly doing nothing. They also call your parents.  A detention is to punish you for doing something wrong, by making you be bored for an hour and half, bfefore school.   Detentions sometimes will also exclude you from certain school trips, like if you've had more than 6 detentions throughout the school year, you can't go to Washington DC (US capital).|`|fPavekfeaa	Detention is meant to serve as a punishment hence the reason more often than not kids are made to just sit there. Its boring, its not incredibly constructive, but that's what punishments are supposed to be.    Some schools do allow students to do their homework while in detention, others take the approach that since this is a punishment you should not be allowed to do anything beneficial to you during the detention. I personally think this is counter productive and could go on at length on my opinion of the subject but that would deviate from the question that has been asked.|`|yywRjouyaa	Generally speaking it is a way to exclude you from your peer/s friends. (In school suspension)  Usually the students are given work that they must complete and when that is finished they are supposed to find something to study or work on.   The problem that most educators don't see is some kids actually like detention.   I liked being able to work at my own pace and not listen to the teacher. I was a very independent student so I was able to complete work in the fraction of the time and basically blow off the rest of the day.  Some things I did with my free time was pierce my ears with a safety pin, write songs or read a far more interesting murder mystery book.   I actually loved detention.|`|MyV9qm99aa	Punishment. At my school when i was a little younger, if you were punished then you had to go before school and write a 500 essay on why ypu got punished in 30 mins. If you dont't you get another one.

EmZytbxyaa	The mockingbird, an innocuous being, causing harm to no one, often is preyed on or killed. Throughout the novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee used several individuals to symbolize the innocence of the mockingbird. Mr. Dolphus Raymond was among one of these persons. The community of citizens living in Maycomb criticized and persecuted Dolphus Raymonds ways. Living with a black mistress and having mixed children, was regarded immoral, especially during the times when racism and prejudice were still high.     Primarily, Scout formed an opinion about Mr. Dolphus as well, that he was an evil, corrupted man. Mr. Dolphus Raymond exposing his darkest secret to the two children was a significant part in the novel. It marked the beginning of Scouts growing maturity. This passage was a turning point in the novel, Scouts innocence was shattered, and she began to gain a more in-depth understanding of the society around her.    The society we live in is judgmental and condemnatory. Mr. Dolphus Raymond convinced his fellow citizens to assume that he was a drunk. I try to give em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. When I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this sack, folks can say Dolphus Raymonds in the clutches of whiskey thats why he lives the way he does. (Lee 200) Dolphus Raymond was quite amused by the societys stereotypes and didnt allow it to affect his life humanly. He portrayed the acts of society by quoting: Cry about the simple hell people give other people without thinking (Lee 201) In the quote Raymond depicted his views about how the society ran. In this way Dolphus Raymond was another victim of injustice as well as a mockingbird.       Jem and Scouts perception of the world is traumatized after Tom Robinson is convicted.  The outcome compels Scout and Jem to confront the fact that the principles Atticus has taught them can not always be acquiescent with the certainty of the world and the wickedness of human nature.   The harsh reality of the court system truly affects them when they watch Judge Taylor polling the jury. Jem and Scout find out that there is racism and injustice present in the minds of the people surrounding them and in turn are incredulous as to how people can be horrid to other human beings. Jem depicts this realization when it is his turn to cry. (Lee 212)    In this passage, the two children realize the ethical temperament of human beings and establish the difference between a person that is fundamentally moral or malevolent.   The story draws near to this question by producing Scout and Jem's alteration from a perception of childhood purity, in which they presume that people are good because they have never perceived evil, to a more adult perception, in which they have tackled evil and must include it into their comprehension of the world.    This was one of my essays I did for the book. You can use it to help it in any other problems you encounter w/the book.     1. They were fascinated by it, because of all the crazy rumors that were spread about Boo Radley.   2. sorry can't seem to remember, it was in the beg. of the book  3. Dill did not have a stable family, with no mother. And, Scout lacked a mother.   4. She was ahead of her class, and was able to read quite well. Although, she was chided by her teacher due to her advancement.  5. Since, it is from Scout's point of view, some events are limited. The language and thought, is mature, however not completely.     Sorry, I'm a little rusty, I did this for school in the summer.     Please answer mine: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|BPN8zY2yaa	Wow, I haven't read that book in years, but I'll see what I can remember...    1.

I cannot remember exactly, but I seem to think that Dill's parents are divorced, and Scout's mother is dead.  4. Scout is proven to be smart because in school, she gets into trouble because she can already read and write.  5. I have no idea (too much thinking for this hour, sorry)    Hope this helps!|`|DHJkOpMgaa	1)Because Boo Radley never came out of the house 2)They didnt??? 3)Scouts: they were all close/happy ect...Dill: He had a differnt fathers dill wasnt happy w/ his family...scout was....they both didnt have mothers 4) She was nice and stuff I dunno you need somthing from the book I dont know what chapter or w/e your on 5)I dont get this question but like because scout was opend minded mayybe...mayybe because they were in the south Hope I helped?? 
Hj7fcbjzaa	She probably sees you as a student who takes your work seriously.    It sounds to me like she might just be genuinely concerned about you.  A good teacher would respond in some way to a student who was having a panic attack.    Unless she's said anything inappropriate, invited you over to her house, touched you in a way that made you feel uncomfortable or something, there probably isn't any need to be alarmed.

But you're pretty confident of your looks. Yknow, since your name at that link is blahblahblahishot and your caption "This is me smiling, lookin cute in all =)")    Why ask for strangers' opinions if you already think you're real hot? Strangers that are probably years older than you? I wonder if your parents know you're posting your pictures and pictures of your family on that site and even here for the world to see..|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I think that in 20 years you will (better start practcing now)  be saying "Welcome to WalMart"  and most certainly you   will be NOT MEMORABLE, fo sure|`|X40Ww89qaa	dood don't put your whole family album up there...|`|iXWXllhQaa	So you're going into middle school?    I'd say you shouldn't worry about that now. You're far too young.    But you are a pretty young lady.    Don't make boys your first priority.|`|gZn622dEaa	aww your really pretty! =) you'll make a great cheerleader!But it's best not to worry about it now.|`|zn6OVTJHaa	Um, I don't think it's looks that you need to worry about. I'd be more concerned about your attitude. Comments like this (taken from your website): "I am so far the smartest and coolest kid in my class.Everybody looks up to me" exude arrogance. Tone it down a little. Nobody likes a stuck-up princess.

But style your hair differently, I think a bold fringe will work for you, don't be afraid of curls, too. And hey, good for you, above the influence, eh?

Do your parents know that you post pictures and stuff? You don't need to worry about being a pretty cheerleader and getting asked out and stuff, but to answer your question, yes, you are pretty, but still cute. You look pretty young .|`|iHYf76jHaa	I'm a bit older than you but your definitely above average.  And your so young.

I actually forget we're in a depression. Nothing seems bad to me. My rates are the same, gas prices couldn't be better since they are cheaper now. And my grocery bill didn't even go up. I always used coupons and shopped responsibly and lived that way. Nothing has changed for me, I don't know what people are talking about. I even have two part time jobs with great pay that I got when everyone told me I'd have a terrible time finding even one.

However, the truth hurts. Sometimes there is truth in the things people say. Other times, people are just insecure.

t8C07ZsBaa	at the moment I'm taking physics, chemistry and anatomy and physiology among other AP courses and honors classes. the work is tough but I still have a social life, I still have time for other things. I think it's a great idea, don't back out. it won't be a workload, I'm a junior and this is the way things are for me. trust me. history is a bit more favored, as long as its honors. i definitely encourage you to take ap euro, ap us history because its favored by colleges.|`|6Gfz125Paa	I took 5 AP classes my junior year.  I don't think it's impossible. A lot depends on the teachers and on how much time you're willing to put in.|`|bH1ttumcaa	keep the 2 ap's, and have at least 3 honors. That way you can get an honors grant which will pay for your college, or 3/4 of it. Gym credits are required so try to get at least 2 gym credits. study classes aren't really necessary unless you need help improving your skills. Foreign Languages look really good on an application along with sciences. You have to have 2 years of languages, and 3 of the rest on honors. If you complete all those that will be acceptable for the academic grant through fafsa, which like I said will pay up to 4 grand of your college tuition.

Paragraph 4 Sentence 8: Once all of the piano pieces are made and painted, they are put together.  2.m. Paragraph 5 Sentence 2: Then you slide the action in, lower in an iron casting, and bolt the [?] into the case.  [Is that an iron CASING or CASTING?  What gets bolted--the action or the iron?]  2.n.

FEVQisMGaa	All my academics were honors.    First AP was sophomore year--Euro Hist.    By my junior year, I had 7 honors/AP.    Six AP in senior.    Depends on what you're trying to achieve.    You need a lot to be competitive for college. Depends on the teachers, depends on the culture of your school, depends on how much time/effort your willing to put in.    The AP tests are important too. Do you intend to take them, or do you just want the GPA bump.    EDIT:    The key to taking multiple AP classes is to see how they relate to one another.    If your school is very liberal with their scheduling, you're gonna want to group them similarly.    Economics and Government are good together.    There's also macro & micro econ. And AP gov has two sets as well.    They go great w/ AP US history.    Euro history is good with world history.    And keep in mind all this knowledge is cumulative. What you learn from the previous classes helps with the others.    Calculus and statistics go well together.    The languages are easy as hell if you're already fluent in it. They're basically elementary level exams--even the AP foreign language lit.    I  can tell you it was stressful as hell, but I had a crazy good support structure. The teachers were friendly and my friends were the best.    To this day I still hang out w/ some of my teachers. Hell some of them are like drinking buddies.|`|MyV9qm99aa	When I was in school I had 3 as well. I easily dealt with it because it helped in my career-interpreter(translator). Go for it.

I SAY DO IT. if u can.
8vKrxSYyaa	Nearly all postgraduate Masters programmes are self funded unless you win a University scholarship, which pays your tuition and gives you a stipend salary.  In stating that, scholarships for Masters courses are rare and are usually given to those undertaking a PhD.<br>  <br>  Universities in Scotland usually have a hardship fund for students that have difficulties in funding their courses.  To my knowledge, SAAS does not pay for postgraduate courses.<br>  <br>  You could try looking at the SAAS website, but I am sure Labour stopped it.

On a real IQ test, only about 2 people in 1000 would score above 130.

(But add some more, and a conclusion is important, like the last sentence i put.)    I bought a laptop, which I had bought for the first time myself. To buy the laptop I worked for three months. Once I had enough money I bought the laptop and spent a lot of time using it. It represents me because it holds all of my homework, the games I play, work from photoshop, etc. These are some of my interests, but I am intersected in other things such as music. Lately I have been interested in writing my own music and I use a program called Logic to do this. Its a lot of fun for me to learn new things and my laptop helps me do this. I am really good at learning how to do things on this computer which is why I take my laptop everywhere and why it represents me.

With this, I time myself on how long I've been doing homework and give myself points for homework finished in 1-10 minutes (mostly Fridays) and homework that lasts for thirty minutes or longer. I also give myself a point for every half hour of studying, and every did-homework-on-Friday weekend. If I get seven points in a week, I reward myself. I have seven points so far this week, horray!

t2SGVG1Vaa	Well a lot of times, effort is a big part of your grade, like 'participation' could be 10 or 15% maybe (raising your hand in class and things of that nature) so even with low test scores, you might be able to pass. If you do end up with an overall failing grade though, they can't pass you because you don't understand the material, and you will have to either drop the class (if it's not required) or take it over. :[    I hope you end up passing! Good luck :D|`|KfxTNNP5aa	If you fail then they should not pass you by any means. That would mean that you received a grade that you did not earn and what about all the kids who worked and actually earned a passing grade: are they just looked over because they did well?|`|RYVKYYnAaa	Depending on your math teacher they might pass you anyways. Most teachers will pass you if you make a general effort, especially one that they can see. And if what you say is true then it looks like you have been making an effort.

KikXHTeUaa	I would ask if he could be placed in another class, this teacher obviously gives way to much homework.|`|26991c1ba20b717681957ed25b316eacaa	That is way too much homework for a 4th grader. I wouldn't discourage your son or pile more on his plate will make him more and more frustrated.  Every parent has an idea of "trying hard" but you should probably arrange a meeting with your child's teacher. Maybe ask to see a set of state curriculum requirements for the grade. Maybe try to get a tutor if nothing else helps, he may also have a learning disability that you are unaware of.|`|WdmmUGfcaa	Set up a conference with the teacher and explain the situation again.  Tell her he is trying and is having 2 hours of homework a night. ( The standard is supposed to be 40 minutes for 4th grade).  You are doing all you can and you feel he needs some positive reinforcement for the work he is doing.  Perhaps a contract of some kind can be set up so he sees his work is paying off.  If the teacher is unwilling to work with you the next step is speaking with the principal.
tHucqyhcaa	It all depends on the state and the individual case. It first depends on the age of the minor, such as the sentence would more than likely be harsher if he molested an 8 year old student as opposed to touching a 16 year old student.   I would hope that he would be barred from teaching ever again, but like I said, it depends on the individual case. He will probably have to register as a sex offender like every two years or something, but they might allow him to teach in other states. He will have a record if the case makes it to trial. It depends on if there was only one victim or if there were others, as well. The sentence he receives would be higher depending on the competency of the victim (such as if it were a handicapped child or not).  He won't be allowed to apply for a job for at least 18 months after trial, I'd assume.   It all depends on the school if they want to press charges or not. Again, it depends on the state if that is even legal or not.  I would HOPE the victim presses charges (or their parents depending on the victims age) because every 2 and a half minutes somebody in the United States gets sexually assaulted and not even half of the victims report it.   Hope I helped.
avhgLEu8aa	Your daughter should have done as she was asked. It isn't a choice, people have to do what teachers ask of them or they will be sent to the principle.  There's nothing you or anyone should do about the supply teacher, ask your daughter to just do what is asked of her and things like this won't happen again.    Also, who says the teacher has anger problems?  Just because he might be strict and take no crap doesn't mean he has anger problems.  And I refuse to believe that your son has never done anything to deserve being sent to the principles office either. Think about it, I remember when our class had supply teachers and even the usually best behaved students would act up.|`|AA10405438	Have a talk with your daughter and tell her disrespect will not be tolerated.

In the incident both parties were wrong.The teacher for belittling your daughter and your daughter going ot gym and refusing to take part in the class as she was suppose to and being rude.TIP: Her attitude and rrudeness could have set the teacher off more.    ALso another tip: you stated you heard this teacher has anger issues.Did you hear this from adults or kids.Also do you know exactly what your son be doing when he has a sub in class.Sometimes kids act out in school but then will be perfect angels around parents.Do your son be following directions when he has a sub and doing what he is told?|`|OeStJR2Maa	The teacher may have been rude, but you're daughter was wrong, she was in gym class, not math so should have  been playing ball.

However, your daughter was 100% wrong. She has no excuse to study for math in gym whatsoever, and she disrespected the teacher after she/hr said she had to play.|`|5oJYzjotaa	I wouldn't punish her. I think it's foolish to teach our kids to blindly accept whatever someone in a position of power says.  It doesn't sound like she was being disrespectful, just voicing her valid opinion.  I'd be proud of my daughter for wanting to study for her math test as opposed to tossing a ball around.  If anything I would just have a talk with her.  As for the supply teacher if the principal already said they would talk to him about it then I would leave it for now unless there's another incident.  It sounds like you're doing a great job raising her.|`|b0gVjs5Jaa	Did you try hitting her?|`|bxIVY9Ukaa	I personally think that this supply teacher was VERY rude and that is no way for a person to treat another person. You should not punish your daughter for standing up for herself to a jerk! If the school principle does not do anything about it then you should contact the school and complain about this certain teacher.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, and 3+ years of residency.  You don't need a nursing degree to be a doctor, just major in whatever you want and take the premed courses in bio, chem, physics and math while in college.  You can then apply to med school anywhere that has one, and pretty much every college and university offers premed.  If you start at community college, keep in mind that med schools usually recommend you take your premed classes at the university you graduate from (highest level school), not community college.  And you do need a 4-year college degree to apply, not just 2-year.|`|LvnEbqxAaa	To become a doctor, the first step is getting a bachelor's degree at a college. There isn't necessarily a required degree, but there are courses you are required to take in order to get into medical school including general biology, general chemistry, physics, organic chemistry, and calculus. You can get these requirements in most colleges, but not all colleges have nursing programs. After graduating from college, you need to go to medical school for another 4 years, where you get training as a doctor and choose a specialty (cardiology, pediatrics, neurology, etc.) After medical school you need to work as an intern I believe for 2 years.

Sozc3MyFaa	There is no such thing as a pre-PA program, just as there is not a pre-med major--its just a list of the classes you need to apply to the schools.  So any college/university that offers a pre-med curricula (science) will work for PA school.  I would contact the aapa.org for a list of PA programs in your area & requirements.  It is extremely competitive--there are at least 3-4 applicants for every position (or more).  You need to get healthcare experience, excellent grades, and take all the medical-science related classes you can.  Most people apply to more than one program.

KaAXJJo8aa	Well first, since you are in a university, you need to start writing like you actually attend one. I found this extremely hard to read but i got the gist of it. This site can help you out.   http://dictionary.reference.com/ (not being rude.. i have it as my home page)    A large amount of kids in college have changed their majors so you are not the only one that is confused about what you should do in life. I have personally changed my major three times and I am only in my first year. Pick something you enjoy. Whether its math or science, let it be something that you'll enjoy doing for most of your adult life. You can do a lot more things with a math degree. I've heard accounting is very prosperous or you can also be a researcher. Do whatever you put your mind to.    Hope this helped :)

RgGYsNLJaa	To the person above me- teaching is an extremely respectable career, and if you've had any success in your own life, it's mainly due to your teachers. I'm sorry that you're too ignorant to see that.    But anyway, I also plan on being a kindergarten teacher. I'm a senior in HS now as well, and there are a few classes availible- like child development, educational methods, exploratory teaching(internships)-so just ask a counselor if you have any courses related to teaching.    As for college, you'll need to get a degree in general education first, and then declare your major as early childhood education or elementary education(both cover kindergarten in most areas-I'm not sure about Australia though). When you get there, work with a counselor and they'll help you plan exactly what courses you'll need.|`|b0gVjs5Jaa	Not until you have failed at everything else can you qualify to be a teacher.

ilz08Y3taa	This sentence is not a double negative.  The word "incorrect" is an adjective.  In order for it to be a double negative there must be a negative adverb (no, not) and a pronoun present (none, nobody, nothing, etc.).      Just think of the sentence as "Although the information you gave was not (erroneous, false, etc.) you could have gone into more detail."    So the adjective here does not determine whether or not it is a double negative.|`|MI2U5sWyaa	no + &-|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Yes it is a double negative.|`|zn6OVTJHaa	Yes, it is a double negative as written.

AXiKJDV9aa	Well Harvard and similar schools are a reach for anyone, and IMHO not necessarily the best choice.  Great schools of course, and they do provide excellent financial aid (those stories you hear about only the rich can go is rubbish - if you earn under 60K you generally pay nothing at such schools); but IMHO these days other schools would be a smarter choice.<br>  <br>  Why is that?  Well first understand every Tom, Dick and Harry has a bachelors these days - its like HS was 20 years ago.  The action these days is in graduate school.  You should look on undergrad as preparation for graduate school, just like you look on HS as a preparation for college.  IMHO the college you choose should be one that sends a lot of students to graduate school.  The two best I know of are Harvey Mudd and New College Florida (they send about 2/3's off to graduate school):<br>  <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmc.edu/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ncf.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncf.edu/</a><br>  <br>  For undergrad they would be my two top choices, above even schools like Harvard, MIT and Caltech.<br>  <br>  What you should be doing now is picking about 10 colleges that interest you, and starting a dialogue with them about what you need to do to get in.  To start you out on picking those 10 schools check out:<br>  <a href="http://www.ctcl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctcl.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/education/edlife/gems.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&sq=20%20Hidden%20Gems&st=nyt&scp=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/educat...</a><br>  <br>  Once you have 10 schools you like go to their web sites and learn all you can about them, especially their admission requirements. Formulate a plan to meet those requirements.  Then, last but not least, drop the schools a line to ensure you are on the tight track.  Don't be shy.  Colleges love to hear from prospective students.  Review the list sophomore and junior year, then apply senior year knowing, due to your preparation, you have the inside running.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill

5cS5OauSaa	If you're up to it I really recommend AP Physics because it would give you a head start on your college credits. However it might be more challenging than what you are after.  If that's the case, I recommend you take normal physics because many of the high schools I'm aware of require it anyways. Taking physics will put you on a level playing field once you get into college and it can also help with calculus when you start that class.|`|yB5go5wbaa	If you did well in all your other science classes, I'd try AP Physics, just because AP classes look better to colleges - Physics is a ton of math though, so if you're good at that, I'd go for it.

BcDXC47haa	The Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) is a member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses. It is the smallest rhinoceros, standing about 120145 centimetres (3.94.8 ft) high at the shoulder, with a body length of 250 centimetres (98 in) and weight of 500800 kilograms (11001760 lb). Like the African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically 1525 centimetres (610 in), while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran Rhino's body.    Members of the species once ranged throughout rainforests, swamps and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China, where they survived into historical times in the southwest, particularly in Sichuan.[5][6] They are now critically endangered, with only six substantial populations in the wild: four on Sumatra, one on Borneo, and one on peninsular Malaysia. Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number around 300. The decline in the number of Sumatran Rhinoceros is attributed primarily to poaching for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kilogram on the black market.[7] The rhinos have also suffered from habitat loss as their forests have been cleared for lumber and conversion to agriculture.    The Sumatran Rhino is a mostly solitary animal except for courtship and child-rearing. It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan Rhinoceros, in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran Rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. The program was considered a disaster even by its initiators, with most of the rhinos dying and no offspring being produced for nearly 20 years, an even worse decline than in the wild.    The first documented Sumatran Rhinoceros was shot 16 kilometres (10 miles) outside Fort Marlborough, near the west coast of Sumatra, in 1793. Drawings of the animal, and a written description, were sent to the naturalist Joseph Banks, then president of the Royal Society of London, who published a paper on the specimen that year. It was not until 1814, however, that the species was given a scientific name, by Johann Fischer von Waldheim, a German scientist and curator of the State Darwin Museum in Moscow, Russia.[8][9]    The scientific name Dicerorhinus sumatrensis comes from the Greek terms di (, meaning "two"), cero (??, meaning "horn"), and rhinos (?, meaning "nose").[10] Sumatrensis is derived from Sumatra, the island in Indonesia on which the rhinos were first discovered.[11] Carolus Linnaeus originally classified all rhinos in the genus Rhinoceros; therefore the species was originally identified as Rhinoceros sumatrensis. Joshua Brookes considered the Sumatran Rhinoceros, with its two horns, a distinct genus from the one-horned Rhinoceros, and gave it the name Didermocerus in 1828. Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger proposed the name Dicerorhinus in 1841. In 1868, John Edward Gray proposed the name Ceratorhinus. Normally the oldest name would be used, but a 1977 ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature established the proper genus name as Dicerorhinus.|`|dnld9tqhaa	The scientific name Dicerorhinus sumatrensis comes from the Greek terms di (, meaning "two"), cero (??, meaning "horn"), and rhinos (?, meaning "nose").[10] Sumatrensis is derived from Sumatra, the island in Indonesia on which the rhinos were first discovered.[11] Carolus Linnaeus originally classified all rhinos in the genus Rhinoceros; therefore the species was originally identified as Rhinoceros sumatrensis.

QduQ77tqaa	Spanish is pretty much being shoved down our throats more and more. You hear it when you call your favorite clothing company, your doctor, the bank.... I've noticed you now have to "press 1 for English" and stay on the line for spanish... what is that about?    My nephew is autistic and also in preschool and they're teaching him spanish in the classrooms. My niece in 4th grade is getting full on lessons each week at her school... its all over the place and extremely unnecessary.   I would definitely call the school and complain. If this is a regular part of the day [or week] request that your son be put in a different room when this happens. You have legitimate reasons and you're 100% right here. Its too much information for any child and honestly, its very nervy to assume that every parent will be ok with this.  P.S. we're not talking about college or high school. He's a child. And if he's already learning another language which his parent[s] decides will benefit him more, then that's their choice. What the school should've done was informed all parents and sent home some kind of permission slip.|`|gyzMxjAiaa	It is unlikely that the teacher is speaking only Spanish unless it is a Spanish Immersion program. If that is true you should have been told. They may be teaching Spanish as part of the curriculum, or it may be a bilingual classroom. In general, kids learn another language best when they start young. However, your child's speech delay should be considered. Talk to his speech therapist about the situation, and in the meantime ask the teacher what is happening in the classroom.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	I understand that it's politically correct to teach our children a second language at a young age but I don't always agree with this.  We are a society that is predominately ignorant when it comes to proper grammar, punctuation and spelling.  I don't understand why we feel we have to teach a second language when we aren't fluent in the first?  Why be a society that is ignorant in 2 languages?|`|R2nIUtH0aa	there's not much you can do tech him spanish then buy a rosetta stone pack or something or get a neighbor who speaks both spanish and english|`|ecE5m2T2aa	As a preschool teacher myself, I know that young children absorb everything that's around them.  They are always interested in learning new things and catch on fast. Are you certain that the teacher is only speaking spanish in the class?

As long as your son is not forgetting english, you have nothing to worry about.|`|AbQCkNHuaa	Let him learn spanish, but also talk in spanish at the home and have him answer in english.

It's not rude at all, why don't you help him teach some Tagalog to his friends at school?  Kids love learning about different things and it helps them get a better understanding of the world around him.  How is he being outcast if the entire class is being taught Spanish?      PS that does happen in college when you take a foreign language!|`|y9HO1dWsaa	Why are you making such a big deal out of this?    It's great that he is learning a second language.

CmNTc1aSaa	Here are my ideas:  1.  Spanish IV Honors = definitely take it - a lot of people don't realize how much weight colleges put on taking 1 foreign language throughout high school    2.  AP European History = it's a good course in social studies to round out your schedule with;  however, if you don't think you can handle all that work, don't take it    3.  AP Chemistry = stalwart science course; definitely keep it in your schedule    4.  Definitely take your lunch.  You will be so tired and famished and hungry that you will do poorly in ALL your classes; not a wise choice.    5.  I'd switch out of AP Statistics to take Pre-Calculus (or preferably Honors Pre-Calculus) as your math course.    6.  Honors English = nothing you can do about this one; gotta take an English course and plus its good for you    7.  Foods = too bad its required as a consumer ed. course.  I'd wait till senior year to take that or take something maybe a bit more challenging.  I don't know, though, what courses are available at your school, obviously.  If you switch out of Foods, take something like a computers or programming class or something like that.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Honestly, that's a lot of AP classes.  I think you should think about what you will be majoring in college.  for example, if you're not going to be a science major, dump the AP Chem or if you're not going to be a history major, dump AP Euro Hist.  The point of taking AP classes is so that you can test out of the first year of those classes in college, but if you're going to take a major that doesn't require it anyway, there's no point in testing out of that subject.|`|t4xtqjjfaa	I say it looks good, but you are really the judge of how much you can handle. And it also depends how hard AP and honors classes are at your school, at some taking 4 or 5 is very possible but at others two or three is all most people can handle. Having no lunch sounds a little brutal, and you might regret adding that extra class so maybe trim something off so you can have a lunch but still take math, but if you are really dedicated by all means go for it. My advise is if your worried you can't handle it, talk to some people in those classes now and see how much work you're really looking at.|`|c7k3dob1aa	yeah, taking only AP classes depending on what you're going to major on in college is a good idea, and taking a class instead of lunch is a really bad idea... it's not healthy (unless you can eat during foods =) )

Traditionally the moon deities are Female, Luna/Slene, Artemis, Diana, Heng-O etc. Some cultures do have males as their moon deity however off hand Tsuki-Yomi again of Japan is one of the differences from the general norm.

If you want to go to grad school, you have a better shot attending a better university and getting a bio degree than you do at a crappier university with a marine bio degree - not to mention it gives you more options later.

I know that UCLA, San Francisco State University and University of Washington in Seattle offer that major. Boston University, Brown university, Auburn University, Northeastern University, Rutgers University in New Brunswick, UConn offer that major (i just listed the ones that i think are the best ones...there are other less popular schools that have this major) I just couldnt find any in the entire state of Illinois.     and I think UCLA is the best one on the list. It is pretty close to the Pacific Ocean and there is no better place to learn about marine life than the ocean. If you want to stay in the Chicago area, consider majoring in biology (Northwestern, UIC, UIUC probably offers it) and then go into marine biology in graduate school (and go for a masters in it) If you dont mind going out of state, then just go to one of the schools that offer marine biology (this is what i recommend because you will be better off in grad school) and get a masters after that.

However, schools look at your overall GPA when determining whether or not you meet their requirements. I also highly suggest getting into volunteering and extracurriculars because they look great on a college application. Colleges want people who are well-rounded and balancing school full time and doing meaningful work on the side fulfills that. I did a lot of volunteer work over the summers as well as HS sports and that helped me get accepted into a variety of universities as well as obtain scholarships.|`|oTxufwbEaa	College and university admissions offices look at your GPA after you finish high school.

aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	Quote: The Prince by Machiavelli,    "Because how one ought to live is so far removed from how one lives that he who lets go of what is done for that which one ought to do sooner learns ruin than his own preservation: because a man who might want to make a show of goodness in all things necessarily comes to ruin among so many who are not good. Because of this it is necessary for a prince, wanting to maintain himself, to learn how to be able to be not good and to use this and not use it according to necessity."      The above advice is not the common advice given to mayors, senators, presidents, and others in public office. Still, we know that the above advice is practical and will best get the official more power or give the republic less problems.    It seems to me that it should have some punctuation, but it doesn't.    DeeJay.    EDIT:  I just re-read your question.  This is from the book.
AA11513203	Absoutely. But that means *question* what you're taught.   That does NOT mean *REJECT WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE*.    It is the long-time mantra of liberalism to "Question Authority".  But so many people think that means simply *stubbornly rejecting* authority just because you have pre-conceived beliefs that you do not want to give up.    The reason I say this is because of the amount of time I spend in the Biology section dealing with kids coming in "questioning" evolution with absudly TERRIBLE questions like "if we evolved from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys?", which just shows that they haven't really thought about it very hard.   That is not "questioning" evolution ... that is burying your head in the sand and refusing to listen to even a *BASIC* explanation of how evolution works, and why the overwhelming consensus of the world's scientists accept evolution as one of the two CORE concepts of modern biology.    In other words, it's great to ask WHY do the scientists accept something overwhelmingly (like evoution, or the big bang, or global warming, etc.).   Really, really ask WHY.   Scientists aren't exactly morons, so they must have SOME reasons.       By asking questions ... by seriously QUESTIONING the scientific consensus, you learn not only what the power of their evidence is ... but you learn to *think* like a scientist in the process.    But if you're just closing yourself off ... if you're just playing "gotcha' with the teacher ... that's not "questioning" what you're taught.   That's precisely the opposite.|`|YPk5JZtdaa	Yes. If we don't question the world around us then we are wasting our brainpower. The ability to think is what separates us from animals: why should we waste that by passively sitting there, just accepting what a teacher tells us just because they're the teacher? I believe in questioning everything, and the best time to do it when we're children, while we're still open-minded.|`|KikXHTeUaa	Yes. If you don't understand what you are learning then you might as well not learn it at all. If you learn it the wrong way it might be hard to break the habit of doing it the wrong way.|`|cbf5ef436bd348af732ccc7f87e069b9aa	The extreme case of questioning what you are taught is skepticism for its own sake. For example, the Dead Prez song "They Schools" advocates complete distrust of white-run public schools. The cliche "question what you are taught" is a way for a student to rationalize his disrespect/ignorance in class, if he attends class at all. This student is taking skepticism too far.    The opposite extreme, passivity, is like laying down on the couch, watching whatever's on Discovery Channel, and then turning off the TV. You might remember some of what you saw for a while, but if you don't do further research on the topic you probably won't remember it for long, and you'll have an even tougher time explaining it to someone else. Learning is not passive.    Rather than talking about this question in extremes (which I'm sure you didn't have in mind, but I used the examples to illustrate that the question sounds like you are looking at this in black-and-white), I believe students should enter the classroom with an open mind; first question anything you find confusing/unclear about the material presented, thoughtfully consider and compare other possibilities, etc. If you can understand (not necessarily agree with) why people have differing opinions on an issue, then you develop a deeper understanding of the issue. Sometimes it is necessary to accept concepts (esp. in math/science) without knowing every detail of why they work because the proof may be beyond the student's scope of knowledge (e.g. I would expect a high school student to know that there are infinitely many prime numbers, but I would not expect the student to be able to prove it).|`|AA11075358	What they are taught yes definitely! They need to know that there are many different things out there that have different beliefs. But I think that there are a few students who question  the wrong things like their teachers authority or motives for teaching. I don't believe that is right. So question WHAT they are taught yes but not WHO teaches them!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Of course they should; that's all part of the learning process.  For example, my 7th grade English teacher once brought in a speaker to tell us about how the Earth was flat.  Really, they were serious.  Skepticism completely called for.  But there's a line to be drawn between healthy skepticism and religious nonsense, and that can be fuzzy for a lot of people.

kNPJaPmLaa	There is TONS of information on this. The Hull House today has programs that benefits children, families, communities. For example,   here's a quote from the first source listed:    Jane Addams Hull House Association has more than fifteen years of experience working with children in Illinois' child welfare system.  Our programs provide a comprehensive array of supportive services to hundreds of children and families each year.    Services are offered in the areas of foster care, transitional living, independent living, and child advocacy. We work in conjunction with agencies such as the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).    Programs:  Children's Advocacy Center of Southwest Cook County (CAC) - Aims to lesson the trauma a child faces during a sexual abuse investigation.    Ellen Gates Starr House & Kelleys Home (Transitional Living Programs) - Provides support services to youth who are wards of the DCFS system.    Neighbor to Neighbor (Sibling Foster Care) - Works to keep large sibling groups together in stable foster placements.    New Directions (Independent Living) - Aims to secure housing for youths who are wards of DCFS.    Youth Connections (Adolescent Foster Care) - Provides youths with safe, stable structured home environments by utilizing a family-supported adolescent foster care program. [end quote]    Here is a quote form their main page (second source listed below):   "Every morning, afternoon and evening, Jane Addams Hull House Association helps Chicago-area families become stronger, healthier, safer and more self-sufficient.    In almost every neighborhood, Hull House programs and services address the daily problems faced by our neighbors  domestic violence, the need for quality after school programs, issues of concern for seniors, and many others."    That doesn't even count the educational and literacy programs, domestic violence programs, homeless services, housing services, senior services, small business development, workforce development, and youth services.    Read about it, and you will be amazed!!!    Best to you.

d0f5RJ8Jaa	firstly, the test Qs & answers should provide some feedback about what exactly the kids did not understand. focus on that.  an interesting activity to get their attention & motivation could be to have them bring ginger, salt, lemon & some such stuff from home. i've deliberately asked for Them to choose & bring at least one item so that they have greater involvement, rather than you providing all the materials.also, don't specify ALL the items; let them choose whatever they want - it could be a liquid detergent, soap, milk, juice, etc too.   then, grouped together in pairs [since large groups become noisy, as  you mentioned], let them test for acidity or alkalinity.  once they see the change in color & can identify acid & base, move ahead with the lesson. try to elicit as many answers & properties as you can rather than merely feeding the information.  if you are doing the strengths as well, demonstrate the effects of dilute & strong acids & bases [some of these can be done by kids themselves or by having a few responsible kids come up to the table & help in doing it - this works as a great incentive for the kid as well as the class when you promise that everybody can get a chance if they behave, etc...]    hope this helps  all the best|`|N8DC9foaaa	Hi There!    Ok what part of acids and bases are they not getting? Is it the properties (i.e. tastes bitter, tastes sour, electrolytes, etc.), how they place on the pH scale, everyday examples? or all of it?      There are lots of labs that I have used - my favorite being the cabbage juice indicator lab since the students make the indicator that they test with. If it is the properties - I always did a card sort / Venn diagram where I put all the properties on cards and had the students sort them into properties of acids and bases, then we discussed it together and made notes.    There are other ideas I could be happy to share - just need to know what they really missed to give more specific ideas.|`|JwTQdEQvaa	you should do something that they can work in group, for example a lab    labs you can choose to do:    http://www.saskschools.ca/~chem30_dev/5_...    http://www.nclark.net/AcidsBases    http://www.curriki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Co...

Hieroglyphics - designating or pertaining to a pictographic script, particularly that of the ancient Egyptians, in which many of the symbols are conventionalized, recognizable pictures of the things represented.    SHADUF - A device consisting of a long suspended pole weighted at one end and having a bucket at the other end, used in the Near East and especially Egypt for raising water, as for the irrigation of land.     KING MENES - Menes is the name of the Egyptian king credited with founding the First dynasty, sometime around 3100 BC.    KING KHUFU - Khufu was a Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom. He reigned from around 2589 to 2566 B.C. Khufu was the second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty. He is generally accepted as being the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.    Hatshepsut - was the fifth pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty.    THUTMOSE III - Thutmose III was the sixth Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. During the first twenty-two years of Thutmose's reign he was co-regent with his stepmother, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. While she is shown first on surviving monuments, both were assigned the usual royal names and insignia and neither is given any obvious seniority over the other. He served as the head of her armies. After her death and his later rise to being the pharaoh of the kingdom, he created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen; no fewer than seventeen campaigns were conducted, and he conquered from Niy in north Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia.    KING TUT  - Tutankhamun was an Egyptian Pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty ruled 1333 BC  1324 BC during the period of Egyptian history known as the New Kingdom.    CLEOPATRA -Cleopatra VII Philopator was a Hellenistic ruler of Egypt, originally sharing power with her father Ptolemy XII and later with her brothers/husbands Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV; eventually gaining sole rule of Egypt    Mummification - A mummy is a corpse whose skin and flesh have been preserved by either intentional or incidental exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air when bodies are submerged in bogs.  So pretty much, any mummy has been mummified (mummification) if it was preserved.    HOPE I COULD HELP!!!

But it's been a while.  Google might be a better source.  THUTMOSE III - Pretty sure that was King Tut  KING TUT - The English nickname for Thutmose.  CLEOPATRA - Female Pharoa (queen) of Egypt when the Greeks were pwning them.  MUMMIFICATION - Process of preserving corpses so that, when you came back from the dead, you had a body to reinhabit.

Do all of the extra credit even if you are getting good grades because it is much easier and much less stressful going into the final needing 1 point for a 4.0 than going into the final needing a 95% just to pass the class.    Hand all of your homework in in time and have it printed before you even get to class.  Have it neat, tidy, and organized.  First impressions DO count!    Always arrive to class early or on time.  Do not be one of the stragglers that arrive 1/2 way through the class.  Be punctual and pay attention.  Sit in front of the class and take very good notes - even if you already know what the teacher is teaching.  Write down ALL homework assignments and due date (and place a star next to it to make it easy to find)  Also place stars next to what the teacher stresses as being important or something you need to know.  That is a strong hint it will be on the test.    Doing all of these it makes it easy when it comes to test time.

Homework comes first over everything else: set yourself goals and make sure you reach them before you go out and party. Social life is important too, but make sure your work comes first.   With homework, don't travel into unknown territory, use your notes to answer what the teacher is asking for: if you see something that you're not sure is true, or that you're not sure your teacher will agree with, don't say it. Do it correctly, checking to make sure you have no mistakes, and you can't mess up. Look over your homework in detail at least once before you turn it in, and if you're uncertain about something ask your teacher!   With tests, take the notes and make a study guide. Look in the textbook and add anything not in your notes, do not omit anything. Then make someone test you on the study guide, sing the question and answer, whatever. Use memory tricks. If you know it all, then make yourself do an essay on tricky stuff, like really understanding the thing. In the essay, write: know how to understand _____. Then do a problem with _____, or two problems, not omiting anything of any type. Make sure you did it right. Ask your teacher if you can do an essay or extra sheet of problems for extra credit. If she says yes, hand it in the next day. If she hands it back before the test, you'll see your mistakes and be able to fix them   When taking tests, relax. If you're fidgety, or worried that you'll fail the test, you're sure to get a low score.   Remember the most important advice to get good grades is very simple; do well on tests and quizzes to get yourself a A or A-. Do your homework and do what your teacher says, and the chances are fairly good that you'll get an A+. Don't stress yourself. Act cool and calm.   Write good legible notes. Colored pens are fun to write with if you want to get more creative with your notes, but use them only for sections of your notes that you feel will be on a test or that are important. It makes them stand out. Use highlighters if there's something you need to find easily flipping through your notes, but don't highlight too much text or it destroys the point.   Making your notes fun to read will make them much easier to understand when you go back to look!   Watch to determine how your teachers teach, use the same method to learn the information. If they write on the blackboard, take notes; if they lecture, listen hard or record the lecture to listen to multiple times. This sounds simple, but many will find it hard to stay focused for an entire class period. Here is where the hard work comes in - staying focused.   Try to do your homework immediately after school. Time management is essential. If you're given an assignment that's due next week, don't procrastinate; get started the same day you get the assignment (See more about this in Tips).   Note that teachers want you to give them back what they gave you. So give it to them! By now you have learned how the teacher is giving you the information and you have had plenty of time to sink it in. Give it back to the teacher. Do this by using the knowledge they've taught you and apply it to your homework, tests, and projects.   Always do your homework! This can't be stressed enough. It's so easy to forget or to just put it off. Get a calender system for your computer to remind you a few days before the homework is due. If you have trouble remembering it, use a notebook to write it down everyday, right after the teacher assigns it. Homework counts for a large portion of your grade. If your teacher has any extra credit assignments, do them! It won't hurt if you try it out. Even if you get some wrong, I'm sure your teachers will still give you some points back.   Stay organized. A lot of people say this but it really does help. Organizing your locker helps you remember to bring your supplies to class and to your house to do your homework or studying. Organizing your notes will make them much easier to understand l|`|AA10132967	Get off the computer and go crack the books!!!!!!!

The diploma is recognized by the state, otherwise you can test out by taking sufficient credits online, then test out by taking your GED.     The important thing to remember is that accountability is a good thing because it's motivating..I have two step daughters, and one did well, being self-motivating...the other needed the adult. Ask your local groups (find online or word of mouth) if there is anyone who can include you in their home school groups if this is too much for your mother.     I went to alternative private home-school-like situation when I was in 7&8th grade and as a senior. I loved it! I home schooled my autistic son two years (now 25) but I am ill lately and would not be able to pull it off now.     But the local people come out of the woodwork if you search them out...they are usually thrilled to find any others doing it and they have a lot more fun, and apply a lot more learning hands on and through field trips.     Public school is documentedly not the best education nor system of educating, so there's a reason you feel crummy about it. Kids are immature now more than ever, as well, and they can be too cruel.     The social situation is imbalanced and distracting, even though there are some decent things about it. The ratio of too many kids to one teacher is irresponsible on the part of the public school system these days, as well.     Kudos to you!  After you find a little local help, signing out usually requires a two-week notice by the public school, and the paper is simple and short. You can DO this!!!  Not only that, you can speak for yourself. Never mind naysayers..they're all over the place about any subject. You know yourself.

We witness the politicization of this young Russian immigrant as she arrives in the United States in 1886, begins her first job in a sweat-shop, and becomes inflamed by the Haymarket labor riots of 1887. Over the next forty years of her life as an anarchist, she wends her way through the labyrinth of American, Russian, and European radical politics. Living My Life is a graphic description of the labor movement in the United States; of the bitterly-fought battles and ensuing jail terms over free speech, free love, the right to birth control; and of day-by-day political and personal life in Russia immediately following the 1917 revolution. Emma Goldman applies the same unrelenting scrutiny to her political actions and the actions and philosophies of governments as she does to her love affairs and friendships. The power of this book lies in the personal nature of her narrative - in the daily accounts of the friendships, love affairs, doubts, and joys of Emma and her revolutionary colleagues - overlaid on the canvas of major world events

They have little empathy for the child's situation and take no responsibility for adapting instruction so that he can benefit. If you know he is on a 1-2 year old level, then give him instruction that meets his needs.     You will not be getting an assistant because you are not in a public school. That is up to your program to provide. You may speak to his parent and tell her about the many services that he needs that your school cannot offer. He needs such services as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and individualized instruction.    It would behoove you to use professional language when you discuss things related to education. It is a dead giveaway that you probably don't have the education or skills to teach this child.

3OoCiOkAaa	Personification  It is giving human qualities ( feelings, emotions, actions, behaviour) to non-humans  objects or abstract notions.        The bells sang out  The sun smiled down  The warm wind embraced me in his arms  The cold winter wind pinched my nose.  The dog gave me a sarcastic stare  The bath water invited me in  The warm sand caressed my feet  The chocolates seduced me.  The trees danced in the breeze  The seagulls sang a sad song  The chair groaned as the fat man sat down        I would say heat of injustice is likening injustice to something warm not human.    heat of oppression s likening oppression  to something warm not human.      Oasis of freedom and justice is likening freedom and justice to an Oasis.        This is  also an example of repetition and replacement. Some words are repeated and others are replaced. Sweltering is repeated. Heat of injustice is replaced with heat of oppression.      Also :    They are metaphoric examples throughout  , where he makes a direct comparison between two different things as if the subject is the thing it is being compared to. So it is an extended metaphor.        Many people will think because he mentions sweltering it is a personification, but an animal can swelter ( e.g horse can swelter) . It does SPECIFICALLY  have to be a human person quality . Hence the name person (ification).    A state cannot  literally  swelter so it's a metaphor.    A state also cannot be transformed into a oasis of freedom and justice, so again it's a metaphor.      It's like saying he had a ice cold heart, but the small child melted it with his sweet face.  The man's heart is not ice and cannot be melted literally. It is a metaphor .    King used lots of repetition and replacement and metaphors this is a fine example of both together.      The Naomi Campbell example is a simile not a metaphor as the mountains  are likened to her loins. When there is an 'as' or 'like' it is a simile.

If you say "the most famous 'living' person in the history of the world",  it's a bit vague in the sense that if 'living' is intended to imply that the person be still alive, (a) first, we don't have much to go into the 'history of the world'. (b) and second, if we can go into some history, the statement can be interpreted as follows-  "A person who is still alive and whose degree of being famous in the world at some point of his/her life has been the highest among the peak 'famousness' of all living persons". This a very difficult question to answer. How would you answer whether Mandela (who is still alive) was more or less famous in the world in 1990 as compared to Obama in 2008?    If you mean "the most famous 'living' person in the history of the word",  it's not clear which word you're talking about - 'famous', 'living' or 'person'?

What are some of the characteristics of the "Renaissance man" and "Renaissance woman"?     A Renaissance man (or woman) is a man (or woman) who had profound knowledge or abilities in a broad range of endeavors.  The name derives from the historical fact that during the Italian Renaissance members of the gentry (i.e., the noble class) were able to spend their time exploring a number of areas of interest and knowledge.  The classic example of a Renaissance Man is Leonardo Da Vinci who was exceptional asa painter, sculptor, engineer, astronomer, anatomist, biologist, and geologist, and also showed ability as a physicist, architect, philosopher, actor, singer, musician, humanist.     2.  How did Italy's cities help to make it the birthplace of the Renaissance?      Because of their position in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Italian cities were in a unique position to discover and exploit the knowledge which came to Western Europe from the Islamic Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire both of which preserved much of the classic learning of ancient Greece and Rome.  These independent city-states were in fierce competition with one another which provided great motivation for better understanding of the arts and science.  Finally, because they profited handsomely from the newly expanded trade with Islam and the Byzantine Empire, the rulers of these cities had sufficient wealth to sponsor scientific investigation and artistic expression.     3. What was the attitude of the Catholic Church leaders and the wealthy towards the arts? Why?      The Catholic Church was very supportive of the arts as a metaphysical apprehension of a higher reality.  The Catholic Church was vastly wealth and had the resources to sponsor some of the great works of art in the Renaissance because it helped inspire religious feelings and devotion in a largely illiterate population.  Most of the art sponsored by the Catholic Church in this period is of religious themes.  The wealthy were also very supportive of the arts for a couple of reasons:  (1) they gloried in having the best--imaging a painting my Botticelli or a statue by Michelangelo then as the same as having the hottest car or the latest fashions today; (2) much of the art work sponsored by the wealthy was for the benefit of the Church in the hopes that these gifts would help smooth the path to Heaven or reduce the benefactor's time in Purgatory.

NznZENTqaa	i dont think they do, at least i hope not! lol i go to HVS  and i open tabs all the time not to cheat but yea i dont think so anyway.|`|hqKl1Fxaaa	They don't. Trust me, I do all my classes on flvs and I've opened up other windows multiple times without penalty.|`|dCewrtXaaa	They can't tell whether you open a new window, but they have various built-in safeguards against using outside resources, including collaborating with other test-takers. In order to participate in their program, you have to use their software, which is specially designed to detect and prevent different types of cheating. In addition, the timing of each question is short enough that you will not have time to use other resources and still finish the test. You have to log in at a certain time, and the software will export your results when you reach the time limit, whether or not you have finished. There are log-in keys and passwords, and they scramble the order of questions so that students can't sit at adjacent computers and say, "What did you get on  6?" Also if two tests have close to the same log-in times and the same pattern of answers, the software will detect it. Finally, they monitor YA and other answer sites for questions just like the one you just asked, and can obtain your IP address. They know every trick in the book, including many you haven't even dreamed of. And yes, they are going to check, because if you cheat it undermines the value of their program.|`|AA12203012	The way they would know is if their software tells what pages you are clicking on and the time.  Software enables them to tell what pages you went to, what time, how long you were there, etc.  So if they see that you opened a quiz and then went to different pages within a lesson before submitting the quiz, they will know you had more than 1 window open.      Are they going to check?  Probably not unless there is a question about cheating.  If you submit work, they'll probably never check.  Only other reason, would be if you consistently had low grades and then all at once started scoring straight A's.  Red flag that you might be cheating.
ywYIdeCdaa	Each element has a unique electron configuration (hopefully you have already learned this).  The electrons are in certain energy levels and orbitals.  This is the ground state (their original position)    When an atom absorbs energy (for example electricity is passed through neon gas) the electrons jump up to higher energy levels.  The electrons absorb this energy so they have to be in higher energy levels.  They do not keep this energy long and they eventually fall back to their original energy level.  As they fall back to their ground state, they release energy as light.  Each energy level has a certain wavelength, which is seen as a certain color of light (ROY G BIV)    The unique arrangement of electrons in a particular atom produces a unique combination of light as the electrons fall back to their ground state.

CsieMFy0aa	Throughout history, America has been fighting against drug and alcohol abuse in teens and adults. Many ways companies and anti drug groups try to prevent drug and alcohol abuse is through education in school systems and out of school systems. They teach young students about drugs and alcohol before they risk being around them, and they teach older students about drugs while they are around in their daily lives. Are these education programs really necessary? Thata?s the question many people ask, and also the question Ia?m going to attempt to answer.        The government is usually the group that attempts to educate people about the causes and effects of drugs and alcohol through programs such as D.A.R.E (drug abuse resistance education) or S.M.A.R.T. (Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Time-Specified objectives). D.A.R.E. tries to educate kids about drugs and alcohol while S.M.A.R.T. conducts studies to see how effective these programs really are. There have been several studies done that failed to find any value in the DARE program. About 26 million American school children are taught to resist the lure of drugs and alcohol by the DARE program, a studied showed that most of the students who took the 17 week DARE program ended up using drugs and alcohol at the same rate as children who learned about them in a normal health class. Many people think that DARE is the magic bullet to solve the drug and alcohol problems in the nation. Another study conducted in Illinois on about 1800 students, showed that DARE students used the same amount of drugs who did not take the program, and another study concluded that DARE students were more likely to use drugs than students without the education.|`|KjBtYA5Uaa	ok well they should be banned cuz if they drive they can endanger him or other people. and ur opening statement could be     drugds and alcohol should be banned because it can cause harm in amny ways. then u could go on y they are harmful and about teen drinking and drug abuse and stuff like that. so hope i helped and ya thats what i would do dont mke it to complicated its easier than u think

OAKuDqXXaa	Oh come on.  A five paragraph essay is a weak idea.  They are amateurish and generic.  If you are still relying on five paragraph essays, then I can tell you now that you will not get the scholarship.  The readers of these essays look at thousands of submissions.  They spend about a minute or so reading each one.  If you want to impress them, you need something that is powerful and convincing.  A five paragraph essay is neither.  In fact, if I were a reader and saw something that was in a five paragraph essay format, I would only look at your opening and closing paragraphs, because those will tell me everything in the paper.  Congratulations, you have just wasted three paragraphs.  You need to be original and unique if you want to stand out to the readers.  A five paragraph essay will not accomplish this.    And 250 words is enough for one, maybe two paragraphs, of real genuine writing.|`|HresywF6aa	i would answer it with a traditional 5 paragraph because many schools teach only that way of writing because they feel it is more proper and should be the only way used

The study guide might be inaccurate or incomplete. So use your own brain in addition to it.    In my opinion, it is not a question of ethics, unless your professor specifically instructed you to use only what he/she gave you and nothing else.    I'd even run the guide by the professor and see what he/she thinks.|`|so9M313daa	No there's nothing wrong with it. It would be horrible if you could only rely on what your professor gave you. One of the things you'll (hopefully) learn in college is your own pace of learning: If you didn't understand something in class, you will need to get additional info from somewhere else, such as books, papers, or the Internet. But that doesn't mean you have to reinvent the wheel. If somebody else has done it and offers it online, you can absolutely look at their notes.    Just don't copy somebody else's work for a paper or an assignment, that is frowned upon and can get you in trouble.    Also, always make sure what they wrote is accurate and they didn't forget like entire topics that you talked about in class. As somebody else here already said, use your own brain in combination with the study guide :)

Be mature, don't yell or scream, be diplomatic. Perhaps, you can do what adults do when they hand over something important to someone else, ask for a receipt. If you are sure that he is in error, talk to your parents and go to the principal or school board. Start saving/copying/taking pictures of all you assignments. If it escalates, and you do have to take it to the principal or school board, honestly if you have a bad disciplinary record it'll look bad for your credibility, remember it's your word against his. Maybe ask others in your grade or above if they have had similar experiences, if you can establish a pattern of behavior its good news for you.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	It's always a good idea to photocopy stuff you do so you automatically have a copy to hand in AGAIN just in case of things like this.  Any teacher anywhere is bound to be covered up in paperwork.  Remember, you may have 20 classes.  But your teacher also has 20 classes in each of which he has to keep track of 30 students, and many of those students hand in homework late or on sheets of paper that are odd sizes or crumpled up, or they hand it in before or after class, or while he's doing something else and so things do get misplaced from time to time.  So always, always make copies of your homework.  Do all your homework this way from now on.  Even if this one teacher is the only one who ever does this (I promise he won't be), this is a good practice.  Once you go to work, this will inevitably happen again!  Incredible as it seems, this even happens with bills that must be paid, with reports at work that must be filed, with time sheets that have to be handed in, and so on.  Always copy everything!|`|c4225d9583bacc6aaa33ccf6f6ca917aaa	you can photocopy the bigger projects or make sure it is saved on your computer if it is typed up.. then delete it later on after a yr.  to tell you the truth, i just read your title.. your paragraph was too long|`|HpnXe0dcaa	yes very much|`|0XWVUMCAaa	that happened to me and he said i never turned it in  but that dumbass forgot|`|K2o7xcstaa	Yeah and they blame for losing it.

My mom always made copies of our homework. You could try talking to your principal but I don't know what or how much they will do about it. Teachers should have to be very well organized but a lot of them aren't. Some teachers will purposely lose your homework/tests/quizzes because they don't like you or maybe they don't like your family. I had a teacher who told my whole class that we were a bunch of failures. I don't know really what else to say. Some teachers are absolutely horrible and shouldn't be teaching. You should definitely make copies of your work and talk to your principal. Good luck! I hope everything works out for you!|`|6cc45ab8bfdf641ec3d9b0d6e752eed6aa	well...it simply happens.

AA12196812	Yes. It is very important that you come up with a compelling argument. And I am not sure what that could be.

Well then, it seems to be pretty straightforward that you need Spanish to be able to serve the community, with many places having more than 50% Hispanic population.

Also some of the rules are for your safety and to enhance your learning environment.Rules are made so that no one will get hurt and so that everyone does his share and knows what to expect.      Why shouldn't you follow rule? Rule is what will keep you from making a mistake if you know the rules!

dZxjXHA2aa	Dmitri Mendeleev was born at Tobolsk, Siberia in 1834 and died in 1907. Mendeleev studied science at St. Petersburg and graduated in 1856. In 1863 Mendeleev was appointed to a professorship and in 1866 he succeeded to the Chair in the University. Mendeleev is best known for his work on the periodic table; arranging the 63 known elements into a Periodic Table based on atomic mass, which he published in Principles of Chemistry in 1869. His first Periodic Table was compiled on the basis of arranging the elements in ascending order of atomic weight and grouping them by similarity of properties.  He predicted the existence and properties of new elements and pointed out accepted atomic weights that were in error. This organization surpassed attempts at classification by Beguyer de Chancourtois and Newlands and was published a year before the work of Lothar Meyer.    Mendeleev provided for variance from strict atomic weight order, left space for new elements, and predicted three yet-to-be-discovered elements including eke-silicon and eke-boron. His table did not include any of the Noble Gases, however, which had not yet been discovered. The original table has been modified and corrected several times, notably by Moseley, but it had accommodated the discovery of isotopes, rare gases, etc.    Mendeleev anticipated Andrews' concept (1869) of the critical temperature of gases. He also investigated the thermal expansion of liquids, and studied the nature and origin of petroleum. He was considered one of the greatest teachers of his time. In 1890 he resigned his professorship and in 1893 became director of the bureau of weights and measures in St. Petersburg, where he remained until his death in 1907.|`|fLGaUVr0aa	arranged by atomic mass when he first created it holes were in the pattern and he had a theory that according to his pattern more elements would later be discovered  later the table was changed to being arranged by atomic number because it was a more definable number and the atomic number and atomic mass are within decimals places  in early 1800s or mid to late 1700s was when e    he published his theory|`|U6B27cHdaa	-1869  -rends in the properties of the elements  -increasing atomic number  -he saw that there were blanks between some of the elements because they did not fit together by increasing atomic number.  -Now its organized  in horizontal rows, or periods, by order of increasing atomic number, which equals the number of protons in the atomic nucleus of each element.

First, I see they are both even, so let's factor out a 2:    2(4k^3 - 81k)    ok - now, there is a K in both, so let's factor that out:    2k(4k^2 - 81)    Now, you might think you are done, but you aren't -  inside the parenthesis, are a whole bunch of perfect squares: 4, x^2 and 81 and they are subtracted which means I can can factor that!  (Remember this - x^2 - 9 factors into (x+3) and (x-3) )    So (4k^2 - 81) can be factored into: (2k + 9) (2k -  9)    Therefore - your final results?    2k(2k + 9)(2k - 9)    Hope that helps!|`|RYVKYYnAaa	2k^2(4k-81)|`|beMWT6Huaa	k(k+162^.5)(k-162^.5)|`|06c8b760f1fed86f2cd81eb453bf5a4eaa	2(4k^3-81k)|`|VsL16zcNaa	2k(4k^2-81)|`|sK73UzbUaa	is this correct??  2k (4k^2 - 81)  2k (2k -9) (2k+9)

RrvJ99uaaa	At the beginning of the second chapter, however, we are introduced to the "foul wasteland" of the present. Fitzgerald calls it a "valley of ashes" (16), where only the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg look over it from a billboard nearby. This section of the novel can be interpreted as the foul, material-driven world that the main characters live in, and which helps to destroy Gatsby's dream. The eyes of Dr. Eckleburg symbolize in this chapter advertising and materialism gone mad, one of the central themes of the plot.*** Later in the book, right before the climax, Daisy tells Gatsby that he reminds her of an advertisement.*** This statement confirms that Daisy does not like Gatsby for himself, but for the superficial illusion he represents. On a larger scale, it is through advertising that the material aspects of the American Dream are revealed. Hence, it only makes sense that Fitzgerald would use references to advertising throughout the course of his novel. Also in advertising, eternal youth, wealth, and beauty are constantly emphasized, which goes along with Gatsby's youthful dream of Daisy and explains why Fitzgerald never has to develop his characters. Fitzgerald's novel is only one big advertisement, with all the characters involved living with eternal youth, wealth, and beauty that never develop in part because advertisements never develop.   -----------------------  advertisement, pages 40, 125, 167 [36, 119, 160]; See Eckleburg, Doctor T.

nudUEz4Faa	SAT is for admission in American Colleges, Mexico uses GPA's and Entrance examinations, and;    The admission procedures for students in Mexico require that the students applying for a student's visa must have completed their higher-education in that particular field of study.    For example, students who are keen on pursuing medicine from a University in Mexico are generally required to have completed their higher school education in biology or pre-medicine track.    Mexican schools, colleges  and educational institutions abide by the federal policy and nationalized curriculum. The grading scale in Mexico is basically is mainly between 1 and 10, and faculty members give examinations about 5 times each year. The test generally covers the national curriculum.    The selection procedure for admission to Colleges, universities and at other various institutions of higher education varies greatly, depending on the admission to their programs. Entrance examinations and Grade Point Averages (GPAs) are taken into account while selecting students for admission to a particular program of study.    The students must get a minimum prescribed score in the University entrance examinations and the Grade Point Averages (GPAs). Applicants who have written University exams should also arrange for their results. These need to be presented for the admission.    Students are also admitted with a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, but these students must satisfy additional literacy requirements within their first three terms of being admitted in the College or University.|`|qGf6PFPdaa	It usually does.

MiDYJ8tMaa	1. ...prefer the mall TO downtown stores..     The construction with 'prefer' is to use 'to.' There's no comparative form - prefer is an absolute; you either prefer it or you don't.     2. ...vehemently protested AGAINST her party's failure...    The preposition used with 'protest' is 'against.'    3. People who wish to be MODELS...    'People' is plural. Two people can't become one model.    4. ...private practice AND engaging in research.     'Between' requires two  - not one OR another.

411a10352c444c2e97f87fafe76ed068aa	I took the test and found the Barrons CBEST book a great help.  Other companies, also, have good prep books, though.  It would be best to study the older books and the current books.  They have changed the emphasis of the current test, so the new books don't break down the grammar and writing as well as previously.  They concentrate mainly on the math.  But you will have to be expert in the grammar and writing, also.  The older books are going for $1 on internet sites.  Some schools insist you pass all sections, individually, and some accept the average score, with one pass and one fail.  I am talking about the schools where you would take the education masters and/or major.  The schools that hire you will look at the fact that you passed, plus all the additional certifications you have gained.  The CBEST is only the beginning.  They expect you to have a lot more.  More and more principals are going for multiple-certifications.     I did not find the test hard, but it was challenging and a lot of fun.

In my profession, Clinical Lab Science (or Medical Technology), you can do 3 years of college and one year of an internship and start working as a laboratory tech at around $18/hr.  There are many techs that will soon be retiring, so this is likely to need a lot more people entering the field.  It is ranked in the top 20 jobs currently, according to Yahoo.

5N3odm3Qaa	Shadow a radiologist for a day and then see how you feel. It is INCREDIBLY stressful. These days, the politics of medicine interfere with most doctors' ability to help people. It's more of a business.    Just getting your MD will cost you $400,000 to get through college and medical school. Then you get paid beans, treated like scum, and are massively overworked for 4-6 years. It's one of the most thankless jobs. Even when the pay gets really good, you work long hours and have to take night call. If you don't like being woken up at 4 am to read an MRI on 5 out of 7 days a week when you're in your 30s and 40s, consider a field of medicine with a more forgiving work schedule.|`|qWIha03Iaa	I hope to go to school to become a Radiologist also.

QHttGu6naa	Actually, males and females both used to be featured naked in the majority of artwork.    Centuries later, the Roman Catholic Church went back and deemed them inappropriate, and paid artists commissions to paint over their "parts", or in statues used fig leaves to cover them.    However, it wasn't until more recently in history that women's bodies were seen as inappropriate (though they were covered too in a lot of cases). Women were seen as givers of life, not sexual figures (most of the time).    There are arguments that Aphrodite is the only goddess who's never been censored. She came from the sea nude, therefore it's okay for her to remain nude.|`|AA12095483	Um - have you seen any of the classical Greek statues and paintings?  The guy parts are right out there too.

Do not switch languages (retsart credits) or quit all languages (not enough credits). TOugh it out for two more years at least. Study for 5 minutes each night and pay attention in class. Consider getting a tutor or asking for hel pafter or before school from your teacher. Maybe the teacher's teaching style doesn't work for you. In this case, talk to your counsler about switching spanish classes to one with a teacher who teaches in your style. My spanish teacher has a very visual style, which I love, but I have learned to learn well from al lstyles. Maybe yo ushould try this. I hope I helped, but please don't quit spanish, or bye-bye college.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	Hmm I don't think it's that hard but I really think you should stick it out. If you can find a spanish radio and just leave it on when you go to sleep this will help you. Just pay attention in class, if the teacher refuses to speak in English and refuses to allow you to speak English (as does mine) then maybe you should try taking a different foreign language that your school offers.

If you learned good study habits and can make yourself use them, you should do fine.  The environment is much different though.|`|c8cfa81f2edfe585fe682693709f2888aa	A lot of this depends on your study habits and the college you choose to attend. If you pushed yourself in high school and took advanced classes, then college will be about the same. If not, then college will be more of a challenge. My parents always told me that being successful in school starts with the right attitude. If you really believe that you can succeed in your studies, it won't matter what college you go to. If you have that and have good studying skills, you will get through your 4 years of college. Yes, there will be challenges, but those 'bumps in the road' will more than prepare you for life beyond college.     Oh, and the 'real world' doesn't get any easier, kid! Keep your head up, and you'll be fine. :)

Tf1v69Fyaa	ya sure, a teachers resume should be different, you need to give your experience specially if it's in the field of education as other than teaching in class there are so many aspects to a teacher. The school should know your attitude and aptitude in the field of education and also as human being.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	A resume is a record of your work or educational history. There is no such thing as a 'normal' resume. Each resume should reflect accurately the skills and experience that you have and be targeted to the position that you apply for.    Anything that is not addressing the criteria for the job does not need to be stated. E.G., If you are applying for a teaching position and in a past life you were a tailor, you don't need to state that.    Different cultures have a way of presenting a resume layout so you could usefully visit your local or school library to obtain a copy of Best Practice Resumes - just ask the librarian to help you. There are many different books on Resume preparation.    At the most your resume should be two pages and always write a cover-letter which you attach your resume to.    Lots of good stuff too in the Internet if you Google - Best Practice Resumes or best Practice Cover-Letters.    Why don't you go talk with one of the teachers in your college and ask him/her how they secured their post?|`|cbf5ef436bd348af732ccc7f87e069b9aa	For a new teacher, one page is a good length because you have no full-time teaching experience yet. List any student-teaching you did in a "Teaching Experience" section and list any other relevant experience (coaching, tutoring, camp counselor, etc.) in a separate section. If you earned any awards/honors during college put them on the resume as well.    As far as non-teaching related jobs, use your judgment, and if you put them on, put them near the end of the resume. For example, I put my job with ESPN on the resume but left my fast food job off.

wipJ9OE7aa	I answered a question similar to yours a few days ago. So here's my response to that question.   When applying to colleges and universities,you need to fill out the FAFSA ( Free Application for Federal Student Aid) so that the potential school can determine how much financial aid you will be eligible for. On the FAFSA you will need to indicate the school codes or the school that you are interested in attending so that all of those schools can get your information. The form basically asked for information about your family income and how much they might be able to contribute.Note: Many people have difficulty with this process since they require information regarding your family income. After the form is complete you send it in, the information is sent to the schools and they put together a package detailing how much money you are eligible in a variety of forms, loans, grants, etc. From there you'll be able to see how much money you'll need (if you need more), or detemine which loans, grants, etc, you'll be eligible for. Each award letter that you get from each school will vary depending on the cost of tutition and other fees. So for example: it might read something like this..  XYZ University 2009-2010  eligible for the following:  Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $5,000  Subsidized Stafford Loan: $2,000  Ohio Instructional Grant: $500  Pell Grant: $2,000  Total Aid: $9,500  From the list you would know what you're eligible to receive for the whole school year, they would most likely divide the amounts in half and apply half of each to each semester. So, If you accepted all of it for the school year, they would dispurse 1/2 of $9,500 = $4,750 Fall 2009 and then $4,750 during the Spring semester of 2010.  If you only wanted part of the award you could take what you want, for example: You only want the grants but don't want the loans, you could decline the loans. So, anyway, I hope that this information was helpful. The Fafsa application can be done online or you can get a paper application (which can be usually found at the library). I strongly suggest that you go to the Fafsa website that I have included below and read through everything, it is very helpful.|`|ba617fa5a2f42dceb971767a60c2357baa	You can only get financial aid if you are planning to go to undergrad college and you should fill out a FAFSA to start things off after you have decided on your top 5 schools you want to go to.     if undergrad: FAFSA and your school determines how much financial aid you can get.     if graduate: then you only hope is loans through fafsa and possible graduate assistant aid from the school you choose to go to.

jTOZHpPFaa	If I'm giving a speech I like to start it with an anecdote of some kind - preferably one that's amusing - as this is a good way of getting audience attention.    The trick in this approach is to keep it fairly short and then to reference or contrast that anecdote with the main theme or goal of your presentation. Depending on the length of the presentation you can occasionally (or at the end to sum up) reference back to you anecdote - it can sometimes help give structure.    For instance, doing a google search for "autism anecdotes" comes up with the following story in the first result. You could tell this story and then go into your main theme which might be about when autism was discovered, characteristics of autism or autistic savants.    Good luck!    The pianist and composer Thomas Wiggins possessed a phenomenal musical memory and was said to be able to perform some seven thousand piano compositions. His concerts nearly always featured a challenge in which a member of the audience was invited to the stage to play anything he liked, preferably an original work.    No matter what it was, Wiggins, who was also known for his odd grunting and contortions onstage, would play it right back, fumbles and all...    In addition, Wiggins was capable of extraordinary feats of musical dexterity. At an 1865 concert in Philadelphia, for example, he astonished the crowd by playing "Fisher's Hornpipe" in C major with his right hand and "Yankee Doodle" in D major with his left, even as he sang "Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!" in C-sharp major.

nMYxyrzraa	You should talk to your parent/guardian(s) and let them know. They should contact the school/college and advise them as soon as possible, of course it should remain confidential and it sounds like it maybe be much needed feedback. Although it might be difficult for some parents to accept.You shouldn't feel guilty or bad either but think of it as you will be addressing a much needed solution, Often bad teachers are not reviewed or monitored enough, since regular appraisals or in house class monitoring is rarely performed. Teachers should be mindful, responsible and understand that after all they are paid for a service this should bear a quality standard . Some are also judged on the performance results of pupils.    I recall a similar incident with my English teacher back in the days , but since he didn't care much the entire class took it as a free lesson which is counter productive and defeats the objective.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	you must ask him some math questions.

uaFrq2W3aa	i is commonly known as a torturing device among Algebra students every where.  It must drive us all crazy having to be forced to believe what they say is not "real" anyways.    The square root of i is used to describe negative square roots and is yet another thing we must learn, but it is extremely vital to explaining engineering and how electricity works.  I love my Burn Notice and all those other USA network TV shows, and Ipods, and lights without lanterns.  So lesson learned (I asked my Math teacher why it was soooooo important to learn "i" and this is the response I got).|`|nsEbwHNsaa	is is the variable, you have to solve the equation, and you will find what "i" is equal to.|`|eY0MhGfmaa	"i" is an imaginary number.

All I can tell you its an imaginary number, not real, so it is part of the complex numbers system.

Each big cat has four legs: 343 multiplied by 4=1372 legs.    So there are 343 big cats. For each of the big cats there are 7 little cats so: 343 multiplied by 7=2401 little cats.

And he's right.  You do seem to be saying "If X, then Y," or, "If you care what I do, then you must have specifically romantic feelings for me."    But he's also wrong.  The fact that there's no CLEAR causality doesn't mean there's NO causality.  In other words, he shouldn't use your slight over-schematizing of the situation to avoid looking at why he might be so interested in what you're up to.  Perhaps he has feelings that aren't primarily romantic but that have a romantic element.    I think that you need to stop seeing in black and white, while he needs to start seeing, period.  And I'm VERY logical.

S5SvTGTZaa	According to Wiktionary, the explanation is as follows: "A proverb making the observation that turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo".    I guess what it means is that, the more things change, its apparent superficial changing effects only backfires and affirms the opposite truth----that at a deeper levels things are still the same. The other way to look at it is that, if things are not the same at the first place, then why would things still need to change to show no sameness? If the things are the same, but do not want to appear to be the same, so do changes occur in an attempt to show that the things are different----but ironically it showed that these two things are the same, and the change only confirmed the sameness because otherwise, if there is no sameness, there is no need to change. If they are not the same in the first place, then there would be no need to change-----they are already different!     Do you get it? Okay, okay, it's really confusing, I myself don't really get this proverb and am confused, but it's just my guess and interpretation. Hope it's the right interpretation! :) Would someone confirm/correct my words please? Thanks!     Anyway, To start off this essay, explain the quote first and state your position whether you agree/disagree (quote-discussion essays always ask your opinions) Then, cite examples to defend your position. Cite a couple of examples, one is not enough, and cite the reasonable ones. I was thinking about to suggest you to discuss about Obama's message of change, but it's might be too hard and out/beyond the scope. Well, just pick ones you think are good. After that, do a discussion on possible points your opponents would probably use to argue against your position, then to use reason and reflections on the supporting examples you cited to counter them. Finally, overall conclusion.     Good luck! I'd done quote-discussion essay like this before and I am assuming that they are asking for your position (if it's a different type of essay, then ask me again). Clearly state your position and defend it. But first of all understand the quote and know how to discuss it.|`|D2G85SVJaa	First of all, do you agree? If yes, I think that is about                 two types of changes, inside and outside,  the first one never change so even the outside change inside wil be the same... or                 two types of things that we can change or we never will be able to change even thinking that are changing . ..or                more deepy, is about the  end and the begining of our life, cause even thinking that we can improve or increase or make progress  . .  we stay the same DNA body and we will have the same ending : the death !!!
