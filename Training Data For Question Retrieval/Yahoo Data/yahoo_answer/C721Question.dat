20090202181624AAbYFgC	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What kind of onion are recipes referring to when they just specify "onion"?	I've got two recipes I really want to try, and being fairly new at cooking, I'm not up to snuff on some of the "duh"-level cookbook terminology.      So in a recipe that calls for "1 small onion", should I be looking for a small-sized plain white onion? A small-sized yellow onion? Or is there a generic small onion that they are referring to specifically? I'm assuming a red onion would have been specifically mentioned.      In the same vein, if a recipe calls for "1 large onion", is it just a large-sized white onion? Etc., etc., etc.      Thanks for helping out the cooking newb. :)
