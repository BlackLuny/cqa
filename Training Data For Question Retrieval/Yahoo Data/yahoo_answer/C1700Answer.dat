X9oeSbrMaa	As a Qualified Herbalist and a Health Service employee, I don't think there is a drug on this planet that is going to save her life. The drug she is about to be given will help prolong her life, but it will not cure the cancer that is eating away at her.  Jade hasn't been a very likeable person in her public life, but i wouldn't wish cancer on her. Once cancer is in the liver, it is only a matter of time before she succumbs to the illness.  However, miracles DO happen and I wish one for her and her family.|`|qaP03QImaa	Who are you to decide who is deserving?|`|AA11297232	How does a person decide who is the best person to get treatment. Helll, give the girl a break , if she has a chance to lengthen her life-span and the opportunity knocks why shouldn't she take it. Everybody out there can fight there own battles too. There are those Cancer patients that have stood up for their rights and well done to them. Leave the girl alone now, nobody can decide who deserves treatment more than others.|`|tbjujTjsaa	Yes its a disgrace. She only dying as a publicity stunt in any case.|`|21bf104810db24cdcc8e23a34e620563aa	No not because she is famous but because it is her last chance.  She deserves it as much as anybody else and she does have 2 young children, they deserve to have a mum.  What is wrong with you.|`|e2416cd74b40dc2acdaea68721666141aa	the article says that the drug is given to patients whos tumours do not respond to more conventional treatments.

Give her a break.|`|098865ef7b5c5d189da026dca2e7b08daa	sad really. there is alot of people whom have cancer and have to fight (even with severe illness)  just so they are approved to have these drugs.|`|cjmtIOwlaa	How do you know other patients aren't getting these drugs ? This always happens when new drugs enter the market it has nothing to do with being famous.|`|a11810dedcef49b4ee5c4f8c624bb39eaa	how do u know others arn't getting it? bit judgemental dont u think?

I do think however that your priorities need looking at.|`|Ehgfz5nNaa	Some people on Y/A are playing God|`|pVQGhzn2aa	same but she might have the money and .....|`|Kp8ijsmOaa	How about she PAID for  it?

Another bad thing is if it doesn't work for her then it will be put in the press, put down and it will never used again even though it may work for 90% of other people.         Also why should she get it just because she's rich. So you have more right to life if you have money. Thats whats messed up with society.|`|oD3CItU7aa	Doesn't matter who she is, or her views or how rich she is.. a life is a life.. and if it helps her, then at least her kids will have their mum for a bit longer.
AfdyNi9Raa	Because people in the UK, slavishly follow the cult of celebrity and she has been on Big Brother and this seems to be enough.  She does seem a bit thick to me, and without talent but I wouldn't wish her current predicament on her.|`|zZ6wjO6Maa	Intelligence has nothing to do with it - she was scared - fear makes people do things others wouldn't.  She has made her money by surrounding herself with people who do know how the business works.|`|BYuaWsosaa	i am sorry yo say. that  doesn't matter any more.all that's matter is that She is very sick and poor boys will end up having no mum.how sad.   good luck to her and her boys.|`|SrSfZJTKaa	She may not have educated intelligence but she does have a certain media savvy and a willingness to expose all areas of her life. In general people like her, as I said in an earlier answer she reminds me of a hapless puppy that keeps running into patio doors and looks surprised every time. I am appalled by the people that seem to be gloating about her fate. That really is shameful.  The main thing to remember about reality stars is that they got there by being watched, Jade wouldn't get new shows, wouldn't get her contacts renewed and wouldn't have made all this money if people didn't watch her.|`|nW3iJkT5aa	Doesnt matter who it is   People in U.K just cant live without Celebrity Culture|`|yb4FbFiSaa	A lot of celebrities do; look at the X Factor, no talent there.|`|yuTue84caa	because people buy her stuff and watch her shows|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	Perhaps because she has a good agent and lacks any sense of dignity?|`|06da0acef0ef561a9e28c4c4aee9904faa	because people like you are obsessed about reading about her|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Because people buy into the idea of celebrity even if they don't like that person.|`|9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	Because she has been very well advised by someone who is probably taking a very large cut of her money.|`|185809dd4278bafcbf544638ef0777ccaa	she is a marketable product.

NMpbLtuTaa	The rate at which the price of gasoline goes up (as the price of oil goes up) is quicker than the rate at which the price of gasoline goes down (as the price of oil goes down). The asymmetry between oil and gas prices has not been proved to be linked to any illegal conspiracy between oil companies.  I can't rule out illegal activity, however there may be other causes. For example oil companies may have more infrastructure and/or expenses to pay for after the price goes down than they did before the price goes up.|`|oCnf8rVOaa	The reason is as the oil companies say its not the price of a barrel of oil its the price out of Singapore thats sets the price we pay.We are governed by that price not the overnight price of a barrel of oil on the stock exchange|`|48RXUHh8aa	I heard that Airlines are hesitant to lower airfare prices while they have high profit margins.

Hit on all the staff and be rude to customers. He'd play pool instead of doing work. He was fired after numerous complaints (from staff & customers)..including one from me. My complaint was that  after working for 7 hours straight I asked to go for my break and he said "You can have your break if you suck me off" I thought hew was joking at first...I didn't get a break.  He was a complete dick. He stole money from the tills. Gave out free drinks to his friends. Smoke in the office etc.|`|64SObnr5aa	Recently.    I met a guy who claimed to be a music teacher    He then found out that I teach English as a second language in College.    He then contacted one of my students and got her to get more of my students to sign up for music lessons while telling all them we were very close friends.  He asked for the money up front and got it, using my good name.  I had only met him briefly that one time.    Shortly after that he disappeared with the money and no music lessons.     Some of my students turned on me, assuming I was in on it.    When I found out, I invited another teacher into my class that knew the man, plus a member of the police force to back up my story.    There are still some students who believe I was in on it.    I live in China as a transplanted American.    Why in the world would I want to take the chance of ending up in a Chinese prison for a few thousand yuan when I make  more then that in a month?

Some people use violence to get their point across. Name calling is a far better outcome to being violently stabbed because someone took your parking...|`|xE8orz6Daa	Calling names doesn't get your point across though.    Calling someone an idiot or obviously more offencive terms just proves you cannot stand your ground in a debate/argument.    But can also say a lot about a persons character and how they will react...not all "stupid people" will use name calling as a way to win in a conversation...just shows a lack of maturity and obvious problems with emotional sensitivity.

qDLT1eh6aa	I would lose my job for a racist comment, if said in works time/on works property and said to a colleague.  Zero tolerance on racism/ homophobia and sexism, and rightly so in my opinion.|`|i2wbADHbaa	Because this conversation happened at her place of work instead of in her own home.  You have to be made accountable for every minute you are at work|`|7ImwCw9Qaa	The woman would have been okay if she'd apologised.|`|qaP03QImaa	There should be no tolerance of racism whether it's in public or in private.|`|AA12349988	Yes - if I descibed someone as a Golliwog or looking like a Golliwog in a private conversation with a co worker and they reported it I would expect the sack.    This was not a private conversation to a friend in the pub - she was in a work environment to a work colleague - incidentally being paid by members of the public many of whom may have been called or described as looking like a Golliwog and would have found her remark personally offencive.    I would also consider reporting a co worker who made that remark to me as I find it very offencive.|`|0Y6CqSliaa	It's political correctness. It's killing us.|`|Um8osMNuaa	What happened to freedom of speech, are we not allowed to say what we want for fear of people being offended. When l was a child a golliwog was the Robertson's jam logo. lt was a figure of affection, not ridicule, l still have my golliwog badge, and also had a golliwog teddy when l was a child.   No one should lose their job for what they say in a private conversation, if you were to rant racial comments in public or in your work place then that's a different matter, but who decided that golliwog was a racial term, it's just a character used for teddies and badges.|`|b490c76dca3f43fb1bc6059f95de1004aa	No I dont..I think the person that was earwigging should get the sack for causing all this trouble..|`|AA10077992	Of course not - that's way ,way OTT. I can't see what's wrong with the word at all, sorry. I, like many the kids of my generation, collected labels from the Robertson Jam jars for years for our golliwog badges  - I've still got mine . I've probably still got my beloved 3' golliwog in the attic.  Yes - The BBC is very much over reacting - because of the Jonathon Ross debacle - shame|`|EEpBrsSnaa	No i dont.    If she had said it on air then fair enough, but as it was a private conversation then it's no one elses business.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Everyone is to 'politically correct' these days...   Everyone is offended by everything.    If someone said a comment in a meanful racist way then they should be punished. loose their job. If not then they should be suspended?   It depends on the circumstances though.   And if they repeatedly make sexist/homophobic/racist comments (as a joke) they should loose their job.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Yes - if the term is overheard and offensive - then tough, you are racist and offensive and should lose your job. If you dont know how to compose yourself at your workplace thats no one's fault but yours.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	No. Whilst I condemn racism, I also think that private conversations are just that. Whilst one can legislate about what is done or said in public, there are limits, and we seem to be getting increasingly Orwellian as a society.    Besides which, my understanding is that she said that his hair made him look like a Golliwog. That is not actually inherently racist. Golliwogs exist, and it is possible to have hair that looks like one. A mere comparison does not automatically carry a judgement value.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	No because innocent comments are frequently deemed to be racist and if that rule is applied evenly, nobody would be working.
ZoSfx6idaa	i just heard about the extension too. and your right, weve had plenty of time to get ready for it. but i think this is mostly about the government covering their own behinds, because they were supposed to have enough $40 off cupons to send to every house in america who requested one, but they were way off and ran out months ago. they have to send out the discount cupons to everyone on the waiting list plus people who still havent ordered one, and they just needed more time to do it so they put in an extension, so most of the people who arent ready, arent ready because they're waiting on the government to do what it promised, so what it comes down to is more that the government isnt ready than that the public isnt.|`|z0Ot3y3Taa	There are stations already switched over or are going to switch before June.  I beleive the delay was because of the Government running out of money for coupons. If you have cable you dont need to worry, if you don't have cable then you either need a HD antenna or converter box or just get cable if you can :)
yUXOOlAiaa	I agree, one day all these left wing liberal do gooders will wake up and see that their political correctness and social interfering has done far more harm to racial harmony than good. I'm going to start collecting 'gollywogs' as a protest ! lol|`|AA12349988	I would suggest you look up the history of golliwogs, which come from the US deep south and look at some of the pictures associated with them - Golliwogs being feed to the crocodiles, Golliwogs hanging from trees, Golliwogs being treated as slaves.  Even the traditional dress of the Golliwog is how black male house servants were dressed in Alabama in the late 1800's.  What about the book the 3 Golliwogs - with Golly, Woggy and ****** - just a bit of hornless fun hey!!!    The Golliwog was designed as a racist toy - it is rightly deemed as one and calling people it is racist.    We have moved on from there and what was acceptable in the 1970's no longer is.  Do I hear the Daily Mail calling for Captain Pugwash to be brought back to the TV with it's original cast - Master Bates, Seaman Stains all aboard the Black Pig?   Or is that just political correctness and you would be happy for your children to watch that.      Edit - Yes I would say that robinsons as a company was extremely racist in its attitude (especilly in the late 80's and 90's when it stubanly refused to bow to public pressure and remove the hated logo),  and whilst they may have sold a lot of jam - They didn't to me and many others that I know becuase of the logo on the front of their jars.    And as for letting your children watch cartoons with racist and sexual undertones - I am flabbergasted!!      You think it would be acceptable a child to call another child a black pig or say that they look like a golliwog because they have been subjected to it on TV.    I wonder what people reaction would have been if a white sports person had been subject to racist comments by a child of a black leader on BBC.  Or maybe even Michael Johnson had made a comment about white atheletes at the Olympic games.    The right wing racists of this country would be up in arms.      And this was not a private conversation it was said to a work colleague whilst she was being paid by members of the British public - of whom some are black and would have found the comment very racist.  She was given the opportunity to applogise - which she declined and therefore was sacked.  If a co worker made a comment like that to me I would be disgusted and whilst I may not have reported them I would certainly have asked them not to speak like that to me or in my presence.|`|TLgiTFh4aa	I have to agree with you, but you must look at the bigger picture.  The liberal PC brigade are very good at stirring up racial tension, by manipulating sheeple's minds into thinking virtually everything is racist, even harmless nursery rhymes, and now toys. After all, it's their 'job'. That's right. Their job.  If there was none of their manufactured racism, they wouldn't have a job.  For someone to lose their job for flippantly referring to a black person as a golliwog, in private, beggars belief, in my opinion.  But I guess I must be 'racist' for thinking like that.  Oh well.|`|ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	So what about other types of ragdolls - maybe Cabbage Patch Dolls should be banned too - they make people of all colours look hideous!    They should look at who are the people complaining, I bet it's not the black people!  Like it wasn't the Hindus and Muslims complaining about the Gideon Bibles in the UK hospitals!

Isn't it more racist not to sell dolls of different colours.  If we stopped selling dolls of other colours it would look like something of a white supremacist world which is clearly ridiculous.|`|5gta9Y0Caa	will the ***** call a black person a golliwog  it is very bad but again it seem people think that kind of racism is justify|`|DCP2GJDZaa	racism and PC has gone well over the top. it seems that no one but white people can be racist and i feel discriminated against by it. e.g. the UK government tried to get more minorities into work so they were discourage to employ white males if there were a dead heat between women and people of other races. That seems to me that im being discriminated against.     Also you can no longer call balckboards balckboards because its racist even though they were invented before there were mass immigration to the UK they now have to be called chalkboards. ITS STUPID!     To be honest it wouldnt suprise me if they disallowed the colour black to be called black its that bad.    They are fueling racism by banning all this stuff that have been no problem for decades and automatically thinking these things are racist.     I say that people should have a laugh about these things rather than get offended. It makes life better|`|822a369b8f320e09663fcafb542917aeaa	What a sad world we live in today.  I had a golliwog teddy when I was young that my dad won at a fair and I kept for years.  I was devasted when I grew and realised what my beloved toy was supposed to represent.  To me that toy meant love and happiness, but racism.    I may have owned a golliwog but I would never have likened a person to a golliwog and I would be hurt if someone assumed because I owned one that I was racist.|`|k67BvSYlaa	Around the time of the slave trade or thereabouts, theatres' used white males with faces painted with soot etc to play the roles of black people which many people reffered to as Golliwogs.

Remind me again why shes famous?   Oh yeah for being a loud mouth contestant on a reality show and then coming back to the same show as a celebrity (Not sure how that worked!!) and then being racist and demanding!!  So shes more important than All the other people suffering cancer for doing jack S**t!!  Mother Theresa had a little column in the UK papers when she died! Hundreds if not thousands of good people who do charity work, or nurses, or firemen/women are dying because of cancer and they don't get headline status week after week!!!  Like I said its not that I don't feel sorry for her I just don't really care! Personally if me or anyone close to me was going through the same thing I wouldn't want it plastered over everywhere!

She does a lot of interviews and is famous for being famous but that doesnt make her a bad person.  She is a good mother, there has never been a hint of her and drugs scandal or neglect.  She has not had a lot of role models in her young life and she gave up a lot of her education to look after her own mother.  Most people would be commended for that but for some reason she is vilified for it|`|GxaGHGBNaa	Because she made some racial slurs on big brother...|`|9F76AUgfaa	i think now she is in such a critical state, most folk have forgiven her silliness|`|tbjujTjsaa	Because underneath she is such a nice person|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Some people like to feel superior.

But now she is in serious trouble, I am sure most people feel sorry for her.   Her `rude-nature` was not a serious crime.  In one way, this suddenly-curbed  history of her life is a shortened version of what happens to many of us throughout our life.   Her moment of fame. Her rise to a better life. And a sad and shocking possible finale.|`|MLLCn4weaa	I think humans have an uncanny knack of being able to spot a "victim". Jade Goody is classic bullying material. She's a bit dim, so people can take the piss out of her withouth her realising it and she's kind hearted.  People are spiteful.  Unfortunatley there are many who make themselves feel better by comparing themselves to others.  A bit like peodos in prison - the other inmates pick on them because it give  them a chance to feel better about themselves. They are also easily manipulated by the media and lacking in empathy and usually intelligence.    I feel very sorry for her.  You don't have to like or agree with the person to have sympathy for the illness.  The poor girl's got two children, she deserves respect andy sympathy.|`|capCtdkeaa	i have sympathy that she is ill, but i dont like that kind of person. i didnt like her character before she was ill, and that wont change my mind because she is ill.  but that is an awful disease and i wouldnt wish it on her or anyone.  but she is just the kind of person that makes my skin crawl, so i have sympathy for her suffering, but unlike some, am not going to change my opinion just because she is very ill.|`|qDLT1eh6aa	I have sympathy for her, as a mother to another mother.  There cannot be a worse thing than leaving your children motherless, and knowing it like she does. That makes me sad.    I don't know why people lack sympathy ~ yes I can see she is fairly talentless, she is a big mouth and rough but surely it doesn't matter in the end.    We're all equal in the end, when we're gone we're gone.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	If you remember Jade wasn't such a hated figure untile the whole incident with Shilpa Shetty and the bullying that went on.  Prior to this she was just seen as a lovable but dumb character, someone we liked to laugh at but had no bad feelings towards.  After her awful treatment of Shilpa though we were all disgusted, bullying is never acceptable and even though Jade lacks a certain degree of intelligence she should have seen that her behaviour was deplorable.      However, I feel awful for poor Jade.  She is a young woman with her whole life ahead of her.  And when you take account of the fact that she also has two young boys it is utterly heartbreaking.  Everyone has done at least one horrible thing in their life, whether intentionally or unintentionally, or through being drunk or just purely by accident.  This doesn't mean that we all deserve cancer|`|v1uNUcwCaa	people dont like her coz she was racist on CBB the other year  i know some of my friends think she has got what she deserved.    personally i wouldnt wish cancer on anyone its so horrible.    i feel sorry for her kids who dont deserve to lose their mum
AoJKQRNXaa	but let us not forget the yanks used them|`|xDPQ700baa	Theocracies have been known to descend into violence and extreme political changes. You want them to have nukes not knowing that a suicidal nutter bent on using their country to make a point might kick off or sell the weapons to even more unstable governments just to rile the west?    The cold war had different ideologies, they did not have martyrdom as part of the make up. Neither side wanted destruction.    Edited for the comment on the US using the bomb. The circumstance were vastly different to today and saved lives. The option was for a conventional landing that would have required even more destruction and loss of life with conventional weapons, both US and Japan would have had a huge body count.. It does not work when used in comparison to todays political world.    Edit 2 for above.  All I can say is research the subject. The fire bombings killed more people. To take the country you would have had to have bombed them even more to cut US losses for a landing. It was abundantly clear what the consequences would be as the US had fought across the pacific and witnessed first hand the defence of the Japanese soldiers on places like Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  They also had experience of D Day in europe and under no illusions of losses. It would not be an easy task.     Japan had set its stall out when it went on the rampage in China and later the rest of the pacific. It demonstrated its intent and capabilities. The end result was their own fault, the commanders at the time did not want the toll that would have resulted in an opposed landing fought to the last by Japan.    "But i guess it doesn't matter as the Japanese lives must be more expendable than American ones."    Take it all in and digest. The subject is far bigger than that comment.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Yes, it would be a deterrent and would create peace in the region. Iran hasn't attacked another country in over 300 years but has been attacked several times, notably Iraq with the funding and arms of America. It is one of the pioneers in the Middle east, as was shown with their first satellite launch into space. Ahmadinejad continually speaks about development of technologies, economic development and well being. It is a country trying to develop, like many in the Eastern orient.    Unfortunately, Iran openly backs the palestinian people against the Israelis, and as we know the US is the only country allowed to take sides in conflicts. Iran, being one of the only remaining non-puppet governments in the middle east since the Islamic revolution is therefore a threat to Israels expantion programme and we can constantly see floods of propaganda on the internet and in the media, some of which i have already seen in these answers.    I'd like to clear some of this up.  1. Ahmadinejad never said he wants to "wipe israel off the map".  What he said was, whilst quoting an Imam "The imam said that Zionism, like all forms of religious extremism will fall into the pages of history." Those are both not his own words as he was quoting an Imam, and that is both not a direct threat to Israel or a decleration of violence against Israel.    2. He did say "I believe the Israeli government is a fabricated one", but he goes on to say "and the solution is democracy. Allow the palestinians to participate in a free reforendum, and once the needs of the people are met, then you will find peace. What i say only serves cause of durable peace. I want to see durable peace in that part of the world, and democracy is the solution."    However, because Israel speaks out for the human rights of the palestinians and lebanese, it is now the number 1 target for the US and Israeli government propaganda to try and sell another war to the population. In 2004 Iran offered the American goernment and UN officials to conduct a full and un-challenged investigation in Iran to find WMDs and Nuclear treatment for harmful uses equipment and buildings. The US turned down the offer. In 2007 The US intelligence announced having found no evidence for a nuclear weapons program, and Iran was allowed to continue research into nuclear technologies in late 2007.    Iran has done nothing wrong other than speak out against Israel actions in Gaza, lebanon and the west bank. It has never openly threatenned Iran, but Ahmadinejad did say "if Israel were to attack Iran, it would expect a matched retaliation from us."    Israel has purchased 500 bunker-buster bombs which are intended to be used to bomb areas Israel suspects nuclear activity is taking place. However Israel forgets it itself has over 200 highly illegal un-declared nuclear missiles, a nation whos long term aim is to expand to cover much of the middle east.    If Iran had nuclear missiles, i would feel much safer knowing Israel does not go un-challenged in its actions, and cannot attack whomever it pleases any longer.    And to people saying stupid things like "nuclear suicide bombers", thats just stupid. Someone carrying around something that weighs over a tone. How would a suicide bomber get hold of a nuke?    Pakistan has absolutely mountains of nuclear warheads, it was funded, aided and rewarded by the US government for developing them, and it is also the country in which many Islamic extremists go to train. Pakistan is a military dictatorship which could fall at any time. That worry me much more than Iran ever would. In fact, i'd be much happier knowing Iran has nuclear weapons that when i knew Bush did for another 4 years. Thank god he's gone.    Sorry its a bit long.|`|1EzSAU5Haa	KAREN, you are one of the most ignorant people I have ever thought to exist! NONE of these stuff you said has EVER happened in Iran.  Go get some real-world studies before showing off your ignorance!|`|dK0nBUQraa	It is not working too well between India and Pakistan and they both have a bomb.  Besides that, would you feel safe knowing that potential suicide bombers could obtain a nuclear device?|`|hVDchwOlaa	But Iran already said they want to blow up Israel. If they have it, they will use it.|`|Ehgfz5nNaa	India and Pakistan both have bombs but they do not plan to go into a nuclear war so that is a deterrent,  I agree with you that as soon as Iran develops a bomb there will be peace in that region|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	it balanced the power in the middle east.|`|LF6Ox2k2aa	The thing is in the UK and USA we tend not to have Mass public executions  of gay people.   We also don't tend to have people thrown to the crowd to be ripped to  pieces. We also don't assist executions by having children hanging off the persons legs.  Another small detail is none of our leaders ever made  speeches on TV saying "when we get nuclear weapons we will wipe Israel off the map is a sea of holy fire."  Since that speech several people have told me it was a "poor translation" and he meant it in a "good way"  Edit  The USA was attacked by Japan. This led the USA to develop their bomb DURING a war.  So I dont quite see your argument.|`|gSOfgLSoaa	No, it's not hypocrisy at all. The thing is, the US, UK, Russia etc., all (or most, anyway) of the current nuclear powers have proven to be stable and responsible. Iran and North Korea are decidedly not. An unstable country having nuclear weapons is insanely dangerous.|`|d9PdhBvMaa	No because their leadership is not rational. They have religious leaders with archaic ideas and a racist and irrational leader who makes threats against the USA and Israel. He has delared he wants Israel removed from the Middle East but has back pedalled on this because it showed his true colours.  How is peace likely with this sort of leadership? They already wage war with Israel through their puppets Hamas and Hezbollah.|`|hsAeg5pFaa	Listen to Steph and Amir they make the most valid points.|`|cjmtIOwlaa	Yes of course it Hypocrisy, as Shady rightly said the US are the only nation in history to use such weapons in anger yet here they are telling other's not to have them. Perhaps they are scared that some one will do to them what they did to the Japanese.    Edit : tedward,exactly how many Japanese lives were saved through the use of these weapons. It was a mass culling of 2 major cities these were not military targets. But i guess it doesn't matter as the Japanese lives must be more expendable than American ones.|`|1Gm1m30qaa	If Iran gets a large nuclear system, they will send nuclear bombs to Jerusalem.
dhs9QBMoaa	I can honestly say that I have no idea what you're talking about because I make it a point of ignoring Bill O'Reilly.  I used to wonder whether he was as arrogant and right-wing as he always portrayed himself to be, or if he was only a fading star that couldn't bear the idea of stepping out of the spotlight.  I now believe the latter.  I have a feeling he'll become whatever he needs to become in order to stay in the public eye.  In either case, I would continue to ignore him anyway.  I don't think any more of bullying right-wingers than I do of phony attention seekers.|`|dASHruataa	LOL.  No kiddin'?  If I had cable, that would be something I'd like to see.

xDPQ700baa	If you dispute it then you need to present a clear cut case that refutes all the documentation left by the nazis, the physical evidence and the testimonies.    Do a bit of research before making such claims. Visit a camp, extremely sobering seeing ovens and gas chambers. Seeing how the whole thing was set up for one purpose.    Edited to add.    I am finding the nature of the questioning very worrying. You display no idea of what is required to research this. You obviously have made your mind up, I find this very naive and childish and sounds more like angling for kudos from some strange peers? Either way you show no idea nor intent to research this properly.    Edit 2.    "Tedward--worrying? Sorry! I certainly have no intention of resarching it, looking for proof. I may be here CENTURIES doing it. But, if someone can POINT me to a site that proves it, then I can point all OTHER sceptics to it, and job done! I'm still waiting.  13 hours ago"    My point proven then. You choosing to wear blinkers does not expunge all the evidence that is there. Hiding in an ivory tower and waiting for evidence to land on your lap will not get any serious research done.     You are taking the stand point that it did not happen unless you can show evidence now, via the web? Google the holocaust.     Although you will refuse to accept anything that says, you claim it, YOU prove it did not happen. You wade through all the evidence that is out there and you provide the reasons why the existing evidence is all fake. Once again, you want to say it did not happen, you prove it.|`|662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	this kind of question has been asked before, but recently it is being asked alot, especially after the recent attack in Gaza.  one of these answers posted a link for photos to the victims, when I zoomed in the pics I noticed some photo-shop works. of course it is an old pic. and could be renewed but.!!!!   it sure makes you wonder what else could be settled or exaggerated .|`|CqAK1uiNaa	Of course it happened.

Hope you're getting some help for your problems.|`|kXc5WbDlaa	In the years shortly after it happened there were various "official" attempts  to set the record on these events by the Allies. They agreed on the figures at that time. I suppose we need to be reminded that it really happened.  A friend of my mother, a British man who used to run a club in Singapore,  was with the Army who liberated one of the camps. It was his testimony that remains vivid in our memory regarding the actual methods used by the Nazis and also the numbers involved.  I suppose with the passage of time, even events like the Rwandan genocide will recede into the archives as forgotten tales.|`|dK0nBUQraa	The forces that liberated the camps found the ovens with bones in them. They found mass graves and people in a state of living death. They had the testimonies of cooperative guards trying to save their own necks. This question is an insult to the liberating forces and to the people who died.|`|d9PdhBvMaa	There is plenty of evidence and rational and balanced people recognise it. If you need to see the ovens they are there too, but you might have to leave your bedroom if you want to see them. Bigotry and blindness to the truth go hand in hand. But you know this and this is why you keep asking the same silly question.|`|26t0dbQ5aa	If it was a holocaust then why is there a state of Israel?|`|0MunIx8raa	Yes it's true!  They actually called the gas chambers "showers" to lure the people to be executed into the rooms.  They would pack them in there like sardines and then release the gas through these shoots in the windows and would stand outside and look in watching them gasp their last breath.  Then they had big ovens they would throw them into and burn their remains.  An assembly line of death.  Google Dachau Concentration Camp.  You can find several pictures of such events and articles.  Anyone who tried to dispute that this ever happened is an idiot.|`|HBUO10i7aa	WELL I SUPPOSE FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS FROM SURVIVORS WOULDN'T QUALIFY AS "UNBIASED" IN YOUR OPINION OR PICTURES OF THE BONES IN THE FURNACES, OR THE RECORDS THE NAZIS KEPT OR.....I GUESS IF YOU HAVE TO ASK,  YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!|`|MLLCn4weaa	Oh shut up.

I only did one country in the end, and I wasn't the only one working on it, but it still took weeks. So yes, I think those numbers are very accurate, and that there is certainly proof if you can be bothered looking. The whole thing took months with a lot of people working on it, and each cemetery only taking 5 or so minutes to enter.    To add to that, the database was only for Jewish victims, so there would of been more deaths than just the ones we entered.|`|PZYNdUtXaa	Getting handy???    what a horrible horrible turn of phrase.

Or is it just an unproven belief of your own?|`|64SObnr5aa	I will assume that you are asking an honest question.    The evidence is overwhelming -- therefore it really does not need an unbiased attempt to disprove it.    Are the numbers accurate?

Peace  Jim    .|`|idx86u0Gaa	I have been to a former camp Called Madjanek which is sited on the outskirts of the city of Lublin, Poland. This is possibly the most intact camp left where these atrocities happened. Everything is like it was in 1945 when the camp was liberated by the Russian Army. You actually can enter a Gas Chamber and see for yourself. I did not know of this place until i came across it in a Polish Historical Tourist Guide. There is also a mausoleum That contains Ashes of the deceased, that was built after the war by the Polish People. A truly Memorable site although not for the right reasons. I have also visited Auschwitz and Auschwitz-Birkenau, Situated just south west(or east) of Krakow. Although more well known to the world Most of what was committed there was Destroyed. I hope this helps|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	I think that those Nazis who admitted it, such Hoess, commandant of Auschwitz, constituted more than unbiased evidence.

Because Israel has a free hand to do as they please....facing the threat of a very minor warning...or nothing at all.    Because the powerless UN never reacted to any crisis in the region now known as Israel.    Because the brutal Israeli regime disregards basic humanitarian needs.

Just grow up.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	Well yes, but, and there's often a "but" in this extremely difficult conflict, the ship was given the opportunity to enter an Egyptian port.  I assume that was so that its cargo could be independently checked.  It might be a step too far to expect Israel to allow goods to enter Gaza with no inspections at all.  Opening access to imported goods is essential if Gaza is to have any chance at all of its citizens living a normal life, but (that word again), you can't really blame Israel for wanting to check that those essential goods aren't contaminated with weaponry, but (again) who is stopping Israel from re-arming, and should they be stopped? (I think they should, but my opinion matters little).  It seems to me that the UN could provide a useful function here, in that it could, quite easily, provide a monitoring of all the border crossings, and ports.  Israel is greatest at fault in that it will not allow the UN to perform that function, and so the suffering of tens of thousands continues.  The international community seems not to want to be involved, but it wants peace in the region. It is almost as stupid as Israel, which won't talk to Hamas.  How much more suffering, death and injury is needed before those 2 "sides" face the hard fact that they have to talk to one another, sort out their differences, and live alongside one another in peace?|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	Hamas has not yet given up shelling rockets on Israel.

qDLT1eh6aa	I can't believe Carol Thatcher has gotten to the age she is without  ever learning such a basic fact that the term is racist!  Amazing ~ and proof that some people, live in their own little protected bubbles, not actually the real world.|`|6310a09c4d020682e9d6c5ab9ed40ba8aa	Big difference.    Jade's comments were deliberately made in order to upset an individual. As well as that she made them knowing that it was all being filmed and broadcast.    Carol Thatcher made her comment in a private conversation after the show had finished and if someone hadn't got all PC about it no-one would ever have known.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	There isn't any difference. Both didn't mean any harm, both didn't mean it maliciously.     The only differnence i can think of is that Jade Goody's mum was not as well placed & as in control of her life, as Carol Thatcher's.|`|0waBXFsSaa	The difference is C - L - A - S - S  mate!|`|w9NSCkDWaa	one has an IQ over 50  guess which one|`|822a369b8f320e09663fcafb542917aeaa	I personally think they are both ignorant not racist.  But Jade Goody was also a manipulative bully, and I've not yet seen that from Thatcher Jnr.    Jade Goody's antics were televised, which she was more than aware of.  Carol Thatcher stupidly thought her comments would stick between her and her colleagues.      Both these woman are ignorant fools and the less I see or hear of them, the better.|`|zjgQtEXsaa	Well that's the BBC for you!|`|ToztjpAsaa	The major difference is that Jade Goody is not employed as a presenter by a public service broadcaster, paid for by public subscription.    There are a lot of right-wing Thatcher supporters out there, and I think this topic has become a touchstone for all those who would have a go at the so-called "PC liberal culture" that they think is destroying what was, in their eyes, a proud country.  What these people fail to realise is that public opinion and morality has moved on since the 1950s.    The sort of casual racism that emanated from the braying maw of La Thatcher is, to my mind, much more distasteful than the incident surrounding Jade Goody in BB.  Unlike Goody, Thatcher had the "benefit" of a private education.  If that's how my daughter had turned out, I'd want my money back.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	The 2 statements were not similar. Jades was nasty/vindictive and racist..Carols was a minor (not even racist in my book) remark.|`|3Yn5Y03Xaa	There names|`|xdUjRxKzaa	We are living in strange times and sometimes people say something and don't really mean it. Later they're horrified at their lack of judgement but then it's usually too late as someone has 'exploited' the situation for their own ends.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	It's got nothing to do with either of them as people, they are just images on a TV screen to begin with and stories in the press afterwards.    Racism exists in all walks of life, even those bitterly opposed to racism are inflicting their views upon the culture that raised them.    Both of the named individuals achieved fame through reality TV, both are manufactured products. Neither is indispensable, both are talentless. Stop thinking of them as people and they are just political pawns, being used by people who are faceless.    If neither is on TV again, they will be replaced and forgotten. You actually don't care about the presenter, just the presentation. It isn't double standards, it's individual taste. Jeremy Clarkson walked away from worse unscathed, Jonathon Ross got a slap on the wrist and Russell Brand vanished, so what?|`|i2wbADHbaa	I think Carol Thatcher was worse.  She is a well educated and travelled woman, she did it simply because she is racist.    A lot of Jade's comments were out of ignorance, and when you saw the way her mother acted it was generally realised where she had learned this.      Neither of them deserve cancer though,  I would never wish it on anyone|`|AA12279950	I'd say about 30 years

They're for girls.|`|96ndKQncaa	golliwog dolls are cute, i dont own one..i mean i dont see use for it?   is there white dolls exactly like the golliwog?  if there is i mean. touche if you really think it should be banned?  golliwogs shouldnt be banned. i think they should just be sold to collectors & toy museums only  as some people have use for it that isnt the politically correct way of using it|`|ToztjpAsaa	You haven't got the point to this story at all.  In fact you're not even in the same room as the point.    The golliwog character has historical connotations of prejudice, slavery and oppression that many find intensely offensive.    Say what you like about Barbie, but she's just not in the same league.|`|UdwIaCxBaa	They should just please all races and bring out purely asian dolls    : )|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	...and the blow up ones with the real hair...|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	Yes!

We're talking about a toy which is racially offencive.As I explained elsewhere the golliwog was inspired by Minstrelsy which was part of a tradition of "displaying Blackness for the enjoyment and edification of white viewers" that dates back at least to 1441, when captive West Africans were displayed in Portugal.    You're not getting this are you?|`|dK0nBUQraa	In all fairness yes. I find them an absurd representation of my child and utterly offensive.    Steve S.. The Golliwog had nothing to do with slavery etc. until the PC Brigade made it so in the last ten years.  20 years ago nobody connected the two.|`|qDLT1eh6aa	It's not the same.  A baby doll comes in black or white, its a baby doll.  The Golly was an interpretation of negro slaves, something so far back in history it needs to stay there.|`|e29dd74974bc25d59aabc8139b00731caa	yes lets ban anything thats white.  but first of all can we ban the one show because of its stupid presenter .|`|kKswtGMwaa	Why not? And don't give children anything to love and cuddle incase anyone is offended because they don't have one. It is unfair for some to have when some do not. So let us make all children miss out on dolls and teddies in case anyone is offended or envious.
OXP3tSuqaa	No, you're white.  Us crackers can't complain about racism.|`|mDkUmEUzaa	No.  I do however think its sad that our children are being brought up in this crazy time where we all have to watch what we are saying.  I mean, they are trying to change Baa baa black sheep to Baa baa rainbow sheep for gods sake (google it - its true!).  Will we, as parents, end up going to prison in 5 - 10 years time for refusing to cancel Christmas?  It could happen.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	No - doesnt make sense to 'complain' about it - its not racist just let the kid play with the doll.|`|cxip3nA8aa	What I could say right now concerning your intellectual ability would be R rated, so I'll do it calmly.    Don't ask stupid questions.    If I'm a white person wearing a black shirt, heaven forbid! I'm racist! Ahhhhhhhh!!!! You have NO idea what you are talking about, my friend. Colors of toys are not racist. And yeah, whoever Misty is, I agree with her. Learn the story of Snow White, then come back.|`|3Yn5Y03Xaa	no|`|xdUjRxKzaa	They'll probably make you head of the pc brigade!|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Only if you are stupid and ignorant.|`|7BsCJMzRaa	get a grip and get a life, children don't all see "color" like you apparently do|`|zYQtUuzmaa	But why is it racist?|`|bYtCfdwbaa	If the doll was called Honky doll you might have a point.    Are you sure you understand what this is all about?    There's nothing racially offensive about Snow White to any one,black or white but golli wogs are offensive to black people and indeed some white people who consider them in bad taste,myself included.    Golliwogs derived from Blackface Minstrels,white men blacking up.It's to do with the shaping of racist archytypes  as part of a tradition of "displaying Blackness for the enjoyment and edification of white viewers" that dates back at least to 1441, when captive West Africans were displayed in Portugal.    As a small child I remember thinking the Black & White Minstrel show was some sort of surreal white joke against black people.If I'd been black I'd have been raging.  People saying it's just a toy are really just claiming ignorance and ignorance is no excuse.The doll is and always was in very bad taste.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	No|`|MLLCn4weaa	Well, if you can't see the difference between what Snow White is to a white person as a Gollywog is to a black person - then God help you.    What a foolish question.|`|SZdT1r8saa	No.  You would be the racist one then.|`|9e7d9a52405c30a0d39bb6bc1c1a5b6baa	no i dont see why you should complain.  yet at the same time why are white children not allowed to play with gollywogs??? or even to buy them in a shop?|`|1QiPrFyfaa	what would be the point in that. ignorant!|`|AA11221133	Which one do you want to complain about ? the child or the doll ?  Child-NO,  Doll-YES    The doll is being racist by being called snow white.|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	I don't think so.|`|KSAbA57Haa	No, you may want to reconsider your question. The child and the doll are not racist. However your question could be, I doubt that's the case but I might be wrong. No offense intended. Ours is a strange world.|`|7Z9U4f5paa	No. not if you think all black children should play with little black dolls only, then you would be the racist one to even consider that thought. Remember, it's just a doll. Besides.. children will eventually see through their eyes that a doll is just an imaginary person to be a friend to, no matter what color it so happens to be. Also in order for a child to grow and learn they must understand that people come in all colors and races, but if you teach them to just be with their own is not healthy or wise. So, let children be children and then eventually they'll get it later on in their lives.|`|QIwhMrBraa	who, the little girl or the doll?     this is getting seriously stupid, everyones gone too far crying the race card when its totally innocuous. first, snow is white, not black. so i guess whoever made snow is racist, right? what things in nature are black? tar? cant think of much else, can u?    if you dont like the old disney fairy tales, dont read them. buy some politically correct s**te, theres plenty out there. and im sure if you look, you can find a doll that changes colour every 5 minutes.|`|kKswtGMwaa	Not yet but soon Snow White will be renamed in case anyone is offended.|`|KDAAaRanaa	Yes. Snow is a slang term for a type of drug and should be banned!|`|swbS13Xmaa	I see what you mean.  `Snow white and the seven little people` will be the next thing the pc brigade step in and change.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	My neighbors named their child Snowe and their last name is White, think she will be sued for being racist.  The whole thing is retarded.  The world is going to crap and people are complaining about the color and name of a frickin doll.
VHNyiARCaa	Terrorism is just a propaganda word used to serve certain political agendas..    Proof:    When Taliban fought the Russian occupation the Americans supported them with weapons and they were considered heroes and freedom fighters in the U.S. media, Just when they started to fight the American occupation the media started to picture them as terrorists..

AA12349988	100% agree.    It was designed as a racist toy, it has been used a racist name.    It has no use in the 21st Century - relegate it to history where it belongs.    Golliwogs where not founded by Florance Kate Upton (despite your copying and pasting from wikipedia) she named a black minstral doll Golliwog!  The dolls where already in use in the south of the USA - as charactorchures of black people often in hurrendous drawings - being feed to crocidiles, being hung or beaten.  They were dressed in the uniform of black slaves.      Enid Blyton often refered to them as the most stupid of toys in the toy box.

What have I ever done to upset you???|`|i2wbADHbaa	They've been banned for years haven't they?      I never had one neither and I don't know anyone who did.      They are not a harmless toy they were a rubbish stereotype.  You can get black dolls the same as you get white dolls.  In fact you get dolls of all sorts of races, there is no problem with them.  Only with the outdated golly.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	Want to ban Barbie too? A dumb blonde doll who lives with her boyfriend Ken? She doesn't have a job, has a number of lovely homes, horse etc and wardrobes full of clothes but no income? That's not very nice nor is it p.c. either, not a good choice of doll to give to your small daughter who could be influenced to grow up and become a bimbo? Now apply all that to a golliwog, a lovely squishy, happy faced, brightly dressed huggy toy who thousands of children happily took to their beds for years before the stupid p.c. brigade decided it could be offencive. Does this mean that coloured children should not have white dolls or that chinese children can only have dolls who look like them? The worlds gone stark staring mad!|`|568b9f4467fa278aa658b8d4fbbf1a42aa	What a sick individual you are, Gollies have brought pleasure to so many people over many many year's, but now we have a country full of foreigners we have to cow tow to them in case we offend them, if they don't like it let them stay in their own countries, problem solved.|`|3jvrJTUraa	well it might surprise you to know that I DID have one, I won it in a painting competition in 1974, I had my picture in the local paper and not a word was said about golliwogs or the evil they spread.  To me, it was just a nice colourful toy with a big smile.  I was too young to understand that it was supposedly meant to symbolise anything untoward, I played with it as much as I did my other toys, I was very fond of it.    My son has an interracial marriage to a beautiful Indian lady, I adore her and can't wait for the arrival of my first grandchild.  Having a golliwog did not make me support racism, I think it's a terrible shame that they are perceived as toys with sinister undertones.  Perhaps if more youngsters played with them, they would be a lot less prejudiced as they grow older and realise  black and white toys are no different from one another|`|AA10894439	I loved my Golliwogs as a kid, and I think it made me like black people as a result|`|AA11587891	Yeah let's get rid of everything the H&S and politically correct mob want us to get rid of - lets get rid of all offensive items, how about religious symbols?  They offend non believers, let's get rid of kids on the street as they offend many more people than gollywogs do, let's ban kids being allowed out on the streets execept to and from school...... I am all on for this argument!!! LOL|`|34elYDjZaa	I can see how some sections of society could view a golliwog as offencive. But banning them is a silly thing to do, what next should we ban the jews harp, the black cab, the yellow cab, white paint, ****** shoe polish, mecca bingo halls, George and IRA Gershwin, the Forename Israel, St Georges Flag? Start banning soft toys and where will it end?|`|luQ1N9rSaa	What do you mean what purpose do they serve???    What purpose do teddy bears serve?    What purpose do toy cars serve?    Bad examples but you must get my point.    How can it make more sense to ban them than not to ban them. Just leave them be.    If they cause offence - get rid. Oh yeah, thats a great way of looking on things:    If religious christmas cards cause offence to some non christian people - get rid of them.    If youths wearing hoodies cause scare and cause offence to some people - get rid of them.    If noisy children cause offence to some people - get rid of them.    If the whole concept of christmas itself causes offence to some non christian people - get rid of the whole idea.    See the problem?    Why would anyone miss Golly Wogs? Because to some people they might be of sentimental value. It's nice to see things you remember from your childhood still being around.|`|iNfkLWkNaa	No more real purpose than any other toy I suppose but do they really cause real offence to the majority of people?  I don't know but i suspect this has been blown out of proportion because it put Margaret Thatcher's daughter in an extremely embarrassing position.  Remember the rumpus over piggy banks?  That was stoked up by white busybodies rather than the Muslim population.  The trouble is that none of us like or dislike the same things and none of us gets offended by the same things either.  Until we are all lobotomised Stepford Wives we will continue to each have our own dislikes and prejudices because we are human.  Why don't they just ban all this 'hideously white' stuff that's lying around everywhere and confining me indoors!|`|avhgLEu8aa	It's just an obsolete relic from the past.

The character, depicted in the books as a type of rag doll, was reproduced, both by commercial and hobby toy-makers as a children's toy. The toy was known as a "golliwog", and had great popularity in North America, Britain, Europe and Australasia, into the 1960s. While home-made golliwogs were sometimes female, the golliwog was generally male. For this reason, in the period following World War II, the golliwog was seen, along with the teddy bear, as a suitable soft toy for a young boy.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Yet another example of those of a minority opinion trying to force their views upon a majority who feel deluged with pc cr*p!

kKswtGMwaa	I would be surprised in Jews had complained about the name Crusaders, I think it is just lumping them in with those who find offense at everything. The crusades were 1000 years ago, if these muslims were so easily offended by the British and their history why did they move to Britain?  It is just another example of pandering to a minority group who finds offense in almost every area of our lives. If they don't like the name of the team they can boycott the team. How many even knew about the team before someone became upset and the complainers jumped on the bandwagon. I think the team was wrong to change its name.

LWzrCu5caa	The wolves are competing with people in Alaska for food.   Hunting is a major source of food for Alaskans.   With the problems with the economy,  it is a lot cheaper to spend a buck to buy a bullet to bag a moose than to get the same amount of meat at the grocery store.

VgPG5WMsaa	The media wants to be your control how you think. Television is an extremely manipulative media. The average person's self esteem is damaged because he is afraid to express ideas not embraced by the media culture.|`|jezafgESaa	I believe that the Media has the most impact on our self esteem.  It has more then a person saying "You are so stupid, you can't do anything"  I feel the media is the driving force for the recession getting worst.They keep reporting negative on job lose consumers spending and more. If they reported that things are getting better I think we start spending a lot more and it start turning around.
AA10187097	The media affects self-esteem in a negative way for people of all ages,not just teenagers. Emphasis is placed on people's physical appearance to the point where only a small percentage of us can  relate. Not too many overweight or otherwise unattractive people are put in front of a camera. Who can compete with a fantasy?
64SObnr5aa	The media, historically, has always been negative.  The reason is simple, because negative sells and positive does not.    What the media has failed at over the past decades is it is no longer doing its constitutional duty.  It is more or less a mouthpiece for our government.    It is the only business that is expressly protected in our constitution.  They are the final check in the check and balance system by being the watchdog over our system.    Their failure has produced several problems of late.  Two wars and an economy that is in shambles.  They have failed to call our government on its wasteful spending by only throwing soft balls.  They have failed the people in not informing us how much we really pay in taxes and where it all goes.  They have failed us by being a mouthpiece for our government that got us into two wars and not taking to task the lies that got us into them.  They have failed to inform us how our money system works, who benefits, who does not.  They have failed to look at 911 critically.  They have failed us by not going against popular opinion when needed.  They have failed by not asking our government officials hard ball questions.  That is only a start.

Have you ever heard anyone protesting about the millions of white dolls which are on sale? In fact, I heard, a few years ag, that some black people had demanded that black dolls be sold as all dolls were white.

It's a disgrace they were ever continued to be sold. [tsk]      The "Golliwogg" (later "Golliwog") is a character of children's literature created by Florence Kate Upton in the late 19th century, inspired by a blackface minstrel doll which Upton had as a child in America.    Florence Kate Upton was born in 1873 in Flushing, New York, the daughter of English parents who had emigrated to the United States three years previously. Following the death of her father, she moved back to England with her mother and sisters when she was fourteen. There she spent several years drawing and developing her artistic skills. In order to afford tuition to art school, she illustrated a children's book entitled The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg. The 1895 book included a character named the "Golliwogg", who was first described as "a horrid sight, the blackest gnome", but who quickly turned out to be a friendly character, and is later attributed with a "kind face". A product of the blackface minstrel tradition, the character was classic "darkie" iconography. The Golliwogg had jet black skin; bright, red lips; and wild, woolly hair. He wore red trousers, a shirt with a stiff collar, red bow-tie, and a blue jacket with tails  all traditional minstrel attire.      Why don't we just bring back the Black & White Minstrel show hey? I mean it's totally harmless, so why not? [sarcasm]    Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's not racist. Try and look at life beyond yourself and your own world.|`|KDAAaRanaa	The way people are attacking me - IT'S RACIST!!!!    SAVE THE GOLLIWOG!!!!|`|BP5ykmAmaa	i totally agree. when i was a kid i had a gollywog and didnt see it is a race thing at all, infact i remember it being strongly associated with robertsons jam!    when i registered as a childminder i ws told i needed more ethnic dolls, i dont see what the difference is. you have raggedy ann and pippy longstockings that are white ragdolls, so why not have have gollywogs.    i think the name is now seen as racist purely because at the time it was the only black doll in circulation and so was used as an offensive term during racist attacks.. and has since stuck.     As for the comment "when has it been PC to call black people black" what would you like us to call them in order to distinguish who we are talking about. coloured used to be a phrase that was permitted however as some stated they aren't yellow, green and blue!! and to use their nationalities would take forever! I dont see the term 'black' as being offensive and friends i have who are black are happy to be referred to as such. it is the do-gooding white people who decided it was racist,    these days we have to watch everything we say and do incase we are accused of an '-ism' and as someone said being PC has created racisim and made it easier to accuse someone of being racist rather thn stopping it...i mean for heavens sake at one point it was frowned on to sing baa baa black sheep, but we could sing goosy goosy gander..who threw a an old man down the stairs! little rabbit froo froo who bashed the field mice on the head for a fun etc etc the world has gone MAD i tell thee!!|`|tod8jy9Paa	Here is just another case where political correctness has gone to far. It seems ok to call this doll a Golly but when its called by is proper name by adding the word w*g at the end is insulting coloured people Does that mean the same should apply to the word trash as this also is a word describing white people (white trash) a word I have heard many times something that does not worry me at all.  We must not insult our coloured or Muslim brothers but all the ones I know all  think all this is overrated and mostly invented by the white do gooders in the country.I tend to agree with them.If you think the word w*g = worthy oriental gentleman  that seems to me to be a compliment but I guess this will be added to the list of black boards changed to chalk board, Man hole cover changes to person hole cover.

This business of implanting a whole bunch and aborting the extras has to stop, and I'm a firm supporter of the right to choose.
VIJ1XPz0aa	I think its better to see,what Muslims have to say about their religion.They ,at least in theory,should know what Islam is about better.And when they are abroad and in relative safety,many of them start to speak quite frankly.    Irshad Manji, a Canadian Muslim, has published a book titled "The Trouble With Islam". This is what she says:   I appreciate that every faith has its share of Fundamentalists. Christians have their Evangelicals. Jews have the ultra-Orthodox. For God's sake, even Buddhists have fundamentalists. BUT ONLY IN ISLAM THE FUNDAMENTALISM IS THE MAINSTREAM.  All is clear?The fundamentalism in Islam is THE MAINSTREAM.    As the great Ibn Warraq in his book Why I am not a Muslim wrote:There are moderate people among Muslims,but Islam as a whole is not moderate.   Muslims must acknowledge the painful fact that Muslims are the main perpetrators of terrorism.   "Our terrorist sons are an end product of our corrupted culture,"  Abdulrahman al- Rashed  , general manager of the Al-Arabiya televisin, wrote in his daily column in the pan-Arab Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper the article . It ran under the headline "The Painful Truth: All the World Terrorists are Muslims!" "Most perpetrators of suicide operations in buses, schools and   residential buildings around the world for the past 10 years have been Muslims," he wrote. "Muslims will be unable to   cleanse their image unless we admit the scandalous facts,rather than offer condemnations or justifications.Our terrorist sons are an end product of our corrupted culture.The picture is humiliating, painful and harsh for all of us."   The official newspaper of the United   Emirates,newspaper Al-Ittihad published the article by the the Chief redactor Abdallah Rashid,who he says that the   arab worldlost the entire generation of youth,who sold their souls to the terrorist idea.  And then the Chief Redactor of the Al-Ittihad sums up where the true roots of the islamic terrorism should be looked for.  "The brainwashing inspired and condoned BY RELIGION is the only real reason of the arab terrorism,points out Al ittihad.|`|8I9uduIiaa	True.    The cause of Islamic terrorism is Islam.    Nothing outside of Islam *causes* Islamic terrorism.      Now, that is not to say that all Muslims are terrorists; of course not. But I'm still waiting to see moderate Muslims marching the streets in protest of all the violence around the world committed in the name of Islam.    Check out http://www.thereligionofpeace.com  - you'll get a shock at how much Islamic terrorism occurs every single day.|`|QnH9QuQwaa	False    I'd say it was Satan's invention himself, but Jews would disagree.    However, they may agree that Esau's grandson is the father of modern day terrorism.  His descendants attacked Israeli women and children, but were often too cowardly to attack the Israeli army.|`|VHNyiARCaa	When the crusaders entered Jerusalem they slaughtered the Muslims and Jews in great numbers, So can I conclude that Christianity is the root of terrorism? Just wonder how some people use their mind to think!|`|96e3aab15a44e2d58980330a4b91370baa	False, the roots go back to worship of Baal.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	To an extent yes.    Something to know and think about: To understand why, Islam has many parts.      Wahabi Islam.  Mostly where terror occurs. It arose in the 18th century in Saudi Arabia, and would probably have remained insignificant, and considered heretical by the mainstream, but for twentieth century oil wealth. Wahabiism adopts a much more hard-line interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith, and indeed added requirements such as the covering of women and prohibition on them driving cars. The excesses of the Taliban in Afghanistan originated in Wahabiism, as does the al Quaeda terror campaign against the western world.    1.Shia and 2.Sunni strains split within a generation after the death of Mohammed, over disputes about succession. Doctrinal differences are not great, but bitterness and persecution can be extreme. (eg under Saddam Hussein in Iraq).  Sufi Islam is another.  More people are killed by Islamists each year than in all 350 years of the Spanish Inquisition combined.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	False, obviously. There are many peaceful Muslim nations (how about Indonesia?) and millions of peaceful individuals. Fanaticism is not restricted to one religion or another.|`|lMsraUibaa	Please try to understand article below and arrest your prejudice and bigotry.    "Would you believe, when Faruque rang Mark after 4.30 am and explained, religion is for ones spiritual salvation. Should one wish to believe in something or nothing would be up to that individual. However, none of us got any right to shove anything to others throat. Most importantly, the Israel Palestine conflict is not a religious one. It is a conflict of land.                   Then Faruque continued to talk about suicide. He explained, last year 2000 Australians committed suicide none of them found any virgins! According to UN figures, 80 000 farmers around the world committed suicide and they found no virgins too.       Yet when a Palestinian who knows:  1. His/her mother was killed by Israeli bombs.  2. His/her father was murdered by Israeli bullets.  3. His/her sister was violated by Israeli rapists.  4. He/she got no education, job, money, food and water and finally in desperation he/she joins in suicide attack. Would you believe no one try to understand that person. The media in general joins in a jingoism to make fun out of 72 virgins and so on. At that point Mark terminated the call in a rude manner!"|`|236c93851f8140793a37dd76c210a733aa	That's a fallacy.    Islam is a religion of peace. 'terrorism' is engendered by terrorism, Not by a specific religion.|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	Roots lie in the way the followers interpret the teachings.|`|OhrysGKIaa	True, but it really is a matter of interpretation too of the Koran.  Infidels and Jews have been targeted way before Israel was born.|`|3qsGhN5Raa	I believe it is true. Sorry to say it is not a religion of peace that many proclaim it is. I made the effort to read the Koran (a good translation)  And found that Mohammed himself killed six hundred Jews and committed quite a few appalling "crimes" and instructs his followers to do the same. It was enlightening for me to know this. I had assumed they were peaceful. I was wrong.|`|BWvIllhKaa	There have been in history many Christians who committed terrorism. Does that mean that the roots of that terrorism were in Christianity itself? Ask that question to yourself and see how stupid it is.    Edit to tambovi - RIGHT NOW most of the terrorists are islamics yes. Before that, hundreds of years ago, it was christians that were committed terrorism. Before that, it was the Romans. Just stop with your propaganda.

As Menachem Begin said to Anwar Sadat, when somebody said he was going to kill all the Jews, nobody believed him.    If it somebody says it today, we have to believe him.    As to those who weep about Arab children killed. what about about Arab terrorism committed against Jews.     Don't go on about Zionists. The religious Jews of the Beit Yisrael neighborhood, who were blown up by an Arab bomb, were certainly not Zionists.|`|y2oIgwWgaa	it sucks|`|jWNTwnEFaa	Why are you linking to their old charter?

QuGTZJIVaa	No, the media seem to think they can say what they like without criticism.  They say that they are "just finding the truth for the benefit of the peopl" when what they are REALLY doing is making up stories to get an emotional response so people will pay more money to find out more about the "atrocities" that they made up.    Saying sorry doesn't cut it in my book.  Fining them millions, then giving the money to those they made up the stories about or to charities, would hopefully make them think twice about "creating news" rather than reporting it.    ^^Middenraker is a case in point.  Believes one story in one newspaper, spreads the lies, if it creates a big enough response, the other papers will also report on it as it'll make money for them. Doesn't care or question whether it's even true or not.  The story is good, that's all they care about.    Edit: Typical Bigotted Jewish rant? I see, i side with Israel that automatically makes me Jewish.  Does that make you anti-semitic or a Nazi then?  Stop being so pedantic.  ONE newspaper prints a story and you automatically believe it to be true. Show me the link that proves the Times is correct.  Show me the link that proves anything said about this crisis? Any link you give will be biased and one dimensional, that's why i don't listen nor do i trust the media.  I make up my own mind.  If an article sounds too one sided or biased i reject the information.  Each article has to be impartial.  By the way, by resorting to insults means you've already lost the argument.  Learn in future that although you may disagree with others opinions, respect the right that they have them.    Edit again at ol wasisname:  Blimey you don't give up do you? You failed to provide ANY links except the ones in your own head besides, links prove nothing. I accept others opinions, just because i don 't agree with them doesn't make them bigotted. I insulted you first? Son if you took that as an insult i'm surprised you survived high school (that is if you've finished it) Truth is we're not going to agree.  You will not change my stance and i will not change yours.  Stick to answering the question at hand rather than turning it into a petty slandering match.  You are obviously pro-palestinian and have a biased stance against anything that sees Isreal in a positive, victimised or targeted sense, as many of your favoured newspapers like the Times have.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	Media everywhere has turned into a money spinning machine.

English Knight may I point out that you insulted me first. May i also point out that I have offered multiple sources that all carried the same story. Are you saying they are all wrong?

Every newspaper on the planet condemned Israel for 'attacking' the UN school. Never mind that she did no such thing!    But I guarantee you, it won't make any difference. The media will be just as eager to bash Israel again in the future.    Also, remember that the war between Hamas and Israel is NOT over. Hamas keeps breaking the ceasefire; missiles have exploded near two Israeli nursery schools this week.    Hamas openly state they want to destroy every single Jew in the region.

UfsHUCvxaa	i don't know, but it is a two way street  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7...  Crunch 'cost Arabs $2.5 trillion'       Kuwait City's stock exchange lost 38% of its value last year   The global economic crisis has cost Arab countries $2,500bn (1,690bn) in the last four months alone, according to Kuwait's foreign minister.     Sheikh Mohammed al-Sabah told reporters in Kuwait City that oil-rich Gulf Arab states had postponed or cancelled 60% of development projects.     He did not give details for his figures, which were released days before an Arab Economic Summit.     Stock market falls and a low oil price have contributed to the losses.     The biggest loss was an estimated 40% drop in the value of Arab investments abroad, which had previously totalled around $2.5tn, AFP news agency reports.     "The Arab world has lost $2.5 trillion in the past four months," Mr Sabah said after meeting fellow foreign and finance ministers.     Kuwait City is due to open a two-day Arab Economic Summit on Monday, the first of its kind.     Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa earlier described the meeting of 22 heads of state as "the largest and most important" Arab event of 2009.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	Absolutely, too much.

And I agree that many members have a deep seated hatred for the USA.|`|AA12394615	As much as we are dependent.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	Not as much as much as they did during 1973 oil crisis but still they affect the world economy in a significant way.

4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	I was thinking the same thing.  But, the media is only doing it's job. They reported on him in good times, then they need to report on him in bad times as well.      I have no doubt, President Obama will be just fine.  After all, he has only been on the job one month.  President Obama, has to be without a doubt a much better Commander and Chief than George W. Bush ever was.    Have a good day.|`|AA11071860	We live in an age of public relations. If Obama's team is smart and lucky, it should be able to handle all of the publicity. Bush II's team was also smart but made a few glaring mistakes, and by the time his second term was coming to a close, his team didn't have enough time to handle the economic maelstrom.|`|ng7Zon0Haa	obama is taking care of that all on his own,American's are too savvy to keep falling for his "I knew nothing" line,(rezko,ayers,raines,howard,wright,d... solis and so it goes

I have friends with children of nursery and early primary school age and they are taught baa baa black sheep.      These kinds of stories are picked up unfortunately by the tabloids who will do anything to make it seem like multi cultural is a bad word|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	Far too often!    And it's funny how it comes around - a few years ago I joked to friends about how in America you couldn't say 'Brain Storming' any more in case it offended epileptics, and sure enough it turned up in a seminar as Bad Practise!|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Here in India, children learn the rhyme, "10 little Indians" and no ones complaining.

f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Not in my books. I think those that want freedom to openly hate also want freedom to oppress.    I think those that think incitement to racial hatred only applies to ethnic minorities are mistaken. I know of several cases in Scotland where White Scots have, rightly, been prosecuted for racial abuse against White English people. I don't know how it is on the other side of the border. I certainly got called an "F Jock" often enough. I didn't mind too much, but it illustrates that these laws are there for everyone.    I actually was amazed during the world cup, when we as a Nation were reminded not to use racial slurs against the English. They were expecting a lot I guess. I wonder how well it would have been taken by the voices of hate on here.    I think that it is possible to discuss any subject as adults AND manage to do it in a civilised and reasonable way.    What kind of freedom is it that would allow for people to be oppressed and marginalised?|`|aIakDSstaa	In the UK it doesn't, we have a law called Inciting racial hatred|`|aGcRB3pyaa	No it does not, you can be brought up on criminal charges.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Not if you're Caucasian!|`|GOifC7i3aa	it seems some groups aren't protected in the same way as others    it is seen as acceptable to be racist against white people and also to insult the beliefs of christians    whereas there are riots in the streets and criminal charges if others feel ''offended''    i cite again a muslim area of birmingham where signs declairing that ''whites not welcome after 8pm'' were displayed ....and this same area is where white american christians were threatened with violence and threats of proscecution for ''hate crimes'' for distributing christian literature.....yet the literature of other faiths is distributed in the town centre with no threats of violence or proscection    it seems freedom of speech works in favour of minorities and not the majority population of britain who are not protected by it    i cite again a young white teacher who was called ''an f***ing white b**ch'' by a minority pupil.....no action taken    or a school where somalian kids insult each other by calling each other ''dirty christians''.....no action taken here either|`|AoJKQRNXaa	no it does not , but it never stopped you before lol      now I am going to give Dave S a thumbs up lol|`|kXwYz5EKaa	yes it does   Christianity and Islam have homophobic and misogynistic views and nobody ever stops them from spewing that bile|`|i2wbADHbaa	Freedom of speech means you are never going to made to suffer for what you believe it, but it also means that you cannot make people suffer because of what you dont believe in|`|y2oIgwWgaa	no|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Well you can't threaten people and you can't slander them, as two exceptions to "Free speech".  Beyond that, I'm not sure there's any creative hate speech you could come up with that didn't fall under one of those categories.|`|RdHeKBUMaa	No. You shouldn't let Freedom of Speech clash with Civility and Common Sense.    This is not from the PC Brigade, but an individual mind calling for understanding between groups separated by misplaced hatred.|`|s8nPN7pVaa	Not in Europe it doesn't, we have laws against inciting racial or religious hatred ............ that is for the indigenous populations.......!|`|T1EdZqtzaa	If it does allow that type of speech then why is it illegal to say there is not enough evidence to support a Holocaust in gas chambers by Nazis?    And why is it legal to change words by Iranian president from wipe out ZIONISTS to ISrael so they are lost in translation via the media?    YOUR ALL BEEN CENSORED BY BIGOT ZIONISTS
bxlYleZkaa	Right! You can trust no-one.|`|xywgBurHaa	You got it !!    Trust no one !!|`|oEUQiAV1aa	Indians should not TRUST each other because there are no CITIZENS in India. There are only PEOPLE living in India.    Here it is why.    DESPERATION  85% of Indians are languishing in an informal economy to earn $2 a day so that they can feed a MEAL for their family.  Hence their lives oscillate between DESPERATION and FRUSTRATION.  They will SUCCUMB easily to CORRUPTION and vote for a CANDIDATE in ELECTIONS for 100 rupees.    COLLUSION  Remaining Indians are even more DESPERATE because they prefer to evade TAXES.  And without TAXES there is no CIVILIZATION.  And one Indian does not want fellow Indian to SUCCEED.  BRIBE or CASTE is the REAL relation between any two individuals in politics, business, police and judiciary.  Source of REVENUE for Govt is Corporate TAXES.  And only source of FUNDS for Political Parties is Corporate BRIBES.    SOLUTION  I suppose everybody in India should OWN a hand gun.  And arms LICENSE costs just 100 rupees in India.    An armed society is a POLITE society.  And it is not FEAR that keeps us polite -- it is RESPONSIBILITY.
b8uYVhVMaa	Pure unadulterated stupidity.  The problem is that they are running scared of someone suing if their little darling falls over in the playground.

They had a massive snowball fight at break time.|`|0686da9d2bacf24803b5de82b803a52aaa	When the snow melts they just throw mud-bombs round our way!. And there's no H&S executive telling me to manage the mess after!.|`|OxuKo9yWaa	in fact it was so much safer to keep them at home that one of them died on a sledge, down hill.  I think it was more an excuse for teachers to stay in bed.  No wandder we have spineless men and women, if we rup in cotton whole children like this.
BWvIllhKaa	Israel will say that there were weapons on the ship.    Edit to Purple - This question is about Israel not Hamas.|`|lMsraUibaa	Please do not try to spread lies! Enough is enough.

First Jewish colony in Palestine, 1878    http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MA...  to  United Nations Partition Plan-UN Resolution 181, 1947 / Rhodes Armistice Line, 1949    http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MA...  to   Projection of the West Bank Final Status Map presented by Israel, Camp David, July 2000  http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MA...    Who is the ENEMY of Peace? Prove me that I am wrong and I will give you $100.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	let me guess- perhaps it is because Hamas and Hezbollah are well known for using Ambulances (Red Cross/ Crescent sign) to transport weapons, fighters and also as bomb carrying vehicles?    Which means that the ship with "humanitarian aid" just _might_ carry weapons and ammunition. Suspition is enough cause for inspection.    Also- sorry to say this but - "journalists" and "peace activists" are not believable people.   If you want a real aid ship to sail then the people to organise it are the International Red Cross from Geneva.   And even in that case the states perticipating in the conflict can always board such a ship and inspect it for contraband    The right of inspection is guaranteed in the Geneva Convention.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Don't be fooled by the rhetoric. USA recently intercepted an Iranian owned Cypriot registered ship bound for Gaza with humanitarian aid.

They keep shelling rockets on Israel.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	The Israeli army has said that it will ensure that the aid reaches Gaza - they boarded the ship when it continued towards Gaza after being requested to turn back.|`|T1EdZqtzaa	Zionists do not want peace, Joe Bidden said if Peace ever broke out he would not have money or even a job!|`|LWzrCu5caa	Right.    It is OK for Hamas to seize food going to the people but not Israel.    Totally understandable................. ROFL.|`|96e3aab15a44e2d58980330a4b91370baa	That aid is intended for these humans who exist for this purpose.    http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm    I'd imagine that you wouldn't mind if some of that aid was in the form of military ordinance.
K7x1RHVFaa	An important benefit of the switch to all-digital broadcasting is that it will free up parts of the valuable broadcast spectrum for public safety communications such as police, fire departments, and rescue squads. Also, some of the spectrum will be auctioned to companies that will be able to provide consumers with more advanced wireless services (such as wireless broadband).     http://www.dtv.gov/consumercorner.html f...    I think it is a big mistake. It is too dependent on technology that not all can afford and in the case of a natural disaster many will die for that reason. The idiots who tell you they can always be able to flick a switch and shift back to analog are optimists. In the case of a disaster you are lucky if you can return things back to working without thinking of back to the beginning. If as they say they give the analog to the police then do people really think that is going to be shut down in an emergency? No. Instead we are all left in the dark while the police can do as they please. This will be great for martial law but little else.    This is not like the change to telephone from telegraph or mail. This is more likely than not to fail. I expect Florida will be the first State to figure this out but the first Hurricane that comes their way will be the first big failure of the system.    Not to mention I think flat screen televisions will ruin everyone's eyes from too much direct versus reflected light.     I hope it works out for everyone but I have my doubts.    Good Luck.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I think that the theory is that digital will be better for viewing and easier on the infrastructure. But really do we need the government to tell us that we have to have a better picture on the tv? sigh stupid government control. I think that's its just another way to suck our freedoms away bit by bit.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	It is better.|`|JK2RvliYaa	Its to free up bandwidth which is limited and expensive for government use.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Does the phrase new technology mean anything to you..Progress will move forward with you or without you.. also don't join in with the paranoids that see conspiracy with every new thing that comes along..|`|xDPQ700baa	HDTV, High definition or do you mean digital?    High def is industry driven not government driven. It uses digital technology for transmission be it satellite or terrestrial. It is good.    Ordinary digital is government and certainly not better quality. If you know what you are looking for you will see that a good analogue beats a digital signal everyday. Digital is heavily compressed compared to the original source material.     But you can get more channels in and free up bandwidth to flog for a fortune to the cell phone peeps that then flog it all on to you. Although on another note, the old analogue has to move over for the new.|`|uFyycbjiaa	lol. I've asked myself that question before.  Isn't it to free up waves for the police department that they're switching everything over to digital?  I'm not sure.  All I know, is that I'm not ready for the switch. lol.|`|kZW8xXoKaa	I have been thinking about this as well...my guess is to free up the airwaves but I haven't researched this idea yet so I have no clue but it seems suspicious! lol|`|DqbJ9RaZaa	They might be doin it to monitor everybody. Isnt it strange that Google Earth is comin out with monitoring stuff? I wonder, since this stuff is available to the public, what king of REAL tech. the gov. has?!?! Read Behold A Pale Horse by Cooper. The Driver shot Kennedy!!!|`|9LeTSeVcaa	It is because of the government HAARP project. Google it and see the youtube documentaries.   HAARP is a weapon that the government has built in Alaska that works off analog/antennas. They don't want the pubic to pick up their signal, so they have ordered everyone to go digital and has even set up a $40 reimbursement coupon program for ea. T.V. you convert to digital.   Research has found that it can control weather, cause earthquakes, destroy missiles, and possibly be used for mind control worldwide. Russia has invented one too, google it.
s8nPN7pVaa	'Page cannot be found'    Please check and re-post    Here you go ...............      "Air Force: NCOs do not have the moral | Home | Teachers College interarmes fired by Defense Herv Morin"     05/02/2009   Armies attacked by a virus   "For two weeks, the networks of the Ministry of Defense are infected by a virus that has stopped some weapons systems, such as the Rafale Marine, provides IntelligenceOnline. This crisis "scale" raises "serious questions about the safety of French military networks," said the confidential letter     The internal network of the Navy, intra was the first infected by the virus Conflicker [Conficker, according to Microsoft], January 12. Two days later, the staff decided to isolate intra other information systems, but some computers in the Villacoublay air base and the 8th Regiment of transmissions have been infected. On 15 and 16 January, the Navy Rafale "remained nailed to the ground" because they could download their flight parameters. They have subsequently used a different system.     Conflict virus had been identified by Microsoft as of fall 2008. In October, it had warned its customers of the need to make updates to guard. IntelligenceOnline provides that "within the armed forces, these changes have for the most part not been made." It was not until January 16, with three months of delay, for a first take place at the headquarters of the Navy.     "To date, the staff and the Department of Defense do not know how many computers and information systems military may have been contaminated by the virus Conflicker" - a worm that exploits a flaw Service "Server" Windows to duplicate. Good news, however, "Conflicker can not a priori to take control of a remote computer, which exclude the hypothesis of a concerted attack" against the computers of Defense. More than negligence, therefore, malicious. This is not necessarily more reassuring ...     Laurent Teisseire, spokesman for the Department of Defense, explained that "this is the start of curative processes leading to the cessation of the intra de la Marine" and not the action of the virus. According to the Ministry and contrary to what IntelligenceOnline, this case had no impact on operational activity, in particular flights Rafale. However, the virus has caused outages or slowdowns in the computers used for logistics.   French  > English  swapTranslate|`|y2oIgwWgaa	u need to stop cairing about it

Your idea just rewards people for being irresponsible.      Instead, put the money into something that will create jobs.  Then, people can start making money again and pay their own mortgages.|`|DNCmoJsiaa	Because it eliminates responsibility which is exactly the same reason that the current bailouts will not work or stimulate the economy.    People will be told that it is not their responsibility to pay off their debts, that it is the governments responsibility.  Thus people who no longer have to meet mortage payments will go out and blow there money on other non necessary goods.  Therefore they will quickly accumilate other debts with higher "credit card" intrests.  Instead of having to pay off one large debt with a realitively small intrest, now they are faced with paying off many medium debts with extreme intrests.  Of course they will default on the loans and the situation worssens.    The only true, real solution to the current economy is very painful.  Let the banks and corporations fail.  Let homowners default and loose their homes.  The economy will eventually work itself out, as people will have to learn to live lean.|`|bxlYleZkaa	What value money then? And who'd actually own the house?? In the UK all the land is owned by the Crown, so when you buy a house you get title to Freely hold" the land it sits on  (the "Freehold" and in effect only own the bricks and mortar. In the US and other places ownership of land is different, so who would own the land if not the government who put up the money?

9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	I used to collect Robertson's jam golliwog brooches when I was a child. I also had a much loved golliwog doll which held pride of place next to my Teddy Bear.    My old home in England was built with brick reclaimed from Enid Blyton's house after she died...    Am I racist? I don't think so. My friends collectively are like a mini United Nations and my husband certainly isn't white!    I have been called the Gurri (whitey) by the Pakistani contingent in our neighbourhood for years and it hasn't scarred my soul!    The world has far greater problems to fix than the window dressing of banning golliwogs.    Sometimes I despair!|`|RwzlaG8baa	The only people who have a problem with things like golliwogs are white. Seems like they think black people can't speak for themselves. So who are the racists?|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I don't think it's the colour of the doll that makes it racist, it's the fact that it's called a golliwog.  I don't know the origins of the word, but I do know that Enid Blyton, who was racist, originally used the word golliwog to describe the villains in her stories.  Today in Noddy the bad guys are called goblins, but they used to be called golliwogs and they were the only black characters in her stories.    (Actually, I agree with you that in many cases political correctness has gone too far. People are so sensitive about everything these days.)
GOifC7i3aa	yes of course you are right    the very people doing the killing in darfur in the hundreds of thousands are the very people getting support in our media where they are often portrayed as 'freedom fighters'    it is not politically correct to criticise muslims in darfur but absolutely compulsory to criticise jews in the middle east|`|DuOl2cFXaa	You said it all. The BBC is very pro Muslim!  They all seem to be left wing liberal Guardian readers!|`|UNw3L5qfaa	What a racist question.    The issue is that in Darfur the world is doing what they can, the UN is there doing what it can, what do you want the average person to do?    However in palestine it is Israel killing people, UN officials and attacking food convoys. The UN keeps trying to get people in to help and yet it is Israel which keeps stopping them with the support of the American government and British government. Hense, people are trying to get a democratic government to do the demands of its people.    That's democracy.    and anti-jewish agenda? They refused to broadcast a charity appeal for a a humanitarian disaster, the first time in the BBC's history.    But what am i saying? You just want someone to say "yes you are right, damn islam and its terrorists, lets bomb them, Iran down with them, gaza kill them all, splash the media with Jewish suffering and Hatred towards the arab world".    You're full of hate.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Because the media are the mouthpiece of the establishment, for all their protests of impartiality.  The BBC are extrememly biased against Israel and the Jews.

Any killing is horrific & that should be our focus. Not which country doing it gets more attention than any other.|`|WC55CP9qaa	Perhaps it is because the massacres in Darfur are carried out by Arab Sudanese whom the BBC are not eager to condemn?  Everyone seems to be on the anti-Israeli bandwagon these days. I detect a trend that developed during the last Israeli incursion into Gaza when the BBC began to lose a degree of objectivity.   They seem to have had a top down change.|`|AA11068194	because they are biased but they also reflect the general will of politicians|`|AA11366224	It's because the people doing the killings in Darfur are ill-disciplined terrorists whereas the ill-disciplined terrorists killing Palestinians are supposed to be the armed services of a civilised state.
1G3XPiq3aa	It's disgusting. Israel hasn't withdrawn from Gaza, hasn't opened the border crossings, and can refuse aid like this. They've killed them quickly with bombs and bullets and white phosphorus, now they're just going to kill them slowly by denying them access to the aid they so desperately need. My daughter wanted to send some of her toys to the children who'd lost everything when their homes were destroyed, and I couldn't even think of a way to explain how Israel is allowed to get away with denying them access to the aid other countries send.|`|IGGmNExRaa	israel is a rogue state and acts accordingly|`|T1EdZqtzaa	Israel wants to wipe out a population they do not recognize becuase they are not JEWISH, and it is a JEWISH MAJORITY they need to rule with JEWISH LAWS, and ban Christians and Muslims.    There claim is based on Abraham the great grand father of jacob/israel, who had two wives, but the pagan tribes then did not recognize slaves as wives and one of them was a slave, Haggar,     so you have a contradiction:  Abraham marries Haggar, has Ishmael, his first born ...  Then he marry s his sister Sarah, has Isaac., who they replaced the name of as the sacraficial child in the Torah with a pen.    But today so called Jews of the 21st century who are mostly converts claim since pagans did not recognize Hagar as a legit wife, so they decide not to as well, and only recognize Sarah the sister/wife, which is Religiously un acceptable in TORAH LAW and SIN) ..    To make a further point of the argument against Hagar for not been equal as God demands us to be with woman, the children of Israel aka the 12 tribes where also children of woman who where slave wives, so whats there reason for preferring a sister from the grandfathers side, sounds like a scam Zionists learned to pull off in the recent years.|`|MFcbRot8aa	Why didn't they try to send the supplies across an Egyptian border crossing?|`|w6GIrVgPaa	When the supposed civilians stop firing and hiring weapons inside civilian infrastructure the situation will be better, but since your supposed civilians tend to carry guns, missiles and other weapons anything should be subject to inspection. If you read the full article you will see that the aid will arrive, anyway, why a lebanon boat needs to pass through Israeli waters? they should go through the Egiptian border.

Plus, it's the government making the switch, so why shouldn't the government be involved?  I don't agree with the extension because people have had more than enough time to prepare, but then the stations that have already hired the crews and scheduled the changeover are free to do so.

I actually feel sympathy at one level for Holocaust deniers, because they are showing the depth of their ignorance and how they have been manipulated by those with an agenda of some kind who are looking for losers to become followers.    There's NO benign reason to deny the Holocaust, just as there is no benign reason to deny that people once thought the earth was flat.    The only reason to deny the bad things in history is to try to denigrate those who experienced them and build a false image of those who did them. It denies the humanity of all involved.

Who said I worried about it?Do you worry about the British denial of the Irish Holocaust?I said it's common and even more common when grievances are involved.    English Knight:No decent human being denies these atrocities and they should never be forgotten.    What about the British atrocity in Ireland,shipping food out  while a nation starved by the millions?Forgot that quick enough.    I'm not entirely convinced he did deny the Holocaust.The conference on the Holocaust was open to anyone to attend and was intended to counter the right to openly discuss the Holocaust and came in the wake of the Danish Cartoons case so no doubt he timed it then as a way of saying 'well if you're going to break tabboos so can anyone'.He even invited Tony Blair to attend.    I believe the Holocaust happened,that millions died,not all Jews but by far and away the majority but if you take all the people who died in that war then probably the Russians took the biggest toll.  I believe to flat out deny it is wrong,to openly discuss it for the sake of clarity can only help as it will make it easier to convince those in denial.  By saying you shouldn't query it you are implying it is off limits.The more it is questioned the clearer the facts,the less chance for folk to deny it I would have thought.Putting it off limits makes it seem shady like there's something to hide when clearly there isn't.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Anyone who denies or questions the holocaust is ALWAYS doing it from a particular point of view or bias.  There is no reason, excuse or motive for denying the holocaust or the number of victims or methods used.  Anyone doing this is utterly abhorrent to me, and I cannot even begin to engage with someone who denies the facts of what the Nazis did.|`|Ij02BDygaa	I think because there is so much lies told these days that people are starting to question things and thats a good thing,    I dont know it the holocaust was as bad as they say, I was not there, The red cross say there was something more like 221,000 killed in that time and i read that the jewish population increased from 1934 to 1944 so i dont know.    Where is the 6 million bodies?|`|xdUjRxKzaa	I've got to say i think that with all the evidence they have either got to be brain dead or alien. They should be taken to Auschwitz or one of the other camps. Perhaps, like Thomas, they would like to feel the hair of those victims or touch the lamp shades made from their skin or even look at the photographs of the operations, done without anaesthetic on twins. They ought to hang their heads in shame.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Ignorance and insecurity could only explain such denial.|`|MLLCn4weaa	No, not really.  Maybe, perhaps if you're under 14 and live in a home where world history isn't a part of life.  Otherwise, no - the only reason to query it is sadlly - cruel belligerent and pure racism.|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	Sadly skidoo, some people just won't believe the evidence in front of their eyes.    My brother is not stupid, but he believes the moon landings where faked, despite the wealth of evidence showing they are real.    Try conversing with the 9/11 conspirators and you end up discussing the melting points of metals. Disprove one claim and they immediately jump to another, its scatter shot opinions and you can't convince them that what they saw with their eyes was actually what happened. I suppose this is how illusionists and hypnotists get away with it.    The thing about the Nazi's is they where petty bureaucrats, and loved nothing more than cataloguing their atrocities. Its all there in black and white for anyone too see, but some people are so convinced that they are right that they will argue an apple goes up when it falls from a tree.    Its best to just ignore them.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Seeing as though it is a criminal law to deny the holocaust in Germany shows that it's taken seriously.  Why would a country have a law about a 'conspiracy theory' as some have labelled it?Why did the Nazi's feel the need to burn the 'evidence' or knowledge of the existence of the camps if it 'never happened'?    The soldiers who found the camps, the civilians involved in the 'clean up', the survivors who suffered and gave testiment, the Nuremberg Trials.  The list goes on and on. All lies??? Methinks not somehow.    I've found that mostly extremists and anti-Israeli nutters use the denial of the Holocaust as justification to slaughter innocents in the Middle East and to spread hatred of the Jewish faith and the Nation of Israel. No decent human being denies these atrocities and they should never be forgotten.|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	I asked a survivor what he thought when people denied it.    His reply was "anti-Semites"    As to Red Cross figures, they can only relate to *concentration* camps in Germany & Austria.    The Red Cross had nothing to do with the *extermination camps in Eastern Poland, Such as Auschwitz, Maidanek, and Sobibor.    In any event, Nazis such Hoess, commandant of Auschwitz not only admitted it at the Nuremberg trials, but was proud of the improvements he had made in the system.    Where were the bodies? Crematoria or made into soap.    What do you think the gas chambers were for?

w6GIrVgPaa	Because it is close also, Egyptians are afraid of Hamas radicalism so they prefer to close the border than to take the risk of having Hamas militants inside it.    When Lebanon allowed palestinian militants inside it, it was the end of the glory Lebanon, Lebanon was a great country before 1965 until they allowed the PLO inside which caused many civilian confrontations so Egypt learned from the history|`|8I9uduIiaa	Precisely.    Egypt could have allowed all the women and children to leave Gaza, while the Israelis went in and dealt with Hamas and their terrorist-loving supporters.     Egypt could have - and indeed was asked - to stop the tunnels that led into Gaza from being used to smuggle arms to Hamas. Egypt refused to monitor those tunnels, and refused to let any other force from any other nation monitor them either!    Note: when Egypt occupied Gaza, before 1967, she stuck the Palestinians in refugee camps, mined the borders, then left them there to rot and garner world sympathy.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Because the Arabs care little about the Palestinians just like the Jews.    Truth is the fighting is shameful and an example of how religion divides humanity.  Even when one party isn't all that religious.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	Why not ask this to Egypt?    Probably they don't want anything to do with Hamas radicals. You know something whoever has supported the terrorists has got their hands burnt. Just see Pakistan. They harbored terrorists, trained them to operate against India and Afghanistan and now terrorists are playing havoc on Pakistan. Seems Egypt has learned lessons from others mistakes.|`|YBbJ2QZJaa	That would interfere with the propaganda.|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090204/ap_o...     Spokesman Christopher Gunness says Hamas police raided a U.N. warehouse in Gaza City on Tuesday evening. He says police snatched 3,500 blankets and more than 400 food parcels.    The aid is vital now because Gazans are facing hardship after Israel's three-week military offensive against Hamas.    Hamas has ruled Gaza since it seized control of the territory in 2007. Gunness said Wednesday this is the first time Hamas has seized U.N. aid.    Israeli officials have charged that the militant group routinely confiscates supplies meant for needy Gazans.    A Hamas government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Because legitimate governments can function in daylight under transparent conditions and don't have to resort to underground maneuvers in secrecy. There would be no reason to smuggle anything if they would just give up their arms and hostilities.     Minimal supplies do actually make it across the border into Gaza by normal means they are not completely shut off.  The significant blockade was a result of the Hamas brutal takeover of Fatah in 2007 and their smuggling in weapons in bags of flour and coffee.  They just need to straighten up and get their supplies like the rest of the world gets them, thru hard work and trade.  Then they could use other means for transportation above ground other than some smuggling black market underground tunnels that usurp a democratic system.    Instead of making their skyscraper on an oasis of prime beach front real estate on the Med Sea above ground, they proceeded to make THOUSANDS of tunnels  like some strange underground society?!  They booby trapped tunnels to their homes, wired schools & zoos and then sent rockets into Israel. One of the tunnels extended 300 yards into Israel from the Northern part of Gaza and its purpose to kidnap Israelis.    All  those thousands of tunnels had multiple purpose, as a military strategy, to smuggle weapons thru Gaza-Egypt border, and also for smuggling foodstuffs and cigarettes and whatever else they wanted for black market trade.     When Israel bombed the tunnels Israel did leave one tunnel open, and this was solely a humanitarian tunnel the only legitimate one.  It was the tunnel that provides fuel to Gaza from Egypt. It was a particular clan that had control of that tunnel, and it wasn't used by Hamas.  At the end of the operation, Hamas ended up seizing the tunnel from that clan, so they could then continue to smuggle in weapons.     It is Egypt's vow as part to finally control the smuggling on their side, let's hope they do it. As far as the smuggling that was off the waters we have Israel and allies monitoring that smuggling.    Latest current event is that Hamas militants siezed aid by force from a UN depot.  It was donated by internationalists and destined for some needy families. They have a history of usurping by force any normal societal systems set up. The  Hamas-Fatah takeover exhibited their destructive powers that are in conflict with a constructive society. Here are a few examples.  I need to note while I do frequently say Hamas, it is actually a militant "free for all" with no regard to normal cultures or societies they have developed their own system very much apart from Western culture and values:  The militants pose significant risk to any people they do business with as they will use force for hostile takeover, that is their track record and the reason why these militants were kicked out of Jordan and Lebanon and why Egypt doesn't want them either.    "Additionally, dozens of public institutions throughout the Gaza Strip were attacked and robbed, including schools, colleges, post offices, police stations, clinics, and offices of ministries and governorates.    ?

Ti0q1Btiaa	With their police and their army being paid more by the drug cartel than their government wages, Mexico is in deep sh**.    The US can intervene with handouts to out bid the cartels or just continue to allow our US druggies, who steal from citizens here, in order to support the cartels.    I suspect that their president is also being paid.    I once had business dealings in Mexico, through the brother-in-law of the president.

77daNNz5aa	Well, the drugs is one take on it. The media is another, but check out the book "Rampage" where the author looks at 2 case studies of early school shootings and develops the necessary criteria for one to occur. She found that the most important factors were   1. marginalization in regards to peers,   2. Mental/familial issues,   3. Media influence/cultural script --all perps were males and by and large they were influenced by what media tells them is what a manly man will act like to get attention.  4. Under the radar  5. Access to guns|`|9CK62mixaa	In reality is not video games and the like creating or making people shoot others, is psychiatric drugs that is making kids snap and become violent.   see for yourself: http://www.cchr.org/ /psych-drugs/psych-...    from insert:   Janet, a teenager who was prescribed minor tranquilizers and antidepressants, said that while withdrawing from these drugs, she had violent thoughts and had to restrain her aggressiveness, including wanting to stab anyone who withheld the decreasing drug dosage from her: "I had absolutely no history of violence. These new feelings were not part of the so-called mental illness I was suppose to have; I had never been aggressive before being prescribed the drugs. Once safely and gradually withdrawn from them, I never experienced uncontrollable violent urges again." 32    As noted earlier, even the APA euphemistically admits in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual that the major complication of withdrawal from Ritalin, a psychiatric drug currently being administered to millions of children, is suicide.    Withdrawal effects from these drugs can be severe and take intense medical supervision to ensure the person safely detoxes. As an example, Stevie Nicks, of the rock group Fleetwood Mac, talks about the intense difficulty of detoxing from psychiatric drugs: "I'm the one who realized that that's what was killing me [the psychiatric drug, Klonopin]". It took her 45 days to withdraw from the Klonopin. "I was in there sick for 45 days, really, really sick. And I watched generations of drug addicts come in and go out. You know, the heroin people, 12 days and they're gone. And I'm still just there." 33    Viewed against this research and the dramatic increase in the use of mind-altering drugs by children and adults alike, the cause for the rise of senseless violence becomes all too clear.    Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) International has a database of hundreds of cases of violence that span the last 15 years. The following are but a few examples:    (1) On March 6, 1985, Atlanta postal worker Steven W. Brownlee, pulled a pistol from his pocket and shot and killed a supervisor and a clerk. Another clerk was wounded. Brownlee had received treatment and psychotropic drugs at the Grady Memorial Psychiatric Unit. 34    (2) On November 20, 1986, 14-year-old Rod Mathews beat a classmate to death with a bat in the woods near his home in Canton, Massachusetts. He had been prescribed Ritalin since the third grade. 35    (3) William Cruse was charged with killing six people in a shooting rampage on April 23, 1987, in Palm Bay, Florida. Cruse had been seeing a Kentucky psychiatrist and stated he had been taking psychiatric drugs for several years. 36    (4) Bartley Dobben killed his two young children on November 26, 1987, by casting them in a 1,300 degree foundry ladle. He had been placed on a regimen of psychiatric drugs in 1985. 37    (5) On May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann walked into a Winnetka, Illinois second grade classroom carrying three pistols and began shooting innocent little children, killing one and wounding five others before killing herself. Subsequent blood tests revealed that both Lithium and the antidepressant Anafranil were in her bloodstream at the time the murder was committed.38    (6) On September 26, 1988, 19-year-old James Wilson took a .22 caliber revolver into an elementary school in Greenwood, South Carolina, and started shooting schoolchildren, killing two 8-year-old girls and wounding seven other children and two teachers. Wilson had been in and out of the hands of psychiatrists for years and within eight months of the killings he had been on several psychiatric drugs which can generate violent behavior. Since the age of 14 he had been given psychiatric drugs, including Xanax, Valium, Thorazine and Haldol. 39    (7) On January 17, 1989, Patrick Purdy opened fire on a school yard full of young children in Stockton, California. During his vicious and unprovoked assault, Purdy killed five schoolchildren and wounded thirty others before killing himself. During the two years prior to the murders of the Stockton children, Purdy had been on two strong psychiatric drugs of categories known to cause violence. 40    (8) On April 28, 1992, Kenneth Seguin drugged his two children, aged 7 and 5, took them to a pond, slashed their wrists and dumped their bodies in the water. He then drove home and killed his wife with an ax while she slept. He was on Prozac at the time. 41    (9) In November 1992, Lynwood Drake III, in San Luis Obisbo and Morro Bay, California, shot and killed six people with a hand gun before he killed himself. Metabolized Prozac and Valium were both found in his system. 42    (10) In December 1993, Steven Leith of Chelsea, Michigan, walked back into a school meeting and fatally shot the school superintendent and wounded two others including a fellow teacher. He was on Prozac at the time of the shootings. 1343>    (11) Sixteen-year-old Brian Pruitt, who fatally stabbed his grandparents in 1995, had a history of psychiatric treatment and had been prescribed psychiatric drugs. 44    (12) On November 3, 1995, Sergeant Steven B. Christian, a twenty-five-year commended veteran of the Dallas police force drove to a police sub-station and seriously wounded an officer outside in his attempt to get inside and shoot others. Christian was shot and killed by two fellow Dallas police officers. The autopsy revealed high levels of an antidepressant in his blood. 45    (13) In Connecticut on March 6, 1998, Mathew Beck, a lottery accountant, reported promptly to his job, hung up his coat and methodically gunned down four of his bosses, one of whom he chased through a parking lot before he turned
