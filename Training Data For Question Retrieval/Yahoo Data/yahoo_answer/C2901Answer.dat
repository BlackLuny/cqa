There is a trend right now for people to start growing more veggies as part of their regular landscaping, and I think this is terrific too. We live out in the country and have 6 tillable acres. Most of which is in hay right now to feed our 4 mules. We are fighting a thistle problem in our small greens garden, because some dimwit neighbor plowed up a stretch of dirt by the lane for a snow break, and then did not planet a cover crop the following year, and thistles got in.Thistles must be from the dinosaur days because their reproduction properties are over the top. They more U try to eradicate them, the faster they multiply. If U cut them up with plow or how, they sprout double time. If U burn them they pop up somewhere else. They are amazing. The only way we have found to control them so far is to smoother them with black construction plastic and "cook" them with the sun's heat all summer long.    Back to the White House -- do the cooks there grow any herbs already? That would be a great reason to start a garden right there. Keep your idea going ~~ this just may not be the right time yet.

68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Denier is meant to be pejorative.   It is used to compare those who doubt that CO2 is driving the climate to holocaust deniers.  I think all true conservatives are libertarians.  Modern libertarians run from conservative to leftists.  I consider myself a libertarian as well but I am a conservative.      By the way, I called Dana a denier and he reported my answer twice and suggested it was insulting.  I agree with him that it is insulting.  Cosequently, I think everyone should do unto Dana as he does to others and when he insults people by comparing them to holocaust deniers, he should be reported as such.    Note:Flavian and JS are classic examples of where a little bit of knowlede is a dangerous thing.  JS is convinced there is a conspiracy around every door.  He thinks I am skeptical that CO2 doesn't drive climate because as a geologist I must be corrupt and take money from the oil industry.  I am a skeptic as most geologist are, because we learn geologic history.  Talk about insulting.  Geesh.    Flavian thinks the recent warming doesn't fit within the Milankovitch cycle.  Wow.  There are other things that affect the climate.  The recent changes have been miniscule when compared to past changes that were almost certainly due to the Milankovitch cycle.   As with most alarmists, they think that if they can't come up with an answer, they smuggly conclude the answer must be that man is causing it.  Anyone doubting that is a denier.    If you think all people should be treated equally and oppose affirmative action, you are labled a bigot by the far left.    If you think people should only move to our country legally, you are called a racist by the far left.    If you think it is abhorent to suck the brains out of a late term baby so that it can be aborted, you are labled as anti-woman.     If you are skeptical of their wacko claims that geologic history must be ignored, and  for the first time, CO2 is driving the climate, you are labeled a DENIER.      I personally think political correctness stems from juvenile mentality that can't win arguments in the real world so resort to name calling.    Dana says: Everyone should be, just like you should be skeptical of any scientific theory (including evolution). But once you start denying facts and clearly established science, that makes you a denier.    So clearly Dana is a denier. He denies geologic history.  To make it clear to people like JS, geologic history means history of the earth.  Clearly there is nothing in the recent history that isn't consistent with the geologic past.  You can create computer models that say anything you want but they are simply models with more assumptions than facts.  That is all alarmists have.   Alarmsts can't get around this inconvenient fact.   They are deniers of reality and actual earth science.|`|AsKWImpQaa	No, not at all.   You're describing a skeptic, but many of the people on YA are anti-scientists.  They do not believe science or trust scientists.  They call AGW a liberal hoax.  Anyone that calls the work of thousands of independent scientists a "hoax" (one went so far as to compare it to Piltdown Man) is an anti-scientist, and certainly not a skeptic.     I don't think "denier" is any more pejorative than "believer," but if they don't like being called deniers I'm happy to call them anti-scientists.  True skeptics are skeptical, not deluded into believing vast conspiracies.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Depends on what you would accept as proof or fact.   If you refuse to believe any so called proof no matter what, then yes, it's a retively accurate term.   There is no denying that CO2 blocks heat from escaping.   Would you accept that as proof or a fact?|`|0eFSeap5aa	It's a ridiculous term.  It's the fearful mockery by people who are watching their religion being debunked before their eyes.  When someone tells you we have the answers, the science is in, dana master of science, or whatever, you can be sure they are slinging bull and want to silence any debate before it blows up in their face.  This whole thing is mind numbingly ludicrous.|`|eJgEYi8Waa	"Skeptic" might be more general.  "Conservative" might be more political.|`|53VgQm9Caa	Surprisingly many things we accept as scientific fact have not been "proven" beyond all possible doubt, as such.     The link between smoking and cancer for instance has not been proven - just ask the Heartland Institute. But there is overwhelming statistical evidence to support the proposition that smoking causes cancer.    The big piece of evidence in favour of anthropogenic climate change, as far as I'm concerned, is that there's no alternative theory to explain modern global warming. It's a matter of applying Occam's Razor.       For instance, we know that it doesn't correlate  with solar output or sunspots. We know it doesn't correlate volcanic activity. We know it doesn't correlate with geological events. We know it doesn't correlate with the Milankovitch Cycles.    About the only thing it does correlate with, is a build up in the atmosphere's content of man made CO2.    http://www.mps.mpg.de/images/projekte/su...  http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Climat...    Eliminate the impossible, and what's left?|`|uFQFRdczaa	Skeptic is definitely a better term.  Or agnostic, to borrow a term from religious debates.  Some people on both sides of this issue seem to take it to a level of religious faith.    Anthropogenic global warming is a theory, and theories (like gravitation, evolution, etc.) can't be proved.  Ever.  Some theories have evidence that supports them, others do not.  When enough evidence contradicts a theory (as with Geocentrism), scientists will try to come up with a new explanation for why things work the way they do.  When a new explanation fits all of the known facts better, it becomes an accepted theory.      Of course, some people still cling to theories like Flat Earth, Geocentrism, and Creationism that the rest of us have discarded.  "Denier" would be the proper term for those.|`|4090lGkMaa	At the risk of offending someone I agree with, I do not believe so. I would use the skeptic label for one such as you. But then again, one must understand that theories can never be proved, scientifically speaking. So, one must ask themselves, am I blocking or hindering action on an issue when I think the issue might be real?|`|vfubWXFMaa	For some who thinks it might be true but wants proof the correct term would be heretic, skeptics know there is no such thing as AGW and realize that what minor warming we have had is the mildest recovery from a cold period in the history of the current holocene interglacial period. every previous climate change has occurred faster and got much hotter in that faster period. Most skeptics I know outside of answers really do not think the little ice age has ended at all and we are only in a short mild period as occurred in 1400, 1600 and 1800. If so we could drop back to ice age conditions as have happened regularly over the last 800 years since the MWP ended in the 13th century.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	That's not the correct criterion.  There are both skeptics and deniers who think AGW has not been sufficiently proven.    The difference between the two is that deniers reject clear-cut science.  For example, they deny the difference between weather and climate.  Or they deny that the surface temperature record is valid.  Or they deny that the Sun has been conclusively ruled out as the cause for the recent warming.    It's fine to be skeptical of AGW.  Everyone should be, just like you should be skeptical of any scientific theory (including evolution).  But once you start denying facts and clearly established science, that makes you a denier.|`|f64a2a4ada0fcb1ea5303362c0bca8efaa	No it is not accurate.  The use of the word denier is a paradox on itself.  People present arguments as to why they believe global warming is a real threat. Then you hear from a group of other experts that do not believe it is a threat.  So it boils down to, who do you trust?  The group of people who support global warming also use tactics that make them untrustworthy.   One of these tactics is using the word denier. The do that because they cannot attack what was said, so they attack who said it, and question his motives.   So the more they use the word denier, the more mistrustful you become of what they say and so on.    But if anybody is a denier, it would have to be the people who support the theory.  Anybody who believes that we can have seven years of cooling, and still be adamant that their theory is correct is a denier of the facts, whereas, opponents are deniers of theoretical models, that are not supported by the data.|`|SIWh4UCyaa	sorry but I use the word "denier" in it's actual English meaning  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/d...    It doesn't mention nazi's anywhere (jim), in the definition what it says is  noun  a person who denies.  n.   One that denies: a denier of harsh realities.     Seems to fit to me|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	Theories are not "proven".  Wating for "proof" would be to wait for us to be able to look back in hindsight and see the warming and damage that appeared in the past, and we can see from deiners' actions today that they even deny past data and outcomes!    The mental gymnastics required to ignore observed warming with a sound scientific basis rooted in basic physics and observatrions of nearby planets can only come from living in a profound state of psychological denial.  It's an entirely normal human reaction to perceived threats, and to being in a mental state of cognitive dissonance.    The term also fits due to the information they use, coming from well documented (through ExxonMobil's required public disclosures for example) paid advocates whose job it is to deny the presence or seriousness of global warming.  Some of the players were even central to the similar efforts by the tobacco industry to deny the harmful effects of smoking!  ExxonMobil even appologizes on an annual basis and promises to cut funding!  Could their game plan to deceive us be any more open and obvious (or obnoxious)?  Why would anyone, other than geologists employed in their industry, fall in line with their blatant propaganda?    So yes, I think it's not just accurate, it's far more appropriate than generously labeling them "skeptics" when they don't treat the unsupported denial theories with any remote trace of skepticism at all!    They can't seem to discern between science and fictional arm-waving.  What's up with that?    They even pat themselves on the back for claiming that there's some sort of intricate global plot that accounts for the scientific record being 1000 to 0 in favor of AGW theory.  Given that behavior, perhaps it should most accurately be labelled "irrational paranoic denial".|`|UgTHAsISaa	No. Nothing in science can be "proven". If you are waiting for the greenhouse effect, evolution, gravity, buoyancy, etc... to be "proven", then you'll be waiting until the cows come home. A denier is someone who denies science just for the sake of delaying any appropriate action.    A skeptic is someone who is critically thinks about scientific arguments. In order to do this, they must understand the science. Most of the deniers on Yahoo! Answers are scientifically illiterate. A skeptic would understand that nothing in science can be "proven"; a denier does not.|`|t1zlbOURaa	No. It's a designed specifically to silence discussion. Kind of like pinning the term "racist" on someone.    I think I'm going to start reporting it's use.|`|bRfLyvPIaa	Apparently.    Also, I'm pretty liberal (what used to be called moderate in pre-Reagan America), but the arguments of the alarmists have not convinced me. I'm not convinced they're wrong, but I'm a long way from convinced they're right. So that makes me a "denier," I guess.     What worries me is that global warming alarmism has become so associated with liberalism in America that if they wind up being wrong their error (coupled with the fervor with which they argue their position) will taint even the most common-sense and demonstrably true liberal positions. That would be a big win for the conservatives, and our society can't take too much more conservatism.
arivclSSaa	I think it really depends on the population. Lake Chad dried up because of human overuse and global warming, it took about 60 years for it to dry almost to nothing.

A more positive approach would be to grab pen and paper and write an real letter to as many officials as possible. Also calling in person to offices of elected officials is more effective.

G7vtb0Yxaa	possibly.. we we will see but i hope not|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	Please provide evidence of those supposed droughts.    The Ancient Pueblans (sometimes incorrectly referred to as Anasazi) are believed to have been the victims of a complex set of factors including overuse and depletion of the land's carrying capacity, much like the Mayans:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_May...  "The Maya people did not actually disappear during the Classic Maya Collapse, and the entire Maya region did not collapse. Most of the southern Maya centers declined and were abandoned, while a few cities with access to water continued through this transitional period, and still other new ones were founded.   Current theories of the Classic Maya Collapse have been categorized into three models:  - systemic ecological collapse  the Maya over-exploited the land and caused environmental problems for themselves;   - political/warfare  a cultural theory holding that the elite fought too much and provided poor leadership; and   - drought caused by climate change."    Short term weather events such as a short, moderate drought certainly could have played a role with other factors in pushing them over the edge, as happened during the Dust Bowl times in more recent history:  http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/mill...    So people leaving the place is not sufficient evidence of a long term drought.  What evidence is there of any major or long term drought events in that area?    I've been travelling a lot in the Southern Utah. Southern Colorado and Northern Arizona area, particularly during the last 4 years, exploring the ruins, and the story is certainly a fascinating one.    So help me with this too... why do the same people often propose a 12th century drought with absolute certainty (with minimal if any data) or even claim that the Medeival Warm Period reqional temperatures in Europe were warmer than today (scientists say it wasn't warmer, and there's no convincing evidence that it was global), yet doubt the scientific data coming form thousands of weather stations over the past 50-100 years?  Why are there two standards for what is considered reliable data to use in making a point?  Isn't that a sign that someone isn't thinking very logically or clearly (possibly the folks embracing the unreliable data)?    Regardless of whether the challenges faced in the 12th century in the Southwest were primarily precipitated by land overuse and fertility depletion or drought, we're about 100 years into an accelerating warming trend that is forecast to warm 2-10X more in the next 100 years.  Have you seen a single source that claims that 12th century, or 15th century (Medeival Warm Period), or any century for any human civilization in any region of the globe, was even 2 degrees warmer, let alone as much as 9 degrees warmer?    So I'd have to say yes, the forecasts are for much greater warming than any known point for human civilization in the past, so droughts in the Southwest are likely to surpass any ever see by humans in that area (during the past 50-100+ centuries, not just the 12th century).    If the region couldn't support a few thousand Ancient Pueblans who were accustomed to living in the harsh desert environment, how will it support tens of millions when our taps run dry and the heat becomes unbearable for crops?

l9VOEQ2Faa	buena pregunta te la respndo.                                            Vidrio sustancia amorfa fabricada sobre todo a partir de slice (SiO2) fundida a altas temperaturas con boratos o fosfatos. Tambin se encuentra en la naturaleza, por ejemplo en la obsidiana, un material volcnico, o en los enigmticos objetos conocidos como tectitas. El vidrio es una sustancia amorfa porque no es ni un slido ni un lquido, sino que se halla en un estado vtreo en el que las unidades moleculares, aunque estn dispuestas de forma desordenada, tienen suficiente cohesin para presentar rigidez mecnica. El vidrio se enfra hasta solidificarse sin que se produzca cristalizacin; el calentamiento puede devolverle su forma lquida. Suele ser transparente, pero tambin puede ser traslcido u opaco. Su color vara segn los ingredientes empleados en su fabricacin.    El vidrio fundido es maleable y se le puede dar forma mediante diversas tcnicas. En fro, puede ser tallado. A bajas temperaturas es quebradizo y se rompe con fractura concoidea (en forma de concha de mar).    Se fabric por primera vez antes del 2000 a.C., y desde entonces se ha empleado para fabricar recipientes de uso domstico as como objetos decorativos y ornamentales, entre ellos joyas. (En este artculo trataremos cualquier vidrio con caractersticas comercialmente tiles en cuanto a trasparencia, ndice de refraccin, color.    ademas   El vidrio se fabrica a partir de una mezcla compleja de compuestos vitrificantes, como slice, fundentes, como los lcalis, y estabilizantes, como la cal. Estas materias primas se cargan en el horno de cubeta (de produccin continua) por medio de una tolva. El horno se calienta con quemadores de gas o petrleo. La llama debe alcanzar una temperatura suficiente, y para ello el aire de combustin se calienta en unos recuperadores construidos con ladrillos refractarios antes de que llegue a los quemadores. El horno tiene dos recuperadores cuyas funciones cambian cada veinte minutos: uno se calienta por contacto con los gases ardientes mientras el otro proporciona el calor acumulado al aire de combustin. La mezcla se funde (zona de fusin) a unos 1.500 C y avanza hacia la zona de enfriamiento, donde tiene lugar el recocido. En el otro extremo del horno se alcanza una temperatura de 1.200 a 800 C. Al vidrio as obtenido se le da forma por laminacin o por otro mtodo.     Materiales y tcnicas.-   El ingrediente principal del vidrio es la slice, obtenida a partir de arena, pedernal o cuarzo.|`|d3bacaec6733ef943315aac04ccf2d05aa	Se silicio, y este es arena refina y carburada a altos grados de temperatura, hasta llegar a un estado que se ocnvierte posteriormente en vidrio.|`|4390NW0Naa	EL VIDRIO ESTA ECHO DE CRISTAL ESTUPIDA|`|IZ12Wo07aa	PUES CRISTAL     UN SALUDO|`|VrZzQf6oaa	Hasta donde yo se y es muy poco el vidrio esta hecho de arena y otras cosillas...|`|mYEi99shaa	esta hecho de silicio puro y es un recurso no renovable que nunca se va a regresar a la naturaleza.

That global warming was a farce dreamed up by Al Gore.  It's a con job.|`|vfubWXFMaa	In all the testing I have done co2 would have to reach 10% or more of the atmosphere to achieve even close to the same effect that 50% relative humidity has. Co2 at 4000 ppm or lower has virtually no heat retention value at all. The tests that were used to label co2 as a green house gas used containers with 100% co2 against normal air.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	From just CO2 alone the warming "in the pipeline" is 0.5C from the carbon we've already emitted.  The science behind this is that we've emitted CO2 so rapidly that the climate system isn't in equilbrium and the oceans haven't had time to warm up yet.    However, there are other feedbacks when you increase CO2, such as water vapor (another greenhouse gas) also increasing.  So I believe the total expected warming "in the pipeline" is 2C.    See the link below for a more scientific explanation, particularly Step 6.|`|sSvPEf97aa	There's about a 50% chance that the Earth would warm, however if no changes occurred to greenhouse gases then there's about a 50% chance that the Earth would start to cool.    The only think we know 100% is that there is a 0% chance that the climate would be static and never change one way or the other.

We live in a cheap-skate society run by cheap-skate politicians elected by a cheap-skate populace.  You get what you pay for.

I38WF5aFaa	I am outraged that the government takes money from me to give to someone else.  LIHEAP and all the rest of the welfare programs need to be scaled back by at least 85%.  Make the recipients work for their benefits.  Make them work the equivalent of less than minimum wage and McDonalds will look like a good job.  I am not refrring to people who are truly disabled.  Most of the people who sponge off the taxpayers are capable of holding a job.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Sure, let them freeze to death. Maybe that will drop your taxes a whole dollar per year.    LIHEAP, at least in my area, promotes conservation. There are inspections, weatherproofing, distribution of CFLs, and monitoring to determine whether the home is using more energy than expected for its size.|`|1c264470699c75f9ef21a75b4682539eaa	Ultimately, liheap is not a part of the solution,but, it is a desperately needed program. American society,as of late,is but a mish-mash of exxagerations-one way or the other. I like to believe that we are only as good, as how we treat our most vulnerable. On this front, we are failing morally. It is only a matter of time before we all fail,and, begin to suffer, the consequences of our actions.
SRG5YDAAaa	Robin Leach and John Ascuaga do hotel ratings, often in some form of disguise.  They test out the continental breakfasts, water pressure, heaters, air conditioning, beds, TP, towels, soap, complimentary shampoo, mini bars, lighting, TVs, on demand movies, parking, pools, weight rooms, laundry, ice machines, game rooms, room service, and check in protocols.  Sometimes they even test the elevators.
AA11264399	Warmth and precipitation, I would think.|`|US7QRadjaa	because there are specific climatic inputs and they influence the soil and vegetation growth.The climatic inputs include the sunlight,temperature and rainfall,they are correlated  and influense each other.                        Sunlight gives a strong insolation in tropical is an important factor to the remaining factors.Tropical rainforest locates between10 XN to 10XS.Because the angle of insolation is high throughout the whole year ,so it can receive a strong and intense insolation  in the whole year .So the temperature of tropical rainforest is constantly high and there is no extreme climate. They can receive enough sunlight, have photosynthesis to get a high vegetation productivity.                        Temperature influenced by sunlight determines the growth of plants.When there is extreme weather condition,that means the annual range and daily range of temperature is very high,the growing season becomes short,vegetation easily wilts.But in tropical rainforests,the constant sunlight gives a moderate climate.This environment favours vegetation growth in the whole year and there is lack of seasonality.                        The amount of precipitation also influence the vegetation growth.In the tropics,because of the intense heat brought by the sunlight,hot air rises rapidly and cool down.Relative humidity rises and air condenses to form rain clouds,so there are convection rains regularly and the annual rainfall is above 2500mm.As a result,there is enough moisture to support plants growth and favours photosynthesis.The vegetation productivity becomes high.|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	More plant life per sq. foot thus exchanging the most CO2 in O per sq. foot.

Low acid foods have to be canned using a pressure cooker, but it can still be done in the home. I've been canning fruits and jams for years, I believe the shelf life of most things is 2 years.
dj00wdjKaa	There has always been a fear of over populating the planet. It's true that the number of births outgrow the number of deaths. And it seems we now have 6.75 billion people. But the rate of births and deaths have many variables. Take Brazil's middle class, for example. Three generations ago it was normal for couples to have on average 20 kids. Then when their kids became parents the average number of kids per couple was around 5. In this present generation the average is 2 to 3 kids per family. So the more a country develops the less kids they have. In the 1960 the birth rate around the world was higher than it is now. In very developed countries such as Europe they are trying to encourage people to have more kids cause the number of elder outgrow the number of young people. So the tendency is for developed countries to stabilize growth because they do the fertility control on their own.   Then there are the poor countries or societies. They have a huge amount of kids because many die young (wars and disease) so they have to have many children to guarantee that their family tree survives. Either that or the female thinks she is obliged to have kids no matter how many. Whatever the reason, if poor countries developed, I believe their population would shrink a lot cause their fertility and mortality rate would drop and their life expectancy would rise and stabilize like in the developed countries. I see poverty as a the cause of overpopulation, not overpopulation as a cause of poverty.   As to wars, if they were a direct cause of overpopulation then India and Japan would be in severe civil unrest by now. Besides, tribal wars happened long ago when there was plenty of land for everyone. War affects population growth but I don't believe it's caused by it. They happen for political and economic reasons. Europe has learned ever since the European Coal and Steel Community that economic cooperation is much better than waging wars. And it's been prooven that there are enough resourses for everyone in the world. We just have to use it in a responsible manner.

A EGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1    As people we are so insecure and are uncomfortable with not knowing, so the ego asks the question "What is the answer to life?"  So then the ego cannot get it's answer so it iin vets rediculis ideas like Gods, religion, communication with the other side and the after life.    People need to deal with WHAT IS, not with what should be or might be as this is not reality.  Reality and true living is living with what actually is, not what should be.    People who are concerned with this question or in death, they are not really living here and now.  Part of them is looking way in the future or in the past, not really giving their all attention to living in the glorious moment.

The concept can be expressed through a variety of related questions, such as Why are we here?, What's life all about? and What is the meaning of it all?. It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific, and theological speculation throughout history and there have been a large number of answers from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.|`|aBCVFc3Kaa	What people don't seem to realise is that Douglas Adams has a valid point- not that the answer is 42, but in the fact that people ponder over a meaning that will never come but don't stop to think: "What is the ultimate question?" Do you mean: Why are we here? How did we get here? or maybe What do we have to do in the meantime? The truth is, life is meaningless. If you look up the Big Bang you will find that from that point in history the whole of existence is just one huge coincidence. Our solar system is just a random pool full of rocks and gas clouds, and our own planet's history is just generation after generation of life forms, mutated through natural selection, struggling to survive on a planet with a natural disaster around every corner. And as for the existence of humans- no offence meant to any religion by the way- we are but a fraction of a fraction recurring in the vast expanses of the accidental universe.     The fact that our whole existence is based on a chain of events starting from a clash of particles to a group of mutant monkeys may be a depressing thought to many people, but it is true and has been proved- unlike all religions- and, although it may be depressing, the only thing that you can do is to make the most of your life and fulfil your dreams as best as you can.      I hope you work it out in the end, good luck.
