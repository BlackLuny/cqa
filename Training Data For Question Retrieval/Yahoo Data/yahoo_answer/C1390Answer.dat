xGb2CBgkaa	If the government has a government budget deficit of 300 billion, it means it is spending 300 billion more than it is taking in thru taxes.<br>  <br>  That means the government tax collected is 1,700 billion (1.7 trillion).  <br>  <br>  Regarding your formula above, <br>  <br>  T - g = public saving  -->  it means....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Taxes collected - Government spending = public savings <br>  <br>  If the government collects more tax money than it spends, the public savings is positive and it is also called a budget surplus.<br>  <br>  If government collects less tax money than it spends, then the public savings is negative and it it also called a budget deficit.<br>  <br>  By the way, "public savings" is really government savings or government investment.<br>  <br>  A budget deficit is when "public savings" is negative.
mOXOfDdRaa	Believing in myself and not needing anyone else to do it for me|`|kGiwteWgaa	a lot of it has to do with personal thoughts about yourself: if you think you look good, think your smart etc. It's actually a proven fact that girls gain alot of confidence by what they are wearing. <br>  it also can have to do with your social status, how much money you have, if you have authority of anyone, if people think your funny etc. <br>  as you can see it all depends and it changes for everyone.|`|E9r7jOSZaa	I somewhat agree with Madeline...confidence for me also has a deeper meaning when it comes to my personal & work life. <br>  For me it is also about my thought process, my EQ, how I interact with my friends, colleagues & seniors and over all how people perceive me in my immediate environment. <br>  Dressing up well & smelling good does boost our over all confidence, but if, one is not confident from within, then its futile.<br>  For me, my self belief is the biggest confidence booster of all.

JgFkmif9aa	It depends on what you mean by genuine democracy.  If your talking about the US, we are not a genuine democracy and we never have been or were supposed to be (look into the writings of Madison and Jefferson on the differences between a democracy and a republic).<br>  <br>  Now, if you are of the mind that we ought to be a completely democratic nation, I would not consider a wide range of incomes a liability in that situation.  Assuming this hypothetical government is a true democracy, then it is fair to assume that each person has equal rights to vote.  To say that wealth must be redistributed in order to archive democracy is to say that the poor deserve extra consideration by the government, or in other words have greater rights than the rest of society.  This is contrary to pure democracy.

I included a brief excerpt of the Ptolemy family from the link below.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra</a><br>  "Though she bore the ancient Egyptian title Pharaoh, her main language was Greek; for several centuries preceding her rule, Egyptian kings had been of Macedonian (i.e. Hellenistic) origin rather than Egyptian origin. The establishment of a Greek-speaking aristocracy in Egypt had come with Alexander the Great nearly 300 years before. Cleopatra is reputed to have been the first member of her family in their 300-year reign in Egypt to have learned the Egyptian language. Cleopatra adopted common Egyptian beliefs and deities. Her patron goddess was Isis, and thus during her reign it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom."<br>  Several years ago the DNA of Ramsees II was tested & the Y chromosome was Haplogroup E (EV13 I think, with MtDNA of H(?)). Since that time the Egyptians have refused to release any further DNA testing on Egyptian mummies, or allow Europeans access to information on testing.  The link indicating his Mt DNA was of North European extraction has disappeared (I don't know if it was correct or not, but I remember it as being from a reliable academic source). Sorry I can't remember which version of haplogroup H the Mt DNA came from.<br>  Anyway, Ev13 is closely associated with Haplogroup J (a major Jewish haplogroup) and one might suspect this would embarress the government. I'd love to get my hands on the results of those DNA tests on Pharohs, but the Egyptian government and department of antiquity refuses to release them.<br>  I sure hope my memory is correct on those DNA tests & I hope I've given you the right information on Ramsees.<br>  To make a long story short: Egyptians claim that the DNA testing is too unreliable for public release, but make claims of having established the relationship of people found in tombs.<br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-08-06-3105984364_x.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-...</a>
HMzsm50vaa	Well your question is kinda hard for me to understand, but I will tell you that there are many people who for example, don't like themselves for whatever reason (their looks, their success, their money, their failures, having a bad hair day, etc) so what they will do is try to turn it around and make you feel bad about yourself, so that they can feel better.  It's like they are taking their anger out "at your expense" to feel better about themselves or to make up for whatever they are upset about lacking---like my examples above.<br>  And this goes for anyone...men to men, men to women, women to men, women to women.<br>  There are so many things that you will discover about people, and the older you get the more you discover, but the wiser you will be about it as in you will understand what is going on at that moment so you won't get your feelings hurt or upset about it....you'll just go with the flow, or "kill em with kindness"<br>  Also with people like this, if you are too open or show any type of weakness that you may have, they will prey upon that, but on the other hand, same goes for your strengths as well.|`|AA11952133	Some people are just jerks and they seem to congregate here on Yahoo so just scroll past them!  <br>  <br>  As far as people trying to make you doubt yourself, don't.

3c77be701ff8c92a4a1c30595d024c49aa	Many of the characteristics that you describe yourself having are also characteristics of psychopaths. Superficially charming, pathological lying, lack of remorse, grandiosity, irresponsibility, impulsive behavior,  and the stealing is indicative of antisocial personality disorder and possibly need for stimulation/prone to boredom. There's really no treatment. Eventually this behavior will escalate until you get caught and spend time in jail.|`|Ewosh9pTaa	Sociopath would be the definition you are after. But i don't think you are. I was the same when I was 17. And the reason i was that way, was because I actually had NO confidence AT ALL. I put out a front and played a role, building a wall of lies around me, so that no-one could hurt me because no-one could ever get at the REAL ME!<br>  If you feel you are tricking people then it gives you a sense of power and control. You say that you almost have anxiety if you are forced to tell the truth? This is because you are scared that if the TRUE you is discovered you will be humiliated, because the real you is unlovable.<br>  But this is not true.<br>  In time you will come to realise that being yourself is what makes you lovable - the cold front is a shield. "Emotional Blunting".|`|V5CsAF3gaa	I think you're just over exaggerating, every teenage girl does it. Trust me, almost every girl in my jr high.

Otherwise you would not feel you have to lie to people to make them like or accept you.  When you began to feel more secure about yourself, maybe you will find it easier to be honest.  <br>  Then again, maybe you have a problem trusting people...if this is true, honesty will be hard for you.  But, if you aren't careful you will begin lying to yourself, and that's when you are in real trouble.<br>  <br>  Still, that being said, if you really want to quit, try doing it slowly.  Make a goal to slowly tell less lies a day.  I know a girl who is down to one lie a day per person.  <br>  <br>  And if you are aware of what you are doing...then you are right in the head.|`|HYbYkcPPaa	Your second sentence says it all - you have a very high opinion of yourself.  My guess is that you feel smarter, and therefore better, than everyone else because you get away with so much (at least you think you do).<br>  <br>  I'd say that you're an egomaniac, and if you have no remorse for anything you do, then you're displaying sociopathic qualities.  <br>  <br>  That said, you're only 17, and when enough of this stuff comes back to bite you in the *** (and it will) you'll figure it out.|`|a9bb4ee4324503197ef00de7893da3dcaa	a person can be pretty, charming, intelligent and possess all the great qualities you say you have and still be insecure. you seem to be making up for that in the way that you behave. also you have come to realize you can control just about any given situation by lying and acting so the control itself can be addictive. you do sound as if you suffer from some depression. the problem is is that you are 17 so the things you lie about and get away with are simple. the older you get and the more complicated life gets the more susceptible to exposure your lies will be....meaning you will eventually get caught and once you do sh*ts gonna suck because once you are labeled a liar it's an impossible label to get rid of. <br>  <br>  you do seem as if you want to change and are not happy living this way. while lying and manipulation have worked for you and it brings you instant gratification, the satisfaction is short lived. the only way to get over this is to see a psychologist and tell them exactly what you do. you don't have to worry about them ratting you out or telling your parents. you won't get in trouble but you will get help. you do seem intelligent so you do know that this needs to change. i recommend acting on it as soon as possible because it's going to get out of control really fast and then you'll be in a huge mess.|`|uyRf8HyCaa	I dont actually think your just being a jerk because you posted this question, therefore deep down you might know that your actions are kinda mean! If you cant help but to lie in person, which is common is some people, then get a notebook and write down basically everything you typed above! If you cant speak the truth, then write the truth!! Turn this into your therapist and then they can actualy elp you because they will be able to know your real problems, not made up ones. They will guide you from there, and goood luck! :)
AA11952133	EVERY woman goes through periods where they feel "Un-pretty" it's okay.  I'm sure you are not as unattractive as you believe you are.  But, if you want to do some things to make yourself more attractive to YOU, here are a few ideas.<br>  <br>  1)  Exercises.  Whether you are fat or not exercise is perfect because it releases feel good endorphins and you will feel better before you know it.<br>  <br>  2)Try a new hairstyle or hair color.  Even a subtle change can make a big difference.<br>  <br>  3) DO NOT look at other people and compare yourself to them.  If you do that you will never measure up and it will just make you feel worse.<br>  <br>  4)  Save up some money and buy yourself something special.  (You deserve it!)   If you treat yourself well, you will begin to feel well.<br>  <br>  5) Even if you look at yourself in the mirror and believe you don't have any assets, YOU DO!  So as soon as you read this go to a mirror and find ONE thing you think isn't that bad, and focus on that!  And say out loud that you like your......  (whatever you find)<br>  <br>  These are the things I did so I know they work!|`|mFmVOlgwaa	Just remember that somewhere out there in the world, even if it doesn't feel like it, someone is having it worse than you. Look yourself in the mirror and say I'm pretty! Look at yourself, is there something truly wrong that is another situation that affects and is the outcome of why you feel bad now. Is there something really wrong with you? The only way to tell is if other people notice it to and say it, otherwise your just being paranoid.|`|e45NUJZ7aa	You should look into doing Positive Affirmations, Positive Affirmations will help you to change those negative self defeating thoughts to positive thoughts, in the beginning it might seem like a lie, but the more and more you do it on a daily basis you will begin to see who you really are within.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	It sounds cliche but everyone feels like this at some time or another, but some people just feel it more. More often than not people make themselves feel even worse by believing they are the only ones that feel this way, but trust me, you're not. You need to be pro-active; have a new haircut, treat yourself to a new outfit, ask your friends to give you a girly makeover and then go out somewhere. You need to train yourself to remember that you are beautiful. And whatever you do, don't focus on girls in the magazines - even THEY don't really look like that. Good luck!|`|Ewosh9pTaa	Do activities that stop you looking inwards. <br>  Example: go for a walk with a friend or play a game of tennis. After 20 minutes you'll realise that you've forgotten about half your issues. Over analysis and over-thinking is the enemy. <br>  My advice is this "DJ BOLT!"<br>  DJ = Don't Judge others.<br>  B = Be yourself<br>  O = Open emotionally to others.<br>  L = Love yoursself<br>  T = Trust in a higher force (god) that everything will be alright.

AA10167568	Your going through what many people go through in life.  The question of why we are here and what is the point of our life.  Unfortunately from all the books that I have read on the topic such as The Myth of Sisyphus (book on life vs. death), Man's Search for Meaning (Frankl), etc. the answer comes up the same -it can be blunt and curt.  <br>  <br>  There is no point, no overall and end all answer, we merely exist very likely from some random concoction of cosmic soup and it is ultimately up to us to create our own meaning in our lives.  We can choose to be sad, happy, busy, lonely, in love etc it is all how we view our lives and the people around us.  No one is going to do it for us.  Our lives are strictly our lives - our actions determine our results.  We are behind the steering wheel and determine our destination.<br>  <br>  I think a good book for you to read is the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle or any books by him.  He was in a similar state as you mentioned when pursuing his doctorate, but found he wasn't happy, so he became a spiritual teacher.  The teachings are not that religious or manipulative.  They mainly center around "the past is dead, the only thing that exists is the present moment", some time our thoughts defeat us so stay proactive and avoid thinking too much, and if we lower the volume on our own thoughts we can hear all the beautiful things we miss going on in the world.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, focus only on the good things, try new things,  and be patient as you have your whole life to find the answers you seek for yourself|`|C1imDsmbaa	try out being a nun. dont think of the stereotypical ones, because there are some cool nuns out there, believe me. and if you dont like being in a convent, its ok, you dont have to stay. they dont push you to do anything. if you have no desire to kiss a guy thats fine. really. dont get so worked up about yourself, God is there. :]|`|GaWf0z1Faa	hjdnfhdfjdfjd !<br>  <br>  yu  neeeeed tooooo kno thaa' yu neeed tooo beee  SAVEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD<br>  BYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br>  JESUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS|`|JGppUccmaa	Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior!|`|YD4h2zgqaa	get some weed.... it works for me <br>  lol ( ;|`|52otNiElaa	Get religious, You find out got has a purpose for everything and if your goals and his goals don't equal you don't feel inner peace.|`|1Txef261aa	Go Backpacking around the world and discover new things.|`|4xN3ZIhYaa	people who are very involved in the world with fast fast paced schedules (religion, family, friends,  job, school) seem more upbeat and outgoing.<br>   <br>  you sound like a loner. as a result you have much more time to reflect and have introspective thought.  i bet you notice things other people don't  and are more analytical than most.<br>  <br>  i think its a result of isolation many times that loners get because they are operating outside of social interaction|`|jbJvTUfPaa	Get the book "Homecoming" by John Bradshaw and sit down and read it - digest it - do the exercises in it - you will benefit from it - and it'll show you how to make peace with yourself, the inner child, as he calls it - it works!|`|tiCO7mXuaa	Read your bible and develope a relationship with God.

Everyone messes up and when your a viewer you dont even catch it, so no one would notice if you made a mistake! For example watch President Obama's swearing into presidency, he messes up at least 3 times but no one cared, laughed, or was upset. Same goes for you. That acting class is an awesome idea and could help you open up and find a new hobby! Take it, and gooood luck! :)|`|1fuuANoraa	here is a link I found for self help (I wasn't looking for public speaking assistance, rather about parenting).  However, I have bookmarked the page because they add different self help EBook every so often (Monthly I think - but not (100% sure).  Anyhoo -- I notice that towards the bottom of the site there is an ebook on public speaking.  <br>  <br>  Check it out.  :)  p.s. don't imagine people in there underwear it is too distracting.|`|AA11952133	The thing about public speaking is, the more you do it the less terrified you will be.  It's only when you do it rarely that it gets really hard.<br>  <br>  If you don't have opportunities to do it often, then the next best thing is to practice reading aloud standing in front of a mirror.  If you do it with a tape recorder it is just like having an audience.<br>  <br>  And I think the weekend course is an excellent idea!  I took one and our teacher taught us amazing relaxation tricks.|`|gB2gyZbyaa	Hey,<br>  Public speaking can be fun when you are not nervous! try practicing in front of a mirror and ask family or friends if you can read them a poem or speech, try and look at these people while you speak, then when you are in front of strangers (or people you know) just pretend they are the people you trust the most... hope this helps i love public speakinG!|`|DsEEATKSaa	Join the local toastmaster's club.<br>  <br>  Far and away, this organization is the BEST for addressing this specific issue.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|MzWM9rBRaa	Practice practice practice.  It's really the only way.  Join a club or start in front of a small group of friends, then work your way up to bigger and bigger groups.  <br>  <br>  Your friends and family can give you tips on your performance so you can get better.  Always try to practice speeches and presentations in the mirror until you have it memorized to make it easier to not go blank
jqcL1GwQaa	1.A dream is your mind remaining active at night. You dream every night, but most people don't remember their dreams. <br>  <br>  2.Your mind never stops working, so you never really stop thinking, even in your sleep.<br>  <br>  3. Dreams can be meaningless. They could also be premonitions. They can also be your subconscious mind trying to tell you something. You can buy books, or look at websites with descriptions of what each symbol in your dream means. (ex: clouds mean spiritual harmony, inner peace, and compassion) If you want to use one of these sites, here is a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionar...</a><br>  <br>  But other people think it is best for you to figure out what each symbol means to you. I tend to agree with these people, but I admit that websites and books are easier. <br>  <br>  *Note*<br>  To anyone who takes an interest in dreaming, I recommend keeping a dream journal. It is important to remember your dreams. You can't interpret them if you don't remember them. Also writing it down helps you to put it in order and recognize what symbols stand out and are important. Some symbols aren't the main focus of the dream, and you will make yourself crazy trying to find out what every little thing means.<br>  <br>  =)|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  A dream is the product of the subconscious mind sorting out it's day & the issues you have de.lt with.<br>  <br>  We dream because our subconscious minds need to sort themselves out.<br>  <br>  They are shown to us in subconscious language -images - what they mean is for the dreamer to work out!<br>  <br>  Sadhara
AA12360662	Do not totally believe in dream books.  They are only reference of your dreams.  Dreams are the best interpreter of the dreams based on the knowledge of their life time experience, personalities and culture.<br>  <br>  In your case, dreaming of playing piano could mean things you want to discover or ability to be shown to others.  It all depends on whether you are a actual piano player, and how you view playing piano in your life.<br>  <br>  Rotten eggs could mean things that are not smooth in many way.  Projecting rotten eggs may reflect some helplessness.  Since eggs become rotten, and that may hint you miss the chance and so on.<br>  <br>  Cheese has nothing to do with what you dream, however stimulate food like chili, hot food may make your brain remember more on what you dream.<br>  <br>  The length of the dream or the length of time you remember the dream basically reflects whether the issue has been resolved.  <br>  <br>  In conclusion, your dreams reflect your desire, fear, personalities.  Whether they will come true as you projected, it is really up to what your daily life and how you face in day time.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Do you really believe in that?|`|6XGYzWYbaa	well what are your goals

You have to get back up and keep going.  You have control over how you keep your house. It is a sign of your untidy life. Get rid of clutter and get organized. It is a start and you will feel better. Keep trying with the book and look for a job, any kind of a job. It is up to you to make your life better.

Many people don't have those abilities.|`|thsalfKeaa	I think that none of this is your fault. You can not help what your dad did or what other people think or do.  Find someone else to be with.

All thought, good and bad, is creative and tends to become a material thing. That is why we must learn to be more positive. Our environment and all the experiences in our life are the result of our habitual and predominant thoughts.<br>  <br>  Negative thoughts can tell us about something that needs our attention. Our job is to discover what needs to be done and take care of it. Many people fail to see a negative occurrence as a learning experience and continue to feel victimized and helpless, ultimately blaming others for what they drew to themselves.<br>  <br>  You are not alone. You are not Hopeless. You are alive, and you are your own person.<br>  Good luck, l hope things go better soon.
C0K3Bo2Aaa	A narcissist thinks every thing is about or affects them some how. You can see this in very young children. I believe, this happens because they have been indulged and have never grown out of this behavior. Just my opinion.|`|8eCyY7RCaa	I am a narcissist.  I became this way because I know I'm the best.|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	I think i'm a narcissist because i've been single my entire life and i can't make friends.
DRGchuRGaa	i like the deja vu feelings i get somtimes... and when i speak to people about the same experience, we are generally agreed that some of the glimpses of deja vu we get are there for a reason... <br>    dont know what the reason is though... i do lots of dream interpretation and have done for years... and the 'seen it before' dreams can be quite unusual if you cant relate it to anything solid in your life..<br>    on a personal level.. when i get it.. i like to think that i'm going in a direction that was 'meant'.. if you get what i mean... and the ones with bad feelings attatched, i take as a mild warning that. what i'm doing was not meant to be...<br>    so at this level, i think we are quite capable of thinking on a level that cant quite be explained fully... but indeed may be the subconcious part of us passing info to the everyday thinking and reason, that we<br>  use as part of the daily survival routine...|`|SxqYguUCaa	That happens to me sometimes too. I feel like I've dreamt the same dream over again but I can't put my finger on when! Well, if you want to take a superstitious view on this, it could be that the dream you dreamt could be coming true. Ha. if not, just take it as one of those odd dream things that occurs- like feeling actual emotion in a dream or sometimes even pain.|`|bRghNySvaa	alot of times we dream thing that have a symbolic reference to something  either we are going to go through or something we have been through recurring dreams can also be caused by anxiety o fears such as dreaming you are falling over and over again and waking up just before you hit the ground but eventually we will find we land unhurt because of intervention of a branch from a tree or something else that softens our fall then the dream end traumatic experiences and things of violence on tv or other places also effect our dreams|`|xTpxoHHraa	The same thing happens to me a lot. I don't really know what it is. Like somtimes I sneez tie my shoe andsombody hands me a pencil about 2 seconds later and I felt like I dreamed it before. I just want you to know your not alone|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	I believe most of our dreams consist of images we have seen during our waking hours.  For instance, you might lazily sit and watch your dog gnawing at a bone  - then maybe you will dream your dog has floored YOU and is gnawing at you!<br>  Later you might be fooling with your dog on the carpet, and this Deva-ju feeling passes thro you.<br>  Thus, in this sense, dreams and reality become mixed - which would explain why sometimes you think you have experienced something or some place before.|`|vgpuTBmSaa	I used to experience the same thing frequently,  but it went away for a long time. Recently I have had a few similar episodes. From things that I have read, they are called fugues. I have no idea what causes them, but I do know that they are very significant both spiritually and psychologically. This leads me to believe that there is a higher power at work here; therefore I pay close attention to the details. <br>      Now that they are reaching a breakthrough in brain technologies, perhaps they will do some stiudies about this. We are not the only ones that have had this experience- I have been trying to generate more focus in the m,ental reseach on this and if they want volunteers, I will certainly fgive my time. If I learn anything new, I will let you know.
5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Having been abused as a child myself, I've made my share of calls to the police if I suspected abuse of any child or adult, gender does not even enter into the equation. Every child (and adult) deserves to have a life free of emotional, physical and sex abuse-there is no excuse for it. I don't care if ppl call themselves feminists or masculinists, I'll call them on it. Plenty of feminists work with abused adults and children, and are legally bound to report suspected abuse. <br>  <br>  I've never bothered with the Vagina Monologues, the title alone didn't do much for me to interest me. The title sounded like a way to get attention and I didn't take it seriously. If it promotes sexual abuse in any way, I would be adamantly opposed to it, as I am about any thing that promotes sexual abuse of boys or men as well.   <br>  <br>  To be equally fair, what are masculinists doing about male child abusers? What about their leaders who promote incest, like WIlliam Farrell? Where's the condemnation?|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I know there are examples of inattention to male abuse on the part of certain feminists. Thankfully, they are rare.|`|QbzvWJe0aa	I have never turned a blind eye to any kind of abuse, be it children, men or women. I am part of Amnesty International. I contribute and try to help the best I can against this. I think the word "feminist", "feminism", is really deformed in this place. <br>  <br>  I am a third world country feminist. I just can't understand why all the hate about defending yourself and asking to be treated as a human being.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I can't imagine any excuse for hurting a child. The only feminist argument might be the recognition of post natal syndrome which is a real depressive illness that can cause women to harm their children. As much as this is abuse, I think the reaction should be to get the mother treatment (better yet prevention) instead of sending her to jail.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	They do? I didn't know that, indeed any ridiculous imbecile is calling herself a feminist nowadays then. Child abuse is something women that can be considered feminists have fought against actually.|`|UxdjYFJaaa	No... abuse is abuse. I've never heard of what you're talking about.|`|d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	I have worked with feminist organzations that attempt to stop any kind of child abuse.  The whole way the justice system is set up not only allows child abusers to not be charged but the whole idea of shame and blame attributed to the child keeps this devastating crime from being in the forfront of judicial reformation.<br>  I have never heard anything so sickening as accusing someone of encouraging this behaviour and the depts that some will sink to is disgusting just to promote their own agenda.|`|AA11610779	I heard about the Vagina Monologues. Apparently, some (why not ALL? Maybe all of them, now) companies do not do that chapter anymore, which I think is a good idea. It's really disturbing that it was published in the first place.
rG5VxxNKaa	When people get screwed by their government (i.e. the housing fiasco). The people become scared to buy things so production stops.  You get over a recession by instilling confidence back in the economy (i.e. the people).|`|4Vchxp32aa	pessimism.  get rid of the pessimism and all is well.|`|YyXtxeNGaa	Every election cycle the Democrats and the overwhelmingly liberal news media lambaste the Republicans and try to convince the population how bad off they are financially so they will vote a Democrat into office.  In fact Jesse Jackson had a favorite expression when addressing Blacks:  "Vote Your Pocketbook!"<br>  This time they went way too far!  They did not realize the size of the snowball they pushed down the hill.<br>  <br>  A particular contributing factor is that during the Clinton administration they decided to promote home ownership to every warm body in America regardless of their financial history.  The government effectively FORCED lending institutions to make loans to risky individuals.  When these individuals defaulted, it upset the balance in supply and demand in the housing market which led to layoffs, no demand for building materials, and ultimately a snowball effect and the resulting downward spiral.
Ruifi0GSaa	Death= Change, the old dying off in order to make way for the new. The end of an issue or relationship.<br>  Naked= Feeling vulnerable, exposed, embarrassed.

uyRf8HyCaa	Haha it does! Its especially frustrating when you have a vague remembrance of the dream but cant put your finger on what happened. In a physcology  class my sister took she actually learned if you tell yourself all day that "I will remember my dreams" and a few times before bed, you actually like triple your chances of remembering! Give it a try and see if it works, just hope its not a nightmare! LOL good luck :)|`|AA11952133	OMG YES!  Now I have a book next to my bed so I can write them down the moment I wake up.

IE revenge.<br>  <br>  The other day I overheard a disgusting conversation between 2 young women before one of my classes started. <br>  <br>  Girl A: Did you hear about Girl C's boyfriend cheating on her?<br>  Girl B: Yea she's beastly, she broke his wrist and 2 ribs. <br>  Girl A: Well if any of my men cheat on me I'll have to get her involved.<br>  Girl A & B: *laugh*<br>  <br>  *Girl C comes around the corner*<br>  <br>  Girl A & B: We were just talking about you.<br>  Girl C: *smile*<br>  Girl A: Yea I was sayin if any men cheated on me I'd call you.<br>  Girl C: *laughs*<br>  <br>  I was so utterly disgusted overhearing how casual this exchange was. I was tempted to voice my opinion over it but since I didn't know the actual facts I declined to get involved.<br>  <br>  Now if you would of heard three men talking like that with women within earshot..what do you think would happen?<br>  <br>  People with the mindset of becomming judge and jury regarding what someone "deserves" within the realms of physical punishment really need to take a step back and ask what they themselves deserve.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	Who ever told you that it was acceptable for a woman to hit a man.

Sometimes people just don't realise.  As for having 49 friends on FB, well i wouldn't read too much into that.  Some people on FB add everyone and anyone just to make themselves look popular.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is build up your confidence - why not take up a new hobby where you will meet new people?

Most people in there are attention seekers who will add friends just to look popular. You're just 19, you have many things to see in your life and many things to do. Just try to be happy with yourself and be confident. Do the things you like, even just by yourself, and live your life the way you want it.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	You seem to be putting too much emphasis on your perceived lack of social skills.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you attempt to concentrate on nurturing one close friendship, rather than focusing on being the life of the party or the center of attention. <br>  <br>  That one friendship can give you the happiness and contentment that you now lack.  You don't need a hundred good friends when you have at least one best friend and many close acquaintances.

2FWxIbpgaa	Anthropology is the broad study of human cultures and societies, past and present, human language, the biological human animal, our evolution, primate relatives, and social behavior.  Anthropology is huge field, and is interdisciplinary in nature, with four general subfields: cultural, biological, linguistics and archeology.  <br>  <br>  Psychology is the study of the human mind and the brain, function, behavior, and cognition of the individual.<br>  <br>  Biology is the study of living organisms, from plants to animals, bacteria to fungi, metabolic processes, from mitosis and meiosis, RNA and DNA, genetics, essentially from microbiology to macrobiology, ecology, animal behavior, and the classification of living things.<br>  <br>  There is overlap in the three broad disciplines, certainly.  Psychology and Cultural Anthropology overlap in terms of behavior, art, myth, and folklore.  Biological Anthropology overlaps Psychology in the sense of the physical workings of the brain, anatomy and structure of the human nervous system (especially within the realm of Medical Anthropology and also in Forensic Anthropology).<br>  <br>  Biology overlaps Anthropology particularly in the arena of human evolution, paleoanthropology, osteology, the classification of our species and our close relatives, living and extinct.  Biology also overlaps Biological/Physical Anthropology also in the field of genetics, evolution, natural selection, gene flow, genetic drift, and mutation.  A fundamental understanding of biological processes is very necessary to biological anthropology.|`|0MeR1C1maa	Anthropology and Biology are really close, actually, but Anthropology is separated from Psychology by all the words starting with B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O, as well as most of the P words.|`|df3bacf9451198fdc8a33199106b5652aa	Cultrural Anthropology and Sociology are about the psychology of groups of people, small scaled populations are studied by Anthropologists (through qualitative approach) whilst the Sociologists go for larger societies (interconnected groups, parts that belong to industrialized cities mostly) by the help of telephones and questionnaires.<br>  <br>  For Biology and psychology meaning just read the rest of the answers.<br>  <br>  Also note that the above mentioned Anthropology has nothing to do with the branch of Biology that studies the physiological processes of the human body.|`|QM2UqZmuaa	Anthropology can answer the question: how is it that Indians and Pakistanis get along together in the U.S. if they don't speak the same language and not of the same religion?<br>  <br>  For example, Indian/Pakistani neighborhoods in the U.S., exist, and they get along with each other. The language they speak is different, so they communicate in English. Indians are mostly Hindus while Pakistanis are mostly Muslims.<br>  <br>  But, they are the same race.<br>  <br>  Another example is Bosnians and Serbians. Bosnians are traditionally Muslim. Serbians are traditionally Christian. And they don't speak the same language, Bosnian and Serbian, but yet outside of Bosnia and Serbia, they can migrate to their own neighborhoods in the U.S.<br>  <br>  In this case, there is no psychology involved, no biology involved. It's hard to unite people of different religions, such as Christians and Muslims, that closely.<br>  <br>  Just like people of the same religion can get along if they are different race, well that's no longer anthropology in the cultural sense, people of the same race can get along even if they don't have the same religion or speak a common fluent language (or common, mother-tongue, language).<br>  <br>  Anthropology divides them together - they get along anthropologically.|`|pKQ6QA7faa	psych is the study of the brain and what it leads you to do - choices you makes, things you think, problems you have. biology is generally genetics, health issues, medical/living issues. anth has interrelationships with both. it is the study of people, their culture, their past. more of a historical approach i would say. it has 4 main branches: archaeology>the study of the past cultural remains, biological>genetics of the people being studied, plagues, primates, etc, cultural> it is what it sounds like, culture past and present, and linguistic> study of the languages used and how it is formed, how it differs, etc.

If you are referring to employment when you talk about getting NOWHERE (note the spelling), if your depression and anxiety come out in your interview, the employer would probably be less likely to hire you than to hire someone who displays confidence.  Keep working on getting control of your depression and anxiety, and keep working on being more confident about yourself.  It will pay off.|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Most people study to just learn certain facts. Others study to better themselves. It's all a question of motivations. My wife has a BS degree in psychology, yet, I am always coming up with creative solutions to her problems that she uses with her job. It digs at her like you would not believe! Yet the reason is that I study psychology to not just get a degree, but, to be a better person. The same thing is true but in reverse with my writing. My wife is a natural at grammar and composition, and she will take a 4 page subject I've written and turn it into a 20 page work of art! She does this because "this" is her passion! Find your passion or find a way to make what ever you are working on, your passion.

As a single individual you should be able to go and have sex with any willing woman every day if you want to and they are aware that this isn't serious. But doing this when you are in a relationship and your partner wants to be monogamous is wrong. Either you break up or you follow the terms of the relationship. As a free individual you are entitled to make any personal choice you like as long as someone else is not directly hurt.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	The way monogamy works in our society is with the forsaking all others thing and most people agree to that in a relationship (even though most people end up cheating).<br>  <br>  Some people to have open relationships the way you describe and if that works for them I really don't care. I'd rather avoid that for several reasons, most notably that it tends to get very messy as well because jealousy is also a natural urge.<br>  <br>  BTW even with a condom it's not 100% safe which is one reason why I wouldn't want to risk it.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|rjVALevtaa	So are you saying that we should do nothing in life but act on our instincts?

But not everyone feels that such a thing is acceptable. I know I certainly don't. And if you do act on these instincts, you have to ask yourself if meaningless sex is really worth the possible pain you may cause your partner? If the answer is yes, then you shouldn't be in a relationship.|`|66tTuuIFaa	Oh that's rich.

However, if you don't mind YOUR gf to cheat on you, then that's fine if you both do it! Or even if she doesn't mind but doesn't want to see other guys. But at least be honest about it. You may find someone who doesn't mind.|`|QlXhPFSwaa	i honestly, am afraid of intimacy. i dont think im emotionally strong and prepared. i disagree with your "WE as humans WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE! " statement. as boring as it may sound, i have to trust the person and of course be madly in love with the person and it has to be mutual in order for me to have sex. i am also a germaphobe. so i have to ask my partner to first have an AIDS/STD test and of course he has to have negative result on that!!!.... at least an hour long bath enough to scrub each and every part of his body, floss and scrape tongue not just brush the teeth and mouthwash, what else.... ya that's about it... <br>  <br>  oh if you have a gf? i feel sorry for her. you might be passing STD on her. if my sex partner wanna have sex with other people, i won't tell him no. im not the type to do that anyway.. but it also means our relationship is capital O -V - E -R EXCLAMATION PT!!!!!!!!!!! go have sex with others all you want just dont put that thing in me EVER again... horny good for nothing perv.<br>  <br>  im surprised people like u still exist even after the AIDS brouhaha in the 80s.|`|XwqePXrOaa	As I said to the last person who asked this question, we also want to kill people who make us angry.  Instinctually speaking, I mean - when someone does something we think is wrong, our instinct is to attack them physically, ideally until they're dead.<br>  <br>  For another example, if I'm on a camping trip with friends, but we didn't think to bring enough food and we're going to have to ration until we get back to a market, my instinct is to eat all the food and fight off anyone who tries to stop me - particularly if I view myself as the alpha male.  My instinct is also to try to mate with any of the attractive females - never mind if they're in relationships with someone else.<br>  <br>  Do you think we should?  Or do we put restrictions on our instincts sometimes, to function in a society wherein we try not to hurt people?|`|YQOT68xFaa	The incentive to fight? <br>  1) Safe sex is a myth. Condoms aren't foolproof and neither are pills or IUDs. People still spread diseases and still have unwanted pregnancies.<br>  2) You are not some rutting animal incapable of controlling your base drives (general "you", not specific!).<br>  3) It is immoral behaviour.<br>  4) It's a waste of time and in the long run it really isn't fulfilling.<br>  <br>  People use the whole "humans aren't naturally monogamous" thing as an excuse to justify acting like an animal. Personally, I don't buy that. Yeah, we get attracted to more than one person. So what? Should we just give in to every urge? Does the natural-ness (like my new word? lol) of a feeling mean that there is nothing wrong with it? <br>  <br>  And this:<br>  "If I go around F'ing a new woman every other day, but come home to you every night, that means I like you. Appreciate that and go find an authentic and complete connection with another which goes beyond sex, so much so that having sex with someone else is simply that- sex, not "cheating"."<br>  <br>  *puke*  What are we, a stray dog?
yf7M2DHLaa	Your dreams are connected, especially the part of the deep ocean & whales.  Your are craving a larger piece of life, something with much deeper meaning than that which you currently have.

Stretching these comfort zones is healthy, breaking through is not. She may find an equally emotionless guy and live happily ever after.

VxtA3ckhaa	There's a type of learning where one should put aside all her beliefs and previous attained knowledge. Simply absorbing the information given. This kind of study is called research. <br>  Then there's times when you are actually learning. You question a piece of info you have just received you try to justify it with past experience. Here you'll create a new idea. You have LEARNED something. <br>  An example would be if you teach a child 1+1=2. The child must listen without using her own thoughts. Once she fully understands the idea, she can create her own solutions to problems: 2+5=7. Until on a infinitely greater scale: E=MC2 Etc.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	'ello!!  =)<br>  <br>  Très interesante question! I think often times a part of one's experiences will end up in a fact they learn. For example, when one is memorizing a story or history, one incorporates different elements of the story, remembers specific facts and associates certain parts with their own life or other facts they know. No one person will go through the same process; everybody brings in a part of their previous knowledge/experiences when facing a new situation or, likewise, when facing something new they are to learn.|`|qhU3PDgfaa	creativity has no limits..<br>  neither does learning..<br>  <br>  i guess they just go hand in hand.. <br>  you start learning how to use photoshop.. and with the help of that knowledge..our creativity starts flowing..

There are tons of families throughout the USA in which the man is a happy, family guy who doesn't have to be forced to spend time with his wife and kids.  Despite what you see on Jerry Springer, Maury and court shows, men aren't dogs that like to hop from hydrant to hydrant.

All he has to do is what one man on the court show did when a woman asked him to marry her:  RUN.  If he doesn't, he can't blame anyone but himself.  Marriage is a contract where you give your word...making a promise that you will love one person forever.  If you can't (for whatever reason) you shouldn't take the ring or the lady.

Shyness (introversion) is not a PROBLEM! It's a character trait that is not unique but really digs at the psyche of those who are extroverted. We are normal. Look up introversion and instead of wishing you were different try to embrace the personality! You will find a lot about yourself that you will never want to lose. Biggest I think is that introverts make few friends but, those friends are life long friends. My ex was an extrovert and after we broke up she confided in me that one of the times she was most jealous of me was with my friends. They would never leave me and some are 20 years in length.

Having been in the military and having gone through a TON of these classes, they're nothing more than teaching one to act professional and behave while at work.  There's no reason a person needs to make a racial slur or slap someone on the butt.  It should be obvious that one shouldn't try to use their position to gain sex or to degrade another worker.  It SHOULD be obvious, but to some its not.  Thus the training is more of a way to say "this is wrong and don't do it around your co-workers."  Now what one does in their personal life is one thing.  However, if you're working next to me, I expect the sexist and racist comments to be at a nil.  <br>  <br>  Again, its not "feminist thinking" (just showing your own bias here) but really "politically correct" thinking when it comes to gender, race, ethnicity, and religion (as all of these are covered in sensitivity training).|`|WSwDFwC5aa	No, it's a euphemism for "waste of time".<br>  <br>  People who are insensitive to the feelings of others can't be converted to a different way of thinking by "training."  Similarly, people who already are sensitive to the feelings of others cannot possibly benefit from such a course (because they, by definition, don't need it).<br>  <br>  There is a place for educational experiences that can help you see things from others' points of view, but this is not what sensitivity training generally offers.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	The real problem is that the sensitivity goes only one way. If you are White, male, or middle class you are the butt of endless jokes and derision. <br>  <br>  Free speech is important if we value freedom, and this means we need to be prepared to feel offended every now and again. After all, trying to build a world without offence is like trying to build a world without bacteria - it is a waste of time and only results in hypersensitive (allergic) weaklings.|`|AA11610779	I'd like to thank CAustin II's explanation as I had no idea what "sensitivity training" was.

It really depends on what they "teach" you during the course. <br>  <br>  I thought it was about "men finding their feminine side"! lol!|`|qVmIokXPaa	Certainly it's brainworshing. Or a waste of time, or a call for conforming..

It's also a euphemism for "hand over your individuality and believe like you're told". <br>  <br>  And feminists are not the only ones who are big into "sensitivity training".

Doesn't mean she doesn't hate what has happened and what she has seen, but she is a strong woman.  Anyone who has been through that is not likely to ever be "over it". She's probably not bluffing, but who would expect her to ever bee 100% ok with it?<br>  <br>  She may have killed someone under specific circumstances.  Just like many American veterans have.  <br>  <br>  One of my best professors at school was an Iranian veteran who had fought in the iran/iraq conflict.  He was very short with people who did not respect his ideas of peace, but he had a wealth of wisdom from surviving these conflicts.

Unless those two people have worked through their personal histories and have become healthier people themselves, however, they are most likely to hve a lot of problems in their relationship together.  When you grow up carrying strong feelings based upon a "nad past," those do not magically go away, nor can another person fix those.  You have to fix yourselves, through support groups and/or counseling.  This will give the two of you a better chance at having healthier self-respect and healthier relationships.

a66UyAh8aa	Yeah, it's sickening. The fact that people get off on violence (particularly murder) against women would *have* to be an indication of profound mental health issues. The frightening thing is, so many ppl  *do* find this stuff erotic. I don't think there's any way of stopping the combination of the words sex and violence together, but I do cringe whenever I see violence in the same context as sex. The site you're referring to, takes the cake though.<br>  <br>  I had to chuckle at the irony to some of these answers. Some of them complain that feminists are apathetic to violence against men in the same breath as their obvious apathy to your question. Did they even notice your question? <br>  <br>  But really, gotta love "sources" that Doodlebugjim provides and other anti-fems here consider "peer reviewed" The best they can find to support their assertions that it's perpetrated 50/50 is from a book written over 30 years ago that's never been referred to by one credible contemporary source. The only time you see the name Suzanne Steinmetz is on MRA sites including Doodlebugjim and Marx's own websites! One book stating it's 50/50 compared to thousands of studies in the past 30 odd years confirming over and over again that the vast majority of DV is perpetrated by men. Geez, I wonder which source to believe! And they call all the other studies cherry picked! Hilarious!|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	What's disturbing is how feminists only seem to find violence unacceptable when its against women. When its against men, well hey they deserve it, right? <br>  <br>  Example: <br>  Suzanne Steinmetz is a reasearcher who found that the rate of domestic violence by women against men is about the same as that by men against women. Regarding the harrassment she and other authors got from feminists who didn't want her findings to go public, she said: <br>  "In an attempt to keep me from speaking ... at an American Civil Liberties Union conference... [the ACLU] were told if they allowed me to speak the place would be bombed" (p.112). Another of the authors was the victim of a sustained hate campaign. <br>  <br>  I find the reaction of the feminist movement to male victims of female violence far more disturbing than any of the stuff I see at the cinema (which incidentally often includes female heroines beating the hell out of men).|`|uX4XEXGxaa	I find it pretty disturbing, though its also pretty sad someone would go through the time to make a site dedicated to something like that.

The feminist kept ranting about the Hostel films, in which various people were killed. Apparently, the women who were killed were sexualized with focus on thier breasts and naked bodies while all the men who died were killed in head-shots only...<br>  <br>  Incredibly, the feminist insisted that only women's genitalia were focused on - despite the following scene: (WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT VIA YOUTUBE)|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	It's not wrong in the sense that the scenes in the movies are perfectly legitimate and part of entertainment, but in this context, where people are seeking out images of beautiful women being hurt or killed, is truly disturbing.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Garbage in, Garbage out.

u9C5Q1uLaa	To dream that you are kissing someone else's boyfriend or girlfriend, indicates your wish to be a relationship and to experience the energy of love. You may be sexually acting out. You may also need to awaken your passion. Alternatively, it indicates a lack of integrity on your part. If you are kissing a close friend, then it represents your respect and adoration for your friend. It may or may not signify a romantic interest for him or her. <br>  To dream that you are being carried, suggests that you are feeling like a burden to somebody. You need to be more independent and take on more responsibilities. Alternatively, it may elude to romance. <br>  <br>  I think, hon, that you feel you need to act on these romantic impulses you are dreaming about. Try to talk to Guy 2, try to find out if he likes you. See if you both feel the same way.

If it's not that it is that someone is playing around with your feelings and wants to hurt you, someone that is controlling you.

6mVpfmR6aa	I find your questions interesting.  <br>  <br>  You know there are some religious considerations related to the question of having immediate sex, not to mention health/disease considerations.  <br>  <br>  Also, although it took a long while, I learned through experience not to judge the strength of a relationship or a woman's feelings on whether or not we had sex.  <br>  I find that if a woman is willing to argue with me, she has invested more than if she has sex with me.  The women who argued with me were the ones who stuck with me for a long time.   <br>  <br>  Just to tell you, based upon comments that women make, if you meet a guy in a nightclub, the later the hour (say 4 or 5 in the morning), the more of a chance that guy will immediately want to have sex with you.  So try the after hours clubs (aka Last Chance Saloons).   I hope this helps you.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Maybe the fact that most people obsess over sex. That some think it's the best thing since sliced bread.

F6uAWBluaa	Here's a very generalized timeline:<br>  <br>  1) woman (or man) falls in love with a charming, lovable person<br>  2) jealousy and control set in<br>  3) marriage? children? buy a house? own a pet or two? <br>  4) self-esteem, a protective factor, is slowly destroyed <br>  5) abuse begins, both emotional (highly controlling, belittling comments, etc.) and physical or sexual abuse<br>  6) threats of death (of wife and/or kids)<br>  7) threats of taking away the kids (see Leadership Council on Child Abuse for info on how often batterers get kids)<br>  <br>  Further obstacles:<br>  Woman is embarassed. Fears no one will believe her. May not get help from church or family or friends. May believe marriage is for "beter or for worse." May believe she deserves to be hit. May believe man will change - he probably promises her he will. <br>  <br>  He probably controls the phone, her whereabouts, her access to money. <br>  <br>  He probably threatens to kill her and when we read about men that kill their wife (& kids) this confirms her belief - she believes he is capable of murder. <br>  <br>  There may not be a domestic violence shelter around her. There are only 2400 in the US. They may be full. They may not allow kids. <br>  <br>  <br>  Battering is very different from common couple confict. Battering is very systematic. It involves a high degree of control and coercion. It involves threats and torture. The beatings can be horrendous. <br>  <br>  However, he may appear charming and in control (remember the serial killer who preyed on young women to help him?) in public. <br>  <br>  He may also apologize profusely and have a "honeymoon period" with her. He might threaten to kill himself. <br>  <br>  all types of controlling strategies are used to keep her in the house...<br>  <br>  Why not ask "what happens to women that leave" for that is highly interesting too....they dont' live no "happily ever after' either - society ignores them -|`|O5KOwhovaa	1- They are unable to, due to fear, lack of support, and financial dependence.<br>  <br>  2- They have developed psychological problems which bond them to their abusers.<br>  <br>  3- They have nowhere else to go.<br>  <br>  4- They have children and ties to keep them with their abuser.<br>  <br>  5- Other people encourage them to stay ("enablers").|`|AA11539543	The worst part of the abuse is mental , the victim becomes convinced that they can't survive without the abuser to think for them .|`|gHxmYuGmaa	Fear or threats play a part.

And guess what? Many abusers do kill their partners who try to leave or do leave. Most of us have to work, so victims are killed on their way to and from work or at their workplace, as well as at their homes.<br>  <br>  Check this story out from 2/09: Study: More women are being killed for trying to leave partner: <a href="http://www.owatonna.com/news.php?viewStory=103582" rel="nofollow">http://www.owatonna.com/news.php?viewSto...</a><br>  <br>  I'd say that's a good incentive to stay with an abuser. Restraining orders aren't that easy to get, and women have still been killed after filing a restraining order, it didn't do a bit of good.

Yet, some stay because they believe beyond a glimmer of hope their partner is going to change and they'll live happily ever after.|`|AA11589988	Ultimately it's because the women don't want to take that final step to leave their abusers! They love the abuser even if he puts the woman's life in danger. I think it's wrong to imply that abusers have mysterious powers over the conscious wills of victims in these cases. That makes women seem like children. They have a choice - leave even if it breaks your heart or continue to be abused. The police, charities and the criminal justice system are very supportive of women who are in abusive situations.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Some do.  But fo rvarious reason some don't.  Sometimes they haven't got anywhere to go, and if they have children, they may not be willing to leave the children, or alternatively to make them homeless.<br>  <br>  Or they may love the man, and hope he will change.  And abusive men often do claim that they are going to change, and some of them may even mean it, at the time. Not all abusive men are abusive all the time, some can be very charming inbetween the bouts of violence, for instance.  'Abuse' covers a wide variety of behaviours, not all abusive men are the same.|`|GHd84xipaa	i feel that most women who stay with their abuser is because they have low self esteen and were made to fill worthless.so they think there's no other man who would want them.they feel that there is no help for them to be on their own or a safe place to go to.this abuser has provided food and home for them,so they feel this is the life style they have to live.i have found that most abused women were treated that way when they lived at home with their parents.so this has been a life style they are accustom to.there is help for these women.most states have a hot line they can call to get help.there are safe houses for them, also.once you get the help you need,they will help you get your life back together and get a trade or education so you can find a good job and live on your own.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Its very complicated. When a woman (or a man) is in an abusive relationship, the abuser suceeds in brainwashing them to a certain extent.

Second is many women are taught that there job is to make a marriage work and so leaving or divorcing gives them a sense of shame or failure. To some women, they can't even face their own families if they feel they've done the family wrong by divorcing. In more extreme cases, the victim has lived with violence all her life, and while she may not like it, she feels it's part of a relationship.|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Yes, brilliant answers on here, I couldn't do it because it seemed like it may have been my fault & I so didn't want to be 'alone'.

It was the exact same setting and everything when she did die two weeks later. I have odd dreams and visions. You never know when you are going to have one. About the demands actually spelled demons,could be trying to get you. Sounds crazy and don't be scared. Just remember that you believe in god pray every day and night. Wear a cross and also a way to keep demons out is to have a light. Demons don't like light at all. Just get like a lamp or a kind of big night light or even keep your light in your room on. I know these kind of things because I had a bad experience 2 years ago. They took me to hell literally and then god or an angel led me out and then at night they would scratch the wall and make very disturbing noises. I see ghosts all the time and angels that wear different colored robes. Don't be afraid. God will protect you. He always will.If you want to know more about being psychic I would get a book(this book really helped me) LINK:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghosts-Among-Us-Uncovering-Truth/dp/0061553395/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236577231&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ghosts-Among-Us-Un...</a> <br>  <br>  Or here is another book I am reading now  LINK:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Psychic-Book-Discover-Abilities/dp/1580629695/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236577354&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Psychic...</a><br>  <br>  You don't have to buy it online you probably could find them at your local bookstore.<br>  <br>  If you want to discuss this in a privately then contact me at greencocat@yahoo.com .

e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	It's because women aren't as interested as men in these fields.<br>  <br>  You're thinking like a true feminist if you think this is something that needs 'fixing'. It's just a bunch of women making a choice to do something else. By trying to fix it, we'd be doing an injustice on two counts:<br>  (a) We'll be doing an injustice to genuinely interested men (who want to take the field)<br>  (b) We'll be doing an injustice to genuinely disinterested women (who don't want the field)<br>  <br>  I don't see how we can fix this without either forcing women to join the field or increasing the number of seats for women, which means worthy and interested men get left out just to make place for women who don't want to be there.<br>  <br>  Equality is believing that people should be free to make their own choices and do what they like with their lives. Equality doesn't mean there has to be an equal number of men and women in everything.|`|mCAWxobNaa	There are basically two simple reasons:<br>  <br>  1)  Women don't do as well as men do (this has been shown in any number of studies).<br>  <br>  2)  Women are simply not interested in careers in the maths or hard sciences.<br>  <br>  The article I've cited below explains this beautifully, I think.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	It's a bunch of complex reasons why men and women don't go into fields that are dominated by one gender. In high school, I was ok at some math and science but not others and believed the myth that girls weren't good at them anyway. I had hoped that was changing, but..I don't see a big push encouraging boys to take english and social sciences either. It's a mixture of sexism and economics that affect boys and girls occupation choices. <br>  <br>  In high school I had male teachers mock me because I did better than boys in some subjects. I didn't care because I wanted to get out of that backwater, but it wasn't easy to do well in that atmosphere. I went into natural resources in college and was treated like I was looking for an MRS, quite a change from high school. First I was an egghead nerd, then I was a gold digger looking for a husband. I hated it since I really wanted outdoor ed, but had a bad adviser and didn't know there was a program at my university. I gave up and studied psych as it interested me. <br>  <br>  I realized I needed a job so I took an aptitude test and found out I was good at accounting and data processing. Not either one had been of interest to me, but I tried them both out at a community college. Loved data processing, and had very supportive male teachers.Too bad kids weren't given aptitude tests in junior, high school and college so you knew what your choices were and tried a few things you might not have otherwise. It changed my life and am so relieved I took control of my life and took a few tests are a community college.|`|qbelhflAaa	"There is a real gender gap, and it’s growing rapidly, but that gap has little to do with graduation rates or college-entrance rates, parameters that are given great emphasis in the report. The real gender gap is not in ability but in motivation—not in what girls and boys can do, but in what girls and boys want to do: specifically, in what they want to learn, and how they want to learn it."|`|K4zsztkRaa	It's very easy. Women just tend not to enjoy those lines of work as much as men. Men tend to lean more towards that carreer.<br>  <br>  That's why there are more female nurses. Women tend to like the job more. But it doesn't mean that men can't do it or it's not a man's job it's just men don't typicaly go into that field of work. It's very simple.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|NYU37jfGaa	When you say 'consider famous examples like Marie Curie', what other famous examples are there?  Marie Curie was doing her work a hundred years ago.  Who is there now?  Marie Curie was a long, long time, ago, you can't keep on dragging her up.  Who are some well-known present day women in technical fields?<br>  <br>  The reason fewer women choose to go into these fields is that fewer women want to.  You can't 'fix' it.  if women arent' interested in pursuing careers in technical fields, you can't make them.  And why should you want to?  Is there any particualar advantage to having women engineers and physicists, as opposed to male ones?  <br>  <br>  And if women are being favoured over men when it comes to scholarships etc, then frankly I think that is quite disgraceful.  I thoroughly disapprove of this sort of social engineering.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	People vary. People have different aptitudes.<br>  <br>  There are some aptitudes more common in one sex than the other. Thus, it may be the numbers never become 50/50.<br>  <br>  There's a deep structural bias in academia and other areas, for those willing and able to devote their late teens, though thirties to their careers.<br>  <br>  Most people want to procreate. Men can either postpone this, or consign it to their partners; women don't have this choice.<br>  <br>  If you look at who's in which field, that includes many decades' worth, including before there was any movement toward equal rights for women. The equal performance of females in high school math is really recent; we won't be seeing the fields filled with the current high school generation for decades. (there's a time lag)<br>  <br>  Scholarships are only one aspect. If some people are discouraged from something, as long as they remember, encouraged in some other field, that will cut down the numbers (females tend to be "counseled" into some fields, out of others).<br>  <br>  Once in a college program, it can be really hard to be a consistent minority inall one's classes, year after year. If there's "hazing" and other social pressure, that's going to cut down the numbers.<br>  <br>  If one gets the impression in one's college classes, that a field is unfriendly toward one, it's makes you rething,and consider finding a field where you won't be considered an outsider, or incompetent regardless of one's abilities. Especially those fields where one uses the same sorts of aptitudes.<br>  <br>  These are the reasons that sprang to mind.<br>  <br>  As people get used to the concept that the configuration of one's genitalia are irrelevant to almost everything, things will (slowly) improve.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Because, on the whole, men have a brain that shows a better aptitude for such subjects, and also, again, on the whole, they are subjects that men tend to be more interested in.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	female  brains can't deal with that kind of stuff.

School level maths and science is not high level.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/09/shame-on-uc-davis-and-reporter-sharon.html" rel="nofollow">http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/09/sham...</a><br>  <br>  You ask how do we fix this? I don't see it as a problem! There is no reason why men and women should be equally good at everything. Male and female brains are quite different on average. Of course in any population there will be variability and some women's brains are more like men's brains and vice versa. Anyone, male or female who has the ability to do well in science or mathematics should be encouraged but it would be absurd to try and force equal outcomes for men and women when hard wired skills just cannot be socialised into people!<br>  Edit:<br>  The excellent article that Gaspari has given a link to shows what is at stake. It's the equity agenda of the radical left versus science itself! These equity lunatics are truly frightening to people who care about science especially as they have high powered friends in politics.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Because old attitudes die hard. I'm in the life sciences and still regularly face negative feed back from people about being a woman in the sciences, and the stigma isn't as great here as for things like physics and engineering. Fortunately, for me it's not so much my colleagues/friends (I wouldn't keep those 'friends') as passing acquaintances, and really what business is it of theirs anyway?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many young women when deciding on careers still get this negative feedback from 'people that matter', like their peers, their parents, their siblings, and their teachers and guidance counsellors. On top of that, there is still the message in N. American society as a whole (and I suspect many others, but can't speak for them) that 'women are not good at maths and sciences'. Growing up in this context, one cannot help to absorb this message and internalize it, as faulty as it is.<br>  <br>  Top that off with things like boys still getting the majority of the teachers' attention in math and science classes (though this is thankfully changing) - sorry, I read this study a while ago, so don't have the citation. Also, I remember during my undergrad (not that long ago) reading in the student paper at least once a month, though usually more often, of cases of women in the engineering department - students and profs - who had been attacked, beaten and/or raped for no other reason than being female in engineering. Hopefully, this has changed, but again, old attitudes die hard, and even if the behaviours have stopped, I suspect the underlying 'women have no business being here' beliefs among *some* (hopefully, only a few) of the men in that dept probably still remains.<br>  <br>  All of these things make it very difficult for a woman to conceive of entering the sciences, sticking with them, and getting out physically and psychologically unscarred. <br>  <br>  Three cheers to those who are forging ahead with it - it makes the way easier for those who follow, and is helping to create a system that will ultimate benefit humankind as a whole.|`|zXPGm2fraa	The truth is that obviously people don't want to admit, is that girls are socialized subtly and overtly out of fields like that, I know, I was one of them. Kids don't understand that giving in to social pressures is a detriment to their future, and parents often don't back up their daughters,especially if they were socialized the same way. The top minds percentile wise in my class specifically were 3 to 1  female, but by the time we reached senior year in H.S. the boys were still "geniuses" and the girls had mostly dropped to average classes. It's not the IQ that changes, it's something else. Like my algebra teacher that hated girls, or the science club that was all boys and treated me like an intruder, probably because I was just as smart as them. And the female teachers that don't support their female students, they treat them like competition. It's all there, people just don't want to look at it because it's too much work, easier to let things stay the same. And if someone does try to do something about it, there are a zillion people telling them to sit down and be quiet.<br>  <br>  Edit: You can see all the thumbs down on those who are telling their own experiences with this that yes there are a lot of people who don't want to hear the truth. It's not just male teachers that discourage, it's female teachers too. Not all male and not all female, just enough of them to create a negative environment for girls.<br>  I spoke to a woman whose daughter went through school to be an engineer, she graduated Magna *** Laude. She was hired on a ship that was all males except for her, and they almost killed her, physically, not metaphorically. There's another personal experience. That girl made it through the education system, only to be attacked while performing her career. Maybe that's a reason too why people don't encourage their female kids to go into male-dominated careers, fear for their safety and peace of mind.<br>  <br>  Edit: lol answers edited magnacumlaude|`|un0C52G8aa	It might also be that these jobs don't pay all that well, considering all the education that is required for them. For these jobs, people have to have an advanced degree to even be competitive. Perhaps women don't really want to spend all those years in college when they can get jobs that pay better and don't require as much education.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I think it comes down to interest more than ability. I'm sure if I really tried I could have done better in math and science in highschool, but the thought of doing that sort of work for life seems incredibly tedious. <br>  <br>  I think both men and woman can be good in math, but men just seem to enjoy it more.|`|qKkTI0jnaa	Overall, women tend to be discouraged more from the sciences/mathematics fields than men are. However, there's a reason why more women are going into these fields & challenging men in them. Likewise, there are many male nurses, & teachers-professions thought only to be for women.|`|muHctmaGaa	Mabel, promoting that false idea is partly what keeps women from considering the hard sciences in the first place.

We aren't really taught to be interested in those subjects at all. I go to a school with mostly women (literally like 85% female), and my male Economics professor was constantly trying to recruit those of us who got A's in his class to go into economics haha. Also, I think I heard somewhere that men... something with being male... have an interest an building and finding out why things "work". I dont know. But I do think more women are getting interested, a close family friend of mine majored in chemistry. <br>  <br>  and I love quantum physics! Weird you asked this cause I'm watching a video on it and a very enthusiastic young girl is the one presenting! <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2670407799997768291&ei=2zaySbfvN5TuqAKDhuCgCQ&q=quantum+physics&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>   I think we should try to tell young women that this isnt just geeky uninteresting guy stuff.. but other than that, i think numbers are rising and they might eventually even out. <br>  <br>  But then again... I'm a fashion business major... we need more men!! The CEO of Neiman Marcus is a man... but the second you mention "fashion" boys run away.

At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. it's technically for girls buttt i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|4DFTxSBDaa	One technique I've found useful was whenever I think of a bad thought, I would focus very hard on a giant, red, stop sign until the bad thought goes away. This worked really well for me and slowly, I have found that I could bounce back quicker and deal with hard situations without putting myself down.
Olz3goEaaa	There are not nearly as many women in remodeling as men, and we see it as a man's job. I'm not saying it's right, but that's the way most people think because it's what we see so much of.<br>  <br>  <br>  I heard that male nurses have the same trouble.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Yeah, sexism is very pervasive in our society. Guess it's just upbringing. I used to manage a shop and had male employees, customers would quite often assume one of the guys was the manager. I've heard several similar stories from other women.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	It's because you are in what is traditionally a male dominated profession.|`|BkleL3F4aa	are you sure its down to gender?<br>  <br>  i brought mu mother to a hospital the other day to see a relative and the person at the desk looked to her first, it was age before gender.<br>  <br>  <br>  It can be down to demeanor and what you are projecting too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Insight? <br>  <br>  Well, do their opinions really matter?<br>  If they are making the mistake then they are the fools.<br>  You can have the last laugh.<br>  Your partner has to deal with the clients.|`|WKtakdsOaa	I always find people usually talk to the woman especially other women in places like banks and things. It really must be something you  are doing.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	Maybe you are getting to emotional about the Perception of what others think,If your business is doing well then keep your position till you learn all the things you don't know now,later you can strike out on your own,After you learn all there is to know you will automatically exude that sense of competency people detect from a person who knows what they are doing,but don't let petty annoyances derail your life's ambition.remember a brain is a terrible thing to wast,the end result is a manifestation of the brain that conceives the idea and it dosent matter Rather its a woman's or a mans.|`|kxanAkXxaa	That would suck!! but if you're good at it just keep doing your job, the people you deal with will soon realize that you are very good at what you do and give you the respect you deserve :)|`|1wIek546aa	i used to work in a mechanic type shop. with out fail, any one with a question about the outboard engines would ask one of my subordinate males about it. drove me just crazy.<br>  <br>  (they knew what to do though...direct it to me)<br>  <br>  the pay was pretty good, so i was pretty much willing to put up with it.|`|AA10584077	That's frustrating. It seems that you may have discussed this with your partner at some point, though, so maybe you can bring it up again. If I'm speaking out of assumption and you haven't talked about it before, well, now's the time to start. Perhaps you can ask him if he wouldn't be willing to let you have the first word in the conversation with your clients, so that they're more liable to see you as the authority, and him as the assitant. First impressions mean a LOT. That may sound unappealing from his perspective, but as you said, you're the one with all the experience and he still needs to learn the ropes. No one is doing him any favors by pretending that he knows what he's doing.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	Are you perhaps more introverted and quiet in demeanour? I have that too when I go to restaurants with a man. They treat him as the authority but really it is my own fault as I am not a very loud overbearing character. They feel more comfortable dealing with someone a little more socially adroit, I suppose. I think if you are not naturally extroverted and loud, that is how you are treated.
iRKOJhYeaa	I don't think that music is intentionally aimed at men or women, its just that some types of music appeal more to men or women, in general.|`|AA10584077	I don't think so... The only music that I can really describe as "gendered" is that god-awful speed/death/black metal sh*t. A guy who was beat up constantly in middle school grows up, gains 35 pounds of muscle, rips his sleeves off, and brays into a mic while his buddy wails away on an out of tune guitar, and hormonal boys eat it up. No chick worth her salt actually enjoys that crap.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Definitly! Just listen to the lyrics of songs. Most if not all male rappers speak directly to other men. Their message is all about male themes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ice cube summed it up the best! Life ant nothing but bit-ches and money. I'd say that's gender specific.|`|BkleL3F4aa	yes the music i listen to is male dominated...<br>  <br>  i like IDM<br>  <br>  see the link from my 360.|`|CJsKAT27aa	First off - to Abe on an unrelated point, you are most likely just thinking of death metal which is definatly like that, but there is a lot of metal that certainly isn't. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7LcxUiBAa0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7LcxUiBA...</a> < a death metal song, that actually has some tune. <br>  <br>  <<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq8SsCbYazg<" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq8SsCbYa...</a> a thrash metal song, the ending you can hardly call noise, as its poetic :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4uDLvYkf24" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4uDLvYkf...</a> < mixture of screaming and singing<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Not to mention some of the metallica stuff. <br>  <br>  <br>  But otherwise I think music is gendered in a specific way, most females I've met consider metal just all noise, whilst most males I've met like the aggression in it. Not many females listen to music for aggression in it. Also in metal, everyone is trying to outdo eachother, which seems to be a mainly male trait. <br>  <br>  Also, curiously, in the band "disturbed" there are a lot of songs which seem to be directed at, or about a female, but talking from the males point of view. Whilst a lot of slayers lyrics feature violence. <br>  <br>  I think its more what each gender can sympathies with more, along with the aggression in the music appealing to men more.|`|d7a096c7bd6dc367891bf4bc7328e49aaa	I think it is gendered, definetly. Its not often you find that a male rapper or singer or *screamer* write about another male or visa versa with females?|`|3862H0WVaa	Well if you take boy and interestingly girl bands to a lesser extent I doubt you have many male fans. These are marketed towards young females. Indie music isn't I would agree. Rap more male orientated in my opinion as with most rock and heavy metal.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Rap music seems more male oriented, not many women wanna hear about pimp slappin' da bitches..and that sort of thing.<br>  But I'm a total metal head and have been most of my life.<br>  So..idk..I think the lyrics more so than the genre.
DsEEATKSaa	Some children are quite resilient, and show little or no lasting effects following sexual trauma. Factors contributing to resilience include: supportive family/friends, opportunity to talk about the experience, and early professional treatment.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I'm certainly no expert, but know people who were molested as children. Most are deeply affected by it. Someone else may be able to put it to perspective, deal with it and let it be a bad past experience rather than a trauma that they have for years and years. I think it must depend on the individual, the situation itself and their way of compartmentalizing things from their past in order to deal with them better. For some, the trauma of child abuse doesn't affect them until much later in life.It's almost like they have protected themselves from it for so long and then it emerges at another time. I can't imagine it not having some effect on the person.
1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I personally think that one truly good friend you can trust and count on is better than having many friends who are only there when times are good. I guess it differs based on the individual & the persons age. It seems that when you're younger, you have a larger circle of friends that tend to hang out together and have similar interests. I've just found that many of the people we used to call friends are really only acquaintances and few will be there for you when you really need someone. Trust is also a big issue with me and it's hard to find a friend you can really trust & count on to be there no matter what.|`|NTiwPnrYaa	it depends what sort of person you are.<br>  if you are an independant person, you are not going to need as many friends as a, say, self-centered person.|`|d7a096c7bd6dc367891bf4bc7328e49aaa	a few...not too many though cuz that causes problems aka drama.|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	as many as you need to be content, the fewer the better, the truer, the dearer|`|htD82ij1aa	3|`|yfYVrGeEaa	None, because they are not to be trusted.<br>  <br>  The only ones that are going to be with you are your family and even they sometimes, you can't trust.|`|hw8jOWaeaa	1 good friend is better than 10 so so friends|`|AA11222888	It depends on the person, though we all need someone.|`|w5J2B47laa	One or Two is good.<br>  Good friends to trust completely is all you need.
vbjgMBdVaa	Well the big wheel, or a ferris wheel could represent the wheel of life. Pirates are considered to be evil and a woman dressed in all black on it could also be considered bad. I would say this is actually a good dream as odd as that may sound. It could mean the disapearance of something bad in your life or a great change|`|Z5pJ2JNzaa	To dream that you are at the fair, suggests that you may be regressing into your childhood where times were simpler. You feel you can let your inhibitions go and forget about the cultural mores. Also consider the various side shows and arcades as they could symbolize aspects of your personality. Alternatively, the dream may also be a pun on fairness and being fair in a situation or decision<br>  <br>   <br>  Ship <br>  To see a ship in your dream, denotes that you are exploring aspects of your emotions and unconscious mind. The state and condition of the ship is indicative of your emotional state.?If it is a cruise ship, then it suggests pleasant moods. If it is a warship, then you are experiencing feelings of aggression. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are sailing the high seas in a ship, denotes that you are standing tall in times emotional turmoil. <br>  <br>  To dream that a ship crashed or is sinking, suggests that some aspect of your life is out of control. You are expressing some fear or uncertainly within your emotional state. You are afraid of losing something close to you because of certain difficulties. <br>  <br>  To dream that you abandon ship, indicates that you need to move on and let go. An aspect of your emotion is holding you back and it is time to leave it behind. Alternatively, consider the phrase "jumping ship", to indicate changing of sides.|`|LT5HlW3kaa	I have no idea what your dream meant, but that would scare me to death..............|`|UHJHr4efaa	As far as i know when someone dreams of death it means they are unfulfilled and need a change in their lives. the death of an old way of life and the beginning of a new way.|`|BmHzkztYaa	dreams are dreams don't  **** them by interpretations,sometimes  we enjoy dreams  and sometimes not  they are part of a life .whenever one dreamt of he awaked just after that  and this is what  the purpose of dreams may be ...... to make someone awake.
6GmtcZteaa	Nothing badly important here. You can just easily explain what it is that was bothering you to them and hope they would understand why you said what you said. This should really not bother you. Relax and go talk to them theyll understand. Take care :)
rM5Tofhwaa	Don't be a people person.  Be yourself.  You shouldn't feel obligated to change your personality just so you can conform with society.  If you're really having trouble with having people think of you as a disrespectful person, I suggest that think of yourself as an equal to every one else.  I've had this problem because I'm 14 and I considered myself superior because I never realized how intolerable other freshman were when I started high school.  I now learned to deal with other people, but I'm still not a people person.  I wasn't born to please anyone and you weren't either, so there's no reason you should act like you like talking to people. (unless it's a job requirement)  Also, just forget about what you did in the past.  If someone has the right to criticize your personal history, than you have the right to tell them to **** off.  It's as simple as that.  =) hope this helped...
1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I think you should listen to your gut instinct and if he makes you feel creepy, stay away from him. There's obviously something about him that gives you that feeling and a 30 yr old guy should not be "clingy" with a 16 yr old girl. He's not listening to you when you reject him which is a bad sign. Don't answer or return his calls and if I were you I'd avoid being anywhere alone with him. L:isten to your feelings because they are most likely right on.|`|zkovxRseaa	no, make sure he asks you out, then accept, and show up wearing a t-shirt that says "I'm with this disgusting pervert"|`|AA12365169	That sounds creepy to me.<br>  Definitely ignore him and if he keeps bothering you, then talk to someone about it.|`|J7clOCFBaa	It doesn't mean he's creepy, it means he's stubborn and probably an asshole once you get to know him better. And it might  not  be illegal, because you are 16 which in some places is age of consent.|`|yr0UZVZAaa	Tell him you think he's creepy and be honest. If he doesn't leave you alone then just ignore him. I suggest you tell someone, and try to stay safe though cause there are some real creepers out there.|`|4DFTxSBDaa	He's beyond creepy. Is he stalking you? I'm pretty sure this is illegal. protect yourself and get a restraining order.|`|fwdnXIOoaa	Yes he is definitely creepy and he will probably try to take advantage of you now because of your age.  There must be something wrong with him why he can't get a date his own age.  The phrase statutory rape (sex with a minor) comes to mind though I'm not suggesting you have gone that far with him.  Tell him you are really not interested in him and actually he is creeping you out.  Then find a guy your own age who you will have more in common with and can have fun with.  Don't try to grow up too fast, the teenage years will be the best of your life!|`|vvPkBiaoaa	You have a stalker in the making. Cut this off ASAP. Talk to someone that can help you. Maybe this guy is a lonely guy and being clingy may just be normal to him. I'm kinda clingy. But you are too young and when you told him your real age, he should have backed off. Yes this is a sign of something creepy when you turn them down and they still come around. Do your parents or good friends know about this? I'd be careful and cautious with this guy. This could turn into a bad situation. Be careful and let someone with some authority know what is going on. You'll be safer and happier in the long run. <br>  Be Careful!|`|d7a096c7bd6dc367891bf4bc7328e49aaa	I think you should tell somebody...cuz that probably not so safe..|`|f5f2d3714ed144732a196eb42d9458b5aa	I feel like you...there's this 20 year old who likes me and Im 16. I think you should tell him to wait a couple years if he really thinks he likes you.|`|9r9Fk7nhaa	YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY IGNORE HIM! THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
NQEbrRvraa	a dream unifies the body, mind, and spirit. It provides you with insight into ourselves and a means for self-exploration. In understanding your dreams, you will have a better understanding and discovery of your true self (lady bug)|`|8vKrxSYyaa	What is reality?<br>  <br>  <br>  db|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	To this day no one really knows why we dream or their purpose.  Although there are many very important theories and studies on dreams, there are still no real tangible answers.  I am a firm believer in the premise that "there is no reality only perception."  No two people ever experience a situation or event in the same way simply because everyone has different thought processes, experiences, upbringing, genetic make up etc. etc. influencing and forming their perceptions.  As far as dreaming is concerned with perceptual reality, I understand where you're going with this, but dreaming is not reality.  You referred to it yourself as being a different dimension beyond the real world.  Therefore reality does not apply.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Oh no. I can see exactly where you are coming from.<br>  <br>  Just like you said with lucid dreaming. It is quite the amazing thing to have a lucid dream and let your mind play God for awhile. I would agree completely that dreams is our mind playing out it's own picture of reality based on events that had occured, or things you have heard or seen. Another theory could be the mind blowing off steam or it's own little way of expressing itself.<br>  <br>  Yes, I can totally see that working.

pYimIJAWaa	Yes, you are being abused. The threats your mother's boyfriend made to you are probably also illegal (beyond the 'abusing children is illegal', illegal).<br>  <br>  It kind of depends on how old you are and how dependent (financially esp) you are on your mother. If you're old enough to move out, then please start making changes in your life to do so. If you're not old enough to legally move out, please start seeking support for your situation to figure out what can be done for you. <br>  <br>  If you're still in school, try and seek help from a trusted teacher or the guidance counsellor. If you're in a post-secondary program, your school probably has on-campus counselling services that are cheap or free for students. If you're working, especially if you're in a union, your workplace may offer mental health services. Otherwise, contact your local hospital to see what support services are available in your community.<br>  <br>  This help is NOT because there is something inherently wrong with you, but to help counter-act the damage that the abuse is doing to you psychologically. It is also to help you determine what your options are, provide support as you act on your choices, and to provide support and advocacy for you as you transition to a healthier place in your life.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|iEuRY0QXaa	Hell ya.. get out before he changes his mind.|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	You are definitively abused based on what wrote in your question.<br>  Child abuse can take many forms.<br>  One of them is psychological abuse, also known as emotional abuse, Psychological abuse, also referred to as emotional abuse is a form of abuse characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that is psychologically harmful. It involves the willful infliction of mental or emotional anguish by threat, humiliation, or other verbal and non-verbal conduct. It is often associated with situations of power imbalance, such as abusive relationships and child abuse.<br>  Methods of abuse include causing fear by intimidation, threatening physical harm, forcing isolation from family, friends, or school or work.<br>  Victims are frequently in denial about the abuse and are often manipulated into thinking that they are to blame for it. Victims often find it hard to leave an abusive relationship for a variety of reasons, emotional, financial and sometimes religious|`|yfYVrGeEaa	It's definitely abuse, I had a boyfriend that went through that and all he would talk about was how they treated him and ignored him, it weighed heavily on him where he would tell anyone. I call them bad parents, some people should not have children.<br>  <br>  Do you have any relatives you can live with? You will need them.|`|BlUzgH6oaa	It certainly is abuse, and if you don't escape it now, your mind will be so filled with anger that you will not be able to react right in adult life, i.e. inappropriate outbursts. So I hope you can get out, call CPS, or somehow try to change your upbringing. These kind of "parents" ruin good prospective adults for life!|`|ne0EjucSaa	YES go for help!!|`|MAMnNfunaa	It could be verbal abuse. The boyfriend threatening you is wrong and could be arrested for it but you would need Social Services to help you. Tell a teacher or your school counselor or any other School Official that you can trust and they will report it for you to Social Services. Once the report is taken they will come to your school and ask you some questions then based on that they will make a decision on whether you should be removed from the home. You will be asked if there is a relative that you are willing to live with. If not then they will probably try to counsel you and your mother and her boyfriend and if that fails then you will be put in foster care.<br>  <br>  Abuse is taken very seriously so talk to someone like your school counselor or teacher before thinking about reporting your mom and boyfriend to Social Services.|`|pnVTblksaa	Please talk to a school counselor or an advocate, this sounds very abusive and not only do you need to get help but it sounds like they need intervention as well.  Nobody deserves this treatment, please don't keep silent do yourself a favor and seek help, you are sooo worth it!!!!

Architecture too is affected, not to the same extent as it is by Greek/Roman styles, but still, obelisks and pyramids (egyptian based) can be found in all parts of the world.

The oldest Clovis sites are in the American Southeast and many are in the Chesapeake region. <br>  <br>  Some have suggested that Clovis is less a people then a technology that quickly spread through the Americas.<br>  <br>  The Clovis Point has no predecessors in Asia. It's a purely American invention. The closest point that resembles it is the Solutrean points from Spain. However, there's a 5,000 year gap between the Solutrean and Clovis cultures. As a measurement think of the gap between us and the pyramid builders. Last the Solutrean's have not been shown to have deep water or even a marine technology.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	The first answer seems to have a bias toward melanin.  Australians are no closer related to blacks (removed actual name of race) than are caucasions (how stupid is that that YA won't allow the technical name for a race in Anthropology, political correctness run amok and I won't use African American because they are a race not a continent).  Melanin is not preserved in fossil bones.  He is right though that the apparent race of the people seems to be most closely associated with present day Ainu and polynesians.  The clovis points don't seem to come from Asia.  They seem to come from Europe.  Some Native Americans obviously don't particularly like this for political reasons|`|HlxjmFh0aa	The Clovis point tools appear to have come from Northern Spain or Southern France some 20,000 yrs ago.  The fact that Mt haplogroup X (DNA) is found along the East coast of the Americas & in Europe, but not in Asia, further strengthens the hypothesis that they followed the Atlantic Ice to the Americas during the last glacier max.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_X_(mtDNA)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_...</a><br>  While scientifically correct, this is not politically correct.<br>  I've included a link to the Solutrean Hypothesis that gives arguements supporting travel to the Eastern Americas from Western Europe.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutrean_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutrean_h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/saf/1406/features/dna.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/saf/1406/features/dna...</a>|`|5oUyPxuuaa	Jim has some interesting points but i think he may have missed the main mark to the answer. very little is known about the Clovis hunters mainly because they would have stuck to the coastal regions during the travel south out of Alaska and Canada (at least in one theory). because of this and raising sea levels most of the sites that would hold information are now under very deep water. to get an idea of how deep. look at a map of North America that shows the continental shelf. That used to be beach front property. this is where the sites would be. however after time and melted ice they are buried under alluvial deposits and deep under water. <br>  <br>  Another problem that occurs is the decay of the cultural material. typically all you find on a site that is deemed a Clovis site is just that a Clovis point. there really is not much more. rarely will you find more than that. in Central Pennsylvania there is a site called Shoop that does not fit this pattern. It is a paleolithic site that seems to have a cache of 10 to 20 fluted points that may fall into the category of Clovis. <br>  <br>  there are many things we don't know about these people and it is just a matter of time until we find the right site or sites to figure out just who they were.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	The existence of their stone tools in North America proves that they arrived here, from Europe,  before the the North American Indians arrived from Asia.

IpD7Gqieaa	Get some healthy self esteem :)|`|dMmeVi5zaa	Ive had this same problem too. You should hang with the "popular" kids however you DONT have to drink, do drugs or have sex. Dont think that just because you hang with them means you have to do those things too. Do those things only when you are ready and know what you are getting into. And becasue you may not partake in those things with the "popular" kids they will respect you for what you have been through and will know that you are a good friend.|`|4DFTxSBDaa	First of all, do u want to be popular? Popular isn't doing drugs or getting pregnant, the popular kids are people that everyone wants to hang around. The popular kids are all nice to others and confident. It sounds like your mom is pressuring you. Have a mature talk with your mom and straighten things out. After all, she is your mom. I give you a standing ovation for surviving cancer.|`|d7a096c7bd6dc367891bf4bc7328e49aaa	don't listen to your mom, do what YOU want to do...don't get yourself down because you wont do what other people tell you to do. Think for yourself and be yourself because if you don't, you're gonna spend the rest of your life doing what others want you to do.|`|UM527qlDaa	I'm in the same situation I think. I have some friends, acquaintances rather, and I never hang out or do anything with them because they never invite me out. I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, and I don't have a problem hangout out with people who do as long as they are good people.<br>  What you should do is just be yourself and find some friends who will like you for being you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
4DFTxSBDaa	I used to be very antisocial. Now I love being in the center of attention and being social with others. How? I just realized that you gotta take risks. Start by being nice to others, smiling, and respecting others. Take more risks, talk to others and you'll make lots of friends. Most socialists have good manners, optimistic views, and are fun to be with. I can't tell you how to make this transition exactly because you have to discover it on your own. But, confidence is key =)|`|79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	start small. say join groups or do stuff where you don't have to talk much but other people are around. try and stay positive. happy music , movies etc.
vWo8EPAYaa	Graphology, the personality test that is supposed to figure out your personality by analyzing your personality, is actually a pseudoscience, meaning that it's not really credited. It's no use trying to measure your personality by graphology, honestly. It's better to go to a psychologist and have them run a few tests, if it's really that important to you.|`|4a4795e43d693be3aa7146aa0989ea2daa	A sheet?<br>  <br>  There are many handwriting books.<br>  ANy ruled paper will measure the sizes of the uppercase and lower case letters.

OdoLSDlXaa	It depends.  The most common related experience is volunteering for a suicide hotline.  Working in a psychiatric hospital as a tech or floor staff is great experience.  Working as a SpEd teachers assistant is good experience.  Basically anything related to the field of mental health even if it were being a secretary at a mental health agency would be seen as good experience.
WBBJy9Udaa	In most jurisdictions in the U.S., if he's 17, it should be legal.<br>  <br>  Still, be careful, and I would advise against the choking. He could die, and it would be horrible to kill this little kid over a mere fantasy. If you want to tie him up and do some other BDSM stuff, that's fine, but take it easy on the extreme sex.<br>  <br>  Just be honest with him. I bet he's dying to have you. ;) I'd just go with whipping, slapping or a strap-on sex instead of choking. Be safe and have fun. :)|`|79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	ask him straight up and include detail. esp mention the strap on cos some guys might not be into that. then you give him time to think about it. days at least<br>  He will need a safeword so that you know when to stop and that he is serious about stopping.<br>  Try orange for if hes uncomfortable and red means stop.<br>  both of you need to be sober. I would advise against the choking as this is often known as edgeplay as its dangerous and can go wrong unless you are experienced.|`|sly7ATJNaa	Try to find a movie that hints towards these kinds of fantasies and then when the time is appropriate, ask him what he thinks about it!|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	When you are testing the waters with regards to sexuality, always try to do somehting similar to the fantasy you are interested in with the person you are interested in.<br>  <br>  in other words, if your fantasy involves wearing a french maid's outfit, taking every opportunity to make sensual, yet playful, remarks in french whenever the topic of cleaning comes up, and gauging their reaction, is the best way to see indirectly how they might respond to you.<br>  <br>  In this case, I would try being more 'aggressive' in other aspects of your friendship. Since you want to dominate him in your fantasy, warm him up by 'dominating' him in your friendship. Make aggressive remarks about things that he does, pick up a piece of rope and mention how cute he would look hogtied or tied spread eagle. The more responsive he is with each mention, the more aggressive you can push it, until you can come right out and tell him what you'd like to do to him.<br>  <br>  And if he turns very cold and strange after bringing it up, then you know that that's something best explored with someone else, or best explored later in the friendship/relationship. Sometimes, presentation has a lot of influence on how we react to something. A poorly made chocolate cake (when you like chocolate cake) might not taste as good as a very well-made lemon meringue pie (which you hate lemon.)|`|CEg0ol6maa	My advice is don't do it YET...wait until he is older and more mature.A relationship is not just about fulfilling your sexual fantasies but its deeper than that.I know it sounds cliche but you really have to look at your relationship and say, "Well beyond the sex, what do I actually like about this guy?"|`|rtRGr1o7aa	I know how you feel, wanting to ask a question but being to scared that the person you ask will say no or worse tell people you asked, but i think you should ask but ask him to come over and ask him when you two are alone it takes away a lot of pressure but I think you should ask him!Good luck!|`|6fb7392757c2cda50b13cf240bc7aed7aa	Have you ever heard the term 'Don't Corrupt The Innocent'? He is awfully young and to introduce him to this kind of stuff might be overwhelming and you might be creating a monster and you don't want that on your conscience do you? He may still be a virgin with limited sexual exposure and this kind of behavior could indoctrinate him into some heavy alternative sex world that his mind may not be ready for and it may become a life long habit that eventually messes him up. I would just keep those thoughts in your head and don't act them out. Be a good friend and leave the fantasy where it belongs in your head,he is too young and although he may be of legal age of consent he is probably way too immature to match wits with you and it could get out of hand real fast .|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Thats illegal.

xOduTscPaa	Dreams are weird that way. When something has so much of an impact on you like that its only natural that it will affect you you cant even escape your own dreams. Dreams reflect whats inside and who you are. Maybe you have some repressed memory that awakened in your dreams when viewing the movie it happens. I had a similar dream for a while about being left behind only to awake to despair and nothingness and desertion. Maybe the idea just scared you so much that it doesntwant to be forgotten. I hope this helps because i had to really get help and let it go, when 28 days later came out i was really young, im still young now but i know this because i had the same problem. As time passes it will fade, if it doesn't message me i will try to help and if i can't help you you might need professional help. Anyways just let time run its course, after all as i have learned it is just a movie.
B5KR2Yjlaa	If you keep having the same dream every night (which is called a recurring dream) it means that you're unconscious is trying to tell you something. Pay attention to anything in dream- how you feel, colors, symbols and look it up in a dream dictionary because a recurring dream always has a deeper meaning and shouldn't be disregarded

LYhiCV4saa	Hi, Athren. The way I face a challenge really depends on what the particular challenge is. If a task obliges me to extend my abilities and efforts somewhat, then that's ok- everyone needs challenges like that sometimes. <br>  <br>  However, I'm not one of those people who sees every difficulty in life as a "challenge" and "opportunity". I get rather annoyed at people who mouth platitudes about God not giving people more challenges than they can handle or who suggest that prayer or believing in oneself is the answer to all of life's difficulties. Some even say "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger"- yes, well, sometimes it leaves you maimed for life instead. I've often seen those sorts of unthinking responses here on Y!A and I think they grossly underestimate the sorts of problems that some people face. <br>  <br>  Many people- for example, those with life-threatening illnesses, serious disabilities, who live in war zones, who suffer natural disasters, etc- are not in a position to do much to change their circumstances, at least without considerable help. To call their difficulties "challenges" that they should somehow overcome by working harder or thinking positively or adopting some other glib solution is simplistic and cruel.  <br>  <br>  So, to finally answer your question, I suppose it all comes down to semantics: to how you define the word "challenge". If by "challenge" you mean a "difficult but achievable task", then I suppose a combination of hard work, self-discipline and determination usually does the trick for me.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|mOXOfDdRaa	I perceive "a challenge" as an opportunity to learn rather than "overcome". If you are consistently presented with the same opportunity than you are obviously not learning from it and will be presented with it time and time again until you do.|`|KH3kbRjgaa	I often equate challenges like waves on an ocean.

QMAqzpKEaa	It's important to point out that, however you attempt to excuse it, this inability to accept BDSM into the feminist dialogue is really just a form of kinkophobia, a widely accepted prejudice against the practice of power-exchange sex. Patrick Califia, writer and advocate of BDSM pornography and practice, wisely states that "internalized kinkophobia is the unique sense of shame that many, if not most, sadomasochists feel about their participation in a deviant society." This hatred of self can be particularly strong among feminist submissives, when an entire community that they identify with either dismisses their desires or pegs them as unwitting victims.<br>  <br>  Despite this deliberate journey of self-discovery and the accompanying (and perhaps contradictory) feelings of being in total control, it's pretty evident that the feminist movement at large is not really ready to admit that women who like to be hit, choked, tied up and humiliated are empowered.<br>  <br>  Sadly, claims of sexual emancipation do not translate into acceptance for submissives -- the best a submissive can hope for is to be labeled and condescended to as a damaged victim choosing submission as a way of healing from or processing past trauma and abuse.<br>  <br>  Whether or not it's difficult to accept that the desire to be demeaned is not a product of a society that seeks to objectify women, I would argue that, regardless of appearance, by its very nature BDSM is constantly about consent. Of course, its language and rules differ significantly from vanilla sexual scenes, but the very existence of a safe word is the ultimate in preventing violation -- it suggests that at any moment, regardless of expectations or interpretations on the part of either party, the act can and will end. Ignoring the safe word is a clear act of violation that is not up for any debate. Because of this, BDSM sex, even with all its violent connotations, can be much "safer" than non-safe-word sex. While not very romantic in the traditional sense, the rules are clear -- at any moment a woman (or man) can say no, regardless of the script she (or he) is using.<br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question, yes, it's normal but the female sexual submissive scares some people, as they see her as a victim, when she is actually consenting and enjoying her experience. She is, in fact, empowered. <br>  <br>  There is a guilt and shame among women who have fantasies of their own violation and express a desire to be demeaned. There is no need for that guilt.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	not exactly sure what you mean by the worse way an its none of my business . but, the world is full of people with a variety of turn ons. there are thousands of people who like being submissive in one form or another thats one of the reasons that there are so many bd sm sites . i think as long as no one is injured physically or mentally its cool. one of the things that came out of the kinsey and masters and johnson work is that we like all kinds of things.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	I worry about people's desire to be 'normal'. So long as you aren't a sociopath who enjoys having sex with dead bodies (especially ones you kill), normal is really overrated.<br>  <br>  I like to think of sexual tastes as being like fruits and vegetables. No two people make a salad out of the exact same ingredients or to the exact same degree as another person, which means that it isn't so much whether or not the salad is good for you as it is how you go about enjoying it.<br>  <br>  This is true for sexual submission fantasies, in both men and women. Some fantasies are actually self-destructive acts of a damaged mind, especially when they are engaged in a reckless manner, which brings me back to my point about how one goes about fulfilling a fantasy. Having a fantasy of being tied up (for instance) can be erotic in one sense (if the guy you are attracted to is doing it to you) and destructive in another (if some stranger breaks in and does it to you.) Context and execution are really what determines how good or bad a fantasy is for the person.<br>  <br>  There are even ways to 'safely' engage in many extreme forms of sexual behavior, but they require vast amounts of communication and preparation. A fantasy is most dangerous when it is acted on with little thought of the consequences. It's not so much about what is 'good' or 'bad' or 'normal' or 'abnormal' so much as it is about how you go about achieving it.|`|AA10635683	Certainly, my dear.  It is the nature of estrogen to desire to be acted upon.  Just avoid anything sinful, and you'll be fine.  You're perfectly normal.|`|LFC1AcmGaa	Yes|`|e7SYtaIJaa	Ummm, where do u live again?
t5Nrj6Txaa	It sounds like you took advantage of this girl and are sorry that she is no longer your "puppet".  If you stopped thinking about yourself for once, you would realize that she's not coming to you begging you for your friendship.  Perhaps this means the best thing you can do is leave her alone.  Certainly, you can apologize if you want, but realize that certain things, such as trust, can't often be fixed when broken.
lwG6tvOqaa	I have had way too many weird dreams to name, but i will give you one that just popped into my head when i was reading other people's responses. <br>  <br>  Last year, i had a dream that i was at someone's house, and my grandpa(A 59 year old man that is over six feet tall and big) and Timbaland (Yes the producer) were sitting on the couch in the living room. It was kind of dark in there. Aaliyah was there, but she was shorter, and she looked fatter, because since she was short,like dwarf short, her fat was packed onto her little body. All of a sudden, i felt the urge to pick  her up, so i did, and was holding her like a little baby, and she felt like she weighed 10 pounds. While holding her, i said, "Your baby girl for real now!"She laughed, and i put her back down.<br>  <br>  Timbaland and my grandpa just looked at each other with smiles on their faces. My grandpa said that he was going to pick me up, so i would know what it felt like. He said that i had nerve calling someone else small when i was only a size 1 jeans.<br>  <br>  Then, i had to leave, so i packed up my gamecube and school books, and put them into my pink bookbag. The whole time, i was complaining about not wanting to go back to school. <br>  <br>  When i woke up, i remembered that the next day, winter break would be over and i would have to go back to school.|`|gUg300Mmaa	The weirdest dream I had is: when some one asked me what I did for a living I responded that I was a secret agent for God.  And when they asked what exactly that meant I said it meant I was ' like a secret spy for religion'.<br>  <br>  I am a Unitarian Universalist and I was not raised in any particlar religion.|`|o4QRCMueaa	Theirs been so many wired ones, but I'll give you a scary one I had over a year ago.<br>  So I was at school and getting out of math class so I went out of the class and bumped into a few friends. Then I went down the stairs and when I got to the bottom a good friend of mien ran into me and he was tiring to tell me something, but I couldn't understand him for some reason.  then I looked around and I was in this red room and so I looked to my left and there was a mirror as big as the wall  and I could see my reflection. I looked at my reflect and found my left eye was missing and I was holding it in my right hand. I could see everything on my eye all of the nerve roots and what not and my clothing was covered in blood as well it was a little freaky. <br>  Then I woke up sweating in my bed.|`|Ewosh9pTaa	I dreamt that I was doing a romantic tango with a beaver, only I suddenly realised his fur smelt of old coach seats, I asked him why and he smiled. I then realised his teeth were made of the souls of dead babies that had died choking on their mother's amniotic fluid. The beaver told me not to "sweat the small stuff" as he made me a cocktail of this fluid mixed with the rabid tears of a hundred 50 year old prom queen's destined to masturbate old priests into MacDonald's vanilla milkshake cups.<br>  It was a heavy dream... but hey, you asked.|`|yazZH4khaa	OMG I have this reoccurring dream that I am in school only in my underwear and I cannot get out of the school. I wake up very grateful that I am in my bed- lol, but true story.|`|26LZAOWraa	i had one <br>  about pens|`|8aL1bsi3aa	I dreamt that I was in church, but instead of chairs there were spread out booths like in a restaurant.<br>  I think everybody was eating but I'm not sure.<br>  I looked to my right at the booth diagonal from me and My Chemical Romance was sitting there.<br>  The guitarist was giving me annoyed looks after a while because I kept looking at them in amazement.<br>  Then my best friend's little brother went up and sang in a choir with a bunch of other little boys. After they were done, I ran down the aisle to hug him... making sure MCR would see me.<br>  Then after church was over, I went outside and it was outside of my school at night.<br>  I walked in front of the gym, and no one was around me.<br>  Then the drummer of MCR came running out of the gym doors with a pack of wolves and I tried taking a picture of him and all of a sudden it was actually a wolf taking a picture of him?<br>  He yelled at the wolf who was then me again and I got scared and just left.<br>  The end.|`|uXCbP6bDaa	I have two. The first one I wrote down when I woke up on February 7 2009. I remember seeing an ocean and I was swimming in it. With me was a girl I didn't know, this guy Alex I've been flirting with and some other guy. I remember they were I think like mermaid kind of people and we were swimming from where I lived to this island sort of thing. The places were exactly like they were where I live now. We were at this roller rink near me and I remember everybody was sitting off the rink and everyone was worried. I saw a screen against the farthest wall. It was this pale lady with wrinkles and black hair. She was saying she was going to kill all of us if we didn't let her kill pandas? Then I remember the next day my friend and I were going to Alex's house and they were gone. I remember seeing a rubber frog and squeezing it. A grandpa who had bought the house was there with his wife. He said something about being bit by a spider.<br>  <br>  The second I had a few nights ago. My friend Nick was in it. My ex boyfriend Brady was also in it. I was dating Brady though and they were step brothers. Nick has a step brother in real life. We were sitting in their living room with their parents. I remember we were discussing something very bad. Then there were people trying to burst our door open and they were after them not me. I saw red lights outside and a black helicopter. I woke up after.|`|n9d7dWaAaa	I'll never forget this dream. I was like 7 years old at the time...it was soo weird...lol.<br>  <br>  So basically, my family was running some newspaper thing and they were printing newspaper. I somehow meet that guy from Star Trek/Star Wars (he's red and black, and i think he's evil) So he uses the light saber thingies and he tries to touch people with them and they turn like flat, like football head and 2d. It's really weird, so he's just like running after me all this time and I think when I finally got tapped, I woke up!<br>  <br>  THE WEIRDEST PART: My mom was sleeping on the edge of my bed where my feet were, she was kinda on it. I looked at her and she looked exactly the same, EXCEPT SHE HAD THAT RED+BLACK THINGY as her skin! I was so freaked out that I tried reaching for the phone, But she twitched, and i got so scared. But i looked back at her and she was normal again :)|`|1cvGYL4Oaa	in all my dreams it feels like i'm walking through molasses. every night, i have a task that i'm supposed to complete but everything moves so slow and i never get anything done and then my frustration causes me to wake up.
7b30cd2ddc0ec6ae3f9c56fb6cce9ff1aa	I'm only an amateur psychologist and so what I say will be purely speculative, but I do believe there is a clear possibility. Perhaps you don't feel that you can build a personality or a self with material possessions. Maybe the clothing that you wear helps you feel like you have a defined personality that is easier to maintain than possessing genuinely positive character traits. I would say this is common and not at all healthy. You might be better off engaging in a little bit of introspection. Figure out who it is you are and I will bet that you will be able to walk through the mall without buying a single thing. In fact, you may not even want to ever visit a mall again if you manage to find yourself.|`|cVwf11dRaa	its all in you're head and i think you can easily refrain yourself from doing it, take up more hobbies get you're mind off you're problem although if you have the money to buy all that stuff go for it but you will stop buying everything once you're broke this will send an emotional signal to you're brain and whenever you see a store again you wont even think about it because of the previous outcome|`|daDJrtcvaa	not to be rude or disrespectful but your disorder could be greed or selfishness,instead of buying try donating,you'll be spending and buying with compassion, not disorder. i'm not a doctor.
GutYNu9baa	Not worried Just don't want to be there when it happens!|`|XkmqZ07Daa	105 natural causes|`|Ewosh9pTaa	When I stop feeling any hope for the future for more than 1 year.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Around the same time as my husband and quickly.|`|luTfdMETaa	that's hard,eh id at least like to be past my 20's(i try remember that when i think wacko lol) and i dunno some sort of suicide. x|`|d02gJC1aaa	bullet to the head.  asap?|`|9lT4e8Efaa	When Im old, after living a full, happy, healthy and fabulous life. I think just not waking up would be the nicest way to die, preferably I would have achieved all I ever wanted, fallen in love and had a brilliant life x|`|JWDfOTX2aa	I want to die in a plane crash when i'm in my thirties. I have know idea why i want that, but 've thought about it before.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	95 or something like that if not science had found a way to keep me fit longer. I think freezing to death might be good or some nice drugs.|`|1cvGYL4Oaa	i guess cancer, i know a lot of people who died of cancer.|`|9THK1iWTaa	I'm bloody dead already man!<br>  Are you blind?<br>  <br>  Silence!<br>  I keeel you!
lDXh0jRVaa	Perhaps take this time to write a few letters. Since you sound genuinely sorry I'm sure that your friends will forgive you. Girls usually appreciate a hand-written letter so take some time to write one to all the girls you think you were a jerk to. They will probably think you are the sweetest guy for doing that. Your guy friends probably could care less about a letter but go talk to them on Monday and tell them that you never meant to be a jerk but recent events made you think that maybe you came off that way and that you want to apologize if that's how they took it. Promise everyone to make an effort to be nicer and invite them to tell you when you're being a jerk so you know exactly what you have to work on. <br>  Anyway, things always have a way of working themselves out. You'll see that next weekend this won't seem near as much of a big deal and that things will go back to normal. I'm so glad you realized this personality problem yourself because now you can work on it. Don't worry, EVERYONE has something to work on. Personally, I'm very sarcastic and opinionated so I come across as a very abrasive person though I don't mean to. <br>  Good luck and feel better!|`|8aL1bsi3aa	Well... when stuff like that happens to me and it's the weekend... I imagine how I will patch things up.<br>  What I will say to people, how I will act towards them.<br>  And keep imagining in my head that everything will work out.<br>  It usually takes me all weekend to think of the perfect things... so that should keep you busy!<br>  And don't think negative things! =P<br>  lol|`|cVwf11dRaa	as soon as you see her tell her you're the jerk and maybe some other **** this would make her feel like you agree with her then apologize again shell see that you've realized youre mistake(even thought yough didnt mean to piss her off) and she'll like you again for it|`|UjtyuSaSaa	While it's not okay to be a jerk, you didn't mean to, and your friends will understand if you confront them about it.|`|r1aAWC3Maa	Say to her "Listen. I never ment to hurt you. I know that you think I'm a jerk, but I never ment to call you a jerk, I was only trying to tease you and it went the wrong way and I'm sorry and I wish that you could forgive me for everything and foget that day. Now if you don't want to I understand, I just hope for the best because I really care about you." <br>  <br>  I hope I could help.. You don't sound like a jerk to me.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Isn't it strange how sometimes people don't take things the way they are intended?  I have the same problem with joking and have learned (after several years and mistakes) to be careful with words.  Some people are more sensitive than others.<br>  You know what you have to do...apologize sincerely and try to curb your wit a little.  It'll be fine;  you're learning!
QMAqzpKEaa	A blessing to you because you found out what she was doing in time and you did not waste any more time and energy on her.<br>  You still sound hurt and bitter. <br>  She can live with her bad karma.<br>  She's not your problem.<br>  You move on.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	I would describe such a person as Clintonesque.
yazZH4khaa	Find a way to turn your thought patterns around. Communication is the key to finding the way out from your current feelings. My Prayers are there for you. <br>   Go to a hospital and visit the children's area where they are dying from cancer, or help someone and get out of your own head; stinking thinking needs to be eliminated. Smile!|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	I'm so sorry you feel this way.  I hate parts of my life too. I wish I had some comforting words for you.  I hate to point people to websites, but abbeypress.com has some beautiful words of comfort.  It's a gift site, but it's run by monks.  Good luck and best wishes.  I wish there was more I could do.|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	You hate your life?<br>  Take a look around you and inside yourself see what you don't like and change it.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Guess what! I hate your life too!|`|Ewosh9pTaa	Why?<br>  No-one is totally happy with theirs either.<br>  But HATE is a strong word.<br>  Can you step back and look at why, and what might be small steps to change it?<br>  If not, then try to change your consciousness with booze and soft drugs to gain an insight.|`|AA11952133	Figure out what you hate about your life.  (Don't say everything, lol)  Then ask yourself what you wish you were doing.  Then go online and see what you have to do to get into it.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and try small things first, big changes are harder.|`|7AY3gQ4Iaa	If you hate your life so much why dont you look at what you can change about it and go for it, whats stopping you ?<br>  :-)|`|n9d7dWaAaa	All I can do it LOL at this.<br>  What the heck?|`|kGiwteWgaa	way to stay positive good sir|`|RW566BSUaa	Good for you?|`|1cvGYL4Oaa	when is st. patricks day?|`|bljEhh86aa	join the club.|`|AA10292836	WELL CHANGE IT!

Nothing justifies beating up on someone, especially nothing as insignifigant as a disagreement over a musical group.  Do you hear yourself?/  If your anger is so on the surface like that, maybe a trip to a councelor or psychiatrist is in order.  At least visit your family doctor.  You obviously have other deep rooted anger issues not related to something like that.  You may need some therapy to get to the root of your problems and maybe even some medication in the beginning to calm you down.  Meanwhile sit still in a quiet dark place, close your eyes and be still.  Focus on your breathing and take very long, slow breathes.  Breathe in the good, blow out the bad.  Slowly do this over and over for as long as it takes to calm down.  You may start looking forward to this little bit of peace in your day and start feeling better...best wishes
8aL1bsi3aa	It's because another thing you had been looking forward to has come and passed... and you're aware that it will always be like this.<br>  =)|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	You feel this way because the fun you gained during the hunt, is brief, and will eventually ware off, the depression you feel may be because you have to go back to school indeed or could be something totally different, however the depression will typically always sink back in and last longer than the excitement/euphoric sensations you felt during the activity, typically you will need to find the problem causing the depression, and address it, unlike the adrenaline euphoric, and fun sensations you received, anything that is casing the depression will not go away, hence the depression will not go away, until you address it.  This could be linked to school, as I have found myself to in that position, e.g. a really good weekend, then, Monday you have to go back to work, after the loud partying, or in your case, gun fire-when all goes quiet, when you are alone, that depression will typically, always come back and hit you in the face.

QMAqzpKEaa	You cannot actually do that easily. However, the closest that I have come to thinking of nothing was during meditation classes. Even then, I was concentrating on my breath so I was thinking of my breath.<br>  The meditation classes took place in a Buddhist centre so some of the above answers would tie in with what I experienced. You do not have to be a Buddhist to practice meditation though. It's very relaxing.<br>  I bought a cd from the centre and practice breathing out, as if breathing out black puffs of smoke (negative energy) so as I breathe out, I am thinking of black smoke. As I breath in, I am thinking of pure white light (positive energy). So you see, one cannot stop thinking easily even through meditation.<br>  I think a master of meditation, who has practiced and perfected themselves, can think of nothing. I still cannot.|`|Pdex43zgaa	I think this is the base concept of Buddhism|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Really easy, if you're an American teenager <br>  <br>  ...

I will just be sitting there.|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	It's possible to think of nothing.<br>  Our thoughts have endless possibilities so yes!|`|yazZH4khaa	Most definitely because our brains are built to think whether we like it or not- lol.|`|vvPkBiaoaa	it's meditating. you can actually think of a "void" either white or black light. I think this is technically thinking of nothing. A void is nothing, right? Dreaming is NOT thinking either. These are electronic pulses sending images to your brain. You are not conscious, so technically you are THINKING of nothing when you dream. Your conscious mind thinks, the subconscious shows you things, but not necessarily by choice. when your brain breaths and performs it's normal activities, you are NOT conscious of them. Therefore, this cannot be considered "thinking". Your brain would continue to do these functions if every other part of your brain was destroyed, but the parts that control body functions, that is existence, not life or therefore ":thinking".|`|7b30cd2ddc0ec6ae3f9c56fb6cce9ff1aa	This is a matter of what philosophers like to call "intentionality." It is not possible to think of nothing because in order to be conscious all of your thoughts must be about something. All of your thoughts have intentions and these are the way that you are able to create a personality and interact with the world. Every thought that you have is based on stored experiences that continually compound each other. When you are angry, you have to be angry about something. When you are sad, you must be sad about something. If you had no thoughts you would no longer be working on a conscious or subconscious level and if you were no longer active in either state of consciousness there would be no "you" at all.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Are you talking about thinking in terms of an activity seperate from sensory processing (while my hair is drying, I am thinking of what to wear tonight) or are we talking about thinking that coincides with sensory processing so that it doesn't make itself noticed?<br>  <br>  We think because we have senses and memory banks. The senses create parameters, the memory banks allows us to cross-check those parameters with other parameters, past or future.<br>  <br>  To not think at all would be to be brain/organism dead, since even a spirit processes sensations. What you, and most people, are looking for is a way to not deviate from sensory processing. In other words, while you are taking a bath, all your thoughts and actions revolve around that activity only. Your foot passes under the faucet, cold water is coming out, your feet get cold, you turn up the hot water. In that regard, thinking and action 'harmonize' to the point that you would actually have to 'think' about the situation seperately in order to be able to notice you are doing it.<br>  <br>  But this is more of a philosophy question than psychological.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	I don't think you can think of nothing.<br>  <br>  Because what is nothing?<br>  <br>  Everything is something.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in nothing.<br>  <br>  And your brain is always thinking, not conciously, but about breathing and heart rate etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|22eb312dbb14b4b8f995bc33606eb782aa	Yes.  It is the ideal of Buddhism and it is also very hard to do.  Focusing on the breath is how you start learning it.  But the idea is to clear and quiet the mind.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Yes, and no. You can, with discipline, learn to quite your inner dialog but you can never not think. Your brain will unconsciously keep your heart beating, lungs breathing...etc.|`|5580828d87e34f27c0a85291cf4a20c4aa	Its called meditation practised in yoga and buddism i believe|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	Be careful because if you think of nothing, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man will come to get you!|`|cVwf11dRaa	its impossible to think of nothing. One of the founding fathers of psychology, William James said that the mind is a constant flow of consciousness this means that every thought is linked to another so you will never stop thinking only in your sleep you are unaware of it. And your sister is right in comas you do dream usually in the REM (rapid eye movement stage of sleep) so lets say you get waken up early int he morning you will most likely be able to recall most of your dreams.|`|7AY3gQ4Iaa	Well me and my friend did this some years back. <br>  We were both at college and had that many thoughts going through  our heads that we decided to sit and concentrate for bout ten minutes to completely clear all thoughts out of our heads, which we managed to do with success.<br>  However, its 6 years later and i struggle to get a thought in my head. I have to concentrate to get anything in my head its really frustrating.<br>  I really suggest you not to do it because have you ever said anything without thinking. Well imagine doing that constantly. Not Good!!!|`|fwiPSj5waa	I don't think so
7b30cd2ddc0ec6ae3f9c56fb6cce9ff1aa	I know where you're coming from. In fact, based on what I've read, heard, and just general experience I can say with confidence that you are far from being alone, rather you are in very good company. Firstly, I would imagine that whether you are fully consciously aware of it or not, you are probably very stressed about not only this situation, but questions pertaining to your value as a human being, your future in regards to an occupation and making a living or choosing a college and major etc... I would like to point out that asking these questions is a very good thing. Many people do not ask themselves where they will be in five years, who they really are as a person, and what they have to offer other people. Asking these questions is the first step to understanding what you want and achieving it. The response of many people on this website I can already anticipate will be the stock response of "Go find a hobby or club to get involved with." You and I both understand that your problems run deeper than that and can't be solved by picking up a hobby and gaining a few extra superficial relationships. However, the reason people give these ridiculous stock answers is that it is actually very difficult to solve the problem that you have, which is mild depression. I'll try to give you some advice, but I don't have all the answers for alleviating this vicious cycle you're in, either. The silver lining here is that you seem to understand that a real friendship is more valuable than a superficial friendship; this sounds like common sense but you would be surprised just how many people are willing to put on a mask and sell fraudulent versions of themselves to so-called friends in order to avoid loneliness. Because you have this understanding, you will understand when I tell you that better days are ahead. At 17, it's extremely difficult in this culture to find friends that are authentic. I've found these on occasion in college and it's almost strange to discover that genuine people do exist and with them conversation is easy. You do not need to have an exciting life or many eccentric personality traits for these people you will meet every once in a while. Conversation with them will come completely naturally and you will be shocked at just how interesting you find yourself to be around them. Unfortunately, I won't lie and say that you will meet many of these people who are willing to be genuine. It's tough to find, and to be perfectly honest, the most genuine friends I've met all seem to smoke marijuana or take hallucinogens. Keep your head up.|`|vvPkBiaoaa	Becoming a young adult is a very unsettling time for most. There is a lot of pressure on you at that time. Become an adult, take care of your responsibilities, go out into the world. This can be very overwhelming. Rest assured that this is normal and most young adults feel the same way. You are not alone. Being unsure of things at this time in your life is normal too. You are growing into an adult, and there is a lot of uncertainty. This is a time in your life when you are discovering who you really are, what you can accomplish and what you want to do with the rest of your life. It's stressful and at times it can feel like nothing you do is right, and there is nowhere you can turn to make things easier. But pieces of these things will start to fall into place. These things get easier to deal with. When you get to be older and want to start a family of your own, things get crazy again, but in different ways. Life is a struggle to be embraced. All these stressful, uncertain times will teach you about life and how to deal with different situations. Keep your chin up, and just push through all the crap, because there IS a light at the end of the tunnel! Hang in there. Things will get easier.|`|hH6LTbEtaa	Well your life is better than mine then !<br>  Im a 16 year old girl, im stuck at home with no friends because i live out in the countryside. I left school at 13 so have no GCSE's. My dad died when i was 7 and my mum prefers to be with my 22 year old sister. So if you think your life is bad think about mine.|`|8LyR0efpaa	Your question is extremely perceptive, and you are living proof that people see things differently, depending on their perspective.  Most of these "other people" whose lives you are jealous of, have exactly the same situation that you do.  You think they are interesting people, but if you asked many of them to describe themselves, they would tell you exactly the same things you have said in your question:  that their lives are boring, that they just sit at home and don't do anything interesting, and that they are swamped with work and don't have time for activities.  It's perspective.  So what should you do, without trying to involve yourself in a lot of stuff you don't have time for?  First, you may be worrying too much about how you "come across," and worrying that others won't like you because you don't think of yourself as the kind of person they would like.  So, decide first that you have a right to live your life as you see fit, and that people will like you for who you are.  Don't spend one second trying to impress others, as the effort is always wasted.  If they are going to like you, they will, and if they are not, then all the "interesting" things you have done or stories you can tell will not matter.  The kind of people you want to be spending time with do not need to be impressed.  Second, it really isn't necessary to decide right now what you want out of life.  Are you happy?  Do you find some personal satisfaction in looking at a pc screen?  What's wrong with that??  If you can honestly say that you like the life you are leading, then you need do nothing.  It is only if you are unhappy with yourself that you need to consider change.
yazZH4khaa	There must be something in your life that is going on right now under my assumption. If you believe in God, then Pray for those thoughts to be removed. <br>   If this persists, then you need to open up and let someone know; namely a professional or your parents.

You will!!!|`|22eb312dbb14b4b8f995bc33606eb782aa	Because you don't have a 'how to' plan, (and your on answers asking the question) I am assuming you are not serious.  There is a cure, get out of the house! Go find a friend, a hobby and something fun to do.  Preferably all three!  Even if you don't feel like it, especially if you don't feel like it,  be a "yes" person. (That means take up every social invitation you get weather you are interested in it or not!)  Volunteer! Dance! Become a text junkie!  If its social, just say yes!<br>  <br>  Take it seriously when and if you start making specific plans that include methods.  Till then, make yourself to busy to think about it!|`|JGj8TN2saa	i have had them to you know just think of something else like if you did kill oyurself thinjk  of the people who you might hurt|`|Ewosh9pTaa	You won't be stuck like this forever.<br>  Ride out the dark night and wait till the new dawn.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	Please call the suicide prevention helpline<br>  <br>  1-800-273-TALK (8255).The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a 24-hour, toll-free suicide prevention service available to anyone in suicidal crisis.

Once you figure out what transpired in your life that cause these thoughts (if you know) then you can take the next step. But you have to know your life in order to do that.
AA12360662	Random village ... Call of duty = things you are familiar with<br>  stood on a bus = waiting for chance to make right decision<br>  girl you fancy on = desire<br>  her ex is trying to kill himself = disappointment, feeling defeat<br>  <br>  Since this is recurring dream, it may mean unresolved in some aspect of your life.  This dream may hint something about things you feel lack of control about.  It could be about girl or anything else.  Projecting her ex trying to kill himself basically reflects the defeat or disappointment in you.  You may be feeling the need to have courage in terms of getting close relationship.  This may point to the girl you fancy on if she indeed exists in reality.<br>  <br>  In other words, there may be things you feel comfortable in reality, but you are in lack of courage to do so, and that is why you had this dream vent out.
OdoLSDlXaa	You might need to call 911 and tell them she said she would do this.   They can have her assessed at a psych hospital.  That is the thing to do if she said outright that she is going to kill herself.  If you believe she is just thinking about it, then listen to her and ask questions to clarify why she wants to do this.  Then try to get her connected to a mental health professional.  Questions like, have you ever seen a counselor? and Maybe a counselor could help, have you talked to your doctor about this? Maybe the Dr would refer you to someone who could help, are all in the right direction.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Get her to call a suicide hot-line.<br>  <br>  If she won't, then you do it and ask them what you can do.

P3Mt18Usaa	Don't care what they think, stay away from them they don't like you, you don't like them so of course they are going to say horrible things to you just don't take any notice of them. Shake it off forget what they said and move on.|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	You obviously have not gained experience from situations like this, some will automatically ignore and not let it upset them, others will feel bad about it because perhaps they have not felt this before and not understood there are such individuals that can be nasty in this way, so they are shocked, typically tagged sensitive individuals.<br>  Just see, the chances are that that individual has no picture I.D., typical online "Tough Guys" you see this in YouTube, such people will make nasty comments on people’s videos, yet they themselves have nothing in their channel.<br>  Ignore this, as you can not really do anything as it is online but get affected by the comment, if it was IRL, face to face, the chances are the person would not make such a remark.|`|n9d7dWaAaa	Ahh! People give me nasty comments every once in a while, their friendly ones though, so I do it back, and make them EVEN nastier. What you do is, act like nothing happened. And even if you feel rotten, mad, and sad inside, you take a deep breath, look at them in the face, smile, and say something mean, as if it were a joke even though you mean it with all your heart. That's what I always do. It feels good cause you just dissed them back, and you get over it too.

WQlNNHuXaa	I may have Daddy issues because my greatest memories of him are largely of a very angry man with veins popping out of his head who occasionally stares at my chest, like he forgot I was his daughter.And a sick suspicion that he rubbed his erection on me when I was a little girl because he thought I wouldn't understand. In any case, I get confused as he is horrible to me, abusive to me when I was a little girl for no reason at all, and as I have gotten older he seems oblivious as to why I have a certain resentment towards him and am in a permanent state of hostility.He will materially provide, but in every other sense it is an impossibility. But I am leaving home soon, and going to freaking forget about someone like that!|`|dmCyY2SKaa	My father is an anti role model in my life (I have many). No, I don't have daddy issues, because I've accepted personal responsibility. There were times/situations in my life where I was a "victim" and what have you, but I never felt like one because I knew that if I accepted a victim status, a victim was all I'd ever be.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  If I ever have a daughter someday I'd like for her to have a father whom she loves, respects, trusts and cherishes. "Daddy issues" are best avoided, if at all possible.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Sabrina, Is that why you are a submissive?|`|nhZb43pIaa	I have serious daddy issues that have effected my whole life and still do to this day.<br>  I have been to more than one psychiatrist on this, it has never helped me.<br>  I would talk much more about it, but it's personal and I don't know a thing about you, not to mention you only have 164 points so I don't think your for real.<br>  Know that my other 2 sisters are also nuts. All obvious daddy issues but all 3 of us display it in different ways, it's pretty weird and sick.<br>  <br>  Email me if you would like.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mabel, Yes, I belive that is why I'm a true submissive in relationships. Again a huge subject of discussion. I would never let a man strike me out of anger like an abusive husband, HOWEVER, I can only be with a man who is heavily into Domination & submission...heavy.... I literally can't be with a regular straight man.  I truely believe my father has ruined my whole life.  I hate him with a passion, a passion that's strong in my body every day. I have not spoken to him in 15 years, and when my mother died he couldn't sit in the family area for her funeral because I told everyone if he showed up and put on a show at her grave I would get a gun and kill him (They knew I was serious). He sat in the with rest of the people. My mother was the kindest, gentle woman you could ever meet, she was my world and he is a aweful man who should be dead, not her. How can evil like him live and people like her be taken. It makes me sick. Yet, another reason I see the physichitrist. The anger is immense and won't go away.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	My dad is just a dad.  I don't have any issues with him.  He helped to raise me (even though my parents are divorced).  I don't see him or talk to him as much as I do my mother, but that is only because my mother calls me all the time and comes over.  I see my dad enough though, he knows pretty much what is happening in my life.  Why do men always think women have daddy issues, they never ask if they have mommy issues?|`|LR48Rtv2aa	The only issue I have with my father is that he didn't try to be in my life and he is extremely selfish.|`|p6gDNa3laa	most of them|`|NnG8PxMzaa	My dad is dead.

He is awesome and still a major influence upon my life.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  No it isn't sad, and he wasn't 'dumped'--that puts a spin on the whole thing that isn't even in the realm of possibility.  When I married, my "immediate family" became my husband, and I became his, now that we have a child, we are a unit of three.  Not sad, the way of things as MY family believes<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT #2:  Hahahha you are hysterical sdsd.  Sounds like someone has some issues with mumsy no?  Thanks for the laugh hon

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, everyone looks different...<br>  <br>  Most importantly: The people who call other people ugly, are the UGLY ONES THEMSELVES. :)<br>  <br>  What do you mean by ugly? Big nose? Acne? Fat face? Trust me, everyone has problems of that sort. Even Jessica Alba, she's beautiful, but her eyes are small. So? She's still really pretty. <br>  <br>  And you don't have to develop a personality..I'm sure you have a nice one already! How old are you? Still in highschool? Then get used to it, if you're the quiet, not-so-fashionable type. Highschool's just stupid...wait till life actually starts AFTER highschool, then you'll meet your real friends and people who matter.<br>  <br>  Heh, something you can do: Wake up, go in front of the mirror, look at yourself, and tell yourself you're beautiful.

If you look at some of the most gorgeous women they have self esteem issues [try maybe Pamela Anderson, constantly going back to the same two guys, bad relationships] and there are many other women. What you NEED to do is accept what you see. IT isn't going to ever change what is in the mirror unless you get surgery so embrace it. Maybe your teeth aren't straight, but your eyes are pretty, focus on them. Everyone has flaws and everyone has something pretty about them. Your inner will absolutely reflect your outside so you need to feel good about yourself. When you gain confidence people will notice you. Haven't you seen girls who are not that attractive but people pay attention to her? It's because she carries herself well, talks and is social, maybe dresses nice. Try doing your hair and makeup, take interest in yourself. Pamper yourself during and after every shower. Put lotion on, take time to do your hair, makeup ect. When you take time to do these things you will appreciate yourself and your body a lot more. The people who dont pay attention to you bc of your looks are not even worth getting to know. One day a guy will see the beauty in you and he will also love your personality. Just embrace yourself and your beauty. ;] good luck|`|r8VvBxM6aa	Ignore what other people say. I know it's not easy, but once you can block out everyone else's negativity you can focus on your own positivity. People are always going to try to bring you down, no matter what stage of life you're in. Just know you're better than that and be aware of yourself so you don't do it to anyone else. If you need, write out a list of things you like about yourself, go shopping and give yourself a makeover. Whatever you do though, do it for you, and not to please anyone. At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Well the obvious is plastic surgery if you can afford it.  I know I would go for it if I could.  Apart from that, I guess you may just recognise that even beautiful people often still 'feel' ugly even if they're not.  So please do not worry so much.  <br>  <br>  I met a guy - he was interesting because he sang.  Now his nose was very big & I noticed his feet were too.  He had long frizzy hair - yes, quite a strange guy.  <br>  <br>  I liked his style & was amazed that he could get on stage no matter how people saw him.

He asked if could walk me home.<br>  I noticed how thin he was, I've often been told I am very attractive.<br>  He went to leave after he walked me home, he didn't ask for a kiss goodbye.  I hesitated & thought perhaps he wasn't too attracted to me.<br>  Then he said, would you be my girlfriend?<br>  So I said yes, I would like that!  <br>  Now he is very 'interesting looking' but I loved being with him.  <br>  He's now married to someone else & has kids.<br>  <br>  What I am saying is, it's just about being YOU!

If you were told that you were ugly your whole life, you need to spend each morning in the mirror, looking at yourself in the eyes and telling YOURSELF that you are beautiful in so many ways.  There is no such thing as an ugly person... only an ugly personality... and the world is full of them.  But if you really give it a go it will eventually work.  You'll find that in your daily vulnerable moments, you'll be reassuring yourself that you are beautiful/friendly/kind/diplomatic/hones... just start with "I am...."|`|BVf2eAWnaa	I would think about:<br>  What is ugly/beautiful?<br>  What do you think makes people think such and such are beautiful/ugly?<br>  Can you think of an instance where what you considered beautiful was considered ugly and vice versa?<br>  Do you think persons/things you love are ugly?

I'm not sure what is making you feel ugly when you look in the mirror so it's hard to make suggestions.  Is it maybe something that can be made to look a little better with some correct makeup applications?  Is there a problem with your skin that maybe could be helped along a bit with some medicated creams or lotions?  Could your hair color maybe be enhansed a bit with an inexpensive box of Nice n Easy in the pharmacy?  Do your teeth not look their best and maybe a visit to the dentist is in order?  Sorry I'm just  taking a guess here but sometimes a little work on your looks could make a difference in the way you feel when you look in the mirror.<br>  Now for your inside.  Are you a spiritual person at all?  Are you involved in any type of church group or anything to do with meditation in order to feel the love inside?  Could you maybe volunteer at something you are passionate about?  Maybe an animal shelter, nursury school, nursing home etc to give of yourself would take the focus off of how you look.  Any organization is starved for genuine help and would most likely welcome you with open arms.  Do you have a hobby that you care about?  Maybe something physical like skating, running, sports, etc?  Or are you into museums, theater etc.  My point is if you are doing something you love, you are going to be happiest.  If you are doing something you love, you are also going to meet other like minded people with whom you have a lot in common and therefore make new friends.  Anything that makes you happy will make you look and act happy...happy people attract other happy people.  Focus on your goals and happiness and the rest will follow.We can all do pretty much anything we make up our minds to do..you can do this.    Best wishes.|`|wdN6IGXAaa	Ok if people call you ugly then don't listen to them because whoever calls you ugly is just nothing but a JERK!!! Here's my advice for you: if anyone ever calls you ugly just tell them that " God created me and he didn't create anything ugly". Why do you think your ugly? I bet your not ugly I bet your really pretty! Because everyone is beautiful in some way and everyone has problems with their body and face. Even celebrities have problems like that because Ashley Simpson is a very beautiful young women but she used to have a big nose and then she got plastic surgery on it and now she has one of the bestest nose jobs on the planet! You shouldn't be sad about what other people think of you because God made everyone different. And people may have problems and screw-ups with their body or face but every problem is a doorway to a solution. Just be strong, stand up to people, and always try to be yourself. Always be who you are on the inside because in the end it all pays off and really matters. You should be happy for how you look whether you have acne, a fat and big face, a big nose, fat lips, a crippled smile, small or big eyes, crooked and ugly teeth, or even alot of wrinkles on your face. Who cares about what other people say and who cares about how you look? Because your not perfect and neither is anyone else . This is the quote and saying I live by and I always remeber this saying when people judge me: " Who are you to judge me? I know Im not perfect and I don't CLAIM to be! But before you start pointing fingers, make sure your own hands are clean!"

Such as the deaf person’s family member’s voices, however I really do not know.<br>  Not all thinking involves the use of hearing a voice however; some thinking is just resourcefulness and logical thinking.

And, you may be having a difficult time focusing and concentrating because the job is overwhelmingly boring and it doesn't fit into your perception of yourself and your capabilities.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you should attempt to accept your current position as a temporary detour on your way to your ultimate goals.<br>  <br>  But, while you are at this way station, you should embrace the notion that you need to do the best job you can by concentrating, focusing and projecting a enthusiastic and caring persona.<br>  <br>  You will learn much from this job.

You will discover this when you leave the high school world od conformity and meet some mature human beings. In some cultures, a rounder body is regularly preferred.The stick-girls would appear (and probably ARE malnourished.)  Look also at the classic statues and paintings of Micheangelo and such...Eve, angels, and classic beauties are portrayed as anything BUT "stick-figures."  <br>  Also be aware that photographers touch up and air brush every magazine photo, so even the "perfect" models are anything but 'perfect-looking". Also, nearly every teen girl feels ugly, (my teen was shocked when the skinny girls envied her curvy form!) <br>  <br>  As for self-esteem, remember that beauty is only skin-deep, but ugly goes all the way to the bone!  You can emphasize your best physical assets with clothes and make-up, but it is the beauty of your heart that will never fade.

1YBLPUFqaa	When I reminisce past memories, I always receive an image in my mind of the child detached from society.<br>  <br>  Throughout the years, I have remained intrigued in the mystical conundrums of life. Abstract and theoretical concepts of human behavior appealed to me at youth. I questioned our existence, our purpose, and our motivation.<br>  <br>  During my elementary years, I was the outsider. Interaction with the other children just did not come of interest to me. A multitude of teachers imprudently labeled me as the socially-inhibited loner. <br>  <br>  My parents were also worried about what I was to become. I sought gratification within nature, including stray felines and neighborhood hounds. Since animals do not talk or judge or despise you for who you are, I can honestly confess that they were my salvation. <br>  <br>  However, I was weak. I succumbed to emotional abuse and peer pressure, driving me to the verge of insanity. Soon afterward, I experienced a drastic transformation within myself, enforcing extroversion and strict confinement to social mandates. I did not know who I was.<br>  <br>  I cannot express the torment. But, I retrospect that my persona was a fake. The foolish child futilely intended to assimilate within the populace, yet continued to be haunted by inane cognizance of her acumen.

6a1e9cfecba9cca5f73fcc28bd074580aa	Hi Princess.<br>  <br>  Feeling your feelings puts you in the flow of life. First; choose to feel as richly and as deeply as possible. Second; let the feelings *keep* flowing. Let go of those feelings once you feel them. That's where we so often screw up. We insist on hanging on to feelings we don't even like - because we have a secret agenda in mind.<br>  <br>  If you're feeling hopelessness, despair, angst, etc. - you can always feel those feelings and release them. You inherently possess that ability. Every human does. You're not special enough to be the only person on earth who can't release the pain from unresolved feelings.<br>   <br>  CHOOSE to understand, and let the details take care of themselves. CHOOSE - before you go to sleep at night - as you're lying in bed - CHOOSE to have the understanding revealed to you during the course of your dreams. And be willing to receive the answers.<br>  <br>  Choose to understand your feelings or lack of feelings. Choose to understand how it can be okay to feel hopeless. Choose to understand why you would not let the feelings flow freely.<br>  <br>  The feeling of hopelessness is a very negative force in our life and it lies to us! It deceives you! So never ever rely on your feelings! Feelings are very deceiving, especially the feeling of hopelessness.<br>  So never ever think that your life has no purpose because your life is significant and important!<br>  <br>  There will be up and down in our life, but nothing in this world stays permanent unless you let them to be permanent. After the rain, the sun will shine again!<br>  <br>  You have the power to change your circumstances and life right in your very own hands, but you must make the decision to use that power to change your circumstances today.<br>  <br>  Surround yourself with positive people, read book and inspiring books, watch good and inspiring movies and listen to inspirational CDs/tapes. Do anything positive to get yourself back up from self pities. You can do it!<br>  <br>  Get those feelings flowing! Get back to your NATURAL flow of emotion. Find and tap into your wellspring of raw, emotional energy<br>  <br>  Goodnight princess xoxo<br>  Wishing you sunshine, love and laughter. Not just today, but all the days after <br>  <br>  Never forget that life is so precious live life to the full appreciate every moment.

AwAw0uiKaa	I feel that men have a great disadvantage with our society's views towards women, as as women we are seen as victims. Even if you don't see it that way yourself, the general attitude is that they are always the victim, even when they are in the wrong. My husband, a man who is in a wheelchair (he's a quadriplegic), had a very abusive ex-wife who would do many horrible things to him physically and neglectfully that he couldn't defend himself from because of his disability. When he went to the group meeting with bruises on his face from her beating him, all of the people in the meeting were women, and the leaders were women... and he was treated like sh*t even though he was clearly the victim.<br>  <br>  Abusive women are a pathetic representation of our gender. They abuse their rights and demand for more. They get away with horrible things but scream at the top of their lungs if a man even lays one hand on her in defense, even if she is the provoker.<br>  <br>  Abusive women make me want to spit.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	We just don't punish women. Women can get away with killing a man by claiming that he was abusing her when he's no longer alive to defend himself (yes, there are pathetic cases like that). And much of the abuse females commit is either unreported or the criminal is treated with impunity.<br>  <br>  That leads to the stats doodlebugjim has posted. Non-reciprocal violence by women is so high, because men don't hit back in the knowledge that if they do hit back, they'll be the ones in jail, not the woman.|`|79ab2ac723d6fa6d643348f5a67b7e74aa	There's more going on than most realize.  We don't understand depression.  We don't understand mental illness.  We don't understand depression related specifically to child-birth.  Did you know that depression after child-birth can last for 5 years?  Left untreated it can become something which lasts a life-time.<br>  <br>  Does that make abuse acceptable?  No.  It might make it preventable and treatable.  Support mothers before abuse happens.  Support women before disaster.<br>  <br>  Then there are the jerks.  You can't help them.  They are just jerks or just mean.  They look just like other women.  Can't tell them apart from women who are depressed and hurting.  You have to acknowledge their existence as well as those who are depressed.<br>  <br>  Men too suffer from depression.  Again, they usually look like anyone else.|`|oK6sZ2fmaa	I know just what you're saying, here in this city last year a husband and his wife killed their 3 year old son, a plea bargain was arrainged and the wife gets 17 years to turn against her husband for the state, he gets 65 because he delivered the last blow before the little boy went into a coma, then died. Both admitted to abusing the boy, she deserves the same 65, in another case a woman beats a man while he's passed out drunk, puts him in ICU for 3 days and after 18 months nothing, but the other way around, a man would still be in jail, I'm a woman, but I also see the injustice towardmen sometimes.|`|NnG8PxMzaa	Well, considering the fact that something like 35% of children in the United States grow up without fathers, it's only logical, though just as appalling, for the percentages of child abuse committed by a mother to be greater.

Where'd you get the stats?   <br>  <br>  I don't see who would think child abuse is good, so I don't get your question. Yes, child abuse is bad. Yes child abusers are bad. Yes both women and men abuse children emotionally and physically, with more women physically abusing children, and both women and men sexually abuse children, with more men sexually abusing children. This is news? Suggestions for doing something about it? As far as I can see, there's not a lot of accountability for either female or male abusers-both seem to think they can get away with it. Same goes for adult battering-they do get away with it too. And violence escalates there, this is news?<br>  <br>  As far as parental murders, I don't think 60-40 rate of female to male murder rates are anything to brag about. Where'd you get those stats? What can be done about stopping both parents from killing their kids? Why do so many parents think they can get away with murdering their kids?<br>  <br>  What does rape allegations and your dubious stats have to do with physical and emotional abuse of children-or did you just have to make sure you said something else that made women sound worse than men?

AA11058500	Lets see, where to begin. I used to have the same problem as you. It was tough, it really interfered with my academical and social performance. So as my "personal failures" seemed painfully continuous, I really started think exactly WHY it was happening. It was tough for me to find a girl friend. It was tough to make friends. It was tough to make people know who I was. So I began to wonder..."what is it that is limiting me from what I want?" From there on, I didn't ask myself whether I would succeed or fail in general. I wondered, "what limits me from doing better/more than I already am?" So instead of asking yourself whether you can just succeed in anything in general, question the barriers are that limit you as is. For example, lets say you keep getting a B/B+ on all of your math tests. You really want to get that A to look good on your report card. Ask yourself, "What is limiting from getting that A? Am I paying enough attention in class? Am I doing all of my homework? What are my study habits? How could I improve them?" If you do this, a lot of the time you will see amazing results.<br>  Another part of confidence is just flat out believing. Really, believe it or not (yes, I did intend that pun). If you just keep telling yourself you can do something, you REALLY start to believe you can do it. For example, if you want to go out and meet a girl, just BELIEVE you can do it. I know it sounds incredibly stupid, but if you truly, powerfully believe in yourself, you will enjoy the outcome tremendously. Furthermore, girls see confidence in a guy as very attractive. When it comes to girls however, it is A LOT more than just confidence...but back to my point. A mental exercise you can do is just keep telling yourself you can do something. Just keep telling yourself what ever your doing. If your walking to the store, tell yourself you can reach your goals and you are completely uncompromising to all. You won't let any one get in your way of what you want (before I continue, there is a difference between confidence and arrogance. Don't be arrogant when doing this. No one likes an arrogant person who is completely egocentric). This leads me to my next point.<br>  Another way to build confidence is stop telling yourself all the negative things about yourself. Don't be a pessimist about yourself. Here's an exercise: get a pen and a piece of paper. Right down all the positive and negative things about yourself. From now on, only say the positive things about yourself in your head. Stop thinking about the negative things. Sub-consciously, it will bring your confidence down. Only say the positive things in your head. <br>  So good luck. If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.
AA11028028	Look the few people who can sense things or have seen unusual things that few others can see, feel or so on, are called crazy. Your not crazy. I have seen the occasional ghost. I don't like it but it does happen. As for increasing or decreasing your abilities? I donno. I prefer to be a closeted sensitive. If you want to talk you can write me or catch me on YIM. <br>  As for ghosts talking. If you have a "sensitives ear" you could probably grasp what he or she was Trying to say. <br>  If you want to confront this possible ghost you have to keep yourself calm. Sometimes they just want someone to know they are still there. <br>  I Know I am not very helpful but I do hope this has helped you a bit. Good luck!!|`|urNgcpiBaa	If I were you I would have either crapped my pants or puked everywhere.  You probably have some kind of disorder or desease.

9UTAQs1Zaa	Schools teach children facts that shape their opinions and worldviews.<br>  <br>  Families are the earliest influence on children's lives and pass on political, religious, and cultural opinions.|`|fBVW11xGaa	Socialization and our social characteristics relies on many major factors but all stem from the same institution/<br>  <br>  THE FAMILY, the family sets the standards that the future generations have to live up to. they also learn their norms and values via the family institution. as stated the family also have a hand in leading the future generation down the correct spiritual path with religious and moral beliefs. These are all the key elements needed through out socialization.<br>  but don't think that socialization is just for the young. our whole life we learn and relearn to socialize. The family comes under the heading 'kinship' this can also include marriage.<br>  <br>  The other heading could be the   'cultural'   which includes the    'school'    you go to, the    'church'     you attend. these all conform with the cultural norms and values ie, the family.<br>  The Family is without doubt the most important institution within society but out with there is many smaller institutions that play a major role also.|`|aOd0Djkaaa	Church and families.

I don't think she gets upset about it cause it happened a long time ago but just try not to dwell on the issue around her too much.|`|3zPQPdPqaa	I lost my dad to cancer when I was nine. Strangely, my best friend of 5 years lost her mum when she was a baby. It's brought us closer; as children (I'm now fourteen, she's fifteen) we used to think my dad and her mum would marry in heaven. We still fantasize that my mum and her dad would get married. Yes, when she talks about her dad I do get a funny feeling, same as when I talk about my mum and I feel guilty, but we're so close we don't really notice. Also I don't like it when people call my stepdad my dad, but I've given up correcting people. So yes I do get a weird feeling. Also when I see little girls with their dads, I think they're so lucky.
913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	You say to your counsellor exactly what you have said on YA....just that....it will flow from there. A counsellor is trained to listen. Don't worry it will be alright and you will get things off your chest you did not even know were there , all the very best !!!!|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	maybe you are still missing something in your life but don't know what that is, just tell you counsellor everything and exactly how you feel. who knows, maybe she can help you. be open with her and hopefully it will be ok|`|dK6YGyNyaa	You need to just walk into the room, sit down, and say exactly what comes into your mind - don't let the counsellor interrupt you or try to sway the conversation to something else she thinks is more "relevant" - obviously she isn't getting the gist of what is wrong with you because you haven't truly opened up to her yet. Let yourself be free, let it all spill out and I guarantee that by just saying it all out loud you will feel like a huge weight has been lifted, and then the real help can begin. Good luck.|`|B4YESGmwaa	Kerry, most counselors like to establish some back ground knowledge with you so they can better understand where certain behaviors, feelings or attitudes may have started from. BUT if you are have a pressing issue I would not stop from starting the conversation,saying "I have something I need to discuss today". What you have to realize is IF you have clinical depression, it has to do with a chemical imbalance in the brain. Also if it is not clinical depression, sometimes the more we talk the more we get in touch with feelings we ofter buried from out child hood. Those childhood feelings are buried alive, waiting for a time to come to the surface. Keep working with your counselor, another thing you might try is doing some jouranaling when you are feeling low, maybe you can start to see a pattern form that you can share with your counselor. God Bless Reggie|`|6w7FKrlfaa	when i first went to counselling..  i was soo sure that i didn't have a problem.. i thought we would just sit there for an hour and say nothing.  it's been a year now.. and i love airing my crap for an hour a fortnight...  it hasn't helped my anxiety and ocd at all... but i feel 'lighter' sharing stuff with her.. that i would normally keep to myself.. i think that it takes time with the right counsellor.. and u'll open up eventually.  see a different doc..  sometimes people need medication to help u through it.|`|FlMyCRUtaa	Spill your beans!|`|kTVQ4QeGaa	Dominic is right....quite often counsellors are giving you an 'open space' to talk. Say 'this week I have something I'd like to talk about' and then just open up, tell her. Say I don't know what's wrong with me, and it's scary. <br>  even if she cant help you instantly, at least maybe it'll help to ease the pain a little bit.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this helps, but I went through a period in my life where I felt absolutely awful low and depressed, and had horrible black thoughts, and it does pass. If you're counsellor can't help, maybe speak with your doctor about helping you with some mood stabalizers. Now I'm pretty much fine, you can get through. Just stay strong, ask for help.<br>  <br>  Good luck honey.|`|a9bb4ee4324503197ef00de7893da3dcaa	you do have to remember that seeing a counselor is also establishing a new relationship. not all relationships work out so you may need to think of getting a different counselor. but do keep in mind that you should give it some time before you expect any results. the counselor doesn't know you so getting your full history does take some time. and not to mention the fact that you can't fix the present unless you figure out what went wrong in the past. my advice would be to stick it out with the counselor for a few more sessions, and if there is something that you feel needs to be addressed immediately then by all means bring it up. tell your counselor how you are feeling about your progress or lack there of. and if you're still not satisfied you may need to move in another direction....best of luck.|`|V5CsAF3gaa	say what you just said to us|`|9ybZ5kkeaa	You should definitely tell her how you feel about your sessions with her. Why don't you think they're helping? What can she do if anything to make you feel at least a little better? If you've only just started meeting with the counselor, then she's probably trying to get to know you and see if anything in your past or at home may be causing you any distress. If there is anything that you would like to talk about with your counselor, just bring it up. I'm sure she'll listen.|`|HYbYkcPPaa	I've been there - talking to a counselor and feeling like it's not going anywhere.  What I've eventually discovered is that they are doing what they're supposed to - which is let you talk about anything and everything, and that supposedly it will come out in time.<br>  <br>  However, I have found that there are counselors who will challenge you much more than others, that is, they'll actually ask you questions, questions that are blunt, and assign tasks to you like journaling about specific topics for example.<br>  <br>  Just because you may like your counselor, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're the right one for you, so don't be afraid to shop around and find one who's a good fit for you (just be careful that you're not picking one that is too easy for you).  <br>  <br>  I agree with the other post that a physician may be of additional help, whether it's a referral to another professional or prescription help.  <br>  <br>  Keep it up though, the fact that you're trying means you want the help - don't stop until you get what you need.|`|uyRf8HyCaa	Hello, I also agree with a few people above me, you just need to tell everything! Just to relate to you, I also went through depression. My therapist was talking about the past and various topics that didnt make me feel better when i talked about it, so i finally just went in her room knowing i was going to tell absolutely everything that bothered me.Things I didnt even know were troubling me even came out, and you will feel so much better. She probably is trying to let you feel more comfortable and begin opening up yourself, so she wont be surprised when you tell her everything. Trust me, it may not feel like you will ever feel better, but after one session of me telling all, it already lifted 1000 pounds off my shoulders. Good luck and your totally not alone, so many people think the same thoughts and have the same issues, just tell your therapist everything! :)

3secB3Smaa	you need to find purpose. This is your answer. Leave college and join a group like the peace corp or some other group that does service for humanity.There are groups that go to Africa and help people.<br>  <br>  You have to make up your mind to spend a year finding a purpose that you will serve.<br>  <br>  You need to be involved with the human struggle.<br>  You are not ready for college yet.<br>  A higer purpose is calling you. Answer it.|`|WLgPZToUaa	why don't you try to read the Bible?<br>  maybe the reason that you've lost sight of your future and can't find any happiness is because you don't think that life has any meaning?? if this is true..than what it the point of it all, right??<br>  if you believe Christianity, than you have a purpose and you no longer are just a random lady in a sea of people. you become a woman who was created by a powerful God. He will always listen to you and be there...it's the way He is. That's my advice..and about guys and friends..just get out there. im sure someone will come to you and you can build a relationship. but first to do this, you have to WANT it.
AA12360662	Bed in dream symbol often means privacy.  In your case, it may involve with some privacy invasion.  These two significant people may have lots to do with your privacy level.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, you are losing respect from them. Projecting them taking over or sleeping in your bed basically reflects losing respect, losing control in your life.  Sleeping is not the focus of the dream.<br>  <br>  The focus is taking over your privacy by them. Perhaps, lately you are feeling not compromised in some way with either them or someone else.  They could also be symbol of your helplessness and you vent it out in this dream.
stHol8ITaa	Are you trying to figure out whether *you* are shy or introverted, or whether another person is? If the former, it's more easier.<br>  <br>  Shy people might crave social interaction (unless they're far on the introverted scale too), though are nervous about interacting with others (not to be mistaken with social phobia however). Shyness tends to arise instead from a fear of judgment, not been liked, finding themselves in an embarrassing social situation etc. If whenever you go to interact with others you rather hesitate a lot, or feel nervous, then you're shy. Shy people sometimes give off non-verbal clues about their discomfort (such as blushing or been unable to maintain eye contact, a common trait among shy people which is often misinterpreted as been rude, disinterested or arrogant), but this isn't always the case; some shy people don't give off these non-verbal clues and thus are often misinterpreted as been cold, anti-social, rude, arrogant etc. as well.<br>  <br>  Introverted people on the other hand tend to be comfortable in social situations (unless also shy), however, they like more time on their own too. You've probably seen extremely outgoing, extroverted people who seem to have a never-ending supply of energy in social situations, it's like social situations make them energetic; with introverts, the opposite is true, and thus an introvert enjoys their own company now and then, though the majority of them are not complete hermits. Only in extreme cases do introverts prefer to spend all their times in solitude.|`|gpON465Iaa	If they are timid or easily startled or if they draw back from others they see when they are out in public and want to avoid conversation, want to avoid the other person, afraid of the relationship, fear of the other or fear of self - THEN THE PERSON IS SHY.  If you are more interested in your self than others and if you prefer to be alone then you are INTROVERTED!  But don't tell.|`|kt2i6eKXaa	one way is to see if it's easy for that person to make friends. if not, either you're having a bad day or you're an introvert. an introvert also likes to spend more time alone than w/ others.|`|xPeIvywdaa	well do they want to be around other people, do they get energy from being around other people<br>  <br>  or does being alone give them energy|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	Shy people are afraid of social interaction introverts just don't like it.
