At my school dances i would grind with a few of the girls, but it seems to be much harder to start grinding with random girls.      Well, yesterday i got **** faced n smoked half a blunt to my face with my friends. We went into the bar to do some dancing, i think i might have been to high, and i ask my friend how do u start grinding with girls. He told me just tap them and ask if you wanna dance, so i was like okay.      Tried this 8 times got rejected 7 times hehe, wasnt gonna leave until i had atlesat one.      Is what i am doing wrong?       I find at my school dances i would dance to the music and if i see a girl shaking her butt or w.e near me, and i guess we slowly start getting a little closer(or i jus go closer) grinding with me coming up from behind and grinding to see see if they go away would that be appropriate or do u girls think its a creep who does that ? i need suggestions thanks !       I am 19 btw, and going to a party tonight to try ag !

But could you please tell me which one sounds better for me. A little information about is I'm a 16 year old girl and I like all types of books.      Milkrun - Sarah Mlynowski    Of all the ways to find myself Single Again, this has to be the worst. A "Dear Jackie" e-mail from my supposed boyfriend, who claimed to be "finding himself" in Thailand. Instead, he's found someone else. And dumped me.       But I, Jackie Norris, will bounce back! I will become Crazy Dating Girl and prove to Jilting Jeremy that I am over him! One snag: Why do all the guys I meet either have groping hands, lunatic tendencies or a worrying interest in putting up shelves? I need a man who wants to rip my clothes off, feed me pizza, then have stimulating, intelligent conversation.       Single in Boston -- come on there has to be someone!            Two - Way Street - Lauren Barnholdt    There are two sides to every breakup. This is Jordan and Courtney, totally in love. Sure, they were an unlikely high school couple. But they clicked; it worked. They're even going to the same college, and driving cross-country together for orientation. Then Jordan dumps Courtney -- for a girl he met on the Internet. It's too late to change plans, so the road trip is on. Courtney's heartbroken, but figures she can tough it out for a few days. La la la -- this is Courtney pretending not to care. But in a strange twist, Jordan cares. A lot. Turns out, he's got a secret or two that he's not telling Courtney. And it has everything to do with why they broke up, why they can't get back together, and how, in spite of it all, this couple is destined for each other.

20090307145046AAeoHnO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Suggestions for book reading (Fantasy)?	Hi, I am on spring break and wanting to read a book, preferably audiobook but books are good too. I am a really big fan of books like Harry Potter, The seventh Tower, The lord of the Rings, and Eragon. I just finished eragon, I read all 3 books in a week and it frustrates me that I have to wait another 2 or 3 years for the final book. Anyway, the book has to have magic, and I like the majority of the book cannot be in a setting such as a city or something of that matter. I like different races such as elves, dwarfs, giants, dragons, shadows, shades and all sorts of other interesting creatures but humans have to be present as well even if the main caracter isnt. Its kinda a strict criteria but I just want to give you a clear understands of what I like. Any suggestions would be appreciated though. All but the seventh tower have been very popular books so if you name a popular book let me know so I'll pay close attention to it as it will most likely be good if it is popular. And please dont name the book about a vampire, I cant remember its name but it wasnt very good so I didnt even finish reading it. Thanks again for any help.

"let us therefore agree that the idea of eternal return implies a perspective from which things appear other than as we know them: they appear without the mitigating circumstances of their transitory nature. This mitigating circumstance prevents us from coming to s verdict. For how can we condemn something that is ephemeral, in transit. In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia. This reconciliation reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rest essentially on the non-existence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore  everything cynically permitted".

He pretended to be a different man, his wealthy cousin Brian Waldorf. Then it appeared that he was his never-to-do well lazy cousin Wendover. We separated immediately after our wedding, and I got a job. About a year later my cousins died, and my father inherited a lot of money and a fine estate. Brian immediately "recollected" me, found me and moved in with my father.   He's been sponging off him since then. He did not work, he kept Chambers (a lawyer's office), but never had any cases, and went to town only to drink and meet friends. My father died, and left me a lot of money, and even more to my half brother Vernon. If something happens to Vernon, I inherit everything.  Then I noticed that Brian   started drinking too much brandy and soda. He is never drunk, he drinks it throughout the day. The local doctor told me that it was called "pegging" - sipping liquor throughout the day. That is what Brian does. He has visions, too. He sees snowflakes in summer, collects invisible silver coins from the floor, sees men, hiding behind trees, stalking him, says that his enemies wants to imprison him. Once he said that Vernon died and I inherited the place, though my brother is well and alive. I consulted two medical men, hired a nurse-attendant, Towler, to look after him. Brian raves and hallucinates, he has delirium   tremens. But he refuses to be treated, and still manages to find alcohol, we found a stash in the bathroom, behind the pipes. He is a threat to himself and to us all, what should I do?

So I'm making a game :)   Here goes:      1. Turn to page five of the BOOK (fiction or nonfiction). Post the first line you see.   2. Turn to page 73 in the same book. Post the second last line on the page.   3. Now get your favourite book, or the fave one you have with you. Turn to the first page, and post the first, introduction sentence.    4. In same book, turn to very last page, and post the last line of text.   5. Grab and random book and flip to any random page. Close your eyes and pick a sentence at random. Post it.      Hope people enjoy this! :)   -Tila.

20090307095057AA973Ww	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need some help with my werewolf novel!? D:?	Okay, so I'm writing a novel. It's about werewolves, gods, goddesses, all that fantasy stuff. XD I'll give some information first though to make the question easier. It's in first person, the character is Gregory. He is shifting from Feral (full wolf form) to the form where he's more human than wolf but he still has more the anatomy of a wolf. Obviously he's a werewolf, but he's kind of new to the whole transformation thing. What I'm troubled with is how I'm going to describe it, I have some things down, but I need some assistance, or possibly some random examples, either is fine with me, I just need helpers XD. I am having trouble with describing the change that would be in his hind-legs (How I would describe his paws turning into feet that are still quite much like a wolf's but are slightly human) and some names of the muscles that a transformation would change..XD lawl.       Thanks in advance,   Courtnee D <3

In my last class I had French. The class is really dark so there are no shadows. I’m very thankful for that because I am so tiered and don’t feel like dealing with my shadow’s stupid actions. I fell asleep during class; I had the weirdest dream of my father. He looked exactly the same tall, muscular, tan, with a mustache and short brown hair. He was in his lab fighting on the phone about shadows, “the scientifical way to explain shadows is that light can’t go through most solid things. The spiritual way to explain it is, after a person’s death he can come back as a shadow”   ‘BRRRRRNG’ I woke up suddenly from the bell “glad you can finally join us Grace, don’t forget your exam tomorrow on what we just took today” mademoiselle Rana said. Great now I have an exam with something I have never heard of before in French ‘la pollution’ how in the world am I supposed to do a speaking about pollution in French when the only thing I know in French is ‘bon apatite’.

I had always thought that they published and got a portion of the sales but I've been looking around and it seems that they want you to pay to get published.

20090307114055AAnY0vc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Which would be a better thesis statement?	1. Emily Dickinson wrote so many stories referencing death, dying, and loneliness.     2. A common theme in her poems is a very negative view on society and her poems critique the tendency of society to replace necessary human emotion with duty and tediousness.   3. Wilkinson's use of familar language and colloquial tone convery her attitude that death and dying are not to be feared.   4. Emily Dickinson's writing and life was shaped by the events that took place in her lifetime.

Some people don't want to have family, enjoy life alone, dating, working etc. Some people have family, but working far from family (other country), dating with other girl, enjoy life also, while they send money also to their family. Some people called family men. Loyal to family, never make dating. Take care family more that anything. And so on, still many kind of life style. Which one do you prefer?

20090307113836AAGx8Zh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this plot sound interesting?	I've never been into writing anything suspenseful, but I sort of had this idea, and I think it would make a great book.      And it's weird, because I had the title right away.      I thought about naming in Black Widow, and its about this detective who has been getting these strange cases about many killings.  They've all been men who have been murdered, and somewhere along the crime scene, a letter has been written, and at the very end, a woman's name has been signed.  The police are confused.  Why would a killer sign her identity?  The police search for the women, but they aren't found - no such women exist.  At the end, they find out that it's about this one crazed woman who has had many husbands that have cheated on her, divorced her...etc.  And she's decided to kill them all for revenge,  (like the spider, the female black widow is occasionally known for killing her mate).  She's changed her name many times, and moved from town to town, finding the men she's been after for many years....

20090307110519AA5kPWF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think this STORY will make a good movie? and if you think so, write down who should play who..?	Danillo was born in a world of people who never aged, in the “other side”, as they called it. The people in the other side never age never grow. They reach maturity at their own capability; some can reach maturity and never grow again at age 14, some at 35, some even at 75. They die when they’ve done what they were meant to do, their calling to be more specific. They can guess their calling, might take years to find out what their real calling is. But Danillo wanted to age, wanted to grow as a person, not just someone who does something they are ordered to.       So Danillo crossed to the other side, which is our human world, but he still doesn’t age and will still die if his calling is completed. He arrives at the 1970’s and lived in an apartment. Next to the apartment lived a poor woman, yet beautiful, with whom he had a long affair - which lasts for 10 years - with. Until the woman, named Clarisse, realizes that Daniel – what he called himself – wasn’t aging. She turns crazy because of Daniel’s confession to her, since he thought she would understand. The woman – now 40 years old – goes to the mental hospital, where she meets her husband, Peter, who is a nurse. Daniel watches the two live a happy life together in the apartment building next to his, with his heart breaking.      Clarisse forgets everything about Daniel, because she has a mental disorder now. But she still lives normally, if she is never angered. Clarisse bears a daughter named Jane. Jane grows up in that apartment, right next to Daniel. Daniel befriends Peter and Clarisse (again, since she doesn’t remember him anymore) so he can still be close to the one he loved. He uses Jane, a 4 year old toddler at the time, as an excuse to visit Clarisse, whom he still loves. He offers his time to baby-sit and help take care of Jane, the toddler. He becomes her second father. Jane spends a lot of time with Daniel as a child, and is very comfortable with him. She grows up in front of Daniel’s eyes. Daniel’s initial intention of becoming Jane’s 2nd father is to feel like a family with Clarisse.      But when Daniel hears Jane singing from his apartment one afternoon, he immediately falls in love with the 13 year old. Jane sings all the time, while washing the dishes, cleaning the house, and watering the plants. She sings to her mother all the time as well. Daniel loves listening to her sing, and that makes him fall in love with her.      Jane confesses to Daniel her dream to become a famous singer. So Daniel does everything in his power to get her an agent, bring her to auditions, singing lessons, workshops and pay for her performance fees, since her mother is mentally-ill and her father is poor. Daniel does everything for Jane, even work 3 jobs for her.       Jane finally gets her big record-deal with Dante Records and records her debut album. She immediately rises to fame and earns a large amount of money all the time. She has many fans, many concerts, shows and paparazzi following her. She moves to a mansion with her father and mother, who are now retiring. Daniel moves in with them too, and is loved dearly by Jane, as a father.      Jane, now 18, is starting to fall in love with 30 year old Daniel – and is starting to realize that he is not aging. She doesn’t confess her love for him, because the love she feels for him is still growing, not as strong and mature as Daniel’s love for her.      One afternoon, Jane meets a journalist named James, who is 20 years old. They met when James was scheduled to interview her. They both come together often, like in bars, café’s and other public places, because they like each other. Everyone thinks they are dating, because the paparazzi follow Jane everywhere. Daniel gets hurt by this and struggles to let her go. He confesses everything to her – where he came from, the reasons for his move, his affair with her mother, and his deep love for her. Jane feels betrayed and hurt, so she stops talking to Daniel, ignoring her love for him. One night, while Daniel was thinking about everything he’s done with his life, he drifts off to his death, since he already fulfilled his calling – to love with all his heart.      Jane hears of Daniel’s death and grieves because of the ugliness of her last words to him that day he confessed to her. Peter and Clarisse are now really old and can’t remember anything. Jane, with James, organizes Daniel’s funeral, since he was her ‘second father’. She writes a book about love, the way it was shown to her by Daniel. Jane and James live happily ever after, with the knowledge of what true love is supposed to be.

I think I've grown up not liking it because when i was younger I had a reading problem and the school I was in basically told me I couldn't. Or something like that. I am a slower reader and I can't really read novels or "big books" haha. Ever book i've ever started to read I just got bored or they made it into a movie LOL!! Some books that I do like to read are The Boxcar Children, Left Behind: the kids series, I also like Cam Jansen, and Junie B, Jones, but I'd like to read on a little higher level. So if any one could help me find some books that I would like that are not on Highschool level. I really don't mind reading kiddy books, just as long as I'm reading.     Ok, same question but for a 13 year old. He likes Bionicle, Scooby doo, and Batman.      Ps. I'm a girl, and the 13 year old is a boy. I like romance and mystery.

I read all of Ellen Hopkins's books about teens with problems (drugs, suicide, abuse, etc) and I fell in love with the way she writes about them in free verse.

20090307121816AA1OuvX	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good first chapter...wrote it myself?	Just Tell me what you think, that's all I ask. If you like it visit sadiesstory.webs.com and sadieraecollins.webs.com   Chapter 1   New Kids   If someone randomly walked up to you one day and whispered in you ear as they passed that they didn’t kill your best friend, you might be a little scared; am I right?   This is exactly what happened to me on what should have been an ordinary December morning, and yes, I was terrified. I soon came to realize that my world was never and would never be, ordinary. Nothing like this ever happens to other people. For some strange reason beyond explanation, unnatural stuff always tends to target me.   It all started on my last normal morning. It was mid November, the 21st to be exact (my birthday). The air was cold and brutal. Everyone in school was wearing sweaters, sweatpants, jeans, basically anything to keep warm. There were, of course, a few slutty girls who didn’t care whether or not they were cold, just that they looked good. I was all for cheating the dress code but they were a little extreme. I was in homeroom waiting for my best friend in the entire universe, Marissa, to come in. She was one of those girls with bright pink hair and had the personality of someone who didn’t care what the hell other people said about them so long as they enjoyed themselves. Know that type?   If you do, don’t judge them. They are amazing in their own special ways; most of those ways involving dirty minds and strange, evil laughs.   We officially met on our 6th grade field trip to Caramoor. She was in my homeroom then too. That day was insanely hot, and it was making us all sweat like crazy and smell horrible. Everyone was complaining and moaning about how they didn’t want to be there. We had been on this trip for three times in a row now. We passed a big patch of weeds that had strayed out of the forest, slinking out of the damp trees towards us. Marissa pointed to the weeds and shouted out, “LOOK MARIJUANA!” Everyone burst out laughing. Later, I cornered her and told her how gutsy that was for her to say.   “Really?” She said. “Everyone always ignores me. They think I’m weird.”   “I think you’re amazing!”   And so we became friends.   Anyway, back to the school day. Marissa ran into the classroom and handed me a small black box with a blood red bow tied around it.   “Here, here!” She squealed excitedly. “Happy Birthday, Holly! Open it, open it!”   I grinned at her and tore at the ribbon, carefully pulling off the lid. Inside was a diamond shaped necklace, dark blue at the top and fading to a light aquamarine at the bottom. A delicate face was carved into it, its eyes closed, its lips curved up ever so slightly. It was attached to an old fashioned long black leather cord, it was stunning.   “Ohmigod!” I whispered, speechless. I looked up at her anticipating expression. I tested to see how strong it was, pulling on the sting. I got up from my desk and handed the necklace to her, moving my hair from my neck so she understood what I wanted, I was still stunned. She tied the cord around my neck and let go, it landed right were my v-necked shirt began. I took the charm in my palm and examined it from every angle, finally getting my breath back; I tilted my head back up to Marissa and smiled so wide my jaw started to hurt. “Ohmigod! Marissa! It’s amazing! Thank you!” My voice was so loud I was almost screaming. I put my arms around her, grabbing her in a gigantic bear hug. Again I held the charm in my palm, noticing how cold it felt. “It must have cost a fortune” I said frowning; I didn’t like the idea of her spending so much money on me. “Where’d you buy it?”   “The thrift store down in Tarrytown. Some old guy sold it to me really cheap. He seemed eager to get rid of it, in fact. I cant imagine why. It is fabulous.” She smiled like she had just won the lottery.   Just as I was about to thank her again, they came in. The teachers had told us that there were four new students coming. Everyone had been anticipating the day when they arrived, but nobody had known the exact date. So, when they walked in, nobody was prepared.   I swear to God if there had been entrance music the song probably would have been Cruella Devil. The boy about to leave the classroom stepped aside and opened the door wider for them; his eyes glazed over as the one wearing a black fedora hat blew him a kiss.   The one farthest to the right was tall, slender, and had an hourglass figure. She had long, flowing blonde curls for hair; it reached all the way to her non-existent waist. She wore a brown corduroy mini-miniskirt and white tights with brown knitted boots. She had a pink and white striped, tight-fitted, long-sleeved top on. Her eyes were wide, innocent, and a strange bright purple color. She was smiling brightly and giggling to herself.   The girl on the left was tall too, with light brown pin-straight hair that hung slightly past her shoulders and bangs that made her look like a shaggy dog, a very pretty shaggy dog. She had the sam

I'm 16 and i'm writing the first book in my series.Please don't comment on grammatical errors,i'll fix them later.I want to know whether you feel interested or not?      Chapter 1         Elliot crow gasped inside his bed. The air inside the room grew denser in this sultery, summer night. Sweeping the sweat off his forehead, Elliot sat at the edge of his bed and looked around at the silent room. The window was closed.      Elliot took a draught of cold water from the plastic bottle at his side, then he strolled to the window.After he opened the shutters he sniffed the humid air trying to find any sort of coolness inside of the air.      "Dad"      A young boy came walking through the open door. He was in his stripped pajamas,with his brownish hair all disheveled over his round, pale face.      "victor.Why are you awake at such time?. It's nearly three in the morning. Are you ok?".Elliot approached his son, and held him up,hugging him inside his brawny arms.      "Nothing Dad.I'm just a bit afraid.I had a nightmare in which I saw monster.He wanted to swallow me"      "Oh Gosh"Elliot smiled at victor as he laid him in his bed, then adjusted the pillow over his head.       "And what did you do??".Elliot sat next to victor with his arm propped against his pillow,and his fingers running through Victor's damp hair.      "I did nothing.I just woke up.It seemed that as the monster approached me I realized I was dreaming,so I woke up."      "don't worry victor.Here,take this"      Elliot dug his hans deep into the thigh pocket of his blue trousers,and took out a heart shaped locket.The locket had a silver strap that clinked as Elliot slid the locket into victor's neck.      Victor raised the locket in his small palm,and opened it.There was Elliot's picture beaming at Victor out of a black and white picture.      "Do you like it ?"      "yeah Dad ."      "turn it"      Victor turned the locket.On it's back a sentence was carved.Victor squinted to read the interwoven letters.      "read it aloud".   'I'll always be with you"Victor spoke out the sentence,then peeped back at his father.      "it's great"      Victor  shooted at his father's arms,and kissed him twice in the shoulder.      A fit of laughter,tickling,and kicking went on for minutes.Victor wished the laughter went on forever,but he knew,even at five years old,that everything had an end.      "stop..". Elliot whispered forcing victor to stop hopping      As the smile on victor's face faded away ,Elliot was already brushing all over the room. Victor knew from the keen expression on his face that his ears where trying to catch a certain voice that he didn't hear      Elliot turned his sight to the open window.There was a strange breath sound coming into the room.Elliot rushed to the window,nd poked his head.But before he turned his head to examine the left side a whirring of wings seemed to approach his head,and a crackling shill scream came splashing the window panes.      Elliot fell to his rear.      "Hide quickly Victor.Hide in the wardrobe"      Victor dashed to the wardrobe leaving its door ajar.      The shrill scream,along with the whirring of the wings subsided into the silence of the night.Elliot was about to gesture at victor to come out of the wardrobe,but the thunderous scream came back much more raucous.         As Elliot walked backward unconscious of what was happening,a triangular head came forward out of the window.It was the head of a dragon.      The dragon squeezed him self effortlessly through the narrow,rectangular window.His body was as flexible as dough.      Elliot gazed at the man who was perching over the dragon's back. After the man stroked the dragon's  scaly red neck smoothly, he untethered his legs from the saddle and leaped to the wooden floor.      "you weren't expecting me Elliot?"      The man gestured at the dragon with his gloved hands.The dragon flopped to the ground the wooden floor that creaked under his weight.His thorned tail writhed in circles behind him as if a living snake was fixed to his back.      Victor has nearly fainted at the sight of the dragon.He didn't whether what was happening was a part of his nightmare or real.He slapped himself several times before he decided that he was awake and gazed back through the small crack.   The voice of the man was shrill as his dragon but much colder.Victor couldn’t diverge his attention from his weird attire.A black jeans emblemed with grey skulls.A green leather coat its two sides strapped together with a lace that was stuffed with all kinds of knives and pointy ,short stacks.The diverse collection seemed similar to that of a surgent.His face was long,Full of scars,and lifeless.       "Where's the griffin crow"      "what griffin Morphew"      Elliot moved toward Morphew.      "not again Crow you know what I'm speaking about.I know that Fyrfax isn't dead"      Elliot's eyes widened at these words. How could Morphew Know about his plan? How could he divulge the secret of the griffin.T he secret that he worked on fabricating for the last two years. Eve

This isn't just teenagers I'm talking about, it's adults as well. So many times I've seen 'they're' spelt as 'their', or vice versa. And the whole 'your' instead of 'you're' thing seems to be an epidemic! I get so irked when I see that, especially in people's stories. Grammar seems to be losing its value.      -Sarah.

20090307122659AAQcZ0S	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Which book is this?! please help :)?	I read it a really long time ago ..      It's about this girl who's parents were the rulers of a country. Her uncle (I think) led a revolt and murdered her parents. She was then given a potion to make her infertile, so that her cousin sister (the daughter of the evil uncle) would become the ruler. As a child/teen, she meets this guy in the woods; he is some sort of a scientist, I think. He ends up doing something with steam to heat up the palace?      Some other random details I remember:   - She always wears black.    - The word cat/kat is somehow significant; I think it was what 'Queen' was called in that land    - She does end up getting pregnant despite the potion   - There is some cleansing ritual within the book   - At one point, they are in the square, and some man is being beheaded. The queen has to touch her lips to the chalise filled with blood. It's part of the custom or something ...      So there we go! I'd love to re-read the book, but can't remember its title or author for the life of me! It was something I randomly picked up in the library :)      Thanks!!

These names will be their "Human" names. :)      Cat one: He's the older cat, He loves to play. You can’t tell by the pictures but he has amazing green eyes. He sometimes gets a little crazy and chases things that are not there, and knocks things down all the time. He eats food that is human food like Cheetos's and he strangely loves to eat ferret food. He tries very hard to get food out of the ferrets cage by sticking his paw in the cage, and dragging her food tray closer towards him into he can scoop some food out. He sleeps in strange places like the bathroom sink, by the stove(he jumps up and sits on the counter top by the stove), my laptop, and then normal places like the back of the couch, and my bed. He also likes to be lint brushed, and go into the fridge when the door is open.       http://s237.photobucket.com/albums/ff257...        http://s237.photobucket.com/albums/ff257...       Cat Two: He’s shy, but he used to be bold. He has amazing golden eyes. He runs away from most people, and gets scared of noises easily. He meows when he wants my attention. He is smaller than the first cat, and has many scratches because the neighborhood cats pick on him. He likes to copy his brother a lot. He tries to go in the fridge when its open. He sleeps in normal places like my chair, my bed, the couch, and the case for my laptop which lays on the floor under the table.       http://s237.photobucket.com/albums/ff257...        http://s237.photobucket.com/albums/ff257...

I was thinking of making each of the uncle's children represent the 7 deadly sins.(except his youngest 8th blind chilld who's more like the main character)      Here's an example on two of the uncle's children and some details I wrote about them:         [2nd male cousin named Oscar represents Gluttony, he's over 300 pounds, and during a party he rapes and kills an aspiring actress, apparently his weight crushed her. He then is so taken by her beauty that he takes pictures of her corpse and posts it on the internet]      [3rd female cousin is named Sarah, she represents envy, has gotten plastic surgery done a number of times to look like people she envied, finds the pictures of the girl her brother Oscar kille and is soo jealous of her she prints the picture and gets surgury done to look like her. When she returns home, she bumps into Oscar and gives him a heart, attack killing him.]

Fever bright,   desperate with need,   she clutched the monster's arm.      With dying breath and waning strength,   she pleaded with the being,   for the one life left to her.      Her only child fought to survive,   but, her heart knew the battle was already lost.   Since, heaven refused her pleas,   she reached for the only help left.      This creature, whose name filled the pious with dread,   was her son's only hope,   and she'd damn her own soul to obtain it.      "Save him!" She demanded, sacrificing her final moments   to command with a mother's fervor.   "you must!" She whispered as she sank back, her eyes closing forever.      "I will."

20090307165733AAt6Cde	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A very touching poem to hear ?	I was so happy about the new house we had found.    For once in my life, I was on the right side of town.    I unpacked my things with great ease.    As I watched my new curtains blow in the breeze.       How wonderful it was to have my own room.    School would be starting, I'd have friends over soon.    There'd be sleep-overs, and parties; I was so happy.    It's just the way I wanted my life to be.       On the first day of school, everything went great.    I made new friends and even got a date!    I thought, "I want to be popular and I'm going to be,    because I just got a date with the star of the team!"       To be known in this school you had to have a clout,    and dating this guy would sure help me out.    There was only one problem stopping my fate.    My parents had said I was too young to date.       "Well, I just won't tell them the entire truth.    They won't know the difference, what's there to loose?"    I asked to stay with my friends that night.    My parents just frowned and said, "All right."       Excited, I got ready for the big event,    but as I rushed around like I had no sense,    I began to feel guilty about all the lies.    But what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride?       Well, the pizza was good, and the party was great,    but the moonlight ride would have to wait.    For Jeff was half drunk by this time    But he kissed me and said that he was just fine.       Then the room filled with smooke and Jeff took a puff.    I couldn't believe he was smoking that stuff.    Now Jeff was ready to ride to the point    but only after he'd smoked another joint.       We jumped in the car for the moonlight ride,    not thinking that he was too drunk to drive.    We finally made it to the point at last,    and Jeff started trying to make a pass.       A pass is not what I wanted at all    (and pass, I don't mean playing football).    "Perhaps maybe my parents were right...maybe I am too young    Boy, how could I ever, ever be so dumb."       With all of my might, I pushed Jeff away:    "Please take me home, I don't want to stay."    Jeff cranked up the engine and floored the gas.    In a matter of seconds we were going too fast.       As Jeff drove on in a fit of wild anger,    I knew my life was in danger.    I begged and pleaded for him to slow down,    but he just got faster as we neared the town.       "Just let me go home! I'll confess that I lied.    I really went out for a moonlight ride."    Then all of the sudden, I saw a big flash.    "Oh God, Please help us! We're going to crash!"       I don't remember the force of the impact.    Just that everything all of the sudden went black.    I felt someone remove me from the twisted rubble, and heard,    "Call an ambulance! These kids are in trouble!"       Voices I heard, a few words at best.    But I knew there were two cars involved in the wreck.    Then wondered to myself if Jeff was all right.    And if the people in the other car were alive.       I woke in the hospital to faces so sad.    "You've been in a car wreck and it looks pretty bad"    These voices echoed inside my head,    as they gently told me Jeff was dead.       They said "We've done all we can do.    But it looks as if we'll lose you too."    "But the people in the other car!?" I cried,    "We're sorry, but they also died," I prayed,    "God forgive me for what I've done,    I only wanted to have just one night of fun."       "Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim,    and I wish I could return their families to them."    "Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied.    and that it's my fault so many have died.       Oh nurse, won't you please tell them that for me?"    The nurse just stood there she never agreed.    But took my hand with tears in her eyes    and a few minutes later, I died.       A man asked the nurse, "Why didn't you do your best    to bid that girl on her last request?"    She looked at the man with eyes so sad.    "Because the people in the other car were her mom and dad."       This story is sad and unpleasant but true. So young people take to heed, this could happen to you.
20090307161632AAQqFvw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is the prologue to my story good enough?	This is most likely not really it,it's a test prologue,but it's the basic idea. However,if it's okay,I'll use it.         -------------------------   What a beautiful town.   Warm weather in the spring. Mildly hot summer days. Breezy autumn afternoons. Cool winter days. Clear white snow in the winter. Auburn and yellow leaves in autumn. Dark green grass and leaves all spring and summer...How cliche is that?   This town is too perfect,too happy. Everyone's happy all year long,everyone knows each other. This town needs something odd,something freaky. Something unique..I wish someone would come and change that all. Sometimes,I just wish someone would go and take me away from this town forever.   -----------------------         Foreshadowing,yayz! That was meant to be a few months before the beginning of the story,like in February(the story begins in early July).      It's supposed to be in first person,and that's the way she talks and thinks. Like a..Um,she has a different way of thinking.      Anyway,is it okay? >< I don't think so,maybe I'm just being hard on myself.  I'm not good with prologues.
20090307164000AAGfvVy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The Fall of the House of Usher question?	Ok, so, when the Narrator and Roderick saw Madeline in the doorway after she supposedly came out of the coffin, was that their imaginations playing tricks on them? Because there was no way she could have gotten out of a coffin that was bolted down. She was sick and she hadnt had water for several days. It was windy that night, and the sounds they were hearing were probably from the wind knocking things over in the house, and the house itself creaking. And Rodericks insanity rubbed off on the Narrator, so were they both just imagining Madeline in the doorway? And did Roderick have a heart attack and die from this imagination?

20090307163653AAeePJ0	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	A Question about Graphic Designers?	Okay. So I'm a junior, and I've been thinking about being a graphic designer when I grow up. I always thought they made a nice decent amount of pay, and I considered going to FIT (Fashion Institute of Technology) for college.      But then my dad stated that being a graphic designer will get me nowhere. Initially, I thought "whatever..." since he compared me to my brother playing poker which is pretty exaggerated (He said that we are both focusing on the wrong things). So I told him that even my uncle's wife went to FIT and is doing pretty well in life. BUTTT he then told me that the reason why she's doing well is because her brother bought her apartment and the apartment wasn't really even meant for her but for her parents. And that she was even a college drop out before going to FIT, which means she considered FIT as a last resort college.      My dad says that he doesn't want to waste money on tuition on a career choice that will get me nowhere in life. But I'm thinking to myself, "aren't there some good graphic designers out there?" I feel that I would not be useful in any other career. I don't see myself as an engineer. I don't see myself as a doctor. I don't see myself as a lawyer or some person in finance.       I want to be, honestly, a comic artist, but I think that I'll take that as I side job. I told him that I'm serious about being a graphic designer, but he keeps on saying that me and my brother are just trying to find ways to make life fun and will end up with a hard life with no house, no car, etc etc etc. OF COURSE LIFE WILL BE HARD. =_='      So a question about graphic designers: How much money do they usually make? And who are some examples of good graphic designers? (He told me to list some and of course I replied "I don't know!")      And also. Is FIT (Fashion Institute of Technology) a bad school? It's a state art/fashion related college in New York.

20090307164907AAS5Sxe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Comments please on piece from novel?	Daisy skipped out to her father who stood waiting in the drive. The dogs had gone on ahead. Robin strode out, his legs, long and loose, took his lean body farther with each step than Daisy could keep up with.  She ran instead, so that she was in front of him, not knowing where they were going but thrilled to be there, out in the hills, with him. They’d climbed a steep incline from where she could see the Sound of Jura in the distance, and where the early evening haze had blurred the view of the distant Morvern hills. It was then she saw her. They’d come up over the brow of the hill and Mrs. Loft was just there, leaning against a standing stone, a Pyrenean mountain dog on her feet and two Pekinese yapping tunelessly as she clapped.  Daisy stopped about ten feet away. Why is she clapping, she wondered.  Robin went over and Daisy saw Mrs Loft’s left eyebrow rise up in enquiry.    “Robin,” she said. “And Deirdre. What a surprise.”   “I’m Daisy,” said Daisy.    Robin laughed. “Well, it’s a recent thing, isn’t it, Daisy? I mean, you were christened Deirdre.”   “But that’s a horrible name. I’m Daisy now. It suits me better.”   “It’s utterly charming,” said Mrs Loft. “And it suits you perfectly.”   Daisy, smitten, beamed her widest smile at her.  Mrs Loft was lovely. She had dark hair swept carelessly into a chignon, and her lips were mysteriously darker at the edges where her lipstick met the rest of her face. The effect was beguiling. Her teeth were white and even and she had one of those smiles that didn’t show all her teeth, not fully, so she never appeared to be grinning. She had a silk square knotted beneath her chin and several rings on her fingers. She even had one on her thumb. And her wellies were green, like they should be, not black, like Daisy’s. Daisy ambled over, stopped close to her Dad.   “Daisy’s going back to school tomorrow,” said Robin to Mrs Loft.   He had raised his voice above the yapping of the Pekes who were sniffing around Honey and Sally, who didn’t seem to mind. Maybe they’d met before.    “Oh, I am sorry, Daisy,” said Mrs Loft. “I know we haven’t met but I’ve heard about you. I had hoped we could all go for a picnic one day. Did you know I live just over there?” She waved in the general direction of loch Dubh. “That makes me your new neighbour. Did your father tell you?”   “Daisy, this is Mrs Loft. Cheryl. And it’s true, Cheryl’s recently moved into the old farmhouse. She’s converting it into holiday cottages.”   “It’s not just a commercial enterprise. It will be our home as well. Mine and Fiona’s.”   “Who’s Fiona?” said Daisy.   “My daughter. I’m sure you’ll meet her in the summer.”   “How old is she?”    “A bit older than you, I think. She’s fourteen. She’s staying with her father at the moment. She goes back to school soon, too.”    “Oh,” said Daisy. “What school does she go to?”   “Well, it’s a ballet school. In England.”   “Oh.”   “I’m sure you’ll have lots of fun when you meet in the summer, Daisy. I’ll arrange a picnic when you’re both here. We could take all the dogs – they seem to like each other, don’t they?” She dropped to her haunches and roughly stroked Honey with one arm while she picked up one of the Pekes in the other. “Would you like that?”   “Yes, thank you. That would be nice,” said Daisy. She turned to her father. “Come on, Daddy, let’s go - I’m starving.” She turned to Cheryl. “Bye,” she said and clicked two fingers at the Labradors who bounded after her as she ran down the hill. Cheryl put the wriggling Pekinese down and turned to Robin.    “Well, that wasn’t too bad. I think she liked me.”   “How could she not?” said Robin. His eyes held hers. “But yes, I think it didn’t go too badly.” They stood for a moment, smiling at each other. “I’d better go,” he said, turning to watch the shrinking dogs and his toy-sized daughter in the distance who was throwing a stick into the black depths of the loch. “I think we weren’t meant to get muddy,” he said as two golden noses glided through the still water. “Looks like I’ve failed again.”   “Oh Darling.” Cheryl took his hand in hers and squeezed. “Come tomorrow, if you can. I’ll be here. Same time?”   “Nothing would stop me.”   He loped away then, whistling for Honey and Sally as he skirted the loch to avoid it’s boggy shore.  He had enough explaining to do without adding muddy trousers to the problem.

20090307164434AAuKG9f	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Philosophically Speaking....?	Most scientists today are all about the tangible, correct? So if it is not tangible, then it can not possibly be there, real, or present. I guess that explains why there are many scientists.       We have 5 senses:   1. Taste   2. Touch   3. Hear   4. See   5. Smell      These are recognized as the "Senses." ---And so far apart from it, nobody has come up with any other "sense." But has anyone imagined that maybe there is a Sixth Sense? One that is not so much able to tell us about the tangible, but is an instinct that guides us in subtle ways throughout life, and especially in, per say, extreme situations.       Certain things are hard to explain?       People sensing others behind them,   Parents waking up at just the right time to notice that a fire was about to burn down their home,    A young adult leaves the park just about a cougar was about to attack?      What made you leave just at that moment, people later ask?    Well, they say, I just felt like I should leave. That keen perception, that Instinct.       So what do you think. What do you think about a Sixth Sense?

20090307171001AAhPNoP	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	My friend has started a new "philosophy"  in our social group that everyone is following,do you agree with it?	The Philosophy of Intercommunicationism (is that even the correct way to make that into a word lol) Well,she loves Ayn Rand and Objectivism and agrees with it but she says that she wanted to branch it out some more. She's really into psychology and law and whatnot so its not suprising lol.      Intercommunicationism is the idea that everything that you see,hear,touch,or know about subconciously effects you.It is the theory that unless you change something that you feel is wrong,it will bother you. The philosophy encourages its followers to change their world.     The second part of intercommunicationism is that there is no such    thing as intelligence,being a genius or even,being smart. The only way to    truly be knowlegable is to not be ignorant on any subject/topic/idea. To accept this is to accept that we are all ignorant on subjects. It also means that you are damaging yourself by speaking on things that you are ignorant about. To truly follow intercommunicationism you must thrive for knowledge,have the drive to change as much as you can (no matter the magnitude of the change) and most importantly,understand that we were born to learn and that until we accept that not just one human can know everything,we are ignorant and devastating our own intelligence.      Hmm...isn't there already things like this?? IDK,im arguing with her about how stupid this is lol
20090307160516AAvzjN9	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Can you answer my question?	"Can oneself truly achieve inner peace" I believe that this is a myth as mankind is a ever changing life form not physically but mentally and shall do until destruction. Over time mankind has created many perceptions and discoveries which are constantly changing our lives and the way we think about reality so in turn how can oneself truly reach inner peace or  "Enlightenment". Because mankind is the only species we know of that can question our selves and our lifestyle, to achieve inner peace oneself would have to know the answers to every question and anything we could consider questioning and so on. E.G. life after death and our origins which no man will ever no in my opinion. "knowledge we can't comprehend will continue to haunt of very being" which i believe is true so how can we believe that inner peace is attainable its just another one of mans many designs of trying to attain the unattainable. i believe i have answered my answer to the best of my abilities but i still want u to share your opinions. Peace. A quote that i truly believe and will share with you by the great philosopher xenophanes "No human being will ever know the truth, for even if they happen to say it by chance, they would not even known they had done so".

I'm looking for any addicting series to read. i don't really like stories that are way too dark. I'm kinda looking for a mix between Harry Potter/Twilight/Eragon....there's lots of action, mystery, and a little bit of romance and angst. It doesn't really matter if your recommendation doesn't fall under these genres...i'm just looking for something good to read. ; ]      Thanks!
20090307172538AAbHiPL	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Artwork that resembles the modeling industry?	I have to do an english project called the American Portfolio that entails researching how a specific subject has significantly influenced America (or is still affecting America).   My topic is the modeling industry and i am examining the positive and negative sides of the industry...the positive being that it inspires young girls to be fit and have confidence, and it aids the American economy.   The negative side is that it causes health disorders like anorexia, bulimia, and low self esteem because of the "perfect woman" image ideal.      For a specific part of the project, I need to create original artwork that portrays my subject. I can make anything I want, it just has to be original and I have to make it within a day.      Does anyone have any ideas for what I can make?   Thanks to everyone who answers!

It's about a teenage girl with a twin that is mentally challenged and she wants to find a cure for it and while in the process, she wants to create her own t.v. show. I really really LOVED the movie.

What are some other good books like Tru Confessions cause I would really really love to read another book as meaningful, and wonderful as Tru Confessions that teaches you that everyone is different in their own special way and they shouldn't worry about it.

20090307172558AALH9tZ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Really, like no one is answering my questions! Answer this one!?	My ideas for stories don't end. So, help me! And actually HELP. I am sick and tired of getting stupid answers! Don't be stupid, otherwise, you don't deserve the 2 points!!!        The rain wouldn't stop. I stared out the window, praying for it to work. I have never been good at this, but I keep trying.    Focusing on the dark clouds, I whispered the words that would trigger my Gift. "Elleri skun frasca." I repeated it, louder this time. The heat on the tip of my fingers sent waves of pain throughout my body. I was used to it, and I barely noticed now. The heat spread to my palms, and the pain increased. I clenched my teeth together. "Elleri skun frasca," I said again.    The clouds drifted up into the sky, but they did not vanish. "No," I yelled at them. My Gift faded, and I groaned. Clouds are the hardest to control.      I turned my gaze to the never-ending stream of raindrops. My Gift turned on again, and the droplets slowed to a drizzle. I smiled defiantly. It was a start.     "Julie?"    I looked over my shoulder at the person standing in the doorway. It was my sister, Rachel. She is three years older than I am, but we are as close as anything.    She walked across my room, moving around the junk I hadn't cleaned up with ease. She was always so graceful. I wanted to be just like her. She was beautiful, with dark green eyes and long, black hair. My hair was short and messy. Even worse, it was the color of mud. I hated it, but I couldn't do anything with it. It was thick and always tangled. My eyes are a dull brown, as lifeless as I was. Rachel was perfect. I was far from it.     "Having fun?" Rachel leaned against the opposite wall as me and smiled.    "Not really. Even the rain won't listen to me these days."    "I listen to you." She glanced up at the sky, and muttered, "Iskana tonis!"    The rain and clouds were gone. I stared at where they had once been and sighed. "I'll never be as good as you."    "Yes you will." Rachel took my hands in hers and looked deep into my eyes. Hers were full of kindness and love. Mine, I knew, had nothing like the sort in them. "I know you can." Her touch was gentle, and I knew she was right.     "I just don't understand it. Why can't I do it?"    Rachel licked her lips before she spoke. "The words you choose are important. 'Elleri skun frasca' is great, but you should try something different. Maybe 'futura ton rasi' would be better."    I nodded, but I was confused. "How come I can't-"    "Use 'Iskana tonis'?" She laughed, and her laugh reminded me of bells. "You can in a few years, but you need experience."    I rolled my eyes, but I had to smile. "Yeah, like that's going to happen."    Rachel laughed again. "Well, just keep working on it." She left my side, and as she closed the door, I looked back out the window. There were only a few clouds left, and the sun was shining.    Reaching into the depth of my soul for the Gift I had had since birth, I said, "futura ton rasi."    The clouds vanished.

20090307172848AAQeJ1v	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Is this a soliloquy from hamlet?	LORD POLONIUS    Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!   The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,   And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!   And these few precepts in thy memory   See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,   Nor any unproportioned thought his act.   Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.   Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,   Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;   But do not dull thy palm with entertainment   Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware   Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,   Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.   Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;   Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.   Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;   For the apparel oft proclaims the man,   And they in France of the best rank and station   Are of a most select and generous chief in that.   Neither a borrower nor a lender be;   For loan oft loses both itself and friend,   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.   This above all: to thine ownself be true,   And it must follow, as the night the day,   Thou canst not then be false to any man.   Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

Any thing I could improve on?  If you have any ideas please say so.      It was the most magnificent cupcake Taylor had ever seen.  It was a chocolate cupcake with bright pink frosting topped with rainbow colored sprinkles sitting in a bakery window in London.  Taylor could almost smell it’s freshness through the glass window.  It was perfect and she just had to have it.  She pulled a penny from the pocket of her tattered dress.  She had been saving since she found it on the ground two days ago.  And spending it on the cupcake would be perfect.  Taylor stepped away from the window and walked inside the bakery.  She walked straight to the baker and asked for the chocolate cupcake with pink frosting to go.    The baker looked at her strangely and said, “Yes, but may I ask where your parents are?”    Taylor didn’t even have to think about this question.  She had told everyone who asked her that the same thing.  Taylor quickly answered, “Oh, they are just standing outside waiting for me.”      The Baker was a little hesitant, but finally said okay and proceeded to get the little girl her cupcake.  After the baker handed her the cupcake, she handed him a penny and said thank you.  She then turned around and walked out of the tiny bakery.  The first thing she wanted to do was devour her cupcake.  Taylor went and sat down on a bench which was stained with graffiti.  She stared at her cupcake wondering where to start.  She eats her cupcake slowly, savoring every bite, knowing that she may not have another bite of food for a while.    She finishes off her last bite, full with satisfaction.  She quickly realizes that it’s getting dark and she should get going.  Taylor wraps up her bag and throws it in a nearby garbage.  She then starts walking towards an abandoned warehouse where she has been sleeping for the past month.  As she is walking she thinks about Hamilton Orphanage, the orphanage she ran away from.  Thinking about how much she hated it there; but at the same time, wondering if it would be better than where she is at now.  Taylor thinks about this every night as she walks back to the warehouse.  Every night she agrees that she will never go back there again.  Always hoping for something better, that maybe, one day, she will find her parents.  She shakes the thought from her head, and focusing back on where she’s going.  She wants to get back before the cops start coming out at night, so she starts walking swiftly.  She finally arrives to the warehouse, goes upstairs, lies down, and falls asleep almost instantly.  While she is sleeping, Taylor has a dream about finding her parents.  In her dream, they had been looking for her for 13 years.  On her 13th birthday she makes a wish, and the next day her parents miraculously find her after all those years.    Taylor wakes up with a startle.  She blinks her eyes a couple of times looking for her parents, but all she sees is the cold empty warehouse around her.  Just then she realizes it was just a dream and starts to cry.  Suddenly hears a grumble in her stomach and remembers she hasn’t eaten since yesterday afternoon.  She remembers that the food drive isn’t open on Sundays.  She wipes her tears away with the sleeve of her old dress.  For Taylor this dream had occurred more than once.  She gets up from the floor and makes her way down the stairs, outside.  She starts walking into town.  As she walks to town, she searches the ground, looking for lost change.  She doesn’t find any change as she reaches town.  Once again her stomach grumbles.  She looks around and sees bread bakery.  She thinks for a little bit.  She knows her idea is crazy, but she’s desperate.  She slowly walks into the bakery.  The baker asks her if there is anything he can help her find.  Taylor replies no and keeps looking.  She grabs a small loaf of bread and looks it over. She starts to walk towards the door and stops.  She stands there for about a minute.  The baker seems a little suspicious.  Taylor finally runs for it.  She runs faster than she ever had before in her life.  She hears the baker screaming after her, and hears his loud footsteps trailing her.  He was almost on her heels.  Suddenly Taylor feels the bakers hand on her shoulder as she falls to the ground beneath her.      “Why would you steal my bread?” the baker yells as he turns the girl over.      She’s scared and crying as she replies, “I’m an orphan and I don’t have anywhere to stay, or any money to buy food.”    The man suddenly feels sorry and helps the girl up.  She is still crying.  As she stands up, a locket falls from her neck.     The man bends over to pick it up off the ground. Taylor starts to cry harder and explains to the man that the locket and her clothes are the only two things she owns.  He asks where she got it.   “I was found at the orphanage with it.”, Taylor replies, wiping her tears.   On the front of th
