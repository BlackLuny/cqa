dcFbJOEraa	well i don't think it weird. its a natural thing about feeling something for the guy whom you kissed. its the feeling of kiss that makes you think of him again n again. well just be normal. try n go out with your friends or with some other guy. i think you feel attach to him because you are alone at this point of time. if you find someone i don't think you will think of this guy. so find a decent guy for yourself you will keep you happy. keep :)
SupWrLRIaa	I don't see what there is to not get. She feels unwanted because you turned her down. She offered you what she felt was a very special gift, something she could only give once, and you turned her down flat. I am not saying I disagree with your reasons, but from her perspective that has to sting. Particularly for women, in American society at least, sex is a symbol. She is offering herself to you, her physical body but also her spirit, her heart, and you said no. Symbolically, in her mind, you turned *her* down, not just *sex with her* down.     Now, if she knew about your religious leanings a long time ago, then the blame is mostly on her. She should have known you were not into that long ago. If she didn't, then you are almost exclusively to blame, because while 8 months may be "not long at all" it is well into the "serious relationship" portion of the spectrum and the religion conversation should have happened the better part of a year ago. I have never had a girlfriend last three months without talking about that, and my leanings are not nearly so relationship-oriented as, say, celibacy until marriage. At this point you need to text her something heartfelt trying to explain that you didn't mean to turn your nose up at her gift, and why you did it, and then leave it be until she calms down. She will read it once, be angry, read it another 200 times, and eventually realize that you aren't trying to be dismissive. Hopefully.|`|eNpnvpSbaa	exactly how old are you all ........ maybe her friends are doing it and she wants to do it too|`|JY5Az7X1aa	Sex is not the ultimate display of love and care. If religion is important to you than good for you. In fact, if she does not respect you enough to wait  too than maybe she doesn't really love you like she says. But don't lose hope, seriously ALMOST ALL couples have this argument. She'll call you back it takes time.|`|ZVfxJacvaa	Sounds like she's pressuring you, honestly. If she loved you like you loved her there wouldn't be a problem. Honestly, if two people are in love, what's now as apposed to when you're married? Do yourself a favor and don't talk to her unless she comes around and says she was wrong. Because I feel she is. And I myself am I girl, and I believe you should wait too. I'm 19, a virgin, and damn proud! Hope I helped.|`|NrbLdZzOaa	You didnt tell her your beliefs like...8 months ago?    She has every right to be upset if you just dropped that on her.|`|26c154b69baa8aa4faf85a634112c1aeaa	sorry dude but some women are that horny 24 /7|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	dude what is your problem.. screw religious beliefs|`|UtrgRjTeaa	To her, sex is about expressing love. To you, sex is about being in a lifelong commitment. Fundamentally, she's disappointed that sex doesn't mean the same thing to you. To her, the fact that you're not willing to have sex with her says that you don't want to express your love to her (or that your love isn't strong enough to be expressed that way), which is why she's hurt. But to you, the fact that you're trying to save it for marriage IS the way that you're expressing your love for her. Both of you need to understand what sex means to the other person. Sit down and have a talk about all of this. See if there's a way that you can express your love to her that will mean as much to her as the sex would, without violating your own beliefs.    Good luck!|`|PoTY8CNFaa	Get a male prostitute for her and say you paid for it with the ultimate power of love. Film it and sell the tape for millions!|`|7519e10677e4f1ca5363e860ade206d0aa	get her something sweet for valantine's ; she ll know how much u love her  invite her for a dinner with ur family; she ll know that u r serious with her  then when the time is right; it ll happen|`|aZT9VjZYaa	You have very strong beliefs and you should stick by these. Sex is a thing that does not need to be shared till both people feel they are ready and if you have that strong of beliefs then you are not ready. Don't let her push you into doing the wrong thing by yourself because it will only ruin the relationship.  Hope this helps.|`|asGwQQWfaa	if she can not respect what you believe in she might not be worth your time. most girls wish there where more men out there like you. stay true to what you believe in because you will regret doing something you did not want to do.|`|D2M5iERjaa	if she loves you and wants to be with u she would respect the fact that u will not have sex before u are married if she cant accept that than sorry to tell u she ain't the right girl for u|`|1bfo3ujzaa	dont give in man if shes not whilling to wait for you go out and find yourself a good girl... before its too late
uFeWJtoaaa	try talking to her during class about something random... if your shy then ask a question to the general area of people around you... then look at her for an opinion... you never know if you dont try...|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Honestly, meeting eyes doesn't really tell you anything. If she's in your class, it's the perfect opportunity to speak to her and find out. If she talks back to you, responds well, there's a chance she likes you.     A good (and easy) ice breaker would be asking her something about homework. Then build on her reply. So if she says, 'yeah, but it was kind of difficult', then talk about how you got confused and ask her advice, or drift off onto what you'd rather have done last night instead of homework. Conversation should flow.     But honestly, you don't know whether someones likes you or not until there's definite flirting going on. Get acquainted with her and see how things develop. When you know her, it'll be easier to trust your gut judgement. Good look. =D|`|fJgt7ZXbaa	if u know any of her friends....talk with them  or if ur guy friends know her friends ask them to talk with her friends so u can maybe fully meet in school then say ur goin 2 the movies with ur gu friends n invite her...|`|PULBJUCNaa	i don't thing so she likes u , most of the girls r making ice contact
70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	Nothing. "We all have a right to love and happiness." My motto. ;)|`|BSXqHI6iaa	i think there's nothing wrong with it??? as long as they both love each other. . the wrong might on how will other people accept their status specially thier age, , because it rarely happen right? but i think. . . if people will just open their mind regarding with this type of situation. . i think no one will be crying . . specially for those who are engage with this type of relationship. .   I mean who cares??? they are in love!! and we can't judge them on what they feel to each other . . everyone has the right to choose who ever they want to be with!!!     and i'm proud of those people who's in that situation specially those young guys who deeply fell inlove with an older women. . (ofcourse except for those "gold diggers")=)|`|m16gf9mzaa	Morally wrong?  Nothing.      As for practical matters of having an easy relationship, it is no more wrong than a 43 yr. old man being with a 24 yr. old woman.  Compatibility is made easier by having similar maturity levels and being in similar stages of life.  With that great an age difference, it is far too likely that they are not on the same level or at the same stage of life.  That does not make it wrong or impossible, just difficult and improbable.      Also in terms of maturity level, one has to hope that it is a case of the 24 yr. old being extremely mature for his or her age, rather than the 43 yr. old being immature.      I hope you are asking this as someone who might potentially participate in such a relationship, because if you are asking about someone else, please remember that it is really not your business.|`|6X1hJeZYaa	Ha well its a young man with a old women....LOL..|`|eNpnvpSbaa	nothing|`|UtrgRjTeaa	Nothing. Why?    Caveat: If she is his professor, boss, advisor, supervisor, or in any other position of authority above him, the relationship would be a conflict of interest, and is probably unethical. But otherwise there's nothing wrong with it.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	so its not your husband that has changed sounds like you have found a different interest
EXisORX2aa	It's a stupid taboo that guys should make the first move.|`|661f39420372e21b090f02f05da73dfaaa	Women like to be wooed and men like to take the lead its just the way it is. Wait till you are older and there are less available men in your age group things do change women get a lot more aggressive.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	I've never been afraid or too shy to make the first move. But I've always been an outgoing, confident person in general.    With most girls, the old "double standard" of waiting for the guy to make the first move, still applies, even today.    With regards to a previous answer, above... "The Dirty Sailor" could also be right in his observation.|`|Z11WL8U8aa	People say it makes girls look desperate, but it also makes guys look like whores. I think which ever person wants the relationship the most should make the first move instead of playing hard to get.|`|NrbLdZzOaa	They do...often    Maybe you arent getting stared at, you're getting stared past.|`|QtaPF83iaa	I was always scared that either he or everyone else would think I was a slut.|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	yeah they do... sigh* thats the way life goes|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Theres a few girls who step up in the plate, but rarely.|`|G1OJNCF4aa	Because it's become so common for guys too. I get too self conscious to make the first move or even talk to people. Most girls are, so boost up there confidence and smile or say hi.|`|8WZkicbVaa	Because as girls, we have always been told to let guy chase us and to let them make the first move.   If a guy is interested then he will make the first move!|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	It's cause BITCHES BE CRAZY!    'nuff said.|`|kfNBVZH6aa	For me if i make the first move it seems like I'm desperate it's not that I haven't before I've and it went fine but What if the guy isn't interested If he was he would of said hi or something first you know. Idk but a guy being rejected is different for a girl! And when a girl stares at you alot they want the guy to notice them and talk to them well it depends doesn't mean they like you either!!|`|7mGN5xU1aa	mmm..  yea they do|`|o1ibwPKPaa	A lot of girls have really low self confidence and it's just well known for guys to make the first move. Many girls don't want to seem desperate and like a "whore" I guess.|`|jrXdmAxqaa	cause they got vaginas|`|3WfAOPD9aa	PRIDE|`|Ddfff5psaa	I never have made the first move, to be honest a lot of girls are very self concious, even the most beautiful girls are.  Also we are USED to guys coming up to us, I personally don't feel the need to make the first move. I guess that's a little old fashioned but why would we make the first move and risk looking desperate or needy?|`|4Z8wogroaa	it is a taboo thing.  most girls think that guys are supposed to make the first move.|`|SLiGpyoqaa	How come girls never make the first move?  Well, how many times have you watched a movie or a TV show where the girl asks the guy out? Yes, it does happen, but generally its left up to the guy because it's more 'traditional', such as asking for a prom date.    The girls want the guy to do the work! Who knows why? Maybe girls don't realize that they're not the only ones afraid of rejection, too! For all you know, the girls that have been looking at you might lack of self-confidence and struggle to come up to you.    Help them out and make the first move yourself!|`|labcgcBbaa	well,im a girl,from my point of view.. i think they're just sorta scared that the guy won't want to talk to them or something? Maybe they think,that the guy could think that they're weird or something.  i dk,maybe thats why?|`|h30HmxJHaa	Because we're "desperate" if we make the first move and we think guys are supposed to chase us. When we grow up and get smart, we make the first move.|`|vcykdwNBaa	I concure with the vagina statement. :)|`|mNDimov6aa	home boy said girls shoudl always play hard to get. i agree and disagree if they are interested they should be easy to approach and be pleasant in the first conversation. then once established should be hard to get past that. but yeah i dunno were im from its not a big deal for girls to walk up and say hi, i get it a few times a night at the bar. but those girls ar normally not the ones u should be interested in|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	becuase we are scard that you guys might bring us down in rejection...|`|WYGV3Ujcaa	It's because they don't want to say the wrong thing.|`|U8gIdoXFaa	What would you think of a girl who came on to you? Would you think she was 'easy' ?     Unfortunately, as much as some guys think it would be neat for the girl to come on to them for a change, the main reason she doesn't is because she will be judged..... Its not your fault, nor is it the fault of modern day men in general. Its their forebears that drummed it into us, and as liberal as we all like to think we are, this behaviour will still more often than not label a girl a slut.|`|5vwxFbeIaa	I make the first move with flirtatious staring and batting those lashes.  That's as far as I'll go when it comes to making the first move.  In my opinion a "real" gentleman should make the first physical gesture of greetings.  Being "that" guy who makes the first move will really separate you from the herd.  Giving you an advantage ;)  Although, they did release a survey in Cosmopolitan that 80% of guys nowadays like it when the girl makes the first move.    Oh well.  I'm a bit old fashioned.  Besides, you have no idea what going out of your way to talk to a girl does to her ego.  It'll really start you off on good terms.|`|d3407bb7e70be0ec132046c62291b987aa	You have to look at this from the point-of-view of the girl.  What do guys say to each other about a girl who is aggressive or forward? The guys say things like she is easy, she is a slut, or worse. If you remember the character of Rizzo from the movie/play GREASE, Rizzo doesn't play or tease but is open about sex. As a result she gets a bad reputation by all of the others at her school. I think most girls never make the first move because they don't want to come across as "easy" or "aggressive."|`|qlaZpHnPaa	they just expectus to for some reason..|`|31fDBuLjaa	Girls should always play hard-to-get.    If a guy likes a girl and finds out she likes him back, he'll like her less. So girls need to be sly, demure, crafty.
Ddfff5psaa	Yea that is exactly how it goes, unless she's mean haha I'd just tell you straight up if I wasn't physically attracted to you.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	If you were truly confident and charismatic then you wouldnt need to be asking this question here.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	I've called hot guys nice and I've called ugly guys nice too. It has nothing to do with your looks when they call you "nice". They may find you attractive, they may not.|`|PoTY8CNFaa	probably so.  Try wearing makeup.  Or go to clubs with a bag on your head
o1ibwPKPaa	Once a bastar* always a bastar*. He seems to be trying to make you jealous and is tricking her. He probably talks about you to her also. Have you ever even met the girl? He could be making her all up just to make you jealous and hurt you.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	bastar* (noun.)      definition--child birthed out of wedlock.|`|31fDBuLjaa	Yes, of course.   Even nonbastards can.|`|NrbLdZzOaa	Yes, its very possible.    Guys will treat girls that have self confidence and self esteem muchhhh better then they treat a girl who lacks in those departments.|`|zHwSyDNfaa	yesh|`|ia2kz4qyaa	no, he should treat you right|`|nsVbWXKraa	well actually yes.... they can treat one miserable and then treat another very well and be happy!!! usually no but it can happen.... AND WHY WOULD HE HAVE A REASON TO GET ENGAGED? We didn't get to hear his side of the story..... that type of thing doesn't just happen because of it only being one person's fault... it takes 2 to tango, 2 to fight, 2 in a marriage or divorce.... so     now he talks to the girl he is going to marry over 2 hrs aday and i wonder ; can someone treat a good person really badly abuse them emotionally and mentally; but respect and love another person....    as for the up above statement maybe he learned where he went wrong in ur marriage and will treat her with respect and such, key word is MIGHT....    ALSO USE ANOTHER NAME FOR HIM... definition of bastard is--child birthed out of wedlock.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Yes, a bastard can treat someone very nice, but eventually they will get back to there "senses" and become another bastard to her.|`|4Z8wogroaa	i'd say it's going to turn into the same thing as it was with you.  he's just a jerk like pretty much every other guy.
KzcDt8V9aa	Of course not!  Maybe you guys think that for us women, the thing that we want most in a man is for him to have sexual power, but you  are completely wrong!!!!  We love someone that LISTENS to us; we love someone that can be a FRIEND at all times; we love someone who would be with us NO MATTER WHAT and that would like to be with us more than with anyone in the world.      First of all, you need to accept the way you are, and show confidence.  The way you feel about yourself, is the way people is going to look at you.  Women love guys that are confident about themselves, because  we need someone to protect us, to stand for us, to take care of us, etc.  If a guy is an insecure person, how can we trust that he will take care of us???    So, start believing that you are a good date (as you've been told) without bragging about it (this we hate!!) and start being you.  (We also love authenticity, and we know when someone is being fake!) and try to make friends first.  Don't pretend anything, just be friends..listen, be caring, etc.  You will soon find someone that will love you very much...and good for you that you didn't have the crazy party life of your friends!!  That brings you a lot of confusion..believe me..    Hope this helps!  God bless you!|`|hq80t0NJaa	No. A lot of girls don't like aggressive guys~ it's nice to meet one that is easy going and easy to get along with... actually a lot of the girls I know feel really comfortable around guys like you... so there you go!    If the problem is you think you won't have girl friends, don't worry. Being a good date is a very very good start~ it will want to make girls hang out with you more, and make you more comfortable around them. Just get out there already stud; take some risks!  ;)|`|3YfovHtoaa	i dun subscribe to your thinking. i think each indvidual are unique on their own and need not change the way they are to be the same as others.
MnxzppYlaa	you're such a loser. go for it, loser.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Go for it before you end up in the friend zone.|`|ia2kz4qyaa	it's a sign and it's a good one|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Im pretty sure she likes you. I dont think its a accident.|`|6vZjtCeJaa	Ask her out bro|`|GCw0QZ7Saa	I think she likes you.  & i think you love her,lol. :)|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Punch yourself, very hard.    It is a mere coinsidence man.   BUT if you like her, tell her. Damn.  Nike it man, just do it.  Go for it, I mean WTF do you have to lose?  You're going to have to punch yourself harder when you get older and wonder what could have been!|`|4Z8wogroaa	what are you waiting for? start flirting casually and see how she reacts.|`|iWkFvKvLaa	This is almost EXACTLY what happened to me =D, I got close to a girl...quite like how you describe it, and we used to walk around the school together in the mornings mostly, and we often touched arms as we walked...She became my girlfriend after we continued to get closer and dropped brief hints that we liked each-other, and arm-touching was just one of those hints we admitted we did once we got together. VERY unlikely that its a coincidence man =D,, keep getting closer to her, drop hints that you like her (say you have nice eyes or something on msn/real life), and ask her out when the time is right.   Good Luck...seriously hope it works out|`|rqJPvUSRaa	The brief arm-to-arm rubbing could be a sign, or it could just be on accident. However, the way you describe your relationship/friendship with her--well, those actions tell me that she may be into you. Speaking as a girl and from my own experience, when I'm not really into a guy I tend to not waste any time with him at all. So the fact that she is continually doing her homework with you is a good sign that she at least enjoys your company.     Here's a way that you might be able to see if she likes you more than just a friend. Of course, it isn't exactly perfect. But again, this is from my own experience, as well as my girl friends', so it may be of use to you.    Ask her if she wants to grab lunch or dinner with you before your next assignment. If she says no--she may just be nervous (which you can only take as a good sign b/c people who are JUST friends have no reason to be nervous!)    If she says yes-great! now watch her during your meal...does she eat slowly and chew almost TOO politely? girls who like guys more than just a friend always seem to be shy when eating around their crushes. it might be bc they are afraid of looking like a pig/fat/not girly.
xrCbyfu5aa	tough call cuz you might already be stuck in the "friend zone" and thats bad. actually really a better situation then tellin her would be to hang out with her flirt it up then at the some point kiss her. cuz actions speak louder then words man. cuz alot of girls dont want ya to tell em the want you to show em. but you gotta have some game to do it. but if youd rather tell her then do it just dont go overboard, personally i never tell a girl i like them unless im ready to get in a relationship. just go for it whatever you decide it will be all good man and if it dont work out theres more out there k.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Wow you're "gameless". Anyways, it depends on what type of person you are and what type of person your friend is. Do you think that you are your friends type? If so go for it. Be extra nice to her and compliment her. Let her see it in your eyes that you want her. If she likes you, she'll come through...|`|m2jeeo4Laa	Very carefully.  If you truly think that you have a chance, and be honest with yourself about it, then just be up front.  Do not pour your heart out on one night.  When you're are friends with a crush, it's normal to want to tell them all the bottled up emotions, but you do not want to overload because it could push the person away.   Maybe ask I'd like to take you out, not casually, but a date.
4vv1ElyJaa	Masturbate... in front of him.|`|J6X14hWIaa	wowww how bad are you?  ive never had a guy turn down sex with me, or really turn down sex with anyone.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	Well if you try to get with him during your drive you'll come across as needy so when his is in, take it whole heartedly and open mindedly and really think about pleasing him even at the expense of yourself. i know it sounds bad but when you do it enough soon your drive will be in sync with his!|`|661f39420372e21b090f02f05da73dfaaa	Get a new boyfriend, or at least someone to play with.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	Masturbate.    If that's not enough, then you may need to consider ending the relationship. Sexual satisfaction isn't the most important thing in a relationship, but it is important, and if you're not getting it you have a right to move on.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	contact me so you don't have to wait for him to wake up and enjoy you  I will|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Wow, I was there. Get him turned on again. Try to get his sex drive ready to go. Look at porn together, talk dirty when you both are at work (using an instant messenger), buy lingerie, etc.|`|YyFexhd3aa	one word ..........>>>>>>>>>>cheating
SLiGpyoqaa	I don't think you should feel that any of this is your responsibility, and don't get paranoid and think that you'll break your relationship off now.    I think the difference between liking someone and loving someone is the fact that they're always in the back of your mind, subconsciously or not and that you still get a wave of emotions coming over you when you see them, not just from when you first touched each other or kissed each other. Perhaps there's no feelings in doing those things with you now.     Talk it out. Relationships can break apart without the strong foundation of a solid friendship and communication. There's a lot more to relationships than making out, you know!|`|ib00OjJXaa	in my opinion  like is she has feelings for you..its kind of like a crush  love is so much more than that, where your unable to explain the feeling    i dont think its a hint that she wants to break up  just do more things with her.    i think you click on your avitar  click on edit my info  it should bring you up to edit my profile  where the picture are  click edit my yahoo avitar|`|YyFexhd3aa	well like is based on physically attraction nothing more love is physically and emotionally i mean to Love the personality of the other person|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Love has no phases, like does.|`|h30HmxJHaa	No, it means that you probably haven't been going out for that long, she likes you but "love" is supposed to be this big, sweeping emotion (particularly to girls) that means you'll die for that person, want to spend the rest of your life with them, etc. That may not be the case, but it's what we've come to expect.     So likely she is going through the same feelings. I mean, do you know -- right now -- that you want to spend the rest of your life with her?|`|aXOyK3uBaa	LIKE -->> is a CHOICE.    You can CHOOSE to like someone.   Like you "pick" your friends.    LOVE -->> is an overwhelming desire to GIVE. Even when it doesn't come back to you. That's when love can HURT.. because you invest in something, your job, your car, your girlfriend, your puppy..... and one day it can be GONE - without a warning, against your own will.    It never "hurts" to "like".    But it can hurt to "love" because you will not always get out what you put in. That's doesn't matter though... because that's not what love is really about.    You don' LOVE something because of what you get OUT.  You love something because it makes you feel good to put IN.|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	Hard to say I think love is over used when your younger. To say that I like you Altot is good.     Go in your profile you'll see account settings click there and you can change what you want.|`|JVMiBNbHaa	No, some people think love is such a strong that word that you say it only when you think you're ready for serious commitment (like thinking about marriage and what not). Most likely she does really like who you are and cares about you, but needs more time until she believes there's a long future.
MqPUWdXhaa	You're coming on a little needy. Try using more 1st person pronouns. Decide whether or not to use punctuation or not, and use it correctly. Some people get away with little to no regard to proper grammar, so either own it or don't. Maybe you should also consider trimming it down a tad. It's a little lengthy, but he'll probably still read it all if he really likes you, I guess.

d3407bb7e70be0ec132046c62291b987aa	Actually, it is bad posture due to a curvature of the spine. It feels more comfortable because the leg you bend is a little longer than the leg you keep straight. The curvature of the spine tilts the hips downward on the bend leg, and tilts the hip upward on the straight leg. Seeing a Chiropractor and getting X-rays can help correct this "imbalance" in you body. It isn't anything serious, but over many years can lead to back problems and pain. That is why older people you know complain about back pain. It is from the spine curving the wrong way, which misaligned the vertebrae, which pinches the nerves running between the vertebra causing pain and loss of strength and vitality in the limbs and organs connected by those pinched nerves.|`|Ddfff5psaa	I always do that, I try to fix myself but especially at the endof the day I'm just too tired to stand straight...
xvZoOTLiaa	friends first
klSZoy87aa	Don't do it.    You need to consider what will happen if you get caught. You'll both go to jail. Is it worth doing something that you're already thinking against?    :|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	ewwwwwwwwww|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I would like to see that video|`|c2YcBbXyaa	you're a crazy fool for even considering it! forget about it! it's wrong on so many levels i can't even think of where to start..what the hell is wrong with you???????????|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Oh my goodness. Please dont have sex with your aunt, its incest and not only that but you will regret it right after you do it. Your whole family will be ruined and believe me they WILL find out. Theres something wrong with her to be throwing herself at her own nephew, why cant she find a man her own age and not her family member? Just think, would you want your son or daughter having sex with one of your brothers or sisters? Its disgusting.|`|KncPJwIaaa	My man you best leave that be cause shes your aunt by marriage i hope cause you didn't say that and she going to make you a happy boy and how old are you anyways and post a pic of her so i can give the yes or no cause man you got a lot on your plate messing with her|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	Listen I am a mom and a aunt to some handsome young fellows and I love them to much to ever think sexual about them would not cross my mind and Look you are so much better than that She is flipped if she even thinks you guys would not be caught and if you were then you are in serious danger and She will blame it all on you ..   You are not hard up to be with your Aunt and I question what kind of woman she is to even think something like this .Maybe she is nasty or has something is why she is not happy with her husband ,Never take pictures with anyone like that ,Please be the smart one here and tell her you are not interested and put her in her place this is so wrong of her to do .Tell your mom if she don't take no for a answer.,|`|MMf19oI9aa	Your aunt is being inappropriate.

7xRvxd6iaa	the more she messages him, the more it will put him off...  by constantly messaging him, she's just coming across as clingy and annoying.  tell her to back off and wait for him to message her, and not to send so many messages back!|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I think she sounds a little desperate.   She could have said all those things in the one text and it wouldn't have seemed as bad.
dWeHChwwaa	ok , this man has officially creeped me out, lol, no offense.  i think they only wat to get rid of him is to be straight up with him and tell him you dont want anything to do with him anymore. Tell him youve moved on, and your seeing sombody else (even if it is a lie, because i think that might be the only way for you to get rid of him).
iwXs65h2aa	It's very easy to lie to others to let them know everything is alright for the time being. As for you, nothing is going to be okay until you except what has happened and stand up for yourself and siblings. It's not something that happens overnight, you have to stand up and show yourself and everyone else who you are and what you're capable of. Confidence boost, wake up tomorrow morning and tell yourself you can(because you can), it'll be a lot easier.|`|J7QO7zj1aa	Because it is what we do to keep fighting. Do you think that he thought everything would be ok every time he said it?     You tell them that not because you know for a fact, but because you want it to be and because you will do everything in your power to make it all right, the more you tell them that the more you will believe it yourself. Cause trust me, everything will be ok.|`|j6pqXCh9aa	because you are not finished grieving over the lost of your brother. Losing a loved one is very hard. and it seems that everything is out of sorts. but everything will come together for you when the grieving process is a little less painful.  And you may not believe me when I say that yes you can be a brother like him because you watched everything that he did and its imprinted in your heart you just have to let it come forth.  Everything is going to be okay, they need you and you need them, when things get difficult just ask yourself what would he do in a situation like this.  God is watching over you and your family and when you need him just ask for strength to do the things that you need to do for yourself and your siblings and he will be there.I know a lot of this may not make sense right now but it will. But grieve first and continue to live day by day, your brother would want that.
5Slqssqoaa	Your choice is do you keep your friend or do you pursue her ex? It is highly doubtful that you will be able to have both of them.    Not any easy choice. If it was me, I'd drop the guy. There are plenty of men, but to have a truly good lifelong friend is something that should be cherished.     I also think it is a bit sleazy of him to make moves on his ex's best friend. He may be doing it for revenge or to get her back (in spite of what he says).|`|fg2xU6Z2aa	well i have been in the same situation, so here it goes.   i think you should sit her down and tell her the truth, and ask her how she feels about it! you know see what she has to say! tell her how you really feel about this guy and how he makes you feel, if she does not like the fact you are into her ex she ain't a real friend, because obviously she don't love him or she would have broke it off right?    really its all up to you sweetie, im mean there are alot of guys but very few good friends, but at the same time there are also very few good guys! you never know he might be the one and might not! personaly i would do what your heart tells you! not what any one els does|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	basically it doesn't matter, she is no longer your best friend and you know it.    women don't have friends, only enemies that they pretend are friends.|`|T6WplPeBaa	They're not together anymore, if she is truly your best friend she should be happy for you. IF she wasn't she's not you're friend, don't hold yourself back be with him it might be something great!    coleisman... don't know what kind of women you know...............
FyqCMrCdaa	Its too much bro. Girls don't work that way(generally). You need to build a relationship with them not throw one at them. It's just too much at once she'll start thinking too much of it. You should definitely get her number though and txt/myspace/facebook as a means of communication. Then once a relationship has developed you can talk with here more openly about your feelings. :)|`|KKPsTOXgaa	yes its creepy. dont write that, just say keep in touch or something.    this would make her say YES thank god i left work (from the awkwardness/creepiness)    so dont do this.
vjB9ARWmaa	lol thats a good point. it could happen cos u never really no who else uses this unless theyve like told u or something.|`|5zjwOSe9aa	probably not... possible, but the chances are like the whole time zone in north america has to be the same, mix it with the UK, and Australia, and compete it with like 300 other questions per minute.    I was thinking the same thing too|`|Sfxzrjaoaa	Yes. Or people write about a really serious thing from both points of view. Devil's advocate stuff. That can appear schizophrenic.
s6e4bqahaa	Hey i was wondering if maybe the two of you would mind if i came along with you both this year,so you could show me around? It really sounds exciting and would like to join in if it would be alright?  I would kinda text it like that..If they say yes,you just might become a part of thier "adventure in the coming years?Good luck and have a great time either way!|`|c5anDswjaa	Umm I would say just talk to them about what its like, and that you have never been.. Maybe theyll say you should go with them!|`|KtCE991Vaa	who cares go anyway!!!|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	"Hey, I'm going to that carnival too!  Think I can bum a ride from you?"|`|vjB9ARWmaa	first. cudnt u go with someone else? if not then do u REALLY need to go with someone? or go at all? if so then yes do ask them. i do think they will say yes but may slightly ignore u. dont take it to heart, they just dont like u :) lol jkz nah just like ask and theyll prolly say yes and then let them take control of it or they might think ur intruding :)|`|jgXTrdS6aa	we men wants some time alone sometimes.. i mean not alone... being with friends and such. you have to understand that. if you cannot stand it, then you dont trust him.|`|5cb36c236a72565c7bd48049f6092b5eaa	if you really don't want to ask. talk to them about it and try to trick them into asking you to come along.    seem interested and whatsuch and mention that ur going or something and maybe mention that next year u three should go together in a different way... well of course or not.    find other friends you could go with maybe too!! not them of course... good luck!|`|R1oUYnbKaa	just ask if they are going, and then ask do you want to go with me, then they will invite you if they want you there :)|`|UXNXntARaa	If they talk about it again mention to them how much fun it sounds, they may just ask you to go with them.  If they don't ask you, casually ask if you can go along.  Just say "hey, would you two mind if I go along with you to carnival night?"  If they say no then maybe they're not as good of friends as you think they are.
UBm9hKWuaa	sorry  thats kinda like her saying    BUZZ OFF or GO AWAY    no offence, thats just what that last text means|`|J6X14hWIaa	your kind of a creep for knowing exactly how many minutes the date was.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I personally dont like being bombarded with texts, so maybe you shouldnt have sent her so many.  Anyway you should write one more and just say hi what are you doing this weekend would you like to go out.  If she says no again then she aint interested.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	settle down.....she's probably busy....i'm sure you'll get to see her again soon
oUiVckg2aa	of course you can help yourself. dont tell me you just pee or **** whenever you feel like it cause you cant control the urge to do so. yes, you are certifiably a flirt. but you can do something about it. good thing if the girls you are flirting with feel the same way as you, just want to flirt. but what if their emotions get involved. having your heart broken is no easy thing. it could even get nasty. so it is entirely up to you. either you do something about it or go continue flirting heavily until you fall in love and find out the girl is simply taking you for a ride or worse, a girl whose feelings you hurt cuts off your cucumber or gets her brothers to play with your kneecap.|`|YyFexhd3aa	You are freaking kidding me get a ******* life casanova im even questioning if there is any girl going out whith you|`|JH6oCuUZaa	I am sure you will figure something out.....but this is not worth effort to answer.|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	Haha, I hate Myspace because of that reason. It's hard to juggle multiple girls, and almost always it ends up in a bad way. I don't know what to tell you. Maybe cancel your Myspace and try to keep this going for as long as you can.   Good Luck Brother.|`|AGmZNf7zaa	stop being a f*** wit and break up with two of them.|`|SB0aZTf7aa	Pick the one you like    and you seem to be a WHORE BAG.    but you don't try to, which sort of not your fault.|`|zadtCE1paa	stop taking the bus|`|UBm9hKWuaa	FK dude  u 1 luck soab  well, if theyre not that bad looking    so i suggest    dump 1 of the myspace one's   and then just make sure the other 2 just done see eachother a lot
NqMmvvgVaa	Tell him to stop moping and enjoy life. It's almost like he loves you but at the same time by saying that he is kind of insulting you.
PCcbECdZaa	we give a gift to someone, they return a thankyou in love  we slap someone, they know they did something bad and hurt  we abuse someone, they are emotionally damaged  we invite someone over to dinner, you gain a high respect of theirs    You may not say I love you, but they will return something of the same value (or) opposite (i.e. I don't love you).     So even though the many things you described, there may not be an equal physical reaction, or opposite, there is an equal emotional reaction either negative or positive.     Good idea though :)     Plus, if the reaction was always opposite. . .that would suck! :(|`|7uVjp0QKaa	This law is about action and reaction , and may be in love if there is not enough action then opposite reaction will not take place . You need more power in action .|`|AA10246871	Newton's Third Law has always been one of my favorites, but he was talking about the physical laws of mechanics, not about the laws of emotion and the heart.    The heart and soul operate with different laws, and they aren't as easy to describe. They are the product of the personality of the persons involved, and as such, are not subject to the laws of motion.    What you describe are good manners, not laws of the universe. So you're right--Newton's Third Law has no application in the case of love.|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	There are many contributing factor that calls for the reason.Its mainly because its love its a feeling that's needs response of similar. Love is not something that can be seen but need to be felt and its not easy as when you are in that position you usually go nuts which is slightly lower level from the normal. This allows a lots of dreaming but not that practical unless ENFORCED.Again its not a material of an matter so most probably you will never get that response unless you are some well to do guy or highly capable in a social grounds.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	very true very deep. much thought.  Love cannot be defined rationally, only as a strong feeling. but no one knows what kind of feeling deeply. Each love is different on a different level. Two couples may be in love and with the same intensity and levels, but because of many different...what's the word.... variables that had happened to them during their relationship. it is a feeling and every being has their own mind in which we have our own ideals. it is irrational, crazy, beautiful, perfect, stressful, and everything in between. the is nothing set to love, no rules, like when you get a gift you must give one as custom. Love has no custom. It must be learned by each individual on a different path and there is no set path.|`|hq80t0NJaa	You forgot about the first two:  1.  Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. If they love someone else, they will continue to love them unless some external force is applied   2. Fnet = ma. The force applied has to include the masses of the two people and they both have to be accelerating in the same direction (acceleration is, of course, a vector quantity, so the direction matters).    The thing Newton forgot about was chemistry. In the first law, the object could spontaneously combust because of intermolecular forces. In the second one, the chemistry inside of a person is constantly changing, changing their mass (even if it is only by small amounts). In the third one, love is all about the chemistry.  How's that for deep?  ;)  Check this out, it's kind of funny for this situation:  http://xkcd.com/55/|`|jp5lfmzTaa	When you push your finger into butter, it gets immersed. what bloody Newton's law.    Its the same. Apply the action on the right place.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Why would you condone abuse? That's ignorant!
cKSbZBt8aa	I think its because its remarkable when a women reaches that point, what ever you think, it is beautiful.|`|xvZoOTLiaa	damn girl it just is!!! every gut LOVES it|`|0f3wWfC8aa	its actually really hot....go for it and enjoy yourself :]
xvZoOTLiaa	let her breathe|`|8X8q379kaa	Honestly, things have already changed and the best advice is to give her some space. Stepping in between another persons relationship is the worst thing that you can ever do, it causes way too much drama. If you she was mutually interested in you before then maybe she is just trying to get more of your attention. Show her that you can do the same and start acting more confidently around other girls in front of her. She might get jealous and come crawling back to you.
5cb36c236a72565c7bd48049f6092b5eaa	and the end of the grad thing ask her honestly and straightforward.    i hope of course it doesn't ruin anything between you two because you are taking big risks. you guys are great friends and she might just believe ur asking her as just a friend. you never know.    if you ask her how she feels about you and she says she likes you as a brother, you just ruined it. ooh. this is risky.    try to find out from other friends if she likes you for reals!    good luck!
cj8iM1Olaa	Not me...But that's because i'm not married.    No, but seriously, not all guys are like that. Just some, who didn't get enough love when they were a child...or military people. Relationships involving people from the service usually are about as worthless as dog crap.|`|eqWftUQeaa	Sadly, I think so... but alot of women are like that too. Nobody has any morals anymore, or self worth, or a f cking heart for that matter|`|2pxGPcxaaa	that guy is elf sh!t|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Not all men are the same, and that applies to the women as well.  Each to his own though.  I would say this person is not much of a man to be trusted.|`|tDUs971eaa	I was married 25 years and never once cheated.|`|BBlfetz3aa	def not true. i'm married and i would never cheat on my wife. plain and simple. don't let one a -hole mess up your thoughts of all us other guys|`|0f3wWfC8aa	no not at all..i would never do that...its just rly messed up|`|8XZOosMBaa	not really.. it just depend on relationship who are not very serious about relationship.. like.. marriage but after that flirt other girl are not really serious at all.. if you marriage then still do things together.. not doing like cheat or whatever.. is serious :) i am guy and i will never do like that!|`|4wlwyhvnaa	I'm not like that so my guess would be that all men aren't like that. I think some men are like that and they just don't do what they do to one person. For example, this guy has several women. One man has ruined maybe 10 womens perception of men. Not all men are like that but the ones that are tend to have a greater affect on women.|`|C9th0daNaa	no he is a jerk to be nice ok all men are not like that|`|Pg3voqXkaa	Not all men are like that.  This guy sounds like a complete jerk and he probably associates himself with the same types of guys which probably made him make that remark that all other guys are like that.    There are some good fish out there in the sea!  They're just hard to find, cuz u gotta sort thru all the gunk to find them|`|8ZARrsnXaa	no that guy is an Idiot and the fact that he's married I say he's one big D-Bag. good for you girl cause this guy is not a real man anywho i mean hes married, when your married no more woman. thats f" up dude feel sorry for the wife.|`|QM2cQ9Ogaa	nope.    that man only tells you this to see if he can hook you to his list.     Don't be taken in by him|`|VXW1XeFsaa	I just thought I would point out that for every man having an affair with a woman-there is a woman having an affair with a man.  The behavior goes both ways.|`|QkIfyLdgaa	No that guy is an idiot. If you are married then that means that's the only person you will love forever until you die. I'm not married but I'd make damn sure before I devote my life to someone forever|`|A02muWfFaa	you're hella dumb. you obviously don't have a dad. all you have is some loser you consider your imbassedor to the world of men. go to church. stay away from older guys. they talk to you cause you're dumb/|`|ICjBorriaa	It really depends on the man. It depends on how he was brought up and also how is treated by women. It also depends on if the man is interested in other women. Some men can be just interested in their work and their wife. I think it depends on if the man is married to a woman whom he thinks is very beautiful and valuable and if the woman likes the man alot. But it could be that around 70-80% of men may cheat in someway. But I think also women cheat in someways too.
31fDBuLjaa	Pretend you're in your own little world and are completely indifferent to him and to what people think of you.    Think supreme self-control. No one will see you sweat.    This too shall pass.|`|AA10246871	My first therapist gave me a really great piece of advice once: when dealing with other people, ALWAYS be the bigger person.     That came from a conversation about a friend of mine who was acting rude and cruel because I had a nasty break-up after dating a guy for four years, and then, six months later, met a really great guy. She started being difficult, for lack of a better word, when I first met him, and she got even worse when he asked me to marry him. (He's been my husband for a very loooong time now.)    My therapist said that it never, ever does anyone any good to be petty about things, and that it's just easier to be the bigger, more generous person. He also told me (it's weird, I can, as I type, picture his office, and the chairs we were sitting in, and what we were wearing) that if you make a habit of being the bigger, kinder, more generous and adult person, people will eventually notice that and respect you for it. But it isn't really about gaining the respect of others--it's about being able to look at yourself in the mirror and know that you aren't acting like a toddler who is pitching a fit and trying to hold her breath until she turns blue in the face.    So yes, talk to him. If he can't keep up, and wants to be petty, don't rise to his bait. Keep your cool, and be an adult, and people will notice, but better yet, you'll feel better.    Take care.|`|rH4eUC9Baa	Give him a bj and you should be set for the rest of the semester.     U KNO U WAAANT~IT!|`|ib10oHUZaa	but will talking 2 him mean he includes u each class?  prob not..  i know its hard but cant u make friends with someone else.     its not about being the bigger person but u guys need space atm.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	try to make friends with the half of the class that arent his friends lol. but if that doesnt float ur boat then u cud either talk to some of his friends (he cant hang with half at once can he???) or talk to him.|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	you should not talk to him no matter what. even if you are alone. it's ok. you need to have some self respect and pride.|`|MzbxcAnWaa	i say f_*ck him. hes a loser.|`|ide4Hi5gaa	Go for it baby.  Baby, you cant hold a grudge  You gotta get cha some babygirl.|`|P6sR82B8aa	i dont know|`|5zjwOSe9aa	Yes definitely.    You see, its not so much everyone is just "awkward around you" but his friends probably don't want to be the first to stir up things, which i hope won't happen.    So i'm sure if you just go up to them and talk normally, even to your ex, they'll all be cool with you again, even if his friends are more friends with him, they'll still say hi.    As a guy , i just really couldn't talk to you when i'm around him, because it'll be like i'm hitting on you.    But if you just came and talked to me, then that'll be fine.    I'm sure some of those guys miss you too.    answer mine please    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Un2RCU4Waa	u dont have to talk to him. keep you ego and let him mind his business.

Your going to get hurt if you keep up as you are with him.|`|jTV6rLX3aa	You should just tell him that because he and his girlfriend are starting to become more serious, you want to be platonic now.

This guy is not a good friend to you. He uses you. You are worth more than that. If he was to dump his current g/f and go to you, would you be able to trust him?    My advice is to delete him. You will miss him. You will be tempted to contact him. But you will have to be strong.     Take some time for yourself. Eventually you will meet a man. One who wants to be only with you. Who will treat you well. He will respect you. You will look back at your old "friend" and wonder why the hell did you waste your time with him?     Keep reminding yourself that you are worth more than your so called "friend" seems to think.     I wish you the best.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	You have to ask yourself what it is you want?  I suspect you hold onto the relationship because it is an easy way to meet your physical needs while not being involved emotionally with someone.  While FWB is helpful in some cases - especially in vulnerable times like post divorce or being widowed, or simply being too busy to date like graduate school when your body has needs but your mind can't handle dating someone.      On the other hand I do think it is a moral dilemma to be involved with a married man.  I think women do have an obligation to not encourage another woman's an to sleep with you.  I might see it differently if you were both married and cheating but as it is he is risking a lot and you are spending time with him rather than finding a life partner.     No one can tell you what to do but i suspect you are sensing it is time to move on.  Change is always scary and we tend to stay where we are - even when the situation is negative - but change often brings great reward as well.  May you find what you are seeking.
xvZoOTLiaa	semms so
SupWrLRIaa	I'll throw my voice against the din just because I have too much time on my hands. Age doesn't matter. I knew a girl who was 17 dating a 26-yr-old (close enough) and honestly I felt like she had to talk down to him because he was so much less mature than she was. There wasn't anything wrong with him, he was a fairly 'normal' 26-yr-old, she was just extremely mature for her age. It is just a number; the only thing it affects is your perceptions.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	He should be in jail.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	Yes, he's probably creepy-though she won't realize this for a few years.|`|BAGxriLBaa	He's way to old for her...|`|Pg3voqXkaa	Eeeh, that's quite a big age difference and I don't see what they could have anything in common because ...life experiences are different.

I subscribe to this one because frankly... these are the only real rules that exist.      2) The  18 rule. This is a cultural rule but it conflicts with the age of consent rule above usually. "dont have sex before 18". I dont know who invented this rule or where it came from but..... its been debunked by the age of consent rule. It just doesnt know it yet. I think most people subscribe to this one. I have nothing against this one but.... its just not a real rule. It doesnt override the real age of consent laws.     3) The age gap bias and bigotry rule. This rule basically states "if a young guy likes an older woman he's a boy toy and if an older woman likes a younger guys she's a cougar. If a young woman likes an older guy, she's a sick gold digger with father issues and if an older guy likes a young woman, he's a pervy creepy lechy guy using people for sex."     White females do not age good enough for me to cooperate with this rule. Some males are dumb enough to play along with this one...but my IQ is 135+.  Rule number 3  is just a bully system invented by older women. Not a real valid rule.       So each person should choose which rule they want to subscribe to. I choose to subscribe to rule number 1... and if she is over the age of consent in her state.. then its fine.    He's not a bad guy. He is like me. A young cougar with a dong, except my chick is 20.
SupWrLRIaa	They have no right whatsoever to tell you who can and can't sleep in your bed unless you had some sort of agreement between the four of you in the beginning. That said you shouldn't be spending time sleeping with him in the living room. Confine yourselves to your bed and explain to them that you like him and you enjoy spending time with him and they will just have to understand.|`|n53HeORBaa	be pleased that your roommates have told you up front that they do not like what you are doing rather than gossiping behind your back, respect their decision since it is also their place and not yours alone, try inviting your BF when they are not around and if he goes there when they are around go somewhere else to spend the night and let them understand that you are an responsible adult and would be careful with whatever you are doing|`|Bm9x9ydxaa	Bring him over when yoru roommate is not there.|`|J3iBuHAHaa	Tell them that it's your decision and that they need to trsut your judgement on your guy choice. Or if they really are bugging you about it, get a hotel for a night. Its luxurious, quiet, and you'll be all alone. Everyone is happy in the end :)|`|SO7zRZK9aa	Tell them to chill the F out. You've known him for 12 freakin years! If he didn't do anything to you anything since then, he probably doesn't plan on it. Rapists and serial killers aren't that patient. Perhaps you could ask him to wear less cologne if that would help, but other than that, they need to grow up.    UPDATE:  Your parents don't want you dating unless your getting ready to get married? Obviously they have some OLD ideas that they need to get rid of. Explain to them how that does not make ANY sense. The whole point of dating is to find that person whom you want to marry. What you're saying they believe is, sorry but, COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!|`|KncPJwIaaa	Well it ain't no secret now and your friends are jealous of you believe that and you respect them by sleeping in the living room **** you should tell her hit the couch lol but hey long as you like they better love do you|`|2JJLYSAKaa	If I was your roommate, I'd be annnoyed with you too.  If this was just your place, you can do all the "secret" stuff you want.  This whole secret relationship thing is BS.  What is he married?  Why do you have to be secret?      You are selfish and inconsiderate to your roommates.  They have every right to feel the way they do.  It has nothing to do with them not having boyfriends or whatever, so don't go there.  If you want to hide your secret relationship, go get a hotel room.  Have him pay.  You can do whatever you want and don't have to worry about his smelly cologne.  I wouldn't be surprised if these 3 ask you to move out soon.  I would since you have no consideration for anyone except yourself.  So what if he is not in your room, the living room is worse.   In my home, I like to feel comfortable.  I want to be able to walk around in my pajamas, walk around with a face-mask, pig out at midnight, eat ice cream for breakfast, etc.  How can I feel comfortable doing any of this with your secret bf sleeping over in my living room?  I don't want to hide out in my room if he's there.  I shouldn't have too.    Shame on you.|`|nsVbWXKraa	stay at his house or have him stay somewhere else... he shouldn't stay in the apartment unless it is only urs.... then do whatever u want|`|lgZIcE52aa	Tell them to get over it, you pay rent too!  So therefore its your house and you can bring your company over anytime you want.  As long as he is not mean or stealing, he isnt their problem.  Your almost 21, too old to be dealing with stuff like this!|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	They don't have the right to tell you what to do, however, you should respect their opinion because it's their place as much as it is yours. If they don't want him to spend the night, then you have to figure something out. You don't want this to turn into a huge deal.|`|PCcbECdZaa	Tell them to man up!!!! :p (literally)|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Punch 'Em.  Problem solved.      Tell them that you do what you want, and that they need to stop being such negative nancys and grow up.  At least you guys arn't making poon tang while they are there.  And if you are then it's a different story and I would have to side with the roomates.|`|AzdAvDW1aa	U should come out with it u no tell every one so u can stay at his place. or u can tell yr roomate 2 get over herself|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Talk with your roommates about it and see what it is they don't like so much about him. Maybe they're just not comfortable around him yet because they don't know him and what he is like. Why don't you watch movies, play board or trivia games, or some other group activity with all your roommates plus him. Make it not just about you and him all the time... let them have a chance to get to know him better. They might start to grow more comfortable with the idea.    Don't spend too much time at your place. Go out to dinners and if he comes over, don't let him stay over every night he visits. Let your roommates know that you're willing to make a sacrifice for them, since they are making one for you.    When he leaves you could spray something in the air to make the smell of his cologne go away, or open the window for a bit to let it go out the window, so it doesn't bug your room-roommate. I dunno if it will make it better or worse with the spray, or make the room cold with the window, but it's worth a shot.    I hope this helps you out. And I wish you luck!|`|5cb36c236a72565c7bd48049f6092b5eaa	see his opinion and tell him what they think of him. maybe he could tone down on things they don't like about him and whatsuch    maybe you should all go to dinner together to get to know each other. let them get use to him so that they'll know how great of a guy he is!    they're just uncomfortable with him around. i mean he's a guy...|`|0ef4b766bd32e9ac6d5202e8c84e53d9aa	truthfully, i kind of have to side with your room mates on this one. your actions are making them feel uncomfortable in their own home, and that's just not really a fair thing for them, and could make things hard for you as well.     i think that unless you can work out some agreement with your room mates, then you and your boy will need to find somewhere else to go to sleep over - maybe his room? this isn't about how old you or your room mates are. it's about the fact that this is a shared space between the two of you, and they are not comfortable in it at the moment. and i think you need to respect that.|`|hngTcCnKaa	dear, you are currently sharing a place with other people so whenever a friend /bf of yours needs to sleep over, you really need to seek consent from them, and if they don't agree with it,even if you just stay in the living room, still it is not appropriate to force the idea..i fully understand how you feel, ive been in that situation,however, we really can't force other people to understand all of our wants/needs. If you can't accept their decision, it would be wise to find a small place that you could rent all by yourself so that there wouldn't  be any problems with privacy, visitors etc,  but you know what? if your bf has friendly charms, your roommates could eventually allow him into your area freely! that is if he would gain the trust of your rommates|`|5rrtJaEHaa	I can see your perspective as well as your roommates'. On the one hand you want to spend time with him. On the other hand, you should respect your roommates. I used to bring home my ex boy and it annoyed my roommates. I should have been more discrete. After all, it may not bother you, but your roommates can't really get away from it.     I have a roommate who brings her boyfriend home every night. He talks loud and I can hear his manly voice through my bedroom walls. They giggle all the time and it's really annoying. I try to keep my relationships discrete. When your female roommates are single, they usually feel intruded upon when there is a male in the household. It's creepy to hear your roommate having sex or giggling all the time with a guy. In my situation, the problem is really bad b/c the guy comes over and they talk all night...I can hear it. It's rude of them and if she is so serious, she should get an apartment with him or get her own apartment.
Pg3voqXkaa	Relationships are hard work, but if both of you love each other, then you'll be willing to put that effort which will pay off in the end!|`|hcc8fq7jaa	I've never heard of that policy. Could it just be that the dorm mom is overprotective, and overstepping her authority? Besides, he's a senior, so he's what, about 21 or 22?  Doesn't seem like he should need anyone's permission to leave. It would be funny if he called mom and dad in order to get permission, though. I can just imagine THAT call.
3MOiWrZraa	Being a girlfriend is harder, being an army wife is even harder. That being said, if you love him and he loves you then your relationship can work. Trust is something that you both must have since he is going to be gone for months at a time. There may be times when he's home for a year without leaving for super long periods of time. At your age, it may be whats best for both of you. Remain great friends and explore your adult life for a year or two and if you really feel like he is the one then pursue the relationship. I just dont think its fair to you to essentially put your life on "hold" for him while he is away unless you've had a chance to be a single adult. Good luck!|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Yeah he is doing the right thing. You're young and he probably wants you to experience life, after all he is going to be gone for 5 years. I'd say to remain friends.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	wait until he comes back if he's not dead or move on. relationships in the military WILL NOT LAST LONG. i was away 2 years before i came back. unless you're married.that's a different story|`|J3iBuHAHaa	no matter what title you guys have, that doesn't change the feelings that you guys have for eachother. so if he likes you, and you like him..then take on the responsability of being an army girlfriend. i mean sure, it gets lonely, and stressful thinking about the one you're into far away and fighting. however, if you feel you can hadle it, then go for it :)|`|1Df04dWaaa	he is doing it or both of u. he feels its the best, wich is understandable since u guys havent been together for that long like years or anything, and feels its better if u guys remain friends and maybe in the future it could be more. cuz it happened to my best friend and it happened just like you. and after 3 years in army he wanted to be with her after he got out. and they started a family and had kids and are happy.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	Yeah, relationships in the military, espcially at the onset, are always hard. From everything i've seen, just because you're with somebody, doesn't mean a thing. They still go way out of there way to find something on the side. It's probably best this way|`|M7r7gHNGaa	A lot of men get their first glimpse of their mortality when then join the military. Because of that many will end relationships because in the backs of their minds they are aware of the possibility of being sent to war and they may be killed or maimed there.    Being an army girlfriend isn't as harsh as being an army wife but it really is harsh. Communications may become spotty and there is no guarantee he will be stationed anywhere near where you live.    Anyone who joins the military changes greatly and in a relatively short period of time. Much of this is due to the greater responsibilities they take on and the discipline they learn during the military training. Of course there is always that spectre of mortality.    Ask if you can continue to communicate as friends but if you really like him, please don't be pushy about it. He's got a lot on his mind now.
kfNBVZH6aa	Tell her  ......
UezXqDF6aa	look I know that for every woman there will be no exact time line that anyone could follow to the t. I am one of those lucky few who can say that they have never had one normal time in my life. But let me tell you this. It will all be ok I am not a normal person. I started younger than most girls and I have yet to have one time match up the the last time or any one before it. I did go to the dorctor andn was told thhat it was ok to not have a normal one. What it is, the body flushing out the insides and letting you know that you are not pregeant. It is also letting go of all the extra waste in your body that is not flushed out threw the piss and ****. when a girl is not regular it all depends on the enviornment around you and wether or not you have had a lot of sex and if you are healthy. Now if you just stop having them all together then you might want to go to the doctor and see what theuy say. It could be something bad or somehting that they can treat or maybe it is good news all the way around.
UBm9hKWuaa	HA!  thats like not obvious at all that she totally likes you    dam, hate that u cant use sarcasm, but she totally likes you  shes just shy    so heres what u do  first  start a conversation   say something like  hey, whats up?  or (only works on mondays)  whatd u do this weekend?    then she'll say something  then u try to build up off of it like  ex. oh, i went to the movies and saw unborn    u say  oh, really? heard that movie was really dumb    then keep talkin  and like in the middle of the conv say something like oh, i like your hair, it looks nice today    then few more sentences, then say that you have to go and ask her for her phone number before u leave  remeber  confidence is all u need  dont have second thoughts, just think to urself ( what would i lose?)|`|cGazG1Tuaa	You'd never know.    People may like to go "hi-and-bye" or ask simple questions like "hey tomorrow must bring what?" may be someone who is interested in you but just too shy to strike up a casual conversation.    Maybe she is slightly interested in you cause you say that she stares at you during lessons. :)
gdOFLIjbaa	well good for you(:    just be careful maytteee. Maybe he just wants to be friends. in that case you don't really want you heart to be broken & to shatter your friendship. Your young and there is plenty of time for this sorta drama later(: Normally flirting with guys comes natural. Just wait and see what happens. or if you really think that he likes you ask him out! don't wait forever.  good luck.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	You are too young to date. If you are too nervous and immature to go up to someone and talk to them, what makes you think you can date?|`|LBkYjFkDaa	girl ask him out just do it, ur good there's nothing holding you back

wZgrGMK5aa	Aunties has more experience ,more sexy . they have good butts and big boobs.therefore boys attracks towards aunties.all aunties know how to start sex activities.|`|Dem2qFdnaa	The answer is quite simple. Many of them are attractive.  You are naturally shy with people of your peer group. (High school was  difficult for you. You were always awkward around the girls). But it  has always been another matter with older women because they are not  you don't consider them as peers and you interact differently with  them, you feel more at ease and confident|`|aG0OqGoPaa	i dont know about it
6jN3g0x8aa	Yes I was, for 2.5 years.  At first, I thought that I long as I was honest with him, and didn't do anything that would be disrespectful to him or the relationship, then things would be fine.    Unfortunately, things never improved.  He didn't trust me anywhere, anytime, or with anyone.      If the person is not trusting you, without solid ground for believing you are not trustworthy, you should question whether this relationship is for you, or not.    It's very stressful and upsetting dealing with someone who doesn't trust you.  No one deserves to walk on eggshells all the time in their relationship.|`|shvhgzXeaa	Yeah my ex was convinced that I had an affair with the local bar maid. At first it was accusing then she became controlling and so obsessive about it. In the end I left because I didn't want to be in a relationship with no trust. When she found out that the bar maid was in fact a lesbian (which I tried telling my ex but of course she accused me of lying) my ex then wanted to get back with me, which I declined.|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Yeah I have unfortunately. Thing is, he has no reason not to trust me, it's just past experience that has affected his general trust in girls. I hope one day he can overcome it so then he can stop accusing me of silly things and hurting me in the process. I love him so much and I'm  always afraid that this is going to drive us apart, but I will pursue for as long as I can in showing him that I would never break his heart.|`|mGvSEY6Saa	yesss :$  explain yourself and tell them they have no reason not to trustt you..  or tell them you dont trust them|`|wE2etBzbaa	Yes, in relationship with myself once in awhile, I don't trust myself, I think sometimes I'm too creepy for myself.   and pervert , while I sleep, myself touches me, so creepy.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	Yes and it was horrible. I knew i hadn't and wasn't doing anything wrong so i concluded his mistrust of me was an indication that he was doing things he was afraid i would do too..Got rid of him,that was my only option................|`|rKHUhaAAaa	I have never, but if it happens to me. I'll make him to believe me and trust me.Maybe he doesn't trust you cause you're still his new GF. So, make him believe you. Never cheat on him and never do a lie.|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	Yes,  I have been in a relationship where I didn't trust her.    How did I overcome it?    I didn't.|`|rqSVDNbbaa	I don't trust me Knowing trust should be gained or earned ........but I Trust her since i dont expect ........ But she would never trust or belive MY words..... we are in terms & conditions not in relationship yet......|`|AA12340254	No, I haven't. Without trust you have nothing worth having.|`|EmpDdyHraa	I was in a relationship like that for 9 months  and was miserable. I was faithful, but the guy was insecure. He kept accusing me of wanting other guys and at times would start arguments with me and hang up on me. I would in return not answer his calls for a few days and then cuss him out whenever I did. It was toxic so I cut ties with him and couldn't be happier. If there is no trust you have nothing to have a healthy relationship.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Yeah I went out with a guy, that whilst he didnt ever admit he didnt trust me - his actions proved otherwise. Like if I went out with my friends he'd constantly be texting me or ringing me - wondering if there were any guys chatting me up - and insisting on picking me up afterwards to ensure I went home alone - that kind of thing. This lack of trust was totally unfounded also, and whilst I put up with it for a few months, it eventually got too much and I had to finish it  xx|`|ounWvY70aa	I tried to be nice about it at first but after I while I couldn't stand it anymore and broke up with them.    example -     If I was out with my friends I was getting constant calls asking where I was, then when I got home he would basically interview me about where I had been and who with etc. It was ridiculous.|`|g5ShGjszaa	It didn't work.  My ex expected me to not have a life outside of her, so she never trusted me with anything.  And I'm not even a guy that goes out and parties.|`|bH1DYr5saa	Yes. I'm not with him anymore!! There was absolutly no reason for him not to trust me - it really boiled down to him being very insecure which in turn made him clingy, moody and arguamentative. Trust is such a major part of a relationship, so it soon gets very tiring to keep defending yourself against unfounded accusations.   I don't know for sure, but it does make me wonder if his reasons for not trusting me had more to do with him maybe doing things he shouldn't have been...|`|h9y1IZA2aa	yep, i married him even though he didnt trust me at all, there was no reason for him not to trust me he was just too insecure himself i think, i ended up divorcing him as it got too much, with in a year of marriage he got even worse and i couldn't leave the house without accusations, it got so bad he even suggested i was trying to kill him by putting poison in his meals so i could run off with another man.... how psycho is that!,   i was never allowed to leave the house to see my parents, never mind getting the chance to meet another man.  i am now married again to someone who trusts me completly, been married for 2 years now and yes he is still alive lol|`|PyRxe9B2aa	The people who don't trust are the people who can't be trusted. You will find this to be true most of the time.  They will tell you that their ex was a cheater WELL is it true? He is not trusting you so it probably isn't Some abusers use this to keep track of everything you do and every place you go. Get rid or him now. You deserve better, at least someone who trusts you.|`|j1FCM0pqaa	ye n he'll push u away address this situation to him its not nice to be with someone that thinks u can be untrusted , its like a slap in the face .    he'll prob only realise when he has lost u ,  if a partner has been untrustworthy and they were forgivin well they have to move on and forgive otherwise its never gonna work out n it will ways be brought up .    i could never be with someone if they didnt trust me it would just make me uncomfortable all the time around the person ur supposed to love|`|XGZBEdAWaa	You have to have trust in a relationship or it's doomed to fail, but trust is something that has to be earned on both sides. Allot of times when someone doesn't trust his bf/gf it's really about their own insecurity not anything that you've done and you really have to reinforce that they're the only person that you want to be with.  If after 4 years he doesn't trust you then he probably never will, sorry to hear that.

Nco7uM0gaa	Your x friend is not mad at you,she is very insecure and mad at the world.She needs counseling.All you can do is to keep the friendship casual or just avoid her.You do not need this problem.If she asks you why you avoid her,tell her the reason.Trust me.it will happen again and again.
bZWbwyn4aa	From my experience, my son is closer to me and my daughter is a daddy's girl (she's apparently going to marry him when she grows up, LOL).    I can't say it is fact, but I do see it a lot.  I think the relationship changes as kids become older.  I used to be really close to my dad, but now, as an adult, am probably closer to my mum (although I get along with my dad well too).|`|RfA0eMlpaa	nay it is not true i am a girl but i am very close to my mother it is not that i dont like my father i just love him
k4WWFv6gaa	A power of attorney can be revoked by the concerned parties any time. Your question and the wordings imply that your father is no more. And it is usual and normal for a mother in this circumstances to rely on her son. You need to convince your brother about your view patiently and after all he is your brother and don't say there is no love between you and your brother. And he will listen.

I have been where you have and trust me my husband picked me because I was moving on and taking the kids with me and he could have stayed  home but he chose us thank god  I hope he picks you because it wont work out otherwise and thank god I havent done this to my son and made his life hell|`|AA12346188	There is no other go.  either you have to adjust or drag your husband to have a separate house away from your In-laws.  No via media in life.  You can only divorce your husband and go away, if you are financially independent.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	If the mother in law insist you come everyday for dinner. Fine, let your husband go for dinner. You stay home. If you husband loves you, he will miss you. Hopfully he will want to stay home with you. Do not give in, going to the mother in law for dinner. You need to stand your ground on this.     You married a mommys boy. The mother in law needs to cut that apron string. 1 thing you can do is, live further away...to where driving to their place everyday for dinner is out of the question.    You mention, you and your husband talked about once a week. That sounds good. Now you both just have to stick with it. If your husband can not, then you stay home. Have you and your husband talked to the mother in law about this problem? If not, you two seriously need to talk to her.     I understand she loves her son. However she needs to know that you love him too and that you two need to have your own life....that doesn't involve her every night.|`|Z1d6OqGRaa	this is general problem in indian culture, parents do,t want to be practical about the fact of life of daughter in law.  pls b sincere and seasoned to discuss healthy with your hubby and in laws about the issue and get some confidence.  You pls also make some comfortable urself and hubby to sit with parents at comfortable time of eachother.|`|d30f07a15879f4c7bb74b100b34135afaa	It is entirely up to your husband to set his mother straight.  You must talk to your husband.  He must be firm with his mother, and tell her he is married now, and live up to his wedding vows..to put you FIRST.      If he is too weak to do this, you don't have much choice but to approach her yourself and let her know you and your husband now have a life of your own to live together, and not with her in between.    Set boundaries.  Tell her you will have dinner with her once a week, and that is all, except for special occasions.  You and your husband must be firm.    Good Luck.|`|RBtAIJEOaa	well dear I can understand what u might be going through, I would suggest don't leave ur husband alone with ur MIL(this would worse the situation). U can plan for some nice evenings for him so that u get some time together go out somewhere I know every evening u cant go out for dinner but just go out on drive or small house hold shopping.. probably this can help u improve the distance in ur relation.     best of luck u need to be real smart to deal with ur MIL|`|3DAbOau2aa	I think you are misunderstanding your mil. I feel she is just lonely and insecure and you could sympathise and feel sorry for her. If you love your hubby then you have to respect his love for his mother. Its not advisable to send your hubby alone to visit her. If you'll cannot visit her on weekdays, maybe your hubby can spend sometime talking to her over the phone to make her happy. Or why don't you suggest that she visits you some days or on weekends instead of you going there everyday. That way she will realise how inconvenient it is for working couples. Its better not to antagonise her - you may need her help when you decide to start a family.

At least you have a boyfriend, Im nowhere near getting one. Erm all you can do from here is do as you do, later in about a week make a joke about it and make it obvious that you know they know. That makes things a little bearable. Its fine, so you were 'enjoying' it whatever so what.    And to be honest at least it wasnt some random guy, I know a girl like that.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Stop stressing over this!! They're prob only jealous anyway!!! I wouldnt worry about it in the least! It shows that you had a damn good time and that you woke this morning very satisfied!  xx
dxlNwGuWaa	From experience, yes this is wrong.  I saw a married guy for over a year.  I actively sought a married man after strings of bad relationships-i just wanted the fun but no commitment but eventually I fell for him. He kept telling me he wanted to leave his wife and be with me but he never did.  She also had suspiscions, but never found out for sure. He didnt have kids though.  So I broke up with him.  I was gutted and he kept trying to contact me, and in the end, i deleted his numbers and told him to never contact me again.  Later that year i met my fiance, who I love dearly, and we are expecting our first child in September.  This man you are seeing not only has a wife but also has kids.  Think about them.  He wont leave his wife for you. Trust me, its not worth it in the long run.  Find a single man.  You end up just feeling second best otherwise.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Get the hell away from him, don't go 'cutting someone else's lunch'.  He won't leave his wife for you & you could wreck everyone's lives that are involved, wife, kids, his & yours.    He just wants his cake & eat it too.   There are plenty of single guys available.  You'll just end up as a notch on his belt when he gets tired of you.  How can you stand the thought of him going home to his wife & kids etc?    Don't lower yourself to his standards.   You never know he might be spreading the word he is grooming you & then once he's used you start calling you names.    Run fast & far away.   Take care.|`|OE8r1VtRaa	Dont lower yourself to being someones bit on the saide, he'll prob never leave his wife for you and its just a bit of fun.. have some self respect and respect for his family.. do you want to be the centre of ripping a family apart? kids losing their daddy?  Think about it, you deserve better.|`|FzFSzilmaa	just enjoy the sex... BUT make sure it isn't in his house...    do it at your place or a hotel... ;)|`|C0yagFFoaa	dont be silly, this guy has no respect for you, all he wants is easy sex, you'll feel cheap everytime you do it, and then you'll convince yourself you dont mind, but you will , dont do it, there ar emillions of single men out there.|`|WUZwxdICaa	Well what you should do is remember that this man has a wife and kids at home. Unless he is going to leave his kids and wife tomorrow morning, you will just be someone he has sex with on the side.    as long as you are cool with that than he will definitly be cool with it. it will get messy when you start to seriously fall in love and want him to make a decision.    be very careful though, i seen these situations get ugly, for both parties involved.|`|AA11553531	y do u ask others if u already know ur answer...."don't do this gal"  and its so wrong!
pOCabUMvaa	Try the Psychologists Association of Alberta.    Do a web search and type in Psychologists in Alberta, Canada, and a whole slew of psychologists will come up!!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I have no idea. But I hope you find  her?? Some of these psycologist are REAL WHACK JOBS??? Thats why their in this profession???
pOCabUMvaa	I have been married for 16 years going on 17 years this month, and it is not easy when you are first married and either one of you looses a job.    Just be there for him, support him, do not try and push him into finding a job, he knows what to do, he just has to have time to pull himself up by his bootstraps, and do this on his own, when he wants a job suggestion, he will come to you.    Just be patient, he feels bad enough that he lost a job and that he really has a lot on his plate right now, to be the wonderful, supporting husband that he was before he lost this job.    Keep re-assuring him that he still is wonderful, and supportive, and keep reminding him of why you married him in the first place, give him positive strokes, he needs to be reminded of that this time.    Do not talk negative, talk positive, and maybe offer some job suggestions for him, only when you think he is ready for your suggestions.    He will let you know when he needs your help.    Just by being there, that is enough for him now.    As one wise person here on Y.A. once told me, communicate, communicate, communicate! Is the key!!!!|`|sxImRCT5aa	umm help him find a new job and say dw itll be fine trust me you are going to have a great job|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Make him understand that something will come along eventually. In the mean time, if you are providing financially, make sure he understands that there is no rush and that he should take his time and calm down about it. At some point int he future maybe it will be the other way around,w ith him supporting financially while you look for a job, so let him know you dont mind.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Yes...if you have spare time, sit down with or without him, and circle some job ads that you think may pertain to him.  Other than that... just be there for him when he wants to talk, and always encourage him.  Best of luck to you both... I'm sure he'll find a job soonest !!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	This is a very hard time for most families today. I went through it myself. The best advice I can give you is to make sure he doesn't start to get down on himself. Men in general have a harder time then this I think because they were raised to believe that THEY provide for the family. So he might be feeling like he's worthless because he's not be a good provider?? So just keep his spirits up and reassure him that you know he's doing the very best he can. And that this is not his fault. It's the bad economy right now. Make sure also you don't start to fight about things that don't matter. Couples can get caught up in this situation and start to fight more often. And whats really behind it is the tension everyone is feeling because of the job loss. SO make sure you guys don't take this situation as a personal thing. It's NOT. It's no ones fault. Just stand by each other and support each other.GOOD LUCK!! I hope things turn around soon for you two.|`|ZQiwgdRaaa	If you really want to help him out, back off a bit, give him space to be a man. If you have a job, then just do what you normally do and make sure he is not getting depressed.|`|FzFSzilmaa	tell him there are always alternatives to get things sorted and help by staying active physically and mentally...|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Personally, I'd hate to be mothered constantly (oh, everything will be alright. Oh, you will find another job.  Oh, I have faith in you) and I'd be annoyed if my wife was trying to "help" me find work as it screams she has no faith in me.    Give him room to work through this thing on his own, don't harp about it or bring it up (unless he does) and simply continue as normal.  Men might enjoy protecting an solving problems for our wives but we don't like other people doing it for us (as it says we aren't capable).|`|UXuSI6EZaa	no matter what happens, don't lose hope. don't keep asking him either. he needs you to be there for him while he's going through a rough patch. he'll bounce back faster|`|nX1QW5GCaa	I've been "down-sized" twice in the last 5 years.  It's really a tough thing to go through for the male ego.  All you can do is be supportive and display confidence that something will come up for him as long as he perseveres and looks at finding a job as a full time job.  The older you are the harder it gets.  Last time I was in my early 50's and looking for a management position.  It took me 8 months to land something.  I've got a younger friend that took almost a year to land a lower level supervisory position.  It's tough out there and not easy to stay positive after a few hundred rejections.  Tell him to look for local services to help with resumes, interview skills, job search techniques etc.  There is usually something out there that can help.  I had 4 different resumes going - for different types of jobs I was applying for.  One stretched things a bit when applying for higher level jobs, one was "dumbed down" a bit to apply for lower level positions.  The others stressed different skill sets to try and appeal to various industries.    Offer to help with search, but don't start circling ads in local papers.  He'll just take that as you feeling he isn't capable or isn't looking for himself.  Actually, I found newspapers to be one of the worst places to look.  Virtually all the same positions come out first on Workopolis or Job Shark or one of the other web job search engines. I also got calls in response to me resume posted on these sites.  Recruiters use these sites too to find candidates.   Also, tell him to build a list of companies where he might want to work and check the careers section on their web sites daily.  You never know when something will pop up.    Good luck!|`|yy45iAbtaa	just be there for him.and make sure you don't start nagging about the little things.he will find a job give him hope.

AA11591803	I love my wife. I actually worship her. I spoil her when the chance is available. She does the same for me and I am not just talking bedroom stories.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	I think what may be more common (and I mean like 10 billion percent more common) is people who initially love each other, and by the end of the engagement or first few years of marriage, become disillusioned and give up.  They can convince themselves that they love him (her) and they'd be perfect if they'd just change a few things.  Unfortunately things don't change, and in fact, selfishness and apathy grow over the years.  Most couple put up an effort for the kids, because they think growing up in a cold, emotionless make-believe family is better than putting the kids through divorce.  But maybe that's just me.|`|3nQfMZj4aa	don't go down a road if you dont want to reach that destination.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	Yes...................I'm one that has stayed married for the kids.

BUT, spent 25 years in first marriage - just putting in time and waiting for the kids to grow up.  Was it the right thing to do?  Who knows.  We didn't fight or provide a tension filled place for the kids to grow up.  It was an emotionless relationship for the most part.  I know others that have split when kids were young.  Good and bad about doing it both ways.  It's up to each couple to figure out what's best for any kids involved.  They're well being should be the over riding factor in any decisions made.  After all, they're not the ones that caused this - we did as parents by hooking up with the wrong person.  Our mistakes shouldn't hurt our kids any more than it has to.|`|AA11328507	I would never stay with someone that I was not in love with or stay with them just because of the kids, BUT my best friend is with her hubby for that reason and its just wrong and makes no sense to me.

Yh63ysrzaa	Yes, I think that is normal.  But you have to remember that who you are matters to you and to the people that are important to you.

kV7WKjtaaa	Ask yourself one question, what will he gain if he lied to me? and is he gonna get anywhere by telling me something that he doesn't see?

Don't worry about your weight or the scar on your face. You have to trust your guy because he is the key to you getting your confidence back. What your seeing is a low perception of yourself because you are feeling low. But your guy sees you for what you really are, which I am sure is beautiful.|`|Yh63ysrzaa	You need to believe in yourself.  You need to see yourself as beautiful.  It doesn't matter what he says or thinks, it matters what you see.    Learn to love yourself.  I know, that's easier said than done.  But start with making of list of all the things you do love about yourself.  I.e. your personality, your ability to make people laugh, etc.  Then look into the mirror and tell yourself you are beautiful!

Be honest---you won't believe it because you are so down on yourself.  I'm sure you are a very beautiful person and that others feel the same way, but in the first sentence of your question description, you immediately list reasons he shouldn't think you are beautiful by describing your body.  Please see a counsellor (not because you are crazy), but so you can become crazy about yourself and get some good tools.  You need to love yourself for what you are, heavy or not.  Please get some counselling with the goal of loving yourself and letting go of that fear and insecurity.  This is your only life--choose to live it happily and with self confidence.  Choose to give yourself the gift of counselling.

Just state calmly what happened, and what happens, and ask them to take steps.    You did not state how old you are, or how old your sister is - but if you are 18, you could consider moving out to a place of your own.    An alternative would be to see if you could live with a relative for a while, or talk with a counselor, teacher, coach or a doctor, someone who you trust, to get some support and ideas on how to deal with it.|`|Kub6woPhaa	so did mine i understand but im trying to over it|`|wOsJ1QEYaa	ugh my brother does the same exact thing and i'm getting sick of it.... not matter what i get in trouble even when i'm just telling him to stop something..... and he'll like freak out if i say something about his friends or tv shows or anyhting he'll like freak out on me......  i think about going to live with my grandparents to just get away for alittle bit. so maybe that would be good for you too.... go stay with family or friends for a weekend or something like that|`|lb6s0Yvhaa	Trust me on this opinion.

But on New Year's Eve she phoned me asking to be friends again, and I said okay, and I will - but I am not holding my breath on this. There's been no apology, not even an explanation, for her behaviour, and I have no intention of letting her under my skin anymore.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	You shouldn't hate your sister.

WaZc4TGfaa	hmm.    1. Just say it straigth to her face. Stop copying us. Sometime ppl need to have their own opinions. For instance she finds the shirt u wearing very ugly but yet she still wants to wear it because she feels left out. Too avoid all this copy cat confusion. You and friend 1 should just be u know difference. But the main reason she does all this copycat thing cos she feels like she's the only one who doesn't have the same interest with you and friend 1.    2.She is jealous. Just keep it fair.If u like friend 1 more then friend 2. then maybe ur friendship shouln't be a trio.     3.Tell her to just stop telling bad stuff about other ppl. It is as if she's good enough or had the courage to stand up for herself and tell her friend that she doesn't like her or something. And i think she's a little obsesive to care what other ppl think cos she know ppl will  talk bad abt her when she makes the wrong choices. For example she ask ur opinion about a dress perhaps? Doesn't mean u said its nice,other ppl will like it too. You like what like. U can't force urself to like the stuff that ppl think its cool when u urself find it very uncool.MAIN POINT:BE YOURSELF.|`|LeRjrY3Haa	Smack that ***** up|`|8d71245589a5c5738df7b583c1ece4c0aa	She definitely feels left out,wants your attention and love ,so try to be patient and let her be,it will hit her someday.|`|ocIsJXHGaa	she feels left out and is trying to fit in.
4iIr0ANnaa	I think your mind is swimming in this whole business. Just take a step back, and breath. Look at what's happening from a neutral point of view.     Is friend 2 copying you to be mean, or to be in the group? If she's being mean because you and friend 1 were hanging together too much and friend 2 was left out and probably jeaulous and she turned a bit bitter and she's annoying you and now she's copying you and oh no -       Wait. Just take a step back. Get some fresh air. Go blank. Don't try to 'figure it out' like it's a big puzzle, because it isn't.     To answer your questions:  1. About the copying thing... Do you get all worked up when she copies you?  Do you tell her to stop, please? Do you try to make yourselves harder to copy? If you do, don't. IGNORE it, that's the best way to go. If you haven't already, ask her "Hey, I've noticed you've taken on a few of our traits, haha. why is that?" If she's nice about it, accept her answer and move on. If not, just do the ignore thing. The most frustrating thing is to have someone ignore you. HOWEVER, don't get too carried away with the ignoring business. If she's a good person, only ignore when she copies you. If she repeats a phrase you said, don't react, but don't flat out shun her and leave her alone.     2. Of course she's probably jealous, you and friend 1 are thick as theives and she's been left out. Of course she's gonna be a bit spiteful. Now, you probably should not accuse her of being jealous when you speak to her. That'll just make her deny it and make things worse.     3. As I said, comebacks are bad. Ignore it.      Overall, if you want to stop being friends with her, just start drifting away from her, don't tear her off you. Be nice to her when possible, but not overly friendly. When she says "How's your day?" say "good, thankyou." don't say something like "oh, it's been okay, remember that guy you used to like? he came over to us and..." because that'll just confuse her. Why are you being nice to her, but avoiding her at the same time? Ignore her when she's mean to you, but other than that don't make a big deal over what she does. Let her be.|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	like you said before, just ignore her. however she is not jealous of you and friend 1. Also, people arent mean to people for no apparent reason. if you had a special friendship between you and 1, it would have been wise to let friend 2 know, rather than insulting her. to be honest, she only wanted to be friends with friend 1 but didnt realise the extent of your friendship with 1. friends are friends, bf are bf. the two should NEVER be mistaken for the other. it is easier to say to someone, look we dont want you to be our friend rather than making them believe that you do. because out of common sense .... HOW is she supposed to know????? to be honest , it would be mature enough to let some one know rather making them believe the opposite of what you want them to know. But in future be more honest about it. dont waste your time telling us the whole story. Take no offense but to be honest, i dont think she wants to be friends with them at all considering the type of people they are!!!
SxejtImxaa	Stay away from the fuzzy looking one, it may make them suspicious that youre hiding something|`|A8ySMvOHaa	the coloured one :D|`|tiopdRMWaa	definitely the clearer picture.
4T9fZzITaa	yes snob her off  you can tell her either  simply she's not your type  you just want to be friends you don't want anything more than that  your not interested & you don't like what she does, makes you uncomfortable. or tell her all of the above.. wouldn't that be harassing anyway?|`|C0yagFFoaa	i find the best way to get rid of women is to go out with them, take her outm, take her to bed, then dont call her, she will lose interest.  and you get a shag out of it|`|FzFSzilmaa	ignore her... :D|`|t3G5xSbIaa	just tell her that she sain't her type, you don't really like her nothin gotta be ugly then a gf! lol|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	some chicks just dont gt it or mayb u jus got a psycho on ur case.  u wil just have to b very very stern n direct with her tell her plain and simple I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED IN YOU, U R NOT MY TYPE!  u could send her to the moon, if she saw u with another chick or smooching another chick.|`|g5ShGjszaa	Is her name Bubba?|`|A0IvDqsGaa	Have you tried telling her that you just want to be friends. If not then try that. Or maybe try getting her opinion on other girls. Maybe she will get the hint that you are into someone else. If all else fails, then just stop talking to her. Some girls just don't get the hint and you have to be point blank with them. If her touching you makes you incomfortable, then tell her to stop. That is called sexual harassment.|`|Z97CVElxaa	Tell her that you feel unconformable with all the touching and that the 2 of you are friends and nothing more (do it nicely because you don't no how strong her feelings are)|`|sxImRCT5aa	i dunno say its over we can be friends and plz dont touch me i dont feel comfortabe tell er da truth|`|Yh63ysrzaa	Have you tried to tell her that you don't like her in that way?  Be honest with her.  Let her know you don't have any feelings for her.    If that doesn't work - AVOID her!!!|`|a984cQjKaa	go find your spine first, and then tell her that her being all touchy-feely makes you uncomfortable and to please stop.  if you allow her to act this way, it tells her that you like it and she will continue.|`|iTuarIFHaa	Be nice with her, don't be rude. Tell her, your a beautiful girl but your not my type. Please stop touching me. I hope we can be friends and all. Hope this helped!|`|2AhcNaBzaa	make it obvious like if she puts her hands on you take a step back or pick up her hand and move it if hints don't work stop being so friendly to her
Yh63ysrzaa	You say you've spoken to him about it, but have you told him that if he doesn't "play fair" there will be no more playing?    Honestly, it sounds to me like he is very selfish and only cares about giving himself pleasure, not about giving you pleasure.    If he can't come around to your way of thinking, maybe you need to re-evaluate your relationship and see if this is really what you want for your life.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Well, as he likes to try anything new, tell him it would be new for you to c   u  m  first so he should wear a c o k ring to help in that matter.|`|a984cQjKaa	tell him he doesn't come until you do-then make it happen.|`|SxejtImxaa	Tell him to go whack it a half hour before you have sex and maybe he can have sex longer the first time .  Guess you're just too hot looking .|`|AA12340254	Very selfish and obviously does not care about you! Find you a nice guy that is more caring. This one only cares about his needs. You don't need that, do you? Aren't you worth more than that? Don't you deserve someone that will consider your needs as well? Of course you do. Kick him to the curb, he's just using you for a blow up doll.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Yes he is being selfish. Sex needs to be mutually pleasing for both people - he knows that you're not getting any pleasure from this and the fact hes not doing his best to change things shows hes very self centered.  Talk to him - tell him that its come to the point where its not acceptable anymore, and that either he goes about changing the way ye have sex - or you'll just change him!  xx|`|0e6f9ff4e6c2ab5d705df6ede492d5f0aa	Yeah that's pretty selfish, if you're like me you strike while the irons hot so to speak, don't want all that hanging around - just get on with it!  He has to change his ways and consider your feeling otherwise there is no real future for you together, not between the sheets anyhow!|`|TQ2s5Bolaa	just let him masturbate you    it would help for u to come, lol      dont buy vibrators because ur bf would be useless unless u love ur boyfriend,  so thats all|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	Yes, to answer your question:  he's selfish, and one of these fine days after he has been satisfied and is laying over you in a coma, think about how he's not caring about you and how this behavior might be an omen of what he's like as a person.  Do you always want to be on the bottom of your relationship?|`|e4b5cc70f9565c51ee5cd0eeda900c24aa	yeah, totally selfish.  i suggest just not doing it with him for awhile.  see what happens when he's been deprived.|`|3325a2162fb81b6dcd62281b3f7a6677aa	If he's as open-minded as you say then ask him for cunnilingus (oral), walk him through it and let him know that you want to get as much pleasure as he does the first time. Don't masturbate, that will waste away at hormones stored in their little compartments around your body :). More than likely he'll be into it, if not, then hold sex back from him until he learns how to please you. He'll get the hint.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Try to extend the time you two spend on foreplay until he ejaculates.  No sex but only foreplay until he ejaculates, then a little rest and when he gets it up again, its your turn|`|7cc06876966176629f3e97057e261e53aa	he is selfish. Have a talk with him and if he still do not respect you, break it up.|`|NXT4sTqIaa	i don't think so. he is having a lot of intrest on you, generally men cannot able to do more that certain time, the timing also differ from men to men.    it's better you can have a talk with him and understand the root cause for that.
4h3fbtzHaa	Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 2 1/2 years now when we first met we had sex at least once a day if not twice (that was way to much) but now we live together and are like a old married couple and we maybe have sex 1 or 2 times a week. I would like it about every other day.|`|dzNnf3LHaa	Most men have a high sex drive the first couple months you are in the sack.  It starts to slow down a little after that.  Then, after a year or two you will be in tune with each other and you will have sex on equal terms, at least until you have kids.  The truth is, too much sex is not a good thing, esp. for women, we get really sore down there, so do men.|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	Honest, right?  I know I'll take hits for this but I think men have higher sex drives than women, and I know some women do but not as frequently as men.   I think we are built differently.  If women were honest, we get annoyed if we are pecked at all the time.  We like sex and affection, but do not like to feel like continuous "receptacles" for our men's unrestrained urges. I think you can talk about it with him because men and women do not always march to the beat of the same drummer.  If you always give in, after a while you will not be doing it honestly anyway---so try to negotiate with him.  What's the worst that will happen?  If he doesn't have sex 90 times a day he'll leave you?  Well, gosh---let him go.  He can choose to reign in his impulses with you so don't fall for the high sex drive gimmick.  Hate to sound old fashion, but if he truly cares for you, he will want to communicate with you in all ways and do what is satisfying for both of you, including controlling himself.  But...if you like it, then enjoy it.|`|uYtV3WrPaa	yes, actually. he can't control himself.. HAHA. but i'd prefer if he had it less.|`|7541af920534320050bed438788e7151aa	Yeah having high sex drive is healthy lovewise.    No proble at all.    Just imagine when your boyfriend is having low or no sex drive at all.This can make you sick.|`|8CK14CAYaa	My husband's isn't quite as high as mine, and I have to say that can be frustrating. My ex had a RIDICULOUSLY high sex drive, but as he was amazing in bed I loved it!   I dunno, I guess the grass is always greener, but as long as you feel like you can both be satisfied without the other getting totally sick of it you'll be okay. Stuff like that comes in cycles you know. He'll cool out after a while, or you'll heat up, etc. It happens in any relationship that lasts long enough to see the full cycle. Just roll with it, give a courtesy bj every now and then if you're not feeling like it but ya know it is killing him, lol! Good luck!|`|kIblsxJQaa	Its a pain.  He's constantly on about it.  It gets me down.  Danger is if I dont give it to him, he'll find it elsewhere as most men do|`|aMZ7IKysaa	I'd prefer that my husband had a sex drive period.|`|GHjBCI8taa	mine doesn't    lucky b!tch lol.
sagb3Q7Vaa	He is probably being truthful. My cell  phone will not accept calls or text from overseas  although I can send . Kinda frustrating.|`|DTPERfnBaa	Your too young. He probably seas it like that. Probably thinks it wont work.|`|OTxm8cChaa	You need to do your best to control your emotions; the more free time you have, the more you will torture yourself by letting thoughts pop into your head, about what he's doing or how sincere his feelings are for you.    You also need to find an appropriate way to explain to him how you feel.  Do not accuse him or interrogate him, but let him know how you feel and try and find a solution that works for the two of you.  Recognize that he needs to be able to enjoy his time with his friends, but that you would appreciate it if he made time during his day to go online and talk with you.    Another thing is that you are still a very young woman!  I thought I was going to marry my internet girlfriend back when I was 18 years old.  I met someone soon after, and thought I would marry her too.  I have been heartbroken a couple of times, however I have come to realize that you always eventually meet someone else, even if it takes a little while.  I don't mean to discourage you at all, but my point is that long distance relationships requires mutual effort from both individuals; if you find eventually that you are drifting apart, or that you're the only one putting in effort, don't be too hard on yourself if it does not work out.  It is part of life, and the experience will make you stronger.  It did for me, even though I didn't realize it at the time.    In any case, good communication is important, and so is choosing your words carefully, to express to him how you feel.  He most likely does care about you and love you; whenever you start focusing on the negative, try and force yourself to at least think of all the positive things, of what it is that he does to show you he cares about you.  Good luck!
b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	OMG! She was really quick about jumping in after you broke up with your girlfriend!!!! Be honest with her, tell her you love her like a sister, but thats all it will ever be. You may lose the friendship over it, but it might be better that way if shes always going to live in hope that one day you'll be together, and you knowing that it will never happen.|`|k8IrNyGkaa	Yeah, agreed. Tell her gently how you feel, she'll be hurt? (in any way that will happen unless you feel the same way, which you don't) But she'll understand.    Goodluck.|`|sNE4orNgaa	be honest but be gentle- she could have mistaken a close bond as attraction and you dont want to lose her as a friend- take the time to explain to her properly
UEI4PEUhaa	well, gurl! i'm 14 and i'm a real tom-boy. i know how it is. i move a lot cuz my parents are missionaries so i don't have the greatest social life. but if i were you then i wouldn't let his popularity get in the way of your relationship if you like each other. just hang with him and when the time is right tell how you feel. you don't have to be like, "OMG!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU AND!!!! uh!!! CRAP!!! let's get maarrrrrriiiiieeeeddd!!!!" just tell him that you like him and ask him if he feels the same way. if he doesn't then no prob. just continue being good buddies! maybe he'll change his mind in the future. but don't let your crush ruin your friendship with him. good luck sweetie!!! :)|`|HSjaI8SFaa	Geez, you sound like me when I was your age! I belonged to the "social middle class" and I pined over this guy who was a popular jock. We were never friends before I started liking him, though. But, just ask yourself: Has this guy ever given you any signs that he likes you back? If the feelings aren't mutual, or the same, between you 2, you can't make him like you. I used to try so hard to do things that I thought would make certain guys like me, but it never worked. Hair, makeup, clothes, etc.( never anything skanky or sexual, though).  The bottom line is, just be YOURSELF. If the guy likes you for who you are, fine. But don't go changing yourself to what you think he likes, that's always a mistake. You end up losing yourself that way. Don't get pressured into "sexual" situations either, even if the guy says he'll like you for it.     Final Thought: Stay single as long as you can! Relationships make life a bit more complicated. You're too young to worry about pleasing a boyfriend. Just do what makes you happy and stick w/ that. I didn't have a BF til I was 19, and I survived just fine. Enjoy your life and have fun!|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Tsk...  did  you  say  you're  a  "late  bloomer"???  And  you're  only  13  yrs.  old?!!  Gasp...  shrug.  Where  in  the  world  do  you  get  your  philosophy ???    My  advice  is  to  be  courteous  and  polite  to  him  whenever  your  paths  cross.  Other  than  that,  continue  to  be  the  way  you  were  before  you  found   out  you  were  a  late bloomer.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Talk to him if you guys been friends.Tell him how you feel. I know its hard. ^  ^|`|3325a2162fb81b6dcd62281b3f7a6677aa	Live your life and go with your feelings. You have to experience life in order to learn.    Go after him and let him know that you like him. He may end up being a jerk and next week you'll have a different crush. Just enjoy your life and don't get to attached while your young, you'll want it back when your older.|`|7cc06876966176629f3e97057e261e53aa	Since he is popular, you should seize your chance but do not make it like as if you are so despo or something cause it might make him avoid you. Talk to him more often, ask him out. If you really like him, you should have being the initiative one, make him catch your attention. OR ask your close group of friend for help,
T4t8rdTNaa	my kids are the exact same ages in that order too...mine do the same..which one starts the bickering? my son always starts it but he has so much anger inside that that's the only way he knows how to release it -- he's been getting counselling through many different programs and i'm hoping that things will change, but of course these things take time...be as patient as you can be, and pick your battles carefully. If there's alot of hitting involved separate them and give them each something to do to keep them entertained for a while - it's a decent break for you even if it's a short lived break from hearing it constantly. If toys and items are being thrown around as well then start taking those items away from them and make them earn them back by showing their best behaviour - of course if you don't do this already - then to start base it on small amounts of good behaviour - like 2 outta 5 times a day of good behaviour for a week to earn the item back, then eventually make it 3 outta 5...and keep working your numbers up higher to be basing it on getting a full 10 outta 10 of good behaviour each day. Also make them earn rewards such as a boardgame night, movie night, a long walk (just examples, not sure what your kids are interested in), having a chart for them to see is also a great idea. My son loves seeing the days he's had good behaviour, it makes him work harder towards earning his toys/video games back, and board game or movie night.|`|0ece3ea96233735c56393ae48382a64caa	Sell them to the circus.|`|UJ6D0Wm5aa	You need to start by figuring out why they are so angry inside.

They could not look away. They had to look at eachother.    I let them stand there for 30 minutes. If they acted up the   time was extended.    I told them that they would learn to love eachother one way  or another, but they were not going to treat eachother that  way in front of me.    Best wishes|`|FzFSzilmaa	try distracting them with other things... they sound bored!!!|`|nd4QSsr1aa	this is absolutely normal- just keep reminding them that they are brother and sister-  that the fighting may seem fun now but as they get older, they will learn to depend on each other- and become better friends that they will ever imagine-|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Kids act like this when they are bored, when they have nothing else to do.

i1JVe24Oaa	You should definitely talk to you buddy first, ask whether he really has feelings for you or not.   But, more importantly, you should talk to your boyfriend about the situation. Honesty is the key to everything - what if he finds the text and thinks you two are hiding something? Who do you trust more?     Approach this with sincerity, tell your buddy that you are very close with your boyfriend and don't have any feelings for him, apart from friendly ones. If you are really good friends, you should be able to talk about that.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Give up texting for Lent.|`|LQ54i1J4aa	Just call him ugly and tell him you have a bf.........................................

If u really can't take it, say brb, bf call! and seem reli reli excited and happy. Like hey brb! It's chit chat time with (nickname of bf in a cute way).

f9ca0489c84566012f6ae440195cf6b4aa	take a deep breath and talk to your fiance - I think traditionally the brides family pays for a lot of the wedding/celebration expenses, but given that your family doesn't live in India and the large celebration is most important to his family then perhaps they are planning to cover most of the costs - you should be clear about that.  Especially since, given that they seem so well connected, the guest list could quite easily exceed 300.  (my friend just got married in September - they ended up with well over 400...and she thought it was going to be small)    does he have a sister you can talk to...or a female cousin?    it would help greatly if they could talk you through what happens  there are also a couple of websites that do a good job of explaining the different steps....do a google search for Sikh wedding    definitely have at least your mom go with you - otherwise you may end up feeling lost     finally - your dream wedding doesn't have to compete - it will be the one YOU remember forever - and it will be nice later to be able to tell your children how you honored your own dreams and your husbands tradition    congratulations and good luck|`|7RU7p7traa	dont bother - nobody in India expects you to know much.    the flight cost for u and your small family is not that much, for an important event as a wedding. Either you dont think its a priority, OR - if you really cannot afford that then you must categorise every other priority based on the financial position     you can do what you imagine in a wedding in Australia and since there will be 2 weddings you can discuss the costs in advance with yoir husband and make your budget. Unless you want a lavish australian white christian wedding and expect your husband to pay half and then say that - oh i cant contribute for a lavish indian brown sikh wedding    so what if your alone with strangers in india - just follow simple rules and smile at everyone - and then come back to whetre you belong - Australia
ebD1plKNaa	I've never gone through anything like this, but I do know that grief is a strange and ongoing thing.  My mother passed away in 1984 from cancer.  I used to go to the cemetery a lot and talk with my mom.  I know she is in Heaven and wasn't going to answer me, but it made me feel better to talk to her.    One day, I was in the hospital and someone I did not know, died.  I was there to talk to one of their family members and so I was drawn into the experience just a little.  When I went home, I found it strange that the death of this stranger had shaken me up nearly as badly as the death of my own mother.    It's been twenty-four years since she passed away.  I still miss her.  I don't think of her as often as I did, but I still think of her.  I remember being a little kid and playing with her.  Or being a teenager and playing tricks on her.  I remember her love for every child she ever met.    And I remember it all over again every time I hear of someone else passing away.  The memories are no longer painful.  Sometimes they make me smile.  And they always make me a little sad.    As more time passes, I suspect that you will feel a little less.  But you will probably never stop feeling.

My  advice  to  you  is  to  stay  away  from  them  and  leave  them  alone  or  they  will  get  you  to  try  the  drugs   too.  They  will  tell  you  that  it's  not  bad,  just  has  a  bad  reputation.  Before  you  know  it,  you  will  be  using  the  stuff  too.  Get  away  from  them  and  leave them  alone;  they  are  poison.|`|0yUnnmdJaa	run away.|`|agNjPmBWaa	weed is a plant....not a drug  but crack cocain  is really bad tho  I would avoid both of them|`|bo3CuPzeaa	Unless you are tottally and utterly in love, then you should get out, it is so much worse being in a relationship like that then having a couple of months of heart break!

On a second note, let him know that you care about him and don't want him to mess his life up, let him know the importance of making decisions. Your not going to be able to make him quit, No one can, you can only support him quitting.     If he is your BF BF then i wouldn't get to close to him or you may get in hot water. Let her know how you feel and ask her about it.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Run and don't look back. There is so much trouble in your one little paragraph its not funny.

And you've got to tell your best friend what happened between you and her boyfriend, either tell her the truth and apologize, or live feeling guilty for the rest of your life - trust me you don't want that.     Well... sorry but I don't think there's anything you can do about their drug addictions, unless rehab or you persuade them not to do it anymore, but from what you've done.. who'd listen to you?  Sorry,   but I do hope everything works out.

However, be aware that European authorities can make it difficult.  There are too many scam-marriages for residency permits, so they will check you out thoroughly. Also, if you are too old (i.e. large age gap) it is possible they will refuse you entry other than a 90 day tourist visa.

I am enjoying feeling this way...|`|VP2fsPWzaa	it depends really...but don't blame yourself or any one else ... just tell yourself " well... it didn't workout ... i wil find someone who can make me happy "     anyways if you were deeply in love you may not be able to forget your relation and this is how it is... it is part of our nature to keep our past in our memories ( specially bad things remain longer )...    think positive and be open to a better relation...it might be just around the corner ;-)
6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Though breaking up is depressing, your life's far from over. It's important to see the end of a relationship as the beginning of a new chapter in your life. You are cringing about your virginity and your affinity with him being ur first love, thats all nonsense, stop thinking about your virginity, think about your future, and thank ur stars - maybe all the major issues where just an excuse to dump u for the new girl!!.     Here are a few tips on how to let go of your ex and move on with your life.     1. Be Nice To Yourself - Breakups happen to the best of us. Actually, they're a normal part of being a teenager. It's important to cut yourself some slack when you're feeling vulnerable and rejected. Let yourself mourn the loss, and remember that you don't have to be perfect all of the timeor any of the time. Nobody is!    2. Accept Your Single Status - Getting over your ex is virtually impossible if you're fantasizing about getting back together. It's important to learn how to be happy as a single person before you start to date again.    Being single gives you the freedom to do what you want, when you want. Watch a cheesy movie you would never admit to liking. Switch off your cell phone at the time your ex used to call. Perform a cleansing ritual, such as throwing away her yearbook photo or deleting his mushy e-mails. You'll be amazed how much better you'll feel.     3. Recognize and Release Your Feelings - Breakups can cause a range of unpleasant feelings, from deep sadness to intense anger. It's important to identify what you're feeling, acknowledge that it hurts, then let it go.    If you're struggling with the "letting go" part, try writing what you feel on a piece of paper, then ripping it up. When you're feeling really awful, taking a nap or going for a walk can help ease the pain and break the cycle of negative thoughts.    In general, try to get your demons out in a constructive way, such as sports, music, art or journaling. It's also OK to cry, scream and complain about how bad you feel. Find a secluded place to get out the nastiest feelings, then seek out friends and family to lend a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on.     4. Remember Your Ex's Flaws - It's easy to get teary-eyed thinking about his adorable brown eyes way of answering the phone. But what about your ex's not-so-great qualities? Remind yourself just how annoying, boring or insensitive your ex could be, and you'll be on your way to recovery.    5. Resist the Urge To Contact Him - One of the worst parts of a breakup is the loneliness. Use all the willpower you've got to resist calling your ex when you're feeling lonely and sad.    Though your ex may have been a source of comfort in the past, calling him or her for an ego boost will only make it harder for you move on. Look for new sources of support among friends, family members, counselors and online support groups.     6. Get a New Hobby - Without a boyfriend to entertain, you have a lot of freedom to try new things. Indulge yourself in some activities that didn't interest your ex, whether it's hockey, ballet or bird watching. Take a photography class, start writing poetry or join a club that interests you. You'll meet new people and feel good about yourself, which will attract both friends and admirers.     7. Don't Obsess About What Went Wrong - Many breakups don't have a specific cause. They tend to happen when two people have been growing apart for a while. This isn't to say you shouldn't reflect on what you could have done differently in the relationship, but it's not helpful to dwell on the whys and wherefores.    8. Move forward in your life - Im sure youve heard that saying, THE BEST REVENGE IS LIVING WELL Well, its true! If you are feeling jealous, the last thing you want is for your ex to know. Instead of focusing on what he is doing, focus on living the best life you can and before you know it,     Instead of focusing on the past, live in the moment and begin to dream about the future. You'll find a boyfriend who's at least as great as the last oneand perhaps a better match. Who knows? That special someone could be right around the corner.   Good Luck>r|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You'll get over it, don't worry. Time is a great healer.     How old are you, by the way? If you're under 20, the whole notion of spending the rest of your life with someone in particular is a pipe dream, not likely to happen. And I'm being realistic here.     Take out your anger and humiliation in sports or something.|`|Scupj6XVaa	it sounds like he was to much of a coward to tell you that he wanted someone else.  you need to know you are better off without him, you will be happy again.  get out with your friends and have a good time.  tell them what's going on and how you are feeling and let them give you some support.  good luck=)|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Chalk it up to experience and get on with your life.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Another case of buyers remorse.

It breaks your heart because every promise they made to you they have broken and he has broken your heart as well when he probs said he never will. It took me 10 months to get over my first love. It wasnt just losing the love of your life it was like losing a best friend too.  I cried myself to sleep, i didnt eat and all i wanted was him back. He got in touch a month after and just used me as a booty call. Make sure you don't make this mistake. He will be thinking about you, But whatever happened it was meant to be. You will be thinking about him every single minute of the day proberly. Its hard to forget but the best way i got over it was to get out with friends, take up new hobbies and make sure you ignore his texts and calls if he gets in touch. Which is hard but ex's do have a tendancy of keeping you wrapped round their little fingers.    Take care and keep your chin up. A new guy will come along and you will wonder why you even went out with your ex. Thats what i think now that im in love with my new boyfriend.    AJ.Xx|`|IDSHUio4aa	Okay, well it all just depends if your first time was special? I mean if it was your first time and it was perfect, i dont see why a boy has anything to do with it. You liked him at the time and other guys and better sex is right around the corner :D |`|kV7WKjtaaa	welcome to the club babe. I ask myself the same Question, will I get over him? guess what is working for me? heavy metal songs ( otep ) the song that is called blood pig.. just listen to it, plus I write in my diary everyday and when I remember him I say inside * you lose you moron. you will never find a girl who will love you the way I did.|`|XczuYnl7aa	GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE|`|t3G5xSbIaa	well i never faced such i am only 13 but ya know here's wat ya can do u know i got some experience from ma older sis.  lsn wat ya gotta do is leave him alone, i am sure there are may guys willing to take ya the more u wait the worse it gets cause you forget how to love someone else and then you just think about him and the thought he's long gone from ur hands just kills ya don't think u need him, if he don't need u that's it u don't need him u have to be confident and independent. the moment you get someone else the moment you'll fall in love with the other guy and 4get completely bout the other, i'm sure it would take long but i am warnin ya he don't need u, u don't beg!  good luck girl!|`|y0ZSj6ozaa	Well my first hurt me pretty bad too. lieing, the manipulating, telling me what to do. i understand. And I really loved him even though I was the one who broke up with him because i knew I couldn't be treated that way. Im still not over him, and your right, now i'm angry it didn't work. Maybe you should talk to him and ask him how he feels, if he can't be honest with you or tells you that he never really loved you then i would stay away from him. That's not even a true friend if he says that. But if he did love you, and has found somebody else, still be friends with him. You dont' have to talk to him all the time but when you do be respectful, if he did it because he was being a jerk being nice to him will make him feel guilty. And who knows, maybe he'll come back to you and apologize. You never know what can happen. Good luck|`|WfscVKQJaa	you WILL get over him  exactly the same thing happened to me  i went out with this guy for 2 years, i thought we'd be together forever and planned so much  so he took a lot of my teen years really, from 15 to 17.  then we split up, 2 weeks later he got back with his ex gf. i was absolutely gutted as i thought id never find anyone else  he sed he loved her, and sed a hell of a lot of cruel things to me with no reason or cause    so i moved on, forgot about him. were not friends now, because unfortunately there was a lot of hatred between us after everything that happened.   but im with someone else now and im so happy. i hardly think of my ex, hes still with the same girl but fortunately i dont ever have to see him.     you will and can get over him, u just have to be willing to. dont rush into any other relationships, ur friends will guide you through it and keep you company. get dolled up, go out to make urself feel better and have a good times with ur friends. friends are so important, theyll help you forget    good luck :) ull be fine xxx
8HewQkkoaa	Either, have a ceremony partly in english so you can understand what is going on properly...thats normal and people will understand.  OR  Get a copy of exaclty what the preist will say, and go through it with someone more fluent than you are. Make sure you understand every word of it, and discuss with your fiance and priest how you will answer.   I dont see anything wrong with having the priest ask the questions directly to you in english...and you replying in english. The german guests will get it just fine, and you can a decent amount of the main ceremony in german anyway - bible readings etc in german.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You simply get the book ahead of time, and go over everything with your fiance, or parents - whoever is German speaking.

That way it will be 'routine' when the time is there.|`|SgifdUUYaa	Sorry but i find this quite funny.  I think you should meet with the bishop/pastor before hand and get him to give you a written copy of what will be said.  Then practice practice practice!!!

I wish you the best of luck!  xx|`|v5jxTsLpaa	Don't feel bad, I am a 100% german, and IO have no clue how to speak it anymore, I forgot when I moved to the states.

Maybe u should talk to him about it!!|`|Yh63ysrzaa	That does seem very strange and uncomfortable for everyone involved.  Is his ex there when you do dinner?  How long were they together.  Maybe they are like the parents he didn't have growing up and he's having trouble breaking that tie.    If it makes you uncomfortable - don't go.  But be careful how hard you push him to not see them.  There may be more there than you are seeing on the outside.  There usually is.|`|em36L6Craa	yueah he's weird girl!!!!!!!!!    dump him    think about him..he seen to have no care of hjow u feel ryt?    he doesnt know how to treat a girl tsk|`|ZbRD5yhUaa	well, the fact that they invite you over with him makes the situation better. this way, they can't be trying to fix him and the ex back up. i would feel weird, too, but if he has a close bond with the parents, it has nothing to do with the ex. have lunch with them, but say NO if the ex will be there. that would be awkward.|`|ATh0ciALaa	hahaha um yeah thats weird i would not do it that entirely understandable hahaha i feel sorry for you|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Don't go and don't get angry if he does.  He is close friends with this family and you are lucky to be invited and welcome.

e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	First of all, your husband should go to the police, and explain the situation.    He should tell that the accusations are false (slander / defamation of character - nice law suit there) and that they are trying to force his mother to change her will.   If needed, he should give the address of her doctor so he could confirm the situation - and in case things go too slow, ask if he can go, with the 'escort' of one or two officers to prevent anything happening.    Do not wait too long.  You can deal with the scumbags later.    I wish you both the strength and wisdom to deal with this, especially given the painful circumstances in which this is happening.|`|FR1SoLteaa	You need to understand. Men have no rights.  So don't bring your husband with, see if they try to call the cops then.|`|nd4QSsr1aa	as an executor after her death he does have seniority over his niece.  you may want to avoid confrontation but it is evident that your mother in law is having mental problems as well as medical problems.  you may have to find an attorney to dispute her decisions and declare her mentally unable to place your niece in charge of medical information-  as far as the allegations of abuse- there is not proof of abuse and all signs point to the fact that he is a very affectionate son- seeing as though he is an executor- he should be able to have the duties of you mother in law's medical information and care stripped from your niece as well as have her removed from her home- but the best advice i can give you- Consult an attorney and find out what rights you have regarding the situation.
Yh63ysrzaa	She looks up to you, she wants to be like you.  What can you do?  Be less likable?  I mean, seriously...  But, honestly, tell her it bothers you.  Then explain why.  You may not get anywhere with her, but it may make you feel like you tried.    As for you changing your look - why?  She'll just do it again.  You need to be comfortable in your own skin.  Once you are, you won't care what she does!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery :)    In other words, you are a role model.

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.     8Love never fails."    1 Corinthians 13:4-8.|`|IcfoAI3naa	Love is:  missing them when your not together  waiting to see them again  hurting when they hurt  wanting to buy them something nice  making there pain go away  being there for them when they need you  being just a call away  thinking about them all the time  day dreaming of things to do for them  wanting to really making them happy  understanding them  being patent, when their mood is bad  be forgiving when wrong decisions are made  and loving them for their self|`|rzJ3WHENaa	sometimes you think you love someone but it could be just a heavy 'like.'  sometimes you can be infatuated (heavy crush) but that's all it is.   it could be that you are not in love with the person yet, but it would mean more if you said what you actually feel....like, 'i love being with you' or 'i love it when you laugh' or 'i love how you do that.'  that would be more honest then if you said 'i love you' but aren't sure you know what that is.  you will know when you love someone. it just feels different and when you say it, it will come from your heart.  hope this helps!|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Stop "using" the i love you thing.  You abuse those words and they lose meaning.  You will know when you are truly in love.    You know you are just saying empty words.  The first step is admitting it.  Love has no definition - everyone has their own dictionary when it comes to this.  Don't look for answers anywhere but within your heart.|`|YVEeGlFbaa	to me---the real meaning of love is the sacrifice you will do for one another. the actions taken for one another. if you respect each other and can deal with each other. if you can accept each others differences and go against certain odds together. there is an unexplainable feeling within, that feels good. to work with each other and have a chemistry that links you two together. actions prove more than words. they display love. words express the feelings inside and the reason why you do the things you do to each other. hope this makes sense. --thats what love is to me|`|deG4RMJhaa	at some point you got so used to saying that to each other  everyday so it gets rather meaningless.

Why dont you talk to him dirty on the phone instead you both would probably enjoy it.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I can see it being ok if he asked you and had your ok, but it sounds like he snuck around on your back and did it.

Why a man would do this when he has a girl friend is beyond me.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	I think people who do that are quite SAD i dont have a girlfriend and i wouldnt even do that|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Disrespect full and expensive.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	fk oath that is disrespectful.

No. Disrespectful.|`|xUy7B5vDaa	I would think of it as cheating, but hey, thats me.     I think its unacceptable and most of all dis-respectful!!    Talk to him as soon as you can, to understand why he has been doing this. Tell him how you feel, if he listens and is truly sorry then everyone deserves a second chance. Even if he doesn't seen anything wrong with it but knows how you feel then if he cares about you he will apologise and feel bad and wont do it again because of your views.|`|hHndD5SEaa	That IS disrespectful!! i would totally tackle him on this - you are totally within your right to discuss this with him  xx|`|WfscVKQJaa	some ppl even consider it as cheating  hes talking to other women and getting aroused by it  youve got every right to be mad at him and kick up a fuss!  sort him out|`|ATh0ciALaa	yes its disrespectful in some ways like if you no 100 percent he wouldnt cheat on you i think its fine its just porn it is up too you if you dont like it dont put up with it you dont need other peoples opinion plus the phone bill dam thats like $5a min for it|`|cL1198PBaa	Its is abit disrespectful to you yeah, its not fair on you.

89TgOjXpaa	Hi there,    i know how you feel my mother is the exactly the same  my father abused me when i was 6 and it continued to i was 15 and she deny's all responsibility for this and doesn't believe he could do such a thing she says and said she don' t know when this could have happened as she was always around , my advise is to continue to see your counselor as i see on too on a fortnightly basis and i see a shrink also as i have developed a mental illness due to the years of abuse my father caused me and he says he knows 100% i was abused as the illness i have was caused from severe sexual abuse    and will be writing up a report so that i can show my mother as she still doesn't believe it until its in writing ,  but i'm sorry what you are going through i know exactly how you feel try to tell everything to your counselor as she can help you the best maybe she could try some CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) and some drawings in books how you feel. sometimes writing in a diary can help ease the pain also its worth a try! i wish you the best!    if you want feel free to contact me!    Candice|`|tiopdRMWaa	oh dear, your mother SHOULD be concerned!    please, do get help, from counsellors, the police. sexual abuse is NEVER a good thing. hope you're doing okay.|`|xCgGDcdIaa	kids help phone ?  1-800-668-6868|`|2651822e8844588a4e782839c98ff665aa	NHS Direct 0845 46 47|`|KhmiBbBVaa	what the flock is wrong with you mother she should be there for you and give you love not just the opposite|`|nYgUfUd7aa	You are doing the best thing you can do by seeing a counselor.

yGPRntXFaa	She moved you from school for 2 reasons.  1 was to get you out of being there in your first school and getting bad memories of the loss of your friend and   2 to get you out of there so you can start fresh somewhere else and maybe get better grades... Both are really important. She did it as a parent thinking this is the best thing for you.  I'm so sorry to hear about your friend's loss.......... if you were my child, I would probably have asked you before changing you from schools... whether she did or not, she did for the better...thinking of you.    As far as your friend's death, you should try... not getting over it, but coping with it. It happens, death happens and it ******* sucks... but it will come to be when it wants and we have no control over it most times....    I'm also sure, she maybe doesn't want you to go to the same camp next year.. I would probably expect that too...    My best advice to you is for right now... try your best at your new school, you still have half a year of school, to do your best and finish... If you are doing bad in any subject (under 75) or C grades... then speak to your teachers and tell them you had the loss of your friend and it's affecting you and that you need extra help or tutoring or if you can make a special project to boost up your grades.... that will only help.    As far as your mom, don't hate her for changing your school, in her own way, she figured it's for your best............ now as far as all that happened... it CAN EITHER MAKE YOU OR BREAK YOU........ choose MAKE YOU... so it makes you a stronger person able to handle everything with grace, while taking her of your own responsibilities......    My name is Alex, from NYC. I'm 31 and I hope this helps....  Kindly let me know... Have a great day.  I wish the best to you and ask any questions you like...anytime...............I will do my best to answer...|`|QvRnCtr7aa	what should you do about your dead friend you ask? uh, what can you do? they are dead... people die.  hell, it could have been a lot worse.  half their brain could have been removed... that would suck worse than death.    as for your reasons for the transfer... i dont believe you.  parents don't move their kids to different schools due to a death of a friend... theres more to this story your not mentioning.  what really happened?  actually, i dont really care what happened.  just tell your new friends you knocked someone the f**k out and got thrown out of the school.  or tell them your teacher tried to touch you.  that will get them off your back.
jPDzVVHQaa	I have had it explained to me several times by various male friends, usually for a laugh whilst they're watching a football match seeing as I don't really follow football.(soccer in the US)     Is it that basically that an attacking player can't gain the advantage by entering the attacking zone whilst the ball is out of it if there are fewer than 2 opposing players in between them and the goal.    Its also vaguely explained in bend it like beckham with salt and pepper pots|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Uhhh......umm.......okay, fine I don't know.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I know the offside rule :)    That's about all i know.

et39TGIsaa	Hmm...he sounds like the typical online "boyfriend".  He's saying all the right stuff online, and even though you have seen him on the webcam, can you be sure he is who he tells you he says he is...not physically, but personality-wise, and mentally?  People can create all sorts of personas online.    I think that you should worry about your own approval of him right now, not your mother's.  When you meet him, make sure you go to a public place, during the day.  Bring a friend along.  I know that in your lovestruck mode this fellow is perfect, and the advice I am giving you here sounds just foolish, but you really don't know who this guy is yet.  And it is always better to be safe than sorry!    Your two religions might end up clashing one day, too.  Your mother WILL worry about this.  I know some Sikh doctors here, and they have become Americanized in many ways, but their religion is very, very important to them.|`|fa37a0de0a5be40d26be97dc0e9e16b8aa	well explain how you feel about him and ask your mom to meet him if she loves you then she wants you to happy and if he makes you happy... good luck and be careful|`|2Nu3sgZ2aa	get your mum to try him out first.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	I would stay away from a muslim myself.|`|rqSVDNbbaa	yeah good thought date her MOM ...........for good|`|eqaUMrYZaa	A white muslim, Lol.He's a real catch.|`|ycaloVnkaa	And people actually believe racism is extinct.......whatever..|`|lSl2Arlpaa	tell her she is prejudice and racist and everybodys still a person after all :)|`|ggKeBL7Laa	How old are you if you are above 18 your mom has nothing to do with it just dont listen to her it is your life|`|BJwhdvjoaa	if you really like this guy and not because of what he looks like on the outside but what in his heart then forget about what your mother cares about because you're the one this guy likes not your mom.

If he is a converted muslim, perhaps he could convert to sikhism.  I find most religions seem to have something in common somewhere.  Religious beliefs can be huge differences, but also it does depend on how flexible each person is and how open they are.  Look at the wars in the world - most are caused over religion.  By all means meet him, but don't get into anything really heavy until you find out way more about him.  Also some guys find it really hard to be 'just friends'.  I would say go for it, but be very careful.|`|7RU7p7traa	YOU ARE MAKING A BIG BIG BIG MISTAKE    read this again     YOU ARE MAKING A BIG BIG BIG MISTAKE    Ill tell you whay - you are only 17 and making a huge decicion which should be deffered till you are at least 22. And add to that - ill tell you why your choice is probably wrong    1 - Your fiance is a convert ...................only those people who are economically poor, socially inferior, emotionally vulnerable, intellectually slow or physically weak seek conversion to another religion. Are you sure your fiance does not belong in this category    2 - Your fiance has converted to Islam..............research has shown that neo converts to Islam are the most fanatical and dangerous.    read this and see what you are getting into, and what your fiance will be passionate about.................http://www.faithfreedom.org/book.htm    Marry him only if you are sure.

U need to know the person well before accepting him.  Racism is not an issue. If you think the person is good from heart and u think that mom does not have problem with it go ahead.  Dont go against your parents.  God Bless!|`|RBS5ngKQaa	Just maybe meet up with him a couple of times and see whether you both feel the same way first.  In the end your mum can't stop you from doing everything in your life. If you realise that he is a really good guy then explain all that to her. There is probably a lot more to him than just his religion.|`|Jmo5kMTQaa	browny points add up the prize of respect. I had a girlfriend once who the mother couldn't stand me n I couldn't stand her, so the next time I went over to her house I bought 2 bouquets of flowers, that kinda won me over with the devil woman. And after dinner that same night I took all the dishes to the kitchen and offered to help with the cleaning. That sorta petty crap - the mums really dig. If you can convince him to do these sort of things you should be looking at a successful relationship :)
QsDuEhFpaa	We seem to have a shield, I think. We protect ourselves from love, because it's so, so scary to give someone your heart. Giving someone your heart is the biggest, riskiest, most amazing thing in the world. And you're scared to give it to someone, because what if they break it?  What if they break it? What if they realise that you're not good enough for them, and they break it?  It's so scary to be a part of someone. To give them your whole self. It's an amazing thing, to give your whole heart to another.   But what if they break it? What if you can't put the pieces back together again, once they've left?  What if you're left forever with a hole where your heart used to be?|`|3fcccf19750497b4219fda41c7c3b8e3aa	Cause they have been hurt badly in the past and are protecting them selves in case it happens again!|`|AA11289793	Well it could be because they are scared because maybe they have never felt these emotions before, or that they have felt them before but it ended badly. It just takes time to people to admit it because they don't want to get hurt and/or don't know how to act once they are in love.|`|07NoBVpLaa	It's the self-esteem, they just don't know what will happen, and are afraid to get hurt.  So they pretend not to  notice their feelings.|`|nFzqGWBDaa	yea it can be  a self esteem thing. or they probably don't no what love is, cause it takes a lot to no what love is.|`|AA11148052	From my own experience, i am in love and its scary for some people, including me. Ive been hurt by alot of people in my life and its just that thing that sticks with you that you think cause you were hurt so bad before it will always be like that, you just gotta give the other person time to realize you are not like the others, love is scary|`|XR9XK7FXaa	their scared of rushing into it because they do love you, you have to be patient love is a strong.

Sorry but you are going to have to ask her and explain your point of view.    And by the way, i don't think you are in the wrong.

If I were you I would let it ride.  I know it may be hard cause you love her, but let her ride with whatever is keeping her interest.  Why be a fool and stress her to see you.  At this point I wouldn.t call her much less take her calls unless it was convenient for me.  Just really sit down and think about it........Do you really want to have to ''PERSUADE'' your so called girlfriend everytime you want to see her.  She really doesn't sound like she is worth it.  Maybe you need to know your worth and then you will know who is really worth your time and dedication!|`|6NPgEosOaa	Sorry but i think its pretty obvious, she doesnt love you and i dont think you should stay since she's always like this. I have a boyfriend and if he asked me to do that, i'l be overjoyed to stay with him, only thing is that ive asked him if he wantdd to marry me and like he says he doenst know , so that hurt me SO much.     but yeah in your case, if she really really loved you , she'll be there and you wont hav to feel that you're always waiting around her.      BUt why are you always waiting around her, dont you have friends?stuff you do on your own? Do something else, go to the gym buff up.     I think she's bored with you. she thinks you're a loser who cant find anybody else if she left you. She thinks she'll find somebody better, honestly i hate this kind of girlfriends. JUst dump her. find somebody better|`|5Kz145Auaa	maybe she didnt feel the same way you did while u were living together so she just needs some space after being together all the time for 2 years...im sure everything is fine...maybe try going out more and not staying at your flat and she might stay out later

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i would give the ring back, he gave it to u because he thought u felt the same for him, and u don't so give the man his ring back.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Keep it. He gave it to you so it is yours. You might want to sell it if it brings you back bad memories, but do not give it back to him and it is yours.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	If it was an engagement ring then give it back.  If it was just a normal gift, then keep it.  Gifts are for keeping, but engagement rings symbolise a promise that you've now broken.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Something doesn't sound right here??? They put a 4 Carat diamond on sterling silver??? Sterling silver isn't a strong metal??? I would think it would be GOLD?? BUT>>>  If the ring was intended for marriage, then yes you should give it back. But if it was just a gift, then NO you don't have to.|`|m81dfyOYaa	A 4 carat diamond would be set in white or yellow gold, not silver. And, if he's being a jerk about it give it back even if it was a gift. Why would you want it if you broke up with him, not worth the hassle IMO?|`|8txWayVnaa	If it was a gift, then it's yours to keep.  If it's an engagement ring, then you need to give it back--especially if you "didn't feel the same way."    And, if it IS an engagement ring, he could sue you and win, citing breach of "contract of theory".|`|0ZLgCzk8aa	Keep it! It was a gift.  Only way I would give it back is if it was a family heirloom of his. But if he bought it for you its yours!!|`|fHfVRcqbaa	First of all, it's not a diamond.  It is probably a CZ.  A 4 carat diamond would set him back about 20-50 thousand dollars and would not be set in sterling.    Having said that, I would keep it if he broke it off and return it to him if you broke it off.  That is the proper thing to do.|`|AA11328507	Giveth or keepth....what makes sense to you?|`|dEFap0Zaaa	You broke up with him.............give it back|`|AA10010935	If you were engaged to be married to him, then yes you have to give the ring back.    If it was really expensive, and you're not sure, talk to a lawyer about it, and see what he/she says.   Good luck.|`|GeruGGOQaa	If it was an engagement ring?  Give it back.  An engagement ring is a promise to get married and you broke the promise so the ring goes back.  That's even what one of the lady judges on TV told a girl with a similar case.    If it was simply a gift?  It's up to you but why deal with all the drama just give it back.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Just give it back, save yourself the drama.  If it really is a 4 carat diamond, I doubt it was just a gift.  It had to be some sort of promise/engagement ring, and since you ended the relationship, you voided the meaning of the ring.  Not only that, but why would you want to hold on to it?  It's only going to cause problems for you in the future.  I don't think the next man you get seriously involved with is going to appreciate the fact that you're holding on to your engagement ring from your ex.  Then he will come on here with a question along the lines of "I love her so much, but I don't think she's over her ex - she still has her engagement ring from him."  Just get rid of it now and avoid current and future drama.|`|WMkJ1GQyaa	You should give the man back his ring. Its the right thing to do. Its his property now. My ex gave her ring back to me immediately without me asking. It also helps you forget about him.|`|xNF04OfJaa	Give it back, why would you want to keep a ring if you are not going to marry him. Are you just going to wear a engagement ring around your finger just because and then when someone ask you who is the lucky guy, you say no one.
ufTjv25Jaa	Just talk to him like usual and be yourself. Get to know him better, and then decide. First crushes are hard, because you never really know if you like them, because at that age your hormones are raging ;)  SO just wait, and if you decide you really like him, tell him how you feel. You wouldn't;t believe how many relationships have been wasted coz someone didn't reveal their true feelings.|`|1lhCBhdVaa	i think he is not a great guy dont waste ur time after him.|`|RD2xHWPoaa	Thats kind of hard to answer... I would give him your phone number (since he asked) and then when he calls. See where the conversation goes. At first dont talk about how you like him, give your friendship a chance to catch up and maybe after a while, he will want to be more. Good luck!!|`|BJwhdvjoaa	Look if you like this guy as much as you say than just tell him thing will be so much easier if you just tell him how you feel. Trust me|`|7541af920534320050bed438788e7151aa	Go for him|`|eqaUMrYZaa	OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG (stomps feet like little girl) Like nowayyyyyyy , git outta hurrrrrrr.    " U WANNA BE MY GIRLFRIEND " he is such a heartbreaker.      "Do you think he likes me?" Yes he does , I know it.He is a vampire , like the one from Twilight.A car will comes crashing towards you and he will put his arm out and it will crash into his arm and save you , but he wont be hurt cause he is a vampire.    This is so cute.|`|nkxE1DGMaa	the best thing to do about it is to talk to him alone about how u feel|`|PGCKZl1Laa	Oo first crushes they are hard. Well it is hard to say if he is one of those continuous flirts or if he really is into you, maybe you should try talkin to him. play it cool things will usually work out. Good luck!|`|KCViivzdaa	Talk to him.    He's probably as inexperienced with this as you are. Just talk to him, and see where it goes from there. But don't expect TOO much, even if you do start going out. High school relationships have a horrible track record of lasting any significant amount of time.|`|UEI4PEUhaa	now, honey! i already answered your question but you didn't say anything about him asking you to be his girlfriend before! now. if he asked you then go for it! but if he asked someone else right after he asked you, then he probably isn't worth all the fuss. but if you really like him then ask him if he still wants to do the bf/gf thing-- if he's NOT currently in a relationship. don't worry about your little giggle fit you had when he first asked you... there's nothing you can do about that, it's in the past. but i doubt he really cared. he probably thought it was cute. :) i always tell myself that when i totally screw up a great situation, but i think it's true! just tell him how you feel. but if he just wants a girlfriend, not a RELATIONSHIP, then don't bother. i think you really like him but you shouldn't waste your time with someone that doesn't really car about your feelings, just their relationship status. good luck, sweets! :)
WDs4fRoxaa	You should tell your dad that you want to live with your mom.    It sounds like he wants to move on with this new woman, and  is afraid of losing her because of his kids.    Instead of being a man about the situation and having the woman  accept him as a package deal...he is shoving you out.    It worked with your mom and now he is doing it to you.    He should have no trouble letting you go.    If he says no, tell him that you no longer feel comfortable  living with him.    Best wishes|`|YhZM84P1aa	I think you should talk to your dad about whats bothering you and if you get into an argument about it and feel like you cant take it anymore you should leave.|`|uhBkbgoaaa	HONEY , FOR YOUR BEST INTEREST IF ITS THAT BAD AND YOUR MOM IS INVITING YOU TO COME THEN DONT LOOK BACK AND PACK UP. I HAVE A FATHER WHO PUTS ME DOWN EVERYDAY BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHATS IT LIKE. DO WHATS BEST FOR YOU, ASK YOURSEL "WHAT ABOUT ME? WHAT ABOUT MY STRESS?"|`|oRzqWhsDaa	go live with your mom I hope you can do it good luck|`|7CuotevFaa	Okaaaaaaayyyy  I have experienced your situation but from the opposite side; your father's side:  My wife has your exact Character and i think i have your father's so you are familiar with our relation it's full of .....tension and fights until....yesterday,yes,yesterday was the day when i accidentally discovered the cure to our relation. She done one of her act in a public place and embarrassed me in front of many important people cause she thinks she have right when it was very obvious that she haven't so as we were heading for the car and i was furious but still haven't say a word she began to justify her acts.... when i said :"...never mind we'll find another place to go to..." i said that cause I've learned not to fight in the car and i wanted to wait till we get home so... after saying that she thought I'm a god and she respected me a lot for not starting a fight and kept talking all night of how great i was for doing that.  As i said a total accident and the answer is not for you, the answer is for you r father :  LIIIIIIIIIIIIE  , KEEP LYING and everything will be alright|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Move out and go to your mum's NOW|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Sounds like your dad has a few issues.  Are you able to talk to his new girlfriend? Is she approachable?  Maybe you can try to talk to her and let her know that you don't dislike her and discuss some of the issues you have with your dad  maybe she will understand and talk to your dad.  If not, I would consider possibly moving to your moms for your peace of mind and sanity.  Your dad should be there for you and make you feel safe in your home if you can't make him understand that what other choice do you have but to go where you feel safe and loved.|`|AA12324252	Work something out with your Mom, it will turn out OK. She knows what your going through. Good Luck Honey!
QsDuEhFpaa	You probably should be, I agree. But your mom wants what she thinks is best for you. As in, she doesn't want you to be involved in anything that could hurt you. Not just physically. But yeah, that too. And depending on her views, she might also be concerned about your "purity".  But if I were you, I'd just go to a nice cafe where you can sit on a couch and cuddle and be comfortable.   There's probably no use in fighting with your mom on this issue. Though you should bring it up calmly and ask her what's up. But still, you don't want to make her madder, and then not let you guys see each other at all.|`|fa37a0de0a5be40d26be97dc0e9e16b8aa	well then cuddle in front of her lol|`|2hAuIg5baa	im 19 and my boyfriends not aloud in my room its bull|`|teisU4E2aa	i think u should be able to be in your room with your bf with the door open|`|ddP3klT3aa	I don't think it matters what we think. If you want to sit and cuddle, go to his house. You are living in your mom's house, so you have to follow her rules. If you want to cuddle, go park some where in a secluded area.   Honestly, I don't like it when kids "cuddle" in front of their parents. I think holding hands is ok. But hanging all over each other or even making out is disrespectful to parents whether they see it or not. I am only 20, so its not like I am old fashioned. I would never do that stuff in front of my mother or my father.   I am married now and still don't. ha ha. I might give him a small peck on the mouth, but I don't like seeing any one being all "cuddly" so I don't do it in front of others.|`|8EsicBxUaa	You are over 16, so i cant see why not , but maybe your mother is being protective.. Everyone knows that you would not just cuddle.. I'm sure at some point it would lead to further activities, and your mother is aware of this... She is only protecting you..    I am 22 and my bf is 27 , he is not allowed in my bedroom...  I am allowed to stay at his, but he is not allowed at mine , and that is all because of my dad whodoesn'tt like the fact that i am growing up,.|`|AA11289793	Yeah I think your both young adults and that you should be able to have alone time together, just convince your mum that you are not going to do anything that you don't want to do, i.e. sex.    Just tell her that "You don't feel properly comfortable with him when you can't be alone and all you want to do is be able to have the chance to talk with him and get to know him properly, but you never feel comfortable in his car or round his house or in public and that you want to be able to truly know him but you won't let me"    Well something along those lines, but just try and convince her that you want to be alone for innocent reasons...|`|G7sANdhFaa	i believe you should be able to cuddle.|`|KCViivzdaa	You're probably responsible enough.    Try to compromise. Tell you mother that you guys will hang out in your room, but leave the door open a crack, and allow your mother access at anytime.    Gain her trust, and she'll become more lenient.|`|nkxE1DGMaa	yea yall should be able to do that  but u kon moms shes probi not gonns change her answer   if yal want to do that a different place|`|u84hPxW1aa	Well, it is her house. She should at least leave you in a room by yourself if not the bedroom. Maybe you two can work something out. Make sure you tell her why you want to be alone (don't say to cuddle). Say so you two can have one on ones and feel like you have some conversational privacy.|`|UsGF7haFaa	i think you should be alone im pretty sure your mom can trust you she should at least let yall go in ur room wit da door open at least...|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	Hmm. You'd have to wait a while longer maybe its sex shes concerned about. But besides that I think she just thinks its not right to have her daughter in her room with her boyfriend knowingly. She might not want to make it seem shes running a place for her kid to get jiggy in her house. I've run into this problem to with my mom and it was for the same reason. :/ It was kinda lame for a while.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	It's your mom's house, so its really her decision if you two get to be alone in your room.    Talk to your parents though, tell them that you understand why they don't want you alone in your room with your boyfriend... but ask if you can go in your room and leave the door wide open.|`|07NoBVpLaa	I think that you should be allow to sit talk and cuddle, is naturaL that you want some alone time with your boyfriend,  but your mom is just being mom, she is just worry and wants to protect you, so try to understand her.  Is only natural that she would want you out of your room, but I think you should be able to spend some time alone in your own living room.|`|cjACzlTRaa	your moms right.... Period your a minor|`|AA11148052	I think you need to respect your mom's house, its not upto you to make up the rules , its upto your mom and one day you will really be glad she wouldnt let you. If you need to be alone with him so badly in a private area, go rent a hotel room or ask your mom if you can leave the door open, but respect your mom she is wise|`|b8VNVGTqaa	he is UR bf not ur mums so its ur decision hun     y dosent she let u naywayy|`|nLwhsUv7aa	err it sounds like your mum is worried that you you know will get up to something she wouldn't approve of. Have you tried talking things out with her? maybe this is what the two of you need. good luck|`|9ZYDC6reaa	yes you should be able to as long as your only cuddling ; ) lol but ya even on the couch. Wow im sorry to hear your mom is like this your both are going to be 18 soon|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well I can see your moms concern. She's just looking out for you.  Why can't you and your boyfriend cuddle on the couch in the living room and watch a movie or something. Compromise with your mom and let her know that you all want some alone time if not in your room then in the living room.|`|7541af920534320050bed438788e7151aa	No problem|`|l0QinWFGaa	as long as your 18 your mom basically owns you, she can tell you whatever she wants as long as it is reasonable and you cant do nothing by law.  But i do feel that it's a little stupid why she won't let you.  I think your mother is over-protective.  Personally I'd do it anyways, whatever, mothers aren't always right.|`|vXf2rrYraa	hehe i had the same thing happened to me. OK well have you tried talking to your mom? you can always make it a point that your not gonna do anything wrong , and if that doesn't work then go out and have a date just you and him to a movie or park to have a picnic thats always fun. Well if you planing to talk to your mom then talk to her as if she was your friend and don't be scared talk to her woman to woman. =]    Good Luck!!!
aUbxn1eYaa	Lol Frankii! It's Me! I Found The Question!    Yehh! Why Are You Stereotyping Me..!    Even Though..It's Obvious I'm A Nerd/Geek...    Whats Wrong With Looking Like Wednesday From The Addams Family :'(    Btw, Thank You People For The Nice Answers :) x    Lol|`|zKUUWqeTaa	why are you stereotyping your "friend" anyways?|`|QPwrLdUxaa	why do you have to classify her as anything in particular? Can't she just be a girl with varying interests?|`|WaZc4TGfaa	ppl are all different. it doesn't matter what she likes. if she's a good friend then u shouldn't probably care if she's a nerd or geek or whatever freak she is. And about the looks kinda creepy.
OHfZFR31aa	If you slept with him right away, then he just wants you for sex. You can't turn a one night stand into a relationship - or it's VERY rare to do so. If a guy is really into you, he won't pressure you into sex right away. In fact he'd wait around for months if that's what it took    If you had unprotected sex last night, go right away and get the morning after pill. If you take it within 24 hours of intercourse, it's about 90% effective. It gets less effective the longer you wait. You can get it at any pharmacy.    If he likes you he will contact you, but don't count on it. You already slept with him so he doesn't have anything else to look forward to.|`|hUyhLeDWaa	1) Morning after pill    2) If he doesn't reply for a while then he's not interested..    3) If he does contact you and comes to yours and tries it on with you straight away..Then he's only in it for sex..    4) If you dont have sex That day/night OR If you hint for sex then he's not in it for sex|`|PovR8mPGaa	Look how is behaving with u.  If he is ignoring u then I might tell u he is a player and he was playing   with u.  GOOD LUCK FOR UR LOVE|`|jNQbVDHSaa	u used each other, but the sad bit is going on unprotected. also what were u going for, may be u had similar goals (ONS)|`|X1YVUA5oaa	You should never have slept with him until you was in a relationship with him for  a GOOD while, one night stands have never really done any woman any good, I hope you learned your lesson. Only time will tell, all you can do is not have sex with him again and hope he has actual feelings for you and wants to actually date.  There is a good chance he just used you,  I wish you good luck.|`|b8VNVGTqaa	ask 1 of ur mates to put on a balclava and steal ur purse while u 2 r together if he chases ur friend then he likes ya if he says "oh nvm hope there was noin important in there" then hes in 4 sex!|`|49nLhin5aa	you could text him to meet up but you should also go to the doctors if you think your pregnant or contracted a something, if you want to see if he is only in it for sex then hold out and see if his personality changes and if starts to ignore you if so id say he only in it for that.|`|tqyqMvJIaa	guys are confusing because some guys will tell you anything and everything to get what they want. but some guys are acual nice guys and want you for you. maybe after that night he got scared and is trying to push his feelings aside because he dont know how you feel. you should tell him how you feel. and if he doesnt want to try to make it work then hes probly not worth it. i dont know the whole story thats just what i see. :) good luck.|`|H42WbQATaa	You should be able to tell.... trust me, i act different around girls i find "hot" and girls i find "cute". If he treats you like he thinks your hot, get rid of him quick. I know its a weird answer but a guy would know what im talking about. We never refer to a girl were really interested in as hot.     and wait for him to contact you. don't call him AT ALL again, if hes really interested in you for you....then he'll be quick about seeing or talking to you again. As far as the unprotected....no one can help you there, don't do it again.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	There is really nothing you can do but wait.  Except consider the morning after pill of course.  Trust your instincts.  If you don't think he's keen or wants to see you again then you are probably right.  Learn from this experience and be careful not to put yourself in the same position again.|`|YVEeGlFbaa	did he text you back after you text him? if he likes you he will contact you again and not just for sex. Yeah, I would make sure that the relationship doesn't turn into a booty call thing. Like movies, a bite to eat or just a day to hang out sounds like a plan for the next meet up.    And maybe text him differently next time--maybe a simple, hey what is up..The only hard part is that you did not use protection. Just hope that he is clean !!! I think the main concern should be the -no protection thing right now- your health and future plans are more important right now...So, if it is worrying you. Call him and try to get a hold of him. You were already intimate, so you should feel comfy asking him if he has any diseases.  If he gets offended, then he is a jerk. He should understand your concerns, it is a big issue..Forget about the game of waiting to call, I'd wanna find out...|`|OKvqRBGMaa	oh well you cant change what happened but react to it instead.  book yourself an appoitment at the doctors to check for STD's.   and other thing..you ve texted already once..wait for a reply dont force him to txt you..that way you'll know how serious he was about you if he texts back on his own..     good luck and keep your dignity  xxx|`|6NPgEosOaa	you should never ever sleep with a guy that you think you might like after you've just met them! that's like openly telling him that you're easy and available. Of course he wont take you seriously, how can he? he'll be thinking of how easy it was for all the other guys in getting you. guys need to chase! nobody wants something if it comes for free you know..  i think its pretty much a lost cause now..dont call him or text him anymore!! let him do the chasing, if he really wants you he'll get to you. think of this as a lesson and dont do something so foolish the next time round. Especially unprotected what were u thinking!!! do you even know this guy? what bout STDS and HIV?? u shud go see your GP right away and start checking stuff out.    never sleep with anyone ever on the first date if you want him and ALWAYS use protection...  if you like him, make him wait, at least 3 - 6 months, get to know him better as a person first.|`|x4gSFF3Paa	He used you?    How did you work that one out.     Unless you had an agreement to be forever lovers before you jumped into bed with him then I think he could easily say the same!    If he doesn't make an effort to come back to you then notch it up as another one night stand!    Suggest you rush to your chemist now for a 'morning after' pill    After that make an appointment with  your local GUM clinic and get tested. and don't have sex until you are all clear.    For future ref do not have unprotected sex with 'strangers' but I guess you have already been told this before!    Good luck|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Don't have sex for a while and see how he reacts.
Wi9nmYIEaa	you sound like a bunny boiler  :O|`|dRj9FoHzaa	You sounded too desperate.  Maybe you should work on that first and also change your username.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	That just proves that once a woman hit's 40, she's soooooo much wiser.........|`|ma6Re8B1aa	WHY???your weird.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Then start visiting chat rooms, not this site....|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Maybe they're put off by your creepy user name, "lick women feet".  Because, ew!|`|AA11328507	Nope!|`|p6QizgmRaa	I would suggest you change your name if your looking for women to even chat with, let alone anything more than that.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	Do what girlie girl said...........good answer|`|AA10010935	You're a sad strange little man.  Go somewhere else!|`|SrSfZJTKaa	It's because you are looking in the wrong place. You are saying you want to 'chat' what you really mean is you want to do foot related cyberstuff. Women aren't stupid, we can smell this a million miles off. There are many sites devoted to foot fetishes, why not try them, you would have a higher success rate. Just google 'Foot fetish chat' and away you go.
tC6MG0nyaa	no, never happened to me.|`|tXlvg1ahaa	There was this guy on my bus route who got on the bus every day and had a habit of sitting right opposite me.  As time went by we first started nodding to one another as he found his seat, then one day I found my self actually reserving his seat for him by preventing anyone from sitting there with my school bag, and removing it just before he got on. So one day he saw me doing that as I lifted my school bag and that started us chatting and that same afternoon, he actually asked if I would go to his place with him for some sex.  By then I felt that we had known one another for ever and accepted the invite.  We had a full afternoon of sex and it was wonderful....  I will never forget it, but still to this day, I do not know his name.  It was just that one day we did it, and he never got on the bus again.  I was 13 going for 14 and he must have been about 24 then.|`|JhLt2Vrqaa	no really itd be fun tho|`|z4vQbN1zaa	That's your choice and thinking style. Now a days sex is a common for some girls and sex  is serious affairs for some others. So I dont know you are in which catogery.|`|VtQtObRzaa	sexi oman|`|llQwjX5Raa	No I have my own BF.|`|SLy9xFwkaa	what like you think shes hot and you and her like run somewhere and do it then part ways and dont talk untill the next day?   happens all the time.|`|FzFSzilmaa	no... been sexually attracted to a work colleague and had sex... :D|`|NXT4sTqIaa	yeah of course. it is common for all, until they get their own wife or Husband
Fnsea1sMaa	ahh i hate typing on my ipod!    but i think maybe he's trying to tell you that he likes you, without doing anything too scary (i.e. talking to you, becasue he's probably really scared about doing that).    so yeah next time, stare back for a while, then break it off, and smile at him  hopefully he'll smile back and know that you're interested!|`|g5ShGjszaa	He's probably shy like you were originally thinking.  I wouldn't look into it any deeper than that.  Some people just don't smile all that much either.   I know I don't. Was taught it's a ***** thing to do when I was younger so don't.
M5XE0ycCaa	Hmmm sounds like a case of fatal attraction.    Well my friend I think its time you stood up and came clean.  You need to explain to your wife how sorry you are and why it happened.  There is a good chance that you may lose her as well but thats the point you are at.    Ask for forgiveness and offer to do what ever it takes including counselling.  then ask her to help you tell the other girl to hit the road.    In most cases this really isnt going to turn out well but you need to be prepared to take your bumps.    Below you can find some great relationship articles that just may help you in your quest|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Under the circumstances, I believe that you simply need to walk away. Give the simple explanation that you are riddled with the guilt of how worthless you are to both of them, and that you're going to tell your wife and let her make the decision to remain with someone like you.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	oh dear lord    forgive them for they know not what they do.|`|4AbXxowTaa	You've dug your on grave on this one.  You deserve it.  The right thing to do is to come clean, which would probably mean leaving both of them and starting your whole life over.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Just stand up to her, look her in the eye, and firmly say, "It's over."    You don't have to be trapped if you don't want to be.  Come on, man, where are your testicles?|`|gSwobfujaa	i dont know what side of the affair youre on. are you the one who is married or is she? either way you could be being used. the only way to get out is to actually leaver the situation and not go back. sorry, i know it sounds simple, but thats bc it is simply that simple. nothing will ever come of this affair. in fact, only bad things will come if anything. get your priorities together, get your morals back on track, and gain some respect for yourself and the real people who will be getting hurt from the situation. no one is going to feel sorry for you and the other person involved in this affair. so step up and take responsability. be the bigger and better person and walk away from it. hopefully, you can gain self respect back when its all said and done.|`|Wch2WybQaa	man up dude!|`|I814g6ZBaa	Tell her its over and don't call anymore, or text, or email, or stop in, or go back to the same bar... or ANYTHING again -- ever.  Not even once.  Each day will get better.  Change your numbers if you have to.    The only thing you cannot control is whether or not she'll tell your wife; and those consequences will be all yours to suffer.    Good luck.  You can do it.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Give her an ultimatum. Tell her it's you or him. If she's not willing to leave her husband, than you know that she was using you just for sex. If she truly loved you, she would leave her husband and stop playing sharade with both of you. You deserve someone 24/7, not part time.

So do.|`|Apm88mVTaa	I'm guessing you are the "other man"?    I am on the other side of the equation and I too want out so I feel your pain Bro.  I am married and I started an affair with a married woman.  Things were great but she got a divorce and is now the "other woman".  This is not what I was bargaining for.  She requires too much of my time and I need to get out somehow.    So that said, maybe she wants to get out as well?  Have you talked about it?  You need to be up-front with how you feel.  Tell her you need a 24/7 girlfriend.  Maybe she loves you enough to leave and be with you.  If so that is great!  But if she's not then you need to cut loose and move on.|`|e5FoLh2Paa	You made your bed--now "lie" in it.  Your deserve all the hell, torture and punishment you're getting.

We love their bodies, their touch, their actions, just about everything. And obviously we like them when they're being sensual.    So most guys enjoy seeing two seperate girls being sensual together. It's like a double doss of things that guys like. Sure they would enjoy kissing the girl, but seeing another beautiful being kiss her is appealing to them as well.|`|A0IvDqsGaa	It's a guy thing. I think every mans fantasy is to be with 2 girls at the same time. So it is definitely a guy thing. Just like girls talking about their feelings...it's a girl thing.|`|cjACzlTRaa	Because in your head you seem them naked in your mind.

cUgtkGdVaa	Don't go out with your ex, yet, and especially without talking to your boyfriend about the whole thing. Let the birthday party go and talk to him about it on saturday, maybe he doesn't know that you would enjoy spending time with his friends...  good luck|`|BJwhdvjoaa	Two things   1) either tell him you want to tag along the worse he can give is some lame excuse then just tell him you'll go anyway  2) STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND YOU GO OUT AND HAVE YOU SOME FUN THEN HE'LL WANT TO SEE WHAT YOUR DOING!!!!!|`|gD8IGxwmaa	Honestly..  its probley not what you want to hear but in the back of your head i bet its what you have been thinking.  CONFRONT HIM  but not just blurt out.. your going out how come you havent invited me?  if he has normally invited you and now he isnt  maybe somethings bothering him?  or maybe he needs some space  well i only know that from past experiance with my ex,  maybe you could say to him  give him a KISS AND A KICK.  by saying i think its really good that you want to go out and have a good time with your friends..  but maybe could i maybe come along with you sometimes because i miss your company..    in a relationship one of the most important things is being able to have the connection with them to be able to ask them whats on our mind  i guess us girls sometimes forget that =P  good luck!!|`|zmxNjL5saa	yes, it can help due to the condition you and the person are within|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Tell  him  at  the  last  minute,  just  before  he  walks  out  the  door  what  your  plans  are.  If  he  genuinely  cares  for  you,  he  will  change  his  plans  or  invite  you  to  come  along.  But  one  thing is  for  sure,  you   will  be  "up-dated"  on  where   you  stand  with  him  in  the  r/s  department.  Do  it!|`|2hAuIg5baa	omg that is brilliant!   make sure you tell him your meeting up with some friends and ur ex is going to be and if he gets annoyed tell him you just dont want to spend another friday night alone, and i can nearly garentee hell ask you to go so he wont be paranoid! if he doesnt get the picture,then next friday when he goes out again lie and say your meeting up with them again!  it will work i promise|`|iOI2RT6maa	Going out with an ex is NEVER ok. If my wife ever went to 'hang out' with an ex, I'd divorce her in a heartbeat.|`|e7uUfLsqaa	I wouldn't go out with the ex.  I wouldn't like it, and most ppl wouldn.t    On the other hand, I think you should let him know your feelings about him not taking you out on fri's and see how it goes from there.    Good luck|`|et39TGIsaa	Have you tried talking to your boyfriend about how much this is starting to bother you?  You all seem to have a slight communication problem.  At least that's how I see it.    Just sit down and have a heart-to-heart with him, hun.|`|9002243f0fe92d658f5205b2667e158daa	Going out always with his friends and not showing you to them sounds strange, at least from my perspective. Going out with your ex is even stranger. This all seems as one of Jerry Springer's episodes.|`|qIDBrSmnaa	Run...|`|g5ShGjszaa	Maybe it's a good idea to wait to ask like you're saying, but you should probably let him know.  There's a chance he doesn't want to hang out with both you and them at the same time, but he just might not be thinking straight.  Some guys miss things like that.|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	You know what?  You need to talk to your boyfriend about this because it just seems weird to me that you would choose going out with an ex-boyfriend (so as not to be lonely) rather than communicate with your boyfriend.  If you want to go out with your ex, there's some emptiness you are feeling in your relationship, and it is coming from your boyfriend.  Talk it out.  If you never talk to him, are you willing to have him hang with his dudes over and over again over you?  Having his buddies that he sees a lot, and you, means he's perfectly content.  But you aren't.|`|dzNnf3LHaa	I say he doesn't invite you because he wants to be seen as uninvolved.  Dump him, he is no good for you.  If he doesn't even think to invite you to tag along with him, he is self absorbed.  Go with your ex, at least he wants to hang out.  Who cares what your bf thinks, obviously he doesn't care what you think.|`|ggKeBL7Laa	If I am Your boyfriend and i see that you went out with an EX !!!!    I would Kick your ***|`|fkpAunlMaa	My ex is one of my best friends. My girlfriend is cool when I go out for a drink with her.    I dont see it as a big deal. Unusual but I have afew ex s as friends but friends is all they are.    Some people dont like it so ask your boyfriend he might invite you to the party after all.|`|reDImGj1aa	I did this myself as my ex was wanting too much of my time, so I backed off.  I don't see why he could not have invited you to the 30th birthday party though.  Either find a hobby, a new interest or something similar.  Don't just sit around home moping and waiting to see him the next day.  But my advice - once an ex is an ex - they are in your past and that is where they should stay.  You broke up for a good reason and that reason never normally goes away.  TALK to your boyfriend, have a heart to heart and tell him how you feel.  Go out with a girlfriend for drinks perhaps to take your mind off him if he does not want to see you Friday nights.|`|H42WbQATaa	Wow, is he cheating on you? No? So why is it that your meeting up with an ex for a drink? Sounds to me like your using the fact that he has friends that have nothing to do with you..... to make you feel better.     Get your own friends, don't blame your boyfriend because you dont have a life.He DOESNT have to take you everywhere.     lol "just meeting an ex for a drink, were just friends" yea w/e go cheat on your bf and get piped on friday loser .
zaMTz8z5aa	Ummm..YES!! of course you should. if she is giving emotional support and exchanging confidences with someone else and you don't know about it or understand....then why is that not cheating on you?    When you cheat on someone you betray their trust.    I don't think that always has to be about sex. Love is about lots more than sex.|`|AA10010935	If you're worried, talk to her about it.   It's important to communicate.|`|UzvoQvB2aa	tell her to stop talking to him unless it's work related|`|HrvOuJMBaa	sell all her stuff and leave him a message on a billboard prehapse he will learn not to care|`|vYeTegZNaa	i think youre beeing to obsest with who youre wife speaks with .. just give her some space.. it seems like you have a problem with trust ... i think a good chat is needed with youre wife about this situation ..tell her that this has been bothering you ..|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Be the man and get in to that car and go slap that guy right accross the face............  SEVERAL TIMES|`|Aamu069waa	ask your wife about it. if your married you should be able to talk about anything openly.  i would tell her that you are uncomfortable with her emailing this guy and ask her to stop. but since its just an email, you might not need to worry about it, until she starts to go out by herself or with her Friends with out you.|`|bxlv6ng3aa	no don't be worried, because you get to wake up next to her everyday, he don't. what you have with your wife he will never have because she married you, no matter what he says in those emails remember she picked you.....|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Talk to her about it.   But i'm sure the'res nothing to worry about if he knows that she loves you.|`|hHndD5SEaa	If she knows that he loves her and is continuing to email him, even if she is being honest about her feelings for you, then I think you should talk to her about it. Shes leading him on - be it intentionally or not, and thats not right.xx|`|AfbjU9Guaa	No, because it'll ruin your relationship. You need to go with your wife's reassurance and trust her. Don't think any more into it please.|`|b2c6aab2836dad6dd78c58c4f1697006aa	Im not sure, depends if you can trust your wife or not    Tell your wife your not comfortable with her emailing this guy, see what she says?|`|uhBkbgoaaa	YES YOU SHOULD, ASK HER WHAT IS GOING ON , THE WOMEN IS NOT SINGLE ANYMORE.  IF MY MAN FOUND ME TEXTING WITH ANOTHER MEN ,HE WOULD KILL ME|`|Wytd3dajaa	Tell her to stop it now or she can face the consequences. Not only is she talking to a guy who is in love with her whilst she is married, but it's not fair on the guy she is talking to either. He can't ever have her, so she's leading him on and being borderline unfaithful with that knowledge. Give her a warning.|`|XcoUc9DVaa	seems like you are already worried about it dude if you are asking a blog thing to help you    my advise   kill the guy
KCViivzdaa	Get over it.    And the best way to do that is to practice it. Eating is completely normal, and no guy will look at you 'strangely' for eating in front of them.    Suck it up, and just do it. It'll take a bit of effort the first few times, but you'll become comfortable with it in no time.|`|UJ6D0Wm5aa	I remember feeling that same way. I was embarrassed by how I might look while eating. Trust me they are not at all paying attention to that. I think they would rather see you eat a meal then watch you pick at a salad.|`|mIyLsYPxaa	EAT *********!!!!!!!!!!|`|gqHy3821aa	Just eat, it's more awkward when you are not eating and the guy is, believe me. (Awkward for the both of you).    Forget about expectations because there aren't any, and just relax.|`|reDImGj1aa	I feel the same way and I am probably at least twice your age!  It is shyness actually I believe.  Maybe try to get yourself over it by eating something really tiny the first time you see him.  I feel for you as in the past I have spent all my time worrying about eating food in front of others.  I hate eating in front of crowds - like work colleagues.  It is darn embarrassing I find!|`|A0IvDqsGaa	dude just eat. everybody eats. sooner or later you are going to have to eat in front of guys. guys like girls with an appetite anyways. I am pretty sure that if you go out with a guy, he would much rather you chow down on a hamburger or steak than get a little garden salad with a piece of bread. If you sat there and ate a piece of bread, he will probably see you as insecure, which isn't good. So grow up a little and just eat, its part of life.|`|2dke6ChJaa	just eat, relax, it's fine|`|K1oOQqqVaa	I think you should get over it and start growing up.|`|zJ282m3naa	overcome it honestly no one cares whether you eat in front of someone , only you care so don't let it show , eat normally (don't tell him you don't like eating in front of people) he won't even notice your problem|`|eqaUMrYZaa	AWWWW how sad , just tell him you already ate .Or just tell him the truth , see what he says.It will show if he atleast cares a little bit about you.|`|9z5NASypaa	im sure boys think you are extremely weird if you don't eat in front of them. Why would you be worried about it? Eat girl EAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|se4W82zbaa	I think it kinda depends on why you find it difficult to eat in front of boys.     If you think it's because you are messy or will slop soup down your sweater, just order something really easy to eat.    If you are uncomfortable because you think he will think you are a pig, order a salad or something light ... or just eat what you want! Remember, most guys find it really sexy when women eat a decent meal.    If you have a real connection with this guy, your conversation alone will distract him from how or what you are eating.    If you really think you are gonna have a problem, start off slow. This time, maybe don't sit down at a restaurant for a meal. Instead, get takeout and drive somewhere with a great view. Get used to eating next to him before you try directly opposite him. Another idea would be to grab a hotdog and go for a walk while eating.    Once you feel more comfortable eating in his presence, then try eating at a table with him in a place you find comfortable (like your kitchen).    I guess what I am saying is take it slow and you'll adjust.    Good luck!|`|2Nu3sgZ2aa	take an intravenious drip with you.|`|QGuxbItCaa	You will be fine......when you grow up.|`|Or1FSQxKaa	Eat before you go...?|`|Zhfxd7PKaa	Become bulimic.    It's the only way . . .|`|UzvoQvB2aa	get over it guys think it's weird when girls don't eat in front of them just make sure to chew quietly and with your mouth closed|`|mHX3XaR7aa	Get a feeding tube inplanted.|`|AA11641349	Stop being so self conscious, eventually you're going to have to grow up an eat in front of them.  You can't spend the rest of your life avoiding it.  When you start dating steady, are you planning on never going to dinner with your guy?  Might as well start now.|`|zaMTz8z5aa	Be careful girl, because I think you are on the edge of an actual eating disorder.    eat when you are hungry and eat the food that tastes good and is healthy for you.    And don't worry about boys. They like a girl who eats and they don't like stick insects!!|`|FzFSzilmaa	eat before you go out...|`|5XhljcmCaa	stop being a baby and eat your dam salad who cares|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Put your food on his lap and then eat it.  People will think you are doing something else though, but who cares what they think?
nMWtEmEFaa	How to make it work?    To make it work out, you both need to have a future. If you do not have a future (such as getting married/moving in with each other) then you're setting yourself up for a failing relaitonship. LDRs only survive if both couples have a future to look forward to. So first establish your future with your partner before you engage in the long distance relationship.    The next would be communication, trust and working hard to make your relationship work.    If you got all of those down, then your LDR will just be fine. Remember to have a future, otherwise it's doomed to fail.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

It's the parents who are crazy for letting them move in.|`|zXheF7bUaa	men does it by theyre intelligence and charm  and if ur tough intelligence=if u are intelligent and have a good job and IS VERY RICH why would women leave u? charm=they couldnt resist a babyface tough=if u would leave ud smack her *** and **** her|`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't know too many women who would put up with that. Most would kick the guy out.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Sounds like you are a little jealous . Sure, the guy  is taking advantage of the girl and her family, but that is their problem, and you don't really know if he is in fact comfortable with the situation. He might be trying to find a position and just not letting people know of his non-sucess in that regard.

Il0QA1Hcaa	Parents and children have fights all the time, but remember they will always love you. The best thing to do is to get  your dad alone and tell him that you are sorry. Or you can pick him up a card to help break the ice and write a letter to go inside. He is hurting as well, so him not saying anything this morning was because he was feeling the same way|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Just talk to your parents and tell them you are really sorry.    We often, when angry, say things we regret later. Just talk to your mom and dad, tell them you want to apologize and I am sure everything will be just fine.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	I suggest you just approach both of your parents and sit down with them and discuss the fight and apologize for what what said I'm sure they feel the same way for whatever hurtful things they said to you. It's best to clear the air and discuss things calmly it will make all of you feel better I'm sure and discuss how you all can communicate more in the future so it doesn't happen again. Make the first move.|`|a0ba0de9b3a067f25fb66f9f3294881caa	When we are angry, we say alot of things we don't mean. Sit down with your parents and talk to them.

AA11344263	Here's the one thing you AT LEAST must do: continue school until you graduate. If you already have family problems, try to not screw things up even worse by dropping out. Just focus on your studies, and aim to graduate. It's great that you are thinking how to graduate, own health insurance, get a good-paying job and live on your own, but you have to also consider: where do you get all the money to do this from? If you do not have someone to financially support you, the only option is to turn to your family.    But I personally think your "family problem" is not very clearly defined here. If you mind explaining them in detail, then you would get better answers from people.|`|VZOisk2saa	if your telling us what not to say  im guessing you already know what you want to do so im not real sure why  your asking on here

jgU4g6kGaa	It is not alot to ask for this communication with the other girl to stop.  If he had any respect for your feelings he would understand where you are coming from and stop being so selfish.  If he is in a commited relationship with you he shouldn't be consoling and communicating with another woman especially someone he was involved with in the past. Would he approve if you were doing this to him? I would talk to him and tell him that it's not right and he needs to see this and let her go somewhere else for advise or whatever it is she needs from him he should be there for you and be concerned about making you happy if he is serious about you and making the relationship work.|`|de61a8ce1c1905694dcd685844ccfe27aa	Hi,  I do very well understand your situation.

D2g0XSLTaa	Dear Mom,  We are all looking forward to your visit on Friday and hope you have a wonderful vacation.  Our dream of having a large family with 6 kids is about to come true.  Yes, I am pregnant and due in May.  I thought it was better to share my joy with you now than to surprise you when you came out on Friday.    I sincerely hope that you will try to be happy for us and welcome a new grandchild into this world.      You may not approve and I understand and respect your concerns.  I am hoping that this visit will not be filled with arguments and disagreements.  Let's enjoy your visit.  The kids can't wait to see you.    Love always,  Your daughter xx|`|7CuotevFaa	Questions about relations and families are always short of Information.  For example we don't know why your mother hate your husband, you've been married for 12 wonderful years witch mean he's a good man, then you must be presenting him the wrong way to your mother.  And please talk to her it's not healthy for you or your children to keep avoiding your mother, rebuild the relationship between the two of you or it will have bad influence on your marriage : a man always look down to the woman when her parents aren't on her side.  As for the number of your children that's your own choice and no one can say else.But having 6 children in 13 year is not recommended in all civil societies it's not just your mother....but again it's your choice.    Wishing you the Best in your life.

If you and your husband want to have 10 kids it's none of her business. You and your husband are living on your own supporting your family and she has no business telling you how many kids you should have.  She isn't supporting them.  Just be frank with her and let her know that you love her but she needs to back off and be happy for you and your husband if she can't then you would rather she keep her comments to herself. Children are a beautiful thing.|`|w7V4tllHaa	First of all- CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU BOTH!!  Hey youve been married 12 years and got 5 kids and 1 on the way - in todays day and age- what an achievement!! YOU are far from being "a failure"!!!             Why not write to your mother explaining the positive things about your marrage and kids- unlike your mother who seems to have a NEGATIVE attitude on life and you ,your husband and your kids. Its time for you to stick-up to what you believe in YOUR family !!  THEY ARE YOUR LIFE-- Tell mother "like-it-or-lump-it !"                     good luck with your future xx|`|WDs4fRoxaa	Your mother has used he position to influence your life and   belittle you for far too long.    At one point you have to take that power away from her.    People can only do to you what you allow them to. (even relatives)    You are an adult, and it is time to act like one. Unless you plan  on living like this forever.    Dear Mom:    Just shooting you an email to tell you the good news. _______ and  I got our wish, we have baby number six on the way.    We wanted six children from the start, and it appears that our wish  will come true in May.    I would have told you sooner, but I know how you feel about me  giving you any more grandchildren.    Nonetheless, we are happy and hope that you will love this child as  much as you do the others.    See you when you get here.    __________      Best wishes|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	I would email her, give her the heads up. Your husband is right if you and him decided to have another child then that is up to you. If she starts to lecture you, just politly let her know that she is not raising the child and that you would prefer her to keep her comments to herself. She will probably not talk to you for a while, but she will come around. Once you stand up to her I think she will back off. But definitely tell her before she gets there or comments will fly before you can say anything.|`|nR0dxezGaa	Don't hide it from her. Its YOUR life, not hers. Deep down she probably has your best interest at heart and is concerned but you need to tell her that she needs to stop being so hard on you, if not then you might just have to cut her out of your life 100%. You do not need this stress right now, not for your baby or your family. If she cannot accept you and love you for who you are then is it really worth putting yourself through this? Life is too short to walk around on egg shells. I'm not promoting shunning her out of your life, but maybe set up ground rules where you will listen to what she has to say but if it gets to the point she's being too harst straight up tell her.."Mother, we are done having this conversation now. I know you love me but this is my life..."|`|QWaspeg7aa	I think there's a point in your life where you have to stop worrying about what your mother thinks of you. I know it's really hard because they're such a huge influence in your life but it is YOUR life and not hers. I think you should just ring her and tell her. If she wants to know why you haven't told her previously then say that you're an adult and you didn't want to have to justify to her why you were pregnant again. If she continues to criticize you then ignore her, and continue to ignore her until SHE comes round. This is her problem, not yours. You know if you have enough time in the day for another child. You know whether or not you consider yourself a failure. You know you have enough love for another child. It's really of no consequence to her at all, it just means she has another grandchild and if she's not willing to accept another grandchild then it's her loss. I bet she'd be horrified if she thought she would lose you and all her grandchildren, but if she carries on that's what will happen, unless you want to take her judgmental dominance forever. Your husband sounds like he will stand by you if you tell her so in the event of any negative fall-out you wouldn't be on your own. Just call her- you can't pretend she hasn't got another grandchild forever anyway, even if you do manage to hide being pregnant from her.
zRc4Swewaa	You have a family and children,you can't avoid getting a toxic in your family without involving the children.
crxbob5jaa	not my business.............    the two of you have to figure this one out.........and don't ever go back and say "everyone else thinks we should save the money and go to Barbados" if you are old enough to be getting married    solve the problem between the two of you|`|TjNMabEIaa	It depends on what you can afford really.  Barbados sounds lovely and you could upgrade to something a little more romantic than last time.  You could use the gift and work with the company to create something a little more special...a cottage instead of a hotel room...all inclusive...butler service etc.  A honeymoon will not be the same as a `holiday` but you both have to agree where you go.|`|AA11082914	What if you take the freebie right after the wedding, and then on your first anniversary take a 2nd honeymoon somewhere else?|`|LHdrMQc0aa	i think,.  take the holiday there as a family  then take your honeymoon some where new and exciting  i suggest  Alice Springs, Australia  Absolutley Amazing    Good Luck|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	No one in their right mind should get in the middle of this argument between you and your partner.  The two of you need to sit down, and make a couple of lists.  One, the finances of Barbados or somewhere else.  Two, the pros and cons other than finances.  Hopefully at some point, a winner will be clear to both of you.  I can see both the advantage of saving money, and going somewhere different to make it memorable.|`|evfsiU4Xaa	Make it a 2 week honeymoon =]    Take the first week in Barbados then get a flight to a nearby island as your 'somewhere new'.    Any excuse for more time in the sun =]|`|ZIVbFnOuaa	Save your money because with the economy like this you need all the money you can get|`|AA11961524	I think that you should take the barbados trip because you are currently building a house and getting married.Taking another trip may cost too much. You can always find different activities to do to make it more interesting and you will be experiencing it for the first time as a couple.    Good luck and congratulations.
6URBv5xfaa	hi  i feel sad for you, it is hard to believe that after having an affair for 11 years, in nine months of marriage your husband has beaten you, i suggest better you leave him and start your life afresh and please for godsake dont have a baby, coz it will only worsen things. any help you can message me  bye|`|AA11328507	While everyone else is being all "I'm so sorry for you" I have to be me and tell you that your a fool to stay any longer.  The man BEATs you!!!  The man has no respect for you and your still there?  Divorce him and move on.|`|pQNB5h8Taa	simple....leave him.|`|TL5iKwkSaa	hi mam.   i m not perfect enough to solve somebody's problem  after reading ur story i will suggest u 2 go to a gud lowyer without tell ing ur family. do what u want. do not pressureised.  try to be relax , do what u feel. dont take anyone's advice. in case of problem trust god. n take proper step after 10 times thinking. i will suggest u 2 leave him..   ajay.   u can mail me 2   tanha_feel_2006@yahoo.co.in|`|bIimm8fSaa	Honey, leave him.  I have problems with my in-laws.  They will not accept me.  He says it isn't me, it was always any one he was in a relationship with.  To prove to them that he loves me and chose me to spend his life with, he cut all ties with them for one year.  He has recently started going back to see them.  However, he has told them exactly how he feels and what he expects.  I chose not to have them in my life because of things they have done to me and my children.  He is 100% ok with that.  He understands.  And he tells me all the time, if it bothers me him going to visit them, he won't.  I say nothing because I know where his heart is.  I know if it came down to it, he would always chose me and stand up for me.  You cannot stay in an abusive relationship.  Get out while you can.  If he has hit you once, he will continue.  I wish you the very best.|`|muwVm3mAaa	If you feel that your Husband is not supporting you and loving you and you can't live with him, go to the court for a divorce.But before filing the divorce petition, think twice! Try to find some one who can really help you in this matter(may be any of your family friend)It will be a good option to take him to a hospital for Counseling.|`|gEJ4FgSXaa	1) Make a file and write the event of wrong thing that happened with you in past 9month. (how you met, and gradually how every thing took place )    2) Find a place for your self to live in before filing the case    3) Get the restraining orders and file the divorce case     4) Don't be gentle be strong ask for your share and don't go back at any cost or emotional blackmailing drag him to the court of law. Mental and physical torture both are bad... so dont worry about the proof just tell you story.
foq9TPjzaa	short and simple:    a friend who sticks by you through thick and thin.   once you hang out with them, you feel like you wanna blurt out every secret you have because you dont care what they think because you know they'll always support you :)|`|4034AK5Eaa	to me a best friend is someone that is always there for you and always willing to help or some1 u can tell ur darkest secret to.|`|AA11344263	A best friend is someone who is truly what they are to you. They are loyal, honest, good secret keepers and definitely never betraying. Be careful though, because a lot of people seem like they have these qualities but they do not. A best friend will listen in whatever condition you are going through and will give you an honest advice. A best friend will always stick with you no matter whatever you face comes.    Commonly, best friends have lots in common, but this doesn't apply to everyone. Sometimes best friends could be people with different interests, but still able to get along, because they respect each other. That's another best friend quality; respect. Best friends also love one another because they care about one another and has an individual will to help each other! :)|`|YDXITLv1aa	your closest friend. the one you get on with best and spend most your time with.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	in good times,and in bad times,he/she is on ur side forever more..|`|QvRnCtr7aa	a best friend is an Army friend.  civilian friends say they would take a bullet for you, but Army buddies really would.
GBr9YngTaa	Because both sexes do cheat.    So question if she cheats on you, why are you with her? Sorry she doesn't love you as much as she says she does. If she did, she wouldn't think of cheating on you. There's something that she's not satisfy with that she can get from someone else, or she knows she can get away with it because you let her and she keeps doing it.|`|et39TGIsaa	Aww, I'm sorry about that :(.  You deserve someone much better.  You are a human being and deserve respect and love, not this.    Both men and women cheat.  And there is NO excuse for it if you are in a committed relationship.    Get rid of that girl and find someone who will treat you with some respect, love you for you.  You deserve it.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	all sexes cheat but do i say|`|Udym0Wqqaa	Well, you're not the problem, she is. She clearly has issues commiting to just one guy, and if she does this repeatedly, maybe it's time to let her go. by the way, not everyone cheats.|`|YUMqQZBzaa	Obviously she isn't happy. Otherwise she would keep her pants on. Girls and guys cheat for the same reasons. They want something that is missing in their current relationship, or they don't care much about their relationship (or are even looking for an excuse for it to be over). Some people have a hard time being monogamous, thats fine, but those people shouldn't be in relationships that are supposed to be exclusive. Maybe if your girlfriend won't stop cheating you should let her go. You will both respect you more.|`|g5ShGjszaa	Girls often like to blame guys as a whole for some bad guys.  If someone is a rapist, they claim all guys are like that.  If someone cheats, again, they blame all guys.  It's just an immature way of letting anger out about a situation.  Man and **** that *****.  Move on to someone else.  Sorry bro.|`|1sHBVWuKaa	i beleave that woman cheat more it is hard to trust alot of woman the best thing i can say is kick her *** to the curb its not worth it|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	I like that you at least have tried talking to her about it.  So here's the deal:  she doesn't respect you enough to change.  It is a choice she is making and so you will have to ultimately make a choice---do you share her or move on to find someone who shares your concept of what a real relationship should be---and you are not a cheater, so you must find that same quality in another person.  Don't lower your standards and allow her to do this to you.|`|YVEeGlFbaa	If she cheats on you, then you should leave her. She either has some mental problems or she does not love you. Why is she still with you? Do you support her financially? Do you have something that she needs, in order for her to live her life? Like do you have money, a home, a car? Does she own or have anything? I don't know what her problem is, but she has issues. If she loves you, she should respect you and be with you and not sharing her private parts with anyone but you. She obviously has something wrong with her. A girlfriend will not hurt you if she loves you. Move on and be strong. Also, she cannot be happy with you, if she is looking for other men to please her. She has a void in her life and is seeking pleasure elsewhere. She is twisted and mentally messing with your head. Like, I said she must need therapy or she's just a dog. Why waste your time and life, when you could be exploring new positive experiences. Do you have kids? No? Then take advantage of what life can offer. Travel, have fun and meet other woman. Woman who will treat you like the man you are!
jgU4g6kGaa	Well that's definetely not a good thing.  Why would you do that anyway? There is always a way to work out disagreements and if you can't then it's best to walk away.  How are you going to feel if something bad happens to him?  Try and be more patient...be the bigger person and walk away from the situation.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	a yea that is a bad thing like hello|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	Very sad on your part.|`|QWaspeg7aa	It's not a great thing to have done to be honest with you. I think you should definitely go and apologize to him because if he has to go to hospital you'll feel really awful if you haven't even done that, and no-one should be punched or kicked anywhere by anyone for any reason ever so you really are the one in the wrong. If you can't apologize to him at least tell your mum or dad what you did so they can try and put things right, and also because they should know if you've done that so they can be aware in case of any problems he might have.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	take him to hosp before you attack him!|`|n8nhjmfraa	you are a ***** i hope you get hit by a school bus|`|D2sMKkchaa	Why do that?  He may of really annoyed you but you still don't do that!  Take him to the hospital god!  AND STOP BULLYING HIM!|`|11e186f736d5369cde4eaaf76595f3f7aa	If you have to ask this question on here, I believe that you have some problems that need to be worked on. I don't know how old you are, but if you can use Answers, you are old enough to know better. Take him to the doctor, and you should pay for the expenses.

Or your text got lost in cyber space and never made it to him? Just text - say hi how you doing? Keep it very simple and light  xx|`|AHY3UUIiaa	Maybe he didnt text back cos he's got no credit. If he waved the next day and didnt get chance to talk to you, He might of been able to tell you why he didnt text back. Don't jump to conclusions and think he doesnt like you cos maybe he does. Just take it slow dont text him i like you alot! That will just freak him out. Gradually just make conversation asking how he is then maybe ask to meet up one day and he may begin to like you if he doesnt already.    Good Luck.

tXlvg1ahaa	Make the foreplay last longer.  Make the foreplay longer by fingering her long before you enter her with your penis.  She must be on the brink of a climax before you get on.  Do not think that men have to do the whole job with his penis.  That is for the finale'|`|2hAuIg5baa	cock ring|`|2Nu3sgZ2aa	eat mash potato with peppered chocolate muffins.|`|FzFSzilmaa	slow down... take your time...|`|zVAIyOd7aa	Buy some pills that can make you have sex longer|`|AA11641349	Rub her back a little, maybe with a feather or.....if you really like to feel new sensations, a two pronged shrimp fork, it's great, sends shivers down the spine.|`|dzNnf3LHaa	I hear this all the time from my husband, but the truth is and I will tell you like I tell him, woman do not want to have sex for that long, unless this 30-35 mins includes foreplay.  It takes a woman about 10-15 mins of stimulation to have an orgasm.  If you have sex longer then that then she starts to dry out, and it gets painful for her.  I say 20-25 mins is longer then most men, and I have a feeling you're exagerating a little.  Ask her how she feels about this.|`|3eAfjLt3aa	just have ur gun empty before u meet her if u know what i mean...|`|ggKeBL7Laa	Masturburate Before having sex 4-5 Hours earlier and Change position  while having sex|`|MxZy5cOWaa	penetrate deeper and deeper....feel it....  and then look at these websites    in the beginning tease her more with oral/fingering:  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph...    spice it up with different sex positions:  http://www.sexinfo101.com/sp_index.shtml|`|14e9ef73980e3a2ab30467901f107e04aa	20-25 mins is long enough...as long as both partners climax.|`|wHDZkpqoaa	pace yourself take your time to enjoy evertthing or think of something like a problem in your head so that your not focusing all on the sex|`|EznusGeQaa	i think its long enuf...bt if u want more of it,keep changing positions...  or everytime u think ur gonna *** then slow down..|`|184inSdGaa	durex tingle lube...  it gives you abit of a cold sensation that can help you, she'l like it too :p  also get her to go down on you first, as thats more intense than sex and might be able to help you ... it kinda sounds like it wouldnt help but it might....   but to be honest why do u want to make it last longer? if u both enjoy it dont try and change what ur doin your obviosly doin it right!  x

Leave  he just wants your help in paying for things, He knows how you feel  and he's taken advantage of your love, move on Honey
PRJfZAWBaa	Initially you cannot trust anyone unless you build your trust on them by being in contact for a considerable amount of time.    I had been skeptical of giving my info to my contacts before, but now, over a period of time and being in constant touch with them, I know them well enough to trust them.     I assume, you too have a good set of contacts and I can assure you that our mutual contacts are 100% trustworthy!!  :-)|`|wz8gx3gaaa	It is ver dangerous to blindly believe in on-line friends.

Sadly, there's an awful lot of people online willing to parade fake personas for the purpose of luring others.

tXlvg1ahaa	My grandma always told us this trick they used to do on men in the old days when she was a teenager.    First of all, the girl must go commando on the day that she plans her action.  Once she has his attention, she must squat on one knee as if to tie a shoe lace, and allow him to "accidentally" see that she is going commando.  She must not let him look for long enough that he can actually see clearly, but keep him guessing if he had seen what he had actually seen.  She says that this uncertainty sparks a man's interest and keeps them pursuing the girl until she gives in.|`|fa37a0de0a5be40d26be97dc0e9e16b8aa	just talk to him about it  and say that you regret it whats the worst that can happen, he says he doesn't like you, then you won't spend time dancing around the subject and you can spend time getting over him.

I am giving you permission to get married on a tropical beach and only invite immediate family.  (Isn't that so nice of me?)    As for getting married in a tropical location; contact a travel agent and ask for suggestions.  She'll help you find a gorgeous place and will help you establish the local connections that you need to accomplish what you need.

She offered fantasies I had only dreamed of, but karma lets me know that no matter what this is the wrong answer. If I had gone to her. Even for a evening, it would have led my marriage down a path that is hard to ever recover from. Instead I went home talked to my wife and told her what happened and what I had responded with and as a result our marriage is stronger and she put aside some of her inhibitions to experiment with my fantasies. And that is why I love her so. I don't know if what I have said helps at all but its just my life experience and I think thats what we are all here to get. Perspective, that is.|`|gSwobfujaa	i was never with a married man, so technically i was not a mistress. however, at one sad point in my life i did allow myself to be second best, or the other woman. there is a little bit of a story to it. i started dating this guy who seemed to be wonderful. i really fell for him, really fast. he knew just what to say, when to say it and how to say it. it seemed like he was perfect. then, one day, i didnt hear from him. and then the next day i didnt hear from him. i finally called and left him a message saying that everything had seemed great and i didnt understand what was going on. he called me back almost immediately and said that he met another woman around the same time he met me and one night when they were out she asked him to commit to her and he had said yes somewhat against his better judgement. i was really upset. he then told me he was going to tell her he made a mistake bc he said he really liked me and wanted to pursue something with me. when he invited me to hang with him a few days later i guess i had assumed thats what he did. well...i shouldnt have assumed. i found out that he was still with her. at this point i was sucked in and extremely naive and vulnerable. at that point in my life i didnt have the balls to say "screw you im over this" and i wish i did. it lasted quite some time. his promises were that we were gona be together officially soon and that he didnt want to be with her. that he doesnt have fun with her, etc and the whole shabang.     funny thing happened. one day i was at work and a random man came inside and immediately came to me. i know this is gona sound weird but he claimed to be a psychic. i laughed and played along bein a smart a**. well he began to tell me my life situation which included some things no one knows about me at all. and then he told me about this guy i had fallen for. he knew so much about our situation it was frightening--well he knew all of it to be exact. he told me that this man truly did love me in his heart and wanted to be with me. that he didnt like his current relationship but that he wouldnt be getting out of it any time soon. he knew that i hadnt talked to him in about a week and that he was going to be calling me the next morning to hang out. and it would be an important day for me. i was in shock...shaking and amazed by what he was telling me. he actually did call me the next morning to hang out and i went over. he told me again that he wished he could be with me but he doesnt know what to do. it was then and there i realized i couldnt be that person anymore and my heart couldnt take it any longer. i had the closure i needed which was knowing he actually did hold a place for me in his heart. what broke the deal was simple that i was second best to him bc he wouldnt commit to me. and that was the last day i have seen him. its been 3 years since then. he still contacts me via email every now and then but thats it.    since then i have found a wonderful man who loves me and puts me first. this guy truly is my hero. so that day with the other guy was an important day for me. i grew up and did the right thing for myself. oh and not to mention-the psychic told me i would find my true love in 2007. strange huh?    :-)|`|02db2fc0115ea3b94253e8474b9c5015aa	Well, I was not Mistress but I came close to doing so.   He did say, I would be in his life and always in his heart.   The thing was I was not the one he wanted to be with.    After 3 years, he stopped talking to me. I wish he cared,   and would talk to me. Its sad when you can`t be friends.   I was his high school sweetheart, and found him after 23.   So I am sad about not being in his life.|`|Q2MLikeUaa	no never thank goodness|`|hREcQqwGaa	if  I wanted to be the rebound girl, i would dig my own grave and sleep in it... thats how bad women or men are who have affairs with MARRIED men and women.... idiotic and pathetic....|`|98154758777a4e64556f587f3efee74baa	Once, a long time ago. When I was young and stupid.     First of all, I didn't know he was married for at least a year. I used to think people were full of it when they gave the excuse "I didn't know." I learned the hard way, it IS possible. He promised he loved me and we would spend the rest of our lives together. After I found out about his wife. I completely cut him off, I was so disgusted. But after awhile he begged me to come back. He assured me he was getting a divorce, that he was miserable with her, and he was miserable without me in his life. Even though I still had feelings for him, I realized that this was nothing more than a game to him. I was a little wiser the second time around and told him to go f*ck himself.    Even though this was many years ago and I am now happily married, that jackass STILL tries to contact me. "I just want us to be friends." What a loser....|`|hitKzYhBaa	For a long time now. There was a strong attraction in the beginning  and 12 years down the line it still remains. There were no promises  at all. They see each other when they can and keep in contact. They  know each others family's. She has even stayed at the sisters house  with him and her children while the wife and his children were in a  different state. Its not about deception. Its not even about wanting to  break up a marriage. They are really in love but have learned to make  it work. The strange thing about it is. Every one in his family know  they have been together for years and even drop him off at her house  but the wife has never found out.|`|2NUJsWIoaa	My husband promised his mistress(es) that they were THE ONE!! None of them knew of the others. LATER They found it hard to imagine how he was managing time for all of them!!    When I first found out and left him he came begging for forgiveness and now 2 yrs later we are really close! He tells me about the disgusting spots on one their backs and the disgusting looking thing on the other ones *****!!!    I feel quite sorry for them when he talks of them with such disrespect. Can't understand why somebody would agree to live off the wife's crumbs!
77FNePxFaa	Well, I think you should tell her what the problem is. Tell her exactly what you just posted.  A lot of time we make situations worse by not talking and being honest with each other. If you tell her you are unhappy with your sex life and are fantasizing about other woman I am positive unless she isn't happy with you she will step it up!|`|icTmbLjfaa	If you want to play around, play around. Dont lead a woman on to think that you love her if you are actually thinking of being with someone else. It's better to hurt ppl with the truth than with lies and deceit.|`|PnMtlZ0Yaa	She's doing fine with me... Wait. I wasn't supposed to tell you.|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	maybe do it less|`|teisU4E2aa	do u give her oral? try being romantic chicks love that stuff. like candles and rose peddels on the bedroom floor and the bed|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Maybe you should stimulate her desire to give her oral sex by giving her a bit more foreplay..  ie. back massages, gentle touches, spending time with her, brushing / washing her hair , touching erotically and oral sex. Maybe then she will return the favor. It can't be one sided.|`|AA11899313	You have no commitment to the relationship ~ and I get the impression of a great vacuum around you ~ there is no-one really touching (emotionally) anyone .....there is no 'meaning' to the relationship beyond maybe a certain convenience.    Why are you still there?    Sash.|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe she is bored with you too...    and she is thinking of playing around...    try talking about what you can do to change things...|`|NVUngN45aa	we book into a hotel for the night as often as poss and immediately jump in the shower together....that might get you going. or you could start taking sexy pics of yourself and email them to her.|`|eLhWgghwaa	Talk to her about it.    Sex isn't the be all and end all. If you loved her then you wouldn't even be tempted to 'play around'.    Maybe there is a reason she isn't interested.|`|aoa4jCjdaa	you want to play around!! oh my god.    go and drag your women dump here in the car - go somewhere - do it then come home.    that will excite things up a lil|`|jNQbVDHSaa	try doing the oral on her, prolong foreplay and create an ambience in room b4 u start.|`|kgUzdfqVaa	Stick with it if you still love her!  After a while sex may become less spontanious, you may stop thinking about wanting your partner as much, but the spark may still be there if you are willing to work at it a bit more than before.  You should not be thinking about cheating on this girl because of the sex. Is sex the most important aspect of your relationship? I hope not.  Spend some time with her, treat her to a romantic meal, take things slow and don't put too much pressure on her, or yourself.  It's normal to have periods where one or both of you aren't too in to sex during a long-term relationship. Just enjoy each other's company, and lookforward to the next peak!|`|8EsicBxUaa	Instead of asking us, ask her  I am sure if she is unhappy she will tell you    If you want to have sex with someone else because she is not giving you it, you cant be in a good relationship  Yes, sex is nice but it is not the most important thing in a relationship    Ask her why, maybe there is a reasonable explanation..|`|IcfoAI3naa	Oral sex, then that's the problem your more into the sex then into her   who wants to kiss a girl after doing a thing like that, she likes you but I think she wants to leave you because you care more about the sex then her as a person, but she is confused because she's not sure if she will find someone else she just doesn't have the confidence in her self yet, But she will if you don't change your ways, sex is not everything, try loving her for her not just sex, and if you really loved her you wouldn't be thinking about playing around on her just because of sex, Just maybe you should seek a little help.  Good luck and may God be with you.|`|de61a8ce1c1905694dcd685844ccfe27aa	U cant take up the topic to her and ask what is the reason for it. If there is something wrong in u, u can change for her.  try somethin new and exciting which drives her. But first of all talk to her as what is holding her back.  God Bless!|`|GBXvJ5mjaa	Communicate with her. Be completely open and honest, and maybe she will give you some oral. But if that doesn't do it and you are leaning towards infidelity, then see if maybe she would be interested to play in a threesome with some close open friends. If not, then consider dumping her, and finding someone else. Really no point to what the drama of being unfaithful can bring. While being with someone isn't ALL about sex, sex is usually the thing that can destroy love, so if you're not happy, then you're not happy. Simple as that.
xpu4XgPXaa	Stick with your idea because you have obviously thought about it and its your own idea : ) xxxx|`|b8VNVGTqaa	get her a rose or a pink teddy thats got "i love u" writen on it a kiss to and some spare rim to *** her (hehe:)|`|OyP8yLhjaa	you should give her flowers, candys, or take for dinner|`|BJwhdvjoaa	Chocolate is foreplay skip the treats go right for the roses and chocolate that way she gets the best of both.|`|UJ6D0Wm5aa	I agree with the necklace but I think it should be a pearl necklace|`|YVEeGlFbaa	make her a small cake or cookies. give her a homemade card and if you have a picture of the both of you--glue it to it...and an beautiful flower.|`|XR9XK7FXaa	Give your girlfriend a nice necklace and roses (chocolates)  Get Her Friends chocolates to but make sure theirs is not better than hers|`|fDhOFwX9aa	Teddy bear..|`|fv1Eh5Geaa	banana|`|cUgtkGdVaa	one of her favorite flowers and a chocolate.

p6QizgmRaa	Certainly not me!|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Marriage was come about through covenant between God woman and man. The Old Testament covers that as was explained already, so the bible is the foundation of marriage.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The inventor of marriage was Al Gore.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	I think it was a money hungry dumb blonde way back in the day|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Many cultures "invented" marriage thousands of years before Christianity.  For the most part marriage is considered a "contract" of such and was hardly "for love" (it was a business transaction).    Courtly love (romance) that what the western world now considers the basis of marriage happened around 12th century (medieval times) and for the Christians amongst us the notion of marriage as a sacrament and not just a contract can be traced St. Paul who compared the relationship of a husband and wife to that of Christ and his church (Eph. v, 23-32).|`|lvelp0CGaa	The uniting of families has gone on for centuries where 2 father's would meet and decide if they're children uniting would benefit the families wealth . This usually involved cattle / sheep / pigs / beads / hand woven blankets so on and so forth .    The idealism of marriage was brought in around the 1800's after the son of God apparently walked amongst us and died for our sin's ( which may I remind society we are STILL committing ) , the church brought through the union of holy matrimony before the eyes of god as a way to bring funds into their congregation and to build larger worshipping places for people to attend in large groups to pay the churches tithes as a way to cleanse their soul and bribe st Peter at the golden gates that apparently lead to heaven .    It has been carried on by the governments and private marriage celebrants as a way to make extra money .    Its all a farce marriage is about love committment loyalty honesty trust not religion and not about some government .|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Well, not sure exactly who it was but I know for sure it was a woman...a very crafty woman.|`|bIimm8fSaa	If this answer isn't the truth, then I have no clue who the dumb a$$ was!      According to the Bible, God himself began the marriage arrangement in the Garden of Eden, when he married Adam and Eve.     We read at Genesis 2:22-24: "Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man [Adam] into a woman and to bring her to the man. Then the man said: 'This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, because from man this one was taken.' That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh." God himself brought Eve to Adam. They didn't just decide to live together without a legal basis for doing so. We also see the permanance of this union, and the fact that God emphasised that they were to stick together.     God's actions of bringing Eve to her husband established and sanctioned the arrangement for future generations to follow.
ggKeBL7Laa	wtf are you talking about what would you do if you see your BF with another girl fool !|`|fa37a0de0a5be40d26be97dc0e9e16b8aa	that guy is bad news not every guy is like that some just don;t know how to deal... im sorry but he'll get over it|`|eqaUMrYZaa	Pay more attention in school , what the hell did you just try to say ? Are you Asian ?|`|0oDbTWQ8aa	um its natural he still has feelings for you .     i hate seeing anyone i love or like with another girl it just kills and annoys me to hell. . its natural.     im sure your like that too..|`|XR9XK7FXaa	the reason why your ex is doing that is because he still likes you, i did that after he and my girl split. you just have to tell your boyfriend that nothing happened try to explain. Then Tell your ex that you well never get back with him. (unless you want to go with him)|`|dbCkTKDxaa	because they don't like it. they think you theres and don't want anther man with you|`|fDhOFwX9aa	You shouldn't bother much about why he did that to you. It' obviously he is jealous. The most important thing now is to avoid ur relationship being destroyed by him. Tell ur man (current BF) that what you need the most is trust and give u some time to prove the truth and say sorry also for everything, you had argue with him bcoz u love him. Both of you must trust each other in time like this. And don't let him spoil ur relationship with ur man. Prove to ur ex that he can never spoil ur relationship with that. Then I think he will stop.
QAQTYuIjaa	yes, because i have this stupid problem i don't understand and i gotta do it for homework or the teacher is gonna take points off of my already low average.|`|icTmbLjfaa	Yes because I am alone and I dont have any friends or a man that loves me :( (Debby Downer, WAH WAH lol)|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I am happy right now.

We had to travel for an hour or so too so it was a good airing of my brain.  Sometimes where your sad the best uplifting is to take a ride in the country, meditate in a garden, look into the sky and just smile!|`|HfVTk1zBaa	i never feel sad|`|1QRLr6Caaa	Really sad because I want have one or two pegs, but my wife (who was suppose to go to market) is not moving hence very sad situation.............by the way good news she has gone and will be back by ten minutes I am happy that I can finish two pegs within ten minutes so I am happy now!!|`|JTqiOaFcaa	no.but m bore|`|HoKOAN7oaa	yes. my first love's  memory. i can't get it out.|`|G7sANdhFaa	no|`|S0CTSAJ2aa	Nooooooooooooooo|`|zaMTz8z5aa	I was sad a few weeks ago because my dad was very sick in hospital. I thought he might die.  He is not working and we are really broke and the holidays were boring because mum had to work every day and dad was too sick to take us anywhere.    But none of that matters anymore and I don't think i will ever be sad again...  because the doctor told us that my dad is going to get better. He is not in danger. So now we are poor and we still can't do anything and mum is still working too hard. But  MY DAD IS GOING TO BE OK!!!      And I am the HAPPIEST girl in the world!!|`|rF1fpyenaa	Yes.

IplmS6ACaa	Your speech should combine a blend of genuine warmth and sincerity along with a few jokes or funny stories. You should compliment the Bride, mention your friendship with the Groom and how honored you are to be his Best Man.    It is not a good idea to drink before you speak and dont use any vulgar language as you speak. I found these two sites excellent, hopefully you will too:    http://www.speechsuccess.com/best-man-sp...  http://www.bestmanhelp.com/|`|Vhq3GURQaa	When everyone is facing the minister, you will be to the right of the groom.Maybe a step behind.|`|Wy7oZGvZaa	say something serious but make a few jokes|`|0bc986861c0e5afae15d606bc6b9fbc4aa	There are some good short books on the subject, in the library.|`|Auy58DUtaa	In true internet style, there are a number of best man speech ideas web sites (see references), but for my two pennyworth ----      I was my brother's best man, but it was 39 years ago. It is a nightmare to try and be funny but not offensive. It takes a lot of research, but as brothers you should have a lot of material. If you are competitive, you could say that "after all the fights (or football matches) we had as a kid, it is good to hear that my brother has at last admitted that I am the best man." If your family is not too prudish, I'd also say "when I knew I had to give the best man speech, I spoke to a few friends (or went onto the internet) and asked how long my speech should be. They said 'about as long as it takes the groom to make love'. I'd better not be too much longer then."      I have done dozens of speeches and presentations and my ideas are:    i) If you are not happy improvising, then write everything you want to say down, preferably on small index cards linked with a staple or a punch hole and a tag, so that it is easier to turn the pages and if they drop they still remain in order.     ii) If you are able to improvise, just write down the topics on card or paper, as it makes it easier to look at the audience while delivering the speech.     iii) Rehearse in front of a mirror to the point where you almost have learnt what you want to say. I know you look like a prat, but the more you practice, the more comfortable you will be and the better it will go.     iv) Remember the reason for the speech. You are there not just to take the mickey out of the groom. You need to do the formal things. Start by thanking the bride and groom on behalf of the bridesmaids (and page boys and matron of honour if appropriate) for allowing them to a special part of this extra special day and finish with the toast to the health and happiness of the bride and groom.|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	For me, I had my best man give a speech also.  Me and my wife had a Catholic wedding, not to worry, the priest or minister will explain everything to you before the actual day, so no need to worry, it all gets looked after and explained to you.  For speech time, my best man shocked me.  He gave a serious, but yet kinda of funny speech.  He made me spit my wine out when he said, "I am so very honored to be here and I was twice as happy as I am now when I was told by the groom that I could be the best man on his next wedding if I did a good job here, whoops, was not supposed to say that".  You could say something funny like that.  Check with your family members first if it is appropriate, depends on the personality of the groom and bride when you give a speech and how you write a speech.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|JPeLzMoPaa	Being the "Best Man" is a great honor. The groom wants you to stand right next to him during one of the most important events in his life. He will turn to you and hold out his hand when prompted for the ring. Just hand it to him and DON'T DROP IT. Nothing worse when the ring is dropped and goes rolling somewhere.    As far as the speech, that is made during the reception. Normally you propose a toast. Since you are his brother, tell people about leading up to this event, how proud you are of them both, How you wish they both remain as happy as they are right now. Welcome her to the family and wish them long life, health and happiness. Cheers  Oh yeah, The best man also plans the bachelor party!! Good luck and congrats to your brother and his new bride-to-be.  Here's a really good site to check out.  http://www.yourweddingstory.net/The%20be...

Then tell your so called friend to get lost, because like the old adage goes with friends like that you don't need enemies.
QvRnCtr7aa	invite your friend over to watch cartoons.  that works.|`|domEftoIaa	every once in a while you should go with them. but if you continue to do it then your friends are gonna think that you are mooching off them, by getting them to drive you home. why don't you get them to come over to your house and hang out once in a while.
QvRnCtr7aa	hes a guy... guys are simple. tell him "listen, you feel like you got duped, but my information is wrong for a reason.  last thing i need is some creepy guy stalking me.  if you wanna throw away a good friendship over some dumbass ****, fine."|`|domEftoIaa	you need to just give him a few days to cool off and then you should approach him with the truth. if he still doesnt listen then you just need to move on to someone else. good luck!!!
tXlvg1ahaa	Go down to Sandy Bay where the swimmers all go nude.

PQXeykoZaa	someone like this is considered eye candy......  http://i555.photobucket.com/albums/jj477...|`|PSWFAVthaa	If your asking the definition of eye candy, its someone who is very good looking and 'nice to look at'.     If your asking how you can be 'nice to look at' then thats a bigger question. Eat healthy, work out, be hygenic, dont wear too much makeup (if your a girl), be nice natured...|`|nkxE1DGMaa	is a person that is very attractive   good lookin|`|CbYw3jFZaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, that is so true!|`|ljyuS5Ubaa	the beholder|`|QvRnCtr7aa	someone who can command the attention of others.  the way they move and present themselves.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	Something you personally find physically attractive in someone!     As in He/She is sooo good to look at, you just want to stare all day long :D|`|GBr9YngTaa	Attractive physically is most likely what makes someone an "eye candy".    However,  if you have somehow grab the person's attention by your personality you can also become their eye candy. Meaning that they're flashing you looks.|`|gj2IEXk7aa	big titties!
AA11706291	Well if it makes you feel any better the unfeeling cow he's seeing now will probably get the same treatment as you and he will never be happy.    Where as you will meet a guy who will treat you right, love you until the stars fall out of the sky and will do anything just to see you smile.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Well its guys like this that give all guys a bad name.  its quite obvious this guys a dog and you need to kick him to the curb.    You need to realize you have just been a piece of meat to the guy.  im so sorry to be so blunt and I usually dont condone walking away from a relationship but this guy really seems like low life scum.    Im going to tell you what I tell so many people that ask similiar questions.    I want you to take 10 minutes completely to yourself with no interuptions.  I want you to look in the mirror the entire time and imagine your life 10 years from now.  Be serious when yo do it.  i think you may realize you have no room in your life for this sort of stuff.    You can read some great relationship stories below that will most ceartainly help you on your journey.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Avoid him like a disease.  Cut all, I mean ALL, contact from this guy immediately. Call the cops on him if he harasses you.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Lucky you found out before you got pregnant again. Never see him again.|`|XL1evQBRaa	i'd kick him out of my life SO FAST it would make his headspin!    You deserve better! a HELL of alot better.    Men like that don't deserve anything, and funnily enough, it will all bounce back to them eventually!      There are so many men out there, who want a relationship i'm sure you're after too. He is just a spanner in the works, and as soon as you can rid of him, the sooner you can start moving forward.    All the best|`|zdpp7cubaa	If he left you while pregnant, you should have never taken him back in the first place because he is a sorry excuse for a human being, if he would leave a pregnant woman alone and scared. As for the other woman, why would she care? She probably knew from the beginning that he and you were together. Don't feel like a fool, you were just someone who was taken advantage of. Just move on with your life and take care of you and your son.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I think you should end it and leave it that way.  If he can't even man up and marry you - where is his commitment going to be when it comes to kids?  If he hasn't sealed the deal after 7 years - it's time to move on...unless you want to live like this for the rest of your life...|`|M4ueGu0Baa	oh gosh. that's absoutly terrible!  but what are you asking?   if i were you, i would dump the guy.|`|HMW3EoTWaa	People just suck.  There's really nothing I can do for you except tell you I'm sorry you had to be the victim of something that happens all too often.  Keep your head up, because there's still honest, caring people out there, like you and I.|`|y07MGbLcaa	kill him|`|AA10010935	Stay broken up, this guy doesn't deserve you.   If he cheated on you once he will do it again.  Rid yourself of people like that fiancee of yours and his co-worker, move on and start fresh,|`|d89qNyb6aa	You are worth so much more than this man can see.  Please don't have anything to do with him again.If he contacts you,stay calm and really nice and polite.If you're horrible to him,it just makes it easier for him to hate you.If you're nice to him,he will hate himself for letting you go.    I can't see his new relationship lasting long, and even if it does,there will NEVER be trust there because his new girl will always be wondering if he's cheating on her like he cheated on you WITH her.    Take some time out from relationships and make time for YOU!!    I' m so sorry you're going through all this but you WILL get through it all and when you come out the other side,you'll be glad you didn't take the rat of a man back who did this to you.    You're no fool.....you fell in love...that's all.    ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((HUGS))))...|`|QCtJJ04Uaa	You need to get rid of this loser!!!     This guy is shameless and obviously not trustworthy. He's deceived you more than once and that is MORE than enough reason to get him out of your life for good, for you AND your son's sake. Thank god you didn't end up marrying him! I know its hurting you real bad right now, but this is a blessing in disguise. You dodged a bullet sweetie. Can you imagine the long, drawn out (not to mention expensive) process of trying to file for a divorce?     It might be best for you to go back into counseling to deal with your emotions. You need to focus on taking care of yourself right now so that you can come out of this stronger than ever.     And if that colleague of his still wants to see that slimeball ex-fiancee of yours, well then she deserves him and everything he might put her through.     Don't you worry about the two of them...they will get whats coming to them. Stay strong hun!|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	The only thing a BAD man does; is keep a GOOD man away. Discover your true self worth and leave him behind. Your anger and pain is justifiable and normal; although don't be tempted to take revenge. You will be spending energy on a man not worth the effort. Love yourself and only accept what you deserve. A man who cheats does not cherish or respect what he has. Good luck.|`|RRo1la66aa	finacee for 7 years...get married!    baby... hmm...    left you? no good.|`|AA12302427	He is the fool not you, you seem to have tried to do the right thing all along for everyone.  Sounds like they deserve each other, just remember what goes around comes around!  Get on with your life without him, be strong and be well, look after your son and be happy.|`|ExKUxTfSaa	they are both undeserving low lifes.  I know it wil be a painful process but you WILL find someone better.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Run away and let them be its her problem now!|`|GwwsJzSMaa	Swollow your pride and try to put him from your mind, it will be hard at 1st but will get better with time. I would not contact him or the woman again, ever. Delete every contact you have for them, then you cannot get in touch if you fall soft. By being silent and ignoring them will give you a bit of dignity that you so need, back. Revenge isnt sweet. Unfortunately in this world they are people like them and people like us, lift yourself up for you and your child and make a life for yourselves. Sod them. Good Luck honey, it can be done.|`|LYdl0Wplaa	He is not the guy for you. The first time he left was your biggest sign of what was to come. He is not worth you tears. Remember the saying, what goes around comes around. In a case like this, It's going to come 10 times worse for him. Give it some time and you'll find someone better. You deserve so much better, and never think otherwise. You deserve to be treated with respect and like the queen that you are. You need someone who cares about you as much as himself. This guy only cared about himself. Be glad you're not with him. Be glad you don't have a child with him. In the end, I think you would be so much more hurt then you are now. So hold your head up high. The right guy for you is out there. It's only a matter of time before you find him, or he finds you.|`|S2ZccVFAaa	I'm going to recommend a book, you don't have to read it but it helped me quite a bit. Telling yourself the truth by Backus and Chapian. Another good one is the Bondage Breaker by Anderson.     I can understand that you are hurt and angry, and you have every right to be. It is in our very nature to be hurt in situations like these. What you need to do is to make sure all of your hurts get healed. Do yourself a favor and ERASE him out of your contacts in your phone. You're not doing yourself any favors by keeping him around all the time.     He has shown you that he is uncaring and undependable. He has left you at least two times and has cheated on you at least once. Do NOT go back to you, if they cheat once they will more than likely cheat again.     Don't let others tell you what you are or are not worth. You have so much to live for! Take all of those bad memories and replace them with you screaming at him what a clod he is. If it takes "rewriting" the memories dozens of times then do it. Do it until you feel like you have won the  battle.    Remember no matter what happens that YOUR Heavenly Father is always there.     Jeremiah 29:11  John 3:16-17|`|yCiMKk9haa	Oh my word - I just read your question - poor you.  He sounds like a bad piece of work and I would get him out of your life.  I know it sounds hard as your probably have loved him, but he cannot treat you like this - you have obvioulsy been through a great deal; it sounds as though sticking with him is going to make things worse for you again.    I know it sounds superficail, but really - give it time, the pain will get less I promise and you may even meet soemone who treats you as you should be treated (even if you dont its not the end of the world you still have your son who you cherish).  You will, in time, think that getting rid of him was the best thing you ever did - take heart in the fact that he will probably do the same thing over and over - he is obvioulsy an imature man and quite frankly doesnt deserve your love.    Big hugs to you!!

uzXwM0Qzaa	Good you are a virgin and you got saved from marrying with this type of woman. If she's engaged with you, it means she must know that she is having a marital future with you and despite of that she's seeing her ex and she's got the guts to contradict the fact by saying WHAT THE BIG DEAL. She must be joking dude, good you left her.    And where virginity is concerned, it is your choice to marry a virgin girls because you preserved your virginity till 25, and I think you do deserve a virgin.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Would you purchase a car without first test driving it???    Marriage, as you will find out, is less important than test  driving a car.    Now, we both you know think I am being s smart     but eventually you too, when standing in front of the divorce judge,  I will be on the floor LOL|`|87d4tt6Raa	Good for you for waiting till your married. Its wierd where our worlds at. I mean, pep bash you for waiting till your married to have sex, but yet pep who go around sleeping with everyone are on top  of the world??? I honestly think its best to wait till you married as well.|`|e97047f84cabb9eb199ebb6f74ba94d5aa	Stick with your beliefs and don't worry about what other people think.  It is better though not to judge people.  We all do things and wish we hadn't later.  God forgives us of everything and we should too.  If thats important to you then stick with it but, you might be missing out on a great woman to share your life with.|`|YFlGfj6daa	You're upset she still sees a boyfriend from when she was 15???    And if you knew she wasn't a virgin after a "couple of dates", why did you get engaged to her if it's so important to you that she be a virgin?|`|abTZX46faa	I think it's alright, if you weren't a virgin and wanted to marry one, it would be totally different. But if you've been patient, then I wouldn't hold it against you to expect the same from your partner. Although, you may have difficulty finding one.|`|U3KXaMRvaa	Whoa man... 25? You've got a real load of patience I salute and appreciate... you're a pure man. Purer than many others. Only women need to understand this. But man... you live in a society where you can't find virgin women of your age walking in the street and come up to you. Man... maybe you want to have some patience and compromise! Almost all women up till this age may have lost their virginity.|`|Whic1hd6aa	I don't know why some women detest a guy who wants to marry a virgin woman.But I do think that happened for the best,because if you would've ended up marrying her,then that would've been a mess.    You'll find a woman who has the same morals and values as you,and fall into real love.    The other woman just needed to raise her standards.
ejrVotg8aa	Somewhat, it loosens people up. Drops their inhibitions and makes them more outgoing. That can be a good thing but it can also be a very bad thing.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think it gives ppl the ability to be more outgoing, talkative and "fun".  Of course a lot of times it's only those who are drinking that see drinkers as fun...sober ppl tend to think they look foolish lol|`|XL1evQBRaa	yes. with most people.    I used to drink before i went out, then carry on the drink while i was out.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Sometimes it depends who you sre and if doing that relaxes you|`|Ch23rNeqaa	I think no.  Some they could do this.  But the majority do to forget problems.  I think is it!  =*|`|qa24GAqNaa	I don't but i know a lot o/ people who do...(itz high school) They do tend 2 come out o/ the shell. Or they drink from depression (i normally don't understand that part)|`|dj8ofPtgaa	Alcohol is a depressant so after all the sha-zaam you may feel relaxed, but that depends on the person. And coming out of the shell on alcohol may not be  good thing

It got to the point where I'd turn it down when we arrived at the school, lol.|`|tmUIYXlIaa	I remember it was early winter, and my step-brother and I were late getting out to the bus.  We rushed out without our winter coats on and made it onto the bus.  My dad, realizing we didn't have our coats, met the bus at a crossroad on the route and pulled us both off - just to give us the coats.  We weren't let back on either - he took us both to school and gave us a scolding.  Today, I can appreciate what he did in term of taking time out of what he was doing to take care of us.  It was embarassing, but it certainly stressed the importance of making sure we made more time in the morning and prepared ourselves better for the day.  I know now that experience couns for something and that then he was right, and now I am tasked with doing what's righ for my son - even if it's embarassing.
3Wq3MHy3aa	He sounds insecure and overly possessive. Often those who accuse of cheating are the ones thinking about doing it themselves. His behavior isn't going to get better. I have dated someone like this and it's best to end it if you are unhappy.|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	It's really good what he is doing. He loves you a lot and wants you to be with him always. Why do you guys, break up for every petty matters?|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	He is controlling and very insecure in himself. This is why he thinks you are seeing other men. He will not change easily so I would suggest you get out of this relationship before it goes any further.  He will make you miserable.|`|AHY3UUIiaa	Hes sounds insecure and possesive. Which is good it shows he cares for you. My boyfriend is exaclty the same. Sometimes it drives me round the bend cos im not that kind of girl either. If it gets a little bit to much for you i would suggest sitting down and talking. Either say stop thinking im cheating or you know where the door is. His choice.    Take care,  AJ.Xx|`|BuctVReEaa	The bloke is a control freak/psycho and is trying to reduce your self-esteem to nil so that he can control you. If you value your mental health and happiness then please dump him now. You will realise this every time he tries to make you feel guilty when you have done nothing wrong, that is the main symptom. I repeat dump him darling you cannot help him, only he can change his behaviour, but you do not have to choose this suffering.|`|rfGgMitkaa	in no time..he would be deciding for you which friends to keep ..and later on he would be telling you aweful things about your appearance and then apologize..he would check after you on your mobile and mails and and and..one day he will slap you..then apologize..and promise never to do it again..you will for some reason..trust him over and over again..u will get more attached to him..you will waste all your chances..and then he would think you r too needy..when you think you are being loyal and tolerant...  why would you need this??   when your partner starts thinking yourone of his belongings...he will get bored of you..and ..you will lose all the love you have inside..  take care  and let go before he refuses to let go of you....|`|wzo1TX4Xaa	this propbably means oe of two things hes either cheating himself or has been cheated on in the past. That expalins his insecure controlling behavior.Have it out with him and if nothing changes, find the strenht 2 leave relationships should be happy not miserable x
dCzoIUP7aa	What the heck is a good girl? Isn't that like a unicorn or a gnome? Bad boy...what constitutes a bad boy? Girls don't want what they have and need what they can't tame. It is the unfortunate inability for women to be pleased.     The following is a true story.    Oh, no, you think you are happy and you try to convince us (and yourselves) that you are but then you go and screw someone while we are in Iraq and claim that you were missing something and it was a mistake and an accident. Then you do it again and this time you say it is over, you poop on our hearts. Forget the counseling and the tears and all the improvements we made. Oh wait, that guy you left me for has got you addicted to pills, he sells meth, he has warrants and a bankruptcy. Your 22 and he is 32 with 4 kids and he can't get a legit job? Maybe you made a mistake, you want to get back together? HA, look, you need to move back in with your family, finish college, get a job, get clean and figure yourself out. Your welcome for helping you see how you were destroying your life. No I don't want the $6,000 you took from me to furnish your living and habbits together. No I will not take you back, you need to be strong and I can't give you what you will deserve one day because I will always remember. I will let you go because I love you.    All is well, she is doing good. Good job, going to school, off the drugs and a new man.    Me, miserable.    So why is it that good guys always get screwed?|`|oYSDEWrfaa	I don't know, growing up i was always attracted to "bad boys" for whatever reason. I guess I thought they were "cool" or more exciting to be with. As I have matured I now realize that the "cool bad boy" guys are not necessarily the most exciting. I have found that the guys who are secure, mature, the one's who tend  not to care what people think about them, and who aren't scared to be "nice guys" are actually 2 times more attractive. For me it seems to be what I have come to understand only after having various experiences and after learning about what real "confidence" means and how it's demonstrated.     What I thought was "manly" was through a pre-conceived image of what I thought a "man" should look like and be. It wasn't based on what a "real man" was in actuality.     Also, I remember after being attracted to a bad boy if he treated me bad I did not stay because I felt bad about myself I stayed because of what I thought a woman was suppose to do. I thought when you loved someone you stay no matter what. I have since learned that you gotta love yourself before you can loves someone else and that means love yourself enough to be treated right.    Another BIG reason us girls tend to go after bad boys is not just because we think they are more exciting... I really think it's because we want to "help" or be "nurturing" in some way or another. Most of the bad guys I saw as being guys who needed love and affection to soften them up. Why I'm not sure but I seem to gravitate to them in my younger dating years, this might be worth looking into.    I view a man in touch with his emotions and a man who has the ability to understand a female's emotions as well as deal with them as being extremely attractive and I would categorize this type of person to be "more manly" now as I have grown older.    Best Wishes!|`|AA11441704	complement?|`|224cm8qtaa	because it is exciting.|`|XL1evQBRaa	"bad boys" always some how know how to play it     so i guess thats why|`|teisU4E2aa	Because all chicks say they want i nice guy but really dont if ur nice and sweet to a girl  they dont want any thing to do with you, or they walk all over you.|`|ccf98ef34d5d68794cbb95fc1994faf3aa	The bad boys tend to not be afraid to ask the questions and really make a woman feel good. It's not necessarily about being a bad boy, it's about them finding someone who is confident and can handle his own. Nice guys can do the same...but try to play it too safe sometimes.|`|ycaloVnkaa	same reason that idiots always generalize.|`|87d4tt6Raa	Lol. Idk.   I dont though.|`|QPmTzcGmaa	I am wondering the same thing.|`|d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa	There's a difference between a good girl and a dumb one.|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	I'm sorry but I had a good chuckle at that first comment.

Answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|AA11870175	It's nature over nurture. The basic laws of attraction. We are brought up in a way that we should make proper decisions and girls 'should' go for the nice and respectful guys. But how boring is that? Girls are 'naturally' attracted to the guys that like to have fun and act like the world's rules are a joke...young guys that feel or act like they are in control when they really don't even have a clue. Do girls know this? Of course...but it's the laws of attraction. It's not rational, it's just how girls are wired. Rational is boring anyways.|`|ubhpDXoYaa	BECAUSE Usually a good girl is the plain looking girl, but has an extra ordinary look in a way without make up or anything else. Bad boys are the one who chooses. Good girls can fall in love with them because some are really gorgeous. And because they are good girls they don't really push guys who are gorgeous. Good girls just make them as friends until the boys asks them out. Then there.    Hope i help! Thx!
nxHjSKTTaa	Go for it! Yes, if you realize you made a mistake by letting him go and want him back then send the card.  Just don't play games with him.  Good luck!|`|1MgpiqfJaa	that is a personal choice .. but I would not ..especially on valentines day..if you believe you made a mistake and want him back tell him so in person and leave it at that ,  if  you have already done this then the ball is in his court and if he is done with you , your chasing after him all the time is just a nuisance and a joke.    if the both of you are playing silly games and breaking up all the time and going back again ..this is a terrible waste of time and life on everybodies part including mine|`|eqaUMrYZaa	He is confused , and you are such a sexy lady.Send him a card with all your deepest feelings and emotions guys just love that.

UFOdwXgfaa	Saying sorry multiple times to save a relationship is far different from saying sorry when things have cooled off. Even if you were sincere then, the anger felt by your ex can overwhelm all other emotions. It is certainly not unusual for him or her to feel that the apology was merely a way for you to sweep things under the carpet.    If your ex knows there is nothing more for you to gain out of the apology now that the relationship is over, he will be more inclined to believe that you mean it. This would then improve your odds of getting back together.    If you want to get back together with your ex, both of you need to be able to move on. Whether you are the one who was hurt or did the hurting, you must be sincere and truly want a reunion before you embark on the move to win back your lost love. And remember, it takes two to make a relationship work.    Good luck|`|SsfnitjXaa	I think you should not bug him with any kind of communication at all and move on.|`|AA11967247	no, you should attend an alanon meeting. youve been carrying on about this ex alcoholic boyfriend that has a new girlfriend for too long.   you dont want to apologize, you want to sabotage him so that you can remain codependent on him.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	If you already apologized multiple times in person, then if he loves you at all he would have already taken you back.  Of course, we do not know what you have done to him.  Some wounds cannot be fully healed.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i would just leave it alone for now, the more u try to get him back, the worse u will feel if it doesn't happen.if u have already tried i would just wait and see what happens, its important to keep your dignity and self worth. just brings more heartache for u when u keep trying and they don't respond.|`|LWEAUWxkaa	First, ask yourself "why is he my ex?"  If you've established that you were sorry then leave it alone. If he never admitted to having anything to do with the last break-up then be careful. Sour relationships are ALWAYS two sided.

g47qtxcpaa	I would go with number 1    This pic shows a confident man that is not afraid to express himself. It shows a man that is muscular, which in return shows us women that you take pride and care about your health. he also is well groomed and takes pride in his appearance. The muscles are not just looks for us, sure they are nice but it shows us you are strong enough to protect us and strong enough to hold your own weight.    Number 2     Looks like he has cheap tattoos and is a little more feminine looking to me. His pecs are by no means tone and his hair has no style...just long and out of control. makes women think he rolls out of bed and does nothing with himself, which present laziness. Having low end tattoos also screams "I don't care what you do, just do it" show a lack of confidence and laziness. Overall he looks like he wants to be someone but does not have the ambition to take it further.    I would focus on pecs, delts, trap's, lat's, oblique's  bi's, tri's, upper and lower abs|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	Yours! Dang boy you're fiine! :)|`|izbAdDUraa	NUMBER ONE! he is hot hot hot hot.   i like a muscular/larger man.   skinny is no bueno. got to be able to carry me, throw me around in the sack and protect me from the boogeymen.|`|vYt7LWTvaa	Number 1, but I tend to like a guy that has football players shoulders|`|eqaUMrYZaa	You should focus on your small penis , muscles will not make up for that.|`|1MgpiqfJaa	pic one is definitely a better bod looking more healthy if you already have this body then you don't need any more.. a little definition without extreme cuts especially in the back and chest is a turn on..i personally don't like the huge bulk from a lot of heavy lifting (the ones whose arms cant even hang straight down at the sides)or to be so big it slows you down stay limber and fast|`|hfRiTud3aa	I'lll take you   but since i have to pick into 1 or 2 I'lll said that I'lll take   1|`|87d4tt6Raa	2|`|7387124aaf0b20926df28d2c7bcee083aa	mmmmmm def number 2, I like my men with some bulk but not too much... Tattoos are always a plus :)|`|sr0vZPQqaa	2. I hate big muscles. Slim athletic but with firm normal sized muscles is good.|`|y4dvOq4eaa	i prefer the 1st guy. i've never been that keen on orlando he's a bit too pretty and soppy. i like real men with muscles! lol So keep hitting the gym. trust me ladies love it. so long as u don't get really vain & spend all ur time in the gym. i think thats the only thing that can put girls off. girls like guys with a good personality too so even if u r not a girls usual type doesnt mean to say she won't like you.|`|YrHmrOKtaa	my opinion will go 4 no: 2|`|J6KraUzUaa	Definately the first one! -squeeeeek-|`|h9ZqxS4Caa	To me no.2 is what I prefer..men should have muscles. But not that amount of tatoos. That is not flatering at all.   By the way, you look good yourself. :0)|`|yS61H04haa	Those guys are too skinny. I think you look better now.|`|exZK0rgnaa	2|`|JjBtgSixaa	1 for sure.  I like muscular guys.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Definetely No. 1!!! Damn that's hot!!!!|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	Oh my god, if you resemble picture one I would have to say your someone I would oogle at and stare. Mouth would drop?.. Yeah. lol Your a looker, hon. :) I vote picture one but if you looked like either one thats still hot to me.|`|xbbEbvxnaa	I didn't look at the pics, but if you look like the picture you look pretty fine to me:)  A muscle man is ok, but I would like a handsome, friendly, kind hearted guy.|`|tyQnSkSnaa	definitely 1 - i like muscles|`|Y5QrpV62aa	can't see the pictures|`|UR3MjFLtaa	i would go for number one, and if that's what you look like then you would have no problem in the summer.|`|a3QNUrdfaa	2|`|KTzE2bFOaa	1, but not too many tatoos. it gets freaky.|`|rfGgMitkaa	yeah none..just tall..wide shoulders..filled arms..and legs and hips...that is it..no need for ugly tatoos..very childish..and irrisponsible..and hate muscles..very self centered man.....muscles are good when they come from ..not going to the gym..but..doing menly tasks..this is it..|`|Udym0Wqqaa	no.2 by far.|`|k6it06fiaa	I think you look damn good now...But M. Shadows is one very very hot man. I would say number 1|`|H46ZABMtaa	Defo number 1, i love great looking arms, very sexy!
GWSFecsOaa	Alright man... If she has made it clear in the past to share your personal feelings, do it. Don't go overboard and get all creepy...That will drive her away. You sound like a nice guy. After you tell her, listen to what she has to say. If the answer is something you weren't expecting to hear..keep your cool. If she says yes she would like to be closer to you, Great! Good job! You say that she has alot of guy friends... Now, if you do get together with her you need to remember...just because you guys got together it doesn't mean that she is going to stop hanging out with all the guys. DON'T BE JEALOUS. Jealousy shows that you don't trust her and its a BAD turn off. Good luck bro. Keep your head up.|`|VnqQXQZEaa	I have had the same problem before...it is really hard and confusing and people thinking that just going for it will fix everything...well it won't. If anything it will make it worse. You just need to talk to her. Don't come on to strong because she just got cheated on...I know you are tired of waiting but she just needs a friend right now...I would wait a few weeks and just let her heal a little...getting cheated on really hurts...I would know.     She seems like a great girl. Just give her time.    Hope this helped.   :)|`|VjV7W6qLaa	go out wit her|`|H42WbQATaa	look, if she doesnt like you that way ....well then the friendship "WILL" be wierd.Dont care how good of friends you are.... however if she does...im sure it would be a real nice relationship so.... go ahead and tell her.|`|mZazaHuraa	Talk it out, say you think she is cute!|`|ljyuS5Ubaa	tell her!!!! let her know that she doesn't have to respond right away, you're just putting it out there...

Whenever I give a 'gift' I tend to give cash!  I prefer to not hand it over but place it into their Bank Account .. should they not have one, then make them do it, place your humble amount into it!  We all have enough dust-collecting-items, we never have enough for the important future!!  It is NOT the gift that is important, but the thought!!!!|`|V8rV38yfaa	Watches for all.|`|AA11510511	Give them money that they can invest.|`|8EsicBxUaa	Gift cards, like HMV , Next, New Look etc....|`|rp46MQKeaa	Gift cards or cash is a must at that age|`|ISPIa0n5aa	gift cards to their favorite stores|`|c6FrTkFRaa	If its easter then why not some good old chocolate eggs!  Or if you go to the shops they have other easter presents that are not just chocolate.    If not then i think digi cams... you can get lots of different colours which would be fun :].|`|ta1ALj4qaa	Hmmm... an Easter Egg, as its Easter!!     Its not about how much money you spend!!|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Most people of that age already own mobile phones, digital cameras etc, very few teens - 20s don't have these gadgets already. I would give them a gift card for there favourite shops, that way they can choose what they want themselves and you dont risk buying them something they already have!|`|6x3ZqVpOaa	give them money ...honestly speaking ..thats what a teenager would appreciate the most ..|`|49bQbGfbaa	Wow, you must have a ton of money.

fgDLN4vZaa	NOOOOOO   wtf is that yo to many girls want guys that are 20 25 when they are 15 or 16..thats nasty....14 year old girl dating a 19 year old..thats not right...These girls are freaken gold-diggers|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Well if i turned 17 today and my girlfriend was still 16 and 11 months should I break uip with her?|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	In my mind its OK but to some people its not. 16 with 18 is not bad to me. Anything under 15 is just not cool though.  What is important is that they are following the laws of where they live so nobody gets in trouble.|`|87d4tt6Raa	haha. i think its fine.|`|kOrYXVedaa	There's no problemo,actually.|`|S6nVVfwVaa	nope|`|AA11337732	in the state of georgia,16 is the age of consent. after that, you mostly only have to worry about "what would PEOPLE think"?|`|ved8sth5aa	i dont think that people should date people younger than them|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Yes, but only by a year or so. The age gap I find acceptable (like most people) depends on both ages, but a 16 year old and a 17 year old is fine by me.|`|gBAstki5aa	yes. i'm 16 and my boyfriends 18. I also dated an 18 year old when i was 15. I see no problem with it considering how small the age difference is.|`|AA11414589	I don't think they "should" if they're doing appropriate things for the age relevance (aka not having illegal sex)     Then it doesn't really matter, innocent dating is okay|`|ljyuS5Ubaa	it doesnt keeep me up at night|`|YdWLfV4Eaa	When your this young, age is crucial. When everyone is over 20 years old I think anything is consensual because everyone above the age of 20 is mature enough to make their own decisions. I would definatly hook up with a hot 40 year old.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	No cause then there will be a wrong impression on the minds of young people. I can understand dating someone a year younger than me. Any further than that that's jail bate.|`|vxySoyjsaa	Well it should be fine as long as there's no sex after your 18, the law states that if the two partners are over 3 (mayber 4) years apart and there is no parental consent for them to be dating, it could be stated as statutory rape, but if their is parental consent, then its okay, but if they turn 18, its still considered statutory rape, even if they both agree to it, so if you want to, keep it on the DL.|`|6x3ZqVpOaa	why not.. whats the problem ...you don't look at the age while loving someone ...and if you have a problem in the future then that means that you hadn't loved her\him  in the first place at all ..|`|ZGRsjO8uaa	Age gap is not much of a problem in dating.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i think if more people allowed it there might be more divorces than there already are.anyone willing to cheat on a spouse, doesn't love them. cheating is bad and not all people accept it. it doesn't always stay just sex, sometimes the person falls in love and someone gets their heart broken.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	This is a GREAT question.  My wife and I have been together 20 years.  We really love each other and have never cheated.  BUT, there have been some times in the last few years when I could tell she really would like to just stop having sex for a while.  I am 46, healthy and my drive is still high.  And I have asked her, do you want a break, do you want me to find a girlfriend for a fling and stop having sex with you during that time?  This was not asked in anger, and it was not a "threat", it was an offer.  And I made it clear this wasn't a first step to divorce, this was a temporary alternative.  I would not move out of house etc.  Being honest about this I know she found the idea upsetting.  And her response was that she would rather take care of me than go that route.  And she has.  But you know marriage is hard.  It is great but it is sometimes painful.  And being with someone with a lower drive can sometimes be difficult.      Before anyone flames me I have had numerous chances to cheat over the years, and never have.   Never would.   "Cheating"  is about lying/sneaking.  And you know what, if the situation was reversed, I would not be surprised by the question.  I wouldn't like it, but I would understand it.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	The thought of my husband, who "I" have stood by for years, having sex with another woman makes me want to throw up.    I don't care HOW MANY years we've been married.    NO freaking way!    I am KNOW he'd agree with me!|`|kogsyGAPaa	Open marriages should not be allowed  or wanted!  Try some sex coupons or outfits to spice up the bedroom! It'll get you two closer together too!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	An open marriage is not cheating, because both husband and wife, know what is going on and usually enjoy the benefits of the encounters.  Cheating on the other hand, involves lies, and usually results in one or more getting hurt in the affair.  So do not worry about the people who tell you that it is cheating and your breaking the marriage vows, they have not walked in your shoes and have not lived life to the fullest.  Good luck.|`|b26NgqOFaa	If by 20 years of marriage I have not earned my husband's respect I might as well throw in the towel.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	That is where you are wrong.Cheating is wrong and NO we do not have to accept it.Sorry but that is a pretty lame way of thinking.It just sounds to me like these people have become bored with eachother and are looking for an acceptable way to cheat.Sorry but i am not going to be one of those people that tells you its ok.Of course cheating doesnt mean less if you've been married longer.Come on are you serious??I have been married for 12 yrs.and still going strong and i am sorry but i am one of those women that loves her man and would never ever share him.I cherish my vows and my husband.Apparently these people do not.|`|c8618f07576acf7f0719396bada43c4baa	well my opinion is that if people were lviing by the bible and living for god and not their selves there would be alot less cheating and a lot less divorce! I dont think it is right at all!!! you married that person and only that person !! in your vows did you say you were allowed to be with other people??|`|kuTzFo4caa	I honestly think it is up to the two people in the relationship. if it were to take place both people need to ask themselves "would i be ok with this?" and while you picture it happening if you feel any ounce of jealousy or anger or anything negative then don't do it. But if BOTH people are entirely comfortable then go for it. sometimes relationships need some spice added esp. after 20 yrs.     and cheating is really up to how the two of you look at it. if it is a mutual decision then it wouldn't be cheating.|`|MLdykhQNaa	I had a friend who talked his wife into letting them each have a fling.  She was reluctant but they went out and she found a guy like right away and he eventually "settled" on a girl.  Well they both went back to their place and the guy couldn't even have sex with his girl because he was so depressed at watching his wife eagerly devour the other guy's...junk with her mouth.  They got divorced a little while later.  They were married for 15 years at the time.  So I'd vote no.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I think it depends on the relationship and what both people want in that relationship. Some people believe that it actually strengthens the relationship. To each his own..|`|NyjxygFmaa	I think that someone may end up getting jealous in the long run. Or if the man was the on to have the sexual encounter the woman he has it with may become attached to him you never know. There is nothing wrong with exploring you have earned it being married for that long. Just make sure you know what the two of you are getting into.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	Open marriage is interesting if they do roaming together, I mean, they tell each other all the details, and they can be pleased by the other's adventures, too, not only their own one. Or do it together litarally, e.g. 3some. Etc.|`|dprURFLxaa	Absolutely.  I actually have this conversation with my hub all the time.  Just because you are dedicating your lives to each other does not mean that neither one of you will ever feel a sexual attraction to someone else.  If you allow each other to satisfy that together then the bond between the two of you grows stronger.  You are still dedicating your lives together and understanding the other persons physical desires at the same time.  Love and sex are not the same thing.|`|RlcfZAxQaa	It's OK for the guy to do that - have a fling, or a bit on the side.    But definitely not the way to go for the female.|`|woPLfLQbaa	There is no right or wrong answer to this question because there are many dynamics that play a role on determining what is best. First if you are a devout christian and believe in jesus christ than of course there is absolutely no outside intimate relationships with others outside of your marriage. PERIOD. However if your beliefs go another way than the pros and cons need to be inventoried in you. Remember when emotions get caught up that is what is detramental in any kind of relationship. Some people can not seperate the act of sex and emotions.|`|otq0Pv3Paa	if a husband or wife wants to explore they should do it with their spouse. marriage is a commitment. there is no law saying you have to get married so if someone is not ready to make that commitment for a lifetime, they should not get married. true, cheating does happen, but that doesn't make it right and it won't make it right if people say it's ok. all it would bring is doubt and insecurity. granted there are a FEW couples who can enjoy things like this with no consequences, but that is rare. bottom line- if you want to help your marriage, don't add people. add people. add problems.
34ruM1eDaa	I dont think so. It took me nearly 2 years to get over a mere CRUSH (we liked each other, but were too shy to do anything about it) I cant imagine how long it would take me if Id asked someone out and he had rejected my love! lol|`|LZzsDARUaa	no...:D|`|56yUJnlIaa	no never|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Um  did you mean to say forgive them?? Idk, I mean its really up to you. I say move on with your life you deserve to be with someone who actually wants to be with you.  Don't waste too much time in pain over the situation.

uPL3e3tyaa	I can tell you precisely why: because of the way you view love. If when you were with a man you threw yourself into the moment emotionally, you wouldn't have time or the inclination to notice that there was even another guy present. The plain truth of the matter is: you're always hunting for your next conquest. How do I know this, you ask? Well, I used to look at relationships the same way...until I realized that I was always looking for a way out from under or greener grass through other women.|`|fB2vdKtSaa	wow - where are you meeting all these guys pam give me some tips!! lol just go out with them both, its only a drink afterall isn't it?  why would the smaller guy ever find out? you may be more suited to the taller guy so dont dismiss him just cos you have been seeing someone for 2-3 weeks.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	for me it nothing, then nothing comes along.|`|dwiuV0Hvaa	i always wonder y things like this happen coz it always happen 2 me  you have just 2 options & lots of risk 2 take.    1st is u continue with ur present guy & hope things works out(u might be lucky & things will work out perfectly)(hoping is like taking a risk)or    2nd u snick 2 a date with the better guy & risk the 1st guy finding out.  wen he does he might be furious with u & u will end up losing him.and if u re unfortunate u might loss the new guy as well coz he will think if he starts something with u, u might cheat on him.(u might be lucky & non will find out abt each other).(double risk)      so its left 4 u 2 choose.    wat u will do. or which ever is best 4 u.    risk risk risk!!!    girl life can be tough somtimes & put us in a puzzle like situation.    well if its me i will cleverly snick 2 a date with the new guy & i will cover my tracks well so that i wont be caught.    its fun sometimes if u snick around a little. but u must be 101% careful.    good luck|`|AA11934996	Hi Pam,    Remember you can not have your cake and eat it, I would explain to the tall guy that you are seeing somebody at the moment, but keep his phone number in case things go wrong, as I am sure you would not like the man you are dating to be seeing two women at the same time so why do it to him, first come first served and all that.    I could be over re-acting, as you know what my moral compass is like but I say either stay with short guy nice guy (remember I am a nice guy) or dump him and chase after tall guy.    At the end of the day the choice is yours, and it is your conscience you have to live with.    Hope I have helped a little.  Take care|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Don't you give a guy a chance before you hop away!? Do you even know how compatible you are with the guy are dating ??    Don't start to become shallow, eventually you are going to settle down, and if you won't give a guy that you are with a chance, and yourself a chance with that guy you aren't ever going to keep a man .    That's ok if you like that, but their is always going to be someone you are attracted to , and if they ask you out, or ask to sleep with you while you are seeing someone else it isn't going to go over well. I don't think that you want to be called a whore, slut either....eventually I could see it happening if you hop around like petter bloody cotton tail ...    I think that right now you are with someone , and you have needs and wants that have not yet been confirmed, some of which you don't even know about yet. On one hand you're a little shallow, and you want the bigger , more beautiful guy...yawnnn yawnnnn...    On the other hand you might just be looking for self worth, and you haven't given your relationship a chance yet to prove that you have that in the relationship.    Don't be such a bore though , the guy would prob sleep with you and move on, do you think mr. ideal confidence, super model , who asks you out on spare of the moment, doesn't have the confidence, influence to be asking out other women!?    Please, you're special but not that special,not in that way . The guy sounds fake , if you want to break up with some lovely guy just because some fantasy book character with false promises is asking you out then by all means go ahead, but reality is going to turn the curve and you may end up used, and alone .|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Oh my goodness,try being single for 2 years pam then you will se how difficult things can be.Its not so bad for women they just have to WAIT for a guy to chat them up and they have all the choice in the world.Things are much harder for me,i ask girls out and ive been rejected too often in the last 2 years,the thing that makes it worse is girls will flirt with me or act like they are interested then i get the phone number and then i get rejected or lead on then i find out they found a boyfriend.    I think im cursed i really do,girls show interest in me then i dont even get anywhere with them.I know what you mean though when i was 18 this same thing happened to me in my LUCKY days.I had two girls fighting over me lol i was allready with sombody but the other girl who liked me was much hotter than the girl i was with.What did i do? I walked away from both of them.You know what im 27 now and i have no luck i regret the past,think hard about things make things work so that you dont regret your decissions in the future.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Dating is not the same as a relationship. Date the two of them and make it clear it is dating. There's plenty of time to decide who you want to be exclusive with-Depending on if you want to be with either of them once you get to know them.|`|09zVUMBRaa	Be the playa that I know is in you...Do them both!|`|EENUWAP7aa	You know how it's, that's normal in today's world.

Just don't lie to either of them about it.|`|Pdex43zgaa	You are not looking for a relationship when you are in a relationship, so you don't look as desperate, and men find you more attractive because you are happier.|`|UsGF7haFaa	you are so rite no one tries to talk to me when im single but the minute i get someone thats when they all come around but im pretty sure the 1st guy noy gonna find do you go with him if not then yall r just friends that doesnt mean that you have to talk to just hm so he shouldnt mind|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	I would say that you're allowed to date both guys. Unless you really like the first one and have been spending quality tmie together and you don't want to risk anything screwing it up, dont date the new guy. But in these early stages, i would date around. That's what dating is about. Until you're exclusive, don't worry about anything.
z2ykc1Knaa	Sounds like she wanted to go see the movie with YOU, not you and your entourage. I think she saw it as a date, because she likes you. I'd be ticked too if I invited a guy to go to a movie with me and he brought a group along with him.    And of course it would be hard for her to explain. It's hard enough for us girls to admit when we like a guy, but she probably thinks that you don't like her. And why embarrass yourself in front of the guy you like if you think he doesn't like you back. Only you know your feelings, but I would say think about your feelings for her before talking to her again.|`|BGTkTNQyaa	She's going through that weird growth stage that women go through...the one where if she gets pissed she doesn't talk about it....no! Hell no! She has to be quiet and shut down!!! Also, women tend to go through this stage where they can't go to the potty by themselves....like they think the toilet monster will get them or something. I'm sure she likes you, but women in that mysterious stage have to act really crazy instead of just kicking back and enjoying their time with you.|`|LihoWe84aa	duh talking!  you idiot she probably wanted you to go to the movies with her cuz she likes you and was upset when you brought people cuz she wanted you alone. Then she probably texted her gfs to come .  Stupid boy!  Rebecca|`|cu2mJmvZaa	its obvious she likes you bud.  why do GUYS have to be so complicated?|`|15Wld3wCaa	she likes you, its obvious =P    she was probably fixing her hair and bitchign about you in the bathroom ..|`|XL1evQBRaa	right the thing is about guys, you don't even try to understand. there are lots of things you can do in the bathroom with your friend which you don't feel comfortable doing out in public.    like talking about whats bothering you... crying... makeup....  that was probably what she was doing in the bathroom.    girls are emotional. we like to be close to our feelings, and once we don't like something, we will react. I don't think its anything personal to you, or just general boys, but maybe because you're not even asking her if something is wrong, and actually trying, you're asking people on yahoo who can't possibly give you a straight answer.|`|35dbb8815b6f803a7bba30e85c362198aa	because boys are complicated.  um fix ourselves what else :o|`|yZ21oCuSaa	she likes you. idiot.|`|jr4aNLLlaa	I think she likes you|`|7u33Zruhaa	She likes you, god. Shes always fixing her hair because she likes you, and asked you to the movies and got pissed because she didn't invite your friends  cause she wanted to see you on her own. Also, if a girl asks you to the pictures, you don't change the movie shes asked to see, its rude. And twilight's a love story, taking the hint yet?|`|AA11636892	lol your second question made me laugh  looks like she is interested in you, thats what made her annoyed when you brought some of your friends and coming to the part what the girls were doing.. come on, they were having a discussion as to how to impress you or somethin like that    lastly, you know why she fixes her hair although its fine? its something that young girls like to do.. admire themselves,dress more nicely.its quite natural. well , im pretty sure she has a crush on you.. but its up to you to find out
UOLtJocMaa	Do not pay attention to the first answer, that person is a ****.  It seems to me you are only a caring gf who realized that the plans changed you had made changed somehow.  So just let him go to NYC when he gets ready.  You could maybe have him meet you for his gift before he goes. Or just give him everything in advance, whatever works best for you guys!     Meet up with him in the city Valentines Day I am sure he is not working the entire day.  He will be done with his day hopefully not too tired.  Maybe even get him a card to congratulate him on getting under the tents.  See if you can stay with your brother maybe and spend the night on Valentine's Day so you can hang out with him again the next day since you said he is not working.  Maybe that day you can still attend the art show or find something else to do because NYC is filled with things to do.  This way its more of like a weekend type thing if that works for your schedule.    Also make sure you have a little fun yourself since it is such a hassle.  Might as well make the most of the trip! If money really worries, mention that to him.  I think you should go though you may find you have a great time together!  Come to the city prepared like pack an overnight bag perhaps with a change of clothing and such. You have to really go all out wardrobe wise, I mean the dude is doing fashion week.  I would suggest getting your sexiest outfits and stuff. Good luck sweety I know things will pan out well for you guys.  Have fun.|`|fc2wmTCVaa	Look if he is paying go.|`|8IyZphFVaa	yea, you should go. just make plans for yourself so it's not a total waste of money and time. give him his bday present before he leaves and he can open it when he gets there. i'm confused about something though. you guys were supposed to go together so was it supposed to be a one-day thing or what? and what about the money? how were you planning to get to/from nyc before? why don't you just ask him to help with whatever you can't afford?|`|2JJLYSAKaa	This is his life, his future.  If you want it to include you you should understand.  Do you have any idea what fashion week is?  Do you have any clue how important it is?      Stop thinking about yourself.  He deserves better than your needy clingy BS.|`|f9wHTaURaa	ok look he asked you to go with him maybe he has something plained for you and him to do so go and new york is fun trust me i had a lot of fun there|`|DgePrR9daa	im goin to NYC For fashion week tooo :)
zCWcoFhZaa	HI I can undertand how some people might think that you are being overly jealous but I can see where you are coming form, I have a son and my mum is the same with my nephew her other grandson, he gets what he wants and he is a right moody and cranky so and so he even hits and trys to bit and gets away with it, but if my son gets a little cranky he gets told off, Im like that is just not on so I say something. And then my mum is all nice to my son when my nephew has gone home.  But as its you that isnt getting any attenstion dont worry about it, when you nephew comes round just go to your room and keep out of the way. I know you probably want to spend time with your nephew and its not his fault hes like that but, it it annoyes you so much just stay out of the way and let you mum deal with him. Its because its her first grandchild why she is probably like that all mums are I know. but its not for long when they go home you can have your space back
1XarqgE6aa	If I were her I would try to find a way to move to Texas where she would be free and would be able to do as she plzed also that way she could believe in whatever religion she wanted to believe in. I think that doing all of what her parents want her to do is completely out of line. I just hope that if she is 18 she is not still living with all this pain and hurt.|`|YtSGbYqEaa	she needs to find a way out move to texas nobody should have to live that way plan it all out before you leave then take your stuff and get out i wish there was a way to help..... good luck and god bless her|`|D1GCvPtHaa	there is always a reason to live. she may feel terrible but i bet one day she will look back and be glad that she didn't kill herself. even if she hates her life now one day everything will be completely different. just remind her that you're there for her always (: tell her that even if shes not living for her parents to live for you!    god bless Xx|`|Tao9nkkiaa	I am very impress about ur question and ur thoughts.i want to do frndshp wid u.can u??pls..dont ignore it bcoz i feel ur so kind.m really saying ur question and ur thoughts touched my hrt.pls.. Mail me at monish_sippy@yahoo.com.ok,byee,cya..m waitng for ur ans.?|`|j8y3jjimaa	well how about seeking help from the police or welfare organizations?  perhaps your friend could have some kind of protection from them    well i think she should surround with positive things, thinking and people. maybe this will allow her to develop a more positive attitude.   I don't know if the situation allows, perhaps she can go for counseling where she can receive advice, or maybe become a volunteer so she can make new friends and get to know people who is more positive.|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	I felt that way before . the best thing to do is to not give up hope . =) You'll find the guy your looking for in dew time . Don't bring out the negatives in yourself bring out the positives . =) no bodied perfect we all make mistakes , but its learning from our mistakes that count the most . =)    Toya|`|8IyZphFVaa	maybe talk to her about slaves? i don't know if she is allowed to read or how you guys are in communication but maybe you can read her some books from people who have been in situations like this. her life does seem like hell but just be a good friend. tell her to have hope and to do what she can for now. she has to find some ways to express herself and find purpose. as long as she is proactive and tries, something will come to her. but she has to stop putting so much energy into fighting her situation the wrong way. there are self-imposed limits, limits that come from other people or other situations that take time to overcome, and limits that can't be helped. she can work to change the things that she can change, be patient about the things that may take time to change, and accept the things that can't be helped as far as we know. unless she has a strange illness or has missing body parts or something she has no real limits. everything else will just take some searching and patience on her part.
l54KgghDaa	don't mind the third party, as long as you go along with this friend of yours, everything will be just fine and someday your friend would realized that you are more than important to her than her close friend  Take it gradually step by step let her feel your sincerity and soon u will win her as your best friend|`|0kzMLoP5aa	I strongly disagree with what you say,i.e. you should really give her her space!But if you feel,you must be hers without others involved,then make more plans,confide more,blah blah blah.  But more importantly let her have time with others too!|`|7d8b092b0508a647a38976703a57cc4faa	you should make a moke and start talking more to this girl, tell her secrets and stuff so she can have trust you more:)|`|5r48jn7iaa	the girl you want as your best friend, just start making plans with her, act to hang out at the mall, hang out at your house, sleepovers, movies, anything. show her you can be a fun best friend but at the same time a caring best friend.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	ask her to hang out at your house one night for a movie girls night.  then both of you can chill and get to know each other better.  But watch out for those girls that can use you. since she is a new friend I would be aware.  maybe she isn't a Friend if she is ignoring you. you say she is hanging out with this other girl also and you don't like her much I'd step away go find a new new friend you'll only get hurt.|`|Tao9nkkiaa	Hey ritu.I want to become ur good frnd.can u??am male 18 frm india.pls..male me at monish_sippy@yahoo.com.ok..byee..cya.tak... care.rply me soon.
4b5IQWcFaa	give her something related to you both like a pic of both of you framed by you(make it as nice as possible)  or something related to a song she absolutely adores  by a plain shirt and paint on it many memories of yourz like captions,or quotes from ur frndship,your and her pics stuck in a collage  personally  a collage is the best  stick as many as pics as you can of both of u in random and add to it decorative stuff she likes like that oh so prettty plastic doll she adores or something like that.  or just make a simple heart necklace,  make a heart out of hard clay and cut it in to 2 pieces.  tell her to hang 1 part of it round her neck forever u hang the other the same way.  so when both pieces come together u get a perfect heart  a symbol of your friendship.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	A necklace of something she loves (if she loves music, get one with a music note etc)    A photo album of all of the pictures of the two of you.    If you had more time I'd suggest a scrapbook.|`|MSnfmeP0aa	get her a t-shirt of her favourite colour.on it print best snaps of both of u like a collage,moments that u  cherish n wants her 2 treasure forever.n in d back of t'shirt u can print a few lines saying how much u miss her.............she will keep ur gift forever!!|`|2pq3y2ghaa	How about making her a memory box.. put in pictures of you both together..write her a card and put it in there.. maybe buy one of those friendship bracelets?  Just tell her how much you're going to miss her and I'm sure she will love it.|`|G7sANdhFaa	how about a music box that hold jewelry
AA11870175	Too soon for what? Depends on what you are worried about. Maybe what your friends or your ex will think of you? You may think you are disrespecting your ex? Only you can decide how much time is enough to wait. Your ex will be your ex no matter if you wait 2 days or 2 years. If you are emotionally ready then you are ready. I personally think you shouldn't set a time line but take a few months at least to date different guys and see what's out there before jumping into another serious relationship. You may get a thousand different answers, some of them will be passionately driven, but only you know when you are ready.|`|nCXOZBFZaa	Trust your heart. Your instincts will tell you when is the right time to start another relationship. This does not mean that you can not date! Dating is awesome and along the way you meet all kinds of nice people. When the right person comes along, every nerve in your body tells you so! Now relax, and have some fun!  You went through tough emotional times recently....it time to get back on your feet :)|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Take your time sweety, the new guy should understand.  Out of respect, he will honor your decision because if you just get with new guy now its like you kind of just found a rebound and thats all you were looking for. If this guy is so great, he is worth getting to know before rushing anything. Give yourself at least like 3 months or so then make moves towards a relationship if your heart desires.  A month is kind of quick to move forward from a 2 yr relationship.  Avoid the rebound or fling stage out of respect for your ex and yourself.|`|5r48jn7iaa	you cant feel guilty, he moved away. its ok to like other people and move on since you both agreed not to do the long distance thing. but i wouldn't start a new relationship until you feelings for your ex go away.|`|Y5QrpV62aa	you still can take it slow while yall going together.   Because just going together is just going together it's just a relationship|`|fA42bQHraa	There's nothing wrong with taking it slow and getting to know him better before you become romantic. That is a good idea anyway that has nothing to do with ending a two year relationship.    Once you and your boyfriend decided to skip the long distance thing you mutually ended the relationship and any commitment associated with it.     There's no reason to feel guilty.|`|QCtJJ04Uaa	It might be best to wait a little bit. You must still be missing your boyfriend and you don't want to jump into anything new with your feelings all jumbled up like that. Its good that you explained the situation to the new guy. Spend some time outside of a relationship and enjoy the single life for a while. You're instincts are telling you that it may be too soon...and your instincts are rarely wrong!|`|nYEwK5FNaa	Don't feel guilty. Your ex-boyfriend moved, if you feel like taking it slow, there is nothing wrong with that, you make your own decisions you're grown at 25.|`|705dbe30dde9b45b3c57171f93776b70aa	no it's not too soon because u an your ex aren't 2gether anymore. So why worry??? He is no longer your concern u have to face that fact and move on cus I am pretty sure he is!!|`|WJOp1xgraa	its not your faoult go out and have fun start a new life with somebody else u need to girl :)
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I believe that two people can be happy in making the decision that no matter what comes at them in life, they want to go through it together. No one has a fairy tale life... but happiness, that comes from spending your life building something with the one you love and the one that loves you back.|`|RWffWDchaa	yes|`|J81bLTvsaa	Yes. If the partner learns his/her lesson and is willing to change.|`|AA10985791	Nope, not at all.  The romantic side of me died a slow and painful death  a few years back, unfortunately, maybe I'll find it again sometime in the future.    I believe in the happy here and now, that much I can do something about.  But mostly happiness is an attitude, not a situation.|`|shoW3JpPaa	No, I don't. There is always something that comes up, and life is not a fantasy. In storybooks/fairy tales, a lot of times the story ends, and they lived happily ever after. One, that makes an easy ending and Two, it adds to the fairy tale Aurora.|`|k4yz6Y2Laa	Funny|`|AA11570236	Most of us don't know what we are doing.|`|AA12203329	It happens...trust me!|`|WSIZKAQcaa	no|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	Yes, but there are always issues in life. You can keep your happiness as long as you can handle stressful days.|`|znT5ApQeaa	i do just because a person did something to you it not over.|`|AA11990465	Some days I do and some days I don't.

If I do attend a wedding, I send a gift along to the reception and spend what I can afford based on how close I am to the couple.     Only you can decide what is best.|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	Send what you can afford.  There's no need for you to go in debt over someone else's wedding.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Don't worry about what other people spend! You just get something you know you can afford! Remember, it's the thought that counts!|`|wADnvKGFaa	Well the rule of thumb is the gift should reflect the price of dinner.  Since you're not going I would send $50.00 or get a gift certificate to the store they are registered at for $50.00.  If thats too much then just send what you can afford.  This isn't about the gift and they should be grateful for anything they get!    Good luck|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Just send a check for 50 dollars.|`|NW5WEwfcaa	Only the thought counts.  Send whatever you can afford.  Or a nice card with a regret note about your not being able to attend.   Good luck|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	I'd probably send a check for $50. I missed my nephews wedding last summer so I sent them a check for $200. It really depends on what you can afford and how close a relationship you have with the soon to be couple.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	Do a $50 gift certificate to wherever they are registered, because other people are going to be in the situation and may only by a few items as well, and they can pick what they need to add to their collection.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Send them a card with a $50 gift card inside or, go to Things Remembered at the mall and get them something personalized. It will be cheaper than the stuff on their registry and they will love it!|`|VELnLnIKaa	you are unbelievable! 1 mug 1 plate  remember this when your having an anniversary or birthday party why not just rsvp your regrets and stay home|`|AA12204338	Honestly, with the economy the way it is I'd send one mug or one salad plate.  They should understand.  It's crazy to spend that much on a mug or a plate but if that's your budget then so be it.  I wouldn't think twice about it.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Send a gift card to the store the registered at for around $25--$50, this way she can put your gift card along with all the others she gets and it will wind up being alot.  Seriously $50 here and a $25 there really adds up.  Right now most people cannot afford alot and you are sweet to send what you can.
8t0DlWf8aa	:-\ i will say it again..you cant find the love..love will come to you..searching for a guy that you may like him is not love..take courage and just wait..it may come soon or...you know :-)|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	All that you can do is wait, because God has certainly made someone for each and every person in this earth. Do not haste in such delicate matters or you can fall prey for a guy who does not love you but lusts you.

It is nice to be with someone but why not try to think of the positives of being single? you get to flirt with who ever you want and not have to be tied down to someone!  You could try joining some clubs though or do some volunteering where you will meet new people and maybe some nice looking lads as well as doing something good, interesting and look good when you apply to colleges, uni's and for a job.

There will be lots of time for that when you are older because the idea may sound good now but teenage boys are complicated your best off just going out with your mates and having a good time and your only 15 this may sound mean but i am speaking from experience. Why do you want to be tied down so young anyway|`|RlcfZAxQaa	If you are thinking of topping yourself - please try not to make a mess. It is somewhate disconcerning for others.
63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	I would say that the more intense your feelings one way, the more potential that you can have equally intense feelings in the opposite way.  But I'm not sure you can apply this to the same person or to all people.  Having extreme emotions at the same time (love/hate relationships) is not healthy.      For example:    If you loved someone for their fidelity and loyalty to you, you'd hate them more and more if you found them cheating on you.    If you love someone for being responsible and supportive, you'd hate them for stealing your money or backstabbing you.    The 'hate' in these situations would be a result of both your image of the other person being tarnished or corrupted - as well as your own needs or expectations being unfulfilled by someone you thought would be able to meet them.|`|AA11636892	not really.. all I can say is that Faults are thick when love is thin|`|icTmbLjfaa	"Its thin line between love and hate" very easy to cross over lol|`|IPS3hWweaa	No! That little phrase makes absolutely no sense at all!    Forget it and move along.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Yes it is true.|`|0oiAQ4jvaa	Not True. If you relly hate someone, you will never ever love he or she.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Of course not, you can love much all the time.  Hate only because of something horrible they did, and even then they can be forgiven..|`|Tao9nkkiaa	Yes it is right.I want to do frndshp wid u.can u be my frnd???mail me at monish_sippy@yahoo.com.m waitng for ur ans.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Weeel, the more you feel, the more you...feel!   It is true that the stronger your feelings towards someone, the more likely you are to feel the opposite emotion. If that person didn't matter to you then you wouldn't feel so strongly when something hurts you that they say or do.  The opposite of love is NOT hate, it's indifference.|`|de61a8ce1c1905694dcd685844ccfe27aa	I go with what u have said..  If u love someone very much and something goes wrong beyond control most probably u wud hate that person the most.

aFaSMYPFaa	FOR NOW.... asking him out doesnt sound such a good idea to be honest. Its pretty clear he's not looking for a girlfriend. Persevere :) if its meant to be it'll happen one way or another|`|DgePrR9daa	just keep flirting and stuff  dont ask him out because it could ruin the friendship if he says no- might make him feel akward|`|FORX7yfQaa	Ask him out. The worst that could happen is say no.|`|wXKs94nDaa	At this age, guys think its cool to flirt. And he's just having fun. I think you should do the same too.

rLk2w03gaa	Don't lie, don't cheat on him, don't flirt with other guys.  Keep your word, always.  Don't keep secrets from him unless they are harmless, such as what one of your friends said to another one.  Don't be selfish, but don't be a doormat, either.    Be nice to his mother, and the rest of his family.  Have good table manners, dress becomingly and be friendly when you meet his friends and family so that you are never an embarasment to him.    DON'T TRY TO CHANGE HIM.  Later, when sex is an issue, remember that a woman's greatest need is to be loved, honored, and cherished.  A man's greatest need is sex.  I learned that at a Christian marriage conference.  Good luck.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Be loyal and fun to be around.|`|d8pt9KMyaa	ummm... no, sex is all that really matters in the end.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Love him unconditionally each and everyday.Support him in whatever he does and let him know that you are there for him.Accept him for who he is even with his faults.Assure him that whatever happens in your lives you will be there for him to love him and if he falls you will be there to pick him up.Just be the best girlfriend you know how to be.Just love him and let him know it every single day.|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	BE A GODLY WOMAN... THAT'S ALL A MAN REALLY WANTS|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Be upbeat and positive, fun to be around. Be ready for anything from a sophisticated and romantic evening to throwing on a ball cap and heading for the mountains. What most men want is to be around a woman that they can relax around, let their guard down, and just be who they are with. Sure, for the first few dates everyone is on their best behavior... but at some point you just have  to be who you are around a guy. It you like him, if you are attracted to him... learn to be his friend first... that will form a solid bond.

Make him his favorite foods and little things like making him a drink, rubbing his back, giggle and make him smile. Let him do things for you, guys like to feel needed and like "the man".  Good luck|`|LYdl0Wplaa	Be there for him. Share in some of his interests. If he's interested, share some of your interests with him. Be open with him. Show him that you care about him and love him, but don't over do it. Don't push him away when he wants to show you. Unless it starts leading to things you don't want or are not ready for. Remember every guy is different. So this may not work for some guys.
bhs05edAaa	Sadly, in my youth, many times. In the past, society generally made fun of intuition, especially women's intuition, calling it stupid, unscientific nonsense. But its not. On a pretty much unconscious level, we all project energy. When you feel something weird, off, even dangerous about another's energy, never ignore it. Find out right away what is wrong. If they will not admit to anything, say goodbye. It really is not worth the risk.But  do not worry, there will be others for you to fall in love with! I promise!|`|rXORvIstaa	Yes, I seem to have a pattern with it as far as some of my love relationships go.  I have done things against my intuition and suffered for it, and others have suffered as a consequence.  I feel guilty for causing the pain to others and myself.  I'm trying to find out why I have done these things so as not to repeat them.  I think there are many reasons.  It would be hard to pretend to feel love when you don't.  I think it could only be done for a short while.  Living like that would be an empty hell.  You need to learn to listen to your inner voice, and follow it.  Even if you're wrong, at least you did what you thought was right, and I would be willing to bet that voice will be right way more often than wrong.  Peace be with you.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	yes many times when i knew down deep someone wasn't a good person, i ignored my gut feeling and paid a high price for it later on.|`|AA12204338	Oh yeah!

I dont't know why you say you don't trust his ex-wife, you dont have to trust her.You are not in a relationship with her.I think you need to talk to your Fiance, because it is him you clearly don't trust!

You are a liar and a needy clingy woman.|`|tCI8ksvdaa	At this point you have no reason not to trust him.  So if you still feel you don't trust him, then you are far too immature for a marital relationship and you should break up.

71VRvldJaa	I was in a similar situation to you only it wasn't a family owned business.  I worked round the clock trying to stay on top of things.  I ended up having a major burn out.  I broke down at work one day and cried and cried and cried.  I was totally out of control.  As a result of the burnout, I developed some major health issues.  It is now 2 1/2 yrs later and I'm only now starting to feel "human" again.  The money you're getting paid really isn't the issue....if you were making 10 times the money, you would still be burnt out and feeling depressed.  There's an old saying that you have to spend money to make money!  New businesses often run at a loss for the first 5 years of operation.  If you burn out or get sick and you're doing the work of 8-10 people, that will be 8-10 people short if your health breaks and you can't do it any more.  If this wasn't a family business, you probably would have moved on by now or made demands that more staff be hired.  If you're covering that many positions, you can't possibly be doing any of them to maximum potential so the business is going to suffer anyway.  You need a break....you need time for yourself.....you need to be able to go home and not be constantly thinking of what all you have to do when you get back to work the next day.  Believe me when I say that recovering from a burnout and the accompanying health issues is NOT a nice thing to go through.  It was 3 months before I was physically able to even get out of bed.  A new business really needs to focus on customer service which seems to be a thing of the past at most places these days.  If there are no knowledgeable, outgoing, friendly, helpful staff to greet and assist your customers, the business won't last very long.  You need to take care of yourself or you won't be able to care for anyone else.|`|hHndD5SEaa	you need to speak to your dad - tell him that you just cant cope and you need extra help. At the end of the day - its your familys interest to have this place running as efficiently as possible - and by you not being able to give 100% to it - then its not going to run as good as it could.  xx|`|u7zmUivHaa	just get more staff in :/|`|6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	I would sit down with my Father and explain your worries as soon as you can.  He would be glad to know that you are able to recognize that you are not able to do the job up to par alone.  Perhaps there is a way to hire help to get things started at a reasonable rate and once things are better organized you will be able to take the reins.  I wish you luck.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	I think you should leave - your job is sapping the life out of you.    There was a recent episode of Oprah where a career expert basically said if you hate your job get out. It really helped me because I was forcing myself to do a stressful job I didn;t like too.    The name of the career expert is Marcus Buckingham. He basically said you should stick to a career that makes you happy and you are good at - people end up earning more money doing something they love and are good at because they put the effort into it.    Your career is draining you of your happiness. Google Oprah Marcus Buckingham - they have a free career course to work out whether your job is right for you.    I personally believe no one should be that unhappy in their jobs. And happiness should come first. I came top at a journalism degree in college and people wanted me to be a serious journalist reporting on tragedy every day and knowing the name of every foreign leader all over the world. I could have pursued that but it made me unhappy and i wasnt being true to myself. I found my real passion is in entertainment so now I write about fashion, celebrities etc. In the end you have to do what you have a passion for - and if you have a passion for it you'll know because you'll enjoy it.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My SiL had a framed note in the entry way next to the seating cards that denoted they were making a donation to a charity in lieu of larger favors (the groom lost his mother to some disease). That was a fine way to make the reference.     Honestly? I feel donating to charity is a personal thing and a great gesture. However, I don't feel it has a place at a wedding. If the couple wants to donate to a charity, that's cool, but they don't need to glorify it by letting everyone know how socially aware they are. Just forgo the favors and the notice, people should donate to charity all the time, not just because they are getting married.     Due to research and education, I am well aware of how the funds are used in organizations and charities. Make sure if you DO donate, you know that the money is going directly to research, not marketing and paying people's salaries.     Good luck!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you don't have to print out some expensive thing for each place setting, just make the donation and print 1 card for each table that tells about the donation in lieu of favors.  I've never been to a wedding that did that but I wish people did because edible favors are eaten and forgotten, mix CD's are stupid, and jordan almonds break my teeth.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I've been to a couple of weddings where the couple donated instead of giving out favors.    Most organizations will be able to provide you with scrolls or something similar.  If not, you can easily make something yourself...even a bookmark for each place setting is a nice idea.    You don't go to a wedding to get favors (I know some posters put something to the effect that they hate this idea because they essentially get nothing out of it), but to celebrate.  If it's an organization that means something to you, then that's great and it's an even better favor than some box of chocolates or a candle.|`|AA11603468	I know it's somewhat of a trend, but in all honesty, I hate this trend. I am heartfully sorry you lost your brother (I'd be lost without mine), and I certainly encourage donating to charity and volunteering your time to causes that are important to you, but why do you have to do a charity tie-in to your wedding? A wedding is a special enough event to be celebrated on it's own-with no other side causes. Also, favors are not required, and yes, they're mostly a waste, but if you feel compelled to give me a small gift, give me something, not a piece of paper that says my gift was given to someone else-which is what that amounts to.    EDIT: If you so wish donations be made to the charity, why don't you state on your invitations that "in lieu of gifts, please make a donation to the American Cancer Society (or whichever charity)--you ARE doing the same thing to your guests.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	This is what we're doing for our wedding.     I would contact the organization you want to send the money to and find out what their options are. Give what ever you planned on spending on favours.      My fiance used to work at a country club and time and time again the favours are just tossed. That's money and time going in the garbage  so he was very anti-favours when we started wedding planning.     We haven't really worked out the details but here are our ideas for our alternate favour presentation.     1) We will have a bowl of mints on the table so guests have something for after dinner and place a tag on the table explaining that in honour of our guests a donation has been made.  our MC will also explain    2) same bowl of mints with cards made up for each guest thanking them for attending the wedding and explaining the donation.    3) bowl of mints again but make the cards into home made book marks. At least if they don't want the book marks they can be recycled and for guests that want something to remember the wedding they have a book mark. All you need is some card stock a printer and a paper cutter.     Really how many candles and boxes of candies does a person need?  The charity we selected has allowed me to dance at my wedding and walk down the aisle. ( it's an organization that provides prosthetic limbs to people)  So the way I look at it any guest who wanted their tacky little favour that bad can bring it up with me. Lets face it 99% of favours are tacky and useless and end up in a landfill 10 minutes after the guests leave.     Also using the favour budget as a donation is hopefully going to stop my mother from turning the speech portion of the wedding into the " YAY my daughter's not dead" fest. How to make guests and the bride uncomfortable 101 have the bride's family bring up over and over again how they didn't think she would ever get married because they thought she was going to die of cancer as a kid.  Enough already let's move on.     From my experience donations in person are best but online donations are becoming more popular. If there has been a group that helped you personally go with them. Ask questions it doesn't hurt to know how your money will be used.    Edit:   Donations to honour your guests has nothing to do with cutting costs. All the couple has to do is take what ever money they had intended to spend on favours and donate it.    It isn't and shouldn't be about " look at us we're awesome. "      More and more people in the wedding industry are embracing the idea of giving back at the wedding. I've been to a few weddings where you put in a coin to get the bride and groom to kiss and the change goes to a charity.     some couples make donations rather than giving gifts.     More people who don't want or need gifts are encouraging guests to donate to a charity that has touched the couples life or is important to the guest.     At the last two bridal shows I've attended donation favours were highlighted.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	typical favors are lame and a waste of money. People do not want bookmarks or coasters with the bride/groom's names or photo. c'mon. Only parents care about stuff like that.     Favors are forgotten about or thrown in the trash. Seriously, I do not have one favor from any wedding I attended that was a memorable keepsake. They are a huge waste of money. People do not attend wedding so they can get a little tulle baggie full of almonds or a souvenir wine glass inscribed with another couple's names.  Favors are tacky and a waste of time and money.    You are right to forgo the favors in for something more worthwhile.     The charity thing is a  great idea because no money is going to waste.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Guests will not miss favors if you skip them. However donations should be given in private and kept that way. Your guests don't need or want to know that you donated money in their names (which then leads to worrying whether the charity will come after them in the future for further donations) to something that is clearly important to you. It's not something you are doing for them. When you announce it, even though it is not your intention, it does come across as "look at what we did!". There is nothing wrong with donating to a charity that is special to you but it has no place at a wedding.    And you most certainly never announce it in the invites, nor do ask guests to donate to your charity. That is highly rude and improper.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Since the donations are going to a charity, then I think it's a wonderful idea.  Just make a note or card or something in the programs that mention the opportunity to donate to these funds.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	I think that is a great idea.|`|5DJcir9saa	I think this a wonderful idea!  Especially since its in memory of your father.  I would just print up a little business card type thing that states, "in lieu of wedding favors we decided to make donations  to __________ in memory of the bride's father" and maybe even list where additional donations can be made in case they are interested.  Then set these out on the tables as if they were wedding favors.  Excellent idea and I'm sure you will get no complaints about the lack of wedding favors, since most people don't take them anyways.|`|662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	Sounds like a good idea.Make your own scrolls, it will be cheaper.|`|cGbTJobeaa	If you want to dontate money to a charity, then donate money to a charity.  You aren't required to have wedding favors. Most people probably would not even notice or care if there weren't jordan almonds or a tiny picture frame at their table setting.  You don't need a wedding as the impetus to donate money to charity. Donate money to charity because it's Thursday or the sun in shining.    I think it is interesting where couples say "instead of giving you some dinky little trinket to thank you for coming to our wedding, we are donating the money to charity."      Why is it that the guests have to be gypped out of a stupid little trinket so the couple may or may not (probably not) donate $25 to some charity?  Why isn't there a notation in the wedding program that says "in lieu of having her hair and nails professionally done, the bride is donating to $200 charity."  That probably would inspire more of a warm fuzzy feeling in the wedding guests than being told that you want everyone to know that you're socially aware and are donating money to a charity that isn't one of "their' causes|`|gKW1ufGbaa	My problem with it as a guest has always been that they say they gave a donation but who knows how much it was. For all I know it was $50 which would have been a lot less than the darn favors. They could just be trying to be cheap. My friend had little cards given to each guest printed that said a $5 donation would be made to the charity we checked off on the card and we were given a choice. I liked that better because guests were involved somehow. My husband worked at a charity with a great reputation and I can tell you a lot of donations went to employees drinking alcohol at Friday night happy hours and traveling first class instead of coach. Just give a token of appreciation to guests. How would you feel if they showed up empty handed to your wedding and claimed to have given your gift to charity. .|`|AA11138696	This is a new one to me but it sounds like an excellent idea.  You are right, why waste when the money spent could be of help to someone.  Maybe that is a new trend that might catch on.  You spend so much time and money on these favors and you are right.  Some sentimental folk like me do keep them but most people leave them behind or toss them later.|`|AA11380378	A favor is in nature a small token of appreciation/gift to the guests.A donation then is not a favor. In find these type of so-called favors extremely offensive as they have nothing to do with the guests.     People that are really philantrophic and caring do not use their wedding show showcase their donation and generosity to look good. It's not the place or the moment and it's in bad manners to discuss your donations with your guests as if they should know how good of a person you are. If you really care, donate privatly like a lady.     This is my experience. At a wedding that I attended, the bride and groom cut cortners everwhere. They donated as a favor to cut costs and look good at the same time which was extremely low class. They had a cash bar and also they had those so called donation favors. I was offended becase after spending $1500 on plane tickets, $800 on hotel accomodations $180 on car rental, $160 on tux rental, $50 on shower gift and $350 on their wedding gift, the least that they could do was to offer their guest a drink and a mint afterwards. They did the donation to cut costs as they had 200 guests and I doubt they donated more than $30    I say nay. Some people may find it offensive as it has nothing to to with their causes and it doest show appreciation to YOUR guests. Find other times to donate and be a lady and keep it to yourself. No advertisment is necesary when it comes from the heart.    Good luck|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	I have no personal experience with this, but I do believe it to be a wonderful idea.  I think your guests would understand and be touched by your sincerity.  I would think that an elegantly worded note left on the tables where the wedding favors normally would sit should serve the purpose just fine.|`|f9ca0489c84566012f6ae440195cf6b4aa	it's a great idea  make and print out your own notice or 'scroll' - it will only cost pennies  you could do a small business card note for each place setting or a larger (4X6 or 5X7 card) for each table|`|tZfkPQF6aa	I think this is an awesome idea! I wish that I had thought of it for my wedding.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Great idea!  Favors are very nice, but lets face it, they either get eaten or tossed!  Some ways to inform your guests are:  -sign at the gift table  -put it in the wedding program  -put it on each table with the table numbers  -put it in your speech when you are mentioning your dad (which I'm sure you will)    These are all cheap way of doing this and then you can give more money to the charity.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I have always loved this idea and plan on doing it at my own.    You can either write a short, meaningful note to place at each table or chair (ie: in lieu of favors, we have made a donation to such and such charities, blah blah blah), or you could make up a nice sign over by the guestbook or door so people can read it when they enter your reception.    Great move. :)|`|TfxJZl1eaa	Favors are something you give to your guest.  Now if you what to do the donating thing in lieu of gifts that's ok.     However a nice favor which I think people will keep is a nice book marker with your names and date on them and maybe  your picture you can find places or a person to do this for a low cost.  I had them made for my wedding and they were a big hit.  Also I had my hostess to pass out the favors and married couples got one.  I had pictures on mine so I needed to give one per couple. However ones with out pictures you can give out more and children do not need favors they tend to waste them.|`|8QOlaQWgaa	If you live in a state where they have lottery ticktes put lottery tickets on the table.  Not saying it is not a good idea, just throwing out favor ideas.  Please don't think I am being shallow.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I think this is a beautiful idea, and very classy. Why don't you make your own cards to let people know what you have done, you can put one by the gift table, and then just put on on each table, so you don't waste money you could be donating. You can get one made on hard cardstock a sign that sticks up from kinkos with beautiful writing on it. I would go that route. Oh and I am sorry for your loss. Good luck!

If you don't have an interest in him I would just let what he said go and go on as it never happened.|`|DHt8w4oFaa	no he aint stalking you!...he just wanted to let ya know he liked you|`|3fcccf19750497b4219fda41c7c3b8e3aa	He just likes you and wanted you to know! cause he feels he will never see You again he felt he could tell you and not be embarrassed or anything that's all!     I done that a couple of times to people i have liked and told them and never saw them again makes you feel a bit better!|`|rNiTscBVaa	no he ain no stalker so sto widshing you had one|`|8DeUoTs2aa	Sounds like you had an admirer from afar.  VERY different from a stalker!    Take it as a compliment, not a threat.    To actually be the victim of a stalker, is nothing at all -Nothing like what you describe here.  Stalking is serious Business!    Good Luck!
QV5E70e6aa	Good progress at this age.I think you should concentrate on study and should not enter into love field now.You should not worry about whether she loves you or not.Even this type of thinking will also effect your carrier.Just come out of all these and you will have a good girl in your life.|`|AA12016333	you can definitely love your mother; father; brother; sister; etc. why do you worry.   loving them will not spoil you or your studies.   good luck|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Of course you can love at any age. It's the last sentence that you'll have more trouble with, that and your parents' expectations.  Yes, you can allow yourself to wreck your grades by loving someone and spending time thinking about them, daydreaming, etc.  Can't stop your heart, friend.  Keep up your grades and study hard, let your heart go where it will and don't lie to yourself.  Will this relationship be THE ONE? Who knows?|`|AA11636892	you are a boy and your name is sujatha?? well either of this is false.    coming to your question, you are hardly 12 years old and you have to understand that its not love what you feel now. Its just attraction.. I can tell you this because almost everybody has fallen in love at this age and we all have grown out of it. So listen to me, there is a lot of time before you can commit to any relationship. just study well meantime|`|YB3cdx7Iaa	It is better to concentrate on yous studies Still you are small for this situation it is not love it is infatuation ,already she is in love with someone else why you are seeing her|`|HoKOAN7oaa	you are too young for it . it could be your crush.|`|VE7zH5Tfaa	Well let her go...

ImiMtrcqaa	Yes, men deal with things differently.  Not only that, each man deals with stuff differently than another would.   We tend not to forget anything and move forward a little faster because ot it.   In your case, the guy has learned something that he does not want to ever deal with again.  Therefore, does not respond to you at all.  You are now part of the past.       Right now, he is indifferent to your needs and has moved on.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	You dont know how he feels late at night... You dont know what he thinks. x    My advice is to leave it...read my question and you will understand why I say that. Dont waste years like I did|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Men Don't Ever Forget What has happened.    Men are built a little better for adversity. They have the ability to conquer emotions and move foreward in other areas of their lives. This mechanism is how they supress and compartmentalize their fears and hurt. They process the pain and in his case feel like he has failed you.     As ladies we have to learn how to operate this way in order to stay productive and make wise decisions. I used to be a basket case of emotions. I would be at work and think about something hurful and get carried away running to the bathroom crying. When I did this I appeared to be out of control.     I realize now that I control how I feel about the drama in my life. I am in the middle of a relationship that has gone wrong, In the process I can't allow it to make me lose my job argueing on the telephone etc. The relationship is secondary to me survival and my daughters welfare.       *****Call him admitt your wrong, commit to change and if he does not accept, chalk the experience up as a lesson learned.     I believe that too many people stay with people or force a relationship well beyond the season. They are supposed to be moving on but emotions make them stay.|`|ugcnq0Buaa	I am sure he still thinks about you, but then in another sense I think that if it seems that nothing is wrong with him and he is happy he probably never really loved you to begin with. SORRY!|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	men aren't normally as emotional as us women, and some of them have real trouble expressing their emotions, especially to another guy on Myspace or whatever, he isn't going to whine on there for everybody to see what a "wuss" he is.  I am sure he still thinks about you. Why don't you try to call him if you feel this way?  Good luck|`|nv4QV1OVaa	Guys deal with the same heartbreak that you do. However, pride and sensibility usually cause us to not let those feelings get the better of us. You've burned your bridge with him- time to move on.
AA11705978	Make him a handmade card, on the front    Remembering our times together...  (inside)  and missing them even more.    Happy Valentines & birthday,  Shanda|`|Id4PlUpaaa	Gift Nothing too much saying like I LOVE YOU , YOUR MINE NO ONES ELES!    something like Hey happy birthday!     xD|`|YxiCcUkDaa	I agree its time to move on.|`|TJMdmhckaa	yeah i think you should since your still friends.|`|F5R3TJEQaa	Move on|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	GO FOR IT! If you guys really care about each other then you should let no one stand in your way! Hes turning 18! I mean come on! I thinks hes old enough to make decisions for himself!  And if you want to  buy him a gift I say go for it! Just because your temporarily broken up doesnt mean that you cant show that you care for him!|`|VjV7W6qLaa	idk|`|hEcKmleVaa	I wouldn't try too hard.  A birthday/Valentine's card is appropriate.|`|vl8w7AtDaa	move on he's a momma's boy|`|5nqQLkbxaa	get him something really small but meaningful.  Go to Thornton's and you can get really nice individual chocolates wrapped up really cute.  just something to say you still care.    Also get him to tell his mum that he is an adult and he can have a girlfriend if he wants.|`|q3Fbkztbaa	yeh move on|`|cUgtkGdVaa	you should buy him both a bday and vday gift :]]|`|p7SAmSP6aa	Give him something little, like something you would give to any other kind of friend. Like a simple box of chocolates and a happy v-day card, opposed to a teddy bear or gushy stuff that has "i love you" all over it.|`|GWSFecsOaa	I'll say this and not to be mean. If the guy was serious about the relationship you guys had, his mother's opinion on you guys being together would be irrelevant. Don't get the guy anything. He could have not listened to his mom and still been with you. Be strong and move on. It may be tough, but you can do it.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	No, just wish him a nice friendly happy birthday if you happen to see him that day.  Do not go out of your way to see him or talk to him.  You clearly need to get over this break-up, & this is not helping.  Make plans to do things with your friends all day on Valentines - maybe host a "Black Hearts" sleepover or something.  Just stay busy so you don't have time to think about him.|`|9IQBarkbaa	I think you should! You didn't want to break up, his mom wanted you to break up! If you both hope you will get back together someday then I think he still cares about you.    I really think his mom doesn't have a right to say that you're both 17 and he's almost 18, what is the reason other then he's not allowed to have a girlfriend? If it's just that well that sucks, but there's nothing you can do about it since it's his mom.    Anyway I would buy a gift, but I wouldn't spend too much money. You can also do something like have a pick nick or something. Hope I helped :)|`|gj6rpPjYaa	Go ahead and buy gifts for him; not only on his birthday, but give him gifts from time to time. Send gifts also to his mum, dad and siblings. Be generous in giving. His mum didn't break you up, she just came between you. Your gifts will keep your relationship running and eventually shove her aside.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	actions speak louder than anything, and intuition is very important when trying to figure it out.sure sounds like there is something more than meets the eye here going on. a man u have to worry about and watch isn't worth having, they tend to be more trouble than what they are worth. and her reputation is telling.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	okay well if she is all up on him then i really don;t think that u should be weired about him be weired bout her i would just confront her bout the way shes been all up on him|`|e97047f84cabb9eb199ebb6f74ba94d5aa	Sounds like there is more to it than he wants to admit.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	By the sounds of it if it bothers you then just leave him.  He will not change and you will continue to be bothered by the situation if you stay with him.  If you've discussed this with him and he doesn't really care what you think or feel the answer of what to make of all of it is rather obvious...He doesn't respect or value your opinion.|`|JiMG2iYjaa	He shouldn't be offended if you say the truth about this girl.  He needs to be chose either you or her.  If not, then dump him b/c he needs to be more around you then her.  I don't see why he feels they have to be close anymore.  They are getting older and wiser not young and stupid.|`|xGshAiXOaa	A bikini covers much less than a t-shirt and panties.  She probably just has a very outgoing personality, and from the sound of it, you don't.  I doubt she was prancing around in her underwear to get your boyfriend's attention.  She might not see anything wrong with it, that it's not a big deal.  If your boyfriend and this woman have been friends for a long time, anything that you're worried might happen between the two probably would have already happened in their past.|`|z2ykc1Knaa	Have you really sat down and talked to your boyfriend about this? The thing about men is, they are complete morons unless you are willing to spell things out for them, even the most obvious of our hints can fall on deaf ears. Sit down, tell him how you feel and ask him to be honest with you. My boyfriend has other female friends and I have other guy friends. The reason we can hang out is because we have trust in the relationship. So you need to ask yourself 1)is there any reason you feel you can't trust your boyfriend? Any past reasons? 2)If you can't trust him, do you think you should be in a relationship with him?    And as for the beach it seems like all girls are running around in bikinis or something like that. Try talking to him calmly first, hint is calmly. Avoid accusing him of anything and just try to remain calm.
TCrV5hsyaa	Well consider this: If he was NOT cheating, then your question would have really hurt him..    If you didn't cheat, but your boyfriend demands that you prove it to him, how would you feel?    You would expect him to believe you, instead of listening to what other people say..|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Sounds like being a player is an art form to him, you can do better, you are worth more. Love yourself so that someone may love you for who you are in a sincere love.    Move on, you don't need him to feel better, all he does is make you feel sad.    Give love another chance, don't give jerks another chance...    Work out run, get into shape , hang out with guys , don't even have to date, just have the company and let it develop real.    He is needy, rude, and you can prob do better, let him get the message that its not ok to cheat on women.     Find someone better in life, someone who helps you through all of this, someone you can talk to , someone you don't feel pressured around .|`|hHndD5SEaa	jeez sorry to hear ye broke up!! But look at the end of the day - you didnt trust him - whether or not this was a valid judgement - I dont know - all I do know is that its very hard to be with someone that  you dont trust or have doubts about. Of course you're going to miss him - but you're just going to have to realise that theres better out there for you and that whats for you wont go past you  xx|`|qeVqBMVraa	well just do what makes u happy|`|d89qNyb6aa	You move on also hun.  Find your self a nice new man who will take care of you and treat you with the respect you deserve.Your motivation will soon come back ,I promise.|`|OOjNC1ETaa	Time is a great healer.  I don't think there is a quick cure for a hurt heart.  What you should do though (it works) is concentrate on something else.  Start running, get a new hairstyle, new clothes, go to the gym.  Plan a night out with your friends and invest in them and yourself - you'll feel better soon and probably meet someone else in the future.  Just try to look on the positive side - you are single!!!  Good luck :)
lFQiiR0Baa	If you miss them, you should talk to them. A simple Hello! is a good way to start a conversation, don't you think?  Remember that if you don't try, you'll be missing the opportunity to have your friends back.|`|clu2Ia4paa	i think u should start talking to them. start slowly by msn and then start talking to them at school. if they are worth it they u should give it a shot  hope i helped :)

You have to ask your boyfriend what his intentions are; ask him all the important questions that your brother mentioned and you should be able to hear it in his voice if it is true or not. If he is truly a good man, he should only tell the truth - and you will hear it in his voice. But you really have to listen, not just with you heart but really listen with your ears; if there is the slightest doubt in your mind if he is true to you or not than you need to make a choice.    I am not saying he is lying to you, but please make sure you make the right choice for YOU. Not your boyfriend, not your brother, but you! In the end, blood is thicker than water and you NEED your family in your life. I really wish you luck on this, I can only imagine how bad it must make you feel.     Good luck girl!|`|yXHUINHSaa	JUst do what you want.|`|JfQPVwjMaa	Listen toyr bother n just forget(try to) him otherwise u will repent.|`|McfQdMZuaa	I understand brothers are always more protective for their sisters,  and I understand your situations too, you says your BF is really handsome, and got gorgeous girls in the past, and you accepting that you are not that looking good,   So point is if he has been with gorgeous girls then how could you trust him? And how can you trust that he will not going to do again? You have just became attracted to him, thats all it,   Ok my opinion is give sometime to your relationship, dont make a rush, and keep trying to know him more, (with different testing) if you feel 100% sure with everything then you can go ahead and some good decision.  but in further time if you caught him with something of your brothers was told you then, kick him out, and you are looking natured so you will have someone nice person in your life who have made just for you, dont make a rush for anything,  keep in my EVERYTHING HAVE BEHIND SOME REASON, you met him there is some reason, you both are fall in love there are some reason, and YOUR brother was told you and bewared  you there are also some reason,   In our culture we have to think about our parents and other family members before we made some decision,  All I can say is take your time, dont be RUSH    Best of luck natured girl  god be with you......:)|`|QqY8YgGDaa	-You can tell to private detective to obseve your bf  -your feeling may not be correct  -You and your brother should prepare,simple ,low cost,rough   lie detector and use it to test your bf  -Old method -Your brother can study palmistry and learn to find the character of person .this is simple and cheap-You or your brother can write e mails to me by clicking my profile  -|`|xdvsXz40aa	Go get a rope and hang yourself!!!|`|5r48jn7iaa	don't listen to your brother, not all guys f*** and leave girls. and long distance relationships can work! but you have to trust your bf. and don't tell him what your brother has been saying. just let your brother know you appreciate his concern but you like this guy and he doesn't get a vote.|`|r8ozJABSaa	Whoa i feel bad :[    but i should trust ur brother, anyways he is a guy and i have been through the same, i trusted a guuy like u did and it turned out all he did care about wuz fckin....so trust ur brother and if u dont at least ask ur "bf" questions to mayb get more information out of him|`|52SuTquxaa	believe your brother but do not suspect  your BF just discuss this with elders as if anything happens they'll be with you|`|WJOp1xgraa	tell your brother that you dont think he does that because he senn like a nice guy but still like be carefull and keep the eye out for him doe u can never be 2 carefull :)|`|AA10883009	If I were you,I would listen to brothers advise.You see guys on the net are basically there to trap gals like you and sites like Orkut-God save all.Its just your age and the hormones that has turned you blind.How can one fall in luv without seeing,knowing about the character, traits, temperament etc of other.Jus having Chat and being friend does'nt mean luv.I know however one convinces you wont be convinced.So be sensible and act.Lest you repent for rest of your life.|`|KOSuw0Bkaa	I think u should listen to ur brother.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Parties married abroad in a foreign country but got the marriage registered according to the Indian Matrimonial laws most probably under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 in India. They have already obtained decree of divorce in a foreign country, most probably in the same country they originally got married. In this case there is no need of obtaining another decree of divorce from India as the marriage in question if has been dissolved by the decree of divorce by a court of competent jurisdiction of the place where the marriage was solemnized & covered under the competent matrimonial law of the country. The marriages which are originally solemnized in India according to the Indian Statute will require to be dissolved according to the Act under which these were solemnized & registered as that Act provides territorial jurisdiction to Indian courts to adjudicate any dispute including dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce or annulment as the case may be, but since this marriage was registered both in the foreign country where it was solemnized as well in India hence courts of both countries had territorial jurisdictions to adjudicate the dispute between the parties, when one court of a country has already adjudicated this dispute amongst the parties then they need not get another court of another country to rehear & adjudicate the same dispute between them once again, more so the principle of res judicata will debar any such proceedings once again to be heard & adjudicated which has been finally decided between the parties & legally bind them as this decree of divorce they got from the foreign court of the country where they originally got married. For further discussion & consultancy on this issue, the complete papers relating to the case have to be examined & further confirm the legal position I have briefly discussed here in this forum.
cTYAYrb9aa	I had this happen to me., but it was on a slightly different matter. My best friend decided to go and tell something I trusted her not too say to everyone else - and it hurt.    She tried to make it up, saying she was sorry and asking if I would forgive her, but I had to say no. I mean, I still loved her (we were friends for ages) but she had hurt me so badly that I didn't want to talk to her anymore and knew that, if we became friends again it wouldn't be the same. I wouldn't trust her, we wouldn't have as much fun and what she did would always be in the back of my head.     I hope that I gave you a little insight into what your friend is feeling. If like me, she might just want to be left alone.    I hope it works out for you.    X|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think the best thing you can do to win her over again is to continue to call her.

He'll probably start crying or ask u why.  If he starts crying just sat that you're sorry but you don't love him anymore and leave. If he asks you why tell him how you feel of him being so emotional. You might find a way to work it out.|`|fYnSilr7aa	Drop him!! It's not like he is your bf right? Yall just went on a date!

nDSLNnguaa	Ok, first of all, nobody can FORCE you back.  Her behavior is manipulating you back which seems in context with the rest of her behavior.  I'm all about second chances if someone deserves them (of course cheating doesn't ever deserve a second chance in my opinion) but just because she didn't tell you everything about her past doesn't mean she can't be trusted.    You need to do what you feel is right. Be there for her through this but be honest with her and yourself.  Don't let her manipulate you into going back.  Go back only if she is what you really want!|`|ccf98ef34d5d68794cbb95fc1994faf3aa	Only you can answer that question. Everything you said would be personal preference. Where I live it's extremely uncommon to wait until marriage for sex. Where you are may be different based on religious and social values. If you felt it was the right decision, then for you it was.     Don't let her try to force you back into a relationship by not taking care of herself. Be there to support her but don't base your decisions on her actions.|`|id29mxMYaa	Well, if she's forcing you back, don't let her. One thing that you do not want is a woman who is forcing you back with her. Another thing is, that if she's dating a married man, then dont go back with her. She's obvisouly a succubus, cheating on other men. See whats happened to you? She stoled your emotions and left you with guilt. Dont worry about guilt. Guilt is a big emotion that no one likes, beiside you'll get over it in about a week or so. Lemme tell you somethin, relax for awhile, do not go out with another woman for at least a month or 3 weeks. Trust me on this. But dude theres other fish in the sea for you. She was just a small herring.|`|6NPgEosOaa	Hey, i can understand you're pretty upset she had an affiar with a married man before, but maybe she was young and naive at that time. people make mistakes all the time. nobodys perfect. MAybe at that time, she had a sever misjudgment, but you cant blame somebody for their past if you truly loved them. HOw bout YOURSELF, are YOU perfect? IS your past perfecT?    Why are you so angry>? IS it because you feel that her values clash with yours because she was a mistress before? Maturity and wealth can be very attractive for young girls, and sometimes these 'security' promises can mislead a girl into thinking that they really love this man. Especially since she has no father figure in her life. Older men can therefore be seen as a 'replacement', a father she never had.    So she probably made a mistake then. most importanly, has she learnt from that mistake?? does she stil think wealth is that important?does she know that having an affair with a married man is wrong?? If shes with you now, and you have nothing. then i think you should forgive her. After all surely there was something about her there before, other qualities taht should compensate for just this ONE thing in her past.    DO you love her? If you do, then ask her why she did waht she did, If she's truly sorry about her past amd she says she loves you, then i dont think you shud break up.    also theres nothing wrong with her hiding it from you before. SHe probably liked you so much, she feared telling you will cause u to dislike her, which is indeed the case.also, she was prob to ashamed about it to tell you. if her actions, up until now has given you no reason to suspect her, theres no reason why you can not trust her ever again in the future.|`|IuQxATzlaa	wow thats tough however, i believe that trust is a vital component of every relationship that's why one should truly preserve it and never ruin it coz like glass, once broken, it will be so impossible to have it back.   still, its your decision to end the relationship and you have basis for it. the question is, do you still love her? if yes, how much can you take to trust her again?   If she is forcing you to be back, then she is being selfish. not eating properly? she might be manipulating you. if two people are in a relationship, its because they have love and commitment for each other and not because they feel guilty about it. so think about it.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Never trust a hoe|`|teisU4E2aa	You dont need to worry about it anymore she made her bed now she has to sleep in it?

U need to have clear thoughts. Do some self talk to yourself and decide whether u want to have him or u want to see someone else.   Spend some time alone and decide on it.  God Bless!

fUBWB88laa	Maggie Sottero has some very gorgeus pink wedding dresses...here is a link for you:    http://www.maggiesottero.com/collection....    I typed in "pink" in the search engine and there are two pages of dresses that can come in the color pink. You just have to look through them.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Ebay|`|ge3meKYEaa	David's bridal had like 6 of them last time I was in there- so cute!|`|I3V7hE32aa	Mia and Bubbles have great answers.  I'd also like to suggest that you look at bridesmaid's dresses, since they come in so many color options.  You may be able to find a style that you like in the color you want.|`|RmIeoU7raa	Try looking at formal dress in department stores.  That's where I bought my dress.  Usually they have dresses that look like wedding dresses, but of course aren't, in many different colors.  They seem to be much cheaper than bridal stores in my opinion.|`|h0rsT8Tlaa	Try looking at the Sophia Tolli line of dresses, she has many that come in a light pink colour, or with pink highlights or embroidering. Her dresses are around $1000 new, but you could find them cheaper second hand.
nxHjSKTTaa	Yes, marriage would be of great benefit for your case.  I know about custody battles.  The courts are not just going to hand over this kid to the ex, so you don't have to worry about that.  They may just start with small douses of visitation to see how consistent he is there.  Don't waste any time getting married, trust me on that. Good luck!|`|63oSbqZlaa	whose last name does the baby have?  Marriage can't hurt anything but living together might in some states. has there been dna testing, for sure fight this if you think the baby should not go to him. This could be tied uup in court a long time, but normally if he is not just scum of the earth a judge will order at least visitation and a child support order.    If there will be dna testing, make him pay because he's the one who has something to proove not you guys...maybe he wont because of the cost of that and a lawyer and all the court costs and crap. if you have proof of his crappy life style keep a journal or something to document all the bad you know--a judge wont care alot about moving around- unless the moving is from getting kicked out for not paying the rent--and then it only goes to show his shotty character|`|bDyuH1YFaa	I know that your feeling very anxious but depending on the laws in your country you don't really have a leg to stand on (married) or not...  If this person is prov en to be the biological father of the child, keeps up maintenance payments then he has every right to see his child.  If you fear for you child's well being (as stated) you can only hire a good representative to present your case to the court system.  No system would intentionally place a child in the care of someone that is not found to be Fit to care for a child.  I understand that you and your partner are raising this child together and that is fantastic, however at the end of the day if her biological father wants to see her. He has a right.  You don't want your daughter to grow up resenting you both as parents, no child deserves to have someone keep them from a parent.  If you get married or not, it will not change the FACT that this guy is the biological father.  Good Luck and I feel for you.  Take care.|`|SjH4S5Csaa	Firstly, given that guy's nomadic lifestyle, moving from place to place, he probably wouldn't get custody, visiting rights maybe but not custody.    Secondly, marriage is very seriouse comitment, and if you really believe those vows you will take, then consider the ramifacations, are you both prepared to forsake all others, is your girlfriend ever going to have another short term affair?...and the list goes on.  In my humble opinion, no one should ever get married because of circumstance or situation, be it for the sake of a child or financial gain...the only people who should get married are those who are totally commted to each other and take their vows seriously.    Anyway, the choice is yours ultimatley and I am married (happily) so I know what it'slike to commit to those vows seriously.  Marriage is deffinatly not a tool of convienience or anything else for that matter.

Just would you go?  There are people out there just waiting to take advantage of you.  Take one day at a time and you will make it.  You are a young person and you have to decide on what you want to do in your future.  Try to get a good education and when you do you can write your own ticket to life.  Good luck|`|d1wXxd9paa	Darling... Depression is a very serious thing.  It is something not to be ashamed or embarassed of.  If there is something serious bothering you at school or home you need to speak to someone.  Go to your guidance counsellor, your family doctor or even a teacher.  When your 15 life is supposed to be carefree and fun.  I know society these days doesn't make it easy but try to be you and really go talk to someone.  You have so much to live for in the future.
rcArdzhdaa	do something to convert your attention  have fun, go somewhere  change your daily routine   make friends or make new love  although its hard but the still you are the only one who can control yourself  its up to you if you want to move on or you want to stay as you are  remember you can control yourself and not that person can control you|`|fDhOFwX9aa	Not to say forget him. He is part of your life since you love him for so long although he never love you. But I am sure that you enjoy loving him. It just that the reality is you have to move on to the next chapter of your life. I am sure that you also know that continue loving him will bring you no where and therefore you had to let it go. You can live a new life. Let him go. Wish him to be happy in his life, if you love him.Because you want him to be happy and you will feel happy for him. As you said, he was your life. Let the past stay at the past.|`|bZud91iuaa	Stop whining and go find some other friends.  If he hasn't talked to you in a year, what does that tell you?  And you left him remember, what did you expect? I'd also get some help for your obsessive compulsive behavior from a professional instead of listening to a bunch of armchair psychologists like us.|`|eqaUMrYZaa	Stand out in front of his place like this.............  http://www.cbc.ca/arts/images/pics/cusac...    Works everytime.    Seriously you need mental help.|`|U1e7wJgYaa	girl find another lover it as simple as that|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	My goodness! Thats just.. a little obsessive. Just a tad? Maybe you should date other people. And maybe one day he'll run into you and see your seeing someone else and moved on. But don't depend on that.  Seriously, this whole circle of emotions seems a bit toxic. Maybe you could find time to do something else to put all that energy into. I try to forget things and move forward. If someone doesn't love me when I love them I don't beat myself up about it and even though I love them I know I can't have them. So I just forget about it, and just cherish the things we used to be. But whatever, life goes on. Theres other lovers.|`|mbeniuLqaa	ohhh.... girl..........    you dont have to move on.....    what u need to do is try to talk to him if you know its your fault then try to fix things up.Dont let any unexplainable reason ruin your relationship. Try to fix things and you'll see everything will be fine and normal and both of you will be happy.    the main solution was for the both of you to talk ok? so better have a good conversation :)    tell me what happened ok? hope id help :)|`|FROVo8WWaa	that is sad...honestly. try fn someone else.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	You are just hurting yourself by hanging on to something that obviously is never going to be.  You need to move on and find someone else who can make you forget him.  It seems hard and impossible at the moment but you are letting him consume your life.  It's time to let go.|`|p7SAmSP6aa	If letting him go is something that you don't want to do why ae you going to force yourself do so?  Have you taken the chance  to try to talk to him in person or on the phone and see what ever happened to you or how he even feels about the situation?    I think you should talk to him first and if from that you can see that he really just wants nothing to do with you, should you then start worrying about forgetting him.|`|BJwhdvjoaa	Cut him loose if you're loving someone who doesn't love you its going to hold you back might even hurt you're relationships in the future let him go find somebody that can love past what he did. Good Luck|`|71EubY7maa	I know it must be very hard for you.In this case, I think you should hang out with other people and try other activities, like dancing,singing,painting,gardening,readi... or anything you like . Go watch movies,socialise with people, focus more on your courier,keep distance from him and move on.|`|dj8ofPtgaa	Careful with your emotions as they can be misleading. Is it lust that drives you or the you want what you cant have factor. Or is it fear of letting go and knowing that he will never be in your life. Or that you love him 'why doesnt he feel the same way'. Its ok not to forget but its safe to move on. Another man will occupy your heart soon dont worry.|`|yRRnbNqXaa	Well, why don't you tell him all this? Or write it in a letter or e-mail if you can't talk to him in person... Tell him how you've been feeling and that you made a terrible mistake, explain that you don't know why you did what you did and ask him if could talk about it. You might not get back together after it, but at least you'll get it off your chest and you could remain at least friends if he'll want that.     When people break up, in my opinion, the most difficult thing is not knowing what exactly happened. If you tell him how you feel and he doesn't want to ge back together, you'll at least get a closure, you'll know that you've done all you could do and the rest isn't in your hands anymore. If you have no regrets and "what if"s, you'll be able to get over him much faster too.. Good luck

No need to be phony.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	People like to feel like they are important.  Notice something about her and ask about it.  New shoes?  jeans?

xGshAiXOaa	If you love him enough to marry him, why does this matter?  Money comes and goes.  If it is that big of a deal for you, tell him you would like for it to be paid off before the wedding.|`|SsfnitjXaa	As long as his poor judgment does not flow over into other areas I would say the $4,000 is not big deal.      Although personally I would never marry anyone that lived with another woman so long and did not marry her.    If you marry him simply help him pay off the money owed and get on with your life.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	If you're debating marrying this man based upon him owing the IRS 4000 dollars...maybe it should be him debating marrying you.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	file separately and  make sure he is making payments on time|`|I814g6ZBaa	Wait until he fixes his messes... dig DEEP -- there are probably more of them.  Then IF you marry him, always keep a wary eye; he might be the type who just can't help but fall into these kind of stupid situations...   Just sayin!!!    Good luck, Sweetie!!  :)|`|8txWayVnaa	That's a red flag, in my opinion.  Not saying you shouldn't marry him, but you should definitely look at the way he handles his other finances.  Either wait until he cleans up his mess, or file separately after you marry.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I don't see how that has anything to do with getting married. I would say get married you can always file separate and it you don't then they will take it out of his taxes at the end of the year until the taxes are paid in full. You love with your heart but your bank account.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	If you marry him the IRS has a right to seize all of your assets (bank accounts, any owned property) to pay his debt. So in answer to your question NO do not marry him yet.     On a side note you might want to really reconsider this relationship if he is willing to be that dishonest.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No - they won't come after you if you are married.  When tax time comes you can file an "injured spouse" form.  They will return your taxes - but not his.  My husband had a small debt he owed to the IRS (unbeknown to me!) and I had to file that form to get my money back.  It wasn't difficult...it also didn't take that much longer than normal filing - but it isn't as fast to process as the electronic returns.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I don't really think 4000 is A LOT of money. I mean, he could pay in back within a year or 2 couldn't he? If not, don't marry him for that reason.|`|AA12110218	worry less about the money and more about the honesty of your fiance     big red flag - find someone else to marry|`|JiMG2iYjaa	If he lied about this, no telling what else you don't know about he isn't telling you.  Watch your back if I was you.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	$4000 is not a great amount.  I owe more than that and my husband still married me.  When I questioned him on it before we were married, he just stated "Honey, we'll take care of it."  He loves me enough to take on the burden and help me get it taken care of.  Marriage to me meant more to him than any amount of money.  He is an absolute prince!|`|AA10031161	Did he know at the time that the child wasn't his? If so, I'd kick his lying trash to the curb! Dishonesty is soooo unattractive!    That aside, I would try to avoid, (as much as possible), anything that may link you two financially- checking or savings accounts, loans, rental agreements, and especially filing of taxes ! ! !    If he has a payment arrangement with the IRS, make sure he's consistently making his payments on time.    Marriage? That's up to you. Marriage is more than a love issue... it involves finances, personalities and temperaments, tons of logistics (especially in a case, where children are involved)....    There are a lot of things to consider when the issue of marriage comes up. You've asked three questions about this, just this morning.    I suggest you and BF sit down and discuss all the aspects of your relationship- finances, temper, financial self-control, child discipline philosophies, religion and ethics, hopes and dreams, goals, etc. Make sure these are all compatible before you even think about setting a date or start making plans/arrangements for a wedding.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	My husband and i just had to file injured spouse last week.Yes it takes longer but its worth it because then your taxes are not effected by any of it.They can not come after you for it because its not your debt.Of course you should still marry him.|`|bIimm8fSaa	Yes, you should still marry him.  He made an honest mistake.  Maybe he thought he could claim her if they were living with him.  As for you getting your return back.  You do not have to file the injured spouse, just file separately.|`|xNF04OfJaa	What until all his dues are paid, so you don't have to deal with the hassle.|`|p6QizgmRaa	File separately after marriage. But either way, in the long run, it will still effect your household income one way or another. He really doesn't owe that much. If you truly love him and want to spend the rest of your life with him, I would suggest you discuss any other irresponsible things he may have lingering around. Base your decision on that.|`|e97047f84cabb9eb199ebb6f74ba94d5aa	If you file married filing seperately you won't be held liable for his tax burden.  It will however affect you because he will have to pay it back and they will be money out of the income that will be used for that purpose.|`|AA10010935	I don't know the answer to that.  But I do know that I wouldn't marry someone who owes a lot of money to the IRS.  You need to think about that.|`|11e186f736d5369cde4eaaf76595f3f7aa	Why not? He might end up with a government appointed position in Washington.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	after betrayal the one betrayed looses their sense of security, u don't see that person in the same light anymore. but if he is remorseful, and is willing to go to therapy, and acknowledge that he understands what he did hurt u then its better to try to work it out if at all possible. some people can forgive some can't. just keep your eyes and ears open and listen to your intuition, it tells us allot of things we wouldn't normally know.if u leave u leave the door wide open for this homewrecker to gain acess to your husband. the main thing u have to look at is if the marriage is a good oneand if up until now u have been happy. if so u would want to chose to try and keep it together, if its not a good marriage, and there isn't anything to save, then u might want to file for divorce.|`|cd87288852b5c01e64c902f0433720abaa	Hey... I am in the exactly same situation, but for me, he cheated while I was expecting our first baby!, he said that he never kissed her, that it was only a phone thing where they talked at all hours of the night. But I don't know what to believe anymore. Forgiveness is a Des. something that only you can decide if it will happen. Look for signs of him being sorry, if he doesn't change then you have your answer. I know is hard, I wasn't even married a year when he started cheating, but we have kids and we need to do what's best for  them. We can't be in a unhealthy relationship or in a relationship where everyday we think about what our husband did to us. The person here that needs to be thinking things over is him and he needs to figure out how to get your trust back.  So Good luck, I know how you are feeling. Is not a good place to be in right now, but you have the power to resolve this.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I believe kissing can be forgiven, but unfortunately you will never be able to forget and things will never be the same because you have lost some love for him (at the moment probably not feeling any love towards him).      At lease he didn't put it in her, and now that her hubby knows (good move in clueing him in) I bet they won't be smooching anymore.    Best to ask him why he felt the need to do this, if that problem is not face he will just do it again with someone else.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry but I think that once someone cheats there is no way the marriage will work out. You can never trust another word that comes out of his mouth. Even though he didn't have sex with the person doesn't mean he didn't really cheat. I call that cheating. I also believe once a cheater always a cheater. If it was my husband I would kick him out. When he is gone to work change the locks on the doors and sit his stuff in a trash bag outside.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Only you know what to do.  First, try to calm down.  Think all the things he has done for you, for this marriage, and for your 2 children.  As long as he still loves you and you still love him, I think you should give him a second chance.  Do whatever feel right.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Ok, you need to take a breath first of all.    You know you still love him and you know you want things to work out.  By no means am I condoning what he did and yes hes a huge jerk for letting this happen.    I do believe you can salvage thing at this point but he needs to be clear that you are in the drivers seat and he pretty much needs to kiss your butt until the trust can be regained.    The two of you need to figure out how things got to this point and work on them.  Im not saying it will be easy but so many times in life the best things arent so easy.    It may take counselling and lots of tears but i believe there is always hope.    Below you can find some great relationship articles that may just help you on your journey.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Forgiveness is a choice!    You will have to put some of your wishes aside and look past the ideal that most of us have about relationships. Deal breakers will happen, people ar imperfect. The only way to restore this marriage will be a lot of courage from you. Allow him to know that this is the biggest deal breaker and that he is on very thin ice. Maturity will have to step in and the future of your children will have to be put first.     If he is a Good Father and Husband aside from this mistake than no you don't throw him away like other people have said.|`|20LnuCejaa	You have to decide if you ever want to trust him again.  If you want to make it work, he needs to PROVE to you over a long time that he can be trusted.  He does not gain trust automatically by saying he is sorry.  Seeing a counselor would be good.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	If you feel betrayed after kissing a co-worker and can't come to terms with it I don't see how you can forgive him and move on.  It seems you have alot to sort out with your husband and if it's based on only their kissing and his text messages you should begin practicing forgiveness and he should brace himself for a painful spiteful divorce.|`|n1AAHi5qaa	I can't tell you how to move on.  Something you will have to figure out on your own.  But to all the people that say your marriage is over once someone cheats...they are wrong.  Yes, a lot of marriages are over once this happens.  But not all of them.  Some stay together and are happier than before.  I would try to find out exactly what happened between them so you know what you are dealing with.  You can pretty much tell how it's going to work out when the two of you talk.  If he seems sorry for what he did and is willing to be honest and up front about everything, doesn't hold anything back then it may work.  If he seems like he doesn't really care, doesn't really want to talk about it, tries to pawn it off or avoid the subject, then it probably won't.  Hope whatever happens is what is best for you.  Good luck|`|RdHED7Yhaa	First of all you acted very immature by going to her and her husband.  Your problem is with your mate and him alone.  She put her lips up and he put his up to. However, the kiss would not have taken place without his lips. Now stop just thinking about yourself and think about your kids.  Get over it it was a kiss. Were  you a virgin when you met The odds are no.  Marriage is more than sex and unless he continues to act in this manner or is unwilling to change. Other words you need to get over it and move on.  Figure out what you need to work on in your sexual relationship with your husband. So he will keep his kissing at home.|`|ugcnq0Buaa	It has been almost 3 years since I cheated on my husband. I didn't have sex just some other stuff. Our marriage wasn't the best. There was verbal abuse and some physical abuse on his side. But that is no excuse to do what I did. To this day I still feel like **** about it. I don't know how my husband could forgive me, because if the tables were turned I don't think I could! But you know something my husband would have never knew if I didn't have a guilty conscience. I couldn't just carry on and not feel like ****! How can you do that and at the same time look that person square in the face! just because you have been together for a long time and have kids I would keep your eyes OPEN! Forgive him. If he does it again leave him. If you truly do forgive your husband you are not supposed to bring it up again or let it bother you, because if your doing that you never really forgave him to beign with! I know its hard! GOOD LUCK!|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	as for the main question how is the relationship after someone cheats! my answer is non exsistant!  period!      Now let me read your details!   I am not asking for pitty or rude comments please.  " i never try to be rude but how you preseve  things is different then me so sorry in advance you know my intent is to help not to hurt"    one moves on from betrail by focusing on what they want NEXT out of life!  goals, careeer, new relationship, healthier friendships, time alone!  or what ever!  as long as it's not focusin on what if's what could of been or how things were!   if you do that you'll never move on!     It sucks when everythign you thougth you had is flipped up side down!  and as much as im pro working things out in a marriage i dn't like divorses!  Cheating is the deal breaker!  Now they say 7 years with one person makes another sort of want to stray!  but i think that BS!     i noticed you called her a B *** well he is a D*** it takes 2 to tangle and she isn't to blame as much as he is!    first  off why did he put himself in a sisutation where he could cheat!       but what you need to do now is ask yourself!  don't answer to anyone but yourself!   Can you still give him 100% trust ever again? if you THINK you can what would he have to do? if you can't answer this question then i'm sorry it's time to move on!   but please for the kids sake leave on good terms not bad ones!|`|tCI8ksvdaa	This is the problem when trust is broken.  You never know if he is lying and was he unfaithful with one woman or with twenty!  You will never know so what happens is you must make a choice.  You must choose to live with this feeling or to get a divorce with the chance of finding a man you can trust.|`|xNF04OfJaa	You are thinking right you need to leave him, That's nasty and trifling   If they didn't have sex yet it was eventually going to happen. Then the thought of them being married, WOW! No respect, Why do people get married if they are going to do dumb ****. They both need their a** beat! Big time! Beat his M*** F**** in a** girl!      BEAT HIS A**|`|IOXBuE58aa	My wife is cheating on me or was not totally sure if she stopped, i feel your pain. Basically i just told my wife that she needed to stop seeing her co-worker NOW! Stop going to lunch with him, stop talking to him when not at work or about non related work issues.    If he truely is sorry, he'll stop talking to her.  Also, you have to look at what caused him to look else where for passion or attention. Woman sometimes forget what they have at home and blame it on hormones or mentapause (SP).  Marriage is a two way street and if he helps out with chores, treats you good, helps with kids then dont forget about his needs emotionally and sexually, even though u may not "FEEL LIKE IT".  A man needs to know he is wanted and desired too.|`|Cc1dTfQ4aa	There are always three sides to every story.  Yours, his and the truth.  Why would he look elsewhere for affection?  Maybe you are giving him what he needs, and maybe not.  This could be the best thing for your marriage.  A wake up call for both of you.  Be honest with each other to see what is going on.  If you can't work it out, see a counselor.  You owe it to yourselves and your children.|`|BMD6ybz2aa	well im not saying what your husband did was right.but are you planning to leave this marriage because you want to or is it because you are angry and you feel "betrayed" you said that you have two kids.before you leave think of them, you don't want  your kids to grow in a broken family only because of one stupid mistake.like you said your husbands co-worker is married and im sure her husband wont leave her.if you feel that you cant work your marriage out by your selves "including your husband" speak to a family elder even better go see marriage councilor if that does not work then you can leave your marriage knowing that you have tried saving it rather than leaving without trying.     i hope all works out for the best...|`|OntO6wE4aa	Fresh cuts hurt, but they do hurt. Give yourself time and if you really need it - alittle space. Let the anger calm then make decisions on what you want to do. Don't end the marriage. Not trying to sound as if I'm siding with your man, cause he was wrong. Just think of how much time he spends with his co-workers then you. You can  become closer to who you with the most. For some reason he forgot he was married. If you stay start setting rules. Make sure he focuses on all your needs, then he won't have time to be kissing people at work. Don't let him get away with I'm sorry.|`|2NUJsWIoaa	I Feel really sorry for all your pain and hurt but I  wouldn't start telling anybody just yet! You can recover from this but be prepared to find out that he has had sex with her! HE SOUNDS LIKE HE IS UTTERLY REMORSEFUL AND REGRETTING HIS ACTIONS NOW. He wants to save his marriage and realises his mistake!  I have been in the same situation and my husband totally denied anything but a kiss at first.     You need to go to the website  www.survivinginfidelity.com    It is a great place to start rebuilding your marriage. You are going through hell but please remember NONE  of his was your fault!!!    ALL THE BEST|`|4YjsxXnjaa	Look dear lady, I understand that you are distressed with anger and hate as you feel betrayed . I hope that you are indian as i could expect   an subdued and domicile attitude from you.Learn to give few events an blind eye as it takes you no where.Men are biologically destined to have sex with many other females.You remain in your faith towards him and get him to an understanding that you are very tolerant and respect the relationship as you think it accounts your life . 5 years is not a very long period in maried life .It is much bigger journey that you have to sail through may be 40+ and then you realize the importance fo your husband.It is up to you,require to be more intellegent and smart.  If your husband has any plans to abandon the relationship between both you and then take you for a ride then you would have to deal with police nd perhaps the best choice would be your parents,how ever do not remain contained with the thaught that you are betrayed and cheated as every man does with a special importance to his wife  Including me.   Hope i did not hurt you.
IbhX8kHxaa	I copied this from another answer here on Y!A    Box, Wine & Love Letter Ceremony"    While there are so many traditions that a couple can incorporate into their  wedding vows, such as the Unity Candle, The Rose Exchange, and many more, there is one special idea that I have recently learned about from my dear friend, Richard (Thanks Rich!) who attended a wedding in Holland. While he was not sure if it was a Dutch tradition, he found it to be extremely touching. When he returned to the states, he could not wait to share this with me. Basically the JP or officiant asks the couple getting married to find a strong wooden box that will hold two bottles of wine and two wine glasses. The couple is then asked to each write a letter to one another, expressing their thoughts about the good qualities that they found in their future partner and their reasons for falling in love with each other. Under no condition can they read each others letter. They are to seal them and put them in the box with the wine and glasses. Upon finalizing the wedding ceremony, the officiant will announce to the guests that he / she had asked the couple to write letters to each other and put them in the box with the wine and glasses. The officiant will explain that should the couple ever find their marriage in serious trouble, before making any irrational  decisions, they must open the box, drink wine together, and read the letter that they wrote to one another to reflect on why they fell in love with each other in the first place. The hope is that there will never be a reason to have to open the box, unless of course, it is for a 25 year anniversary! At the wedding in Holland, members of the wedding party were handed nails to hammer (which I dress up with a white ribbon and bow) the box shut. However, as an alternative, I suggest that it be the couple to each take a nail and hammer the box shut (with two pre-drilled holes to make it easier to hammer), if only to add that special touchinto their wedding vows. This is only a suggestion, but I just think that it makes the ceremony extra special for the couple.    Truthfully, I find this to be the most romantic (and coolest!) addition to  incorporate into a marriage ceremony. Not that my husband and I needed to do this (well o.k., maybe sometimes!), but I wish that we had. It would have been fun opening it up on our 25th Anniversary!    The Officiant would say the following:    "Alexis & Travis, I have asked you as a couple, to find a strong wooden box that will hold two bottles of wine, and two wine glasses. In addition, I have asked each of you to write a letter to one another, expressing your thoughts about the good qualities that you have found in your future partner, as well as, your reasons for falling in love with each other. I requested that under no condition were you to read each others letter, and that you were to seal them in individual envelopes and put them in the box with the wine and glasses."    "Alexis & Travis, should you ever find your marriage enduring serious  difficulties, I am asking that before you make any irrational decisions, that you both, as a couple, open the box, drink some wine together, and then venture off into separates rooms to read the letters that you wrote to one another when you were united as a couple. By reading these love letters, you will reflect upon the reasons that you fell in love with each other in the first place. The hope here is, that there will never be a reason for you to open this box, unless of course, it is for your 25 year anniversary!"  "Alexis & Travis, I now ask that each of you take a nail, one at a time, and hammer the box shut."      I hope you like this idea! and God Bless your marriage!!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Our pastor doesn't let the candles be blown out until the ceremony is over.  He also doesn't have us blow out the single candles because symbolically it might give someone the idea that the individuals are gone and there's only 1 when in reality we are still individuals and are creating a relationship together.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	We bought an oil lamp to use as our unity candle, so we can use it over and over again.

nDSLNnguaa	It's best not to expect anything. That way you'll be pleasantly surprised if he gets you one but you won't be disappointed if he doesn't!    That's all I got. =D|`|YAZBFnAIaa	probably. get him one too just incase. but dont give it to him right away, wait until he gives you your present(if there is one) and then give him his. if you just give it to him, and he doesn't have one for you, that'll make him feel terrible.|`|v9QXlYDQaa	My friend started going out with a guy the day before valentines day, and he got her a box of chocolates.|`|ccf98ef34d5d68794cbb95fc1994faf3aa	If it's that new into the relationship I wouldn't expect a gift, but I would expect dinner or a nice evening together.    You may want to ask him if he would like to exchange gifts. He won't be offended and it will also give you the chance to get him a gift if need be.|`|hEcKmleVaa	Well, one date does not a Valentine make!  I would definitely wish him a Happy Valentine's Day and maybe have a special greeting card waiting just in case.  Nothing too overpowering, just a greeting.  If your second date goes very well, you might want to pick up a small gift for him such as a book or gift card.|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	Its best not to expect anything so that if you dont get anything you wont be let down.|`|cdqR8lGMaa	If he is really into you, then he will make it his business to get you a nice Valentines Day gift!|`|63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	Probably nothing significant - just a card or a single flower.  If he gives you a load of flowers or a lot of candy (or sexy underwear), I'd put some distance (but FAST) between you and he.  That kind of overblown enthusiasm is an indication he's overly needy or has unbalanced expectations of you.|`|AA11414589	Well it depends how the second date goes, and if you go on another one (3rd) before V-day.    The sure fire way to know if he's into you, is if he asks you out ON valentines day!    If he's interested, and planning on doing something/getting something for you on vday, he'll want to hang out on that day.     If he doesn't ask you out on valentines day, then don't expect anything, because that most likely means he's avoiding it on purpose!|`|H42WbQATaa	Yea, nothing big....a little heart shape box of chocolate or w/e       if he gets you nothing well then....wow, what a loser?|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Here is to make sure you do get one;    My grandma always told us this trick they used to do on men in the old days when she was a teenager.    First of all, the girl must go commando on the day that she plans her action.  She should wear a flair type skirt and a pretty blouse....  Once she has his attention, she must squat on one knee as if to tie a shoe lace, and allow him to "accidentally" see that she is going commando.  She must not let him look for long enough that he can actually see clearly, but keep him guessing if he had seen what he had actually seen.  She says that this uncertainty sparks a man's interest and keeps them pursuing the girl until she gives in.|`|GWSFecsOaa	Well, kind of. Its okay if the guy doesn't get you anything...as long as he says something on that day... Spends a little extra time with you. Shows that he appreciates you. Maybe signs of affection would be more meaningful. Good luck.|`|BuctVReEaa	Depending how the next date goes; but only a small token at this VERY EARLY stage.|`|URxUGoUMaa	i wouldnt expect one, but maybe you could go on a date on valentines n buy something while your out?    xx|`|fYzXwMNIaa	Yes, I'd expect to get one if it was me.|`|exZK0rgnaa	maybe.. if his really into you... or you can ask him if you like to exchange gifts :D

The girls also had to do the nude thing (but was topless). and then we later did it when we were drunk. haha, my friend rode his bike into a wall. another one was for truth, whether they like gay porn and for two girls to kiss. Another was for one to kiss and lick another persons foot.  Then, right at the end, the dare was to break the bottle we were spinning on their head. hahahahahahah, omw, they smashed it on me like twice. i still have a crazy bruise|`|F5R3TJEQaa	I dare you too kiss your crush on the cheek next time you see him and if you do it ill give you 50 bucks oh and chocolates.

60ApQsGOaa	This is what i LOVED about high school. (even if you arnet in high school). Okay, it doesn't matter if people love you or hate you. YOU. ARE. GOING. TO. BE. JUDGED. Me personally, I was a sponsored skateboarder, and a pretty damn good snowboarder. I was always chillin with the dudes in high school. Not some groupie, but i was able to keep up and stuff. Everyone thought I was screwin them all. So, if you are just wanting to be friends, people are going to do that regardless. Ifyou are going to go your seperate ways because of this issue and find another guy friend, people are gonna say "omg she went from one guy to another, to another!!" Its inevitable. The solution?? DGAF! Dont give a F--. Who cares who says what. You know the truth about whats going on and so does the people who matter to you. That friend of yours and your other close friend. Everyone else? Piss on them.|`|18lbiKlVaa	all you can do is when people ask you if you like him just say no,you don't have to explain yourself to anyone.and if you and him are really best friends nothing will get between you two.and now that you both have different girlfriends/boyfriends your seeing that you really still do have feeling for him,just let things fall into place,everything happens for a reason.|`|k828yC3Kaa	I had a problem similar to this. And not to be rude, but when theres a friendship between a guy and a girl, 99.9% of the time, one of them wants to be something more, but thats just from personal experience. As far as having people not judge you, try hanging together, but with large groups of people so it doesn't look suspicious. This "platonic" relationship is probably making you significant others jump to conclusions to at times. You should all talk it out with each other. Also, think about the situation. Are you happier when your with your friend? Or with your boyfriend? If your not completely over him people have reason to judge, sorry. You probably make people think it without even knowing. All in all, see if you want to continue you relationship with your boyfriend, or go with your friend. Good luck.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Two issues:  1. Why do you care if people judge you for who you are hanging out with? I am having trouble understanding why people jumping to conclusions would PREVENT you from hanging out. Be with whomever you'd like.  2. You said yourself you are not completely over this guy. Well, I am 40 and I am not COMPLETELY over my first girlfriend 22 years ago. That is a part of love. However, in your case you are still hanging out with this guy you are not over! At the very least it is unfair to your current BF to be spending emotional energy and time with a guy you are "not completely over". If you were married, this would be known as an emotional affair. Cool it with one or the other of these boys and be honest with yourself.
IPS3hWweaa	Drop his cheating butt. He's probably banging away on some other girl he has on the side. Make him accountable! If not, show him the door.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Unless you are preparing him dinner, why do you have to know?  Sounds clingy to me.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Understand that he is working and sometimes he can not stop and call a needy girlfriend and explain why he is working late.  Ok- let's stop in the middle of this engine overhaul so I can call my girlfriend.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Either he has to understand your needs better or you have to understand his job better. I don't know either of you, but something has to give.   If you are waiting at the restaurant and he doesn't show for two hours then that's a problem. If you just want someone to talk to after your day and he's in the middle of brain surgery then that's an entirely different problem.  Figure out why he doesn't call or why you need him to.
UTxA4F8maa	Maybe you could offer her some help or tutoring with some of her subjects.

No, it would lead to complicated emotions.|`|cTYAYrb9aa	Do you mean like a girl and boy who are "friends" but hug lots and kiss? O_O ???    There are girls like that at my school.

8IyZphFVaa	maybe she's depressed or really hates her job. why don't you just ask her to make an effort to figure out what the problem is (on her own). if she doesn't see any reason why she should change her habits or she just doesn't want to do it, it's not going to happen. so make sure it's something she wants for herself first and then the best you can do is tell her your concerns, LISTEN, offer advice, and be helpful when she asks for it. but don't make assumptions. try to be more observant or ask her how she's feeling and what she's thinking, what she's been doing, when you see her calling off.|`|Wch2WybQaa	It sounds like she hates her job.  Perhaps she should get a new job, or find some way to enjoy her current one.  If that does not work, help her out by staying home when the kids are home, so she can work.|`|WMkJ1GQyaa	I think that she either really hates her job or she is going through some form of depression. Think she needs help. Better try to get her some counseling to determine what's wrong with her. You are the only one who can help her.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Yes, well, she might hate her job and rather stay home with the kids and all, but we all would rather do those things. We get up and go to work b/c we must get the paycheck and we earn vacation time to get away from work and spend time doing what we really love (in my case: beach.) In your wife's case, she's either lazy or possibly depressed.  But here's the deal for you: Has she lost jobs? Is she risking her employment b/c of her lazy attitude towards work? Does she miss out on promotions or bonuses? If not then you will have to live with this behavior, b/c it would be folly, and harmful to your marriage, if you tried to be her life coach. If she is missing out on these things then you can point out to her in a friendly way that things could be better for her if she got there on time, etc.  You might want to take the kids on a great vacation or two without her since you have properly cared for your vacation time and have earned it.  If you really believe that she is depressed, then she'll need medical and psychological help.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	Just ask her ... Motivation will come muh easier once you diagnose the problem.|`|AA10529198	Sounds like you are the loser.  Why should your wife work in the first place ?? You can't afford for her to stay home ?? Well, then, (loser) why did you have kids ?    Hope she leaves you.|`|au3cHeK4aa	i think your wife is deeply unhappy in her job and would love to devote all her time and energy on you and the kids.  is there a way she could retrain and get a job she enjoys or work from home even. money is important to us all and your right we all have to bite the bullet and go in regardless of how we feel sometimes, but two years is a long time to be stuck doing something you hate.  if she knew you understood how she felt and were willing to find a way to change things with her then her motivation should improve and by telling her how valued she is you both should be able to get on better too..|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	Has she had a physical lately?  Is her health doing O.K.?  That would be the first thing you should check to see if she is having any health issues.  Next, do you participate in helping with the household chores and the children?  Keeping the home going and staying on top of the children are two of the biggest areas that need constant attention.  Then, tell her how you feel and that you are planning to take a nice vacation this year and you truly want the entire family to enjoy themselves but she needs to plan how to have enough leave for it.  Discuss where you want to go, and what you want to do, and see what she says about this.  Ask her if there is something you can do to  help her be on time in the morning.  If she is chronically late, it will be exposed if she applies for a new job.  If she is depressed or hates her job, see what you can do to help her.  You are her husband.  She depends on you to help.
AA11101968	Why are you letting your friends leave marijuana in your freezer?  You are a giant hypocrite, and of course he won't take you seriously.|`|izbAdDUraa	get over it.  when he starts shooting heroin THEN you have something to complain about.   sheesh.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Just go burn one with him,  you just might like it.

He has to choose weed or you. Not both. People are full of mistakes so you can forgive him...|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Hello,    I am sorry to hear about your fiance problem. you need to tell him how it makes you feel. If he does not change it means he does not care about you, it means that smoking is more important than you. I would then think it over and in my opinion it would be better to stop this relationship before it is too late.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	my only thought is if your so against it why was it in your home prior to him getting there!  no wonder why he didn't tak you serous your actions don't back it up!     i don't see him doing anything to remove your trust!  it's not like he hid it from you he was open about doing something!   if you don't think you can trust him over something like this then maybe you should seek some real help Trust is a big thing with any marriage, and again he didn't hide it from you! he told you whats not to trust!  he is being open and honest with you there for makes me think your the one who has more of an issue!   if you want to be with him you may have to take that risk of him not taking you seriouse on a lot of thingS!   frankly your being a tade prude over this ... express how you feel leave it at that! if he continues to do that crap then leave him!  or take the bad with the good!   i know couples who do that stuff one does one don't and he is the one who is not for it!  that's cool all he asks is for her not to do it in the home and not to let him know!   They worked something out!   are you willing to work something out with the man you love?|`|5CVmHYNhaa	Lighten up|`|D6Z2rYqsaa	forgive,but never forget.  you arent overreacting, he should respect that you only want the best for him and especially about something serious like marijuana.  id give him one more chance, and if you arent sure postpone the wedding or get an anullment if its too late for that.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	He won't stop unless he wants too.     Now you having the weed for your friend.....I don't understand. If you are very against it, why keep something for a friend. Especially if you know your fiance smokes weed.     If I was you, don't get married until he stops. (unless you don't care he'll be smoking when you two are married.    When I met my husband, I was a teen who smoke cigs, like maybe once a week.. My husband doesn't like to date people who smoke. My first boyfriend smoke weed alot and I did sometimes. I never told my husband that I did, as we were first dating and I didn't want to lose him. Within a year I stop smoking cigs, because I love my husband too much to lose him. Eventually I did tell him I smoke weed when I was with my first boyfriend, but cuz I have never done it while I was with my husband..he was ok with it.    If your husband cares and loves you, he'll stop.|`|TKNPveHDaa	If he does it again, leave.  End of story.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Why was there marijuana in your freezer if you're so against it?  If he has only smoked four times since you've been together, then he is not a 'pot head' or an addict.  If he loves you enough, it should be no big deal for him not to smoke anymore.    Don't marry him yet if you're worried he will disrespect your wishes again.  Give him either enough time to slip up and call it quits, or enough time until you feel comfortable that it won't happen again.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	The next thing you know he'll be shooting up smack, then it will be coke and then crystal meth. All of his teeth will fall out and his face will have open sores on it and he'll drop a bunch of weight. He will lose his job and become homeless. He will turn to crime to support his habit. He might even become a male prostitute.  Remember weed is a 'gateway' drug, it's beginning of the end. Get out before he sucks you into his drug crazed frenzy.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Yeah, it would be stupiddddddddddd to forgive him!|`|f6YsGOynaa	He found it in YOUR freezer, therefore YOU are being a hypocrite.|`|uYukJagsaa	y don't u want it in your life so nad is the question.|`|oztoPKrGaa	wait. you dont want it in your life...  but you stash your friends in your freezer?  thats stupid.   were u trying to set himup.  I dont get why you would ***** at him over it.  Weed isnt all like they make it out to be.  If i was marrying someone like you id have to smoke to keep my self calm because it sounds like you are a ****** which adventually will chase anyman away.  Just get over it.  Tell him not to do it infront of you  and there its settled.  Im sure u have done things he isnt so fond of.  And im really really sure you have lied and hid something:/  If he wants to do something   he is a grown man  not a little boy anymore  treat him like one.|`|y07MGbLcaa	try it and see where he is coming from, its awesome =]|`|AA10617489	I'm glad you expressed how important it is to you.  It may be possible that he believed you the first time, but when he found it in your freezer thought it was less important.  Figuring if it is in your freezer you must not have a big problem with it.      I would definitely give him another chance.  You are obviously committed to each other and if you are in the relationship for good you can work it out.  Make sure if you are not going to have marijuana in your life it is also not in your house for the sake of the relationship.|`|NlnM6diMaa	If he's smart he'll choose the weed over you.|`|tCI8ksvdaa	It would appear you aren't really being honest with us or perhaps even with yourself.  Your friends have marijuana at your home and you allow them to keep it in your freezer.  Your fiance is a user of marijuana and you know it yet you are still with him.  It seems you are only against the drug when it suits your purpose and of course there are always exceptions for your desires, right?  Either take a stand against marijuana and get new friends and dump the fiance or stay with these people and quit the phony moral judgments.|`|1J2OwIUgaa	Well LIke everyone else has been saying if you dont want the drug in your life why are you keeping it in your freezer for a friend? You want to get caught with it and get it trouble for your friend. I see. I understand that you want him to take you seriously but he needs to take you seriously. He finds it in the freezer, why wouldnt he smoke it. Think about your actions before you get upset with his.
E2eUIVvOaa	stand up to her and dont take her crap! she doesn't have any right to treat you like that and you have every right to feel happy and safe in school. you don't have to make everyone hate her, just stand up to her. i don't mean shouting down on her, but you can tell her (sorry, but u shud do it nicely) to back off. if she doesn't, stand ur ground until she does. if she goes too far you can always tell an adult|`|clu2Ia4paa	u cant MAKE people hate her. if she is mean, they have to see her how she really is. when she is doing something bad to u do something to get ur friend's attention to see that she's mean and then they might hate her  but not cuz u told them to cuz they see that she's mean and bad. but they also might not hate her cuz everybody is different and they might like her personality.  try to get ur friends attention when she is being mean, and when she being mean to u say something to make her thing that what she does, doesn't bother u and take everything she says as a joke(try  to say something back that makes what she was said funny,she will hate that)  well, i hope i helped :)|`|izbAdDUraa	revenge is never the answer. kill her with kindness, meaning, just be nice to her. don't let her bother you.   carrying around all those negative feelings is not good.|`|ig0miCndaa	why in the world would you want everyone to hate somebody?  that is not a very nice thing to think or say or do.

How would you feel if everyone hated you?|`|cTYAYrb9aa	I hate girls like that, they get everyone round their little finger when only you can see how a hurtful person they are. I find the only way to deal with girls like is to just be polite - but not get too involved with them. If your friends and her a talking, just listen along and nod, don't talk. Maybe you could also try and get your friends to spend more time with you alone. :)    Good luck.    x|`|G7sANdhFaa	tell them she done something that will embassies her|`|MSnfmeP0aa	do something that can make her look mean infront of others.it cud be d exact reason why u hate her.make her shout at u infront of ur friends.if they r ur true friends they will surely hate her.|`|sjJSjtynaa	Trick her. Try to get together with her and the rest of your friends somewhere that includes lunch. You tell her scince you love her so much that youll by her her food. Make it extra fatening. do this as many times as possible. then she'd get fat and miserable. Lie to her and tell her that your parents let you take your credit card to the mall and have a shopping spree. Then when she says my parents would never do that convince her to just take it. Then u guys can go out and you put all your things on hold while she spends. Tell her you forgot it and will just get the clothes the next day. Her parents will get mad and you can tell everyone at school what happened. Convince someone anonomisly that if you pay them 20 bucks they'll pull her pants off in front of the whole school. Convince her she'll look gorgoes in a hideous hair cut. Tell her that the hot guy inschool likes her then when she tries to go for it she'll get all embarresed when he turns her down. Get her to flunk in class so she fails u move on and she'll be in a lower grade harder for her to annoy you. ok im all out|`|ezxrCnZ6aa	well u don't just have ur friends hang  out with u and try 2 convince one by one that shes mean and rude not a good friend go for the easy people first then have them help u with the more harder people.

My question to you is how old are these guys that you are dating?  Instead of focusing on marriage and dating, try focusing on school and being a kid.  You are only a kid once and you have the rest of your life to deal with adult issues.  Go hang out with your friends and do what 13 yr old kids usually do.

Why mess it up?  Just be glad he's come around.  Leave it alone.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I think the most important part of a marriage is trust and honesty, You have to be honest with him about everything and be open about how you feel.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	No let it go.. You already got a great laugh. Just enjoy his humility|`|rXORvIstaa	Nahh, don't say anything.  It seems he is learning his lesson.  He was caught up in a fantasy about her, not real love.  Love is much deeper than an idealized fantasy.  Love is what you are doing for him.  You are understanding of his past and that situation and are mature enough to wait it out, to let him find out for himself that she is a tramp who probably never loved him.  Now that he is putting his ex behind him, I'm sure your marriage will get better.  Just keep working on things, doing what I'm sure you know is healthy nurturing of a relationship (and teach him to do the same by talking with him) and I'm sure you will both be happy and have an incredible marriage.  Take care.|`|4gEU73sAaa	I think that he learned his lesson.  I think that if  you say anything it will only add fuel to the fire.  He knows how she is and he can't expect her to change.  You should just leave it alone and not say anything about it, while be the supportive wife that you are.    Be there for him and listen to him if he needs to talk about it.  He really needs your support in this and you need to let him know that you are there for him.|`|8449a75b059164ff6d7636d90b469f9daa	Since he is telling you how grateful he is and letting you know he has let her know he has no intention of dealing with her other than about this child (you know he told her that, that has to be why she played up to him.She knows how he USED to feel about her,she probably thought she could sway him in her direction.) It is tax time and he may need to claim the child he has with her and she probably wants some or all of the money. He didn't know the bomb was coming but she set him up with the" come hither" he didn't fall for it now she wants money. Stand by your man and don't say anything. Just keep it under your hat,. right now he is surprised by this, later he might get angry, either way if you want him he is still yours. If not, just keep this under your hat anyway. I know it hurt you to think that it looked like he was falling for her line and leaving you to attend to her needs but you will still have the last laugh. Just don't worry about it,  You won't have to make the payments he will and he can do it after he claims the child.

Your agent will get your songs to the right people for review by other artist.    The consultant part will only come after you have proved yourself in the industry.  Once you have then others will value your opinions and pay your for your advice.    Another tip, look for a female agent.|`|RlcfZAxQaa	Simple answer - you must have TALENT....    Otherwise forget all about it!|`|4gEU73sAaa	This is very common since for so long we have lived in a "man's world".  It seems to me that for so long the women were the ones who had to stay at home and take care of the common household duties.  These days, we are no longer in this "man's world", although most men don't see women as equals.  I know you are frustrated, but don't let it get you down.  You need to stick to your guns and be as professional as you can be.  Someday, someone will take you seriously and you will get what you want instead of giving some chauvinist man what he wants.     Good Luck!|`|EENUWAP7aa	I like your question and find it very interesting.    Do you know that Paul Williams worked with Barbra Streisand during her early days in filming where hit songs were something to shoot for.    Williams has worked with the Carpenters and many other artists as well. His talents in song writing and composure is just overwhelming.    I personally have met Shaun Cassidy, Barbra Streisand, Carrol O'connor, De Barge, Michael Wycoff and practiced in a band with Tommy Lee called, Suite 19. Tommy later left the band and started over with more serious musicians and formed Motely Crue.  Tommy Lee was the last person I spoke with before leaving the studio. I told him I was going to join the Airforce and music was not my cup of Tea.     Tommy was upset about the Producer wanting to make so many changes in the band for personal reasons rather than what the band could actually do. I loved the band, but Motely Crue defninitely was his succesful role and I have not seen Tommy since that time. I was going to try and sing lead, but that flopped, my voice was not high enough.    What I am saying to you is that need to meet just one good artist and consult at least on good artist and the rest is history as you will become an Entrepreneur in the Music Business World.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	the field your tring to get into Well how can i put this nicely !   1st. its' not what you know but who you know!!!   2nd. most peeps in this businses expect you to sleep with them to get somewhere DON'T do that!

OOeoFvB6aa	If you've been in her life since she was born then I hope that you will stay in her life.  She thinks of you as her father even if you don't have the same DNA.  Family is about more than blood.  I hope you are her biological father, but if not, you may be able to legally adopt her.

HYnBeyJsaa	Ah finally, a question im actually going to enjoy answering..here is the 5 steps to knowing when you are truly in love with somebody:    1) You constantly think of him everyday and every night.  2) You want him to go with you everywhere that you go.  3) You change things in your life that he does not like about you just to make him happy.  4) If you used to be one of those people that had more than one boyfriend at the same time but suddenly find yourself wanting to be commited to him and nobody else.  5) You're mad at him because of something but then you call him just to hear his voice or you text him just to see if he would write back|`|KeOCO8kTaa	When you like the person not for his/her body or popularity but rather for his/her virtues and characteristics.    Proverbs 31:10  Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.|`|Pdex43zgaa	When they stalk you constantly. By the way, why does your hair look like mickey mouse?
a1Ngi39Xaa	Depends on the guy - some of them want only one thing, of course.  Other ones want a relationship but they get freaked out when they get close to someone.  It's hard to find a guy who is grown up enough to know what he wants and strong enough to go after it and stay with it.      They're not all bad - I promise.  It just seems that way sometimes.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Because they move on to someone else who they can do it with.|`|RAfiFIc0aa	Because most of the time they are looking for an easy lay. When you don't give in as easily, they get disinterested. Granted, not all guys are this way, but a lot of them are.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Because they got what they wanted|`|GWmkKF5jaa	in america the name of the game seems to be sex, humiliation and domination. i feel men in this country are very immature and false.|`|yXHUINHSaa	because we want a girl that is simple and who can understand our feelings and don't make fun us.okzzzzz!!!!|`|QmCH8Ugaaa	I want a girl thats:  -loyal  -honest  -thoughtful  -understanding  -can be independent|`|abTZX46faa	money|`|Y5QrpV62aa	Sometimes it be the stuff you do that they might not like...

Most of the guys are jerk and all they want is to have sex.  as long as the girl keep playing games, guy stays after the girl.  right next moment she has sex with the guy. Its all over.  but it doesnt mean all the guys are like that. there are really very decent guys in a very huge quantity. and its not only with guys.. there are some girls who also do the same.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	LOL well I think its kind of silly--I would not generalize but I will say this; guys like a chase.  If there is no chase they lose interest even when they are attracted and possibly like the girl! Its so lame right??     Plus it boosts guys ego to know that a girl likes them so if the girl does all the work like initiating him and doing a ton of nice things for him it can actually turn him off.  He wants the role of dominance.  You must allow a true man to be just that.  Some guys are just indecisive and are not sure what they want others are highly selective when it comes to who they want a relationship with as opposed to just sex. Most guys see women as just physical until they SHOW them not tell them, Show themselves as more by their actions.    Women are emotional beings we react based off our feelings often! Men are physical creatures who tend to act off actions not emotions.  So there is an issue right there.  Women tend to assume things that may not be true (men do it too) they assume somone "likes" them based off a feeling they felt when in actuality the guy may not be as interested as you presume.  Some guys are just flirts or just being nice to you because it boosts their ego to know if they wanted to be physical with you, they could.  Hope this somewhat helps.|`|6fZzRFIXaa	simple! sex. if you don't certify they run|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	because most guys don't have emotions and just want some ***.|`|DHt8w4oFaa	coot noot|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	I can tell you that we do not want any games, be upfront with us, we have a hard enough time trying to figure out what girls want let alone what we want........|`|RlcfZAxQaa	Once guys realize the girl is a bimbo - they lose interest very quickly & move on to better pastures.|`|tH6Xmyf1aa	Have you looked in the mirror lately????

It is fraud, and it should not go unpunished.  Assuming he does not go to prison long-term, she also needs to formally file for child support payments.

Tell her to be careful next time w/ unprotected sex.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Same Exact Situation!    2004 I moved back home from college. Met my Ex and 4 months later I was pregnant and he said he would take care of me. After he moved me to a apartment I had our daughter, he moved taking everything. Even the scissors in the kitchen.     Some Men impregnate awesome woman as their ace in the hole for bad times. A mother like caring figure. They promise the world and take off when Life really hits. The mistake I made was remaining involved with this Man for too long. These Men are the epitomy of Narcassism and Narcassistic behavior. I take it that Amanda was a Good Student with a bright future ahead of her.    The biggest mistake that I advise Amanda not to fall in is allowing this Guy to jump in and out of her Life. I wasted 41/2 years of my life allowing this. Her child is young and can easily adapt to a Real Man that can step and take care of Mom. Needless to say my Ex has continued to wreck his life and is in divorce court. What a mess he has to deal with. I thank the Lord in my Life from Saving Me from his Carmatic MESS!|`|wUodHpEuaa	Tell your friend she can contact the credit card companies. They have his signature on file, if you are telling the truth that he applied for the cards. It's called identity theft and her ex boyfriend can be put in jail. Call the police and press charges. She can file for child support and let the court assign the visitation. If her ex boyfriend works, have his pay wage deducted for the child support payments that way she is sure the support will be paid. As for the depression story, that was an excuse, a cop out, a bail out, a way of ditching his responsibilities. She is better off with out him.|`|nv4QV1OVaa	Tell her to cut her losses and pay attention to who impregnates her in the future. All she can do is enjoy the baby now. If she continues to stay tangled in the web with this guy things will only get worse.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	What an awful situation. Hurt feelings and emotions aside, I would suggest to Amanda that she do whatever is legally possible to charge him with opening up the cards in her name and getting child support for her son. It's admirable that he wants to be a part of his son's life, but picking up and leaving him and Amanda doesn't exactly show devotion to the son. She's going to be the main provider for the son, and being a dad doesn't mean just showing up on weekends for visits.    In regard to the other mess of him walking out on his and Amanda's relationship, while it sucks for Amanda, she can't make someone love her. He clearly has issues of his own to deal with, and she needs to focus on what's best for her son.    I'll send good thoughts her way! :)|`|4gEU73sAaa	First of all, she needs to find a good lawyer to set out guidelines for visitation and child support.  Then, she need to, subsequently, get that lawyer to file criminal charges against him for identity theft.  This will help her get over him, as she will get her revenge if he goes to jail and has to pay back all of the debts that he incurred in her name.      Tell her that she needs to get this done soon.  If she doesn't want him to be in her son's life, she needs to get a protective order against him because he has admitted to being depressed and needs help before she will consider letting her child be alone with him.  He may try to do something foolish while their child is in her care.    Good luck to her and I hope she gets this straightened out.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	That's why they invented BIRTH CONTROL.  This is the life your friend chose - now she has to live it - good, bad and ugly...The best you can do is be there for her.    A baby a marriage does not make...
aHtIUZIQaa	I agree with nathanandkandce i think you should just ignore her because it won't help you in the end by being as immature as they are. You have to be the bigger person so just don't worry as long as you and your fiance are ok then who cares about them.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Revenge is only going to cause a larger riff, between your future in-laws and may even have drastic results on your fiance.  This is something that you need to leave alone.  If it that big of an issue, then end your engagement and find someone else that accepts you, and his family accepts you also.  Life is to short to be dealing with this mess.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	What? Why would you do that? I hope you are joking.     Cover her with honey while she's sleeping and then put feathers on the bedroom fan. Tie a string to her arm and to the pull switch on the fan. When she wakes up, the feathers will fall and stick to her!  Or you could cut her hair when she isn't looking. Put worms in her spaghetti dinner.     But in reality I think you should grow up a bit.|`|nv4QV1OVaa	Yeah, get some revenge. That should make them like you even more!|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Ok well first off you dont need to get revenge on anyone.That isnt going to do a thing and it isnt very mature to think that way at all.You need to communicate with her and tell her how you are feeling.This is your finace and obviously this woman is going to be a part of your life.Have your man set up a get together for you and just lay it all out there and tell her exactly how you feel.Maybe you two just didnt hit it off in the beginning and you need time to start fresh and get to know eachother.If you do that and it still doesnt work then just keep your distance and dont go looking for trouble.I am sure eventually it will all work out.Just give it time and be patient.Best of luck|`|kogsyGAPaa	revenge, that's a definite no! Just try to be charming next time your around. I'd focus on the mother and ask about her job, what her favorite meals are, etc. People like to be asked things about themselves! Or if she's making a food or something ask her how she makes it, it might become a long conversation. Basically, you just want to get them to enjoy your company and overcome any prior feelings they might have had. According to God, Do not overcome by evil,but overcome evil with good." Now obviously, evil is not your predicament, however something is wrong here and what you need is kindness and friendliness. How bout bring some homemade brownies or cookies for his mother next time? Or perhaps some special bread you made or such? Or even, tell your boyfriend that you want to bring food over and make dinner for his family! As a little bonding time!  I think this might end up being fun in the end!    Best wishes!|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Revenge doesn't get your anywhere..creates more issues..|`|e5FoLh2Paa	Grow up is what you should do.  If she doesn't want to see you or be around you, so what?      Get revenge with her and let us know how that worked out for ya.|`|4gEU73sAaa	If you feel as if you are not welcome, let your fiance know how you feel and let him know that you will no longer be going with him to his mother's home because of it.  If you don't do this, he will never understand why you stopped trying to go and see his mother.    The last thing you need to do is get revenge.  You need to be the adult about it all and not play their childish games.

bVROvLNSaa	I am sorry for your loss.    To answer your question - that would likely depend on the kind of relationship you had.  I would say that one year is fairly typical, because that would give you an opportunity to grieve through your memories of each holiday.  If you have gone through some bereavement counselling, you are likely ready to start another relationship.    I wish you all the best.|`|AA10873763	Speak for yourself.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I got married June 24 and I used glads.  Sam's Club florist ordered a whole bunch for me.  I put 5 stems in each vase and one great thing about glads is they have multiple blooms so it look like far more flowers.  With orange, pink, red and white it will be really easy for the florist to get flowers in that color.  If you want more ooph in the vase, get some baby's breath to fill it out.  You could also buy some tall grasses to add in the light green instead of baby's breath.    As to cheaper alternatives, it really depends on the flower.  Cheaper than orchids or tulips flown in from Holland, oh yeah.  Cheaper than baby's breath and carnations, probably not.    I scattered marbles and votives around the table to fill up the space.    You could also use colored marbles with pillar candles in each vase.  You could use fish.  I have a friend who has an aquarium.  She took fish (goldfish I think or maybe small koi) and put them in individual bowls on the table.  At the end of the night, she dumped them back in her aquarium at home.      With orange and pink, you could also get really interesting shaped vases.  Then dye sand and make sand art like they do at fairs.  It would depend on the size of the table and vase as to if that would fill the table or be expensive.    Another inexpensive idea is to use large flowers instead.  I've known people to float one large sunflower or hydrangea in the center of the table in a bowl of water.  A magnolia would work as well.  You don't have any height to your tables that way which could be a negative.  Sunflowers are so easy to grow however so you could really plant a bunch and use them for the height as well.  Even my family doesn't kill off sunflowers which is really a feat.    Most people say you can't mix fake flowers and real flowers but you can if you do it right.  They can't be right next to each other like in the same vase, but it's perfectly ok to use both.  I bought garlands of hibiscus and cut each bloom off.  I then scattered the blooms around the room (favors table, buffet table, and tied them to the fake trees they had in the room).  It made the trees fit in with my decor and they popped.    For winter weddings I've seen brides use twigs as the centerpieces.  They looked great.  Fill the bottom up with cranberries or holly berries if you have one of those on your property.  Tall twigs sticking out the top.  It looked very "decorator" on a very small budget.  For a June wedding, you could add in sticks with flowers but in June since so much is blooming in season, flowers are really inexpensive.|`|cwFOKMBBaa	Use some green oasis and decorate it with some similar flowers to your colour scheme.    Or you could buy some inexpensive balloons and hire some helium gas and make nice balloon arrangements and then sprinkle the table with party confetti and glitter.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	We used square mirrors as the base, a small vase with a colored daisy candle floating in it. On the table and mirror, we spread colored silk flower petals with some glitter.|`|wADnvKGFaa	CARNATIONS!  The cheapest flowers and they come in every colour. You could even assemble them yourself.    A neat idea I saw once.  Get little bowls, fill them with colours glass beads and put a Beta fish in each. At the end of the night, one guest at each table gets to take him home.  These fish come on soooo many colours and this will be a great conversation piece too.|`|nxPioaw5aa	http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...    you could use sliced oranges and limes in glass vases summered in water.  this link as a few ideas, but instead of flowers, you could do floating candles.    Or something similar to this with some votive candles beneath:    http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...    good luck!|`|VTee51r9aa	a lot of people use candles as centerpieces - you could also use photo cubes with pictures of you and your fiance. You could use fake flowers for the centerpieces, my cousin did this for her wedding and they were beautiful.|`|f9ca0489c84566012f6ae440195cf6b4aa	at a wedding show recently, one caterer had a table decorated with a cluster of ivory colored candles, in various sizes, making a loose circle in the middle - with a ring of off-white rose petals around it.  some of the candles were set up on 4-6 inch glass candle holders and others were in the votive glasses.  It was lovely - and you can often find candles for half off at the hobby stores.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I put a sight on here to look at. I would do like a cute plant, such as a bamboo or others. You can use the glass marbles to maintain the color of your reception or possibly find one that blooms a little in that color. it is cute and unique|`|3WQOa4sraa	well the cheapest one is a glass like fish bowl with silk petals and floating candles -  its simple and nice to look at over dinner    you may also consider some bird cage decoration, a white bird cage in the centre of the tables,  I have 3 tables and as I have 3 bridesmaids they are going to put their bouquets inside the cages for the dinner  - you could use silk flowers, pearl strings or even just a plant of some sort      http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TPi0n7DhN8s/R-...    They do ones at confetti.co.uk for 14.99    and also search on ebay to buy in bulk for cheap
29hcn9JRaa	I don't necessarily think that he doesn't love you anymore, however it is apparent that he may be bored, stressed, overwhelmed, and above all he may not be connected with you? and being that we are only hearing your side of the story, as their are always two sides, what do you think his version would be? He may be having the same opinion regarding your kisses, he may think sex with you is also pathetic? Marriages don't typically break down on account of one person, usually it takes two to bring a marriage down to this point, so please understand, this marriage is the creation of both you and your husband, you both made it this way, and if you have any desire to hold onto it and keep your family intact, it will take work from the two of you to take it from dysfunctional to functioning. Stepping out of a marriage isn't like breaking up with a boyfriend, it is very taxing on both spouses, so think about all your options prior to making a decision that you may later regret, and if their is any chance that you two can salvage this mess, then do give it at least a shot, their are children involved and they deserve better.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	definitely NOT normal!|`|b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	Im sorry Beth... that sounds horrible. And im afraid what to say to you, because im not 100% sure whats wrong with him.    Is he on drugs? usually certain drugs will make you seem like a zombie (anti depressants) try to find out... or try to go to counciling... i hope you see you do better, and cant wait to see you back on the Nascar section...|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	It's Over.......|`|exZK0rgnaa	Why dont you go up to him and tell him what your feeling and whats going on?|`|r8ozJABSaa	honestly there are 3 options    1. Talk to him and tell him how u feel    2. Maybe he might b stressed out about something    3. He could not want to be with you anymore, or maybe he cheating on u and its overr    gud luck!|`|fOOKtEhFaa	try talking to him about it, if you haven't already. maybe he doesn't realize how hurt you are. && if things dont start to change, then maybe there is someone else better for you. but you need to communicate with your bf and find out wat the issue is before you decide to move on with your life.|`|mBEGTccdaa	Have you thought of the possibility that he is seeing someone else? Either that or get couples counceling. Personally I would get out of the relationship and find someone who will show compassion for you.|`|AA10225271	mmh=( well you know that at some point this man was in love with you so whether or not he still is now he should still care about how your feeling or whats wrong with you.To be honest that could be whats going on but there are other things too.It sounds like he possibly could have a drug problem that he's keeping from you.Thats how he acts anyways.It is practically impossible for anyone here to tell you whats going on but you really are just going to have to sit him down while hes in a the most sensitive/sweet mood he can be in and really look into his eyes calmly, ask what you need to ask and tell him why you feel that way.If he's still a jerk after that and wasnt just going through a bad/moody phase then just get rid of him.if he doesnt care about how you feel then don't waste your time.It WONT slap you in the face,your better off without being treated that way.
NqbBjS0raa	If the movie is geared for their age group it would be good for them to experience this event even if costly. Explain ahead of time the importance of keeping the glasses on will make the movie come closer and help them enjoy the the view better. Tell them if they can endure the glasses you will take them to more of the same. Promise a good eating trip too if you can afford it. (food they like ex. pizza) Make it fun and not prohibitive so they will get the drift.....(how long is it? hopefully not too long so their attention spans like yours won't drift lol)
CtWTlQKlaa	It's hard to tell if you're serious. If you sent her a letter in English then chances are she couldn't understand what you were saying. I'm guessing either you are not American or this is some lame joke to see how people react. I don't know what you should do.|`|ixHwF4apaa	try to meet her, explain every thing and Console her|`|LbrFLgWPaa	Okay, so first you need to decide if you "really" want her back in the first place. Why go through all the effort when you both doubt that anything is there. My ex tried to do this w/us for about  a month. He didn't get that we had no chemistry. You guys aren't me and maybe you do have something there...only you know that.    The way to try and get me back is chivalry, and romace. If you haven't expalined your sweet gesture to not disturb her...tell her. Don't do what my ex did and smother her w/attention. Theres a happy medium in there :)...Good Luck in your decision!|`|5r48jn7iaa	you should try to talk to some of her friends in her city and get them to "have a girls night out with her" and you should show up and surprise her. its a good way to make up not seeing her last time in a cute way. maybe even show up with some flowers.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Lol, wow um why couldnt you just e-mail her or call?? Um explain how much she means to you to her and that you didnt just leave you tried to be there and didnt want to disturb her during her exams etc.  You were being a good bf.  Maybe she got the letter kind of late?? Just let her know you love her and cannot see yor life without her in it.  You ahould get her some flowers.  this should change her anger right away if you are sincere and honest.  If not, she is a ***** move on.|`|H42WbQATaa	uhh.... she might just be acting like something is your fault. chicks love feeling good about themselves so they lay the blame on you. truth is that long distance thing...well , lets just say "good luck with that"|`|uuMCGT9taa	try flowers and let her make the next move !|`|r8ozJABSaa	just tell her what ever u did wrong dat ur sorry and buy her something pretty, if dat doesnt work out then.....    tough luck pal!

MLdykhQNaa	I dealt with a similar situation with my brother.  Multiple bail outs which ran up to around $800 total.  He kept saying he'd pay X amount but I got way less, then tried to pass off the last $200.  There was not much I could do about it but take it as I got it.    I'd talk to her about it and explain you helped her out when she was in desparate need.  Put your foot down and explain if you don't get it all, don't expect another bailout from you.  Personally I won't ever borrow to my bro again.|`|znT5ApQeaa	me i would of talk to her she Your sister forgive her but she need to know she got no kids get to paying my money be payset|`|8IyZphFVaa	Never lend you family (or friends) money that you can't afford to give. She is your sister and if you want to continue having any kind of relationship with her or even see her face, take the $500 and hope that you get the rest back. You're lucky you get even that much back.  Next time, offer to let her stay with you for a couple of days or give her a smaller amount if you know you will need the money later. Don't explain anything to her if she asks why. Just tell her you don't have it or "lend" her what you know you can afford. For now, be gracious and take whatever she is willing to give you. It might not be right, but I only lend money to people I'm willing to sue. For everyone else, I tell them to pay me back when they can and hope to God I get lucky.|`|FzFSzilmaa	i'd take the 500, then next time she has problems, remind her how she was unwilling to pay you back and can forget any further charity...|`|QgFZfl89aa	tell her she needs to give it back that it was nice of you in the first place, and she shouldnt break your trust!|`|jhNUuz0maa	have her pay you back $840, since she said you owe her $160. Then call it a day. If she doesn't want to pay you any more than $500, then when she is in need of more money, remind her that she didn't pay you back in full yet and the bank is closed.    Also, regardless if you needed the money or not, she still owes you, and should pay you back. She is getting $4000 back, she could pay you back in full, unless she owes more money than that to other people.
sJy8zGNhaa	In the State of Missouri you are an adult at 17. You are not longer subject to juvenile laws such as curfew, truancy, or Incorrigibility. Your still in the custody of your parents though. And there is no emancipation in the state of Missouri anymore. It does not matter if the parents or child request it.       At 17 in Missouri the police are less likely to pursue you as a runaway but you are still legally a minor and therefore under parental control.    copied from site listed as source, there is much more information there|`|znT5ApQeaa	he rules i hate that when i stated coming coming home at 10 o clock is like i wish kid to rule|`|AA12159712	You are considered a minor until 18, and unless you are declared a liberated minor, you must follow your family where they say to go.|`|HGw3qqC4aa	No..
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	everyone could not be wrong about this guy could they? your just not willing to even trust that maybe he isn't the right person for u. your only 15, so don't rush romance, and do pay attention to others, who may only have your best interest at heart.|`|cdjLVZHraa	I think you are going to have to decide if this guy if worth it?  Or are you continuing to see him because your family disapproves?    Does your family have rational reasons for why they don't like your boyfriend and/or his family?  Have you talked with them to find out what exactly the problem is?  Have you told them how you feel and tried to work out something with them?    Try to look at the situation and your boyfriend without all the drama and emotion.  Take out a sheet of paper and list all his good qualities and all the benefits of the relationship on the one side - and then list all the bad things (including the family hassle) on the other.   Then make a rational decision.    At 15, this is probably not the guy you're going to spend the rest of your life with.  So why not find someone that your family will approve of?    On the other hand, it is not good that your family is calling you names and being mean to you because of who you are seeing.  They should be more mature than you, and they should be the ones sitting down with you and having a rational conversation about who you are seeing.  Name calling is really bad form.|`|tmUIYXlIaa	Open your ears up to those that have invested more time in you.  Without more detail, everyone has to assume that something happened between your families that disturbed the relationship.  Sounds like your not helping that, and that you may be that thing.  I'd say communication is ultimately the problem here, and taking time and stepping back a moment may be your best hope at anything respectful in the end.|`|TPhIWWniaa	I learned long ago to listen to what the people around me had to say and to learn through other people's mistakes, granted I didn't learn this when I was your age but trust me when I say that it does work.     If you think about it these people have lived longer than you and have probably gone through what you are now going through; you are looking at this boy with the eyes of a young woman who is in love and your family is looking at him with neutral eyes, so I would take their views into consideration.     All those people can't be wrong or prejudiced against this guy, there has to be something there; after all they are your family & I would think that they want only the best for you.
58b39836778b4f8ccc1d94c29b22f1b0aa	He doesnt sound like a man to waste his time and effort. If you were not the right girl he wouldn't be with you. He has a plan and he wouldnt appreciate HIS time being wasted so I dont think he would waste yours. Dont try and rush his plan unless you have somewhere else you really need to be?  Have you tried actually asking him what his plans are concerning you? Not in an emotional state, just a calm discussion over a normal dinner. You are entitled to know if by some remote chance he ISNT planning it all with you in mind. I dont think he would have told you about it in the way he has if it wasnt you in the lead female role, but ask anyway. Dont stew on it and drive yourself nuts!  If you dont feel you can talk to him, then you've answered your own problem. You shouldnt be with someone you cant talk about serious issues with.|`|Quz9aQdyaa	I would talk, communicate, both about what his plans might be about his future with you, and also maybe find a nice way to bring up his lack of affection. Tell him you appreciate the things he does do for you, but also tell him how you feel about wanting to be close, and talk, and share feelings. Communication is never a mistake. Honesty has to exist, otherwise it's all fake. Maybe he just needs a little info from you to let him know what you desire.... Or maybe you will find out you are in fact wasting your time, but like the other person said, he sounds like a prospect for you... 10 months to some people may not be a long enough time... But talking can never hurt, it will only leave a person with more information to go on... And if someone can't talk to you, then they don't really care about your feelings... Good Luck|`|rXORvIstaa	You've done a good job reading the situation already.  No further analysis needed.  What I advise you to do is make sure you are spending time with your friends, and that you have personal goals too such as school or career.  This will give you a base of happiness in case he doesn't end up wanting to marry you.  What's more, seeing you as happy and independent apart from him will probably make him like you more.  The more you fret over it, the less he will want you.  Do not pressure him, just do the things I have advised you to do.  Don't worry about what he is or isn't going to do, its not worth the wasted energy.  Relax, and have fun with life.|`|kogsyGAPaa	When the moment is right, just subtly ask him if he loves you. He might realize that he has neglected such an important part in the relationship and feel sorry.   best wishes!|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Don't know|`|96d31d5c643374b7ec8fa40a82fc5bceaa	you need to talk about this with him, he has to be honest and straightforward. but, hm, i think it'll all be fine, just talk, talk, talk.    oh to Rocky, have you ever been in love or truly loved a man, I mean a real man?    by the way, i've read some great replies here, so by all means, be careful about your feelings towards him. if he can't be honest he doesn't deserve you.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Just open your mouth and ask him.Sounds to me like he is just too busy with everything else and hasnt taken the time to tell you how he really feels.You need to just sit down with him over dinner one night and simply ask"where is this going?" "how do you really feel about me?".Dont be afraid to ask questions and say how you feel.That is the only way to find out what you want to know.Best of luck|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think your desire to marry a man who is unaffectionate is bizarre.  You want to marry someone who doesn't give you something you need, and who, by withholding it, hurts you.  I think you should leave him, find a man who is affectionate, and let a woman who would enjoy a guy like him have him.|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	Ok.  You need to sit down and have a discussion about how his lack of affection is hurting you and you need to know where you both stand.  He is not giving you what you need most from him.  If he is not willing to try to change at all then I say cut your losses.  If you marry him it will not get any better for you. I know that you love him, but life is too short to be miserable.  You need someone who will show you affection and tell you that they love you every day.  It makes us feel special to know that we are loved and we need to hear it.  Please consider that there are good men out there that will show you affection and he may just be waiting around the corner for someone like you.|`|RlcfZAxQaa	I think you are scaring him off.    Are you worried about becoming an old spinster?    Men don't like to be pestered on such issues.|`|Apm88mVTaa	Take it from a guy.  Ask him.  Don't be shy.  If he loves you he will answer you.    But you have to think to yourself if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone that you have communication issues with...|`|iTtxlvZcaa	doin very special things  4 is a way hes showin u he loves u...why woman think just cause ur in love or u love him he has 2 marry u... its only been 10m...u have 2 want t/sames things in life prepare urself he seems 2 have his head on straight where is urs? woman always putin t/presure on men bout t/ring & marriage issue...remember he will choose u donbt make him choose|`|qut1Mze4aa	I was in this exact reltionship for about 17 months, drove me insane because I am like you, need to hear it and feel it.    We have been apart since Sept. 08 and I have dated acouple of guys who are very open with their feelings and I am realizing that to me they seem very high maintenance, I am basically dating myself and let me tell ya, I am a lot of work!    This closed off personality was very hard on me but I swear that God has put these two other men in my life to tell me something, actions do speak louder than words.  Something I never realized until recently.    You may have to ask him what his intentions are with you, it has been 10 months and depending on your age that should be enough time to get an idea of where this is going.  Not necessarily marriage talk but an idea.    Good luck!
mvKDbb2uaa	You already told your friend "Gertrude" you are going to her wedding.  In this case, I would separate and your bf should go to his sister's wedding and you to your friend's.  When asked, you can both explain the situation and everyone will understand.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well without knowing which wedding is in which city, I would pick nashville because it's the bomb!  I love it there!  but really you should go to the one you committed to first.  if your boyfriend's family puts up a fuss, just ask the bride how she would feel if you told her you could be at HER wedding and then you flaked and went to someone else's?  because that's how your friend would feel if you didn't go.  I say you go to one wedding and your bf goes to the other, you're not joined at the hip you know.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Go your seperate ways for the weekend.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Family first--ALWAYS.  If you seriously think you're going to marry this BF, you should most definitely go to his sister's wedding.  If you don't, it could cause hard feelings that will linger throughout your marriage . . . not only with the sister-in-law, but with the rest of the family who will all feel slighted if you choose a friend over the family.|`|55zWUXcUaa	You already comited to your friends wedding so you go there apologize to your b/f and his sister, but you already had the prior obligation.  They should understand.|`|w1necKzYaa	only you can make this decision!|`|cdL4wzGbaa	I would personally go to both if there in the same city.But if they are not,I would go to your friends.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Personally friend over sister in law.  If your not close to her- it really doesn't matter if she is your SIL.    Plus anyone who doesn't have open bar is rude- and I personally won't go anyways- Go to Gertrude's.    Gertrude has been your friend for how long?  And you know his sister how long?  and how close are you?  Forget the "family" thing- go to whom you are closer to.  Your boyfriend can go to his sister wedding- it's a 50/50 split.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Honor & integrity means you keep your promises, this is especially true if you are talking about a friend.  If she is in fact a "friend" (someone you care about and who you respect / cherish) and not  someone you occassionally hang out with but bad mouth when she isn't present than I would keep my promise to a her.  How would it feel to you to have a close friend say "well, I'm going to break my promise to you and not support you so I can attend the wedding of a person who I don't really know or care about".      Your boyfriend will just need to get over it and if he and his family can't then obviously this isn't an understanding family and is highly selfish.  You should think twice about becoming tied down to them.|`|5DJcir9saa	I would go to your friend's wedding and represent both you and your boyfriend, and you boyfriend can go to his sister's wedding to represent the two of you.  Don't feel bad about it!  Send well wishes to his sister and let her know that your good friend is getting married on the same day and you already made that commitment.  You're not trying to stop her brother from going, so she won't be mad!      My husband and I have had to do this before in the past.  If we're invited to two things that are important to us and we can't go to both, we split up and attend both functions.|`|J6KraUzUaa	omg that sucks.  If I were you I'd probably go to neither coz I hate weddings.  but in your situation, I think it's best to go to your friends wedding coz she announched hers the first and you already commited to ur friend.     even though your boyfriends sister will be family she might hate you for that for the rest of her life, but hey it aint ur fault.     good luck in whatever you choose...oh, and why not talk to your boyfriend and his sister about the situation and make sure to mention that ur friend announced it before and ur already commited.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You need to attend your friends wedding and your boyfriend should attend his sister's.  Be sure you speak to both women beforehand and tell them you wish you could both be at each of their weddings but are going to separate yourselves so you can be represented at both weddings.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	How good of a friend is your friend "Gertrude?"  If she is a lifelong BFF who you'd take a bullet for, go to her wedding and let your BF go alone to his sister's wedding.  If she's just more of an acquaintance than a friend, go to "Thelma's" wedding with your BF.  Family first!  And I realize you were J/K about the open bar, but I actually think that it does seem like a good incentive.  A wedding is a party, after all- if you were invited to two New Year's parties, you'd go to the one with more entertaining stuff, right?  Why should a wedding be any different?|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Unless you think his parents will be very angry with you I would just go to the friends.|`|662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	Open bar should not matter.    Try to go to both, go tho Thelma's ceremony and cocktail hour, and Gertrude's reception.    PS your boyfriend should stay at his sister's party the whole time.|`|f9ca0489c84566012f6ae440195cf6b4aa	First - who has the open bar doesn't matter.    Second - you have already told 'Gertrude' you will be attending her wedding.  You do not cancel for another event - unless it is for the illness or death of a close family member.  Third - you send your sincere regrets to your boyfriend's sister, along with a very nice present, and you attend any other pre-wedding events that you are invited to.  Like the bridal shower.  Finally - you attend Gertrude's wedding solo, your boyfriend attends his sister's wedding solo, and you two meet up afterward to share pics and stories.|`|wADnvKGFaa	OK the open bar comment is pretty shallow.........anyway, boyfriend should go to his sisters and you should go to your friends.  I see no problem here.|`|itbkP9HGaa	Definitely Gertrude, for several reasons.  1) You already told her you'd go.  2) Your bf's sister is not YOUR sister, you can skip it.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Since you've already committed yourself to your bff's wedding you must honor that commitment......your BF needs to attend his sister's wedding, however. You two are NOT engaged yet so you are not officially a potential family member so in this case his sister should understand, especially since her brother will be there for her....good luck.|`|q8eue7CRaa	You made the commitment to your friend's wedding before your boyfriend's sister was engaged. You should go to your friend's!!!    You will both be a little bummed out you're not together that day, but it happens a lot - I was in a wedding party once when my now-husband was attending a wedding for his cousin. It'll work out. It's unfortunate, but it'll be fine. :)
DHt8w4oFaa	the strip club ...or chuck e cheeses !|`|1sHBVWuKaa	take her to the motel and buy her a hooker|`|exZK0rgnaa	candle light dinner and walk in the park :D|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	take her up in a hot air balloon, pack a lunch, bring a bottle of her favorite wine,  bring a camera and take pictures of her , search online and write down some funny jokes so she laughs all day..............make her feel as though she is the only one that matters that day|`|uQswOjy9aa	Heres a tip I learned: instead of taking her out take her to your place and  cook for her or watch a movie. you will have more time to talk to her and show her you love her. at the movies you can't talk but at home you can pause the movie when you start talking. Dinner and a movie at home!!
ZPTmbQW4aa	Very simple sweetie, keep your FRIENDS close and your ENEMIES CLOSER.... she smiles and grins in your face and then talks about you about behind your back... WTF babygirl you really don't need friends like that.... The best thing you can do for  yourself is distance yourself from her and find you a new friend...     "Tell her to grow up and keep your damn name out of her mouth too while she is at it... And tell her Oh by the way... If you don't have enough balls to say the shyt to my face then don't bother saying it at all, because if she CANT say the foul things she is saying BEHIND your back to your FACE then what she has to say REALLY DON'T MATTER.... And let her know too and while she is running back talking about YOU to OTHER people what is that going to solve... THOSE other people are NOT YOU... What can THEY DO... change YOU.. WTF... tell that girl to grow up and keep your damn name out of her mouth before I have to come where you are...     Don't worry about it though girlfriend.... she is NOTHING.. more than likely she is JEALOUS of you for some reason or ANOTHER... why else can she not keep your name out of her mouth, either you are prettier, smarter, nicer, taller, thicker, or SOMETHING MORE than she is which is WHY she IS HATING ON YOU..Tell her....... DONT HATE the PLAYER hate the GAME...... Shake em off mama. She is not worth you worrying your lil head over.... You don't need people like that in your life anyway....    Remember this and never forget it ok baby......  NEVER WASTE MAJOR TIME ON MINOR PEOPLE   and the girl who is talking about you is MINOR....|`|TKA2mgFBaa	dont talk to her anymore|`|3ScWB3WDaa	I hate to break it to you, but most women are like that. I have one good friend who is a girl and we both treat our relationship as if we were boys to avoid drama. Girls tend to talk crap about eachother even their closest friends just because they CAN. Girls are taught to be that way through the media and by peers and even their parents.    The best advice I can give you is to make sure you keep personal information personal with her. If she wants to rant about petty things, thats her problem, but keep anything you DON'T want another person to know private. Because she probably would tell others.|`|kGTzG6VLaa	You are obviously a better person than she is.  I'd advise you to stop talking to her and just be cordial when you see her, but not divulge any information that could bite you if she spreads it around.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	How are you sure that these people are telling you the truth? If they're lying then their motive is probably to split you and your friend up...Especially if they are jealous of your friendship. However, if she really is talking about you behind your back then she isn't a friend because friends don't do that. Why don't you confront her yourself on a one-to-one conversation and just ask her if she really has been back chatting about you. If you know for sure that she has, then I guess its probably best to make some new friends.|`|aGXankr2aa	I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but this is typical high school BS.  What don't you do the 'mature' thing and ask why she's doing this.  If her answer isn't satisfactory, then ditch her as a friend - why waste time with a two-faced cow?|`|DHt8w4oFaa	my supposedly best friend is the SAME way...freak dat ***** =)|`|FORX7yfQaa	Confront her or just tell her off.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Confront her then cut ties.  Shes no friend of yours!|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Ah, junior high. I knew someone like that. Best thing you can do is cut all ties with her, but don't talk bad about her like she does about you - your friends who still like her might resent you for it.|`|NXwzuv3Paa	sounds like shes trying to be friends with everybody. if she downs you to them she thinks they will like her more. talk to her. just nicely tell her thats not ok.|`|Z97CVElxaa	If she is being like that they she is just 2faced you don't need friends like that and TBH the not rele friends at all if they say things behind your back|`|8h2P3Gyyaa	She is not you friend. real friends would stab you in the front not the back. You should not be friends with her anymore.|`|AtjlmByAaa	If you have enough courage, talk to her directly and ask her about it, if not try to avoid mingling with this person, she might put you in trouble.  Analyze also, how do you treat her, if you ain't seeing any wrong with how you act while w/ her, or it could possibly be an envy or jealousy issue.|`|RWffWDchaa	well then break friends with her if she keeps on doing that then find better and true friends that won't do all those stuff to you|`|eQ5ieDbUaa	Go tell her off! I'd go make sure she said that before telling her off though.|`|HiJE6Gqgaa	shes not a real friend if she does that kind of crap. bite back and start a rumor about her and drop her  stupid ***.|`|JyAoZxA5aa	avoid her and do the same thing to her... she deserves it|`|1vwtntnZaa	Confront her about it. Ask her whats her deal when you guys are alone and if she acts different see what happens. Try and see if she will hang out with you and some of your friend and some of her friends and see how different she acts. But when it comes down to it, if she is talking smack she isn't even a friend. You'd be known as an acquaintance and she only associates with you when its convenient for her. She is not worth you're time.|`|UDX3qgy5aa	ditch her  if shes just using you se=he obviously doesnt appreciate you    tell her i say shes nasty ;)|`|OdhxEb5iaa	I used to go through this sort of thing a lot during high school...  My best advice would be to confront her, if possible, and ask her if what her other friends are saying is true..  Or if that's not possible.. like if she's one of the popular girls or something.. I'd look at it this way..    Does this girl know you?  Does she understand you?  Does she know things that only your closest friends would know?    If not, then she doesn't know you enough to have the right to hurt you by talking like that behind your back. So whatever she says becomes invalid, meaning it has no truth to it. It can't harm you. Get what I mean?    Feel free to msg me if you want to talk more! :-)    Cheers!|`|DMKh4wtWaa	If you are ever in the company of all four people including her, I would ignore her in front of everyone to the point of being rude, and maybe even embarrass her by saying that you need to tell them all something important, and then just repeat the stuff she said about you to everyone. You can be creative with it :) After that, I would just cut her off. Good luck!|`|UTxA4F8maa	If she talks about you behind your back with out you knowing then she's not a real friend. I would confront her and see what her explanation is, but to be honest, there is no excuse for talking about a "friend," behind their back. I would go your separate ways.
6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	Perhaps it's time to step back and allow him room to step up to the plate.  See how it goes and if you are unhappy with the result you need to do what works for you without spending anymore of yourself.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	I really think it depends on how old you two are. I mean if your still in high school or below then anniversaries or similar dates will be the least of his concern. It's just not something most guys focus on during the adolescent years (unless they are trying to be Mr. romantic).     Fix: Tell him how much celebrating these events mean to you and how you feel when he doesn't acknowledge them. Communication really is the key... too many people waste time on assuming the other party feels the same way they do about things verses just letting them know how they feel. -and knowing is half the battle.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i knew of a woman in ohio who married a man who was married to someone else, the girl had no idea, and still had to go through a divorce herself, so her marriage was valid. she might be able to get him for being married too someone else at the same time, bigamy. really depends on the state u live in, as states do have different laws. but u will need an attorney, and if the man has some money some attorney may take the case if theres money involved.sometimes bad things happen to good people, and an innocent person gets hurt.depends on how the judge sees it. he might have to pay u some alimony just depends on the laws. your best bet would be to find an attorney who would be willing to take it and be willing to wait to get his money.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	If he was still married than your marriage is invalid. Never happened      Eat Funyuns.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	You could and the court could award you damages.    Sometimes its just better to close the chapter and move on. There are several assistance programs out there that can help you. Contact the local welfare office.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	you don't need to ask for a divorce. you simply file one. doesn't matter what he says. second, if the divorce wasn't final before your marriage, you don't even have a valid marriage. seems he has himself in a pickle here. so file girlfriend|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Consult a lawyer for legal options|`|ojqWNSJMaa	Yes, first there are legal aids that can help you, and they are free.   Second have him arrested for bigamy. Just because he got a divorce doesn't excuse the fact that he broke the law.   You didn't mention what state you were married in, or where you live now, but most states have a law that gives half of all property to both husband and wife. (So whatever he owns now, you own half of, by law) So if you file for a divorce you are entitled to half of everything he now owns.    Have him arrested for possession of drugs, when you know he has them.   If you know that he is driving, and under the influence of alcohol or drugs , have him arrested.   Bottom line, the more you can prove what a looser this guy is the better it will go for you in a court of law.  God Bless and good luck.|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	DON'T DO IT ITS ILLEGAL|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	This is one of those tricky cases that can only be answered by a lawyer.  I suggest you seek out a good one.|`|AA11631715	bigamy in most states is an actionable crime, you can contact law enforcement and swear out a complaint. Since you've waited so long, the statute of limitations may preclude that, you'd have to ask them. If he has resources (bar and restaurant) that are recoverable, a civil case would also be in order, for which you could hire an attorney on contingency (only gets paid if you win.)  Good luck.|`|2272ee843f475a18e80ab4395dd15fd0aa	You definitely have a right to take him to court for a marriage under false pretenses, i would make that asshole pay for what he has done to you. Are y'all divorced yet or separated, because if y'all are still married then you should have rights to the rest and bar he just bought as well as him having to pay you spousal support. i would take him to the cleaners if i were you after making you live such a bad life of lies and deceit.|`|Sn9KZ8ANaa	Based on your description, there are certainly damages to you that he caused.  Even if you weren't legally married, you can be awarded alimony based on the time together.  Try to find a lawyer who will take your case on a contingency basis, i.e. he gets a portion of what he wins for you, usually a third, but only if you win.  You don't have to pay anything if you lose.  See the source for futher information.
AA11990465	If you want the divorce, just sign the papers and get it over with. What difference does it make what the grounds for the divorce are anyway.     I would suggest that if there is anything you want to keep from the marriage that isn't in your name, for instance a vehicle, you get an attorney and fight for it or you will end up with absolutely nothing.|`|izbAdDUraa	get yourself a lawyer ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Well an uncontested divorce does not mean you don't have kids or assets. It simply means its a no fault divorce that both parties agree on.   A contested divorce means that one party disagrees and is fighting something about it.   If he wants to file for divorce using abandonment its considered a fault based divorce, these require proof. This means he will have to provide concrete proof to the court stating your abandonment. If he cannot do this, then the judge will not allow such a divorce and he will be forced to change it.|`|cdjLVZHraa	Most states require that there be grounds for an uncontested divorce.  The choices are usually adultery, cruelty or abandonment.  So, of those three, I think abadonment is probably the best choice.    This except is from a divorce site:  In order to start an uncontested divorce, state laws will ask that the couple must have grounds for a divorce. Grounds are another way of saying a valid reason for the uncontested divorce, as authorized by the laws of the pertaining state. While the state laws are constantly under review, and revisions are always in the legislature pending approval, some of the following reasons are currently accepted in some states:     Adultery is one of the main grounds for an uncontested divorce in most states. Separations in the form of desertion for at least 12 months, or 18 months of continuous separation, with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation are grounds for uncontested divorce.     Forms of extreme cruelty defined as any physical or mental cruelty that endanger the safety or health of the plaintiff or make it improper or unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to continue to live together with the defendant, as well as drug addiction or habitual drunkenness for a period of 12 or more consecutive months are grounds for an uncontested divorce.     Additional grounds for an uncontested divorce include institutionalization for mental illness for a period of 24 or more consecutive months, imprisonment of the defendant for 18 or more consecutive months, and deviant sexual conduct voluntarily performed by the defendant without the consent of the plaintiff.     Hope this helps

I am a happy housewife, and my husband is happy for me to be one as well. So he is the only one who brings in income, however after he got out of the service and didn't have a job for a couple months and I worked to make ends meet, the money that I brought in was definitely his money too.  We just prefer it this way with me at home and him at work.|`|2rsiKfj7aa	Yes, I believe that everything, money included, is split 50/50. What is his is mine and mine is his.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	It's the both of your money..enjoy|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Iam traditional, I keep care of the money and the wife keeps care of the lil ones.   The law covers divorce mostly, but as far as marriage goes, just look for somebody you are compatible with.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I do believe that... but I also believe that money is a responsibility that you share, and that means that you have to agree on the major purchases and you have a say in each others spending habits if they are detrimental to the long term goals of your marriage.|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	When you marry, you bow to become one. And that is in everything|`|AA11990465	Yes, and that is how it should be. Our bills get paid by both of us and we don't keep track of who pays what. It takes both of our incomes to keep the house running.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Well most woman seem to like that idea because its men who usually make more money.  Although i tend to disagree with that idea because what i work for is mine.  And you don't become one because their is still 2 people with different views.   All of the sudan we are not one when she is on her period or having a bad day, so i don't believe in the we are one idea either.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	To a degree but I'm also respectful of the fact that any money she  brings into the marriage came from her hard work.  As such, I would never be irresponsible with "our" money or make large purchases with-out her consent and I would hope she would extend me the same courtesy.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	yes,as well as his body,is my body lol|`|29hcn9JRaa	That depends on how long someone has been married for, if it was a short lived marriage, less then 10 years, a person deserves whatever they invested during the course of the marriage. I think if a husband or wife had a lengthy marriage, over 10 years and over 20 for sure, and if their income is way less then their spouse, then sure they should be provided for, for a short time, I think this is called temporary spousal support? However simply just because you married someone does not make a person entitled to their assets and money after the marriage has ended, this of course is assuming they even have any money, as the money must first be their to take.|`|AA11089617	Yes. His money is no longer his is ours and mine is not mine it is ours.|`|c8618f07576acf7f0719396bada43c4baa	yes i think it is rude when people dont share with their spuse|`|58b39836778b4f8ccc1d94c29b22f1b0aa	No. If you cant stand on your own two feet then what do you bring to the relationship?|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Absolutely.Whats his is mine and whats mine is his.;)|`|k4yz6Y2Laa	Most women feel this way unless they have more money.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	seeing as he likes me to be a stay at home mom,, it better be mine too.|`|4gEU73sAaa	Yes, I do agree with this.  Before my husband and I got married, we shared our money.  When it came to paying bills, entertainment, etc.  We shared our money.  After we were married and my last name was the same as his, we added me to his checking account and closed mine.  We have always shared the money and that is the way it will be forever.  You have to understand the laws in the state that you live in, also.  Where we live, every bit of his debt is shared by me, even if my name is not on the account that the debt is in.  For example, his vehicle is, solely, in his name.  If we got divorced tomorrow, that debt would also be mine.|`|2272ee843f475a18e80ab4395dd15fd0aa	In a way yes and in a way no, if you think about it would you want him to have access to your money as well. this is something that y'all need to sit down and discuss. Money and Fiances are one of the biggest divorce breakers in this life today. Y'all need to make some compromises and come together on this one. It will all work out in the end and he may see eye to eye with you.|`|AA12159712	That's the way it's supposed to work. But some couples enter into agreements on how to share the costs associated with marriage and living together and who pays what bills or how much. In states that recognize community property laws, it makes it quite clear that bills and costs and income are shared in a marriage.|`|YyVGXt83aa	My money and money we didn't have was hers.  I have 4+ years of debt after she cut and ran.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Partially, just as mine would be his.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	HELL YES!
x0vMl42jaa	I did this with Snapfish- http://www1.snapfish.co.uk/howitworks  and it worked really well- we put our wedding photos on and sent them to our guests, and asked that they share theirs, and everybody loved it.

You can upload 200 hi-res photos free, if you want more than that then it is $30 a year.|`|AA12159712	You give them the Kodak or Shutterfly or whatever website you designate to do so, get them a username and password, and let them do so. It's either that, or have a computer available at the reception so they can load them in before they leave the reception.|`|1773af5b16b4810abead8fb4f772cbd3aa	Use The Wedding Lens - http://www.theweddinglens.com    It lets all your guests upload and download full-res photos to a single album.  It's wedding focused and easy to use.
mAPSl0DZaa	B I think would be best. Unfortunately we live in a disposable society who no longer values love commitment etc. Be greatful if it is at the level of BF/GF and not a spouse. You cant not make someone love you but as long as you love yourself you will be ok.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	You should be scared, you have a son you have never met! he is 2|`|xGshAiXOaa	B    If you have to 'regain' someone's love, who's to say it won't be 're-lost' and you'll be in constant struggle trying to make someone love you?|`|3vbHZBioaa	Honestly do you really believe he fell out of love...or is it that like every other couple in the world you get busy with living like work, bills, kids and didn't find time for each other.

I thought I fell out of with my fiancee but I didn't, I was stressing and neglecting him. Just Give it some Space and Time.    SPACE AND TIME, SERIOUSLY.     Then you'll have time to think and reflect and if you dont love him after you sort your feelings tell him to move along.|`|NqbBjS0raa	The choice is not limited to just you it must be mutual between two people to work it out if one wants to stay and one is unsure. Force isn't an option. Trying to talk about the problems or feelings help and counselors having made some strides in that area of communication between two spouses. Desire to leave might not be because of love or feelings but something else that is nagging at a person. It is a combination of both answers but with outside help to get the unknown problem out in the open if there is one.....|`|woPLfLQbaa	First you need to know the difference between "in love" and "love". I believe that "in love" feeling you think you feel at the beginning of a new relationship is more of a "lust", "novelty" feeling than anything else. To truly love a person is to enjoy every part of them including but not limited to their likes, dislikes, parts of them you dont like and parts you do, and comprimising to have a relationship. you can always date others and / or a an intimate relationship with however it takes "work" at all times to have a successful long term healthy relationship.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You cannot ever force love, it either is or it isn't and once it goes it never comes back which pretty much leaves you with one choice: Get over it.|`|nyylb6qUaa	If your bf gf or spouse falls out of love with you, then there is a reason why. If this has happened to you, then my heart goes out to you. Find the reason why the love is gone.

May God Bless You, and Good Luck.|`|8txWayVnaa	B.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I would probably chain him to a chair and lock him in the basement until he came to his senses.      Not!- B|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Both a. and b. are true.  You can influence others' feelings by the way you treat them.  You cannot, indeed, "control" them.  Attempting to control another person is generally futile.  Persuasively influencing someone often works, though.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	B of course.  Because if I truly loved them, then I would want them to be happy no matter what....even if that meant they weren't with me.  Yea, it would be heart breaking and hard as hell, but if that was what would make them happy....then it I would step aside and let them go.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	B|`|2272ee843f475a18e80ab4395dd15fd0aa	I would say to let him go cause if the love is really there he/she will come back, don't push it because it will just make them miserable which in turn will make you miserable as well. if you love them let them go. there are many fish in the sea and maybe he/she is not the right one for you, you will meet your true love one day.
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You should pay only what you can afford, whether it's $300 or $30,000. Only you will know what you can comfortably afford to spend. Don't go into debt over it but don't get take in by a low price for poor quality either. Make sure whatever you get you get all of your inspections, certificates and warranties along with insurance information. Try a small, private importer, they are very good at getting the best quality for the budget you have and the cutsomer service is unsurpassed.    Good luck!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	There is no exact price, some say its got to be 2 or 3 months salary for you but thats just baloney, do what you can afford and no more.  Take her with you for her to pick, you will worry all the time whether the ring you have chosen is the right one for her so pop the question and tell her you are spending the whole weekend with her to get her the ring she wants.  good luck.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	It depends on where you buy it at.The EXACT same ring Wal Mart has for $500 will cost you $1200 at the mall.|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	The diamond industry will tell you 2 or 3 months salary but really it depends more on your budget. Don't get less than 1/2 carat.|`|AA11603468	It's too much when you can't save that much in a year. For some that amount would be a whole lot less than for others.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	More than you can afford is too much for an engagement ring.    For me and my circle of friends we all have about AU$5000 rings, all of varying size and quality but they were all about the same price. That is how much our men could afford (and seems to be the average here).|`|4lL34wJnaa	The old rule is a couple months salary.  THAT HAS CHANGED!  Now the rule is buy what you can afford.  Don't take out a loan or go into debt over a piece of jewelry!  I know my fiance put aside some money every week for months before he bought my ring.  Buy what you can afford.  If she really loves you, the size/material of the ring won't matter.    I love my .75 carat F/VS1 heart-shaped yellow gold solitaire ring!    Also, make sure you take time to educate yourself about the type of ring you want to buy.  Believe it or not Amazon.com has some great information in their create a ring section.  When you create a ring, you can click on every link to find out what the terminology means.  Most places will only tell you about the all important 4-C's, but there's a lot more to a diamond than just that!  You should look at girdle, culet, fluorescence, etc.  Educate yourself before purchasing, so you don't get ripped off!|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	if you have to pay more than the cost of a box of cracker jacks then it is to much|`|cdL4wzGbaa	3000 dollars is the most I would spend.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Its too much when you need to finance it.  Buy what you can afford.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	If you are still paying for the ring after you get married, then you have definitely paid TOO much. You should not carry the debt over into your marriage. They say a month's gross salary is usually within range. So it is what you can afford. However "big" it is, it is a promise of your love.  Good luck to you both!|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I recommend sticking within your budget.  If you cannot afford to buy the ring right there, then it is too much.  Can't give you a dollar amount because that is different for every person.  While one person may be able to throw down $10k on a ring, another may only be able to do $500.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	everyone already said what I what I was going to say.   Just set a budget and stick to it when you shop.    I would try to stay away from walmart or mall stores, though. They typically do not have the best for your money.  I have not been impressed with what I saw there when shopping for earrings.     Just do not go into debt. My fiance paid for my ring outright and it is a relief that he does  not have  big payments.|`|wvhoS7WDaa	3 months of the males salary or less not a penny more|`|nujen4dmaa	Setting a budget first is a bit difficult unless you already are already knowledgeable about diamonds and how much they sell for.    This link will help you get started with the diamond knowledge.http://www.whiteflash.com/diamonds_info/...    Once you have some knowledge under your belt, go into a retail store and ask to see some diamonds in person.. Take no CASH on this endeavour.  Don't be swayed by the sales person behind the counter.  Make your own decisions about what color and clarity you can live with.  Get some prices and come back online to find the BEST CUT diamond within your decided budget.    IdealD|`|2ac10106c0b1d6c0f702c4d23002e3b7aa	dont worry about what cost someone tells you on here. just go off and get a ring that you thinks she will like.. if she knows you asked someone else about the cost of a ring she would be horrid that you came on here and asked the question|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Average is $800 - $2500    Can cost from $450 - $500,000 or more.    I think its about $1100 to $1700 is what most spend.    Best of Luck!!|`|8QOlaQWgaa	It is all about your finances and what you can afford...and what your life style is accustomed to.  Ex.  One couple we hang w/ can't afford much and her ring is really small and probably cost $150 from the pawn shop.  Another couple we hang with has a 2.5 karat an dI have no clue how much it cost.  Don't start out in debt b/'c you think she has to have a huge ring.  We are getting married in May and I still have no ring! Lol|`|HCgNSgKBaa	Really anything that forces you to be broke and you really can't afford it. Buy something in your means, and when you pick it out, pick out something you think she will really like, not just how big it is. It is flat out a lie that all women ( I am sure there are some) that only care about how big their ring is. Make sure it is from the heart|`|zRil0vjhaa	Congrats! Etiquette states that the amount of the bride's ring should be equivalent to three months of the groom's salary.|`|xkB4AiuAaa	They say that the engagement ring should be the cost of around 3 months pay - but that is a very out dated tradition.  I would say that "too" much would be buying a ring that will put you in a financially difficult position. while I understand that you probably want to get her the most amazing ring, if you can't afford it and you will struggle afterwards, will it really be worth it?  Money issues are some of the biggest issues between couples so you don't want to start your engagement/marriage on the wrong foot!  As long as you can afford the ring with out a struggle then I think that is the perfect amount to spend!
54GBWTgoaa	wow you two look like bro and sis defiantly lol, but me and my half brother look alike but are my full blooded sister >>> we are opposites!!!|`|aXYiOskmaa	we all look alike. recently, i met someone who new my brother but i had never met. he knew right away who i was without even being introduced. the only one of us who looked any different was my sister. she was the only one of us who seemed to take after our mom a bit more.   yep, you and your bro definitely look alike|`|Jj30buLMaa	I dont think so at all, very different colouring.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	Yes, you look very much alike.  People say that my brother and I look very much alike as well, though I never really see it.

We do have the same set of parents.|`|89TgOjXpaa	You look identical  could pass as twins :)|`|RIVywiykaa	you look as closs as a tiny rats *** to a tiny rats feet|`|OFaZ9SSDaa	Hey!! I think you two have always looked alike. Granted I have seen him in years, but you still look that same as you did 15 years ago!! WOW...that's a long time!  Since you know me and my sisters, you be the judge. I think Heather and I look more alike, but we are full blood sisters (technically).

This isn't tattling or ratting out someone, this protecting her before she gets seriously hurt or killed.  she needs someone to intervene and an adult would have more experience and resources to help here.    if you know her parents then you need to go to her parents' home and tell them what is going on.    she's in no shape to have any kind of relationship with anyone because right now she's involved with a violent person and she's refusing to leave him.|`|3PFJGzzsaa	just beat her bf up! then say i did it 4 you.|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	Here's Your Game Plan.    1.

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	The experts say 6-9 months in advance is the absolute earliest you should send the Save the Dates.  I sent mine about 10 months in advance, though, because I'm getting married over Labor Day weekend, and holiday weekends tend to have their own set of rules, since people make plans way in advance for them sometimes, and hotels book up faster, and all of that.  Since June 5 is a nice, normal, holiday-free day, you should probably send them out around Christmas and you'll be fine.  If you want to give the out-of-towners some more advance notice, you can send them out around October-ish, but they really won't need more notice than that, probably.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Around 9 months before the wedding. Invitations go out around 8 weeks before the big day.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	9 months to 1 year in advance is appropriate, especially for people who may have to make travel plans.  We sent ours out just under a year in advance.|`|FVFxE6owaa	Save the dates should be sent out between 6 to 12 months before the wedding so yes, sending them out in December 2009 should be plenty of time.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I would do nine months at the earliest especially if you have family they may need to approval from work to be gone. You can do 6 months if you feel it will be enough time for people!|`|AA11961524	I think that three or four months in advance should be enough time.    Congratulations.|`|kc68BXwTaa	You can let people know the date if they need to make travel arrangements before sending out "save the date" cards.    I'd say do 9 months, because sometimes people plan vacations in June (especially college students, if you're young).|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	6-12 months|`|4lL34wJnaa	My fiance and I are not doing Save-the-Dates, but everything I have been told is 6-8 months before your wedding date.
r5wK05N5aa	Snap! I guess he did see us last week ;)|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think he was complimenting you in an awkward way.|`|f6YsGOynaa	He wants you to develop a bisexual side so you'll bring a girlfriend home for him to bang.|`|nceIGfCBaa	I have no idea but this question is AWESOME!!!    DRAGON 2012  "Great fortune for U.S."|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Uh so many men do this and I think it is because they feel they cant satisfy you and they think its not me she must be gay...or...he's trying to get to you bring in a lady..men are seriously from Mars.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	Maybe he feels insecure. And he is trying to make you feel as bad as he does. Try letting him know ur not better than him,, even if you are. It may make him feel better.|`|FzFSzilmaa	no idea...    perhaps he wants you to pursue your same-sex experimentation... go to a gay bar, find a really attractive woman and take her home for some fun and exclude him... ;)|`|AA12159712	There is none. some women are more skilled at sex either naturally or by what they have learned. That does in no way make you a Lesbian. You only would be considered such if you had no desire to have sex with men and only did it with women. Maybe he's fantasizing that you would invite in a lesbian to have sex with you while he either watched or participated with you and her.|`|wzEfAVP2aa	he is insecure!|`|4U1822AXaa	lol! My husband tries to convince me I''m a lesbian too, sometimes.     Wishful thinking maybe?|`|AA11683646	I have to ask,  What exactly was it that drew you to him?    Does he say a little prayer every day with thanks for you?|`|fGE7hL12aa	Well, If you have a certain set of skills, (and I am sure you do!), and you couldn't have learned them from another guy, then there would have to be a lesbian in your past somewhere. The logic is irrefutable.    We could delve into this much further, but then I wouldn't be able to concentrate at work for the rest of the day. Maybe we can pick this up again over the weekend.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Unless you husband has different anatomy than other men, I have no idea what he is talking about.  I could understand wishing you were bi, to allow you to experience the love of another woman, maybe for his own viewing pleasure.  My wife is bi and has a friend that comes to dinner on occasions, I really understand why my wife likes her, she is funny and has a wonderful personality.  I have never demanded that I watch or take part of their friendship, I think it is wonderful that my wife has her in her life along with myself and the kids.  But, what your husband is saying, does not make any sense to me.  So, go out and find you a female friend, and bring her home to meet your husband, then let us know what he is really wanting.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	may be an indirect way of letting you know he has desires to invite another woman wiht you guys in the bedroom. I dont know though?|`|RBQrgByeaa	Were you tying cherry stems into heartshapes with your tongue again? Show off!|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Hmm, me thinks some field work is required. Show me what skills he is talking about!|`|ICLekd2Vaa	damn girl!!! he wants a 3way!!!!|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Your husband is paranoid - tell him that.|`|5boLbxzdaa	I got nothing.  I see no reason to believe you're a lesbian LOL.  If he thinks you're better at sex than he is...then tell him practice makes perfect.  :)|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	He's an idiot!  (Or trying to get you into a threesome.)  Instead of complaining, I'd just enjoy myself.  To heck with where you learned your skills!|`|NBDLUOkiaa	He says you have skills that is so cool, I am curious as hell to know what that means!|`|SS1FFafRaa	ummm......yeah, i got nothing.    unless you all are having threesomes with other girls and you're especially good at munching carpet, I have no idea what he's trying to say.
AA10610878	so do it... no pain,no gain.........|`|Ukgl64pSaa	If you are comfortable with him you should not have a problem telling him how you feel|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Either tell him or you don't.You never know what could have happened if you don't.And if says no then he isn't for you obviously.You'll find someone better.So id just walk up to him and say i like you.|`|Y2sDswLBaa	You need to get him into a deep conversation and then it will come up on its own.|`|jCdY2R42aa	say "hey i like you"|`|DtEnHza6aa	play with him..  him him in some form of touching one another..  play jokes with him  talk to him..|`|C8TEMAvzaa	well personally i love when the girl just comes out and tells me that way i'm not guessin the entire time...but heres what you can do...like others have said, do the little tickle games or something just flirt around alot that will usually end in some kind of "couple position" from anything like holding hands to your/his arm around you etc....and when your there just kinda look at him and be like..i'm really starting to like you!|`|CPnPPKjWaa	Send him an e-card?|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	well if you really like him then you just need to tell him but if you want him to find out then you play of game that i like to call your secret crush by leaving him clues about you and when he found out then you tell him when he ask you are you my crush then you tell how bad you got a crush but if you don't want to tell then ask your friends to tell him cause they will make him tell the truth about liking you cause more an likely he likes you back but you just don't know
lkNJNnlSaa	It will brighten up for you i'm sure.    I know it's easy to say this, but you will eventually move on - your bound to be hurt from what has happened recently.    All the Best    God Is love.|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Aw hun, I feel really sorry for you.    On the 2nd January my fiance finished with me and said he didn't love me anymore. I moved back to my mums and out of the house we had lived in together for just under a year. A week later I saw him out with another girl, this absolutely devastated me cos still to this day I love him and I used to truely believe we'd be together forever. So I know how you must be feeling on the fiance front.    About your dog, I'm really sorry to hear that. Just find some comfort in the fact that your dog spent 11 happy years with you and that he's safe now.    I know it might feel like the end of the world but please don't give up. Fill your days with work/studying and see plenty of your friends and family. Go for meals, out clubbing and shopping to try and take your mind off things. Eventually you will feel better and time really is a healer.  Talk to a close friend or family member for support and just remember, it obv wasn't meant to be with u and ur guy.  x|`|CowJLy9Jaa	And you think we have all the answers on a website, all us strangers!!1    If you have family, stick close to them, they will always help you through it!|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	Please do not think you will be heartbroken forever, although it seems you will never overcome this grief, you really will.    My best friend went through the exact same circumstances as you a few years ago. Her fiance cheated on her twice with another friend and then broke up with her, not long after, her dog had to be put down, whom she loved immensely.   She was at my house crying and hyperventilating for days on end, all I could do was listen to her. However, after a couple of weeks, she began getting stronger and would not cry as much. It's the cycle of grief that you are experiencing and the stage you're at now is the worst part of the cycle. However, you will naturally move forward. You might start to feel angry, resentment, pity.   My friend has now had a steady partner for 1 and half years and she said that her ex fiance's cheating has made her a stronger person and she is thankful that she found out and learnt from it. She was 20 too at the time.     So I guess what I'm trying to say is, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Time heals all wounds and you have to go through this grief cycle to come out the other end. Your life is far from over, you must concentrate on you now. You have our own life to live and you will go far. Best wishes and hold your head up high.|`|0udjgaoBaa	You are only 20, you will love again and I bet you will say to yourself why did I waste my time with that jerk anyway?....Maybe shift your focus on something else are you in school? If not nows a time to go back who knows you may meet someone knew...I was with someone for 7 years that I met when I was 17 and it was hard when we broke up but I dated alot, no I didnt sleep with every guy I dated but it helped me get over him..With your dog he was probably in pain and now he doesn't have to suffer anymore...Get a new puppy im sure it will make you smile.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Well you cannot lose hope, The Most High is there with you and he knows, and he will help you through any struggles, especially if none of it is your fault, you just have to ask patiently and you will recieve plently, you also have family i'm sure, bond with them, Sophie X you are still very young, don't let a guy hold you back from living your life, Any guy who cheats on their woman is not worth a tear, farless heartach... well ask for your dog, sorry about him/her.. i understand that having a pet for 12 years and it passing away, that could be very hard, but if you just continue to live your life with the right morals, you will probably have to make room for your blessings.|`|JbWGwAFXaa	Sophie dear, I had all this happen to me this year. Not all at the same time thank god. My beloved dog of 16 years passes away before xmas. The grieving process is difficult, but I promise It does get better!! It hurts for a little while, and shedding a few tears for him does help. He is in a better place and you obviously loved him very much.   As for your fiance, what luck you found out before you married him and fell even deeper in love with him, or had children with him. I know this is a heartbreak,but i promise that you will get over it, please do not feel like you cannot cope. Your family support system is the best you will ever had!! Counselling is always a help..i promise.|`|VeJH9b2yaa	i am guessing you are feeling rejected because of your fiance leaving and also abandoned because your dog has pass away and left you. Unfortunately dogs/pets do not live as long as us. i can understand how much pain and hurt you will be from your dog dying BUT you must tell yourself that you loved him very much and gave him a fantastic life. his time has run out so let him rest in peace. as for your fiance. yes he will find it much easier to move on because he found the strength and audacity to do this BEFORE ending the relationship with you. You have to tell yourself that this man has no respect for you and just ;eave him to continue with his dishonest life. you are still very young and sound like a lovely girl. dont you have any mates who you can hook up with more often? throw yourself into your mates, work, interests. it will take some months to get over being cheated on but eventually you will get over it. DONT let this man char your thoughts and trust in other men. not all men are the same. and dont compare either. i know you were intending on marrying this guy but not all men will be like him. go out, date again, build your confidence up. you will then look back in say... 5 years time and think... jeez what a pr*** i got engaged to!!!! and you will also look back and think 'i had a dog and and he was my life'' by then you may have another one!|`|n5G5IIbOaa	Aw sweetie, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your dog. It's always so so hard when you lose a pet (I remember when my cat whom I had known since I was born died and I was devastated), but you can be glad and proud that you have given him a happy life. You will probably be understandably upset for quite a while, but things will get better.    As for your fiance, I can't imagine how hard that must be for you. Just think that it's good you are rid of him if he was willing to cheat on you and at least you know what kind of person he is before you were married.  If he has moved on then just think that the girl he is with now is with a man who is willing to cheat on his fiance, poor her.    I know things seem so bad right now but the only way is up right?? Try spending lots of time outdoors (usually helps) and find something to occupy you whether it be work, a new hobby or anything. It's your life and you can do whatever you want with it, think of this as a fresh start. Go out and have fun with your friends, you are only 20 and have so much to live for. And I can guarantee you will find a good man out there who will love you 10 times more than your fiance. All of this will in time make you stonger.    I wish you the world of luck babe xxx|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	Listen to the song "Bless the broken Road" by rascal flatts..  or the song "The way it is" by Tesla  every broken heart you get in life is like a shining star showing you the way to your TRUE LOVE,,he is out there waiting for you..Love will find you again for sure..I gurantess it..  you are hurting and that why they say Love Hurts..

Then you want to deal with the most loving thing ( the dog) let's get real here, dogs have a shorter life span than humans and we have to expect to deal with their passing. As for your other issue just remember him for what he really was, a cheater it shouldn't be hard to get over him, just don't blame yourself for his actions.

2IuoHrjQaa	I am so sorry for your loss.. on account of your dog. A pet is part of the family, when my cat died (aged 14), i was so heartbroken, i cried till i could`nt cry anymore.. someone said to me, that he was happy and he loved me and i gave him a good life... i`ll tell you the same.   With respect to your no good for nothing, dirty stop out, fiance... be glad you found out what a complete waste of space he is now, rather than you getting married to him, had kids and a home. You will go through different stages of sadness, pain, sadness, loss, guilt, anger, but i promise, time heals and on both counts you will come out from the other side... stronger!|`|ObJTgBafaa	I think you need to have a night out with your girlfriends to cheer you up.      If you're still feeling down about your dog then buy a new one.|`|HvOuJjDyaa	Losing a pet is like losing a part of your family. It is horrible, you are never ready for it and it takes time to heal. Let yourself cry (for days if necessary -- I did), don't feel bad for grieving and let the people who love you support you. Your family will be grieving for your dog too -- even if they don't show it in the same way as you -- and you can all help each other by sharing your feelings. That said, it will get better, so although you feel awful now, you won't feel that way forever.    To help yourself cope, you need time and maybe after a while you could consider getting another dog -- don't feel guilty for that. It doesn't replace your old dog, but it does replace the 'gap' in the dynamic of your family.  The new dog would be a totally different character to the old one, and you will love it in a different way which is totally OK.    With regard to your fiancee, it is very difficult as I imagine you are feeling a whole lot of feelings like betrayal and, where you were probably just about coping before, now you feel it's too much. Again, time will help and you can try and recover by making some positive steps towards putting him behind you. Bad things happen and all you can do is learn from them and move on -- take up a new hobby, join the gym, move jobs or take up work as a volunteer. This might help you to feel like you are moving forward and away from the bad experience. And, though it sounds callous, like somoene else on here said, it might help to try and think how lucky you are that you weren't even more committed, with kids etc -- you are still young and there's plenty of time to find happiness elsewhere.    Although it's difficult, remember that these two events that both cause sadness are separate issues and you need to try and stop them getting on top of you and wearing you down. Hope this might be helpful and you feel better and better as the days and weeks go by.|`|ee132737d0e2aeb1472848f439feaf8aaa	I am so sorry for both things. As crazy as it may sound to some people, the death of a pet hurts. Your doggy will always be in your heart and memories. About your ex well he lost a good thing. Obviously your a sensitive girl and im supposing very sweet. Look hun things arent gonna look better tomorrow or even two months from now. Your going through your depressed stage. All girls go through this. Just try to go out with friends and occupy your time. The good thing is that your only 20 and you have your whole life ahead of you. Throw a big old celebration for your 21st bday or atleas go out and try to have fun. When you do that just remember that your only barely getting ready to start having fun. There are many great things to come later on. Just dont try to lock your self up in your room and not come out. Even if its painfull to go out and you cant have fun at the beginning i promis that slowly and without noticing that will change..hey it happened to me. I kept going out with friends even though i was bummed. One day i realized i was smiling alot. It happened i was happy again and single. Turns out he did me a favor when he left me. I become stronger and wasnt so naive. I had enjoyed life and had learned more about my self:) Dont worry i promise you'll get over it and you'll see that he did you a favor. Can you imagine if you would have been married and then found out about the cheating?? You seriously dogded a bullet on that one. Well hope all goes well for you. So remember dont lock your self in your room and cry your eyes out. And try to go out.   Hope this helps. Good luck|`|pTSk4O8Aaa	maybe just look at this website!!!!    http://www.sexyemilie.com/?id=1278065|`|DTWJJ73Paa	I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your dog, I know how that feels, I lost a dog a few years ago, you never forget them, but I promise you, time is a great healer, it will get a little easier as time goes on. You have had a lot to cope with for someone so young, but as these things happen we do get stronger, this is why as we get older we can cope a little better when these things are thrown at us. As for your fiance, you are better off without him, give it time you will meet someone that will treat you the way you deserve to be treated. You need to talk to someone, family or friends it makes you feel so much better, if this is not possible, i'm no expert on organisations that help with this, the only one I know is the samaritans, you could give them a call, I know they would help you. I promise your heart will heal in time.
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	I think 18 is way too young.  According to the law, 18 is an adult, but you still have a lot of growing to do at 18.  I know that I came out of college a VERY different person than I was when I entered college.  Those years between high school and early 20's are extremely formative.    This is when you start to really do things on your own, and get a clearer picture of what you want out of life, and what you want out of the person you spend the rest of your life with.  If you're married at 18, it can set up some big conflicts in yourself as you grow.  I'm not saying it will never work, I'm just saying you should wait until you're older, and really know what you want out of life.  Just wait.  If it's meant to be, you'll still be together when you're ready.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Okay my suggestion is that you wait a year or two. At 18, you're still learning and changing. I got married at 20 and that was rough. I still had a lot to learn about life and the real world and my relationships with other people, including my husband. It's possible that things can work out, but it's just very hard when you're young.    Same thing about having a kid at a young age. If you won't change your mind about the birth control thing, then you're going to get pregnant if you get married and have sex.    I suggest that you talk to him and tell him you will still be there to get married later on. Get each other some of those promise rings or whatever they are called. Don't let him pressure you. If he's giving you an ultimatum then he's a jerk! Do you really want to be married and pregnant at 18? It will make life very hard.    EDIT:  "um omg some of you guys cant be serious. of course ive had sex .... im a freaking teenager."    So you have this dumb idea that birth control is bad, while you go around having unmarried sex, but yet you don't want to be pregnant? Reaaal smart...remember you only have yourself to blame when you make bad decisions and suffer the consequences. I just feel bad for your kid.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Its stupid but 18 year olds never listen to advice that is good for them because they all think they know everything.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	I know you two love each other, which is why there's no rush to get married. Get done school, save some money, have the wedding of your dreams and get a nice house. If you do it all now, you'll be jaded by the time you're older and who knows? Maybe your tastes will have changed and he won't be the right guy for you. You're too young to make such a permanent decision and he's trying to pressure you. Tell him you want to wait, and that if he really loves you, he'll respect your decision.|`|h7xh61TWaa	Preventing a baby? Is that not what you are already trying to do?    Seriously, just because you use birth control vs "abstinence" is the same thing, preventing children. Abortion is getting rid of children. Just had to say that.    If you plan on getting married, sooner is better than later. Plans change and people change, you are in love. Get married before school. If you are waiting to have sex till you are married, good for you, no wonder he is wanting to ASAP.     Sooner is better than later! Later may never come!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	go by what you feel. if you feel you should wait, wait. you are young and there is plenty of time to get married. get your schooling out of the way and your career started if that's what your plan is. why is he in such a hurry.i got married when i was 21 the first time, and that was too early. sure the being together every night part was great, but there are other issues. financial, family, friends. if he truly loves you he will listen to what your concerns are and listen to them.  if you two were meant to be together, another couple of years is worth the wait.|`|f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	When you write that you are "well off," I presume you mean your parents are well off?  I don't suppose you and your boyfriend both have lucrative careers at 17?  Unless you expect your parents to support you and your children after your divorce, I would advise against marrying at 18.  You talk about finishing school, but it sounds like you mean finishing HIGH SCHOOL.  To me, finishing school means graduating from college, not high school.    I think you should go to college (it sounds like your parents can afford to pay for it), get your degree, begin your career, and then consider marriage (your boyfriend should do the same thing, by the way).  If you're still together when you both graduate from college, then you can consider marrying if you want to.    Finally, I think your views on birth control could set you up for disaster.  There is nothing wrong with having sex for pleasure and using modern means of preventing pregnancy.  Don't live your life as if you are living in the Middle Ages.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	WAAAAY too young!|`|ddP3klT3aa	You need to get married when you are ready. Tell him if he loves you he can wait. If he can't wait, he is not worth it. You should finish college first. It is a good idea. Don't believe in birth control? You better start of you will throw your education away. Whats the point in going to college if you are going to end up a stay at home mom with 10 kids? I wouldn't waste my time..no offense. Birth control won't hurt you.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	I got married at 18 and if I could go back, I would definitely wait and more than likely I would have married someone else.  You're only 18, there is so much to do before you settle down.  Enjoy your youth.|`|s30Duwdraa	Too young!    Finish school, live on your own, find a good job and if you're still together, then get married.  You know first hand how bad relationships can get.  Please don't make the same mistake.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Wait until atleast 19.  Dont make a mistake 18 is way to young|`|1NO10YfPaa	18 is way too young.  And you should not have sex until you are ready, and able to deal with the consequences; but, I beg you to reconsider your position on birth control, not abortion, birth control or else you might as well kiss anything other than being a baby machine goodbye.|`|nQLtGEEgaa	Honey, I dont think u should get married right away.. If he loves u, HE WILL WAIT on u!! I dont understand why he would want ta get married tha day u turn 18? Is he tryin to trap u into something, is he super jealous and wants u to himself.. I understand if he luvs u that much and jus wants ta b able to b wit or around u 24/7, but u need ta know wat u want and how he is.. U never never never truely know a person or their personality til u move in wit them.. I'm engaged, livin wit my fiancee about a year now.. I'm startin to second guess it, jus bc u have to understand work, life, stress, bills transform people into completely different beings.. He's startin this trend of drunk week nights and verbal abuse, temper temper temper.. We're tryin to work on it, but that proves that u dont truely know someone til u live wit them.. Jus take ur time and make sure this is wat u want, like u said divorce is an ugly way to end, make sure of wat u want before u get trapped into it.. Plus ur only 18, u still have college, career choice, everything ahead of u.. Marriage can wait, and if he doesnt respect ur choice, he doesnt honestly want u.. Good luck darlin!|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	The person you are at 18 is going to be a different person in 5 years let alone 10 years and the same goes for him it's better to give it some time and see what happens if you love each other that much you still will in a few years so what's the rush|`|qfsVYQMraa	I think it's great. If you love each other, and know you will spend your lives together - then why wait?      People go on about divorce.. but if it happens.. it happens. Many people get divorced.     Go for it :)    Congratulations :)|`|Syn2MwSHaa	stick to your guns dont get married yet must enjoy life and have fun first i seen to many get married early and it failed i waited until i was 27 and still married 18 yrs later mildred is my leader|`|AA12361841	If he loves you, he will wait. 18 is way too young. you must grow together and if this doesnt happen, you may grow apart and end up divorced. Have either of you experienced other relationships? I say wait until at least 22.*|`|EZj3osViaa	honestly, have you had sex, i have a feeling the reason you want to get married is to have sex.|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	if he really loves you he will understand that  but i think getting married at 18 if you are really truely in love its fine  I don't think you would end up dragging kids into everything, you can make choices that aren't the same as your parents  its really up to you though, if he is mad at you for saying no it isnt worth it|`|ceJ3O14Yaa	Don't do it  If he really loves you he will wait for you to be ready and birth control is good for not getting pregnant it is not like abortion..   you are still very young and have lots of changing to do if he loves you he will wait!!!|`|wlupqLrBaa	For you to be asking means you know your not ready. Thinking back to when I was 18, I thank God I didn't end up pregnant other wise I would still have to see him now lol! I'm only 27 but you learn alot in those years. It does work for some people but I prefer to try before I buy, live together, that's a big step at 18. See how much you get on in that situation first.    Hope this helps x|`|ed3eK4mHaa	Marriage at 18    Divorced with kids by 25.    Promise.|`|dtHjJah5aa	18 is too young.  Tell him that you want to wait because you NEVER want to get divorced and people change after high school.  Tell him you want you both to grow stronger together before you marry him.  Tell him that you are not ready for marriage yet.  You love him and want to marry him, just not right now.  I hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|EEzeeGhLaa	Tell him you dont want to rush into things. If he loves you, he will wait. If you love him, you want things to go the right way. Make sure this is going to work out. You both have to be ready, and if he's going to push you into something you aren't ready for, then maybe he isn't the right one for you. And about the pregnancy, take a fertility test, and make sure you know when you're fertile and when you arent. And when you arent, its safe to have sex and not get pregnant. Which isnt any form of contraception. Its completely natural.|`|mULJMC0waa	Your best option is to wait. The boy will still love you if he is the right one. I know that you want to please him but you should not be a slave for him. Both of you should look at college first before getting married. Since you don't believe in birth control you are at a much higher rate of getting pregnant. Or you could try to just have intercourse when you know for sure you can't get pregnant. I am not an expert on this field. Consult your doctor about this. If you can at least get a degree and he can also it will put you a much better position for later. A lot of companies want to see some college on a worker resume now. If not you are left with the low paying jobs that can't move up. You also have the rest of your life with this guy. If he is willing to wait until college is done or mostly done then you guys can have a wonderful 60 + years after that. I wish you the best of luck in your decisions and hope you two have a great life.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	There are many older people who got married at a very young age and are still happily married.  But, our society is different than what it was then.  Many things have changed.  Plus, not everyone who married young is still together.  (My parents who were 21 and married 35 years got divorced.)  Honestly, everyone is different, but 18 is awfully young for such a big (hopefully life-long) decision.  We generally can live quite a bit longer than we did before, so this is something that is bigger than it was "back in the day" so to speak.  The only one who can really say if you're ready for marriage is you.  Reading your question, I'd have to say that you don't think you're ready.  When I was 18, I thought I might be ready, but looking back now, I wasn't and it's a really good thing I didn't.  Getting married only because your boyfriend wants to isn't a good idea.  I've known a few people who have done this and are now divorced.  Maybe you two can find another alternative?  You can be committed to each other without actually being married.  If you plan to be together for the rest of your lives, what is the rush?  Perhaps for him it's about sex since you mentioned it and talked a bit about it?  For sex is another bad reason to get married, especially if you still don't want to have it due to not wanting to get pregnant and being against birth control.  Good luck.|`|AA10869003	i think your right to put so much thought in all things that can involve the rest of your life...i usually post playful,fun, teasing type answers, put i just cant do that with this question...your not asking i stupid question, i'm just not smart enough to give you a good answer, other than to tell you that thinking all such life attering choices should be taken just that seriously,and then wish you luck...i think you already know the answer but your lookin for reassurance,dont worry about it, have faith in yourself, i dont know you from adam, and i already have faith in you|`|g37eLIxgaa	I have seen both sides of this.  Some work out and some don't.      I think you just need to do what you believe in.  It is your life and you need to live it the way you want.  If he really does love you and want to be with you, he will be there when you are ready to get married.  You are 18 both you and your boyfriend will be going through a lot of  changes in your life, so don't jump into anything that you don't want to do.    *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|VmQBhY6iaa	I think NO!! Don't get marry,it's too soon,you may be happy 4ever with him,you may not,things changes,and things go wrong,I suggest you to convince him to wait,go to college,both of you finish college,then plan a wedding.  Tell him that if you guys wait until you both are more financially available he'll be giving you wedding of your dreams...18 is too soon!  About birth control,is depends of the person,not all womans handle it the same,when I got pregnant of my second I was taking birth control pills,and still got pregnant,so is depends,and well now I don't use any,but condoms(for when I'm ovulating) and I'm marry...  You sound like a smart girl,and getting marry at 18 is not smart,and you know it...hopefully he'll realizes it too...    Good luck!!|`|6AIRllZfaa	The younger you marry, the less apt it is to work out. If you love each other, then spend a couple more years together before you get married. You're planning on spending the rest of your lives together anyways, what's the problem with spending a couple more with being married?|`|8fd15b64214f2ed938ae8aea46720501aa	I did it - it worked for awhile.  I am now 33 and still married to the man.  I would not recommend it nor will I want this for our children.  I loved him very much then, but we grew apart and our views were different then each other.  In some ways we grew together, like siblings or something.  But we dont have that meaningful respect and love that people get from experiencing other relationships.  It takes a few men I think to know that what you have is good or not.  Unless you really truly know that he is the one.  I thought he was, but I also thought the idea of getting married was cool and no one was willing to sit us down and talk us out of it.  Everyone was supportive actually.|`|BJMleaXZaa	I got married at 17 and it was the biggest mistake i had ever made, i dropped out of school and didn't have a job. and i got pregnant right away. i love my son with all my heart and soul but i was only 17 and i really believed love Concord all. i didn't know any better.  i ask my self everyday "WHAT IF" what if i waited? what if i was older? what if i stayed in school? don't make that same mistake.....if your boyfriend  truly loves you he will waite for you.... There is a lot more that goes into a marriage then just love!
AuKKjaxaaa	Having been in his situation, I cannot in good conscience offer you advice in this situation.|`|izbAdDUraa	UGH i feel your pain sister. unfortunately i have not been able to break him of it short of YELLING AT HIM CONSTANTLY. When you i am not horny or something touching my boobs ticks me off.   leave em alone sheesh.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I had a b/f that continuously poked, prodded, flicked me. Couldn't take it in the end and had to get rid. Ended up hating him for it. You need to tell him again seriously how much this is ruining things for you.|`|74d22a359a13b539bf60f128a3450a53aa	Wow, SO Annoying. I have no idea how you kept yourself from killing him. This coming from a woman who has breastfed for the past 11 months & wants her boobs back!   Anywho, next time he does it, grab his hand firmly & say "I do not like it when you do that. Please stop.". Then hold his hand, kiss it & go back to what you were doing.   You just may have to treat him like a child if he is going to act like one...|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	its his mother fault..he was breast fed and loves boobs..and apparently you have nice ladies as you put it..everytime he does that kick him in the balls ,,maybe he will get the point..and respect your space|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	Seriously explain to him for the last time & if he doesn't listen leave him. Coz i'm sure you aren't happy with that.|`|5oUyPxuuaa	tell him again and if he insists on doing it then refuse sex.
5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	I hated being bullied by a terrible group of upperclassmen when I was a freshman. I was so vulnerable already, because at 14 you couldn't feel more out-of-place and ugly and awkward...and so to have a group of mean people who for some reason decided I was someone they wanted to throw things at, shove in the hallways, call names...they made me become more introverted and even more insecure-some of the repercussions of which I am still socially aware of. What makes people think they have a right to treat other people like that? I hated high school because of them.     The one thing I liked about high school though, was discovering I am an artist-I had a wonderful teacher who encouraged me to pursue it and allowed me to explore that side of myself. Within the walls of the schoolday, it reminded me of the significance I had. I was fortunate to have a family who loved me and made me feel special and important, because high school is a terrible place, and I was so glad to finally be done with adolescence.|`|7iEk06aDaa	I hated how High School is separated into these stupid categories of clicks that make a poor girl feel like a nobody. I hated having red hair and acne and not understanding math like everyone else. I hated the popular,  pretty girls that looked at you like you were a piece of garbage that some one dumped off at school. The only thing I loved at school was gym class because I was stronger and faster and could play any sport better then all the popular girls there. Dodgeball was the only time I could get even with them and get away with it. (Except when I caught a snake and put in my bookbag to let loose when the cheerleaders were eating lunch). So there you have it...|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Hated everything... loved graduating and never setting foot in the **** hole again =p|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Hated - most people at my school were stuck up. I went to a school that was very competitive and everyone at my school was smart. I hated that everyone was trying to be a doctor or a lawyer and I wasnt the smartest so some of the teachers didnt like me.    Liked - I had some great friends that i still see. I liked hanging out with them on the weekends and my best friend came to my high school when i was 16 and i'm so glad i met her.|`|0udjgaoBaa	i graduated in 99'....I lived in omaha ne..The high schools there were awesome I was popular and smart I had no complaints....However I moved to florida in 11th grade and I hated everything about the schools here the teachers could care less about you and everyone had clicks and wouldn't accept new comers...So I had no friends and skipped school alot I met my sons father and got pregnant my senior year, but because the school could care less about the students they let me graduate anyway even though I was NEVER at school.|`|r7qsCMqMaa	I couldn't stand geometry and trigonometry. I thought both were pointless subjects and that turned out to be true: I don't use any of them in my profession or in life. I liked science more thna math.|`|aFaSMYPFaa	hahaha....

I went to a small school in Oklahoma and I hated the "clicks".  We were all friends growing up and then high school came which separated all of us.|`|kfHNOtCeaa	I hated the snotty stuck up boys and girls even though we were all cool. I hated going at all. I hated the complicated teacher. I hated how the teachers treated the athletic students different than the rest.|`|BOZfqfFtaa	I HATED THE STUPID PEOPLE WHO HATED ON YOU FOR THE WRONG REASON SUCH AS NON NAMED BRANDED SHOES, NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET THOSE EVERY TWO WEEK HAIR DO'S, BEING A LIL MORE SMARTER THAN THEY, AND BEING JUST ALOT MORE POPULAR WITH HAVING NONE OF THE ABOVE.    NOW THE BOYS ARE NOT EXCLUDED THEY STEROTYPED THE SAME WAY BUT REALLY WANTED TO HOLLA BUT COULDNT DO IT IN FRONT OF THE POPULAR GIRLS SO THEY'LL DO IT AT P.E. IN THE EMPTY HALL BY THE LOCKERS OR IN AN MESSAGE TO MEET THEM ON SUCH HALLWAYTO GET GROPED WHEN WE DON'T WANT BEHIND THE SCENES LOVE BUT PUBLIC.                  YEAH HIGH SCHOOL SUCKED 4 ME|`|033ab142b8675a13094038766e095e81aa	THE ONE THING I HATED ABOUT HIGHSCHOOL WAS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE JUDGED EVERYONE.  IT DIDNT MATTER HOW THEY LOOKED BUT THEY WOULD FIND SOMEONE TO TEASE THEM ABOUT.  AND IF YOU WERE OVERWEIGHT IT WAS EVEN WORSE.  KIDS CAN BE SO CRUEL.  YEARS LATER WHEN YOU RUN INTO THOSE PEOPLE THEY DONT REMEMBER MAKING FUN OF YOU AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY EXCEPT HOW ARE YA...AND THEY GO ON  I THINK THEY EAT THEIR WORDS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY SEE THAT YOU DID BETTER THEN THEM IN LIFE THEY STOP TO THINK WHY THEY TEASED YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
c1bdaa935ac8a493db25fc52bf1f22c4aa	I think she's not really over you... Sometime to take a step back, in your case 3 years, you seem to be able to remember the good times and she miss them...

You would spin it around and, if you were a guy, kiss the first girl it pointed to (vice versa for girls).    Like every other "brave" act, it gets easier with practice and the first time always feels awkward.    Fear of rejection is always a factor.  To improve your opportunities for success, kiss her forehead first, her face second and her mouth only after you get a clear indication that kissing you is something she  wants to do.      Watch for "body language" and if she is ducking her head to avoid you, back off immediately.    If she's not ready to kiss you right now, don't automatically assume it's because she doesn't like you.  Females, particularly in "conservative" circles, are subjected to a "double standard" in which guys can get away with anything but girls are accused of being "bad" the first time they even look at a guy the wrong way.    And don't kiss anyone you don't have feelings for -- that's what's meant by  a "stolen" kiss.    Finally, remember that, when it comes to  kissing,  there are three kinds of guys: (1) Those who kiss and  tell; (2) Those who kiss and don't tell; and (3) Those who don't kiss but still tell everyone they did.    Best wishes.|`|yrVti01Uaa	everything went as planned. lol|`|ZCN5rGkWaa	1st planing isnt a very good idea when it comes to kissing just let it flow , follow the mood and everything will happen how its suppose too without planing dont worry about it and relax and be urself . kristal_2020@yahoo.com for mor personal questions if u want .|`|yDsKOeVKaa	it wasnt that hard.. i just kinda went with the flow of things|`|otYvv2XOaa	drunk.. but the first time i really did, it was perfect... you have to feel the love you have for the person then no matter how bad you mess up it will still be passionate...|`|xbTIbP97aa	I think girls need the guy to make the first move always!

We were in a long distance relationship because I was going to school. He had no job, wasn't in school. Yet refused to come see me and said he wouldn't quote: "Inconvenience himself just so I could see him on Valentine's Day."    Oh and the kicker was that he also told me that he had promised another girl he'd spend Valentine's Day with HER b/c she had just gotten dumped by her boyfriend and he wanted to "cheer her up."    Oh wait, I'm sorry.. did you say what was the most ROMANTIC thing? Sorry mis-read.    I'm just jaded.

Lying will only get you into BIG trouble. My brother was taking care of his GFs gerbil (well, not really taking care of it), and it died. He told her what happened, and she said it was OK. He wounded up buying her a new one. I guess it just depends on what kind of pet it is. If it was a dog or a cat, then good luck!|`|nYEwK5FNaa	Depends how it died. Buy the same pet that looks exactly the same. She will never know I've done it before.|`|JHYwzWSbaa	RUN NOW!! WHILE YOU CAN!    no, i'm joking ofcourse :)    just tell the truth, honesty is the best thing inside of someone!    i'm sure you'd want an honest partner, so you'd have to return the honesty    aslong as they know you are sorry, i;m sure they would get over it after time being!|`|AA11886887	Cover that up!

Hamster or other small critter? Just say it died on the spot, they tend to do that.    Rabbit? Throw it at a neighborhood dog, and hope it will tear it up. Then blame the dog.    Cat? Just put it in the bottom of the dumpster, and help your friend hang pictures throughout the neighborhood to try and get the "walked away" cat back.    Turtle? Just leave it in its cage, it could take months before he or she sees/smells the difference.    Horse? Take of the skin, and make a really nice handbag with matching shoes out if it. This will compensate for the pain of loss.|`|5f449c637a79c3dd213f6d4bcfef22a0aa	what do you mean "for some reason" it died? How did it die? Did you kill it? What kind of pet was it?

Its not like YOU killed it. If it just kicked the bucket, its not your fault, it was the critter's time. If you cover it up, it will make you look really bad.

f6a177061a935df6ab959c2ecb265589aa	Aren't you glad you aren't married to this stalker anymore? My first suggestion is that you log all these contacts - he really is acting like a cyber-stalker, and you might need to contact the police about it someday.    But I'd suggest that you try this first:  Send him one more message: "I will not respond to any more of your personal comments." Then don't. With luck, the lack of response will discourage him. (But if he accelerates, talk to a lawyer ASAP)    He's still trying to stay attached to you and control you, don't let him.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	What a psycho!  Get a restraining order ASAP.  He is stalking you and is incredibly obsessed with you.  I had an ex-boyfriend that was like that and he even broke the rules of the restraining order.

NO ONE. Make your number private in the phone books. You can even block his number on your phone. There are ways around this. Or just kill him and bury him some where...put him in acid.|`|S9UKQKG0aa	I would create a new account.  Unless he has your e-mail password there is no way for him to know who you are.  And if he does, then you need a new e-mail too.  The first thing I did when I got divorced was change all of my passwords to something that he wouldn't figure out.  I would change your IM name too.  If he can't find you then he can't talk to you.

Did you know anybody when you made that move? It's always a tough decision to make a move away from all your friends, but you know what? If there true friends they will find a way to stay in touch and its not like you don't know anybody where your going. So basically you have one foot in the pot so to speak.

zaSyEcnqaa	What you have picked is fine. The stones are very similiar. I wonder what the price difference? Perhaps an inclusion is very visible on the less-priced one? Can you examine these in person? They probably have different facets or something.     The.75 is a great size. If you desire later on , you can always "upgrade" the centerstone.     It is ridiculous how expensive diamonds get after the 1 carat mark. I looked at a 2 carat that was $20,000!      I have heard you get good deals staying just under 1 carat. It is better to get a smaller stone that is high quality and sparkles and shines versus a big dead, yellow diamond. I would take a small sparkler any day over a big dud.     Just do not spend what you cannot afford. It is not worth it in the long run to be stressed over money for a ring.|`|kc68BXwTaa	I'd say get the smaller one. No one worth being with will accept or deny a marriage proposal based on the engagement ring.    Weddings can also be crazy expensive, so it may not be feasible to upgrade the carat size before the wedding, but you could do it on the 5th anniversary (or the 10th, whatever).    And usually the original stone in the ring isn't traded in. It's usually made into a necklace or something for the girl to have (for sentimental reasons).|`|8vTyYomzaa	Buy what you can afford without having to finance it and don't listen to the jewelry sales people who try to talk you into something more than you can afford.     Some women want a bigger diamond just to show off to their friends, an intelligent woman would rather have a great husband to show off to her friends!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I think she would love any ring you give her...some ppl say the bigger the better but i think the quality of the ring is the best thing to invest your money on..  i think .75 ct would Look good, also depending on her finger size I have small hands and I know anything over .8 ct would make my hand look really small and funny..    I say go for something medium and get the best quality...and give her the option to upgrade and your annyversaty...but im sure she'll love it.    good luck|`|TUNvbXbgaa	my diamond engagement ring is only 1/4th of a carrot with 4 small diamonds on each side of it. I love my ring . he bought what he could afford. I will never upgrade.  i prefer small diamonds. if she loves you she will love what you buy her and never upgrade. Upgrading my ring wont have the same meaning to it.   he gave me my small diamond with so much love.|`|JXw0U77aaa	If she has small hands, anything larger than 1 ct is going to look ridiculous.  Yes, you CAN buy a smaller diamond at first and then upgrade later, but I personally think that's ridiculous.  When you upgrade, it's no longer the ring you proposed with, and it's meaningless.  If you're going to get a bigger diamond later on, just get her one and call it a right hand ring - because it's certainly not an engagement ring anymore, as it's not what you gave her to get engaged.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	a 2 ct diamond is going to cost you several thousand, not even counting a setting to put it in!  I mean if you're getting a big stone you can't scrimp on the quality and color.  are you sure your girl even wants a stone that big?  personally I would find myself knocking it into all kinds of things, I don't want that much $$$ riding on my finger.  put your ego aside and be sure you're getting something she will love.  there's nothing not respectable about a diamond less than a carat.  and yes, if you get her a smaller one now she can have it re-set in another setting with more diamonds down the road for your anniversary or something.  but in order to make sure it matches up with other diamonds later, you have to get good color and quality now.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I would much rather my fiance buy me a ring that he can afford then for him to go in debt buying me a big stone.  My ring is small but that's what he could afford.  It's where we're at financially in our lives.  In 20 years if he can afford a 10 carat diamond and wants to buy it for me, then fine.  But for now, all that matters is that I have him.  I'm sure your fiance will be estatic about whatever you give her.  COngrats!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	It is common for a man to trade it in but not before the wedding.  Usually diamonds are traded in around the 5-8 year mark.  However most brides would love .74 or .78.  That's very close to a carat and not "small" at all.    Personally if my groom had bought that I don't know if I would ever want to trade it in.  Mine is 1.2 carat but the ones I liked ranged from .75-1.2.  The one he liked happened to be the biggest so I understand what you mean on the macho thing.    Weddings are expensive so I doubt you'll trade it in before the wedding and I doubt she'd want you to.  The ring you proposed with has sentimental attachment.  The price goes up a lot at what is "1 carat" (which actually starts at like .92 carat not 1.0 like you should expect).    Pick out a setting that you love.  Settings can be very expensive.  So can the wedding band.  Then if in 5 years she wants a bigger stone, you can look into upgrading then.  Both of those are beautiful stones though.  Read the lab report.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Just save up for something you can afford and give it to her when you can. It used to be that was how it was done all the time. The ring was not determined whether you were married or in love with someone. No it isn't common to buy a smaller ring first and then upgrade although people will tell you that it is.|`|76nTvO4iaa	3/4 carat is a nice sized stone.    I know a lot of women who got that size and were very happy with it.  Many didn't upgrade until their 20th or later anniversary because they had children and the money wasn't there.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I agree with answerer Sweet Di on this one. I love the rings my husband chose for me - they are modest, but totally beautiful. I have small hands - yes, about half the size of his, so I know what it's like.   I disagree with 'trading up' rings - it's very special to have and keep the rings given for the engagement and wedding. If at some point in the future you want to give her more bling, get her a lovely ring for the 10th anniversary!  Truly, only buy what you can afford.   Unfortunately platinum ups your cost a LOT, compared to white gold.  Platinum rings are often sold without the center stone, so be careful when you are looking.  Just as an example, this ring in gold would probably be around 400, but this price is so much higher in platinum  http://www.jamesallen.com/Engagement/Thr...    But shop around, see what suits your budget. Some ideas -    WOW, this is a great deal for a nice sized stone   http://www.fredmeyerjewelers.com/Product...    http://www.zales.com/product/index.jsp?p...|`|HCgNSgKBaa	both are beautiful, and you shouldn't have to get a bigger one. If you feel the need to buy a bigger one. Those are both beautiful. it is the quality and those are quality diamonds. If you really feel the need buy her a bigger diamond for like your 5th or 10th anniversary. Most women would like to keep the ring they got married with so wouldn't want to trade up. I guess it depends on the girl!|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Do you know what she wants?  To me, 1.5 or 2ct would be WAY too big.  When my husband and I were talking about getting engaged, I actually told him even 1ct was pushing it.      I do have a 1ct ring and it is absolutely perfect sized.  I get compliments on it all the time.  And with the wedding band wrap, i have to 1/5 ct diamonds (one on each side of the solitare) so it is actually very decent sized and very "blingy".    Remember, you can always add to the ring over the years with more diamonds and whatnot.  I think the size you are going with is a great size and the quality of the first one was very good.  Always go for high quality versus high quantity.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Buying a smaller diamond ring at first is absolutely fine, and honestly, I think the diamonds in those rings look plenty big.  Instead of upgrading the stone before the wedding, how about buying her a wedding band with more diamonds in it, so when she wears them together it's very sparkly and beautiful.
rEafx4QTaa	definitely clear it past your boss first be careful with this tho there are some things u have to consider    how close are u with ur boss (sounds like ur pretty close)  would they aoprove of u dating their daughter  is this a job that u plan on being at for a while and if so, if things dont workout between u too how would ur boss react    jus some things to think about, good luck|`|RvFwmQOPaa	You say that you are pretty good with your supervisor so to keep it that way, I think you should go to your supervisor and tell her that you really like her daughter and that you would like to ask her out. I would also stress to her that you are coming to her first because you don't want it to be a problem in the workplace and you wanted her opinion. If she thinks that it would be a bad idea then I would back off but if she gives you her blessing then go for it.|`|0oiAQ4jvaa	Dont spoil the friendship wirh your boss.

When your older nobody expects you to be shy they expect you to be a man not a boy.    What to do? i dont know i never cracked it. All people will tell you is to suck it up and just go for it, impossible i know.    Dont go down the dark road of depression what ever you do though. This will lead to other things like social anxiety and destroy your confidence and self esteem. Obviously this will make your shyness worse not better.|`|S4VVE0onaa	the best advice i can come up with is to hang out more with people that are confident it tends to rub off. also go to self help sites.   shyness is hard to overcome and it takes him to work on, just keep telling yourself that you are equal to everyone else no less than anyone.    hope it works out for you!    ps if you really like this girl but can't go up to her maybe write her a note or something. might not sound the best to you but a girl will love it!
8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	You handled this properly and politely. Kudos to you. It's a shame she doesn't value your friendship. I think it's time to let her go.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Is it possible for you to talk to her husband directly? Maybe he'll have more sense than her. What you did was good - keeping your cool and all. I don't understand why a polite request (with a sensible reason) would be turned down.|`|AA10027242	That's screwed up.  I always thought the people who sent the mass text messages were the teenager-like people.   You may just have to change your number, because knowing people like that, I have a feeling you're about to get a lot of text messages.|`|TBPb9Tkfaa	what you did was totally not rude at all. she is probably just embarassed or something because its her husband, but its not a big deal.  i get them all the time and they are super annoying,  somehow try and avoid them|`|AA11303632	There is no big deal!  You went about it the right and civil way.  I hate it when I get those kind of text's or emails as well.  What you should do is sign your friend and her husband up for all kinds of credit card or free stuff online by using their number and tell them you did.  And when she asks for you to take their number off or why you did it....answer "what's the big deal? It's only a phone call?" lol|`|clRBcaacaa	He is the one being childish if he is sending stupid **** like that. I hate those to.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Stand your ground your in the right here.|`|NTUr0t3haa	First - her husband is an idiot and very rude for sending these texts to masses of people. He may also be unstable.    Second - asking a spouse to tell their wife/husband to stop doing something is never a good idea. You have to ask the husband directly. Especially since she's emotionally unstable. It was in her mind a direct, aggressive attack on her husband. To a normal person, maybe it's not a "big deal". To her, it was a serious attack on her and on her husband.    (Also, she became instantly ashamed when you mentioned it and this caused her to become enraged. Shame and rage are closely related.)    Three - I don't think the husband is going to remove your number unless another man (your husband) asks him to. If you don't have a husband, a boyfriend or some guy with a deep voice will do. He will only do it if intimidated.|`|Rq2tMCQdaa	hmmmm, i really don't know. I guess when he sends you a fwd just don't read it and delete it. that's what i do.
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	See my answer to the last time you asked this question...|`|sr0vZPQqaa	What?
qHEpR92Gaa	Happy Valentines Day from the love of you.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	With you it's Valentine's Day 365 a year!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	write what your feelings are, not what we THINK your feelings are and he will get the best card ever.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Just a card for my favorite Valentine  You make me smile   Wanna play with me for a while?|`|BUvPi5ldaa	Roses are red  Violets are blue  I really like you  I hope you like me too.    Cheesy but i'd like it =)
abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Pretty good looking... need some design elevation and navigational ease.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	For all issue's ??? pregnancy, marriage, cooking or is it for something specific
NJVm6dTiaa	Oh yes, I'd be bothered alright, I'd be absolutely livid.   It is not a "right" as your boyfriend put it, to spy upon you ... it is a creepy violation of privacy. I would be deeply concerned about that, and wonder what else he feels it's his "right" to check up on. There has to be trust in a relationship, and I really don't think I'd be terribly comfortable in a relationship with a man who didn't trust me. It's insulting, and to be checked up on is creepy.   If your boyfriend was feeling paranoid some time ago, then he should have communicated those insecurities to you, and given you the opportunity to address them openly. But to go behind your back and spy on you, especially when you had given him no cause for concern,  was disgusting. It's very kind of you to forgive him this time and be over it already .. you're stronger than I would be in that situation. I hope you've made it clear though that you regard it as totally unacceptable and it must never happen again.|`|4GmeIopoaa	You need to tell him to stay out of your buisness and delete that program. Man that would piss me off.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	If your husband, er your shack-up hunky wants to know what you're doing - so be it.  People in a life-commitment to each other (i.e. marriage!  don't play married!) shouldn't have secrets and should be willing to share anything.    That said, you need trust in a relationship.  So I understand being bothered by having someone install something like that without telling you.  What you need to ask him is this:  "Honey, I want to make sure we have a strong, trusting relationship built on love.  I want to build a relationship on trust, where you can ask me anything, and I am willing to do anything to show you can trust me, including letting you put a keylogger on my computer.  Can you help me understand why you wouldn't just talk to me about putting a keylogger on my computer, instead of doing it behind my back?"  Don't let him hem-and-haw about it.  Either he doesn't trust you and you need to get to the bottom of why (it will end your relationship if you can't solve that), or he's trying to get information from you (bank? who knows?).  This should be a red flag that you have some work to do.|`|qAMZ9Jozaa	Bothered?  It might happen once, a second time would be grounds for divorce as far as I am concerned.|`|E9r7jOSZaa	Its strange being a guy who doesn't know u as much, I feel awful about the incident. I don't think he suspects you, he is just careful coz he knows net is a scary place and you can bump into all kinds of strange characters online. I guess that's the only reason he did that. If I were in your place I'd take things calmly and not make an issue out of it. We are humans and we all make mistakes and if it involves our loved ones we should be more careful to short out matters amicably.I'd suggest you to be nice and gentle with him and address any insecurity he might have in your relationship. You both need to re-assure each other about your commitment level and bring back trust. Don't have any bitterness about the incident coz that might haunt you later. Always remember 'to err is human & to forgive is divine'      God Bless !!|`|RcAofGkIaa	Danger, danger!  Someone who is your significant other thinks it's OK to spy on you?  And you're willing to accept that?  Your relationship is not based on trust and mutual respect.  That means it is not a good relationship at all.  If you intend to continue this relationship you need professional guidance.  I am dead serious.  This is a huge warning label, be sure to read it.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Sorry, but he messed up big time.  Its up to you, but for more reasons than I care to go into, you should leave this one behind.    If you stay with him, you are accepting his behavior.  This isn't a minor thing, either.  He doesn't trust you and he's betrayed your trust, so you shouldn't trust him.  Without trust, there is no relationship.|`|f6YsGOynaa	If he's paranoid for no reason that's apparent to you, or that he's willing to state, it may be due to a guilty conscience.|`|izbAdDUraa	PSYCHO.  ugh what a creeper.  remove it and him from your life.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	I'd be a little concerned that he considers it a "right" to spy on you.    Even people who aren't up to anything bad have a legitimate reason to want privacy. Maybe the person you're talking to wouldn't bring up certain subjects in front of him.  Eg. Somebody who's known me 15 years and has only met my husband a couple times might be comfortable talking about their personal problems with me, but not with him.  Even if he is only spying on my half, he'd get the gist. Maybe you're planning a surprise for him and he'd spoil it by looking at your key log.  Maybe you're a little uncomfortable with something he did and want a sounding board to talk about it and try to decide whether to be upset or let it go.      I think when somebody starts thinking they need to secretly spy on their partner, it's a bad sign.  It's not necessarily an indication that someone is a bad person, but a sign of a relationship that is not as healthy as it could be.|`|b26NgqOFaa	Ya know, I wouldn't.  I don't have anything to hide.|`|j7l9gavRaa	why was he feeling paranoid?  if he honestly never checked it then let it go but talk to him to find out what made him do that|`|mzkfSwLwaa	It's no crime to do that? Relax just take it off duh    Thanks for easy 2 points|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	If he had told you, that would be one thing. But to go behind your back and put it on is another. I would definitely sit down with him and tell him that if he wants to know something to ask you. If he's normally not a jealous type, then I would wonder what triggered this response for him.|`|81wvN8Rraa	It depends: Do you live together? Is it a shared laptop or just yours?    If you don't live together and it's just yours then I would be upset. But if you do live together he should have talked to you about it.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	Yes! sooo bothered!! I will be pist! I'm not a crazy-psycho bit*h neither...  but i think thats disrespectful because he's like hiding...no?|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	well he should have been honest about the insecurity but if yo uhave nothing to hide then let it slide|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I'd be more than upset.    I would break up with him pretty much instantly.   That's just me though. I guess if you can deal with it, then just let it go.    But I wouldn't be able too.    I don't believe in the whole "nothing to hide" thing.  People should have privacy, and have a right to expect that from a significant other.    People might not feel like they need to hide things, if other people weren't snooping.
OG4410bdaa	I really want to try this sometime  can't ever seem to get around to it what with my husband's work and my school, and our son....but as soon as we have a night off from all three, I'm looking forward to doing this (I've only talked to my husband once about it but he seemed up for it)|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	never played that game. we did go to a bar for new years though and when i went to the bar and ordered drinks i would get hit on everytime as my hubby watched from the table. he thought it was funny and i liekd the attention so we went hoem and made sweet sweet fireworks|`|Syn2MwSHaa	never played this game mildred is my leader|`|AWb0L9IKaa	Thou it's a bit on the weird side, my husband tried to pimp me saying he is my senior brother. it was fun but we wouldn't do it again.
hY6zcQozaa	It could be that he realized he didn't want a serious relationship with you, but likes u enough as a friend, and would like to continue that friendship. But since his new relationship is a long distance one, he may just be wanting you there for him as a backup.  Now you'll have to find out which one it is, or just keep doing what u have been doing, which is moving on with your life|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	he wants to have his cake and eat it too! His gf doesnt live near him so he has you on the side to flirt with and make him feel better about himself. He's a jerk and he obviously doesnt care about how you feel. Ditch him and find a good guy.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	your his girl when she not around .. sorry.. but its true ..|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	He wants to hang out with you because his girlfriend is in another country. Even though he doesn't want sex, he's still kind of using you. Don't you think?|`|46StihsPaa	He really wants to be your friend. He really does like you obviously, like a sister kind of. You should get over the girl and be friends with him.|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	he wants his cake and eat it too. first move on and forget the friend bulls--- line. he is selfish and just looking out for himself and is using you for a rebound just in case the other girl does'nt work out.or you could be considered his insurance policy as well. move on christian, or not, christian or not.|`|4wdLsy2laa	It sounds like he is trying to cover all his bases. What he did is shallow. Basically what he did is he found what he considers to be a prettier model, but he wants to keep you in the garage in case this new model doesn't work out. Or because he considers you a friend, he may be just sharing. If you are going to stay "just friends" then you need to tell him point blank that talking to you about his other relationship is completely off limits. If he can't respect that, then you should wish him the best and move on.    I would also recommend that you advise him to go to confession and talk about what he did to you. A third point of view is usually very helpful in getting a person to see things from your point of view    I hope this helps|`|bUmdkEnxaa	Do   not worry ,we are all with you ,you are not single now.My classmates were like him .|`|Ls1oc5syaa	i think that he is really trying to make you jealous because he wouldnt come out of no where and tell you that...if you guys are friends then keep it to friend talk not other stuff that you would tell your guy friends|`|hVOYlQzHaa	I don't think he's trying to hurt you on purpose. I think he really wants to be friends with you. If he trusted you during the relationship, why won't he do it after you guys broke up. Trust me, my ex is dating an old friend of mine and all three of us are very cool. When he has problems with his girlfriend, he comes to me. We even go out to the movies together as friends, just me and him. Just try and see what his real purpose is. I understand if you feel a bit jealous, since I felt the same way at the begining. But don't worry, you'll get over it soon.
qxqhzLC1aa	Sometimes the men in our lives can become "boy's mentally". They say that behind every good man THERE IS A GREAT WOMAN. Be sure that you are doing what is best for you and your baby and if helping him get employment is what you have to do for your family.... Do it. Do set a time frame on the time you are willing to support and help, let them know the "guidelines they must follow for your continued support". This should have YOU at the top of the list..As for brothers mate, woman's intuition is real and is usually right,especially if you have had a long term relationship with the male you ?.Is the bro's mate friends with you? Maybe she "Should become one" if you know what I'm sayin'. F2F|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Doesn't matter who he talks to or what he does, you're not together. Cut the poor guy some slack!|`|hrFGKAeraa	He borrowed your car and then went to pick up his brother? When his brother has his own car? I don't think you're being controlling there, it's YOUR car.      Why are you helping him if you're not together? Even if he his your daughter's father, he's a grown man and should be able to help himself. I suggest you either take him back or move on. You're only causing yourself stress.
TWW5DGttaa	I don't like it actually, but maybe that's because I can't fit the words to the music. It doesn't seem very funny|`|BuqVi5IBaa	no, NO, IT SUCKS A$$ FROM A STRAW
kMevVPiYaa	You basically cant have a relationship without trust. I've seen it, and been through it. You may last if the other person trusts you, but if u dont then what is the point? Honestly its totally up to you. I had to think a bit, but when I ended it it seemed to be for the best because all my stress was gone and I didnt have to worry about anything anymore. You may feel better if you end it but if u still love them it will make it a bit harder. I personally suggest going through your options and make the best decision for you. Good Luck, hope all goes well for you.|`|BkrBNTPPaa	will not work out. always will b fighting. it may take a while if u really are in love but it is inevitable.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI BEAD ZSZ,,,,I THINK FROM EXPERIENCE THAT WEN YOU LOOSE THE TRUST O F SOMEONE,,,U CLAIM TO LOVE ITS VERY HARD TO GET YOUR RELATIONSHIP BACK TO WERE IT ONCE WAS,,,,BUT ALSO SOME GUYS N GIRLS DONT TRUST CAUSE THERE TO INSECURE,,,AND THATS CALLED JEALOUSY,,,IT  RUINS A RELATIONSHIP,,,,,PEACE|`|el8XHxBpaa	It will be really hard if there is not complete trust. it will hurt the relationship in many ways.   If you think you will never trust them again then its time to end it before it gets worse and hurts more|`|Di4CNHVnaa	You definitely can't have a long lasting relationship if one person doesn't fully trust the other. At least, I can't.  Eventually, it will start falling apart due to jealousy and suspicion.  It can last a month, maybe a bit more, but if trust isn't starting to be restored by then it will be over.      The good news is that trust can be saved with a good deal of patience and work (particularly on the part of the person who did something wrong).  It's possible, difficult, but possible if you're both trying to make it work and restore the trust.  Just don't expect it to come back overnight. It will take a few months to fully trust the other person again.|`|37ana68Haa	well it really depends on who doesnt trust who in your situation if you dont trust them then your gonna get your heart broken and it will be soon if they dont trust you then you shouldnt be doing anything to where that person cant trust you sorry about the vagueness but you had to do something you arent just untrustable for doing nothing|`|fRRTvReDaa	trust can always be regained.. its never impossible. but it depends on the person. some people are more forgiving and trust again easily, whereas there are people out there who will hold it inside them until the day they die...literally.     If there is no full trust in the relationship, it could mean many things.. a few of these could be:  the non-trusting person is...    1: an extremely insecure person..its just their character and no amount of reassurance or loyalty can convince them otherwise.    2. cheating or messing around so they are constantly insecure about their partner's loyalty because they know they get up to things themselves and assume if they can get away with it, so can their partner.    3. they have been let down many times before in the past and cant easily trust people.    4. they have been let down by the same person before, once or on many occasions, and is now having difficulties trusting that person again.    Is it you who is not trusting? If so, you have to think about the reasons behind...if its because you are an insecure person...then you can work at it. you can even seek professional help (it wont mean ur insane!) and you can work on your own insecurities, resolve them, and have a healthier relationship as a result of eliminating the main issue.    if its because youve been let down by others before, you can, again learn from your mistakes, look out for hints or signs, and determine whether or not this person deserves your trust as he/she is not the same as the ones in the past.    if this person however keeps letting you down and breaking your trust, then chances are this relationship will not go very far and how long it lasts is upto you and how long you are willing to hold on to something you know you should let go of, but is too hard to let go of.    just try to find out the reason behind the insecurities before trying to determine whether or not you trust the person. if you realise you definitely cant trust the person because theyve broken it before, then train yourself to slowly distance yourself and let go of that person if its too hard letting go instantly.       hope it helps? its a tough situation...its a very bad one. i am very insecure too in general and it causes alot of problems but im working hard to get over it because i desperately want to save my relationship.     good luck!|`|KBU2X921aa	Well lets just say i am in your situation. I stupidly cheated on my GF and i'll regret that for the rest of my life. Well after that she lost all trust for me and its been the hardest thing ever. We are friends still but its so hard because i want to be with her but she keeps telling me that she can't trust me. I personally believe though that i can be fully trusted now. But that's because i learned my lesson. I don't believe a relationship without trust can last. It's too hard to go on with your daily life if you keep thinking about what the other is doing. If you want to be happy you must be honest as well though. I added in my story to maybe get another side in. hoped this helped.|`|qh1NHD4Oaa	Trust can be saved but when it's not the relationship will fail.You can't tell how long it will take to fail.Give the person a chance and see how things go but if you still don't trust a person after a few months there's not much hope.|`|pPxEhKnaaa	Trust will start a lot of arguments!  If you have no reason not to trust him, you will ruin the relationship.  You can not have a healthy relationship without trust.  If this relationship makes you feel insecure, this may not be the mate for you.  Your mate is supposed to complete you, not tear you into pieces..........|`|dd07d44218c6f0cb9b4e55aae3015401aa	i asked myself the same question this past week when my boyfriend started telling me he doesn't trust me, i was very upset. i don't know what kind of relationship you can have with someone if your constantly worrying about whether or not they're lying to you or if they're going to cheat on you.|`|ia2kz4qyaa	i think someone can learn to trust the other person, then  the relationship can be saved|`|5agXk9ldaa	sorry to tell you a unsecure relationship will one day fail|`|SweWC8p1aa	Everyone says that without trust, there is not a relationship..  Well, i will tell you what.. My boyfriend & I will be 2 years going out on Valentines Day.. He cheated on me last year, I was heartbroken.. I still dont trust him till this day, but i think it made our relationship so much stronger.. I have a great relationship with my boyfriend, the only thing is.. I worry a lot about what he is doing and if he is lying. Thats the only down part! But trust can always be gained again, it just takes a long time. Mines taking mroe then a year... But im in love with this guy and if you are too, then you need to try to make it work! Hope i helped, good luck babe.|`|vAyvv5ngaa	a relationship with incomplete trust or no trust at all will fail sooner or later..ive seen a relationship like that..theyve been together for 6yrs..but along the way, the trust was lost coz of some incident..they tried to fix it but there are always doubts and insecurities..if there's no trust, one of you in the relationship will be controlling..one can be paranoid..just think of other negative things that you can feel if there's no trust..its better not to commit on a relationship that has no trust..|`|6dHIoJLVaa	I'm in a similar situation, I suppose the other side of it.  I just found my girlfriend out, she lied to me about a pretty big issue, to my face, holding my hand, looking me straight in the eyes.  Begging me to believe her.  And a few days later I found out she lied and she admitted it.      I think a relationship is always able to be mended, but it takes a full effort from both parties.  You each can't fix the issue on your own.  Why doesn't he trust you?  Have you done untrustworthy things?  If so you need to work on being honest and open with him, and admitting it was wrong.      However maybe it is because he is unable to trust himself, and therefore cannot trust anyone.  If that is the case it is something you both need to really talk about.  A major source of problems I've had in relationships, people don't communicate.  Secrets and deception and a lack of admission of issues is not a way to found a relationship.  You cannot be happy from that.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	..pointless|`|jH90CtQIaa	a friendship|`|a3QNUrdfaa	if there is no trust in the relationship, then there is no real relationship.    a relationship, a long one anyway, should be built on trust, respect, mutual interests and communication. Trust can be built, but its very difficult and may never truly go away. trust is essential in a long-term relationship. one without that may last for awhile, but most likely it will end, probably sooner rather than later.|`|3SWjKcAEaa	It won't last too long, I don't think. Trust is important, otherwise you will be suspicious all the time. It's not a good feeling. Why do you not trust him? There is probably a good reason, one would think. Perhaps, it's better to be casual acquaintances, for certainly I won't call it a relationship or even a friendship with no trust.|`|5r48jn7iaa	when someone doesn't trust the other its not a relationship|`|h0CtylDMaa	No. Trust is one , if not, the main thing in a relationship. Without trust, you worry. It can make you crazy, sick, and always on the edge.  It's hard to be with someone and not trust them.   So, in my opinion and experiences, no. A relationship will not last, no matter how much you love someone, no matter how much they love you, and no matter howhard you try or they try, without trust, you will never have a HAPPY, long lasting relationship.  Yes, you can have a relationship without trust, but it won't work out in the end.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	It leads to anxiety, depression, frustration, guilt, self doubt, anger, hopelessness, exhaustion, etc.|`|dvX11ttNaa	DONT GIVE UP!  How long have you been together/dating?  It takes time, you actually have to build trust, it doesn't come naturally.  It CAN last. If you've been dating for a long time, there is probably no point. If there is still no trust after a long period of time, there probably will never be. Talk to him, tell him how you feel.     Good luck!|`|fV47ExCRaa	your screwed.|`|TtsEeJZqaa	that would be an open relationship.|`|8hIUOajLaa	Without trust a relationship is nothing but an empty facade waiting to crumble.|`|e6a23ac67889f43ee25e6ff968fea607aa	Well dear Friend...wat i think is ...Love is never wanting to lose faith, never wanting to give up, and never truly moving on. Love is knowing and praying in the deepest part of what's left of your heart that they feel the same.  Love is as much of an object as an obsession, everybody wants it, everybody seeks it, but few ever achieve it, those who do will cherish it, be lost in it, and among all, never... never forget it.Pleasure of love lasts but a moment, Pain of love lasts a lifetime.  Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.    Infatuation describes the intense range of feelings present at the beginning of most relationships; sweaty palms, rapidly beating heart, butterflies in the stomach. The world is a better, more beautiful place because object of your affection is with you. Every time you touch is thrilling, you remember every conversation, and your thoughts revolve around them. In more common terms, this is a crush. Crushes are a very real, normal part of human life. Everyone experiences at least one crush at some point or another in their lives.    Relationship wat i think is to trust and understand each other with love ...Otherwise its useless...  Love is like a war:Easy to begin Hard to end!...(/:-)|`|jOOmq1qOaa	I personally don't think its as bad as people seem to think. If two people don't trust each other they can still be happy. It just takes more work to help reassure your partner of what your doing and etc. Basically just let then know what your doing all the time so there is no need for them to be upset.

However, women are the masters of any relationship.|`|xAjTXYLUaa	woman|`|c3DqvgE4aa	Physcically yes..|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Neither, if you are asking who has more power, you're view of it is skewed.  Men and women are meant to be equal partners!|`|dtHjJah5aa	Depends on who you ask.  Women hold the power of giving life because we are the ones who give birth.    Men hold the power of making more money because in reality 'it's a man's world' and the 'good ol' boy club' is still strong.    But a man can be brought down by any woman who decides she wants to bring him down....so I guess it's an individual guess on which one has the most power.  I hope this answers your question.

What really matters is the person who gave them that power and or what that person decides to do with that power is important, is what makes a person truly powerful. Knowing the source of it, and knowing that all things come from above.. from the Father in Heaven...for example a person can have much money (power) but if it is spent laveshly and on selfish things, the power dis-appears and has become foolishness..        God Bless your day !!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	All other things being equal, an average woman will crush an average man in a power struggle.  Men try to level the playing field with a number of tactics including:   1. Making a lot of money (this tactic actually works well if combined with a nice personality and good sense of humor).    2. Religion (wives be subservient to your husbands type stuff) This one doesn't work as well.  It is too abstract.  My wife is religious catholic but she completely ignores this concept :) :).      I know this is going to sound shallow but:  In most long term relationships where the man is still physically attracted to his wife, she becomes domninant over time.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Give me a break??

The divorce rate is higher in the US.  I think because there is temptation everywhere you look and people are more willing to cheat.
4wdLsy2laa	If a girl is cute, any guy will overlook most anything. The guy has most likely forgotten about it. I say if you think you would really like to get to know him, then approach him again and make some conversation. Don't come on too strong, but approach the situation as trying to be friends first and then see where it goes from there.     You shouldn't be paranoid. If you have ever seen the movie "The 40 year old virgin", you know that you just need to go for it and don't put "him" on a pedestal.    As a guy I always appreciate it when a beautiful girl talks to me even if it is just to be friends.    I hope this helps.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	It's really not a big deal.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If you were measured properly, you shouldn't have to worry about the dress fitting. The sales people should be trained how to measure and what size to order based on their measurements. If your dress doesn't fit and they ordered it in the size they recommended, it is not your fault, it is theirs and they will be ordering you a dress in the right size at no extra charge. relax until you try it on. If it doesn't fit then, that's when you raise a stink because THEY were the ones who measured you.    Good luck!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	beautiful gown, but I don't see any corset closure.   I thought that meant it laced up the back.  anyhoo, you can't expect it to fit you 'off the rack', whatever size the bridal shop ordered for you will have to be altered, either the top or the hem or both.  when you go for the fitting for alterations, make sure you wear the shoes you'll be wearing on your wedding day, and don't hold your breath and puff out your chest as they pin it around you.  just breathe regular in order to leave space in the gown so it's comfy on your wedding day.  if it's too tight they can let it out almost a whole size, or take it in if it's too large.  but once you have your fitting and they start the alterations, it's best not to try to lose any weight.  a friend of mine last summer continued to diet and exercise between the time the dress was fitted and the wedding date, and it didn't fit her right at all.  at the last minute they had to cinch it in on her and it still wasn't right.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Dresses will stretch out an inch or so when repetedly tried on.  If your dress was tight when you tried it on, why didn't they order the next size up for you.  You can alwaysalter a dress down.  Not so much up.  That being said, David's Bridal has been doing this for a long time.  They know what they're doing so you should be fine.  THey could always reorder your dress!  YOu do have until September.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Corset dresses are good in that they allow a little extra room if needed.  You need to be able to breathe and the ladies at the store will now how tight or how loose to tie the corset.    EDIT - start thinking about a healthy exercise/diet progam.  you have until september.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	That's way too tight.  Yes satin does stretch.  I tried on a size 4 at Davids Bridal as well and it fit perfectly.  When I custom ordered my dress, i couldn't get it within 4 inches of my back.  They had to send it back and order one size up--despite the fact that in the store the size 4 still fit perfectly.  Mine was Oleg Cassini line and YES dresses do stretch when 200 people have tried them on before you, no matter what other people tell you.  That's how dress makers stretch them too.    If it took 2 people to zip it, it is WAY too tight.  What if they can't get it zipped on the big day?  What if when they pull it, they rip a bit of it?  You do not want to be forced to lose 10 lbs.  They say most brides do but I didn't.  A dress that tight is not going to be flattering and who wants to look fat on their wedding day.  No one can tell if you ordered a size 8 or 10 but what they can see is that she is popping all out of that dress and has those fat pockets under the arm.  And you'll notice it in all the pictures.    Order at least one size up from what you just tried on in the store.  Then when it arrives try it on.  Like I said, mine was a good 3 inches difference.  There was no miracle on earth that could have made the ordered dress zip like the sample did.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	you can get it let out an inch or so.     it should be tight, like, you shouldnt have to pull it up every 30 seconds if its strapless ( i didnt look yet, sorry)|`|woOeYFrEaa	Two things...    Find a good seamstress now.  Don't use David's Bridal.  Ask friends or look one up in the yellow pages go see them and have a fitting and get their honest feedback.  Someone that is good at what they do can see if the dress can be let out any, if certain kind of "foundation garments" (aka corsets) will help you fit, etc.    If the seamstress doesn't think they can make alterations to make the dress work you have time to order another one (David's Bridal I'm sure will not give you any kind of refund--they have that all over their policies that all sales are final).  Or you can find a gym, hire a personal trainer and try to slim down enough to fit.  Weight Watchers or some other program could also be useful.  We're talking 8 months...that should be plenty of time to lose a little weight.    Good luck!|`|pub2GLZPaa	Well, I am a bit confused, because that dress is not a corset back.    If you did have a corset back, (where it laces up the back), then you shouldn't have anything to worry about except maybe what is spilling over the top.    For that dress though, as long as you've tried on the size you ordered and haven't gained or lost weight, it should still fit nicely.    Dresses won't get bigger because they are tried on a handful of times by other brides.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	Ok, so I am a wedding planner, and I can tell you there has been more than one occassion where the bride was having a ridiculously hard time breathing or felt like she was going to pass out because the dress was too tight. So I don't feel that your concerns are not normal. You want it to be fitted. When you try it on, sit in the dress, and move around in it. It should be comfortable. Obviously with a corsette top it is going to be tight, but again make sure you can breath. Yes it can stretch a little, so you may want to wear it a few times (very carefully) to help if it is too tight, because you are right the one in the shop is probably stretched out. If it feels too tight ask the alterations person what your options are. They may be able to put a piece of material inside to help while you are at your reception. Good luck and congrats|`|kc68BXwTaa	Call and see if you can order another size up. It's easier to take something in than let it out, and if it's only been two days, the order might not have been processed yet.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	once you get the dress try it on and make sure it fits...try sitting on it..you are going to be sitting, dancing, eating and drinking..so make sure you are able to do all that...    if u feel its too tight, start exercising and cut some calories on your diet..but dont loos too much weight ..just enough so you can breath...    good luck|`|fUBWB88laa	For one, that dress is a zip back not a corset style. So if it's tight they will let it out for you. It's going to cost more than if they were taking it in, but thats just how it goes. Secondly every girl who tries on dresses at DB is trying on the sample dress, then it's ordered in...that's ALWAYS how it goes, even as smaller boutiques with high end designers, your dress is always ordered in. And normally after the dress is in, you go get it fitted and altered and then have it checked a few more times before the wedding to make sure everything is right. I think you are being paranoid but I don't see how the dress doesn't come any bigger than size 16....that's weird. Unless you got it on sale and that's all that was left.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	It shouldn't have stretched too much in the store, but if you're truly having fit issues and they can't alter it as is you can always have a seamstress convert it to a corset back for you - it's way more forgiving that a zipper, and would cost in the region of $50-$100 to do the alteration.  Don't worry - you'll get to wear your dress!
j2yhjBDiaa	You should be very, very wary of him. I don't want to freak you out, but this reminds me of Mark Hacking, who killed his wife a few years ago after she found out that he had lied about going to & getting into medical school. I know this situation is extreme, but you need to be very cautious of someone who would lie to you for seemingly no reason. The fact that this is a PATTERN of behavior for him is very troublesome. Marriage HAS to be built on trust, & you obviously can't have that with a person who continuously lies to you. Honestly, for your own safety, well-being, & quality of life, you should get out NOW!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	he lies because he's immature and he doesn't want to accept responsibility for his actions (or inaction, in this case).    do yourself a huge favor and don't marry him.  as long as he continues to lie like this then he's someone you can't depend on and you HAVE to be able to depend on your spouse.|`|0gOWh0z2aa	If your fiance lies about major things, you should proceed with great caution.

I hope this helps.|`|sspuxjyraa	You don't want either of you to have an affair or become a walkaway, do you?    You are going to need to start communicating.  This means both of you.  If either of you are resisting this, then you need to seek marriage counseling (you've been together long enough, you don't need the marriage certificate to get in).  One or both of you might need individual counseling as well.  The fact that you never argue suggests that you don't deal with conflict very well.    I used to hate when people suggested counseling, but I am becoming more wise in my old age.  Everyone could use some help sometimes.  Good luck, I was glad to see that you love him very much.  Make sure you tell him this, but really tell him -- not just the 'I love you' at bedtime.  Relationships can get stale, it can take work to keep them fun and exciting.  Maybe some people don't have to work at it, but I think that most do.      Does he ever talk about sex?  Maybe he is just sexually insecure or shy, and needs you to take some initiative.  See if you can open him up to talk about it a bit.  Maybe it's something else.  Counseling will help.  If you're worried about what you'll find out in counseling, don't be.  You need to be open, honest, and intimate with yourselves and each other or the relationship will be doomed.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its time you got him off the lounge ..and back in to bed .. so you can make love more ..ok|`|j7l9gavRaa	you guys are just roomates (friends) it is no longer a romantic relationship  if you want to make it one again you guys should sit down and talk

Don't forget to dab a little perfume on you. That would be the best gift for him under $50. Happy anniversary.|`|j7l9gavRaa	take a weekend trip somewhere or go out for a nice dinner buy him some new clothes|`|AA11724710	Cook him a nice dinner, or mabye together, I know this might sound a little weird but get him flowers, (LOL) he'll be flattered|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Depend how long together and married or not? For you with 50 bucks budget is a bit tricky....what about a belt? so you can TIE him up where ever he is? sorry I mean he could think about you everywhere he is.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I think a affordable date is to make a candlelit dinner with slow music in the background. Make something affordable like spagetti with salad, and breadsticks, you can get a nice wine for 10 bucks called lambrushchi that is falovrful and not to heavy it is alot liek a grapejuice and easy to drink. then maybe take a nice bublle bath together and stay in all night making love until the son comes up. Also get a little gift or something like a cake with your names on it or something he likes.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	You are asking the wrong people!  You need to pick something he would love... so if I say "take him out for pizza and then to a college hockey or basketball game" it could be the best idea ever... unless he hates pizza and sports!|`|Syn2MwSHaa	cook a nice low lit dinner with a bottle wine put in your most seductive wear after dinner lead him to bed and feed him chocolate covered strawberries and let the fun begin  mildred is my leader
aO5uVFwIaa	You shouldn't have to to ask anyone! If you like it, that should be good enough! If your bf hates it, well that's tough, but it's already cut and so just try and be happy with it! It's not like your friends are going to hate you and your bf will break up with you just because a haircut! If they do, then it is definitely for the better because people who base there friends on appearance, aren't good friends anyway! If you like it, be happy with it and don't act like your life sucks because a haircut! People will respect you so much more if you just own that you love it, and they will start to love it a lot more too!|`|yuOuoCfDaa	First off what do you care...you got the haircut because YOU initially liked it right.  Then that is all that should matter.  That is the problem with alot of people these days everyone is so caught up with what the next person "thinks" or what they are doing.  I am not telling you to be a rebel or a nut but possessing qualities as such help you to be who you are and understand what it is in life that interest you in addition to help with your growth whether spiritual or physical.  Okay now what are you going to do, be miserable because you hair is short.....just remember you liked it that is why you did it.  If you hate it let it be because your either tired of it or you yourself have grown weary of it.  Okay you may trust your boyfriends judgement but he also has to respect you.  Alot of relationships lack respecting the other person views interest likes dislikes, no matter how crazy and weird it may be.  Just remember at the end of the day when you take every thing away (family, boyfriend, friends, aquaintences, business partner, etc. the list goes on) all you really have is you. You have to live with who you are and not what someone else wants you to be.  Not what you have learned from parents or adapted to through peer pressure.  The most important thing is your happiness, so learn what that is and who YOU are and everything else will fall into place from there.  We are not all perfect, but that is the beauty of life and all that it has to offer, but you have to be aware of that and want to grow accordingly.  NEVER TRUST anyone with matters concerning you and your essence!!!  That person MUST in someway prove or show that regardless of what you do, say or believe they LOVE you just the way you are, and you will know that person when they do enter your life......good luck|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Trust No one!|`|xqan4ChSaa	if they say its ok then its ok|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Well the good news is that your hair will grow.  Some people are too nice to tell you that it looks bad or they actually do like it.  Some people are petty and caddy and they tell you one thing to your face and something else behind your back.  If you have friends like that, then their not true friends.  A true friend would say you're hair doesn't look great but let me help you find a new way to style it.  If you really don't like it, go back to the hairdresser and ask them to fix it.  Short hair is really in right now so make it funky.  And like I said before, it will grow back!|`|UCO7blmKaa	well.. ur friends will tell you everything as long as they think it makes u feel good... your bf will tell you a somewhat truth answer non unless ur bf is just being a jerk.. also depends on how long u've been w/ him.    i think you should ask your self if u like it... if u like it then thats the end of it... who care about what other people say, now if u dont like it.. then u might wanna get in touch w/ toni n guy and see if there's anything that can be done about it!|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Who cares, do YOU like it?  "Those who mind don't matter, those who matter don't mind." - Seuss|`|NEWbh3Plaa	If you like it that is the only thing that matters.  Its only hair-it will grow back!!|`|JA2CazSSaa	Boyfriend, girls normally are caddy and seeing you having a bad haircut makes them look pretty. The ones who say they just liked it care about your feelings too much to tell you it looks bad. Short hair looks bad on 98% of girls|`|3KSTyYKvaa	Who gives a flip about what they think, your the one who has to live with it. Find a way to style is differently and make the best of it until it grows out.|`|uAt5NIk6aa	of course everyone is going to have a different opinion on it.    most guys like long strait hair, but girls just like what they think is cute, or what suits you.     My hair is curly and i got it cut, its shoulder length.   alot of my friends said it was to short, & my bofriend didnt really like it. but they got used to it, and it grew out.    i hope this helps, and remember its not what they like.  its what you like (:|`|4FEDMxbTaa	ask your mom!
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I am sure he would find it arousing no matter how you went about it. Maybe you could explore a little bit and step outside of the box a little bit. If this is something that you are comfortable with and see it as an avenue to bring pleasure to your husband, then you should experiment with objects other than that pillow... good luck and have fun with him. Congrats on the marriage... I think that one of the most important things is to remember that sex is fun and it really is one of the perks of being married... build trust and affection by sharing yourselves with each other.|`|vz0tsPStaa	Don't they all want to do that?    he'll probably like that you do it differently.    it's kinda hot.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Of course you need to share your little secret with him, he will find it as erotic and sexual.  There is no need for embarrassment, your married now and you need to explore and have fun with each other.  Good luck.|`|TD0aaSQQaa	yeah just go ahead and tell him. if he thinks it weird then, oh well, he doesnt get to watch you! we as women need to stop worrying what men will think. it sucks. its not natural to act like a porn star during sex for most of us, but then we find ourselves acting for our men. just be yourself =).|`|AA11990465	I think  you should try to masturbate for him, after all you don't know how you look when you masturbate and it's up to him to decide if you look sexy when you do it. As for the pillow, you can share that secret if you wish to and if you don't that is ok. Everyone is entitled to a secret as long as it's not hurting anyone else.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	He is probably more interested in witnessing you getting yourself off rather than looking like a porn star. Go ahead and do it. He will love it.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Don't tell him and that's is sick!|`|434c6f306298f12f4324bc49555661cbaa	give in to his request, and use the pillow. Close your eyes and do what you've been doing all along...I'm sure after a very short period your husband will interact with you...ask him to masterbate along with you.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Your mistake is thinking that because you don't masturbate like the girls in porn, it's not sexy.  But I guarantee you, if you get off when you masturbate, it is most definitely, 100% certainly sexy!  Please, get over your embarrassment and grant your husband's wish - as a man, I am rooting for him to get what he wants.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Pillow! just use your finger, he is your husband after all.|`|haCssg2Laa	and does your husband have sex with you like he is a porn star??    course he doesnt  porn is a fantasy type commodity  every so often we indulge in parts that may have come from the set of a porn movie, sure, but most of the time, its how we like it and get off on it, he wont expect you to do it like a porn star, the thrill for him is watching you enjoying an intimate moment, however you do it  watching you will excite him and in return will excite you more  go for it|`|X1YVUA5oaa	I would just be yourself and do it the way you always do, I'm sure he'll like it. I wouldn't be shy to tell him he'll probably think its hot or what not, I would.|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	OMG...I haven't humped a pillow since I was like 14.  God those were the days...anyway..porn masturbating...that's not even real.  watching you should be way better if he can decipher the difference between you as the reality and the porn stars.  do what you do, however you do it, and he'll love it.  And I assure you, the things he does in his alone time are probably way more embarrassing than you humping a pillow.  remember, he's a guy...|`|ON84EQaBaa	My husband and I have been married 38 yrs. like others say men get off on seeing you masturbate, what ever it takes to keep him happy (with in reason) do it, its better to do what he likes at home than have him go out in the streets looking for someone who will. You might get a kick out of it seeing how much he's enjoying it! AND THE REWARDS ARE GREAT!|`|nwNkXEO3aa	Well, this depends on your opinion if he will react negatively. If yes, then don't tell him. And since he asked you to masterbate in front of him, I believe he sees you as someone even better than the porn stars. Or I should say, which husband won't see their wife as their most beloved, and the person who is everything to him. If that person isn't, then the guy won't marry her already.|`|xGshAiXOaa	He's the one other person in this world that is supposed to know everything there is to know about you.  Indulge him.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	A pillow I hope you washed it...have him take you to a store and purchase a big girl masturbating tool..leave the pillow in your past of girl sleep overs. Try it your marriage at least your spouse is communicating with you and telling you what he wants and not seeking it from someone else..go for it|`|1EwbKkKCaa	well you may think its embarrassing but he may think it's hot. I think it is very important to keep your husband interested. And if it feels good without the one you love think how much better it will be if you do involve him... But really a pillow??  I'm just wondering how that works.|`|AA12159712	Even if you are newlyweds, it depends on how much sex you two had premaritally. And of course how much variation you two expereinced together in sex acts. If he knows you used to do it, he may be curious to see and thinks it would be a new way for him to peak his performance for stimulation. A pillow, a banana, a cucumber, or vibrator may just give him maximum stimulation in performance. He may be the type who will want to try other new "experiments" in the future to keep lovelife fresh in the bedroom as well.|`|3vbHZBioaa	He is your husband you should not feel embarrassed to masturbate in front of him..There is absolutely nothing wrong with masturbation trust me girls know what they like and how they like it...Have Fun he will be so excited and I am 100% sure he will join in you'll have a blast...I just opened a Adult on-line Store check it out www.thegspot.biz I have over 4,000 items to choose from great prices and selection..Have Fun and Good Luck!!|`|4gEU73sAaa	If he really wants to watch you do it, he can't complain about the way you do it.  Just let him know that this is how you do it and if he doesn't like it, he won't ask you to do it again.|`|jL7XdxzBaa	oops .....any way ,i am Buddhist lord Buddha said ''in front of your husband ,behave like a bad girl you know what i mean .but if you don't like it you don't have to|`|dprURFLxaa	All men love it and they don't care how they just want to see you get off.
oS1TBzL6aa	Tell him you have to lick it before you stick it.    Cheers,   A.T. Cunningham|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Tell him that is your favorite act and that it would be nice if he understood that for the sex to be fun for you also, you need him to do that.  And if you want him to do it until you get over the finish line each time as well, tell him that also.  Men usually respond well to direct communication.  If he has a problem with this, you need to replace him.  PS, this is why my wife and I always take a quick shower before we hop into bed :) :)|`|AA12324252	Scream in his ear ' EAT ME'|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You grab a hold of his hair with passion and push his head in the direction it needs to go to give you the pleasure you desire.  He will get the hint and you will get what you need also.  It is okay to talk about it, but at the time, just let your passion take control.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Get a picture of a fish and point to it.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Just tell him!  Baby...go downtown!!!|`|oxmkllnWaa	tell him BEFORE HAND that "you know I like it when you give me oral sex so much I want it ALL THE TIME"....     this avoids the awkward situation where you ask him for it when you're pinning him down such that he can't get into position to give it to you without dumping you on the floor.     and some women do NOT seem to want it all the time some do...     and every woman likes it differently.    so if you want your partner to give you oral sex all the time tell them straight out that you want it all the time... and if they're not doing it like you want it it's up to you to teach them how YOU like it.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	Just sit on his face|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Tell him in a sexy voice, "I really want to feel your tongue on my ***** right now."|`|nAK82h6vaa	Just tell him what you want.I'm sure he will agree to it|`|ByUS0k8waa	Just tell him or you could do just what men do and push his head down.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Tell him you need for him to take a really close look at your hoohaa that something down there needs oral attention.|`|TVz2UoOyaa	start by making sexy moves and when he likes it then push his head down there..thats it!|`|f6YsGOynaa	Just bat your eyes at him and say, "Hey baby, how about a little licky licky before we get busy, hmmmm?"|`|8jBGhsWPaa	ask him what turns him on.. what he likes you doing and what pleases him the most.. then bring up what you like him doing.. tell him you think he should do it more often because it feels really good.. in result ask him what you should do more of for him. talk to him during tell him what feels good and what doesnt whether he is going to fast or too slow, whether he should use hes hands aswell.. make sure you are totally satisfeid. Dont be affraid to talk to your partner because alot of men enjoy pleasing their partners and get turned on/ pleased with themselves knowing they have got their girlfriend to reach orgasm. by telling your boyfriend this is your favourite sexual activity he will want to do it more and more and showing him how you like it will give you more intense orgasms|`|hrFGKAeraa	Just tell him.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	don't ask him push his head down.|`|oMIxJTO1aa	sit on his face... push his head down...or tell him directly while doing either or of the above haha. If anything it should be a turn on for him, it is when my girl does haha. Best of Luck!!|`|pd5LkFWoaa	Just tell him.. Also be honest and tell him that you want it every single time and that you dont want to ask him and that you want to become a permenant part of your sex life...|`|fRIEHBJOaa	"i want oral sex"      why do people make simple things so complex    EDIT: i just would like to add that this is best said BEFORE sex, not during.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Just tell him.      When he does it for you, make sure the whole experience is really great for him, and when he doesn't, make it not so great for him. Maybe he'll realize that you're a better lover when you get what you want.  Or he might not, I dunno.  It worked on my boyfriend.|`|FzFSzilmaa	tell him sex would be better if he did it spontaneously... ;)    or sit there, with things ready and ORDER him to do what is required...    text him with instructions right now... tell him what you want and how... :D|`|pRbZNnHcaa	Grab him buy his ears and pull him down there. Take charge...LOL|`|lOSSXKWIaa	Damn just put his mouth right where you want it.  I think he will like it.  My hubby does.  Good luck!!!|`|SS1FFafRaa	Don't ask for it every time.  He'll get tired of doing it.  It will become a job he HAS to do.    an old girlfriend was very dry because of her birth control, so i had to go down EVERY time.  Which i've always loved going down, so at first it was great, but if you HAVE to do something every time, it eventually gets old and isn't fun.    Let him do it when he wants, and ask occasionally.  Or do him first, or get in a 69 position.  Keep it random.    *edit*  One more thing... ask/tell him you want it in a creative way.  Don't say "will you go down on me" every time.  say, something like, "I want your tongue between my thighs"  the dirtier the better in general.|`|dprURFLxaa	Make it kinky.  how about..."My p*ssy wants your tongue"...or "put that tongue on my cl*t."  My man loves it when I get straight to the point instead of "will you go down...", or asking in a non-sexual way, etc.  Also, my man loves it when I TELL him what to do rather than ASK him.  That gets him SO horny...orders and commands.|`|jbxGEdVbaa	I really feel for you sweetheart. The Hamburglar wouldn't have any problems going down and petting the cat for you. It sucks that you need to direct this guy on every way to make you feel good. Unfortunately, a lot of guys are like this. Heck, sometimes The Hamburglar just wants to penetrate the blow hole and get it over with so he can have a sandwich. Maybe you should try putting things in that area that would interest him more. How about a can of beer or a bag of chips? Peanut butter would do the trick for me. Hope this helps your miserable sexual outing.    -You've just been sacked by The Hamburglar|`|AxkVvgBFaa	generally, when i proposition a woman for some good knob polishing, it's usually happening before they realize it.  when they do realize, they sheepishly accept.      on the off chance they are quick enough to spot me moving in for the killing stroke, they generally leap with rabid lust toward the prize.      since the situation is reversed and you are dealing with a man you need to be blatant as men don't comprehend anything else.  you probably want to put up neon signs in the house - giant arrows leading upstairs and to the bedroom.  when he enters he should find you bare and sprawled out on the bed, spread eagle....bald eagle.      he should then find numerous warning signs like "caution" and "enter at your own risk" near your mattress.  he  would normally shy away after seeing this but you will also have cleverly placed his favorite snacks near your cooch to entice him in.  leave a bread crumb style trail of peanuts or pretzels that end at your vag and he will unknowingly begin to feast on your beef jacket.    enjoy!      happily lubricated,    -Mayor McCheese|`|kUZEYNmNaa	It does kind of kill the spontaneity by having to ask for it. Okay how about making clear how much you appreciate it. Every time he does give you oral. make a special effort during love making after wards, soon he'll make the connection between pleasing you orally and you paying special attention to him. Also be a little bit vocal when he's doing it, I'm not talking about faking anything if you're not naturally loud, just talk to him, use a little language or make sounds that you wouldn't otherwise.    Guys have an ego when it come to sex and satisfying the woman their with. Without manipulating him its something you should play to.|`|uz8n7Vq0aa	step 1. get him in bed  step 2. go onto the bed wearing just robe ( wear bra and thongs for sexual effect"  step 3.say in sexy voice " I want your tounge on my ***** hot thang"  step 4. take off robe  step 5. kiss passionatley  step 6.say something sexy and lay on top of him... vagina to penis  step 7. pull down his pants if he is in the mood you have  step 8. have oral sex|`|nrDlwYuVaa	tap his shoulder and then point down.|`|1pgIayv3aa	Dont you wish there was a greeting card for this subject?  You can try to rule out some obvious things that might be making him hesitate before you actually have to sit him down and ask if hes gay.  Try foreplay in the shower; is he more eager with improved hygiene?  Try different grooming styles, he might like a landing strip over the traditional V, or even smooth as a whistle.  Last but not least, are you doing your part orally?  When a man isnt getting head hes not always willing to give it!!!|`|2PfY0Neiaa	Simply talk to him sweetly and then be like I want Oral. Straight to the point and it solves the problem. Oral is very relaxing too|`|YrZ4AhpNaa	Tell him "give it to me now!' in a sexy voice then jump on him naked! oh yeah!!!
029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	People like to have control of all aspects of other people so they can be sure they're safe and well taken care of. It's not a bad quality to care so much, but it does become suffocating for the person being protected. You need to allow people to grow and develop on their own, without your constant watchful eye on them. My mother made all my decisions for me growing up and now I can't make a decision to save my life. There are long-term consequences.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	im overprotective! i dont think its a bad thing at all. (i do know when to draw the line though.) For example, if a friend of mine, or my sister is about to make a forseeable mistake, i'll warn them, or tell them that the same thing happened to me, and then if they still want to do whatever it is, i let em, and being the chump that i am, always listen when they come back, whining.|`|vtafeEIJaa	No one has security because there is no security...What is protecting you is inveted by someone else and its possible others got the same idea or technology that you dont know....|`|d0b4766c80603988f62747e14effa4e7aa	The key to any relationship is communication. This is irrespective of the fact that you are not comfortable talking to either one of them. There is always a first time for everything. Having said that also remember that timing and context of any conversation is always important.   Find out which parent is more lenient, and always work to bring him or her over to your point of view before asking for something from the other parent. For example, if you want to go to a party, and you know your mom is more relaxed about it, persuade her first, then she will be on your side when you talk to your dad. Parents try to work as a unit, and if you split them up they will be weaker.   Know your parents' weaknesses. Use them to your benefit.   Compromise. Buy yourself a cell phone, and promise that if you are allowed to go out, you will call your parents every 30 or so minutes to let them know you're ok. Calmly discuss things, and try to work out a solution that suits you both. Remember, your parents want you to be happy, but they also want you to be safe.   Act responsibly. You can't expect your parents to treat you like an adult if you still act like a kid. Clean your own room, offer to look after younger siblings, and don't throw hissy fits, etc.   Know that dating can be a big issue for everyone with overprotective parents (mostly girls). Reassure your parents that so-and-so is respectful to you, kind etc. If your partner doesn't object, then arrange a meeting between them and your parents. Carefully groom your partner, so he/she will come across well. But not too much, or they will appear creepy.   Realize that sometimes, your parents really do know best.   Have patience. Don't expect your parents' attitudes to change overnight. Slowly build their trust, always be home by the time they said, and stick to the rules that you've both agreed on. Gradually, your parents will realize that they can trust you to be responsible and start giving you more freedom without you even having to ask!   Do something for your parents without any ulterior motives. May be a joint dinner date once a month or just buying them small gifts during a special day. That will send the message to them that you are growing up as a responsible adult and can be trusted.          TipsRemember birthdays, mother and father's days etc. Buy appropriate gifts, and use these events to spend quality time with your parents.   If your parents are incredibly overprotective and strict, suggest family therapy; they may have issues they need to overcome.   Never lie. If they find out, it will ruin all the hard work you put into gaining their trust.   Even if they agree to loosen up, remember that they will STILL be protective in a lot areas   Just because they say no, doesn't mean they are OVER-protective. They care about you.   If you know someone in your neighborhood hang out with them, slowly increasing your boundaries until they encompass friends houses, movie theaters, fun places, etc.   Remember that not everyone can be protected.

What she did was very wrong and childish, but for you to ignore it is also wrong. Be assertive and let your mom know that YOU know she has them, and how dare she stop you from moving on with your life. Let her know that although you KNOW that she has helped you out with shelter and food, you want to be independent. Assure her that you will keep in contact with her and call her, and do NOT let her fool you with any melodramatics that she may have. Stop being so childish yourself and stand up to her, your a man, not a little boy.|`|4fe7c48ee8b892832c04be92742c7894aa	You need to step up and become a man. If you can't handle your mother...

1U9YtSW3aa	If you are feeling down and out, and don't know what to do to get out of that horrible state of mind, the following can help you considerably overcome this seemingly impossible hurdle to climb over:     Know that you are still in control. You control the depression, not the other way around. Letting the depression get the best of you will undoubtedly make it more difficult to overcome. Remind yourself that you are ultimately in control, and that this is a phase, and that it's not staying forever.    Talk about it. Keeping these issues and feelings inside may make them grow and get worse over time. Therefore, it could be beneficial for you to discuss this with someone, anyone that you trust and can confide in. Friends and family are there to support you in your time of need, and this is an issue where there is no shame into discussing it.    Go outside. Naturally, the environment and nature makes us feel better. The fresh air, the sounds of the birds, the trees, it has a positive affect on us. Take a walk outside, in a park, in a forest, and you will notice how better you will feel. When you are surrounded by the beauty of nature, you will instantly start feeling better.    Move around. The more you move your body, the better you will feel. Do some exercises, or any activity where you are active and moving, and you will notice that your mood will change. Most people that are depressed are people that lack physical activity.    Talk to your Higher Power. No matter what you believe in, take a moment to talk to your God, your angel, or universal spirit that you know is there and hears you. Pour your heart out, and let all your emotions out. Not only you will feel better, but you will certainly start understanding it all better and start getting the answers you are looking for.    Remember to never ever give up. Life isn't always an easy ride, but there is always light at the end of the tunnel; there is always sunshine after a rainy day. It's not the end of it all, and greater things are in store for you down the line :)|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	You're question is kind of vague.|`|AA11570236	Surround yourself with friends and family.|`|lYjweuZmaa	It will be okay. have faith.         God bless|`|f6YsGOynaa	Get some counseling. You sound depressed.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Talk to a counselor. Always have faith even when its bad god has a plan for us.|`|AA10748233	I know exactly how you feel. I wish I had some good advice for you but all I can say is try to find someone to confide in, and don't spend all your time alone. I'm literally stuck at home (with no legal car to drive) with a 5 month old baby (whom I love dearly) and some days I feel like I'm just going to fall apart. The only thing that keeps me together is the fact that I need to stay strong and positive for my baby. If it wasn't for her, I may have considered offing myself by now. I know that sounds terrible but it's the truth. I know this really isn't advise, and probably not very helpful but I just wanted you to know that I can relate. Good luck to you. Take care!|`|gYyW39wTaa	Take it day by day|`|boIRASS7aa	Wecome to my world.  I was wouded in Afghanistan last week and now they tell me I might lose my leg....  What is your complaint today?    Wecome to reality!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	fidn things to do to keep busy. start walking the block a healthy walk is good for getting the spirits up.|`|wlupqLrBaa	Honey don't worry, we all have bad times, some more than others. Pick your chin up and try to focus on the good things in your life. Could you be more specific with what your going through? That way maybe we could help more. If you find it hard to open up talk to your doctor about counseling, it's always confidential. There are even free phone numbers to help lines if your feeling that low. But please don't act on your feelings, time is a healer, honestly!! Get in touch through my profile if you want to chat more, sometimes talking to a stranger can be easier x x
upazUCA6aa	Look Cute  and wear booty shorts   It always Help ;)|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	you know you're gorgeous. Just say "Hi, Im (whatever your name is)" and he;ll say hi too! Start talking. Be yourself, be cool and try not to act as goofy as you might feel. Just relax!|`|08y217Rdaa	Easy come, easy go. Find your own best way to get his attention.   If you don't feel enough to get over yourself and your fears you might find later that it's all worth nothing.|`|eu3Gi5BNaa	ya youre REAALLLLLLLLLLLLLY pretty!     just say hi to him! keep it simple|`|5r48jn7iaa	don't freak out. just chat with him on facebook a little, at school, get to know him. and things will just go from there.|`|BbEo2HOzaa	Hey Madison,    Slow down.  You don't even know this boy and already you are acting as if he is to die for.  Start talking to him, say "hi."  Get to know him first and see if you can see if he has anything in common with you, movies, music etc.  Open the lines of communication.  Slow is the rule, Don't throw yourself at him,     Once you establish contact, get to know him, and decide if you still are attracted to him. If you are, then let him make the next move.  If he does not take it to the next level with you, then move on.      Make a list of the qualities you want in a guy, confidence, humor, responsible, gentle, caring etc.  If he meets your standards, then continue to make contact with him.  Learn the subtle communication techniques of body language.      Remember, 'A person wants most what he can't have."  Make contact then make your self scarce.  Works every time.    Good luck.|`|hclmWIzmaa	Get naked.|`|gUMonqNTaa	Well since you added him on facebook why dont you kind of start talking to him on there? and when you start to do that you can start to say hi to him in the hall way... It doesnt matter if you are pretty enough guys like confidence in girls, thats what you need to have...|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	First of all don't dress in any sort of way uh, revealing because thats the wrong way to do it. But you should really just ask him out some place casual. Not a date or anything. Maybe you could even invite your friend and do some sort of double thing or whatever. A group going out some place. Maybe some sort of event, or meet after school. You'll get a chance to talk with him and to introduce yourself. But I would try to ask him out anyway because I think you got what it takes. Your attractive. :D|`|0pLva8nLaa	message him start a convo. ask what he is doin on the weeken and say we should chill soon|`|5vMmodYnaa	I usually comment on something irrelevant to get the talk going.    btw, hes lucky ;)|`|uQswOjy9aa	when you walk by him say hi he will probably talk back. Then the next time complement him it will make his day he will soon want to talk to you a little more and want to get to know you.|`|g4gWHE2Naa	you should stop stressing so much eyy, your going overboard considering you dont even know him yet.  i have had an experience like this and i thought i really liked this guy but he turned out to be a total jerk,  this guy soundss good thoughhh :) im just warning you.  your way cutes so you shouldn't have a problem with him thinking your hot etc.  ignore the people who are telling you to flash him -.- they're just horny weirdos.  you should find out a class or something that you have in common and talk to him about it :) if none, just when hes talking to your friends ask them before hand to introduce you and if you've already been introduced say a nice hello how are you ? type thing. be really happy, smiley and confident!  if you keep talking to him like this, he should soon get the picture that you like him :D|`|8uhJFdOMaa	send him a message over facebook and say something like, ive seen you around school, whats up.    thats what i used to do at your age. hehe.    and you're really cute, hes not going to turn you down|`|fV47ExCRaa	kidnap him. feed him edible thongs. make him your *****. werewolf|`|DeWTdwUBaa	Tell him when u think its the right time..but it would be eaiser over photo bucket...|`|vHI9bgrAaa	play hard to get.|`|e6a23ac67889f43ee25e6ff968fea607aa	Hey Friend..How r u?... well...The first Impression is the Last impression...and wat i think is a guy would probably see girls smile and impression... Hearty Smile...with sparkling eyes and and a sweet luk atthem would help... if the guy need a friend in u then he would see how caring u r and how beautiful u r at ur heart rather than ur looks... Just b simple as u r... If a guy Accepts ur simplicity then he can b a great friend...    Just start the conversation by "Hi" "hello"...etc..be cool chill and calm... talking to guys is nt a big deal..    if you're not inclined to start a conversation if the man isn't looking at you, how about doing something that will get him to look at you? Something really simple, like maybe just saying "Hi".    "You know, I don't work here, but I'd just like you to know that I would help you with whatever it is that you could possibly want or need..."  Men love to talk about themselves, so asking him a few questions could be a great way to break the ice.|`|hVOYlQzHaa	Don't do anything you'll regret. Give it some time, don't move in too fast. Talk to him as a friend, get to know him better and let him get to know you. But don't let him know everything, one piece at a time. That way he WILL want to know more about you. Don't try impressing him with reveling clothes! Yeah guys say they like that, but why show off the product when they can find out on their own when YOU want them to see it all. LOL. Just become friends. Chat online first, after awhile talk at school, then ask him to hang out like at the movies or something. Make it a group thing first, then slow into the process of being alone with him. JUST TAKE IT SLOW AND DON'T FORCE YOURSELF ON HIM! OK? LOL
ndxXPie9aa	Naa. I don't agree. No pain no gain. When love is good it's great.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Love is supposed to feel good and positive. If it hurts, it's time to re-evaluate the relationship. There are times when you just have to work through the hurt but they should be few and far between. Love should make your life better.|`|AA10389562	When you bury your emotions and feelings, you bury them alive.    Learn from your mistakes and love yourself for making them.  The pain is real and powerful but you must not let it blind you to the real love waiting for you out there.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Yes, besause while it lasts it feels amazing.|`|llUVXlLKaa	Is part of life and experience you don't ever hurt you would not be human you make mistakes to correct them that's how you learn and to get hurt is just part of life|`|AA10303328	Of course! After being hurt, you truly don't want to love again, but try to remember how good it made you feel being in love. The higher you are in your passion and on Cloud 9, the harder you fall, making it hurt more. I've been there, I know the pain. The lack of appetite, no motivation, thinking all  or  are worthless of your attention. With all our feelings, time heals. You'll get there. Don't beg to be taken back, don't blame yourself, know that you are a beautiful person, and the right one will come along -- as it did for me. It's a beautiful, powerful emotion.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Have you ever thought if you hurt there feelings? I hate when people always turn it around they being hurt so bad but nevermind what they do to the other person|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	I THINK ITS TRUE,, PEOPLE SHOULD JUST HAVE FUN......GET A COUPLE, NOT PLAY THEM, COMMITT TO THEM BUT NEVER FALL IN LOVE!! CUS THATS WHEN ALL THE PROBLEMS AND PAIN START..YOU LL FIND YOUR SELF TOLERATING BAD BEHAVIOR, CRYING MOST OF TIMES AND HAVE YOUR FEELINGS CRUSHED|`|j7l9gavRaa	some love ends in hurt but i think having love for even a little while is worth the risk|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	love is the greatest thing in the world, if you find it with the right person. All relationships are going to have good and bad times and you have to lear nto deal together taht is what makes you strong. It is worth it.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Well with that thinking, then you also shouldn't be driving a car, walking across the street, and should probably invest in a big plastic bubble to protect yourself.    Every time you get into a car, you are risking getting into an accident.  You are risking your life.      Every time you walk across the street, you are risking getting hit by a car.     Every time you pet a dog, you are risking getting bit.     So I guess with your rationale we should all just live in our own little bubbles and avoid human contact at all costs.       Your friends can hurt you too.....so are you going to get rid of all your friends before they have that opportunity?      Yes, love can hurt.  Yes, it can suck.  But to me, love-even love that is broken, is worth it in the end because love is one of the greatest emotions we have.  Even if I only got to love my husband for one day, it was worth it to experience the best day of my life.      Everything you do in life can cause pain, whether it be emotional or physical...it can cause pain.  Don't gaurd your heart and fear falling in love because it is the best feeling in the world once you find the right person to love who will love you back.      Each broken heart and ended love is meant to happen.  Each one teaches us something about ourselves.  It allows us to be human and and part of being human is to experience pain and sorrow and sadness.  It allows you to grow and mature through it though and it readies you for the person you are meant to find.  If I hadn't went through all my previous broken hearts, I wouldn't have had such an incredible connection to my husband. Actually, I wouldn't have even met him.  I wouldn't have been where I was, when I was when we met.  Everything happens for a reason.....and even though you can't see that reason, God knows what he is doing.  Just trust him and allow him to guide you through it.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	You are going after the wrong type of guys. Look for guys who are kind and have many friends (this shows he is a compassionate person).    And when you enter a relationship, go in it with no expectations of him becoming a boyfriend, reserve your feelings until you have established to yourself that he is not going to break your heart.|`|4ESlizXraa	There are few things that will bring you happiness without risk of disappointment.  Love is not one of those things.  To love someone you must give them your trust and accept theirs in return.  This, almost by definition, opens us up to the possibility of being hurt by this person.    Yet, for me, the opportunity to be happy in a loving relationship is worth that risk.    Without being hurt, without the pain, disappointment and so forth of failed relationships, we would not know the joy of those moments with loved ones.  Friends would not mean as much without the trust.    What I'm saying, rather poorly, is that without the possibility of the bad things you would never know the good things.  For that matter, if someone never got hurt in a relationship would they be able to appreciate it?  How can you know you're having a good day if you've never had a bad day?    Short version is, yes, I'd rather love and get hurt than never love.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Yes I know what you mean. Love can be so powerful, when it's there it's euphoria, when it's gone it can rip your heart out. I've been on both sides of that fence a couple of times, and I blame myself for getting into those situations in the first place. Why couldn't it just stay a friendship? Because I fall in love at the drop of a hat. Then I try to convince myself that it wasn't true love, but merely companionship and sex. And as I look at things in a more mature way, that could be all that it was, but I called it love, and at the time it was there it felt so good.    For your question: Personally I will not stop my life, or put it on hold because of past mistakes and heartache. I've learned from the past, and I look forward to the future.     You have lots of love left, Find someone nice to share it with.    Good Luck    God Bless|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	As far as romantic relationships I'd much rather be loved than to love.|`|UhZSu9Ubaa	No it hurts but if u dont love u will never find the rite one|`|I4SYlBu3aa	I think you make no seance?|`|r1y8ZSmoaa	something like that happend to me, this guy was 1 grade higher than me, and we texted alot and always talked and he sent me the cute little forwards, but then he moved and didnt tell me so i thought that sometheing was up, but then i found out at school that he was going back out with his gf, and we cant even be frinds bc he wont talk to me... lol|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Love is not always pain.There are ups and downs in love but you have to decide if its worth it.|`|rPfguQwCaa	it is so complicated sister  but happiness comes from devotion,  and whens he not that devoted you can get hurt and become unhappy  just find a man who's going to devote to pleasing you....  it's not easy, but just don't make it too hard for you or the one that  will grow to care about you.  good luck and God  bless!|`|bru2xnlRaa	Love also feels very good. There are many kinds of love. I think you are probably talking about a couple's relationship. What about the mother / child relationship? Or just long time Girlfriends ?     It is true that sometimes we get our feelings hurt most by those we love the most, but we also get some of the best feelings from them too.
2MXotjmhaa	There is a Davids Bridal in Albany, though I wouldnt send my worst enemy to them intentionally. If you are looking for cheap and quick they may be your only option. I live in Saratoga and Danielles Bridal on Weibal Ave (close to Wilton Mall) is very good. There are also a few boutiues downtown but your definitely going to pay top dollar. There is also a bridal shop on Glen Street in Glens Falls. I cant think of the name at the moment but it is the only one up that way. I can tell you that they were pretty rude last time I went in there but that was a few years ago and maybe they have gotten better. Hope this helps!
hiOeQZVsaa	I'd rather be a single parent then living in a love-less marriage.  and perhaps maybe Ms. Right will come along!|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I've done both. My children and myself got better when I divorced. I was very broke but we were all happier (except for the ex).|`|h7xh61TWaa	People that "fall out" of love after having kids or just along the years just haven't worked on their relationship. When you are dating there is constant work on the relationship, then comes marriage and kids and priorities shift.  Thus people falling out of love. (Not regarding those that cheat or damage the relationship)    I don't like people "staying" unhappy for the kids. Kids in broken homes turn out fine, others have problems. It depends on how messy the separation is... But if a couple really tried, seeing counselors, working on their relationship (not the family), they might be able to reconnect.|`|f6YsGOynaa	When I had children, my life ceased to be my own.  Now my decisions must be based on what's best for the kids.  It doesn't matter what makes ME happy.  I think people who get divorced to "find themselves" are very selfish and drag their kids through a lot of crap due to their own selfishness.|`|lYjweuZmaa	staying together for the kids is stupid. everyone deserves to be happy.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	I would rather be in whichever situation had the kids staying with me. If I kept the kids either way, I guess I'd prefer to be single rather than married and unhappy.|`|j7l9gavRaa	i would rather be a single parent  there is such a stigma on this and i don't understand because i think in most cases it is the healthiest route for the parent and child  people that stay together for the kids i think are retarded and selfish it doesn't benefit the kids at all kids are not stupid and they will see an unhappy toxic relationship as an example and grow up to be in one|`|OBCvewW2aa	Some of us don't have much choice in the matter.  I rather be a single parent who has a child with an attentive, loving, supportive father, but I'm making lemonade instead.|`|Uuc3PgDnaa	it is better for the child if they split as long as both parents take an active part in bringing them up|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I would rather be a single parent. Children always grow up and they will know the truth sooner or later.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	To quote Dr. Laura,  To seperate is in the self-serving interests of the parents. Children deserve the home with both parents present. They do not derserve all the turmoil that comes with accepting step parents and step siblings and packing up their lives to go to another residence every other weekend. The kids are mostly indifferent to parents squabbling, and any major fights need to be handled not it their presence. If a seperation must happen, wait unitl the kids are old enough and beyond their formative years.|`|fTiXy11caa	It would really depend on the situation.  Abuse is not to be tolerated.  The age of the children needs to be considered as well.  personally I feel a child needs to be at least 10 years old to be able to handle a divorce, but maybe older depending on the child's emotional maturity.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	I have been divorced for 10 years. My ex was a very unfaithful man and hurt me inside deeply. However, if I had it to do over again, I would have stayed with him for our child's sake. Visitation, custody battles, mediation, child support -- what a load of ... well, I can't say the word. All I know is, she loves him. She loves me. She got torn apart when we divorced.  I wish that somehow we could have held it together. There is NOTHING better out there. He is now in another unhappy marriage, and I am an unhappy, alone single woman.  I think its sad that we couldn't hold it together for her. This isn't a politically popular belief, but you know what?  Guys, the kids come first.  Every single time.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i would rather be single .. there's to much stress in a relationship that not going any where and fighting all the time ,you don't want that stress for your kids..|`|UaSb84BOaa	I'd rather be a single parent and have a good relationship with my children's father, than be in an unhappy relationship - regardless if for the kids or not.   The children will see the unhappiness if we are together. If we are not together, and are happy, that's a better atmosphere for children.|`|Syn2MwSHaa	i am in that tyoe of situation o love her but for some reason we cant get along so we are to gether for the kids mildred is my leader|`|ceJ3O14Yaa	I would rather be a single parent   the kids know when you are unhappy wich if it lasts long enough the kids will be unhappy  trust me I know!!|`|T6nvpX6zaa	I'd rather be humble and willing to work on my marriage so I'm in a happy marriage!|`|V2r0HRKjaa	Single parent.  Being unhappy might cause bad characteristics in the kids.|`|ZCxeEwXZaa	I would say be in a unhappy relationship but at the same time work on the relationship so that it becomes happy. Do whatever it takes to not only provide a loving home to your kid(s) but also love your spouse and rekindle the relationship. In the end it will be well worth it.|`|8fd15b64214f2ed938ae8aea46720501aa	I think this day in age that you do not need to stay together for the children.  It would be nice and I know there are plenty of happily married people.  I dont think people plan or intend to be single parents, but the best thing for the child is to have at least 2 loving parents and if you can give them that regardless of being married then we will have done our job and then some.|`|g37eLIxgaa	Since that is basically what I am currently going through and have for some time now my opinion is to stay together for the children.  It does depend on the children also, some are strong and independant and some would not take the divorce well.  I have elected to remain together, I guess, at least until the kids are out of school.      *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***
pqqofz6kaa	You two obviously have something. Don't just let it go. It's so hard to find someone you truly like. Don't jump ahead straight away in thinking he's gonna ask you back out a third time, he's probably scarred from all the previous rejection. If you started talking again don't ignore him. Don't be clingy either. Just talk normally as friends. He hangs out with a girl, that doesn't mean anything, if you can find out how long they've been hanging and you can see how into each other they are!  If you can't anyway doesn't matter!!!  Just talk as mates, see if he starts being flirty with you again, maybe you can ask him out for a drink this time??   But make sure this time there's no one else in the way, stopping you.    Good luck!|`|zRil0vjhaa	Overcome your fears girl! You already sound like you know what to do. You should totally call him...you don't have anything to lose, and a whole lot to gain, it sounds like. You know that you want to start as his friend and build the realtionship from there. So jump in!  PS don't worry too much about the other girl but do make sure you ask him before it gets too deep if their relationship is something serious. Have fun!|`|KBU2X921aa	Well first off i am glad that he was able to move on because getting shut down twice must be the hardest feeling, especially after he thought you liked him too. But in this case you are in now i would sit down with him and tell him exactly how you feel. (i would suggest saying sorry for the other times before this) If you are honest with him about how you are feeling then even if he doesn't want anything back at least you know you tried. If it doesn't work out you two can talk about being close friends and maybe having something in the future. But really, sit down with him and just let everything out on the table. I am positive that it will work out no matter what the outcome is.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI AHMFORMS,,,,HEY HIS GIVEN U LOTS O F CHANCES,,,SO HIS REALLY INTERESTED IN YOU,,,SO WHY NOT BCOME HIS FRIEND AGAIN,,,AND IF HE ASK YOU OUT,,,GO OUT WITH HIM,,U DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING U DONT WANT TO,,,AND THIS FRIEND OF HIS MUST NOT MEAN THAT MUCH TO HIM OR HE WOULDNT B TRYING TO GET YOU TO NOTICE HIM,,,AGAIN,,,,PEACE|`|p7eUxwFkaa	listen.... What ever you were doing to make him like you the first time repeat it and then when he asks you out, don't go falling for another guy.  Hope it helps :D|`|K7ePv3Wqaa	hmm... well, i can totally relate to the feeling intimidated part lol.   Before u make any move, u need to ask urself if ur interested in him romantically, or as just a friend. if its just as a friend, remain neutral. i wouldn't recommend communicating in a way thats out of the ordinary for the both of u because u may end up leading him on. It also sounds like u may have only decided to notice him now because there's another girl; is jealousy the only reason for pushing u towards him? if so, back off. let him live his life.   But, if u really do like him, & ur pretty sure of it, i'd say go for it. Call him, talk to him on myspace, idk anything... just don't overdo it, obviously. if u call him 3 times a day or leave him a dozen messages, it will be an obvious instant turn off.   i wish u the best of luck =]  ~peace~|`|rRCZq1tBaa	i dont really know how to answer this..... but i do know if he got shut down twice and came back for more your somethin special|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	I think you need to take a plunge here and put yourself on the line the way he did multiple times. Good luck getting him to ask you out again - it's not gonna happen. You did what you had to do, and I'm glad you didn't date him if you had feelings for another guy. It's your turn to ask this guy out but only if you're sure you're ready, and not just because there's no one else in the picture right now or because he looks better than he used to. Catch my drift?|`|fa37a0de0a5be40d26be97dc0e9e16b8aa	talk to him call him on the phone if you don't you will reget it. whats the worst that can happen he doesn;t like you then you will be able to get over him that muvh sonner  good luck =]|`|gDuDNeRcaa	you hit it off once...take a shot! thats what i would do. see what happens, because you don't want to spend another 13 months screwing your mind up with "what if"|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	Wait wait,do not approach that guy dude!!  You told that he hangs out with other gals, so you should know about his character pal!!|`|HRJkHuw4aa	yes you should call him, dont jump the gun. just play it by ear, keep it casual until you can figure out how you really feel about this guy and how he feels about you. its obvious you like him otherwise it wouldnt bother you that he is hanging out with another chic. Go out with the guy!!! If he hasnt asked you within the next week or so of talking to him then you ask him - stop being a chicken! good luck|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	I'd just start messaging him on myspace again, or continue texting him. If he asks you to call him this time, suggest that he call you. I mean, hey, it's only right. If he likes you, he will call you.|`|eu3Gi5BNaa	move on.|`|Y2sDswLBaa	Well you straight up rejected him twice....so im amazed he even wants to talk to you...but assuming that for some reason he does, ask yourself is you actualy want a relationship. if you are just gonna reject him again then dont even bother. thats just mean. but if you honestly think that you might say yes to him, then yes become his friend.|`|prMKOPKJaa	he sounds like a nice guy, but because you have blown him off so many times, he may end up hurting you to get back at you. Guys dont like rejection. You have gone beyond hard to get. Just be his friend|`|5r48jn7iaa	become his friend again. but the fact you rejected him2 times before he might not want to take a chance again.|`|RiLmN8Q2aa	I'm sorry babe, but I would drop him like a fly... He seems to me like he's a player..   I had a guy like that once... He would ONLY call me when his girls wasnt around.... Sorry babe, but move on..|`|mXO2TOUjaa	I would go for it, and while you are texting him ask him what his relationship is with the other girl. Don't leave yourself out in the cold|`|TWW5DGttaa	If I were you I would jump at the next chance to go out with him. His persistence impresses me and communicates he is not a guy just looking for some or a random girl. But since he has another hirl around I wouldn't look too anxious becuase now he might think you want him for his looks or something lol. Plus he may not feel desperate having another girl with him and may consider you as more of another option than the girl he's been pursuing for months. I would let him make the first moves, then jump at it. Don;t look like you want him way more than you did before but definitely don't turn him off. Remind him why he liked you so much to begin with by having fun and being yourself.|`|M0GoGVHXaa	Flirt with him and make sure he knows your interested..then he might ask you out for the third time! lol|`|6sQeFL8Waa	My opinion would be for you to become good friends with him again. Try to text him, do the same as he did, ask him to call you..   you should try to get closer to him, and drop a hint or two on the way.     Good luck =]
5agXk9ldaa	no not really|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	yea, I guess they dont understand that some people just want to  be themselves! Its good for you. You will probably find that when you do have a bf, you will have more successful relationships because you will know who you are and what you want from life. Good for you!!|`|NICEuXYgaa	no not at all.  everyone does there own thing at their own time.  my best friend of 20 years is 23 and still never had a serious relationship.  don't let anyone rush you|`|5r48jn7iaa	its not a weird thing...but all guys are different. some do some don't because they feel the same way.|`|4RiziMD0aa	i agree with that guy... my guy cousin told me the same thing... they have insecurity problems so if they know a girl is not ready it makes them go for her more.|`|yp8NtB0faa	No they don't.  I think guys would actually prefer a girl that hasnt had a boyfriend yet lol. but if they do, screw them.  They should understand that thats how you feel, and your just waiting for Mr. Right.|`|QXonMLisaa	yes|`|56LJzg3baa	not really - pretty normal in my opinion :)    just makes it seem mysterious as to why and then makes the guy pay more interest to you ;)|`|uQswOjy9aa	a nice guy wouldn't think that but there is some guys who are stupid not trying to be mean but its true.|`|bUmdkEnxaa	My answer NO|`|AA10529198	He was asking because he wants to hit that ! He wanted to know if there were any psychological or cultural barriers.  When you said "go with the flow" that was a green light..     Did he hit it that night ?|`|cq4ng6QLaa	I think you should tell him to slow things down.|`|385ee02fbc621fe7804bf246eb6a660eaa	No, at least I don't think so. I find people nowadays rush into early relationships at a very young age, but the thing is ..they don't realize they aren't mature enough for a serious relationship. Some people end up scarred with horrible experiences.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI,,,S.U.M.M,,,,,HONEY,,I DONT THINK SO CAUSE THERE R A LOT O F GUYS OUT THERE THAT HATE TO COMIT TO ANY GIRL,,,,HAVE FUN,,,IF YOUR HAPPY,,,THATS ALL THAT COUNTS,,,,PEACE|`|vHI9bgrAaa	no...it makes them chase.  cause then if you were like yeah im ready for a relationshuip he may back off...  answer mine...|`|Pkxu7FfMaa	not at all in fact it make them want to be in one|`|e6a23ac67889f43ee25e6ff968fea607aa	Dear... i appreciate wat u did ...frankness is really needed to maintain these relationships..It isnt wierd...Bt if he felt tat wierd then just throw out of r lyf ...If a guy cant understand wat u say then he isnt the guy gud 4 frndship...|`|YgZDXDgFaa	No, coz im the same as you... im 19 and never really had a boyfriend. It's not because im ugly or anything, i just don't know why i haven't had one.   It's cool to chill and you get used to be so independant.     At least we're not desperate, and that is a major turn off i think
0213803fc19fd10c5a6f0ddb8efc455eaa	Fighting and hitting people is not a resolution and your elders shame on you.  At least you recognise that it is a problem and looking for positive solutions, try and find out some interests that you like to meet new people that are kind and count to 10 before you do anything silly, you have a choice of how you behave and respond to situations. Write a list or vision board of the things you want to change for the whole of 2009, you can add to this as you recognise who you are and what makes you happy.  Try www.oprah.com she has lots of information on there that can help you to become the person you aspire to be.|`|TycEvdg0aa	I'll tell you to think of your house members just like your friends. You act mature infront of your friends in order for them to think you are just like them. Normal. You don't think of your relatives like your friends. They are much closer to you. You care if your friends feel bad but you don't care if your relatives feel bad because you are closer to them then you are to your friends. You hide your true personality from your friends but you don't hide it from your family. Besides 13 is the age where you start to be mature not end. You are maturing by the way. If your friends don't think you are immature then you aren't. this is the first step of maturing. By more or less than a year or 2 you would mature in not only your social life(which you seem to already have) but your family life as well.      Read this only when you are not satisfied with my answer  "I AM 15 AND STILL NOT MATURE"|`|dDDAbqqhaa	sorry, we can't help you with that...it's your problem and only you can deal with it|`|b3dKghjHaa	You already know what you do that isn't considered "mature." Now, make a conscious effort to stop doing that. Stop and think before reacting. Don't burn any bridges with your family, you will need them later.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Mature  This is really helpful :)|`|VBBrRGs2aa	Don't do any of those things,for starters,I'm 13 too and I know what you mean.Just think about your actions before you do it.|`|tJ6N1IyZaa	Just grow up a little bit more your in that age that doesn't give a damn about anyone but themselves. Your the only one that can help yourself...Don't hit people that love you just because they don't do what you want them to. You don't control them they live their own lives and don't need you hurting them to try and push yourself away from them. LOVE THEM DON'T HURT THEM|`|nIV0oAGNaa	I,m 13 going on 14 and am more mature then most 16 year olds that i know. I have a older brother but i learn not to fight with him as it caused me to become stressed and makes your parents stressed, Your Mom won,t be there forever so you should mind your Mom think about her for once, You hit your Grandma i am suprised you got away with that haven,t you heard of respecting your elders? Respect your Grandma as if she hadn,t had your Mom you wouldn,t of been in this world! plus she,s gone through alot of the things you will so respect her.  You hit your Brothers that,s something you shouldn,t be proud of they won,t be there forever remember some people wish they had siblings so count yourself lucky.  You are tearing yourself apart from them be kinder, nicer, smile, don,t hit, listen and don,t smart mouth!.  Put your Games consoles in your cupboard and leave them there and spend time with your family!.

We've been married 15 years and I'm going to stay in it.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Umm I plan on staying married? I don't think anyone goes into a marriage though expecting to get divorced . . .|`|j7l9gavRaa	i would love to get married and hopefully never be divorced|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I dont think anyone ever plans to marry just ot get divorced, i know i dont plan on getting divorced.

QVQdcmrgaa	hahahhahaa WHAT?? I can't believe he did that, call housing and get your room changed.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	That is so creepy... Shaving your legs.... Talk to the roommate and be honest and say how creepy that is. Was it a prank|`|cq4ng6QLaa	I think you should tell him hoe uncomfortable that was waking up to that i'm sure he'll understand.|`|7HwQi3Xsaa	talk to him. why do he did what he did.then tell him not to do again.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Personally I hate waking up to someone shaving my legs.
1kZenfZzaa	I couldn't tell you.  My husband never slept on the couch, I have never punished him for anything, he isn't a child or a criminal.  Maybe it's just a TV thing.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Don't count ME in that group!    "I" don't mind sleeping on the couch!    LOL!|`|SWxcuGlOaa	Chances are the guy paid the mortgage on the house so I'd tell her to piss off|`|SS1FFafRaa	It's not a punishment.  It's kind of like camping to us.|`|vEj7xoBraa	I think men should punish women that way.|`|j7l9gavRaa	i don't do that, i think it is like using sex as a weapon it's dumb and doesn't work    i have found that if i really want to punish my guy i stay right next to him in the bed and talk to him all night when he is tired haha that'll teach him not to be a jerk|`|OG4410bdaa	I've never done this  no matter how bad a fight gets, that bed is OURS therefore he has just as much right to be in it as I do    plus, if you make yourself physically distant by sleeping apart, then it becomes easier to grow emotionally distant when you are awake-  studies show that couples who sleep in the same bed can often "sync-up" so to speak, and share emotions, sometimes even share dreams    what I do when we are mad at eachother is I hold him even tighter  I tell him that's his punishment: he married me so now no matter how badly we piss each other off he is stuck with me, and holding him tighter in bed is my way of showing him that we're going to work through this fight whether he wants to or not, lol|`|dprURFLxaa	I don't punish him like that.  I spank him.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Ha!  I would never get away with it...if I'm that upset and don't want to sleep with him (which almost never happens...) he would tell me to go hit the couch...|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I don't know.  The arguement would be over a lot quicker if they both slept in the bed.|`|TWW5DGttaa	I don't think it was meant to be punishment, it's just somehow understood as that now. But I think the reason was that women cant sleep in the same bed with someone she is angry with it's like getting in a fight then cuddling up-it's not gonna happen. To men, sleeping in bad is just sleeping in bed, but to women, there is an intimacy factor present. The women are also not going to be the ones sleeping on the couch because they don't like the couch and in their minds the man is wrong so the couch is where they are sent.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	To me, it's no punishment at all.  She tosses and turns, snores and occasionally farts in her sleep.  I love the couch.  I get a good night's sleep.  Slept there last night and feel refreshed today.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	I have no clue.My husband and i may have a dissagreement here and there but no matter what is he always by my side when we go to bed.I couldnt sleep otherwise.|`|YOKJP1evaa	Ugh, that is SO old-fashioned.  I believe that women and men should stay up and fight then make amends.|`|FfLq56Yfaa	I think it's an "I'm mad at you, and don't want you near me" thing.  Sleeping together is a part of intimacy and if a woman is mad she doesn't want any part of it.  And/or couches tend to be less comfortable than a bed, so it's a physical punishment as well :P|`|oMIxJTO1aa	i dno i find it kind of dumb. and o does my girl.. haha|`|m7L9BX6haa	It's just a "I'm mad and don't want you near me" thing.  It doesn't work and it really only drives a wedge of resentment between the couple.|`|FP6JMvlTaa	so as not to smell their smelly gas|`|AA10036540	I usually sleep on the couch.      Most men won't go and sleep on the couch, so I leave and let him have the bed to feel lonely in, or whatever they do while in there alone.
LMRaSXFeaa	i think that it means that youve met the person a long time ago and fate put you together again.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	It means that there is one perfect match for every person. I am lucky enough to have already found mine and married him on Nov 8 last year!!!     I know a lot of people get confused and say "how can you think there is only one person for everyone"? I don't mean that you can't be happy if you don't find this one person. Each person also has a lot of people that they can easily be happy with. I just think there is that one "perfect" person for everyone.|`|G5t86Nvoaa	the term soul mate can have a lot of different meanings, you could find your soul mate as being the person who you are in love with and want to marry and grow old with,or it could be a best friend that you know will always be there|`|sspuxjyraa	It means that there is only one person in the entire world that God has matched you with, and the odds of finding this one person are like 1 in 3 billion, and you'll probably never meet because they probably live in China or India or Germany or Brazil anyway, and if you ever do happen to find them you'll probably not be attracted to them because they haven't showered in a while and you'll think this is gross so you'll probably never ever end up even saying hello, not that they could understand you anyway because they probably don't speak English.    So good luck finding that soulmate!
ByUS0k8waa	No you can keep your own name. If you get married and then want to divorce when you have changed your name but want your maiden name back you have to pay to get your maiden name back if you change it and then want it back. So as long as you keep your name when you get married you will not ever have to pay to get your maiden name back.|`|j7l9gavRaa	i have never heard of this then again i have never looked into it you should call your local courthouse and ask|`|MGDtjCK1aa	u got to. otherwise people are not going to think to highly of you. they are going to think that your not married or that you are just living with some one just in common law. now correct me if im wrong but in a religious society like america thats not well respected and it could cause you some problems.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Yeah, hummm... someone told you a bunch of lies.  You don't need to pay to keep your last name.|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Changing your last name is a matter of preference and unity, as much as any guy would love the flattery of the love of their lives changing their last name, most would understand if you chose not to. As for if it cost money to keep your name thats a lie, it doesnt, just an option in the paper work when you get married to keep it or not.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	That is absurd! I kept my last name; it doesn't cost anything.|`|VSb6S6muaa	it's not, my sister got married & didn't change her last name, she just kept the info the same on the marrige lisence.|`|gpqdfcSpaa	NO, you do not have to pay if you don't want to change your name.  Women do it all the time, but out of respect for your husband and your marriage maybe you would consider at least hypenating it.
SHRxkXPLaa	At this point, let him push you away. You don't need the problems of dealing with someone who is an alcoholic. If he gets treatment, cleans up, goes to AA, and demonstrates that he has a desire to stay sober, then it may be worth your time to pursue him. But while he's drunk, he's thinking more about his next drink than you, and though I don't know you, I'm sure you don't deserve that.|`|iktuXTQTaa	You can't help someone who doesn't want help.  Move on or you will be very sorry you didn't.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	That's who he is. He wants to spend his days incoherent and unhealthy - that's his choice. But remember, if that's how he is now, don't expect things to get much better as he gets older.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	cant you find a more respectable person to fall in love with,, you are acting silly|`|g2QUNwZzaa	you can either accept him as a drunk, or forget about him and wait til another guy comes around that you will love.    you can't change the way he is, you said you already tried, and he probably wouldn't be the same person sober anyway|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Let him drank.You see it as a problem he sees it as a calmer.Ask him what led him to drank.then you might understand him.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Move on. He loves his drink more than he loves you. If you've tried helping him and he doesn't want help, he's not going to change. Walk away or you will end up getting hurt in a situation like this. Tell him that you will be there for him only IF he gets help and cleans himself up. But until then you can't be with him. As long as you stick around, he doesn't think he needs to get help and he won't change. You are being an enabler|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Wow.  What a winner.  You want a relationship with an alcoholic.  I hope this works out really well for you.|`|rJq8TxHGaa	This reminds me of the song by Evanescence - Call Me When You're Sober. Listen to it, it'll make you feel better! Haha.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEoP43Pv5...|`|aGno0HAwaa	Well there is nothing you can do other than explaining him how bad drunk is, if he dosen't listens to you then you should leave him. You can't go suicide because he won't stop being drunk right? Good luck and choice is yours.|`|RAiBtbMLaa	well.. thats who he is. trust me.. ive tried to change people. its not gonna happen. :/|`|l04kUKtHaa	Chic, why the heck would you want to be loved back by a drunk?

If you are seeing that he is pushing you away when you try to help, why would you want to be around him? You deserve to be treated with far more respect than what some drunk is willing to give you. And don't say you'd give your life for anyone,  would you want to be beaten by a drunk and take it till you came to your death because you love him that much? The more he drinks the more abusive they become. There are other guys who are fun, have great personalities and don't get drunk. You should love and respect yourself for the person you are so that others can treat you with the same respect you give to yourself.|`|YOAzuTR4aa	sober living!!!|`|9CLEuikhaa	Then leave him no one needs to be around someone drunk all the time! It hurts both of you if he won't get help.|`|Cn2UBsCaaa	tell him to stop drinkin then!|`|AA10251806	let him go now, you don't want that all through your life, never gets better.|`|lS32BUy8aa	He's Just not that into you!!

Peace!|`|fyKydb6Iaa	you can not help a drunk until he admits there is a problem, stay away from him it will lead to a life of sadness and regret   If he can't take care of himself how can he take care of you ?|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	if he cant stop then it will be problems in the future between you two. if you think he feels the same way then you should tell him he has to slow down or quit. once he slows down and then trys to drink a lot again remind him how it feels when he wakes up the next morning. very sluggish and hung over. its a feeling you hate and makes you think twice about drinking again or at least slowing down. and you have to consider the problems that come behind drunks that dont remember anything when they sober up.|`|afFUs27kaa	if he doenst want to help himself, what you say wont matter. he needs to hit rock bottom then work back up.  I think you just like the bad boy image this brings but alcoholism is an addiciton and in a way a mental health problem that he will have to live with even if he does give up drinking.  its no good going into a relationship if one person needs help that much and cant cope in a normal society (drunks cant)|`|Lnwi0ULuaa	it's not worth it if he's always drunk. problems would only get worse in a relationship. he has to fix it himself. if he doesn't want to stop drinking there nothing you can do. just hope that someday he realizes what you have tried to do and realize he has a problem.|`|t0O71Olzaa	if you want a feel good answer, then don't ask. the truth hurts. sorry.   but grow up. your not in love, just lust. you can not change him. he will hate it and you.

If he wont get the help from you he wont get it from no one else. This is one of (possibly) many things you will have to consider if you really want to be with this person. So it's something to think about.|`|EY2ixfZzaa	Jessica Jessica Jessica, what kind of life will you have if you stay with him not a very good one, you already said when you try to talk to him he pushes you away well then he already picked whats more important you or drinking... So If you want to live that kind of life stay but if not walk away show him you are damn serious about his drinking maybe that will wake him up and he will say "she is really serious about this' and ask for help, until then stay away that  the best thing you can do for this guy! if you stay Jessica your life will be a living hell no one needs to be in a life with a drunk it is not fun at all! so please walk away and live a good life if he see's you are serious he will wake up if not well then let him be! it is him that wants that life!

cIBqQ0QEaa	I suggest moving out to college. Even though the economy is not doing so well at the moment, you can move onto campus and use scholarships and grants to pay the room and board. I would suggest in this economic time to def go for law enforcement though. Cosmetology is really a hit and miss type of profession. While everyone has to get their hair cut, not everyone has to pay a hefty amount of money to do so. Maybe do cosmetology on the side so if you ever decide to revert back you also have that schooling.
iPNOVR6Gaa	If you don't want him laying on top of you, tell him to get off.  If you don't want to hold his hand, don't.  By putting up with those things, you are continuing a pattern you have that is ultimately counterproductive.  Your pattern is to behave in a manner inconsistent with your feelings.  That's bad.  From the beginning of your relationship, you have tolerated behavior you didn't want to tolerate.  It is high time you stopped that.  Tell your husband what you need from him, and make it absolutely clear that you will tolerate nothing less.  You need, in the worst possible way, to become assertive in this relationship.|`|asX2hxFXaa	You only have one life.  You decide whether there should be a better way to spend it.    I respect your views about your vows and divorce, but I personally refuse to believe God gave you the gift of life so you could be miserable.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Wow...  I felt like I was reading my own story from back in my 20's here. I don't know what to tell you exactly. I stayed in my marriage for 16yrs. I didn't love him. He didn't love me. Was it right to stay for the children & because of belief in the vows we took?  No, Not really. I am 40yrs old - divorced for 4 yrs. My 2 children are in their mid to late teens. It wasn't easy when I chose to get out & move on. And it's taken me a great deal of time to "get it together". All I know is that single life at this age, sucks! When I look back, I wish I would have done it sooner. There was ssssooo much damage done by staying in a loveless marriage. What you both owe to your children is for them to see you Happy!  So, maybe give your marriage another shot, by telling your husband, "look we need to talk". And lay it out there that you know he isn't any more happier than you are. If he wants out, he can go. If he wants to give it one more try, then have him tell you what his expectations are of you & you listen... take it in & think about it. The next day, you get to tell him your expectations... Then on the 3rd day, you talk about the expectations your relationship requires. Once it's all laid out on the table, together you can decide if it's worth it or not...|`|YEV9D8Jvaa	http://www.amazon.com/Women-Who-Love-Too...  You need help. You answered your own question.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Good God,    Get out while you still have a nice pair of **** that might attract somethng beside the piece of crap you are married to    And do it now...|`|8txWayVnaa	Anything is possible if you both want it work badly enough.  But on the other hand, there's an R. Kelly song that says it all:  "When a woman's fed up, there ain't nothing you can do about it. . . ."    Hang in there until you finish school, sweetie.  You have two young children to support, and last time I checked, being a stay-at-home mom doesn't pay much.|`|x5HMQgQyaa	I believe the point of no return indicates there is no returning.    I'm sorry to say it hun, but very very few men ever change. I would make the decision to protect my own children, and get the heck out of dodge.|`|8ExcR9SZaa	That is such a difficult situation and my heart truly goes out to you. It is possible however to change things. First think back to the reasons you married him in the first place. Also how much do you know about his past? He may have been hurt in the past of brought up in a family that isn't big on showing their emotions and thus lives by what he knows. Another thing you can do is examine yourself. Think of things that you may be able to work on and improve them. Ask your husband if he sees anything in you that may need some tuning up. Then ask him if you could be honest with him in the same way. I know it's extremely difficult but be patient and just continue to be loving person that you seem to be. Suggest counseling, it seems like now he may be open to it. Good luck with everything and remember. Love endures all things.|`|7b329de1125da97b2b85ba98f7bff76faa	What about telling him "you have needs and I have mine"?it is a give and take thing.If he wants attention/Love from you he needs to give you what you need.Perhaps be more specific? "I want to have---" etc.  If he dismisses Your thoughts and feelings..then I would set some boundaries and really think about your next step.Good Luck|`|29hcn9JRaa	What does your age have to do with this? When a person claims their still young, typically it insinuates that their is still plenty of time for future relationships? Which is o.k if your already divorced, however your still very much a part of the marriage. My advise is to do what ever it is your going to do, it sounds as if you are bitter towards your husband, you sound like your respect for him is minimal, and you also appear to have zero desire to move forward to make things work, and their is no one on this site, or anywhere else in this world that will change how you feel about all your doubts and poor attitude towards this marriage, only you can make positive changes. Holding onto a marriage merely on account of your feelings about divorce is simply you trying to justify not leaving, it is time to be true to yourself and accept responsibility for your thoughts and feelings.|`|TjcPVFciaa	If you are unhappy, you are unhappy.  You shouldn't be in a relationship that doesn't work, regardless of how you feel about divorce.      It is much better for kids to be raised by parents who are each happy in their own separate homes than one unhappy home.      Divorce is not a sign of failure, it just means that the circumstances have changed and it isn't something you can live with anymore.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You married a man, not a vow.  Just as if you leased an apartment under terms that water and electricity will be provided, rent paid on monthly basis and so on.  You leased the apartment not the contract.  If it turns out the apartment has no water, no electricity and rent required every two weeks instead of monthly, would you stay in the apartment?.    Relationship is the same.  You husband is in breach of his vows, he is the perfect example of an abusive person and you must not waste your life and peace with him.   God never said you have to stand abuse, neglect and lack of love from your spouse.   God wants you to be happy.  Do it God's way.    Divorce the bastard, forgive  him, pray for him and move on with your life to give your children a loving home.   When children are raised in this type of home, they grow up thinking abuse and lack of caring is normal living and you do not want them to turn out like their father.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Not possible sorry .... When they cheat ...its over ... Instead of gettin out of dodge ... take the dodge and KICK him out ! Get the education first so you can take care of the kids!
FUQ3nayqaa	Quite honestly if that's something that is important to you and not very important to him than maybe its time to move on.  I've made compromises in past relationships (things that were important to me and not her, stuff like this) and the relationship always went sour because i tried to change who I was.  Dont change who you are, what you want is not bad and many guys appreciate that too.|`|mKIA6V4Saa	Tell him I told him to take his hugs and kisses like a man.|`|X1YVUA5oaa	Tell him I said he's a little boy and if he really liked you and cared about you he would give you some hugs and kisses. He needs to man up or it's time to dump him. Some guys are more romantic and stuff than others, if he isn't, you two probably aren't good together.|`|SweWC8p1aa	i bet you if you didnt do that, he would be mad too. either way guys never have 100% what they want.. So just show your love because why hind your feelings?|`|j9vmfa90aa	Find a new boyfriend... I would kill for a girl like you..  :)|`|8xDSKf3Maa	it is wrong if you do it to much but you need to do it every now and then.|`|5r48jn7iaa	you have to tell him that, cause there's really no way you can stop yourself.|`|xNMPvgFhaa	If the hugs are not excessive, I wonder why your bf gets mad with it..    Go join some classes or clubs, try to take more activities so you won't miss/contact him too much, and when he sees you, I'd bet he would love your hugs!    If he's still not happy with it, then you just have to find someone else who would be happy with all your attentions.     Good luck!
AA11336623	Depends how their relationship is. If the couples marriage is solid, then a hubby would not even consider such an act. But if the couple is have difficulty, I am sure the idea would arise.|`|ydclPOBLaa	a real man and husband wouldnt.. but how many of those are out there.. men  tend to think with the wrong head...|`|qAMZ9Jozaa	I would have 20 years ago but not since I grew up.|`|rsb6rEouaa	No, I have had the chance and turned it down. I respect my wife to much for a quick piece of A$$. Plus i think the guilt would kill me.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Better yet I was in Asia for 10 days on business and had many, many chances to cheat and didn't.      She never would have found out, but I would have known.  And I would have felt bad.    PS.  Over the years we have had plenty of conflict over sex, different drive levels but I know she loves me and physically she makes an effort to give me great *** even sometimes when I know she doesn't want to.      If my wife was like some of these other guys say their wives are I would have left long ago....|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I'm sure you will find many who will say yes, but it has nothing to do with not getting caught, people that cheat on their spouses really do not care if they get caught, because they have no respect for them anyway.  Because if they did, they would not be cheating in the first place.|`|AA10248966	No and I did not cheat when I had opportunities. My vows were more important that a quick fling. However, it did not stop my ex from doing just what you describe, and that is why I have zero to do with her ever and forever now.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	why not .. she wont know will she ..|`|sMssDP1Xaa	No, because I've had plenty of opportunities to cheat and never did because I knew I had to look myself in the mirror.  The ex did end up cheating on me though, that's why she's the ex now.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	yes, and i do|`|j7l9gavRaa	i would hope they wouldn't because i wouldn't do that to my man but you never know|`|YEV9D8Jvaa	you never get away with it. You always have your memories.|`|6ypXMb1jaa	I think for most men that question is a NO BRAINER.    Meaning yes, they would cheat. Maybe they wouldn't feel good about it, but I think most men take their lives and wives for granted.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I love my wife to much to cheat. I'll beat myself up for the rest of my life if i did. But one good thing i can never see myself doing that|`|RHux2Fmnaa	Sorry, I know you asked men, but I know for a fact that 99.9% of men would cheat and will cheat even if they risk getting caught...I know, sad.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	my husband is always gone for a week or more at a time and i never even think of cheating.

First, the man knows it - and that will profoundly change his marriage.  So even if she never finds out, she won't like how the relationship is souring as a result of what he knows.    Second, God knows it - and karma is a beeyach, if you know what I mean.    So there is no such thing as getting away with an affair.  It just can't happen.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Yes.  I'm a chick though.|`|Apm88mVTaa	There is one woman on this earth that if I was married to the answer would be "no".  All others, "yes".

I have one fav...    "being grateful for everything we have is the first key to happiness"    Ana ^^
b5ecvoTnaa	fellow sister here, girl! it's definitely hard since you've probably care about the guy and honestly girl, I'd be the same as you! I'm a teenager myself, so I know how you feel. If he continues to pressure you, you've gotta tell him why it makes you so uncomfortable. If he keeps going on about it and how everybody "sins," ask him if he calls himself a Christian. If he says yes, ask him if he believes every part of the Bible and what it says. If he again says yes, then go to this passage: 1 Samuel 15:22 "But Samuel replied, 'Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the Lord? To obey is better than to sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams."    To understand this passage, you have to look at the context. Isreal was sinning and sinning, but like your boy friend, they were saying 'oh as long as we ask for forgiveness and sacrifice the animals, God will be ok with it.' So, God told them (this is in my own words, of course) "Are you kidding me? That's not what I want! I want you guys to be like me! not to sin! I'm asking you not to sin! I want it so much more for you guys just to obey me. Not just continue to kill these animals whenever you sin! I mean, how selfish is that?"    So, girl, talk to him about this passage. If this doesn't make him stop, I really suggest the two of you take a break. Men are usually stronger, and you guys are 'yoked together,' and you don't want him (I don't know who is the stronger one in the relationship) pulling you over to the wrong side. I'm glad you're resisting temptation! I'll keep you in my prayers, my sister and friend! May God bless and stay with you.|`|ee132737d0e2aeb1472848f439feaf8aaa	You are very correct on the fact that your scared because you are 16 and could become pregnant. Thats a very natural fear. Look no one has the right to pressure you to do anything. He shouldnt judge you because your not a virgin and expect sex. I think you felt guilty about it in the first place wich probably ment you werent ready and were not sure in the first place. Now you decided to start over and keep your self from having sex. Perfectly normal. If you explained all your feelings towards your decision than he should respect you. Now, if its true that he LOVES YOU then he should understand that its making you crazy thinking about this and that your hurting from it deeply. If he cant and ignores it do you really think he cares about you alot? Hes mainly thinking about himself and his hormones. As your boyfriend and someone who loves you his job is to understand you.|`|ZJohgu1saa	Hey u sound like a respectful girl who obviously thinks long term. yeh even though people take precautions u may still get pregnant. If ur worried about that then stick to ur decision, and if he cant handle it tell him to go elsewhere. U deserve much better, and definately a guy who will understand u, and not tell u they will cheat!! leave him again and for good this time. hes not worth it..|`|AA10529198	Just tell him that if he cheats, you WILL have sex, but with his best friend and not him.  That will buy you a few days.|`|PF9E2P4Waa	Don't be pressured by your boyfriend if he really loved you he wouldn't try to pressure you. You know whats best for yourself !!!     Good Luck|`|8X0lmhIQaa	I don't think you need to be christian to answer this as the advice is obvious. Get rid of him. He sounds like a selfish idiot. If he is prepared to cheat on you just for sex then he doesn't love you, he only wants to use you.|`|7dAh8B3haa	wow!!! if he is gunna be like that u dont need him. im a teen mom myself, and ts hard. but he is the one being selfish and if he cant respect your wishes then he really doesnt care or respect you or your body.|`|4cdq26oraa	Religion aside, you should do whatever YOU feel is best for you. If you don't want to do anything until you are married, then don't. Don't ever let someone pressure/blackmail you into doing something you don't want to. He's not worth anything if he isn't understanding about this and respect you for your decision.  Dump him and consider yourself lucky, as I'm sure there are more things he'd guilt/pressure you into doing down the road.|`|2bb1214a282e2cfeed0adeb41e0bcf6eaa	If he's trying to pressure you when you dont want to have sex then he obviously doesn't respect you enough, but the fact that he actually said he will cheat on you if you dont do it, well that just shows how selfish and pathetic he is, dump him and find someone who DOES care about you and respects what you want to do.|`|InGWARz9aa	You need to part company lol x|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	If you are uncomfortable with sex don't do it, if it's only the concerns of becoming pregnant see your doctor about the pill, sex is a part of life but only if your happy to have sex, do not be pressured into something your not happy with, your rights are to reject sexual advances if you wish for whatever reason you wish and for no reason if you want, your boyfriend might need sex more than you and it is his right to seek sex elsewhere, if you are not happy with this it might be time to find other partners and move on.|`|eLhWgghwaa	Leave him... he sounds like a complete git. He doesn't respect you and he doesn't love you! Ditch him|`|AtJgXB59aa	if you don't want to don't after you you give it up hes gonna leave so just break up with him because he is a loser and you don't need him|`|AA11735109	well i'm not a Christian but i'm answering this anyway (hope i'm not offending you); but yea he is not at all bothered about you and he wants you just for the sex, he does not love you for sure. don't do it if you don't want to, as simple as that, and if he can't take it, rid him....good luck!|`|HvOuJjDyaa	There is no way your boyfriend should be pressuring you like that, particularly if you are just 16, whether you are Christian or not. If you aren't happy with the situation, you shouldn't do it and if your boyfriend can't accept that then -- difficult as it may be -- I think you should move on as it just shows he isn't considering how you feel. It doesn't matter whether he agrees with you or not, and you shouldn't have to explain yourself to him because you aren't being unreasonable, you are making a choice for yourself. You could give him an ultimatum and tell him either stop pressuring you or you are leaving him.    With regard to sex getting you pregnant, this would only happen if you didn't use contraception which you should totally always do unless you are trying for a baby, so that's not really the issue -- it's whether you want to or not. If you are worryied about having a 'weak' moment, then make sure you always carry contraception with you.    Hope this is helpful - you have a whole lot of life ahead of you at your age so try not to let it get you down too much.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	You dont want to have sex because  of your beliefs.  Fair enough.  If your boyfriend is pressuring you to have sex with him and you dont want to, which you dont then you need to sever all contact with him.  He is not for you.|`|0TTZERJmaa	why are you getting involved with this guy if you dont feel this way about him.     just let him go he dosent care about you all he wants is sex dont screw upi your life find a nice guy that respects you and lets you make the decisions.    good luck and play safe xx|`|E14cuDlZaa	Well, I honestly think that by reading your story, He does not deserve you. If you don't want to have sex with him that is perfectly alright. Maybe he is not the right one for you. I would advise someone else.  If he constantly says he'll leave you and cheat on you just to get sex from someone else, then he's not the right one. Think about it.  Good Luck.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Whether you or your boyfriend are Christan's or not or if you are virgin or not is irrelevant to this. If you do now want to have sex yet then you don't and it is your decision. From your description he sounds like a bit of a selfish git and I think you would be better of finding a nice boy friend. If you can do that judge him on his personality not on some religious belief he may or may not have
5r48jn7iaa	maybe its her friends kid, alot of people dont like kids.|`|d1wXxd9paa	You are far from being a bad person.  How you react and what you do and don't like is what makes you an individual who has a personality.  If you feel that this is really interfering with your life and relationships talk to you wife.  Express your feelings and don't be afraid to.  Take it to the next level if its making you really insecure and talk to your doctor.  Hope this Helps!!  Just remember your not a bad person|`|hwMyBb8naa	this is one of the complex query i have seen so far........    i think you are confused.... i can figure out from your query,    pls dont get annoyed... what is your problem   you are not comfortable with babies or people with babies???    sit lonely think as many times... what is exactly disturbing you.....|`|WFP46Ek9aa	email me ... rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com|`|0udjgaoBaa	Have you ever had a bad experience with any babies?

It just seems silly to me to put it on, only to have it back off in under 60 seconds.|`|aXYiOskmaa	perhaps if instead of just buying it and expecting her to wear it, you told her that it looks nice on her and that sometimes you'd like to liven up your sex life, she might be more open to it. believe me, just handing it to her and expecting things is just like saying "i'm horny, lets have sex now"|`|4YZBPfhRaa	hahaha yeahh your definitely NOT being blunt enough..      i used to for my ex.... and he pretty much told me i like have to haha (in a joking way)      hahahahaha omg goood luck|`|j7l9gavRaa	i like to wear lingerie sometimes for my man because it makes me feel sexy he never asks for it nor does he really get MORE excited when i do put it on|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Yes, I do wear it.

I like to wear comfortable nighties to bed except during winter when it is to cold out. On date night I always make sure im wearing a nice thong and brabut any other tiem it is comfort comfort comfort. It is about making him happy and making yourself happy. if you nto comfortble in the lingerie your not going ot wear it, maybe she is self concious about it. try wearing it for a laugh and then maybe she will wear it. i hate when i find my husband being funny by wearing my lingerie it jsut isnt the same after that.|`|89TgOjXpaa	instead of being nice just be blunt and to the point tell her to get her @ss in the lingerie|`|T3neqEXqaa	okay.  If I was able to get lingerie I would wear it for my other.  I think the only thing that would stop me is the fact that i don't like my body. And He tells me there is nothing wrong with it. and that i am fine.    And...I would do it if i wanted to. If i wasn't comfortable enough..I would let him know and he would repspect me.    SO i think that maybe she is feeling something that she isn't telling you.  I would confront her about it.|`|Uuc3PgDnaa	if she asked you to wear a pvc suit and a gimp mask but you did not want to would you be happy , think about it|`|i15KoiJhaa	Typically don't wear "Traditional Lingerie" the reason being...     OMG some of the stuff they have out there... the garters, the snaps, the adjustable cups... LOL I could go on and on... by they time you get all this stuff hooked, snapped, adjusted... it isn't all that comfortable, in fact some of it is downright scratchy!    However... more non-traditional lingerie I'm totally down for and so is my Hubby... some sexy Victoria Secret boy short panties with a sexy cami... waaaayyy more comfy, totally sexy, nothing scratching, riding up and a lot easier taking off then my Hubby fumbling around with the 25 hooks to undo....     Still, I think it's sweet that you opened the account and took her shopping at VS... but maybe it is the type of lingerie you're looking at or purchasing that is stopping her from really wanting to put it on? How about some more non-traditional lingerie for her?|`|JaNE0HKyaa	I wear it sometimes just to spice things up. No he never has to ask me to. Although he go nuts when I do it.|`|wlupqLrBaa	To be completely honest, if she went with you to buy it then she's obviously into wearing it. The fact that she hasn't worn them as yet could be that she feels she will be putting herself on show and needs more time to pluck up the courage and gain confidence. On the other hand, do you dress up for her? Do you satisfy her needs?, if you do she will be more than willing to return the favour. Women need more than just 'my man wants me to wear them' Tell her why you want to see her sexy a** in those items lol x    Hope this helps!

8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	I'm going to make a few honest statements:    1) People choose their company for reasons.     2) Nonusers are fearful of the lifestyle and consequences of users so it's not the norm for an adult nonuser to associate on a personal basis with hard core users. Meth is considered hard core and the lifestyle around it is dangerous.     3) A nonuser with three children would NEVER associate with meth heads unless there was a personal need to do so. Why? Getting caught at the wrong place at the wrong time could jeopardize her rights to her children. NO ONE would risk losing their kids simply because they want to hang out with the girls.     4) Loneliness is a main reason why some people take drugs.    I hope I've helped. Best of luck.|`|iufAPDeWaa	If she continues hanging out with those type of people it will definately ruin you guys relationship. You just have to let her know that she needs to let them go and stress how serious of an issue this is. She should be willing to for the sake of the relationship if she cherish's it enough. I'm pretty sure she knows that she shouldn't be hanging around them anyway. Because say if she continues too and down the road it ruins you alls relationship somehow, trust that she'll be telling herself how stupid she was, and how she knew she should have listened and left them alone. Sometimes people have to learn the hard way. But it shouldn't take all of that for her. Talk to her!!
afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I think it is obvoius they have been throug ha lot but i htink any couple who are willing to work at it can make it. they married young so they missed out on youth and tried some things that were bad choices for most couples but they can work through it as long as the set boundaries.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Wow...And I thought Sodom was burned...|`|aiDV9FgGaa	No. There are inherent trust issues and immaturity. To want to have the cake and eat it too, so to speak.    They will not make it much beyond another year or two.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Since they seem to be tolerating the other person having sex with others, there's a chance it will last. It sure wouldn't be for everyone but there are some who would put up with it. If it works for you and your husband, good for you. To each his/her own. I couldn't put up with it though.|`|AA10248966	It is ALL about coming to agreement. Obviously they have.    two drug addicts can stay together For 50 years, while two Harvard law   school grads who are married only 6 months can look at each other and decide the marriage is over.    It is what people agree to and that is all there is.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Sounds pretty confusing and pretty messed up.I dont think it will last.They are both cheaters and are looking for something else that they havent found yet.Til they both find what they want they will continue to cheat.Just get divorced and live the single life.
tvK1xjzkaa	I think both cheat the same. Women emotional affairs and men for sexual affairs..|`|S2J3zWgiaa	Girls...they may not cheat at first so they wait until they until they gain the dude's trust. If girls acted right it would be a less conviction rate too...    money+hoes=crime|`|C2Fh3pphaa	both it has noting 2 do with gender . people are gonaa do what ever they want .|`|dfe9S3Raaa	i think it would be men...cuz men or more based on visual...and physical touch...its much easier to get a man then a woman. I'm a man by the way so there is no bias.|`|cdjLVZHraa	I think you would have to define your terms.  By cheat do you mean having a physical relationship with someone other that your mate?    Men tend to have more of the physical type cheating relationships, but women tend to have the more emotional cheating relationships.     I think both men and women are prone to cheating - because relationships are hard work and people are naturally lazy.|`|hl9OFIIKaa	MEN>>>>>>>>>>|`|1EwbKkKCaa	Honestly women. I think that women do it more but men get caught more.|`|63oSbqZlaa	Men, because women are too busy working and taking care of children all day. Then at night, after putting in all those hours each day, who has the energy?|`|JAEeotdKaa	i think Both|`|woPLfLQbaa	My thought on this is men are still the top cheaters however women are quickly creeping up. I believe this is because women have had this behavior happen on them many times in the past and men actually made them feel they were the ones entitled to the behavior. Which means women have finally realized their own strenghts and will follow the similiar behavior.|`|4gEU73sAaa	I think it would be 50/50.|`|4cdq26oraa	I've heard of a few in the past, but I question their validity. You're asking someone who's already being dishonest in cheating to honestly answer a question about whether they are cheating?  Probably about as accurate as the survey asking people if they are wanted criminals. Basic answer, both sexes cheat. It takes two to tango, so unless all the guys are cheating with the same woman . . . . I'd say it's pretty close to the same. But that's just my opinion.|`|ez5BjZdRaa	i think its more of women now a days. but its close to even. Because women are becoming all progressive and trying to be all independant.|`|oojO4WAraa	Men cheat more based on my observations and personal experience.  Men are just bigger whores than women.|`|IA5SuFkdaa	men b/c in most cases its the boyfriends and husbands who cheat they dont care but women can stay faithful|`|nrnVqh7iaa	I think it would be women....|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	I think the answer should be equal  - 50/50, cause it takes 2 to tango.  Even if a woman is not attached, and she knows the man is married, she is cheating..  lowering herself to try a take another woman's husband.  So she would be a thief and a cheat.|`|AA11988604	There have been several studies that try to get to this information.  All the ones I have read have men cheating more than women, but most people are surprised that as many women cheat as the studies show.  There is a difficulty in this sort of thing with accurate reporting.  There may be traits more common in one gender than the other that affect accurate reporting, which can skew the data.    But when you combine the survey results over a range of surveys that ask the question in various ways and under various circumstances, and compare that to the observed behavior under the prevailing theories of evolution and human behavior, it would seem that men have a stronger biological urge to spread their genetics broadly, and that collides with social mores to the result of more cheating in men.
VpCtXEMGaa	I didn't marry my first love. But I did marry my last and best love. :)|`|I3V7hE32aa	Nope!|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I married my first love. I started dating him when I was 15, on and off for a year, and then consistently from when i was 16. We got married when i was 19, and now we  will be married 6 years this May, and I have never been happier. I couldn't imagine my life without him!|`|itbkP9HGaa	No, nobody of my acquaintance did.  I know there are people out there who did, but I don't know any of them!  My friends, family, and myself dated for a few years before settling down with the right person.  I was 25 when I got married.|`|AA11961524	I did not marry my first love.It did not work out.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Yes, but he had kept hidden from me his bi-polar disorder, which was mild until he reached his early 30's when it hit full force, and after wards it was a struggle, not so much with the bi-polar, but his complete irresponsibility with it.....after 22 years the marriage ended.    I am now happily married to my 'soul mate', something I never believed existed until I met him....good luck|`|cq4ng6QLaa	No i married my second because your first love's turn out to just be your bestfriend. im married with three children a dog named skipper and i live in atlana. Im soo happi!|`|8zyu6FWpaa	No, I didn't.  But I'm getting married in April to my best friend, so it's like having a first love all over again.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I did but he wasn't my only love.  I was 15 when we started dating.  He was my high school sweetheart.  But college was not optional for either of us.  He went away to his college and I went away to mine.  As they were several hours apart, neither of us thought we should have a LDR trying to drive that far every weekend.    We broke up, dating others through college, and coincidentally (or fate) we were both single when I graduated.  We got back together and got married 2 years afterwards.  I was 24, he was 26 (but we were both about a month from being 25/27) when we got married.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	My husband is not my first love (but he is the best one!).  My sister didn't marry her first love, but both of my brothers married their first loves.  Of my group of girlfriends, two married their first loves, three did not.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Yep and I'm so glad I did : )|`|AA11603468	Nope.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I recently watched a man destroy himself (he has drunk himself to the point of needing a liver transplant) after his one and only first love since he was 13, left him after 20+ years of marriage...  so sad, but it doesn't always work.  I actually know very few people that it has worked with.  Actually, I know of one elderly couple and that's it.    That said, most of my high school relationships, in hindsight, were not very healthy and I should've taken that time in my life for self-discovery, but I didn't.  I am now 28 almost 29 years old and engaged to my college sweetheart.  We've been together since we were both 19.  I think waiting for marriage is incredibly smart since you learn to work through the many struggles of life before getting a binding legal document.      I think if you want to marry your high school sweetheart, do so after you have experienced college (preferably at different schools).  Then make sure you both have full time jobs so you can support yourselves.  If you can make it through that roller coaster time in life, you can make it through anything!|`|Xp2De933aa	no i didn't marry my "first love" and I am so glad that I didn't. I am marrying my soul mate on may 9 2009 and I couldn't be happier!|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	No, thank God!!  I'm getting married in September, and I am very glad that I didn't marry my high school sweetheart, or even my college sweetheart, because I feel that I needed to experience a few different people before I found the one I was meant to be with all along.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	No.  My first love broke my heart . . . by cheating.|`|YEV9D8Jvaa	Nope. She wouldn't have me but that was fifth grade.|`|AA12270223	yes, we meet and became great friends when we were 11 years old...started dating at 16...got engaged at 18...married at 19 almost 20...have been happliy married for 7 months.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Nope.

CSWHwlzvaa	I think it was really good|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	You were asking for a little too much info in this initial email. Kinda sounds like you want to know everything about her all at once, when in actuality you've never even spoken to her yet. How do you know you'd find her interesting in a regular conversation? Also, you could've been a little more conscientious of spelling and grammar. Women appreciate an intelligent man, and if you went to school you should be showcasing that skill.|`|71vWjc8Qaa	I think what you wrote is great, I think you may have just wrote it for the wrong girl. I would be very happy if I got something like what you wrote to her....  You sound like a very nice guy!|`|WZa6GhS3aa	That was perfect.  It explains everything they'd need to know in limited sentences  Well you ll have to be sure that they are like that if they have similar interests :)  sounds good though|`|rMeuCOtLaa	no it wasnt . . . id sure write back . .  u sound like a reaaly nice person u told her some background and then wat u wanted which is good so no i think u put it in a lovely nice way x =]|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	She may not know what your talking about with all the blanks,  ;o) lol jk    sounds fine|`|fHNOiZP0aa	It sounds...canned.  In other words, it's very predictable and blah sounding.  But that's just me.  Maybe she's the type of girl that likes the things you mentioned.  From this point of view though, you're mentioning tailgating and football watching to a girl who's traveled to Europe.  If that was something she mentioned in her profile, you could have spoken more about travel to entice her a bit.      "Tired of the whole party scene" is cliche.  Anyone on a dating site is tired of the whole party scene.  You probably shouldn't use the word, "commitment" in your first letter either    The last sentence was probably your best effort.      Hopefully I didn't come across as rude or mean, just trying to give some constructive criticism.|`|7lWMdR1Xaa	You did great, go get'er tiger. ^.~|`|sjJSjtynaa	It was really really good. You didnt just say flat out YOURE HOT or something stupid like that.
VmQBhY6iaa	Why do you care if he gets in trouble? I really hope he does for being such a di*k! If he was ordered by court to pay child support and he hasn't theres is a problem,maybe he already has his driver license suspended and you don't know(my son's father has a suspended lic because of non-payment of CS,and still drives)theres also the fact ur son is in school,he(ur ex) either have to take him(and pay for it) or he'll get in trouble since he's not thinking of the benefit of the kid.....  File for custody arrangements...make sure u get full legal custody! and shared physical custody.when you go to court take every little prove you have of how ur son's father is not involve in ur son's life,that not because one day he has the rights.Go to his school and ask them for all the recipes of the payments you done,and take everything you can...He(ur ex) has right to your son,but it has to be the benefit of the kid too,so if he's gonna be with your ex but he's(the father) is not taking him to school then that dont benefits the kid at all!    This web site has a lot of answer about custody and stuff like that   http://www.womansdivorce.com/      Good luck!!|`|Uuc3PgDnaa	the thing is have you always allowed your ex access, if not then i do not blame him , it is immaterial that he has no money or car , he is the father and is entitled to see him, i personally think if you have brought him up he should live with you but should see his father as often as possible, he is wrong to keep him from school and a judge will definitely take this into consideration, 9 times out of 10 you will get custody but access will be granted , you should stop downing your child's father as he was obviously good enough for you at one time and did after all give you the son that you love ,in your letter you sound very materialistic and vindictive to your ex , if you go to court with this attitude it will count against you, i know i sound harsh but having been through a similar action(it cost me my house, car and thousands of pounds) it would not be helpful to tip toe around the issue, i hope for your sons sake things can be resolved to his benefit, good luck|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Unfortunately since neither of you has court appointed custody, there will be no legal charges.  If you happen to see him out with the child you have every right to take him and keep him.    He will be in more trouble for not paying the court ordered child support.      School isn't going to be an issue either since it is not required at that age.      If your child has any medical appointments send receipt requested mail, if he does not show for the appointments and you can prove it, it will not help his case if he counter claims for custody.|`|AA10248966	FBI: Kidnapping charges immediately.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	talk to the teachers. the ymight be able to help because if your son is not going to school then they might make his dad take him|`|UaSb84BOaa	First, did you have any sort of visitation plan in place before filing for custody? I'm assuming not if the police could not help you. They can't do anything if nothing formal was arranged. However, when you go to court, the judge will take a look at your child support order and it maybe in your favor for getting your son back.   Prepare for this court date. Gather up as much documentation as you can proving your son has lived with you full time - medical bills, school reports, etc.   Did someone go with you when you dropped off your son at his father's house?   If so, there's a witness as to what was arranged at the drop-off - meaning, if you didn't say "keep him" but said something like "I'll be back at 5 to pick him up", and this person heard you, they will make a good witness.   The best advice would be to talk to an attorney. They would be able to help you further and may also be able to swing the balance in your favor if he is without representation.   Good luck to you and I hope it goes well!|`|j7l9gavRaa	just let him do it and when you go to court make sure you have all that documentation showing your payments and maybe have his teachers write some letters saying that he is no longer attending due to his father and i'm sure the court will give you full custody considering you have more money and have been caring for him
sZ5jFgliaa	he has no ties to you girl, thats why hes going back to his ex. you have to sit him down and give him an ultimatum,  either be your boyfriend or be nothing.   simple as, dont get stuck in the situation where he wants to be non exclusive with you, it sucks! and it all ends in tears|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA, learn to trust people. but don't let them make a fool out of you.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Either he is not over his ex, or on the rebound.

IF he really did like you alot like he says then why the hell is he kissing on his ex girlfriend..you shouldn't be going through this and valorate your self a bit more, he is not worth your time, he is not the last pepsi on the desert..good luck
bWpEcgR0aa	your question is not clear at all.....what are you talking about?!?|`|dE0vtX2eaa	i guess so. but if he really is openly in love with the girl he likes then he shouldnt as that would be wrong. however, if people just think he likes that girl. its fine. if you are 100 percent sure of him liking you, then, maybe he's embarrased and is trying to cover it up by saying he likes someone else.

I always find that when you stop looking for love, love finds you! People can lie on those surveys and you can end up spending a lot of money to date crazy people. Just go out to clubs or if you're shy, to the library. Hang out with friends, meet new people.|`|cWy17SRnaa	I have tried the whole online dating thing.  I found real and true love when I did not expect it.  I was on a T-mobile web chat and that is when I found him.|`|FzFSzilmaa	never needed to... ;) am quite capable of getting off with women on here... ;)|`|GUUa1s6Laa	No but I have encouraged my friends to do it.

AA10065812	Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|SsfnitjXaa	You are not a dead beat dad unless you don't pay the money the court said to pay.    Why did you not take a cab? Why was the son going to court?    In the meantime do not discuss anything with her about you pursuing joint custody.  Simply show up on time to pick up the kid and drop him off on time.  Record any conversations you have with her.  This woman is evil.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Wow, she plays hardball, doesn't she?|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Fight for whats right.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	You brought this upon yourself. You could have called the court, explained to them the situation and the judge most likely would have set the hearing for a later time that day.     You could have called a taxi to come get you and take you to court, as to me...a child custody case is WAY more important than locking a door to the home of a woman that was planning to screw me.    You asked for this and I have no sympathy for you, which is why the court didn't either. You were looking out for what was in the best interest of YOU and not the child.    Courts are very strict in how long you have to appeal a judgment. Most times it can be 3 days to a week. Shouldn't you consult your attorney on this anyway?|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	If you have any documentation for paying the bills witnesses staying you were living together and the investigator is willing to say they told you to attempt to make things work talk to your lawyer or get a lawyer and give them the proof you have against her for custody and then remember what she pulled on you and always be nice for your childs sake but remember fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me|`|j7l9gavRaa	CALL A LAWYER ASAP|`|Syn2MwSHaa	i would fight to the end for what is right mildred is my leader|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	start getting your bank statements in order, if you fixed her car, go find the bill, if you were paying her rent, go find the bill, if you put her and her daughter on your medical, go find the paper work, and do all the leg work you can, plead your case to a lawyer, and bring this woman to justice, she did you wrong, its sneaky, and disgusting, she fought dirty.    Or, you can forget it, let it be in the past, and show the courts you are not a dead beat dad, if shes this horrible woman, her true colors will eventually shine through, you have two options, act, or just let it be, sometimes its easier to just let things go, but good luck to you if you decide to pursue this!!!|`|YDBpaNPzaa	I dint think you will get anywhere on an appeal and as far as the allegations are concerned they are now null and void in the courts eye's b/c you two reconciled and that's why I do not think the appeal work also. The only thing you can do is file a MOTION asking for more visitation than you have now. Because you want to spend more time with your son. And, then let the wheels of justice slowly turn, in the meantime do not focus on what happened and how it happened, focus on your time with your son, bond, bond, bond.   The end result of this messy situation will be as this child grows up he will form his own opinion, and do not talk bad about her ever ever ever to this child. You, will see him drawer closer and closer to you. But, everything you do surrounding this child has to be for the father son relationship in spite of all the dirty dealings. And, I heard this once anything can change at any time concerning custody of children it is never really permanent. In other words he may look at her when he's older and say I wanna live with dad, or any number of things can take place.  Oh! your not a dead beat dad in the eye's of the court, pay your child support and dont miss your visits.|`|b1419de30fc5cf87d7b057074c504c14aa	Even though you were locked out, you should have tried your best to get there.  she knew what she was doing by leaving you.  honestly if your proof was that strong against her i would have continued documenting every thing down to buying diapers, milk, etc even though you were trying to work things out.  keep records and proof of everything all over again if you suspect something is wrong again.  see if in your area they have a fathers advocate that could possibly help you. you don't sound like a dead beat just too honest
hgmexwtEaa	I'm not sure what you mean by mind problems. If that was more specific on what kind of disease she has. If its something where she doesnt remember, dont remind her. Instead, tell her stories. Let her know that you are there for her.Buy her her favorite food.   It sounds like you love her alot. I hope you can help her make the best of the time that she has left.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Find a nice wheel chair take her out for a walk, if you don't have one there are plenty of places to find one for free. Letting her know she is not alone & very loved helps. Let her see the sun that makes everyone smile.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Well yes that can be a good idea or you can just spend time with her, ask her one thing that she likes to do, or she use to do and if she is still capable of doing it then go with her, whether it's a walk in the park, or going to the beach, and don't be afarid to ask other family members for help also, that is very sweet of you to think of your grandmother that way.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	Just be yourself. Tell her about her past, remember the "good ole days". She will appreciate it. There are rough times ahead, most of all be there for her and be PATIENT. There is no reason to not remind her of her bright past... ole peeps like going down memory lane.|`|Ls1oc5syaa	i think it might interest her but you never know at the same time depends on what kind of mood she is in..and if she cant walk get her a wheelchair and show her the outside world and make her knowtis what she is missing|`|nazzGsspaa	Take her on a walk ,on a picnic ,show her your photos ,smile to her and no...it isn't good to not tell her ,her life .Even if it was horrible she must have some good memories
zRil0vjhaa	Congrats on being a good and dedicated mum! Being a mother of 1 is hard work, and when you add to it it get's a little harder. You are totally not wrong for wanting some you time. Since you are working and doing alot with the children at home, do you think it may be possible to ask your husband with a little more help with the two...whether it be alternating nights that you read to them, so you can have a relaxing bath with candles or helping with dinner? Something of the sorts lets a big load off even when it seems so small. Another idea is to maybe switch up the routine that you have with the girls to make it a bit more interesting as well...like a trip to the park, they can play and you can sit near and watch/read. Get out of your normal environment so it's not so "boring". It just sounds very routine and that's why I think you are feeling that way. Make sure you do have "you time". The time you spend alone allows you to replenish everything/energy that you are giving out to your family on a daily basis. If you don't refresh yourself how will you be able to give to your girls?|`|zJAmqLnAaa	I get it - I have a 3 and 5 year old and although they are great kids and I love them dearly I need my own time.  It sounds as if that is what you need as well.  It helps to get some mommy time once in a while.  Go get a manicure/pedicure to pamper yourself, go somewhere quiet and read an adult book with no pictures, have a girls night out with girls over 21.  You really need to find time to be you and then you can more enjoy being a mom.|`|aXYiOskmaa	i hear you. my 2 oldest were 2 yrs apart, husband worked hellish hours. i visited every park in a hundred mile radius with my kids and i did anything i could to get out of the house with them. in my case, i felt as if i were losing my Identity. i was someones mom,wife,daughter,etc., but i wasn't the me i always had been.  nothing wrong with wanting more.
PCpMqpP3aa	go for number two try him out and maybe then number 1 will realise what he is missing out on then you might have the problem of two guys liking you and maybe you would enjoy that even more cos then you can have twice the fun|`|AA11886887	Go with whoever you think you are going to have more fun with.

zRil0vjhaa	If you want to make it memorable, why not get a portrait done followed by a family lunch or dinner. Coordinate with the family and add your own valentine theme to it...if the studio can do a valentine backdrop, have everyone wear jeans, a black top, and maybe hold a rose...    This way, everyone has the same gift, it serves a purpose...not just something that everyone else gets for Valentine's day and everyone will remember it forever.|`|NxpAJInVaa	If you are really looking for a UNIQUE gift idea, maybe you can look into taking a couples massage class together!  I don't know what region you reside in, but if you happen to live near Dallas or the DFW Metroplex, then you may be interested in the COUPLES-MASSAGE CLASS which is taght at Sterling Health Center Massage School every year.  It is a six (6) hour course on that Saturday from 10am-4pm and by the end of the day, all couples should feel comfortable giving a full-hor massage like a pro and without injuring themselves or getting tired!  Its such a fun class and very popular with the Dallas locals who know!  But if you dont live in Dallas, its still worth the search to find a similar class nearby that teaches couples or pairs (such as mother/daughter, etc) how to give a good massage.   Basically, during half of the class you will be massaging your partner and during the other half, yout parner will be massaging you.  It is a unique gift that everybody loves and you can bet that anyone receiving the gift will never forget it!   For anyone interested in enrolling in the Couples Massage Class in Dallas, they can either logon to http://www.sterlinghealthcenter.com or http://www.sterlingdayspa.com or call the massage school directly at +1(972)991-9292 .  I hope this helps!  Good luck and Happy Valentines Day to you in advance!    [IMG]http://i378.photobucket.com/album...|`|vYt7LWTvaa	Time to start a Valentines Day tradition. One year we decorated the christmas tree. But I only had a 1 year old and 3 year old. They thought it was fun to pull off the paper chain and the hearts from the tree and give to each other. But since you have a wide age range go out for a nice dinner every valentines day.
xsaxyB1gaa	Make it personal. Take something that is special to you both and figure out how to work it into an engraving. It can be quirky, silly, sweet, whatever-as long as it is special to the two of you. My husband-to-be is a big computer nerd and uses a lot of gaming lingo when he plays with his friends. I like to give him a hard time about it. On his ring I wrote, "To my husband, you pwn my heart."|`|hkwBR1moaa	It should be something special from him to you.  We're getting on mine  'forever & ever...' and on his '... and a day'  because we always say I'll love you forever and ever... and a day to eachother.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	A lot of my friends put the date.  That way the man can't forget.  It sounds like you want serious.  Grab a book at a store of famous quotes or love poems and pick a line out of one of those.    Find out how much room you have on the inside of the ring.  One that is less than 4 mm across is harder to inscribe.  The bigger ringer he has the more room (and letters) you have.  You don't want something that's too long.  My friend wanted a sentence on hers and there wasn't enough room.  So rather than make it a scrunched up, nearly impossible to read sentence, she used the first letter of each word.  It looks something like this  ILYWEBIMH.    They both know what it means but no one else would.      If you have something from your heritage, that would be nice as well.  If you are Greek, the Greek God/Goddess of love.  A Scot putting the clan motto.    Most people I know put something funny in the inside of their ring that always makes them laugh.  Infiniti and beyond.  Put it back on.  Tomorrow's our anniversary.  My husband remembers the year we got married as the year his hockey team won the Stanley Cup so I'd put the date of both inside his ring.    Location he proposed at, location of first kiss.  Location you went on your honeymoon.  The title of "your song".|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	I don't mean to be rude, but I really don't think you should get your inscription ideas from a bunch of strangers online. Think of something that has meaning to both of you, or you'll feel guilty when you see the inscribed ring and think, "Wow, I wish I could say this was original."|`|AA12071655	Twenty years from now, thirty years from, when one of you is on your deathbed.... as you look at the ring with it's special inscription and he remarks on how wonderful and romantic it is, do you want to find yourself in the position of saying (to him and yourself) "oh some stranger on yahoo answers gave me that."    Be original, be yourself.|`|4lL34wJnaa	My fiance and were considering matching inscriptions.  My nickname is Jill and his name is Mike.  His last name begins with O, so we've always referred to ourselves as Team MOJO because my last name will be O when we finally tie the know in July.  So we were thinking "MOJO4evr" would be cute and simple for us.    Here's the list of suggested ideas for engraving in rings from theknot.com:    Deus Nos Iunxit (Latin: God Joined Us)   Semper Amemus (Latin: Let Us Love Always)   Semper Fidelis (Latin: Always Faithful)   Pari Passu (Latin: With Equal Step)   Amor Vincit Omnia (Latin: Love Conquers All)   Mizpah (Hebrew, Genesis 31:48-49: God watch between us when we are absent from one another)   Il Mio Cuore e il Tuo Per Sempre (Italian: My Heart is Yours Forever)   Amore Mio (Italian: My Love)   Ani L'dodi V'dodi Li (Hebrew, Song of Solomon 2:16: I Am My Beloved's and My Beloved is Mine)   En Bien Aimer (15th-century French: To Encircle With Love)   Por Tous Jours (15th-century French: For All Days)   A Vila Mon Coeur Gardi Li Mo (15th-century French: Here is My Heart, Guard it Well!)   Autre Ne Vueil (15th-century French: No One But You)   Une Dezir (15th-century French: My One Desire)   Mon Coeur Est a Vous (French: You Have My Heart)   Par Grant Amour (14th/15th-century French: For My Greatest Love)   Mon Amour (French: My Love)   Je T'aime (French: I Love You)   Myn Genyst (Old German: My Heart)   In Thy Brest My Hart Doth Rest (Old English)   God for Me Provided Thee (16th/17th-century English)   God Unite Both in Love (Old English)   Forever   Always   Love is Eternal   Never to Part|`|woOeYFrEaa	I went with our wedding date (he can always look inside if he forgets our anniversary) and the phrase, "All for God's glory" which was a phrase from the key scripture passage we put on our wedding invitation and had read at our ceremony.    I'd run by the store and ask how many characters you can fit and you can work backwards to that goal.  Unless he has giant fingers, you can't put much and still have it be big enough to be legible.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	There is a line from an old song that goes "I love you more today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow."  I've always thought that was such a romantic thing to say.  Is that too long?  You could maybe condense it into a shorter saying.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	My husband and I took our time when we were dating to say "I love you" even though we both knew we did.  We actually slowly advanced towards "love" with "I wub you". The first time he said that, I just looked at him and asked "Is that the walmart discount special version of love?" and he laughed and from that day on, we continued to say say "I wub you" or even "I discount special you" until about three months after that when we said "I love you".  Occasionally to this day, we will still break out the "discount special" or "wub".    On the inside of my engagement ring before giving it to me, he had it inscribed with "Discount Special".  On the inside of his wedding band, I inscribed "Wub Always & Forever"    Take something that means something to you and your fiance and have that inscribed.  Yea, sure, I get strange looks from the lady at the jewelry stores when they clean my ring and see the inscription, but everytime I see it, it makes me smile and remember back to when we were still dating.  It means something to me.|`|RaWIRGYmaa	I went to this website to get some ideas:     http://www.e-weddingbands.com/store/engr...    It should be something special between the two of you, but these ideas may help you get started.  I didn't use any of these, but it the way one idea leads to another, it gave me ideas I probably never would have considered.    Good luck! :)
domEftoIaa	if he really wants to be with you then he wouldn't have started dating this other chick. give it a few days or weeks and see what happens. if nothing then move on.

People get divorcesd for a reason, usually its b/c they cannot come to HAPPY medium ON issues and that doesn't always mean there is NOT love ...but it means they are not IN LOVE!    I cannot give you that particular answer to your situation . ASK HER!|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	OMG! She really did that to you? It sounds like a bad soap opera plot. I hate to say it, but it really does seem like she was using you as bait to get the other guy motivated. Sometimes women use drastic measures to prove a point, but there's no excuse for how she toyed with you. I'm sorry you had to deal with this.|`|j7l9gavRaa	how rude!  i think you did get used, you could support her at that time and the other guy still needed some growing to do, she waited with you until he was ready|`|lb6s0Yvhaa	ouch. thats pretty harsh.  i don't want to make you feel bad,  but i think she did only marry you for what she needed.  but maybe she did really love you,  but loved the other guy more.  i don't think that if she didn't love you at least a tiny bit  she would have married you for even that short period of time.  but you don't need her.  any woman to do such a thing is not worth it.  trust me there are way better women out there.  and you'll find the right one eventually.  (:|`|8QOlaQWgaa	You were crazy to marry her if her reasoning for not being with the other guy was "because he couldn't provide for her and her kids."  Sounded like she was using you from the beginning.
34ruM1eDaa	Cant understand why would you still wanna have that "relationship" with this "friend" I'd ask for an explanation and then cut off all ties.|`|ZPTmbQW4aa	Sweetie if you ARE already receiving VULGAR emails from this friend OBVIOUS she/he is NOT a GOOD friend Nor do you have a GOOD relationship so let me correct you on that FIRST.... If you were    Then she/he would have talked to you about whatever is bothering them versus writing you nasty emails. They would have sat down and talked to you about WHATEVER it is that has them feeling the way that they do but they WOULD NOT have just started writing you nasty emails if they really were your friend  and if you had a good relationship with them right,    So all you CAN do is simply reply and ask them why the change of heart ask them why are they being so nasty and distant with YOU NOW.... And if the nastiness continues then you need to just cut your losses and move on... Obviously the person did not really think of you as a friend if they couldnt come to you and talk to you about whatever it is that has there panties in a bunch then what does that say to youi about the type of PERSON and FRIEND that this indiviual is....    In my opinion NOT one that YOU really WANT or NEED in your life..... So you know what she/he  just did you a FAVOR, they showed you WHO they really are and what they are really about so cut your losses and move on... They did you a favor... Bump them and find you a better set of friends............ Because I am 33 years old and my TRUE friends have NEVER done no crazy mess like that and if they did then I would not want to be there friend ANYWAY if they cant come to me and talk to me....    And futhermore you DONT let ANYONE disrespect you or degrade you for ANY reason.. And if that is what they are doing in their emails that they send to you then you REALLY need to cut your losses and let them go... Dont let ANYONE DISRESPECT YOU OR BELITTLE YOU OR DEGRADE you for ANY REASON   Good Luck and God bless|`|QqY8YgGDaa	First check the ip address and confirm whether it is really sent by your friend  -you can send e mails to me through this yahoo section|`|BuqVi5IBaa	send an even more vulgar email back to him or her, its the only way|`|nfGDZWfBaa	First ask yourself on what she was being vulgar about. Then see what your reaction is to it.  sit back and go through what she is saying.   is it true or false.    False end I would tell her to get her facts straight right from the source rather than assume something. and tell her to grow up.  If it is true  ask her why she is doing this and ask her to talk face to face if she is a true friend.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	just ignore it..if u still feel uncomfortable..talk to ur friend that all this makes u feel uncomfy....b straight forward!!|`|1PedqsYAaa	tell your friend that it turned you on?!|`|7xeC7FLIaa	hey just tell him or her that u dont like the vulgar mails ok be staright forward ok and plz avoid those frnds|`|yUfDsCWqaa	i'd say just e-mial them back saying something along the lines of  please do not send me e-mails like this one again. Thank you    my friend was sending me religious ones and i got tired of it so i said something like that to her and she stopped and we're still friends|`|YTf8OnYBaa	Be plain and clear. Say "That is a nasty email." "Do not send anymore like those."   If they are a TRUE friend, it will not affect the relationship except to make it better.|`|Ok5JIcmzaa	If you're really good friends, they'll understand when you tell them to stop.|`|e9bb69fe846238c30e6955cc8f654653aa	I would just reply that you really don't care for those types of emails and would s/he just send emails that are more appropriate. If this person reacts negatively to your request, I would suggest that s/he wasn't a good friend to begin with. Honesty is best here, you should not have to be harassed with questionable material in your inbox.

BUT what would worry me is "too many kisses at the end of a text" more than 2 and your desperate is my motto|`|sr0vZPQqaa	That lot sounds about right.|`|C8opQMAVaa	i think that before you get to attached you should stop texting until he texts you first, that'll be the real test to show that he is thinking of you.  by you always texting first he doesnt get the chance to text you before he gets one from you, try it just see what happens.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	YES FOR THE PIERCING IDEA.|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	I know a guy just like that.  If he's shy, why don't you ask him to do something with you and a group of friends? That way it's not so awkward, you know? And I think it would be an awesome idea to ask him to come with you to get your piercing done. Cause that's not really a date.  Just text him and be like "Hey, I'm gonna be heading down to (wherever you're going) to get my (etc.) pierced, so if you wanna tagalong, that'd be cool with me. :)"  That's probably what I would say.  And as far as texting goes...I would just text him only like 3 days a week. And then see if he'll text you. And also, try waiting a while to text back, because that keeps him on edge. Try not texting him back in the middle of a conversation, and then see if he texts you the next day.    Things like this take time. I would ask him about the piercing, and then wait for him to ask you on a real date; IF he's interested. Good luck! He sounds like a keeper to me. :) Don't text him too much, too. You don't wanna scare him away!  God bless! :)|`|WJOp1xgraa	well you belive in him so much thats good that mean your in the right track :) so jzt belive in him and keep it going|`|H42WbQATaa	please dont ask him on a date.....a girl should never have to do that ...just show obvious interest ....and if hes interested he'll ask you out eventually. but a girl asking you out might be a bit of a turn off, dont u think?|`|U69RieVwaa	Lets see if he doesnt reply he may not be interested but he also may just be nervous though I will assume it will be the first. If he likes you yea he may say yea, but he also may say yes if he likes you just as a friend, if he says no with no reason he may not be looking for what you are and if he gives an excuse it may be legitimate, so all in all ask because if you never do you will always wonder what if, but take precautions and just remember the alternative of being friends is not always bad|`|nCXOZBFZaa	In my experience, men always paid more attention to me when I was the least available! Go figure. When I wanted a date, I could not find one prospect. When I was too busy to think, they were knocking my door down. Do not make yourself too avaiable to this man and watch how he starts texting YOU!  If that does not work, then perhaps you are not the only one in his life. Either way, you will be happier knowing just where you stand with him, better than letting you heart flap in the wind!
kjAQj3i7aa	I'm sorry, but the woman you love is a total *****. And she also sounds  completely nuts. You didn't do anything wrong.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	She's mad because you called her bluff.  The whole thing was a ruse to get you to come running to her rescue at the alter.  Instead she was forced to marry a guy she really doesn't love.  And now she's pissed.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I don't know. It doesn't make sense to me either.  I don't get why she would've involved her sister either.      There are better women than her anyway.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	She is a stupid *****!!!  You were only returning her stupid things if she didn't want them she should have just threw them away and that was it.  Why would she or her sister call you and tell you off?  If I were you I would be glad that she ended it she seems pretty immature and is probably too blind to see that you are a decent caring person.  You don't need that drama in your life. She didn't even have the decency to break up with you in person probably cuz she was already seeing some other guy while you were away! Just count your blessings that she did you the favor and move on you sound like a really nice guy.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Why didn't you just let it be? You didn't have to mail anything, should of just thrown it in the trash and respected her marriage. You didn't love her anyway or you wouldn't have dated her that long without marriage. Shame on you. Leave her alone.
I3V7hE32aa	I agree, officiants should come prepared with at least a basic copy of vows.    However, to find vows that are more to your liking, and with a little more personality, just google "wedding vows".  You'll find lots of ideas there.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you shouldn't have to supply your vows to the officiant.

You might want to look into getting a new officiant.  Most people who perform weddings come prepared with what they are supposed to say.

Good luck, that is really great for you to step up!|`|ie5hk2hKaa	IMO Child services want to keep children with blood relatives but your brother would have to be on the at risk register before anything about you gaining custody of him takes place so speak to child services.    Once he is, I would expect he would be asked what he wants to do and child services will take over from there.  Your mum would have to be proved unfit to look after him as well.  Takes quite a bit of time though.

Speak to a lawyer who specializes in these types of cases.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	It would depend on if she's been declared incompetent or not. If she can't even take care of herself then you could possibly have her declared incompetent, if she can take care of herself and your brother, then I think you'll have a bit of a fight on your hands unless the abuse is really severe.|`|0lnamekJaa	It shouldn't be that hard if you can get in front of an understanding judge...    You will need your brother to agree... He is old enough to know where he wants to be...    If he goes along with it then the chances are pretty good...    If he is against it... Consider the case lost...

Or maybe you should write her a sweet little note letting her know that you are concerned about her well being. Good Luck and I will be praying for you two|`|oWKOlJyjaa	Well, as far as these problems go, I have a feeling that your psychiatry friend is right. It may just be a personality disorder. But, she may be mislead by your attempts to help her. You need to make sure she is fully aware that you mean to help rather than make things worse. Remember, when it comes to self-realization, the first step is denial, the second step is finally acknowledging that there is an issue. When it comes to getting help, the first step is addressing the problem. Kind of like admitting that there is a problem. If she still refuses help, use reverse psychology, tell her to go just to prove that there is not a problem. Maybe then, if she decides to go, she may find out that she does have a problem. Perhaps she is not even aware of this situation, and that is why she keeps denying it. It seems to me that this is a very touchy subject not usually open and welcoming to a conversation. No child's life is perfect, so don't feel that you are being bad parents because you have family matters. It happens to everyone. I'm not saying 'who cares?', I'm just saying that having these kind of problems doesn't necessarily affect the children to an extreme level. If there are marital disputes, that's one thing, but total violently aggressive arguments are another. That is what affects children. However, you don't make it seem like that. To me, it seems more of a situation you keep between the two of you. Just remember, you need to confront her, make sure she is fully aware that you are trying to help her, and when she keeps refusing help, eventually you will need to take matters into your own hands to get her help, before anything worsens. I hope I somehow helped you. I know many types of relationships, and the way people live and think. I may be only 16, but I grew up very observant with peoples' actions. Much hope and luck to your future.
Wk4k7Q5Qaa	There seems to be a problem which he can't seem to figure out. It might be with you our even maybe himself. You didn't say how long are you married? With him mentioning a marriage councillor  , you should  find out if he's serious about it and if he is take him up on it. It shows that he is also worried about your relationship and wants things solved. I feel only good could come out of this. If you go for counselling  you both have to be open and willing to cooperate with each other ideas and your councillors suggestions? GOOD LUCK|`|h7xh61TWaa	He has communication problems. See the marriage consultant, it might help.     You can't live in that situation so you need to voice that. If he has problems though which is the root of his actions, give him time to work it out or help him work on it.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	he's finding some ink in the company pen if you catch my metaphor|`|jPESbdyyaa	It means there is an issue and he would like a third party to help direct the conversation and help the two of you to communicate better.      Maybe he's having a hard time telling you something or explaining something, or maybe you are nagging about it too much, and he needs help telling you to stop.  Either way, you should go -- it'll help both of you.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Its something.  He's not telling you the whole truth.  That's why the instant arguments.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Try counseling. Dont let this fester for long because until it is resolved one way or the other your relationship will only get more distant.|`|I5AxDuOYaa	There is something that he is not telling you, and my guess it is something that he is not comfortable telling you alone. He needs some help to get it out of his system. Hun, when he mentions the marriage consultant you should say "I think that is a great idea!" make it seem like you are just AS interested than he is to meet with one. THAT will for sure get his attention because right now, to him all you are doing is complaining to him. When you stop complaining and be equally interested he's gonan be like ".....huh?" like as if what the hell happend to you...you know?. THAT is gonna scare him because than he will feel he is not the only one with the problem and it is gonna make him wonder and think and drive him crazy like what the hell could it be. Listen honey, do not look so scared and worried in front of him..do NOT look needy and sad...be normal. He wants a marriage consultant right? great! your (husband) paying for it...and when he tells the problem in front of someone else...guess what, you have a right to be upset (if it does upset you). If he still shuts you down after you guys figure out the problem...and he stills argues with you etc etc...sweeeethearrrttttt, you have a problem and than turn the tables around and start taking some womanly control. DO NOT look needy at that point. You better be in control. You have a right to express your feelings okay? you have a right to know what the hell is up. He is your  husband...you did not marry him so your life can go from fantastic to a piece of s h i t with sex coming once every 2 weeks alright? NONE of of this is your fault. It is his problem and you are going to figure it out. Once you figure out the problem, you have the upper hand and it is up to you to make all the "big" decisions. Do not react and go all hay wire in front of him. Just be calm, straight faced the entire time. Remember this, Do not let things or people upset you..never let it show on your face...when it does not show, they are powerless. Your reaction is their only power.|`|FHrrKxO5aa	go screw someone else i'm sure that would get his attention.    Ok all B-S aside that was bad advice but what have you tried to get him interested?? Try getting a can of whip cream and make a whip cream Bikini with cherries on top if he doesn't respond to that then yeah something is wrong you might have to go see a counselor. if you love him and want to be with him you'll have to do what ever it takes to keep him, but don't seem to desperate that's a turn off.  Oh and don't keep "nagging" him about sex let him come to you.|`|3ywVS2JEaa	he mentioned marriage counseling that means he trying to work on things and apparently ur oblivious to any issues going on...at least he's not lookin for a way out or cheating..|`|4GmeIopoaa	Maybe because you are so insecure??
nfynTFnTaa	You could give him a framed picture of yourself so that you will always be near him.    You could fix him dinner or take him out to dinner. It need not be anything too fancy, he will appreciate your efforts.    Make him or buy him a sweater- a substitute hug of warmth when you are not available for him.    Find a cologne you like (if he does not already wear one).|`|BbEo2HOzaa	I second cici's suggestion.  If you are sexually active, then:    I have never forgotten what a girlfriend did for me and this happened over 30 years ago.  Go for a drive in the country.  If your boyfriend is driving, wait until you feel comfortable about asking your bf to pull the car over.  If he ask's why, tell him you want to show him something.       Don't say anything, just go for his zipper and give him a bj.  Don't stop, take it all.  I guarantee he'll love it.  It's been over 30 years and I still rremember every detail to this day.|`|SweWC8p1aa	are you sexually active?|`|5r48jn7iaa	he should be making plans for you. but you could always make him a nice dinner....take him out for a cute movie and pay|`|8s17AXI1aa	I Think You Should Take Him Out To a Movie and Then A Nice Dinner!|`|AA11886887	Valentines day is a bad day.

God present are so overrated when it comes to valentines day.  Make breakfast in bed, filled a bunch of heart shaped balloons and let him wake up to them.  Make him a coupon book of things he could receive from you (if you're sexually active it could be sexual things, dates to go on, movies to watch, massage etc etc.)  do something unique and i'm sure he'll like it.  Some people (men and woman) only like material gifts and get pissed if they don't get them.

dvX11ttNaa	You should wait for him! I know you really like him, but you should let him be with his girlfriend. He obviously has feelings for her and thats why they are dating. Wait, and see if they break up, if they do then its okay to make a move, until then you should hold back. If they break up it means they were not right for eachother, and you shouldnt feel bad for asking him out afterwards. Hint around at it maybe, but dont ask him out until after they break up, if they do.    Good luck!|`|03GQ637Raa	If you know your friends girlfriend, I would not make any moves on him.  It is gonna be hard, but you should try to set your sites on someone else.  However, if you don't know his gf, then All is fair in love and war SMILE!  Catch your friend by himself and let him know that he is a great friend and u r starting to have feelings for him beyond just being a friend.  If you want this guy, you can't be shy.|`|tIo72iVtaa	well you shouldnt rush things because if you push up on him he may take it the wrong way. you should wait until hes single before trying to make a move.its normal for a boy to like a female s company but if your just friends you should keep it that way.dont do anything to make another person hurt.by that i mean dont try to get with him because it will hurt his girls feelings. in plus there are alot more ppl to date. find a single man. it aint that hard
TWW5DGttaa	Ignore his jealous attempts, he is immature. If you respond to what he is doing especially in the way he wants you to-with insecurity, he will keep going with it. Set the example and show him if you two really like each other and no one else there needs to be a trust things going on where games don't play any part.|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	Prolly some people need to know how you feel about them and if you do not tell him then he is trying to find out in whatever way he can.

lRPqQmL0aa	How on earth does anybody know how safe they are?? It is just your sons ex partner who knows!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Well, Ireland has an extradition policy with the US so this shouldn't be difficult.  You'd file charges, he'd be arrested for kidnapping in Ireland, and shipped back to the US.    As for how safe they are, that depends on the expartner.  She can't violate the divorce decree.  You have them every weekend and they are gone without your knowledge, she has kidnapped them.  HOWEVER if you have just been watching them every weekend and there is no divorce decree that states this, you are in trouble.  Grandparents rights is a new and very controversial subject.  You probably live in a state that won't give any credit to this argument.  However your son should have the law on his side should he file charges.|`|jfvfgtLAaa	If they are with their mother and to date she has looked after them without any problems like drugs, alcohol etc then I would imagine that they are being looked after as they were before and that they are safe.  Their mother is going to care for them as a mother would.  If the kids were well and happy before hopefully this is the case now.  I hope you get some news soon.  Without knowing the circumstances of why she would behave in this way it is difficult to judge how long but if the eldest is 8 and upwards chances are he will know how to make contact him or herself?

I don't see any trust here do you?|`|NuUdCz0Laa	The question is not should you stay or should you go, it is should you allow him to stay, or should you kick his a** out the door.  Yes, your a mess and you appear to have some dependency issues, but first you need to kick this SOB to the curb.  Once he is gone, then you can focus on yourself and getting you head straight.  Look at what attracted to this guy in the first place, make a note.  When you start dating again, check that list, and make sure nothing matches the new guy.

Ask him to leave and don't let it be because of his behavior.  Let it be because you care about yourself.  Know that you deserve better than what he's giving you.  I think it would be better to be alone that live like that.  Also, if someone comes along and you have that thing around you will not br able to pursue it.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Hmmm this one is difficult.  Do you really believe this is what he wants or are you just something thats convenient for him.    If you really love him and feel theres a chance you two could be in a nice relationship then it may be time for you to put your foot down and see how he responds.    Dont ask but tell him that you want this relationship and that you have scheduled counselling.  See how he reacts to this.    Tell him he needs to come clean and open the doors of honesty for this to work out.    today i want you to take ten uninterupted minutes and go someplace quiet and have a look in the mirroe.  imagine yourself 10 years from now with this guy and see what kind of results you get.  ultimately they may not be what you want but they may be the truth.

Without trust there can be no lasting relationship.  If your gut feeling tells you he is cheating...then he probably is.  Good luck..I hope this helps.|`|lzooHi0Baa	I can  relate to your situation.   I really hurt for you, you are in one of the worse situations a relationship can be in, addictive and abusive.   You want your cake and eat it too.  There is no way while he is out hanging out with friends that he is not going to be sleeping around.   Take the blindfold off.   Of course he is not going to leave you, he has everything going for him.   A roof over his head, a maid to care for him, a woman to feed his ego.   Stop playing his mother and take the position of a woman with dignity.    Again, I went through the same thing and I regret the 3 years I wasted away due to my insecurities and relationship addiction.    Pray for wisdom and strength, that is how I was able to defeat the monster.   Good luck|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Id say yes to both questions. Get out of the relationship and work on yourself. What is exceptable to you at this time in your life sounds like something you dont want. Co-Dependant No More. Untill you address it this bagage will go with you into all of your relationships. Be aware of the Pebble Sack analogy.    Pebble sack is a sack you wear on your back/over the shoulder so to speak. A pebble is representative of the trials tribulations feelings etc that we toss into the sack instead of dealing with them. Its amazing how much that sack can hold...stuff stuff stuff stuff..As with all things though your tolerance of how much the sack is holding isnt the same as your bodies and eventually things will seep out.    I say Leave no stone unturned and rid yourself of it instead of storing it up to weigh you down.|`|ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	You are the only one you can look towards to make a decision on living happy. You are not happy, you stay because you fear being alone. He has lied, he has cheated on you, he has totally disrespected you. What will it take to make you leave him? If you stay you have no reason to complain. If I were you, I would have left a long time ago. The guy sounds like a complete loser. Someone you cannot make a life with. Love is based on trust and there is none here. So you decide. You stay and take it or you leave and find someone who will make you happy.|`|hrFGKAeraa	Leave his ***. He's 37 years old and is acting like a child, he needs to grow up. I know leaving him will seem difficult since you've been together for a while and are drawn to him, but you deserve better than this. You need a man honey, not a boy.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	A mess?  All of us are a bit of a mess.  However, if you are willing to put up with a man that will stay out all night, or come home at 3AM - and live a double life where he has friends he doesn't want you to know, and phone calls he doesn't want you to hear... you probably have something to work out.  Don't let that make you feel bad about yourself, we all have something to work out.  However, let it lead you to action.  You need to chose to only be intimately involved with a man who loves you.  This man does not.  Doesn't matter if he has loving feelings for you, or is "in love" with you - he doesn't love you because he doesn't want to share his life with you.    You need to move on, and be confident enough with yourself to be alone until you find a man who does love you.  Sounds like this guy is using you, and you deserve better than that.|`|8449a75b059164ff6d7636d90b469f9daa	You are not the one who is a mess. Sounds like he is living two lives.    Sounds like he is not being honest with you. You already know you need to leave. Where does he live when he is not living with you?  Sounds like he is using you for a place to live and a peaceful place to sleep. 37 and he still hasn't gotten he head on straight.He is not a responsible person and he is not trying to make it better. He should be   trying to find full time employment or at least trying to find a Second part time job!!  We're in a recession for goodness sakes.He is just hanging out like a teenager whom you have to remind he has a curfew.  What about you? You probably don't get any sleep because of his late hours and surly ways. If he spends all his time with other people and doesn't want you to know who he is talking to, yes it sounds like he has other females in his life.          Sorry.   I think you should kick him to the CURB.Before it is too late. You can do better and yo deserve better.  Good Luck
ZSznCJhSaa	I never used to understand what girls meant when they said they were addicted to a guy even though that person wasn't the best for them... until my last relationship.    Of course, the first answer is to try talking with him and explaining how you feel. But I know from experience that when we try to do that with these guys it either turns into a fight where it turns out to be all our fault, or they say they understand and of course they will change and then turn around and behave in the same way anyways.   So if that is what happens when you confront him with what you feel then you have to decide if its worth it to be with him or not.    My last relationship the guy was emotionally abusive, but I was addicted to him anyways and couldn't find the inner strength to leave. It doesn't sound like your guy is necessarily emotionally abusive, but he definitely has some undesirable and disrespectful traits... such as possibly cheating!     I asked a couple questions on Yahoo Answers about whether or not I should stay with him or go. But looking back I realized I was asking because I already knew the answer... that I should go. I just was looking either for someone who would validate my addiction and make me feel okay with myself for wanting to stay, or that someone would tell me something that would give me the strength to go.    When there isn't trust in a relationship, it hurts both sides. It hurts you because you are always worried, always wondering, always hurt and upset because you don't know what your loved one is doing. It hurts your loved one because they feel restrained, they feel like they can't exert their independence without being made to feel badly and the fact that the one they love can't trust them is a deep wound (that is of course if they aren't doing anything wrong, if they SHOULDNT be trusted well then...)     Unfortunately when there isn't any trust involved, that usually means that you should at least take a break. Explain to your guy (if you want to be with him in the long run) that you love him and hope to be with him again, but that he has to pull himself together with his childish behaviour and being unable to account for his time and so on and that YOU also need to heal and pull yourself together so that you can hopefully come back with full trust and love.    Either way, if you want to make this a permenant break or a short one to work on yourselves, it needs to be a clean one. Unfortunately it is all too easy to get pulled back into things before youre really ready with the guys we are addicted to when you have any sort of contact with them.    Anyways, I hope that helped a little bit and wasn't to preachy. :)    EDIT: If you want to rant about this some more or need someone to listen to you or anything at all. If you need to talk more about this or another problem, just email me. I have tons of free time and would love to help if I can in anyway.  Best of luck to you.|`|7dAh8B3haa	leave. im rying to leave a relationship as well. its not worth it at all.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	What's the point in showing it?  The house is half his and if he says no, you can't sell it anyway.    If you are on decent terms you could try to talk him into it.  You know we are going to have to sell it for the divorce and in todays market, the fact that someone can buy it now is a miracle.  This isn't a sellers market right now.  He may be concerned about you.  If it's not listed as an asset in the divorce decree you could hide the money and it would be hard for him to prove that it's half his.    The restraining order means he can't go within so far of you.  It doesn't mean you can go to his house and follow him around so that the police arrest him for being within so many feet of you.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I would imagine it depends what the divorce papers say. If you have been given the house to sell after the divorce is final, then yes you would be able to show the house before the divorce HOWEVER the buyer could not move in until after the divorce was finalized.  Your husband could not call the police, and if he did they would do nothing because you're not doing anything wrong.  If the papers don't state specifics about the house, then you'd have to make sure the details are included in the papers so you can show it now and avoid losing a buyer.|`|wzEfAVP2aa	yes you can show it as long as you let the police know.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	Yeah I guess I would have a talk with my lawyer and also bring the police with you is a good Idea.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Keep the house , raise the kids in that house ...Do not move them ... SUCK IT UP as adults . When the kids are raised  SELL split,the profits ...go your own way . !   ONE Parent  will need to wake up and MOVE on now .  This is whats BEST for your kids . STABILITY ...  When ...IF ....the market gets better then sell .  You can always put  in the contract the person living there needs to keep up the mortgage100 % and if the payments fall back farther than 1 month they relinquish their RIGHT to live in the house .Make sure the move out time is within , by court oder 2 weeks of the late payment date on the mortgage!.. Makes for some serious  child custody issues!! Kids don't want to LEAVE their home ! If you cannot agree ...LET the JUDGE do it ...Ya both get screwed out of your savings ,a life investment and you both go on to RENT something MORE than what your mortgage was .... SEEMS DUMB to me . It doesnsn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is best! Good Luck!You cannot sell a house without the spouse approval during the divorce . If ya do ...it will be brought up in court and you will , THE person who got the cash , HAVE to pay the other spouse back the PROFIT!  If both your names are on it you have to have a quick claim deed to sell!  SEE YOUR LAWYER!!
ZPTmbQW4aa	Talk about what you have in common with them  What your hobbies are  What you do after school  Can you hang out sometime  Family life  Work life if you have one  There are alot of things you can talk about just BE YOURSELF and you cant go wrong...

CcyRyb8vaa	Just engage yourself in casual conversation. You know, when a large group of people are just hanging out in the classroom, try to get yourself in the mix. If you want a one on one conversation, say something simple. Ask about basketball, or whatever sport is going on. You just have to act natural and have normal conversation. Don't just walk up to someone and be all, "OMG, I wanna be your friend". Just start out casually and eventually you'll find people you connect with and just go from there.    Freshman year is always awkward. It takes awhile to get situated.    Best of Luck.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	if you are a freshman in college then most professors suggest you get at least one students number in case you miss class one day or something. they also suggest you find a study group so just ask if they want to study sometime.       if you are freshman in high school just comment on what a cool shirt someone is wearing or anything random and just keep talking.|`|WFP46Ek9aa	my email is rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com|`|7HwQi3Xsaa	just be yourself. go to them an just say hi. can i just hang out with you guys. but if they dont want. is they lost. one person secpial

Is this guy that you love gay also? Im just really worried because if he's not and you just say "I love you" you could get hurt! If he likes you too or if you know that he's gay too, just come out and tell him that you really like him. Be honest, but only if you know that it wont lead to serious problems! Good luck!|`|HRJkHuw4aa	well, just to protect your self, find out if he is into guys first. if he is then just say it, or you could always do something really nice for him, actions speak louder than words.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	just ask him if he wants to be the pitcher or catcher|`|RvFwmQOPaa	First you need to find out what his sexual preference is so that you don't make the mistake of admitting feelings to him that he may not share. You have to be careful because at your age teens can be cruel. He may be confused about his sexuality and not ready to come out with it. After I find out where he stands, I would tell him that I really enjoy his friendship and see where he takes it from there.|`|dE0vtX2eaa	ask around and find out whether hes gay or not. then, assuming that he's not eyeing anyone else. go up to him and say. you know, i notice you and i really like you. your personality is great. i think we could be great. what do you think? should we show everyone that we could be together?     and thenll you can tell whether he's been thinking the same thing or not|`|upazUCA6aa	Tell Him|`|4bvq4IAxaa	Ummm make sure hes gay too.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Keep it to yourself and just do your studies.

Unless he seems to be "open" about homosexuality... I wouldn't say ANYTHING.

I would try to find a different love interest that you know is one the same page you are.|`|8s17AXI1aa	Yeah I Agree Make Sure He's Gay Too And Then Tell Him Very Passionately!|`|M0GoGVHXaa	No dont tell him. It will make things awkward and it will freak him out.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	lol at some of the answers. Is the guy gay too? I have a question too.

PITCH|`|piHVQmXdaa	well first you have to find out what sexuality he is. If he is straight and you confess your feelings, you could scare him off of your friendship all together.  If he does feel that way about men, well go for him!|`|bGSakeeMaa	i know how you feel it was so hard to tell my ex girlfriend that i loved her when i first realized it. first i would try and leave hints and find out if he is gay or bi as well that's always a good plan. it could be that he might put his guard up because he doesn't want others to find out but still just leave some hints. when u become closer to him just walk up when u two are alone just say. "there's something i need to tell you, you can hate me after this but i needed to get this off of my chest. i like you, really like you." and see his answer. if he returns then congratulations. if not then i'm sorry. just if he's really popular and you don't want others to know i would be cautious. i hope this helps and good luck|`|swV3SIw7aa	i swear im sorry that ppl are such homophobes on the internet  i support you all the way  just tell him that you like him  if hes a homophobe like some of the ppl HERE  -glare-  then just try to move on ok?  it will be hard  there are way too many guys afraid to let ppl know they are gay in this world so im glad you can admit it  :]  good luck!!|`|543f99b0563265529584573c7c9cb709aa	Well.... this is rather difficult. I would recommend you to tell him even if he is not gay, but there is many homophobic persons.  I'm not gay, but there have been gay persons that have declared their love for me, and I try not to hurt them or anything, but I think it depends if you are willing to take the fall if he is homophobic.
ZSznCJhSaa	Walking away from someone you love and are a little addicted to is one of the hardest things in the entire world. To lose someone you love without a choice is excrutiating but when YOU decide that its unhealthy for you to be with someone you still dearly love, even though its for the best, it hurts even more. (Because the decision is all on you)    There is nothing that anyone else can do really to help you be able to leave him. It has to be a desicion that you make within yourself. But some things that help is reconnecting with friends and taking refuge in their advice. When you decide to break up with him just keep in mind one thing about being independent (like you don't deserve to be treated the way he treats you or a peice of advice a friend gave that really struck you) that is really important and repeat it over and over despite what he says.    He will try his hardest and say anything (even lie about changing and such) to keep you with him. OR he will try to manipulate you into thinking twice by pretending he doesn't care to make you feel badly. But either way just keep repeating in your head, I don't deserve this I don't deserve this.    When you break it off... do not contact him AT ALL for at least a couple months. That will be the hardest part. But it is the easiest thing to fall back into a bad relationship just from seeing them at a weak moment.   You don't need to remove him from your memory completely, but put anything that reminds you of him away in a closet. Delete his phone number from your phone so you can't call him or text him as easily (even though you could probably find the number again, going through th process of finding it will make you stop and think) when you are feeling weak and lonely. Delete him as a friend on your social networks so you dont get reminded of him every time you see his information on a news feed.  Do not take his calls.    THis doesn't mean you can't talk to him some day in the future, obviously since you have a child together... he will be a part of your life, but just not right away if you really want to get over him and out of the relationship.    If you need to contact him about child support, do it through a mailed letter. That way it is removed enough for you not to get sucked in.     Its going to be so difficult to get out of, there is no way of sugar coating it. But by recognizing that you need to, that is the first step! You are strong enough, I know it. You can do it.    If you want to rant some more about it, need some more help with how to get out of the relationship, want to tell someone the whole story or just need someone you can talk to to get you through it... feel free to email me! visquex@yahoo.com   or you can go to my profile and email me through that. I really really don't mind.    You can do it!|`|oMIxJTO1aa	For the sake of the child think carfully about this, make sure if you leave you are financially safe, and the father is paying to support this child. As for staying or leaving...leave silly, noone deserves to be cheated on, and you can do better, life is 2 short to be around or with those you cant even trust...or who dont love you enough to be faithful.     Best of Luck, hope all turns out well!!|`|0udjgaoBaa	Its not hard! Every time you want to smile at him think about him kissing the other women, think about him holding them, think about him spending time with them, and last but not least think about those herpes that he could give you at any minute...I think you deep down inside have low self esteem you need to get over that do what you need to do to make yourself feel better....Hope that helps
AA11486567	You have to explain to your parents that just because their christians doesn't mean that their telling you about their religion and trying to change your mind on your religion. Explain to your friends, even though their probably already not doing it, that they shouldn't talk about religion when their around you. Good luck!!|`|jxhBk2cyaa	no i have all different kinds of friends of different religons and i love them|`|AA11356977	And thats why I dont like religon. I find them to be hypocrits. I dont believe in god and my best freind is very into god. We get along great becasue we accept that we both have different bleliefs. We never try to change the others view. I  think that most who Claim to be into god are the ones who get into more trouble. Thats been my experience. They are forced to believe what their parents do and hten rebel. I say stay friends if you want to .

hc3gee2Zaa	Give specific examples of what you like.  That would help me feel more comfortable.  I used to play sports.  I have gained about 20 pounds since High school.   Hearing that my partner thinks I look good is great, but when I feel overweight there is not much she can say.  This is one of those things he might have to fix for himself.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	Some guys will always feel uncomfortable. Guys are just as insecure as girls! It sounds like you've done pretty much all a girl an do! Just keep it up. Compliment him often but dont push him. His insecurities are in his own mind and there isnt anything that you can do or say to change that. Its in his hands. YOu can talk to him and see if he would like to get back to the way he was in high school. You two can work out together, in your home or you can give him some time to work out alone. Be supportive and if he isnt ready to take off his shirt at the beach, be understanding.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Probably the better bet, for his own health, would be to go jogging with him and such.

He smiles always, so i think im getting through to him.  your partner doesn't have anyone else to impress right? so if u like it, thats all that matters. tell him  u don't want him to change. u love him just the way he is.|`|5r48jn7iaa	my bf's the same way.    whenever he tells you something about his body just say i love your body and give him a hug. you cant really make him love it too but you can let him know you love him how he is.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	Im also a big guy and i used to be all muscle and now im not so im very self conscious I wish i could find a girl like you that doesnt care bout weight more then anything....Im a loyal guy i treat women like gold i always have but im scared that i cant get a girl unless shes fatter then me cuz i dont wanna feel embarresed of my weight im not HUGE i mean im 5'11" 250 lbs skinny arms and legs its just i have a gut Im not ugly at all its just my weight.  But to answer your question i dont think there anything else you can do you say you tell him you like the weight he has i think he makes coments so he makes it clear that hes not happy with himself he doesnt want you to think that hes comfortable with what he looks like thats all he want you to know that if its a problem he'll try to do something about it(maybe) im not sure exactly !!

51d1c6e908e8b6df4f1ad94d96870afbaa	talk to her bout this obviously.. for one thing, she is ur best buddy, which is enough reason for u tlk to her about it. Besides, according to what u've posted here, its not just u with whom she is behaving like this to. so if anyone should be talkin to her about it, it should probably be you. Just make sure u dont piss her off in doin so, or els u mite end up losing ur best pal! njoi!!! :)|`|7HwQi3Xsaa	talk to her. tell here bf come an go gf allways there when you in need|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I would talk to her. I don't think you should tell her that you think she becomes a *****, but just tell her that when she gets with someone she acts differently and that you want things to be the same with her even when she has a boyfriend because you love her, or her friendship means a lot, or however you would put it. If you're as nice and sincere about it as you can be, maybe she will realize what she does.|`|5r48jn7iaa	talk to her!! let her know shes changing and you just want your old friend back.
E6C64Ui1aa	I been in this situation before,i have been the friend of the guy that gets accused and nothing was going on and i was also the girlfriend whose boyfriend was always talking to his female friend all the time, it might just be that from past relationships your used to being lied to.  The more you accuse him the more he is going to pull away from you. If you were being accused of something like that and no matter how many times you deny it eventually you are going to just do it because it wont matter your already being accused of it even if you weren't doing it before. Does that make any sense to you??  So if he says there is nothing going on he is probably telling you the truth, if you stop accusing him and show more trust in him then things should get better. That doesn't mean you have to trust her. Just trust him.     I hope that helps some.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I say if you are that mistrusting him that much move on, she is his friend and he isn't going to stop being her friend because you are checking up on him day and night.    Personally if I was him I would drop you for being so nosy.  I couldnt stand a guy that would do that to me especially if he was just someone I was going with for only 7 months, there is no committment between you two, and that length of time isn't a long time at all!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	I doubt many people will even read this because it is to long.But You should trust him.Just like you'd want  him to trust you.Just because he flirts with people doesn't mean anything.its not like you don't flirt with other guys.|`|bFLP6COgaa	It really sounds to me like they're nothing more than friends.    Why don't you tell him that you want to meet her so you can become more comfortable with her? Who knows, perhaps the two of you will become friends as well.|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	Uhm, trust him.  He's obviously serious about you if you and him are practically living together. However, i'd talk to him about your issues. Telll him you have had a rocky past with relationships and you care for him a lot.    He'll probably be angry, but let him know your not accusing him.    HE needs to know you trust him.    Tell him that if she's important to him - you want her to be close to you too. I don't think it's right nor fair that he's keeping her away from you, that seems suspicous. You two could be really good friends.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	I'm going through the same situation. I'm a very jealous person, especially when I'm in a relationship.  I've been dating my boyfriend now for 9 months, and have always had a problem with him hanging out with his ex, who he dated for 2 months. Prior to the latter, he was married. Not only that he has many female friends.     Many of us females are insecure, especially when the ex comes back. Usually when we hear "ex" we get defensive. What bothered me mostly is the fact that my boyfriend doesn't want me meeting his ex because he knows things will break out between us. (I just don't understand why he keeps hanging out with her if she's judgemental, stubborn, and still have intentions of getting with him)     The only thing I can say is trust his judgement. I'm sure that your're and insecure of her. The best way to get rid of this is talk to his ex and get to know her on a personal level. Then you'll know her intentions. Many females know the intentions of another female just by getting to know them. It's instinct. And make sure your boyfriend understands how you feel. Without him knowing, he'll never understand. But understand, he's known her a lot longer than he's known you. Trust his judgement, he seems like an honest man... he'll tell you if he ever did anything wrong (knock on wood, and hopefully not) but he seems like a good man especially since he has a son.     Trust me, easier said than done. It's hard for me as well. Good luck|`|vAyvv5ngaa	their relationship right now could mean nothing..but sooner or later it could bloom into something more..if your bf values you and doesnt want you to get worried, he should introduce you to her..like have dinner with her or something..he should always fill you in about the stuff thats going on between them..  try not to snoop too much though..coz it will just make him hide more stuff from you..maybe he's scared to tell you some stuff coz he's thinking you might react negatively or something..  why not talk to the girl?just make sure that you talk to her in a friendly way..|`|jFDgA70naa	:)) agreed|`|nYEwK5FNaa	No I'm a "manwhore" and what he does is exactly what I do.|`|zRBdicAlaa	maybe money will fall from the sky too. if he was honest he would not have a girl staying with him|`|RihPWIfBaa	Trust your gut. if you think he is cheating on you dump him now. if you stay with him and accuse him of something he may or may not be doing he will get sick of it really quick. If he's going to cheat on you there is nothing you can do to stop it. the extra security and monitoring will only make things worse.|`|JHYwzWSbaa	i just pasted this into a word document and it is 766 words long :|!      but i did skin through it and i think you are slightly paranoid - it is normal though!      im sure if he went through the pain of being cheated on, he wouldn't even think about cheating on you      best of luck hun!|`|hQh5ZtAUaa	Well my advice to anyone that feels jealous is do not stress over it because whether you act jealous or not, if they are going to cheat they are going to do it regardless. The truth always  comes out! Relationships are based on trust however they are also based on respect. He should prove to you this girl is nothing but a friend and possibly introduce you to her. I have many guy friends and I am going to be honest and tell you that more than half of them have girlfriends and they hit on me every now and then. I however, make it a point to meet their girlfriends to reassure them I am not interested in their boyfriend. You should really meet this girl. Once you see how they interact with each other it will be a lot easier for you to recognize signs. She does sound like she is intruding and just because she is young doesnt mean she should not know her boundaries, especially considering she used to be married. Im sure she wouldve not appreciated girls texting her husband at late hours. You deserve the respect from both of them but who knows maybe they truly are friends.|`|LzkSscDSaa	haha we are girls! i used to have the exact same problem because as any girl, i too got cheated on! uummm now for your situation, i will go ahead and say keep your eye on them, because i dont necisarly think its your boyfriend you should be worried about it should be her, because in her head she thinks she can cross the line now because shes not married anymore, and your boyfriend should know damn well he better not cross any line being as he is together with you! Im not gonna say they are definatly doing things together, but......you did your research so it could be a possiblity. about 3 years ago my boyfriend (at the time) cheated on me with a girl he had gone to school with, and the way i found out was by confronting the girl, calmly!!! It worked like a charm and see had admited to everything. I broke up with the guy and we winded up getting back together and stayed together for about another year and a half, when lo and behold he cheated on me about 10 times with that girl in that time period!!! But what im trying to say is, theres only so much you can give! If he is indeed cheating on you, please take my advice and leave him because if he did it once, hell do it again. Im now engaged to a amazing guy named ian whos done nothing but make me so incredibly happpy, keep your eye on him because no more girls need heartache over men anymore, Or try confronting him yourself, It may work expecially if he loves you! some men are willing to come clean, the others.....they just dont care....hope that helped, feel free to message me on yahoo if you have anymore questions....    my email is ashleycelauro@yahoo.com :)
ba9d16f9a309b045361ff22238034b23aa	Yes, but wait until the divorce is final so it doesn't get brought into the mix.  Take what you want from him (property and sex) and then let her dig her nails into him when you are done.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Depends if its for vengeance or for her own good.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Jenny,  Just one question for you.  Were you as loving to him "physically/sex" when you were married as you are now that you're getting divorced?  Or did he find a girlfriend because you had a "headache" one too many nights?|`|jjt2enntaa	I would write her a letter or send an e-mail.  Let the traitor explain that one to his gf.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	A letter is to easy, it also can be put off as a jealous ex wife attempt to ruin the relationship.  The best way to get your revenge is to record the event, then send the tape to her, that way she will see the type of person he really is.  Good luck.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	OH YES INDEED!  I was too nice during my divorce. More power to you girl!|`|m8UEGUaGaa	She is no longer the "other woman" She is "The Woman" who took your husband. Let it go! Your issues are with him and him alone. Leave her out of it she was not committed to you in any way!    Stop giving yourself to a man your divorcing and who left you for another woman.    Good Luck on rebuilding your self esteem because the games you are playing are only going to hurt you.|`|j7l9gavRaa	yeah i would tell her haha she did it to you BURN!|`|AtJgXB59aa	nope she didnt write you no letter and if he was with you first then do what you want|`|vFCva8R5aa	In all honesty as fun as it may be to do that it really is pointless because he will deny it to her forever and she will believe him over you (the scorned ex-wife)|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If she did it to you she gets all she deserves but i wouldn't make it as easy on her as a letter, i'd leave signs on him for her to start getting suspicious. Let her stomach turn over as  i'm sure yours did when he was cheating on you. Make sure he smells of perfume, leave a little earring in  his pocket, lipstick on his shirt. Let him deny things to her as he did to you!!!! Let her suffer as you did.|`|AA11016526	If she didn't tell you do not tell her  enjoy being the other woman|`|4el3goYMaa	Honey, if you like the feelings you get from it, go ahead! I think that this is hilarious and a good way to pay her back. But, keep in mind if you write the letter with a "hahaha look what I'm doing tone" she may think you are jealous of the two of them and not believe you. I would make the letter sound as if you feel guilty that you are still having sex with him and you just wanted her to know. That'll burst her bubble.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	The woman he is with will never be with him and him only, she shared him with you before, this news isn't suprising.    Your better to just leave it how it is, what if something comes up in your divorce and he busts you for slander and denies ever sleeping with you? Have the last laugh, just dont say anything to her, it could create hella drama, something you just dont need.    The ex, once a cheater always a cheater, and karma has a funny way of making things even, you ll get your justice in good time|`|f6YsGOynaa	Sorry to fill my answer with cliches, but you're cutting off your nose to spite your own face and your soon to be ex is having his cake and eating it too.      If you're ok with that, than good for you.  However, If I were you, I'd save the news that you're sleeping with him as your "ace in the hole" to spring on her when she's feeling overly confident that she stole him fair and square.  Make sure you have proof...dated pictures, or something.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It should be a breeze getting everything you want in your divorce case after consistantly banging him.  Your self respect is gone and you should practice constraint.  He's trash...or is it that hard to see?    Oh, and skip the letter and tell her yourself...maybe you'll like her too in person.|`|Oo9CG8xMaa	Ask her to come over and join, in a way you are already doing her too!  EWWWWWW|`|lOSSXKWIaa	he** yea tell her.  she done it to you.  so let her suffer.  good for you with the divorce.  hang in there.  have sex with him till the divorce is over then let him be the one hurting.  sucks don't it.  but yes you should tell her today!!!!  good luck and my thoughts are with ya.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Will you feel exhilarated when you have Herpes, or AIDS, or chlamydia?  How about genital or oral warts.  Boy that will sure get her back won't it?|`|r1y8ZSmoaa	NO! if the sex is good tehn no|`|zJAmqLnAaa	Why a letter.  Have her over to reconcile differences while your ex is in the shower.  Let her feel the betrayal you felt.  I would want to see her face when she found out!!|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Wait until you are officially divorced.  Make sure you have sex with your husband AFTER you are divorced, then send her a letter, or better, drop by her house with the used condom!  Tell her he's cheating on her with you.  Then, start finding all the dating and married men you can - and keep that exhilaration going!  Start sleeping with all the men you can get into bed that have a significant other... and tell their women you are having sex with them.  Think about how exciting that would feel!    Does that sound pretty horrible to you?  It sounds pretty horrible to me too.    If you're ending your marriage, end it.  You are so much better than that!  You can find a man who will actually care about you and love you.  And that this dog is sleeping with you?  Don't fool yourself.  A semi-hot total stranger could walk up to this guy and get laid - he just wants sex, it isn't you that does it for him, you're just better than his hand.|`|89TgOjXpaa	Oh in deed i would tell the tramp! now see how she feels!|`|YDBpaNPzaa	No, I would not write a letter, and if you think it's going to get to her, It won't do you really believe you can hurt or even shock her by letting her  know what's really going on. Nope, reason being this she really does respect relationships married or not married, she believe's if it feels good do it. So, I am pretty sure she believe's that the rest of the world think's this way as well. And, who know's she might be getting her a little on the side as well, it's not like she has'nt done it before. If she's not then she will just to return the favor to him, and then he will to return the favor and so goes the roller coaster. And, has it crossed your mind that he's still sleeping with you on the side to try and get in the good graces with you  so that you don't take everything he has through the divorce proceedings, it's seems that everyone involved has a motive!! Do yourself a favor, you have been through enough heartbreak, let her have this low life, let her put her time and energy, and sacrafices into this unfaithful relationship and let her in time figure out how it feels to have someone do this to her. All you really need to do is let it run its course, she's not better than you surely you know this. She's not going to do more for him than you did. And, if he cheated on you after all that you did, What do you think he's going to do with her? And, as far as this divorce thing goes sleeping with him is not going to make it fall in your favor, cause he's doing the same thing hoping that it falls in his favor. Do  this on the up and up and let the courts decide what's fair. Doing the right thing for yourself that is moral and upstanding will have it's rewards, things will go your way. Move on and start over with some diginty and class, you will have self confidence oozing out of you and that's extremely sexy!! Before you know it you will meet someone that wants to be loyal to you and value's the person that you are.STOP, putting yourself through this, those two people are not worth the self destructive damage that will take years to overcome.|`|dprURFLxaa	I agree with KingAndrew - tape and send her some good viewing material.|`|3vbHZBioaa	I am assuming the reason for your divorce is him cheating on you? I would not right her a letter remember what he was doing to you when he was cheating? you'll never forget that I am sure...Have fun being the mistress..take him for all you can in the divorce he deserves that..sounds like enjoy being the other women nothing wrong with that but if you write a letter she's not going to believe you and he will stop coming over this way he'll be thinking about you like never before do things you have not done before in the marriage when you were married ooh he's so going to want you even more...Have fun You go girl...Good luck
RIVywiykaa	they will be there for the rest of your life.

P49Ie95xaa	Go and stay with him for a week or two. But before going make sure you tell him it is only for a week.|`|j7l9gavRaa	if you don't want to go don't   he can't pressure you he is your father and he should understand|`|ojqWNSJMaa	Wow, this is a no brainier.   Go to school!!! Da ya think?|`|hrFGKAeraa	If you're happy where you are then don't move. Attend school more though, because if you're kicked out you might just have to move in with your dad.|`|r1y8ZSmoaa	well idk. lol|`|nazzGsspaa	If I were you I would stay with my mom .You know you can be better at school and make both of your parents happy but if your father says he doesn't need to pay c.s than don't go to him ..If you are a girl you will find it more easy with your mom ...because your mother is the only person that can really understand and love you who you are ... so it is in your hands ...just remember that a mother is the worthies person in world|`|rPfguQwCaa	make your dad feel better by being honest with him.
5agXk9ldaa	let him watch the movie :P:P:P  look if it is a romantic movie buy him a red flower and give it to him when a kiss is showing ;) you know what i mean with a soft small kiss and then look into his eyes with a little smile just little one and tell him i love you|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	if its your first date, smile at him a lot, hold his hand. Give him a kiss on the cheek when you're done and thank him for the wonderful evening. Be a lady. If its your first date, just a sweet smile will be enough to make him blush!|`|dE0vtX2eaa	go watch a shocker thriller movie and hold his arm and lean in towards him. then go out and give him a hug and a kiss. make sure it lasts. that'll be the best present a boy could ask for|`|Y2sDswLBaa	Start off with holding hands. That should always be the first step. Also if that works fine and he doesnt pull away i would suggest rubbing his hand, thats always romantic :)|`|LZVc3Uwaaa	the head on the shoulder is always nice if you feel that is still a little much for you do something simple like share pocorn that may not seem romatic to some but if he has true feelings for you he will appreciate it|`|hiSa7qthaa	Break that barrior and make him feel comfortable. Take controle, put his arm around you and lean on him, get close.|`|AaOI2WSGaa	just put u r head on his shoulder or   u can maybe hold his hand !  since its u r frist date,  dont be forward !|`|DtEnHza6aa	don't do anything.. let him guide your way :D|`|NNWerE4Jaa	start by touching you'r pinky's together then work your way to hold his hand! then kiss his !!|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Well, the best thing you can do is let him watch the movie. I loathe movie talkers.    As far as making him feel good, take his hand and give it a little massage. Or you can put your arm around his back, rest your hand on his neck, and rub his neck and head.     I do those things for my boyfriend and he's stuck around for a year and a half now.|`|uQswOjy9aa	after the movie kiss tell him that I was the best to spend time with him he will like it and it wouldn't be going too far.|`|6URJzob4aa	Hmm it all depends on your personality really. Mostly I would say be yourself and nothing more or less. If he is going to date you, make sure that he likes you for you. And don't feel like you have to go out of your way just to make him feel good. Respect yourself unlike alot of girls out there. Show him that too. If you respect yourself he will respect you, atleast a good man would.|`|8s17AXI1aa	It Depends What Kind Of Movie Cuz If It's A Scary Movie Act All Scared!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JowyDgSJaa	Compliments work great. Speak like a human being - how you feel and what you think. Remember, individuality is the most attractive as it is strong. Who's into weak women? Not I (well, not into women at all but you know.)     Don't be too "generous" on the first date, keep the relationship suspensful and show him that you have value, and when you do get generous, then that will boost his ego/self-esteem and make him "feel good as well as happy."    And rememeber, your birthday is about you! he should be on Yahoo asking this :P. Happy birthday, and have a great day.
gPlUDaRoaa	Well, you are pretty young yet but you will learn that friends can grow apart and want different things from what they said they wanted when they were younger.Also,it is good to not just have one friend.Go out there & make lots of friends you can never have too many.Keep in mind that just because you two wont be at the same school doesn't mean you can't still be friends.|`|AtJgXB59aa	go into the new year being opened and let other people know you want new friends..just keep in touch with your friend|`|gF8gTZJxaa	You can be happy for her because she is doing what she wishes to do and that is making her happy, you do what makes you happy, if it takes you away from each other you don't have to lose contact, you can still be good friends.|`|Rq2tMCQdaa	you just have to think about it as if it were you. if you had this great opportunity to go to a school and learn about things wouldn't you want to go to that school? :)
SHDA3k5Caa	hahaha no. u r too young says the guy sitting right next to u lol.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Sure...that doesn't sound crazy at all - what?? with the divorce rate so high and all.  Sounds like a good plan to me.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No.  Wait until you grow up.|`|j7l9gavRaa	no, if you are still together in 5-10 years go ahead|`|gLXzVbm8aa	honey you have a long way to go and a lot of people to meet. i dont wanna burst your bubble but wait for a few years, you never get to truly meet and know everything about someone.|`|TVz2UoOyaa	NO coz i think you're too young to get married..  you can both enjoy you're life together even  you're not yet married..and when you really think  that you are ready for the responsibilities for having  a spouse then go get married..     you're only 15 and have many things to do..think  of your future..just enjoy life!|`|ON84EQaBaa	Marriage is a life time commitment at 15 you're still trying to figure out who you are, you are so very young, and marriage should'nt be on your mind, the two of you need to get your education, go to collage and if the two of you feel the same way about each other then think about marriage. Not at this time!|`|P28G0a1Raa	Absolutely not!|`|hrFGKAeraa	Hell no, don't do anything irrational. Date her, if you're together for more than 3  years then go right ahead.|`|MoXraT6yaa	I really don't think so, I am 21 and my husband is 26 and we have alot of problems in our marriage..I beg you to please wait, marriage is work..hard work... Me and my husband were so into each other before we got married, nothing about him made me mad, upset, irritated..but now he does.....you have to work on marriage to make it last and it is not easy....please wait until you are a little bit older...if you get married now, you may end up divorce because you're so young right now...|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Hell no.|`|Qq4H1VJNaa	i dont think now is the right time because u are too yong but i have felt that way mii self but if u both are meant to be together then stay together and in about five to six years i say go for it but no one says that u cant act like your married just stay fully commited to each other|`|ojqWNSJMaa	NO. NO. No!!!!!!!!    your young , but you don't have to be nuts too.!|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Dude you have your whole life ahead of you.If you two still love eachother in a few years then go for it.I would say right now you are both too young.Whatever is wonderful right now will last if its truely meant to be.|`|9VaWal2Daa	My answer would be NO.     Can you support yourself? Pay bills?  Care for child should one come along.......let's say she's pregnant within a year......    who watches the baby?  and you support her and the baby HOW?     at 16?   Let's all get real here, okay?|`|zJAmqLnAaa	No, you shouldn't.  People change so much that it would be easier to wait.  If for only one reason - divorce is ugly and expensive.  If you must be together try living together first and see if it is worth it - after a few years see if your feeling are the same and then start planning that wedding.  Give it some time!!
RHux2Fmnaa	Cheating is not a physical act. Cheating is the intent, the thought, all the actions and the attempts at being intimate with someone other than your spouse. In my opinion, your husband is cheating on you not with one person, but with several. How disrespectful and totally insensitive of him to say that they are just "pictures". They're not just pictures. He knows their names, who they are, where they live, what they like and dislike, etc. I'm sorry you have to deal with something so painful and demeaning.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Me and my wife share a face book. its just better that way.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I'd be pissed! If he did this secretly, he's hiding things. A lot of guys like to look at half dressed girls but they sure don't have to call them 'friends'. If he has to do this behind your back, it's cheating.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	That's YOUR husband???!!!!|`|iM2BaJbeaa	You are totally right! I had this problem as well...some of the excusses they will come up with huh, anythig to justify their actions. I told my hubby at the time (NOW DIVORCED) i said this is degrading to me your wife, i am suppose to be the one to fulfill all you fantacies not some picture. I told him how it made me feel as far as not being good enough for him and not being attractive to him. He told me i was just being jealous so i left now that we are divorced and i am remarried he admitted to cheating on me not once but twice and said that the stem of all that was from him being addicted to the internet regarding sites like that, he appologized and admitted he had a problem and it was nothing to do with me. So watch your self|`|AA10248966	Move out for a while secretly while he is out, and teach him a lesson on the results of his having been disrespecting you.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	"But to me, when you are sending friend requests it suddenly becomes a interaction between real people even if its via the computer"    That's just called reaching out and megabyting someone.|`|j7l9gavRaa	let him know how much this is really bothering you and he should delete it, why can't he just watch regular porn to get off? he shouldn't be secretly interacting with other women|`|f6YsGOynaa	I don't think it's any different than if he were to go to a strip club without you, getting lap dances, and collecting phone numbers.  He may not be cheating yet, but he needs to be reminded that these are REAL women, and not just pictures of people he could never meet, like on porn sites.  He's treading dangerous ground here...    Only YOU can determine whether or not it's cheating, but if it were my husband, I'd probably demand he delete the accounts, and stand over him while he did it, as well as install a keylogger on the computer to ensure that he's not lying about anything else.    Good luck to you.|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	First of all he made an account without wanting you to know, so in terms that kind of cheating, well in my book.   Even if they are just pictures I would feel like I wasn't enough for him.  You need to tell him to delete the account.  my husband and me know which sites we both go to and we both know each others passwords.  We dont' keep anything from each other, but we have a pretty open relationship too.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I understand how you can be insecure over him looking at pictures. But these adult pages on facebook didn't get setup strictly for your husband. Accepting and sending "friend requests" on facebook is meaningless, and you are taking an action and trying to compound it by making up ridiculous reasons to be even more upset. And some of these women are just egging you on with "well it's kinda like cheating because youd didn't know about the account". Absolutely ridiculous.    "But to me, when you are sending friend requests..."    This is no different than some woman thinking that a stripper at the club would single out and want their fat broke down husband of all the men who walk through the door.|`|J6KraUzUaa	Why don't you do the same thing to him?  Make another account on facebook and add guys in it and join groups of sexy guys and make sure he finds out and when he asks you about it just innocently tell me "just pictures to me and  I enjoy looking at them" and give him a seducing smile then wink at him and walk away.|`|W76VDFKCaa	Many people, not just your husband, think what they are doing is innocent but it soon becomes an addiction.  If he spends a lot of time on the internet then he is neglecting his responsibility to his family.  If he is using a family computer and your children use the computer, they could be exposed to this adult content too.  There is nothing wrong at looking at porn every once in a while, but engaging in actual interactions with people whether in person or via internet is crossing the line.  You should ask him to close this account and seek marriage counseling since he is keeping secrets and seeking acceptance somewhere else.|`|ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	If he has not cheated already, he is attempting to. No pun intended, but it appears your husband under estimates your intelligence by thinking he can say "they are just pictures" and get away with it. He is doing things that lead to cheating, if he has not done so already. Stop letting him treat you as a pushover.|`|AA11356977	I would be sick about it, hurt and feel like I was living a lie. I would end it/ He is simply taking baby steps on his way to cheating. This is how it all starts then they have the balls to say  " It juat happened". I say B.S|`|98154758777a4e64556f587f3efee74baa	FACEBOOK RUINS LIVES!!!   It causes drama, it makes people get caught in lies, it allows perfect strangers to mess with things that are none of their business.     For your sake and the sake of your marriage, he should delete it.    Just tell him, it bothers you and you wish he would get rid of it. If he's loving and respectful, he will.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	It is a betrayal and hurts your trust. Decide for you if this is something you want in your relationship. If no tell him if he chooses to not respect that then you have a bigger decision to face. Know yourself and your limitations and set and stand by your boundaries.|`|4cdq26oraa	Oh, don't kid yourself. It starts supposedly innocent like this with just groups, chat and friends, then it starts to gets closer to that line until finally he's crossed it and never coming back. I'd nip it right now and find out why he feels he needs to get that kind of excitement from other women.  He's obviously getting something out of this that he feels he's not getting from your relationship. Stop it now before it's too late.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If he just wanted to look at the pics he would watch porn. Facebook is an opportunity to talk to, get to know and meet these girls. That is the difference. Even if he deletes the account he can make another one in secret as he did this one. I wouldn't trust him.|`|UaSb84BOaa	Reminds me of my ex-husband. He thought that the internet was not cheating. Well, it is. I completely understand the way a guy will turn his head when a pretty girl walks by and may sometimes look over his girl's shoulder at another woman. When they start sending "undies" pics then it's a bit far. If that were to happen in a public place - like in the above scenarios - they'd be arrested for public indecency.   The way I see it, if he wants to look at other women, then fine. Do it when we're out in public. Don't sneak their pics from the internet. That's cheating. No matter how you slice it, secret messages and hidden emails and half-naked women....it's all the same.   I would tell him that. Make him realize that this behavior hurts you and you're not going to accept it - and don't fall for his "you're jealous" routine either. If he loves you, he'll stop for you.

Zu2oVVhoaa	If your fiancee loves you then he wont let this come between you! If he does leave you then he wasnt the right one for you! I have done something similar to my fiancee and it almost caused us to break up ... but you need to realise that this is not the same guy you dated in the past! the is a new guy! a new relationship! Do you honestly believe he would cheat on you? Im sure he wouldnt ... he just probably thinks you over reated! Just give him time to cool down! Maybe try explaining why you acted this way! Or even say sorry! Just always remember that he wasnt the one that cheated on you!|`|SsfnitjXaa	Back off and give him some space.  Men don't like to be crowded.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I have to wonder why he would tell you about the ex flirting with him when he was aware of your history and most probably knew that little bit of info would cause a fight.    something like that makes me think he was hoping you'd break up with him or react in a way that he could "justify" breaking up with you.    If you're engaged to him then you should know him well enough to know if he is into that kind of game playing or head tripping.  and if he is, you're life will be much more happier and peaceful if you do let him go.  that will free you up to meet someone who is stable.    But if you feel you must  make another go of it with him, then give him a chance to cool down (24 hours) then call him and tell him that you need to talk and he needs to tell you what is going on with him.  You can't save something that he isn't willing to do his share of the work on and you can't even begin to start fixing it if you don't know what is broken.    fwiw:  if you're old enough to be married then you're too old for your friends to know your personal business and gang up on him over your disagreements like a bunch of high school mean girls.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	you could start by apologizing to him and telling your friends to as well.  He was being honest that his ex was flirting he probably wanted you to hear it from him not someone who might twist it as you and your friends did.  You should apologize stop listening to friends and allowing your friends to meddle in your affairs.  If I were him I would be thinking very seriously about dumping you because you don't trust him.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Why did he tell you his ex was flirting with him was there a good reason? Have you told him your fears of the same thing happening to you again? There is a real reason why you are insecure with this issue.   I feel like when someone gets mad at you because you accused them of something, they probably have something to hide. Wouldn't the right response be more kind & considerate of your feelings? I heard nothing nice about him or anything he did for you, except you love him.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Yeah great way to take your past relationship problems and throw them in your boyfriends face. **** he was being up front with you, telling you that something was going on you might not like. Most guys wouldn't have told you, and then you get your friends to yell at him. **** that I'd be pissed too.    What you need to do is just remind him that you love him and try to work on your trust issues. You might also consider putting off the wedding until you trust him more. give him his space and remind him that you love him. Apologize and wait for his answer.|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	I don't think you should take it.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	WHAAAAT? WHY WERE YOU CRYING BECAUSE YOUR EX CHEATED ON YOU IF U NOW HAVE A NEW BOYFRIEND??????????  THAT'S DUMB..I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GET MAD BECAUSE HE IS STILL TALKING TO HIS EX, BUT WHY ARE YOU BRINGING YOUR EX UP??? WHAT THE HELL?|`|SmFVG8eXaa	If he's gonna leave, he's gonna leave. You can apologize to him for acting extreme after finding out.. explain that it was something that caused pain the past.  If there's nothing going on, tell hiim you respect him for telling you and trusting you.  Give him a bit of time and space to realize that he does love you still and doesn't want to breakup. This doesn't sound like a major thing to ruin a relationship over.|`|YUMqQZBzaa	Try to be more secure - if he is telling you his ex is flirting with him then you don't have any reason to be upset with him. He is being up front - not keeping secrets or flirting back. You should also keep your friends out of your ****. You need to apologize for letting your friends get involved and for being so insecure, and then talk with him about how you can work it out. To be frank, it seems like a flimsy reason to want to break up though. Maybe there are some underlying issues or past episodes that are also at fault?|`|JwnHKTabaa	Tell him you love him, but it's all up to him.  Tell him you hope that he will stay with you, but if he doesn't want to then he shouldn't.|`|74d22a359a13b539bf60f128a3450a53aa	im sorry (in fact Im not) reading your question, He doesn't sound all that loving. He knows you have been cheated on before & instead of reassuring you He goes off on you?! Some fiance...   And even if you could "take it" you shouldn't have to. So what he has stress, so does a lot of people & you don't see them yelling by text & not speaking to the ones they "Love". Think long & Hard about if you want to tie yourself emotionally, legally & financially with this man.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	First of all, he was honest with you by telling you that his ex was fliting with him.. if there was something untoward going on, he would`nt have told you. The fact you let a private matter spill into the point that your friends were yelling at him, probably means not only did you hurt him by not trusting him, but you made something private, public. So what if his ex flirted with him? He told you about it, and he is WITH YOU... not her. Not all men are the same, so your ex cheated on you, but that dont mean this one will. You need to get your own insecurities under control, keep stuff between the two of you private. In moving on, he needs space, send him a text saying you are sorry for blowing up when he told you about his ex flirting with him, tell him you let your insecurity get the better of you because your ex hurt you badly. And apologise for your friends behaviour, it was wrong of you to tell them and they should never have spoken to him the way they did...   Hope it goes well for you.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	First your are getting married to this man not your friends. You should not have allowed that.    I completely understand you having issued with a past cheat, however this is not the same guy. It is very hard to trust but since being at fiance status already I would assume there is some trust.     Give him his space and let him cool off. Maybe if you can't let the past go it's best to let him move on. You can't hold him responsible for the others screw up.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	Set him free and if he comes back to you it was meant to be|`|jv8RK3sgaa	i think you should first examine your self ..bcuz it seemed like you over reacted ... if i read correctly he told you and  you didnt find out about from some one else.. so obviously it didnt mean any thing to him. i think that if you dont take for your self and deal with that trust issue... you might end up taking it out on him, and he might resenting you and thats not good.. you also need to realize that he is not your ex...im not saying break up with him... but you defiantly need realize that and take time for you becuz if you do get married befor you deal with this issues it may end in a devorce or alot of arguments..!!!|`|6RGOxxd5aa	Kill Him, and make Body Burgers out of him.

Remember, this is a guy we're talking about, and it's very likely when February 14th rolls around he won't even realize it's Valentine's day. So don't blow it up too big. Keep it simple. Avoid stereotypical Valentine's day gifts like heart shaped boxes full of chocolate and teddy bears saying "I can't BEAR to be away from you!" and corny stuff like that. Keep it personal.     Valentine's day is all about letting someone know how much you care about them. How much do you know this person? Could you fill up an entire card with inside jokes the two of you have? If you were to spill your heart out to him would he care?     In 9th grade my boyfriend made me a very strange valentine's day gift. He took an altoid box that was shaped like a heart and made a belt out of it. O_o while it was very strange I loved it and couldn't believe how much effort he had put into it.     It sounds weird but he got the idea because I used to eat altoids all day long. Think of what your bf likes and be creative, but keep it simple. If he forgets, don't get upset and you'll look good because you got him a gift.|`|MuzqSYjwaa	get him a spell checker, that's something you both can use|`|cq4ng6QLaa	I think you should get him a big teedy bear.|`|bCJjTFiwaa	well, try to understand and have empathy to each other. you are both still young and go have more time to play and learn.

I'm fairly independent, so I don't have a problem with alone time-in fact, I find that I need it once in a while. But somedays I miss him deeply, even for just the workhours we're apart.   I don't like sleeping without him, now that we've been married a few months and we've gotten accustomed to sleeping next to one another.|`|iM2BaJbeaa	i get a sick feeling, i hate being away from my hubby :)|`|Bc4udMhUaa	It really depends on whether it's on my terms or not. If I needed a night out with the girls it's great. I do find I missed him and the kids when I get home. Mostly when he goes out I am fine and enjoy the quiet and the time to read or clean, but other times I might miss him or even be a little jealous because he does go out quite a bit and I feel a little "put on" b/c I am left with the children while he's out having fun.    Though, I do try super hard not to act on that latter reaction.|`|OG4410bdaa	I enjoy it when he's only gone for a day or so  like when he goes to work 8am-5pm and I stay home, that's a nice break,  or when he has his "married guy game nights" (thats when he and his other married buddies get together to play video games and board games, usually on a Friday night from maybe 8pm-2am when the wives and kids are all sleeping, and the men don't have work the next day), I enjoy when he goes to that as well because its a nice break    but my husband is in the military and although I've been lucky enough that he's never been deployed, he has had to go for out-of-state training for alittle over a month and when he did that I was miserable without him...the first few days were nice, the first week I got alot done around the house, but it was hard to sleep in a bed alone and after that first week I became bored and lonely without him|`|j7l9gavRaa	i miss him and i wonder what he is doing/thinking or if he is missing me too|`|mAPSl0DZaa	For the most part good.

I liek having him around|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Absence makes the heart grow stronger. I enjoy being away and going out with the ladies, I also usually cant wait to get home and be with my fiance again.    I also love it when he goes out to school during the week, it gives me a chance to get some serious studying done without him "interupting" me, and the best part? I get to watch my favourite tuesday shows from 6pm-9pm :D. When he comes home, I am always so excited to see him, and I feel refreshed, usually my homework is all done, and we get to spend the rest of the week together    There are times when he works over time, or on the weekends, this usually depresses me, 5 days a week is enough for him to be out of the bed super early, I really look forward to waking up at the sametime with him on weekends.     I would say I have a healthy "I miss you" but also a healthy, "Yes I get to watch my favourite shows, and go out with the ladies tonight" type attitute when I am away from my partner.|`|224598c2e3c1d07cad06c082f551c456aa	i hate it..... it used to not be so bad if i saw him every few days.. but ever since he went away for like 5 days i cant stand to be away from him!|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	FREE...totally free....but she always comes back :(|`|x3LclBZ0aa	my boyfriend is always in my mind regardless of whether im with him or not. but when were apart, i miss him but know that "small break from each other" only enhances my feelings for him.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	Great.|`|vNlyRmB7aa	I've been away from my fiance for a year....he's deployed to Afghanistan, and it sucks...BAD.

Everyone needs space to be themselves like if they are always there and you never get to be alone you dont get to work on who you are like moms,  they need a break once in a while from the kids to be an adult and talk to adults not just the kids she needs to be who she is or she will lose herself.|`|4GmeIopoaa	It depends on my day.

Mostly, I miss her presence - being able to hold her body against mine when we go to bed, see her beautiful face, see her mannerisms when we talk, being able to look across the family room at her, just knowing she's there with me.  For a day or so it is kind of fun to be able to just hang out in the hotel, or hit the sports bar for great burger and a game, and feel free to not worry about whether I should bring her, or get home to her - but after a day or so, the desire to be around her far outweighs the fun of worrying about only me.  So by about day 3, I can't wait to get home!    We've been married 8 years and I've been traveling 6 weeks a year for work for that last 3 years, and I still can't wait to get home by the 3rd day or so.|`|3ywVS2JEaa	"FREEDOM" !~!~!

yijmoNbSaa	dump him.  he's worth neither your time nor your effort.    he, clearly, has decided that there are things more important in his life than you are.|`|AA12040539	Sounds quite similar to the situation I was in last year. You're with someone for a long time and you think "they're the one!" And later when you two become different people and things change, you think, "Do I want this for the rest of my life?"   You have to ask yourself that. If he's not willing to compromise, doesn't understand what your needs and wants are, then the relationship is doomed to fail, as it is already failing. You want to spend your life with people you can connect with, and the difference between you two is already very obvious and a problem. You are living a healthy life going to school and having a social life while he is a bum smoking weed all day! If he's not working and does drugs all the time, there's a good chance he's depressed, and you will only have to take care of him more and more until you practically become his mom.    These questions you're asking can only be answered by you. The true test is separation. Have a serious talk with him, expressing how you feel. If he doesn't seem to even care then the break will need to occur sooner than you thought. But once you two take time apart from each other then you will either be happier or you will miss him. Based on my experience and after reading your situation, I think you can do much better considering how much you have going for you. Once you remove yourself from the situation and can finally look in on it then you will see many things you were blind to before and you can move on with your life.|`|JHYwzWSbaa	i think this is a hard question but i can try to help.      i appreciate you don't agree with the drug taking btw!    i think that you need to ask him what he wants to do in life, if he had a job or something...the drug taking would surely decrease?    if you love him, it would be so hard to end it :| but if there was another guy who could have atleast somethings in common, it'd be a much easier relationship!    i would give him 2 weeks to sort himself out, that way it'll give you time to think and either say "yes" or simply "no"    i hope this helps.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	CHOLE,,,,THIS GUY IS A REAL LOOSER,,AND IF YOU STAY WITH HIM,,,YOU WILL,,LOOSE ALL YOUR GOOD FRIENDS,,WHILE HE DRGAGS U INTO THE GUTTER,,,HONEY,,,U SOUND LIKE U R VERY SMART,,,AND IF HIS DONE COKE,,,HIS STILL DOING IT,,ONLY THIS TIME HE WONT TELL YOU,,TILL HIS HOOKED OR IN JAIL,,,PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,,AND GIVE YOUR SELF A CHANCE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE WHO RESPECTS AND LOVES ONLY YOU,,,,,PEACE|`|WChr31Otaa	I'm sorry honey but you have to leave this guy.

Umm lets see relationships change just like people do. I mean you meet him the day you fall in love with him but as time goes on you realize that person is becoming to fade away. He's not the person you fell in love with the first time you met him. That doesn't mean you don't love him its just you were in love with the person you met the first time. I guess its like with any relationship even if its a friendship. I had a friend since the sixth grade and i loved her the time we spent together the things we did it was just amazing as soon as high school cam along everything change including her. She wasn't the person i met and that i wanted to be friends with. Also the same thing with my boyfriend the first time i met him he was a goof and thats wat made me attracted to him but as time went on he's been turning into an ***. So good luck and make sure your making the right choice i definitely agree you are better than that but sometimes us girls really do tend to over react :)
Yd7kM30naa	Seriously people on here could use some help. If you are going to try and "help" someone online. Just be nice. Well valentines day is coming up, often the guy in a relationship is the one that does something for the woman. For your situation both of you plan a very nice romantic dinner, when you are at the dinner, tell him you love him. Don't just tell him. Look him in the eyes and tell him you love him (only if you really love him) and if he really loves you, he would look you back in the eyes and tell you he loves you too. That is the real test of love.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	u r crazy just end it and move on, u both have issues.|`|Ces5k5R7aa	yeah it's the end.  he doesn't love you.|`|ApEDEz2Jaa	If you love him and he is willing to stay in the relationship, then I would try and work it out. Tell him what you said here - you were very upset, didn't think he was serious about the two of you, and very jealous. Then tell him that you love him and know that cheating is no way to keep him in your life and start from there. Promise no more cheating and stick to it! Actions speak louder than words. Good luck!|`|nYEwK5FNaa	You cheated on him. He's insecure, if you wait you don't know if he will ever trust you again 7 TIMES?! I honestly wouldn't trust you. I'm sorry you should let him go.|`|WChr31Otaa	It's the end... You are not a nice person. You give women a bad name. If you want to start feeling better about yourself let him go and start over with another guy and commit. If you can't commit stop wasting their time.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	First of all, that girl in the hotel was not just a friend. So you've both cheated on each other.

Seven times? Damn I can see once but not 7!! You love him? Wow, idk how if you cheated that many times but w/e. He was trying to just make you jealous so you can feel as he did hurt you cheated on him. It will take time, if he truly loves you he will learn to trust you again.  If not or kind of loves, he may never trust you and the relationship will lack a solid foundation.  No trust no love no honor...I say move on and learn to be faithful please.|`|htSZsds7aa	Hey, this is a lost cause...you are spoiled and want all the attention. Grow up....and I dont for a minute beleive he was at a hotel with just an old friend....open your eyes...follow the golden rule, treat other like the way you want to be treated.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	if he cheated on you then he does not need to be judging you. dump him you deserve someone better. just get over him and begin a fresh new relationship without the cheating|`|JQZzI49Paa	7 times means it probally is the end. 1 is sometimes forgivable but not 7. Break up and let him come back to you.|`|yp8NtB0faa	I cheated on my boyfriend 2 becuz of problems. breaking up everyday, hating each other but yet loving each other at the same time.  he called me names for 2 weeks.  i just let him know that i would never do it again.  it broke my heart that i did it, and i let him now that i truly do love him, but there were things we needed to work out.  Try going out and having a fun night together. go see a movie or something.  let him know that u'll always be there for him, and only him.  But if u feel u can't keep doing it then i would end it now. save both of u the heart ache.|`|cn9FRj9taa	if you didn't think he was serious with the relationship, why didn't you leave him? that would have been a better option than cheating on him.    i'm sorry dear but you can't get him to trust you unless he wants to and i don't think he's ready to do that anytime soon.    let him go, if and when he gets over your cheating and you're still available and he comes back....take him back!
S4VVE0onaa	yes and btw harsh people are usually that way because they have been in love and then hurt by the relationship. usually a harsh person does this in order to protect themselves from getting hurt again.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	yes because my uncle was like 'scrooge' and he got married and matter of fact he is happily married. he is still a little grumpy but he has soften up a little bit.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	SADLY yes....bad people get the good things in life...|`|xgJbxZgfaa	hard to say... but love can change people|`|nYEwK5FNaa	I can't understand what your saying. How old are you?|`|7fh3JCVxaa	yeah they can...doesnt mean they will treat that person right, they'll probably get pissed off with their love a lot if they arent showing the same feelings.  but if they think that person could like them back they'll treat them so special, but personally id be scared to date them incase we ever broke up.|`|MMvoS6Ysaa	anybody could no matter what ... did u expecvt Pink to fall in love n even get married?

WDs4fRoxaa	As long as you have a court order for visitation,  she can not decide anything.    The court decided.    Tell her that you will be at her home  to get the child on your days, or she  will have the police knock on her door.    She can comply with the court order  or she can be served by the court for  violating the court order.    Best wishes    BTW: You can have your attorney send her a letter  telling her that she has to notify the court of her  new address & that any attempts to interfere with  the visitation order will be cause to take the matter  back into court.|`|aXYiOskmaa	she can't change the rules on her own. if you have visitation rules in place she must follow them.|`|YEV9D8Jvaa	not unless you give the courts reason. Get a lawyer.|`|kPS9Okh3aa	no she cannot legally do that...you all have joint custody and agreeing to this would be like giving her full custody and just having visitation rights...not wise and she could be just trying to make you into a negligent father so she can get full custody so that you don't have a sya in anything your child does or his care.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	A visitation schedule should have been set up through the court system. Stick with what they gave you unless she offers more than take all chances of seeing your son. I wouldn't stand for seeing my children once or twice a month.|`|v10vP5Hdaa	i relly thank you need to do to the judge and see what he or she can do................because its not only your child as well as hers and you should be able to be in his life as mush as you want to
8XKmMBU7aa	Please book today because if all may booked on that day, you may found a lot of trouble. No need to waste time. Do all works in advance.   I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	as soon as possible, if vendors will let you book a date that far out.  I would make sure to send them reminders and a save the date card as you get closer though, in 2.5 years a lot can change, places close, management changes etc.  I wouldn't put any huge deposits down at this point either, just 20-25% to hold the date.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Book the church now..    You're 30 months out, so I'd wait until 12 - 18 out months to book everything else.  With the economy the way it is, I'd hate for you to book someone (and pay a deposit)  and have them go out of business before your wedding occurs.|`|BGIsuNMTaa	My mums a wedding planner and she likes everything to be booked at least a year before otherwise it puts pressure on her. Theres no trouble booking it now and I would definatley reserve the chapel now so you get the date you want. The early bird comes first remember. Congratulations and good luck x|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Grab a copy of Modern Brides.  In the back they have a checklist of everything that needs to be done in which month.  Like the other poster said I wouldn't put any big deposits down b/c if the place closes down, you will be out that money.  Plus that's a really really long time out.    I think the earliest you can start planning is 18 months out.  Anytime further out than that is just crazy.  Styles change, what's in fashion, friendships, new places open up that you wish you had looked at before you booked, bands break up, budget concerns change.  You have no way of knowing if whoever is paying will still have their job that far about.    Even Duke Chapel which is the biggest known place to get married, they have a waiting list for weekends.  One year in advance you have to camp out to get the weekend you want.  For example, the first weekend of June you must camp out to get a weekend in June the next year.  Anyone who leaves is automatically knocked off the list.      But I don't know anything that keeps their list 2 1/2 years before the wedding.  They have no idea if they will still be doing receptions that far out.  I'd say start with the photographer and venue about a year from now-a year and 4 months from now.|`|wvhoS7WDaa	congrats dont for get to have a bachelorette party  and have some fun  bacheloretteplanners.com/|`|TjNMabEIaa	Good to book them all at the same time.  Popular venues get booked years in advance.  If you leave it too late you run the risk of not having the chapel you want or the car you want etc.|`|q8eue7CRaa	You should start ASAP - even though it's really in the future, we don't know the location so it could be a place where it's very competitive. Better to be super early on reservations than super late! You probably don't need to book the florist/cake 2.5 years early, but you should book the people/places.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	http://www.theknot.com/    I suggest using the Knot's wedding checklist.  See on the left, under "planning tools."    For a July 2011 wedding, I suggest you start planning in July 2010.  Many vendors will not accept reservations or bookings more than one year in advance.    Chapel and/or officiant should be the first thing you book.  I suggest you contact chapel and officiant immediately, to see if you can get the same day you reserved at the hotel.  Leave the rest of your planning until July 2010.|`|6kRhLbs9aa	NOW!!! bookings fill up faster then you think and you don't want to be caught at the last minute still trying to find out what to do! SO, the sooner the better...and it just makes everything else easier and more enjoyable too. God bless!|`|ZJohgu1saa	congratulations!!!!! xxx|`|0TEvBSQyaa	That ages away!  Blummin' hell!|`|ySjnEla9aa	that is way in the future... if u luv ur partner i think u should make the wedding earlier. i think give it until early 2010 or it will seem very early.|`|rp46MQKeaa	Book the Church / Chapel as soon as possible.  and leave the rest until about 12 to 18 months before the wedding date.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I would just do the chapel, because otherwise things could get messed up if you aren't able to ge them both. So do that now or as early as they will let you call and find out. the other items I would start at about 1 1/2 years out. looking for items and about a year out booking them. If you find something you really like or want book it when you find it, then there will be no stress when it doesn't go your way. I attached on wedding checklist, there are tons online!|`|kc68BXwTaa	I'd say to wait a year. I'm getting married about a year before you, and I've only just booked the church.     And while a lot can change in 2.5 years, you can ask about policies for refunding deposits if the place closes (which is different than a cancellation).|`|zRil0vjhaa	You almost did things backwards but you will be ok. A really helpful site is ww.theknot.com. Build your profile and it will automatically notify you of the things you need to take care of month by month until the wedding date you put in. Congrats!|`|lsPespxWaa	BY THE TIME ARRIVES  U SHOULD TRY OTHER GOODS FIRST OTHERWISWE U WILL BE DISAPPOINTED !!  WASTE OF MONEY BELIEVE ME !|`|IIC9e3JQaa	when i started looking at venues early last year, they already had bookings for 2010 and will now have started booking for 2011    basically, if there's a venue and church you want, i'd book it as soon as you're sure - popular ones book up crazily quickly     once you've got a date and time confirmed, you can leave it til about 12 months before to do everything else :D
Lfc9Zav2aa	how about sending this question to her in letter form? At least she will know how you feel and you will know how she feels instead of having sitting around with doubt.|`|NTUr0t3haa	Unfortunately, we can't control other people's interest in us. The best thing you can do is continue to be warm and friendly; and not pushy at all. This shows her that you're a safe person and she doesn't have to keep discouraging you, which I think is the case.
swV3SIw7aa	aww thats adorable!!     ok your first question  snuggling is basically cuddling  if you dont know what that is its basically like holding each other and just   wow this is harder to explain then i though >  sorry bout that im spazzing over english hw right now >    um during the movie  put your arm around her  or (i know you dont know what it is im sorry >  hold her hand  things like that    good luck!|`|BZwJeuMGaa	well shes obviously hinting she wants you to hangout.... so ask her to come over and watch movies, watch the notebook. "snuggle"="cuddle" ... possibly kissing|`|7YTiooX5aa	Snuggle: hold her in your arms and just be there. During the movie just sit there with her in you arms and enjoy each others company. As far as asking her out romantically Hell son you already did one romantic thing and that was the rose on her bed tell me that isn't the only romantic thing you can think of.......okay how about a text that says look in your car or something like that and wherever you tell her to look have a rose with a message to it asking her out.|`|g4gWHE2Naa	DUDEEEE SHE DIGGGSSS YOU  if she doesnt bring it up again, you bring it up and just be like ''we should watch it togetherrrr''  but bewaree, the notebook is like the most chick-iest movie everrr.  snuggle, in her definition seems like just hold each other and cuddle really ;)  have fun.|`|jYUDkkH6aa	"How do i ask her out in a way thats not weird and is on the romatic side?" ------When you see each other next and your say goodbye, Give her a side hug and while your hugging her say "would you be my gf?"        "what the heck is the diffination of snuggle i mean come on?" --------Its the same as cuddling. Its sitting close, holding hands, your arm around her, embracing one another, ect...        what should i do during the movie?------Start off by holding her hand, then take your other hand and gently rub up and down her arm with your fingertips. Then if you want to get closer...put your arm around her, let her head fall on your shoulder, kiss her forehead.|`|dvX11ttNaa	Snuggle= She wants you to sit with her, maybe under a blanket, and hold her and cuddle with her. That's all.    Ask her out. But DO NOT do it by text or myspace. Ask her in person.The notebook is a sort of romantic movie. And she wants to cuddle, SHE LIKES YOU!     Just tell her you had a good time after the movie, when shes leaving, and that you would love to do it again sometime, maybe suggest that you go somewhere tommorow night?    Good luck!|`|rMeuCOtLaa	1st of all the movie the note book is the best ever     snuggle = like puttin ur arm around her and keep her in close to ur chest and hold her hand   the note book is the best romantic flim ever and bound to make a girl cry so get ready     at the end or the flim lik start off sayin i no this might be cheesy but wil u get with me yeno  make it like kinda a funny so it wont be  awkard and is cute to  love shauna x|`|UR3MjFLtaa	snuggle is like when use cuddle up together, like hold her lay together and like be romantic. the note book is a great movie. so while the movie just hole her and be nice i guess well good luck.|`|WOL61Dqkaa	first you should go with her to the movies then that's good that she wants to snuggle. She wants you to sit by her and let her put her head on your shoulder. And you guys could talk about what u like to do and what she likes to do too. And maybe next week if you guys have fun then go with her to the movies or do something else fun too.|`|H0H87FNZaa	omg! you sound like a winner for this girl  and she is showing signs that  she wants you to take it to the next   level which is asking her out.    so this saturday..   btw snuggle=cuddle... so just laydown/sitdown  close together.    and this saturday you should take it  to the next level and say these exact words  "(her name), will you be my girlfriend?"  *note* you have to make it the right  time and trust me you'll know when its  the right time.    and during the movie give her  compliments and such so she'll feel  comfratable. ((don't tell her she looks hott))!!  say cute or beautiful.  and comment her eyes.! girls love that.    so i got to go.. class  is almost over.    so good luck. hope i've helped.|`|e481d50a7228f4b7aef3883dd2ea6a91aa	Awwwww.She is sooooo into you dude.  Okay the way you should ask her out in a romantic way to me would be...When you guys are at Prom dancing. A slow song will come one and you guys HAVE to slow dance.  You should hold her close and say your having a great time and your glad you are there with her.  Then say i would love it if you and me could go on a date. I would love to showyou another great time some other time.  That might work!    Now the whole snuggle thingy, Every girl is different when it comes to snuggling. So maybe you should ask her.    Good luck!!|`|8nuwr1OAaa	hahaha....First of all just ask right over the phone. Trust me, take it from a 24 year old guy, who has been on a lot of dates, girls like when your aggressive. Just tell her, "well if your free on saturday, then u should let me take you out." If she likes you, she gonna say yes. Then when your at the movies offer her some candy, pop corn, or just something to drink, but make sure you pay for everything. When you guys are watching the movie. After you guys get all settled and actually start watching the movie, put your hand on her leg. And then things will happen from there. It doesn't mean that your gonna get laid or anything, she just might actually want to snuggle and be close to you. Which is a good way to start your relationship off. Don't try to plan things out, just let things happen. I've learned if you plan things out, nothing ever works out the way its supposed too. But at the movies, just put your hand on her leg, that all you need to do and then things may or may not escalate from there.|`|MbE7Gypvaa	If she is talking about her ex's there is something wrong there. Your a guy and she is telling you about her ex's. Maybe she is trying to use you to get to one of dem.
5oUyPxuuaa	how are you so sure that she is not his type? he might like that particular type of girl. besides you shouldn't force anyone to like you. if he likes you then he will come around.

4lL34wJnaa	That's a subject that just came up in conversation with my mother the last time I saw her.  According to TheKnot.com, you should send out invitations 6-8 weeks in advance.  My mother thought it was 4 weeks.  I told her I was planning on doing it 8 weeks in advance.  This way you have plenty of time for guests to make travel/childcare arrangements.|`|hkwBR1moaa	End of March|`|FplTPoAyaa	Now.|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	2 months before the wedding. If you have rsvp cards you would ask for those back a month before the wedding so you have enough time to get in contact with the guest that havent rsvp yet.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Now, you need to give them at least 8 weeks notice for the RSVP's.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	I'm getting married the same day as you!

fQksO6Jpaa	do the same thing just talk better and deeper and do the same things he does to you|`|lEdBY8Chaa	i would just play with him back and say you like him to and he will say i like you like that too or just ask him if he likes you|`|w5MzgS2Eaa	u got to start playing like oh im hard to get and then he go start to like u even more.
zRil0vjhaa	First, it depends on where you live to develop legal stature and the 16 yr old's parents would have to give consent and emancipate her. Second, it really doesn't matter in a marriage what anyone else thinks. The love is shared between the two people...not the rest of the world. Personally I wouldn't approve of it just off of the little information that was provided but...to each is own. Hope that helps you.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	thar is gross besides you can not marry your first cousin. here in the states. and you can go to jail for having sex with an under age girl.|`|5DJcir9saa	She's just sixteen years old  Leave her alone, they say  Separated by fools  Who don't know what love is yet  But I want you to know    If I could fly  I'd pick you up  I'd take you into the night  And show you a love  Like you've never seen, ever seen    LMAO    Unless he's Benny Mardones, he needs to stay away from the 16 year olds!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	it is illegal to marry your first cousin.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I think it's sick.  Besides the fact that they're first cousins, he's way older than her.  She's just a kid.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Holy incestuous statutory Batman!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	What country are you in?  Is it legal for first cousin's to marry there?  Is that the normal age children marry in that country?      Most of us are answering from a US perspective where it isn't legal in most states, and the parent could sue the man for rape as she's a minor.  However back in medieval times, that was perfectly normal and many countries are still operated in a rather medieval, 3rd world way.    So while most of us hold the opinion from the US, that it is wrong, illegal, causes birth defects, and he is a child molester, what's really important is the opinion of the people in your own country.|`|0Id85yiYaa	no comment|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Head hurts thinking about this, you are cousins whether its legal or not you share the same blood and thats depite the fact he is 9 years older than you, you are just a kid grow up. You wont know honest feelings until you are a lot older believe me.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Ew.|`|AA11603468	Very sad. I feel sad for the child here.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	In some countries it is normal for cousins to marry.    It is also normal for the age difference.    This tends to be prevalent in impoverished, less educated countries.    The families like to marry off the girls so they do not have to  support them.    They would rather marry them to a cousin than a stranger.    It is not anyone's place to judge, but you asked what I thought,  so I will give my opinion.    I believe that it is unfair to the 16 year old.    She is young, lacking education, and has not had an opportunity  to explore her options.    If she had exposure to other people, places, etc... She might not  want to marry her own cousin, let alone get married at such a young  age.    Since this is all she knows...and like most teens is dying to be  an adult...she is excited at the prospect.    I think that he is too mature for her, and should not take advantage   of her naivety.    Best wishes|`|JCAgvgTxaa	I think the 16-year-old's father should shoot him.  Okay, maybe not literally . . . but the 25-year-old needs to be told this is unacceptable.    He needs to wait until his bride has completed her education . . . and/or wait until she is age 18, at the very least.  Twenty-two and finished with college would be preferable.    Where are this girl's parents?  I think it is past time for them to intervene here.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It takes alot to gross me out but that certainly did it. While I am aware that laws here in the US forbid such a thing with good reasons yet they are not the be all and end all of how the world runs, I can't imagine how anyone would find that to be acceptable and be able to justify their reasoning for allowing it to go on. And while there should be tolerance for other cultures, there are certain practices and activities that should not go on because they are endangering to women and children and it's hard for people to accept them because of that. But in alot of countries, women still have no rights whatsoever and are considered men's property, and that will continue to the end of time unless those cultures are willing to adapt. This appears to be one of them, which is sad but there really isn't alot that can be done.|`|w1necKzYaa	that is illegal you cannot marry your first cousin for one and you cannot marry a 16 year old! it is illegal and immoral!|`|di6p10Ifaa	Do they live in the swamps or something..wtf|`|9hPnvmuzaa	Ugh!|`|8NgbQNSMaa	wow .   that's kinda weird .  but heyy . it's whatever .|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	Weird !!! she is only 16......

Tell him when he is done with this foolishness with her then come talk to you.

It's not fair to you to suffer because of something that is (or should be) over.    You have every right to make him choose. Hey may leave you, and if that's the case you're much better off without him. There are few guys that I know of capable of getting along with exes, and there are always feelings left after a long relationship.     It's very likely that he still has feelings for her, and you can't change that, and shouldn't leave him because of it. But you shouldn't be someone who values a memory, a ghost, over you because there are lots of people who wouldn't. Hope this helps :)
5oUyPxuuaa	no. it would be against the law for them to do that. I kind of think that the guy that makes money got a restraining order against the other guy. otherwise the court would tell him to get another paternity test since they are not always exact.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Well I know for a fact that police offers lie (on the stand) and prosecutors lie and do illegal things (they can not be held liable) so maybe the court did lie or made a mistake and won't fess up (confused the tests).      There is nothing they can do if he pays for another DNA test from an independent lab (in the meantime he needs to comply with the court order.  Also proof (written or a tape of a conversation) of the threat from the court needs to be kept.  Looks are not always the best way to tell who the daddy is.|`|WDs4fRoxaa	The courts are not allowed to tamper with such evidence.    Some people are not above switching things around for   money....    That being said...it sounds strange that a court would threaten a defendant for asking for, or obtaining a second test.

If they conflict, then take it back to court.|`|8FO52r0Maa	no, why on earth would they lie, it's illegal for one, and they have no motive to do it.  If the rich guy is so up in arms over it, he can have an independent test done, but it's going to be the same result|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Is this story even true?    But if it is it is illegal and tell him to seek a attorney|`|j7l9gavRaa	they can't do that it's highly illegal  besides do you think the court really cares if the baby is well taken care of?? no|`|81wvN8Rraa	Nope they have nothing to gain by lying. It is what it is. If everyone wanted retests then they would end up doing lots of testing for no reason.|`|AWb0L9IKaa	Its definitely illegal.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	lol.... seeems you know someone ...BABY ...its all about WHO ya know ...isn't it?   ha ha ha !|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. They aren't allowed to do that. They are refusing to let him probably because they know he doesn't want to pay child support and he is just being irresponsible.  Honestly, looks have little to do with it. Babies don't really look like any one. Their looks change so much and so fast.
IPS3hWweaa	He just wanted to know if you were doing okay without him. Deep down he was hoping you would have said no and that you missed him.    Unless of course he really wants you to be happy, but a guy who wishes that for an ex is really rare.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	It sort of a feeler question because we have interest. That means we are happy at the moment and we need to know how your feeling.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	so he could see if u would like him to ask you out i think|`|D6nu55wlaa	We want you to not be happy unless you are with us... we want you to show doubt in your current situation so we can fix it.    .... let me rephrase we don't want you to be unhappy... i guess we just want you to need us...|`|HfTbzv32aa	it sounds like he wants to know if you are alright just being friends with you.|`|Me6WL4dSaa	he wants 2 have sex with you.yipee..he wants 2 bang u hard...he is horny|`|AA11886887	He wanted to see if you missed him. That is kind of an open ended question. You basically told him that you were happy with where your life is and dont need him.|`|yPU75DdIaa	he wants you back if your happy without him he has no real reason to be in your life        that's how the male mind works|`|wtUsM5S6aa	did he asked u that "were u happy the days when you were not with me ?"  If yes,  then according to me if i loved a girl and broke her up with some kinda reason and then met her again after a long time then i'll ask for the same cause i loved her a lot and wanna compare the feelings and condition of my heart with hers.|`|d2pfnZR3aa	Easy, he asks so if he would be able to make you happy,   That guy wants to get back together again.    Give em another chance would ya?    Hope it helps|`|f1a5be9d7db90382ca2d7c30b5d37f71aa	Us guys normally mean just what we said, no more, no less. Were you happy ?    Other then this, it depends on the person (you know him, I do not but...)  Is he shy ? Perhaps he did not finish is phrase has he thought it like : Are you happy right now., or... and we can go on for days.    Keep it simple : If you are interested, ask him ! If not, don't.    Just by using body language you can read people, or get read... Have a hoot.    Daniel|`|F0LgeWs5aa	My wife always says we  "guys" try to jump in and fix things while women talk and rationalize things. You may have said something to spark what he could do to fix you... or fix something in your life?  think about your conversation and what point he asked that question.    Why did you break up? reluctantly or REGRETTABLY.  Has he been waiting around for 5 years for you to get "happy"?  If so Marry him....   PS we met in 86 and married in 91. You both had time to get whatever out of your systems by now.  Good Luck God Bless

f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	Why would you ask this question?|`|saUmiEogaa	I don't need anything from you|`|IPS3hWweaa	I'm leaving! And I'm not talking to you ever again!|`|BuOHv2XKaa	"Im gay!"|`|tcPaHzkUaa	I **** on the carpet.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i hate you  i wish you were dead.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	Never tell them you hate them.  Hate is such a strong word, you should never use it with anyone.  Your parents have a hard job of raising kid(s) - its really hard on them even though it sometimes looks like they have the easy job.  They don't - its hard to be a parent.  So, when you disagree, say "I'm angry" or "This doesnt feel fair" but don't resort to hate words.|`|qccAwCoUaa	I'm pregnant|`|TBZNbhlNaa	i fu**ed my sister|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	i hate you.  that's the absolute worst.  i said that once when i was a teen out of anger. i really never hated my parents, but 15 years later i still very extremely guilty and feel like i'm going to hell for it.  i jus tremember the look on my mom's face when i saw that and i'll never forget it and can't forgive myself for it.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	If female "I am Pregnant"    If male "I got a girl pregnant"|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	don't ever speak to me again.  i can handle everything if they will talk to me but to have one of my children say that would be heartbreaking.|`|MOALoKWdaa	your not my parents and cant tell me what to do....or.....i just want to fukken kill you, you dont mean shiiiit to me.|`|Li9oemwqaa	the worst thing would be to say i wish you had given me up for adoption  or that i hate you{and actually mean it}|`|ecNeN0staa	I wish I had different parents!

amDYXKPCaa	To be honest, I don't think he's going to kiss you.   I say this, because he's in a crowed room, with chaperone's, and other kids, and it's a little embarrassing. I deff can give you some tips.  Go with the flow. If he sticks his tongue in your mouth, it's called a french kiss.|`|rMeuCOtLaa	dont bang heads i did       it hurt     but was funny i still look back and laugh x|`|9qlpqEFKaa	as you said; go with the flow! don't do anything you're not comfortable with and just be yourself!    hope you have fun! x|`|aSqkevUOaa	Like you said, go with the flow :)  i know alot of people tend to think its all involved with tounges or whatever.  its about passion, wait to see what his move is first.    hehe, i think this is cute.  wish i was 13 again :(|`|d2pfnZR3aa	Everything will come natural, I promise. Once your lips touch , your feelings will take over. Don't over think it, just kiss.    Hope it helps|`|OhqIUc7waa	I think he might be trying to find out if your interested and if he is going to walk up and try to kiss you he wouldn't want to be embarrassed if you said no ...so he might be trying to find out! The part about not going out...maybe he wants to go out with you but he isn't quite sure if you like him.     Tips: Don't wear slimy lip gloss, erghhh!           Let him lead. Whichever side he moves his head to move it the other way.        and just be yourself and relax!     Good luck :) x|`|qfqBB6RTaa	i guess to try to relax, and like u said go with the flow,heres a website that might help:    http://www.myjellybean.com/guys/flirting...  does this help?
OG4410bdaa	that's an odd situation  you would think she would appreciate having another adult who cared so much for her son in his life....I mean, your significant other could have decided to date women who treated his son poorly but instead the little boy lucked out and got you, a nice lady    my father and mother divorced when I was 1  and my father took majority custody of me  he never re-married  however he has had the same girl friend for almost 16 years now  she stayed at home with me while my father worked  she raised me  and as far back as I can remember, she was the only one of my "parents" who attended any of my doctor appointments  -my father and mother were never there-  of course, there were some legal complications  but they got a court-signed document which allowed her to make medical decisions for me at doctor's appointments, dispite the fact that she and my father never married, therefore she otherwise had no legal rights over me|`|Syn2MwSHaa	dont know answer about dr appt but if you love him do what you can mildred is my leader|`|dhhzQkzFaa	I would let her know that it is important for everybody to be there because of his special needs.  Both you and her boyfriend are around the child and it would be benefit the child for everybody to be involved in the appointments.  My son is ADHD and Bipolar and has to see the doctor every other month regarding his medication.  I am divorced from his father and remarried.  He is also remarried and we all participate in the appointments.  Not only the medical appointments, but also any conferences with the teacher or counselor.  I think it benefits my son if we are all on the same page.  I would also have a woman to woman talk with her letting her know that you would never try to take her place as a mother and only want what is best for the child.      Good luck to you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Wow. If he thought she was,"inappropriate as a mother," or, in proper English, a bad mother, he really should have used better birth control.    If she likes to fight about everything, well, that leaves you two options. Fight about everything or pick your battles. Is it really important that you be at his doctor's appointments if your SO is? Not really. He can easily tell you what happens.    I wouldn't find it necessary to fight. I also think it's a bit much for four adults to accompany this child to the doctor.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	You are not the parent so therefore are declared a legal stranger under the law. Harsh as it may sound, you have no rights to this child just because Dad would like you to.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You can go, but you will have to wait in the waiting room.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I am not sure exactly, BUT I do know a when married the step parent can add the child to health insurance. So, I would think this would entitle the step parent to take the child to the doctor.    My husband is not my son's father but he has taken him to many appts.
7aIWb0elaa	ya girl but going for an older guy might be your best bet. you are bound to have more intelligent conversations, a guy who understands and sympathizes, and be able to relate to him more age-wise. sorry girl just telling ya what i think about this. do what you feel is right though.      P.S. moms never always know best! so whatever your mom says toss it out the window. if i were still listening to my mom up to this day i'd be at home all the time wrestling with that damn dog and making slam dunks into the trash with those empty beer cans of hers!|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Well, it's not a bad thing but you do know that guys mature slower than girls right?  He's not going to be your equal when it comes to mature things.  You need a guy who is older than you to get the same insight as he has.  There is nothing wrong with you liking a guy a couple years younger than you but remember, you're going to have a kid on your hands.  You're going to be fighting his childish ways.  I'm a man who has been there done that.  I didn't mature until I was in my early 20s.  Now I'm 51 and I can look back and see how childish I really was.  If you think you can cope with these things then go for it.  You're going to have to act a little like his mother though.  Legality is a small part of it.  It would be a lot worse if your ages were reversed.  Don't have sex with him or it might fall into the legal lines.  Nothing says you can't be boyfriend and girlfriend just stay out of his pants and keep him out of yours at least for the time being.  Enjoy learning about each other before you take it to the next level.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|UX3xmWc6aa	i know this girl who is a senior and her boyfriend is a freshman.. and shes preggo.. so i guess its not that bad|`|yFeOTk3Baa	It is legal. Seniors dating freshman is the new thing at my school. It's ok. But think about him. You are leaving at the end of the year. He is stuck at school without you. Just leave him, unless you are crazy in love. But don't just be in love with his hotness. Get to know him first.
U3bGuLPraa	it may have something to do on how you carry your self. start to love yourself by building your personality with great values is definitely will lead you in finding your match. Just have to believe in yourself.|`|DiaXZSwEaa	some look for love ,fun,and smartness are some look for just sexy ones  there all different and u cant tell just by there face get to no them|`|FPqbDaKkaa	i like the girls who like me or personality|`|y6HmMl9naa	I like girls that are hot JK honest and open!!!!!!!!!!|`|D4QZkQsbaa	It varies widely depending upon the nature /character of the boy.  Some want sex, some want company , some want friendship etc.  Choose the boy correctly through friendship/courtship without sexual involvement as the girls suffer in such sexual act. If you feel that the boy loves you then enjoy joint life with whatever way you like.  Best of Luck in finding true life partner.
7LTvPIbOaa	Don't worry....Hers is coming.  I was in a similar situation with an ex...Her life went very quickly downhill..............|`|c5UAa65qaa	I think you should wish them all the happiness they deserve (you don't have to let them know what you think that is) and find someone who has never heard of this guy and doesn't care to make his acquaintance.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Be glad you are rid of her.  If she ever gets married, she will continue to cheat and I see many marriages in her future.|`|NTUr0t3haa	It sounds like you get involved with chaotic situations and people. You're better off without this girl. Now try to meet people who are stable.|`|rJq8TxHGaa	That girl sounds like a psycho and doesn't know what she's doing. Just ignore her and get on with your life - avoid her drama asap.|`|DeRRNCvnaa	wow, she moves on Pretty quickly.     anywho, keep dating, just because one jerk is taking all you ex's doesnt mean you cant have a love life!|`|2QFe7onpaa	Ditch the girl. Ditch the guy. Surround yourself with people who aren't flakes and jerks. Sounds like she doesn't know what she wants and this will probably end soon too.|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	She's a hole|`|DiaXZSwEaa	i think she is a dumbass she hasnt had time to even fall in love  with the guy and she will learn her lesson real soon|`|zMRElJS0aa	Sounds kinda slutty.|`|iNQK27Qqaa	she sounds like a rake, seriously sounds like she is to busy to think about what she is doing. Move on and don't look back|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	She sounds desperate.  Forget about her.  Forget about him too.  Any 'friend' who repeatedly steals your serious girlfriends is not a quality friend.    Sometimes people with low self esteem swing rapidly from one relationship to another.  The fact that she got engaged so quickly shows that she was trolling for a husband.  Relationships that develop so quickly generally don't last.    Set your expectations higher for the next relationship. Look past the initial good feeling and examine character.  It is character that counts in the long run.    Good Luck to you.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	I would think she is a very young and immature. Probably in her early 20's. Most chicks that age are into weddings and fantasy. She will either end it or get married and have a quick divorce. I would stay away.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	She is a floozy, a real ho! She is the type of woman that you don't want to marry. Be greatful you were not married to her.|`|NEfezEUQaa	it might just be me being paranoia, but this guy seems like he's out to get you.  try finding a more faithful girl.  sorry though, that's pretty tough.  God bless|`|KIVJ9O4Faa	she doesnt know what she is doing.  she is just going around and picking up guys.  shes not really in love with anyone.  i would say you dont need someone like that.|`|N4LKnCiTaa	Thank god, you're ok.|`|3PFJGzzsaa	you are better off without her.|`|iJZyrk1daa	They deserve each other. Move on. She and the other guy are not worth the time spent asking this question.|`|xiktW6dYaa	Whoa.. My heart goes out to you man.. I know pain sucks, but time heals every wound!    On that note, find people outside of your usual circle of people.  Find someone who is trustworthy! Because with out real trust, there is no relationship.    Keep searching for a real girl, not high school drama girls.|`|ePoyDdRGaa	hello x    she was proberly cheating on you !    You could proberly do so much better than a girl who thought it would be ok to go behind someones back and chrush them like that.      jess x
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	She can't do that.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Trust me--doing her dirty work will not endear you to EITHER one.  Haven't you heard the cliche "don't shoot the messenger"?  It became a cliche b/c most messengers are killed.    I had two friends that did this.  The guy David was engaged.  The girl K was his exgirlfriend in a multi-year on again off again relationship, mostly off.  The first time she met the wife to be, she mentioned some inappropriate things that started with When David and I were dating....    David did not want K invited to his wedding.  He had his best friend tell her this.  She of course thought the best friend was lying and hasn't spoken to him again.  They had a huge fight over it.  It destroyed their friendship.    I would not have told this girl that your bride did not want her there.  Her wedding, her invite dis, her problem.  As to the girl refusing to come to events, she shouldn't be invited to them.  It is incredibly tacky to invite someone to showers who is not invited to the wedding.  It is crass, insensitive, rude, coarse, and ill-bred to invite her to the events in the first place.  "Oh I don't want you to actually COME to my wedding but do come to events where you can buy me gifts!"    Next time the bride does this, explain to her that as her friend you need to advise her on proper etiquette and if she decides to be so offensive, she will have to do it herself.  You should be pissed.  Do not lie to your friend.  Tell her you've been at events.  You don't want to ruin a friendship for this bride.  It would be an extreme betrayal to lie to your friend.  If it were me, I'd tell her you feel for her and that the bride is acting a little $ itty.  That being the case, to make peace try to tell her that every bride acts a little crazy and to try to cut her some slack so that everyone can just get along.    Don't expect these two to be friends in the future though.|`|nqINitkmaa	Doing what she did on facebook was poor taste. I don't think it was nessasary to tell the girl she wasn't invited, if she didn't want her there then she just shouldn't send an invitation. Maybe she is just trying to cut back on her guest list. Maybe it still wasn't the right thing to do, but in the end it's still her wedding, and there isn't much anyone can do about. Of course if it bothers you that much you can always pull out of the wedding.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I would make her do the dirty work. And I dont blame the girl for not coming to events. That is hurtful to be invited, then uninvited. The bride owes her an invite or apology.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if the invitations have already gone out and the bride doesn't have the nerve or spine to tell someone they can't come after they have already received the invitation then it's NOT your responsibility to tell someone they can't come.  Let the girl show up and if it ticks the bride off then too bad, she shouldn't have invited her to start with.    if the girl did not receive an invitation after getting a verbal invite, then she knows she wasn't invited.  she's an adult and she either already knows she is not a friend to the bride or she has suspected.    she'll probably be hurt but she shouldn't hold it against you or her other friends for going.      that being said, if you feel the bride has unjustly or unfairly singled out someone from your mutual group then it's your responsibility to either call it to the bride's attention or to withdraw from the wedding in protest.  If you can't do either thing then you just let it go.    fwiw:  if I were in your place.  I'd drop the bride as a friend and I might not wait until after the wedding to do it.|`|wvhoS7WDaa	call them and tell them that is the only way|`|zdpp7cubaa	Just out of curiosity why are you friends with such a person? You can't just invite someone, then not invite them, then on top of it make someone else tell the person they cannot attend. I would cut my friendship with the bride.|`|ApHLa19Faa	How old is this bride? She sounds like an immature high school kid.    I wouldn't do any more of her dirty work. In fact, I'd probably not go to the wedding myself.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Don't put yourself in the middle by having to do the nasty uninviting. She should be doing that. Yikes!|`|w1necKzYaa	To bad it is her wedding she can do whatever she wants to do! if some people are uninvited make her do it next time! you should not have done it in the first place if you did not feel comfortable doing it!|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Maybe the best message this lazy, rude bride could get would be for Everyone to uninvite themselves, and not show up for any events. It is relativey obvious she really has NO interest in it herself, and it is her wedding, so why should anyone else be all that interested in attending?|`|sLLgERQWaa	The maid of honor has official 'duties'....giving invited guests "the ax " is NOT one of them.    Besides being lazy, this bride to be is a dyed in the wool coward who expects others to do her dirty work.    Now, on a gentler note, a guest who is not longer a guest is under no obligation to attend any pre-wedding activities, nor is obligated in any way to send a gift, card, or even acknowledge the wedding day. If she chooses to avoid social situations where the bride will be present, that is her right as well.    I would grit my teeth, go thru with your MOH status, then drop this gal like one hot 'po-ta-tah'...she sounds like a lot of future trouble...we already know she's Today's trouble....good luck 'cause you'll need it.|`|Muoe8lQtaa	wow, that is not right how can you just invite someone and then take it back.  yo, that is crap. N-E-Ways stop doing the dirty work 4 her.|`|swg3BhLXaa	Whether people like it or not, the bride has the right to invite or un-invite (as rude as it may be) whomever she feels like. It's her wedding.    The best thing for you to do is to be honest with both parties. Don't try to cover anything up or make excuses. It stinks that you're the one delivering the message, but since the other girl is your friend, explain it lovingly and reassure her that regardless of what the bride is doing, it will NOT affect your friendship with her.   Be truthful with the bride also. Let her know that she has put you in a bad situation and that a true friend would not do something like that. Let her know that you delivered her message, but that you are not willing to give up your friendship with the other girl involved.     Stay as neutral as possible and try to maintain both friendships to the best of your ability. Unfortunately, the bride isn't seeming like a very nice person, but sometimes wedding stress can cause people to act in ways that they wouldn't normally. If time does not heal the wounds, and if the friendships become threatened, you may all need to get together and talk ... and then you can make a decision about whom you will remain friends with from there.
vUVxS9Xhaa	Tell her to go to hell.     Its one thing if she was honest and said its not working. Its another thing if she lied to you and went behind your back.    It says something about her character and that tells you you dont need her...if you get back with her and things work out then you get married and have kids only to discover she is cheating on you, you will be majorly screwed.    So the short answer...tell her to "Go to hell"|`|Slr6jtMGaa	i don't think you should trust her.....i mean.....she cheated on you....and i think.....once a cheater, always a cheater....    I wouldn't move for a cheater....find someone you can trust....|`|e63a8fb9a03fd0e479ab6fa5243f99e7aa	You tried it didn't work. I think after cheating it can be quite difficult to regain that trust back. Plus you have responsibilities where you are currently. I would say its time to cut your losses and just write this off this relationship. But hey its easier from the outside looking in...so ultimately its ur decision.|`|lS32BUy8aa	My answer may not be conventional but here goes. You both cheated. You have that in common. You don't appear to be serious at all in your relationship. Another thing in common. She moved, you got a steady place and job. So by the looks of it, if u try long distance again i think u'd both be cheating again. I'd recommend she moves to you. Maybe the committed lifestyle is just not yours, ever asked her that? Hey some people are swingers. Find a common ground, but i don't think commitment is for either of you. (so find another reason to stay together)
yfPu5pcZaa	It depends on your age. If you're like 13-14 then forget it but the same happened with me, kinda. I got together with my boyfriend and then he moved for school. We stayed together and it's been working well. You can visit each other and take trips together whenever possible. If you guys truly have feelings for each other then nothing should get between you two. And no this doesn't mean you have to be "in love", you can have feeling for a person without being in love. Anyway it'll be fine.|`|y1TDricRaa	the only thing you can do is just talk to him about it. And myabe compromise|`|Q27cXlGbaa	i think it would be too soon to just go with him. id let him go and just start talking to him and if you think hes really worth it then go.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Just stay friends. Do not ever follow a guy. Follow your own dreams. He doesn't care that much about you or he would stay. You've only been dating a little while. Not like you've been together for years or anything. I would say let him go.|`|UX3xmWc6aa	cry|`|CUBKOchYaa	its hard to determine that, if you love him and you know you do with no doubts...then why not go with him? If theres something holding you back, and if its something worth staying for, then maybe you all could try a long distance relationship for a while and if that doesnt work out then you'll have to end up either just being friends or moving there. Decide what you want, if you want him, or if you have bigger and better plans you need to pursue. You'll find someone else if you  let this guy go, no doubt about that, but it will hurt for a while, it always does. But, if its the right thing to do for you, what else can be done?|`|lbHIJxYqaa	I would say that you shouldn't move with him cuz if it ended badly, sucks to be you. I think you should be friends, enjoy him while he's with you, and keep in touch after he moves buy don't do anything crazy.|`|QAccD2Mxaa	Go with him ! not yet ..moving and a new relationship can be stressfull.you dont want him to be all like i need space ,i just moved here and i dont think this is good for me right now.Do your own thing and keep intouch and see where things go.I mean if its meant to be it willl happen.|`|bIxZiOaxaa	it depends why he is moving...and also if he doesn't ask you to come will you be upset?|`|y2nC8BUGaa	long distance relationships don't really work out for long periods of time, especially if you've only been dating a short time before the distance comes between you.  If you decide that you really want a relationship, go into it with the assumption that it's short term and don't get too wrapped up in it.  Just enjoy the time together then let it go.  If you think you can't handle that then just stay friends.|`|cdf3e1235bb8fdfcc5571d382014cebfaa	Follow your heart.
REoNMbanaa	I think that maybe you two could take a break. In 5 months, when he comes back, if he's a changed person, maybe taking a break was a good idea because then you can decide whether you still want to be with him.   Ask him what he thinks you two should do, and together you can work something out.
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	You have to determine how important your friendship is. Do you want to potentially ruin a friendship? Most times after going out with someone and you break up, it's very hard to be friends. Do you think that you guys can make it work? You have to think about what's most important, a relationship with this guy or your friendship? If the friendship isnt that important then go for it! But if the friendship is important then I suggest letting it go. And please please dont do that friends with benefits thing, because that only works if you dont have real feelings for the person because you will be upset when you see him with someone else and that will REALLY mess up the friendship and the relationship.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	No.I have higher standards then that.Also I wouldn't want to ruin our friendship if we didn't work out.|`|zUZRPmYAaa	Well, it will ruin the friendship, trust me, it happened to me. The up side is that is may lead to a great romantic relationship. Can you talk to him about it?|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	yes i think you should go for it   answer mine please when you pass by it|`|AA10451868	DONT CROSS THE LINE|`|XnS9mbixaa	yes. im dating one of my best guy friends.   If you want to go out with him tell him ahead of time that in case you break up you always just want to be his friend. no matter what!|`|X1YVUA5oaa	I'd go for it, the whole "don't date your friends" thing is stupid. You're friends because you get along well, which is what you need in someone you date! Don't listen to the people that are telling you not too, would you rather date some loser that you just met, that might just be using you, or date someone that you already know cares about you and will probably treat you like a queen.|`|tXXie5yqaa	Friends?????|`|qfqBB6RTaa	well it can ruin ur friendship if it doesnt work out.Maybe u should try it out|`|JpCy1hs1aa	go for it, i'm dating my best friend right now,( and she was my best friend before we was dating)|`|VtkEdNV4aa	go for it anything that makes you happy|`|IrMMqn95aa	from my experience i would not do it. What happened to me was we were best friends and everything but he fell in love with me way to fast and it was not good i never really had the feeling for him like that because we were friends for so long.
zUZRPmYAaa	Its natural, she shouldn't be mad, that is what happens|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Girls need to understand that guys can get an erection from just about anything.  We don't ask for them.  We don't force ourselves to get them.  They just happen as an involuntary response.  You need to try to explain that to your friend.  She is a girl and you are a guy and if she's is trying to act like there's not a difference in gender, she's stupid.  When I was younger I got so tired of girls who thought I should look at them as one of the guys, of course they wanted to be treated as a girl, just wanted me to pretend they didn't have female bodies that I might be slightly attracted to, even if I didn't want to date them.|`|iAGR2jB5aa	Just explain yourself and tell her how it really came up.|`|WEVDdBYmaa	Just try to pull it off as a compliment.. Say she has a smoking hot body, or try to make it funny... You hugged me to hard and the blood had no where else to go or something..|`|OYzPApodaa	Be honest, apologize  Then tell her a funny antidote about another strange time you got an erection.  for instance in your sleep  or well, your a guy, im sure you have a dozen such stories  after being serious during the apology/ explanation  try to joke about it ya know, make it clear you meant no insult  good luck and try to keep that lil puppy down ;D
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	You are both still very young, and have alot of growing up to do.  You mention going to college - you both will change alot while in college, trust me.  If you love each other, continue the relationship and see what happens in the next few years.  Keep your eyes and your heart open, and always be true to yourself.  If you find yourself trying to change who you are in order to keep the relationship, it's time to move on.  Don't hold yourself back - let yourself grow and become the person you are meant to be.  If you try to change yourself to be what he wants, you'll only end up resenting him in the end.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	yopu're still way to youngto get married,you should try moving together first before making that commitment...Im n ot doubting your love for eac other,but theres just as much happiness whether you're married or not.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Playful kidding or teasing with friends is different than the teasing between couples in a relationship.  You really don't care what cousin John says but if the bf says the same thing it goes deeper.  One playful comment sets the tone for an argument or fight.  Encouragement on the other hand sets the tone for agreement and ends in a hug.    Tell him that you don't like getting picked on.  If he can't say something nice don't say anything.  You have to set your boundaries if you want to stay together.|`|y1TDricRaa	if you plan on marry someone you have to be comfortable enough to talk to the person about anything even this.  guess it's another way of knowing if he really is the one.|`|MYbRICxqaa	Well, for me your boyfriend is showing his age. You are going to really have to work to make this relationship work. Also, do you really want to be with him all through college? Do you feel he is it for you?|`|fYT2kOhqaa	I fully believe in living together before marriage, that way you can see how you do living close together and seeing each other all the time.
TqWXXZ34aa	Meaning that they really have NOT had sex yet. Sex feels different for everyone. You can't explain it. There aren't words to describe it. If you had, had sex how would you define it?
4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	First off, why are you planning to marry this guy?  You are already aware that the guy's abusive, and you still want to marry him?  Please don't get into the "I want my baby to have a father" argument here.  He is the baby's father, whether you are married to him or not.  If you have any illusions that marrying him will make things better, your are mistaken, big time.  Plan on the abuse to escalate once he feels "trapped."    Secondly, get yourself to your doctor!  Your body is telling you that something is not right.  Don't ignore it and get in to see him / her immediately, if not sooner!  After you had your baby, there are any number of things that could have happened in your body that were not right.      Take care of yourself first so you can better take care of your baby.  Leave the fiancee by the roadside where he belongs.|`|AA10986891	Sounds like you have a iron deficiency in your blood. Smoking is not making it better, neither is your that thing* you are goign to marry constant abuse.     You really need to get away from that thing* (you call a fiancee) and get some rest and peace. A baby is a full time job and the stress that thing* is putting you through is goign to take you pretty soon to your breaking point and destroy you.      LOVE IS NOT ABUSE. There is always a way out.|`|FzFSzilmaa	why are you marrying the jerk??? get out of that relationship!!! :D|`|JaNE0HKyaa	Go stay with your parents if you can and don't marry him if things are bad now just wait they will get worse.|`|Pm39EfVWaa	eat more. take the baby and dont marry the idiot. stop smoking to|`|5IkZ64aFaa	Nobody deserves to be hurt, physically, mentally, or verbally.  There are many places that can help you.  You might try calling a domestic violence hotline  (888) 743-5754). They won't just tell you to leave him.  It also sounds like you aren't taking care of yourself if you're not eating and smoking.  If you don't feel well physically, it's going to be tough to take care of your 3 month old.  Take yourself to the doctor and get checked out.  Who do you have in your life to talk to....friends, family?? If you need someone to talk to about your situation, you can call 1-800-448-3000.  It's a crisis line and they have trained counselors that are avail. 24/7.  There is help out there, you don't have to go through this alone.  Counselor KB|`|ATKpIJUzaa	First of all if you are being abused in any kind of way you need to get out of that situation NOW...ask yourself this "Do I really want my son to grow up in this environment?"  My guess would be no, because what mother would. You have to think if he is abusive to you what makes you think he won't do the same to the baby.  Please just leave him.    As for the other issue you are having it sounds like your iron may be low. Take your prenatal pills and eat lots of food that are high in iron.  You also may be feeling weak and dizzy because of the simple fact that you are not eating very well.  I know its hard to get a good meal in with a baby, but eat small things (sandwiches, crackers, fruit).  You have to eat to keep your body healthy and so you can be strong for your baby.  I smoked with all three of my kids so I can't tell you to quit but I'm sure you know the risks of cigarettes.  If you can try to quit.  I've been trying for quite some time now.    I hope that everything works out for you.  And please don't let him abuse you any more.  If you think you love him and want to work it out then you should see about seeing a marriage counselor before getting married.
dw440Lylaa	Start by introducing yourself    Ask her about what she likes, her hopes and dreams.  You'll find out soon enough if the two of you are compatible, but you have to talk with her, not just dream about her.    How can you have a "crush" on someone you know nothing about?    Sounds more like lust, or infatuation.    Luck|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	ask her if she haveing a nice day .. then ask if she doing anything to night  if not then ask her out ..good luck|`|Fex51ntIaa	Say something funny.|`|aGno0HAwaa	Start with a "hi" I am struggling to talk to my own guy first of all. If it rains heavily one day, it means me and my guy approached each other. Good luck to you.|`|xqan4ChSaa	um well u cud just tell your name first and then you cud ask her name and then just say what you want 2 really do when your out of the company and just say an easy conversation thats all u have to do|`|cr8J3hPqaa	I agree with what Sophie said. Make a witty observation, make fun of someone, there's always some idiot to make fun off, like another worker, or your boss.     Tease her, use sarcasm, be cocky &  funny.    Whatever you do, stay away from complementing her, you can do that later after are in a relationship with her, not at the beginning, thats just creepy, ask any girl, if you dont believe me...If you accidentally complement her, like you say 'you have nice eyes, or a nice a s s', redeem yourself by say 'but mine is a lot nicer' with a smile. This will get her laughing, and laughter is the key to a woman's heart, it is also the key to her sweet little panties.    Dont start by introducing yourself, thats so BORING, and a bit creepy, not to mention akward. Start with the witty obervation, make fun of her, someone, the boss, and then get into convo with her, and introduce yourself later in the conversation, when she asks, what your name?, this is good, it means she likes you, but you need to do alot more before you can get seduce her.    Dont be too eager, this is the No.1 mistake us guys make!!!, act like you dont want her, as if she is the last girl you would ever go out with, it will show in your demeanor or body language/behaviour, women have a sixth sense for this, trust me. Some days, be all 'Hey! how you doing', on other days act like you dont know her, ignore her, alternate between the two, after a week or two of doing this, tell her to 'write her number down', and take it from there my friend, btw call her 3-5days later.    If you want to know what to say on that first phone call and how to set the date, where to go [dont go for a coffee, thats what couples do, your not a couple yet], what to do, then check out my other answers|`|BUvPi5ldaa	You could trash talk the boss. Everyone loves to make fun of other people, especially those in charge of them. Perhaps do an impression of the boss of something? Get her laughing to make her feel at ease, then the conversation will flow.   =) hope this helped.|`|vWWwOmDjaa	Compliment her on something like her hair or clothes and then strike up a convo about work or something. If a guy approached me i'd want him to compliment me on something i was wearing and then i would take an interest. If you compliment her and she doesn't really seem interested then move on...she's not worth your time.  Good Luck!|`|dKCoyvMSaa	start with hi, and say something like "hey would you like to meet up sometime?" or something? i have no clue sorry|`|JHAqEETmaa	1) approach her and say "hi" with a friendly look, but CONFIDENT. you have to look absolutely confident, with a pinch of shyness. (it looks a contradiction, but with practice you'll achieve this!) don't forget the smile. (but not a stupid smile...)  2) start the conversation with a question about something she can help you with.(something about work, the company, or other subject) you have to make her believe you'll be really helped on her opinion or decision.    3) slowly start to say funny things, but don't exaggerate. (check if she laughs of your jokes.)  4) then, in the next day, ask her for a coffee or,(be a MAN!) ask her for lunch, but something simple (like a Macdonald's).  5) then ask her for her MSN address, (if you get to this point, when you're on the MSN ask her for her tel number. it's logical and natural)    After this you are on a good way.    PS - Still, it's my personal advise. It's not a thing to be considered as infallible. right?
MYbRICxqaa	Why in the hell will you ask for a box of condoms back from your ex-boyfriend? Do you actually think he still has those condoms? He probably already used them now anyway. I would just let them go. You really should not listen to me anyway. Go and ask him.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Are you sure he wouldn't be a dick and pick holes in them with a needle? I would just buy a fresh pack and have one less worry.|`|utGddhnVaa	oh man that's funny.. you should devide them up|`|Q27cXlGbaa	get them back.. would you want him to be using YOUR condoms with other girls ?|`|71vWjc8Qaa	Just leave it alone.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes as you need them dont you ..|`|nr1Bt47baa	Do you think your next boyfriend will need magnums?

I'd be scared to death that he'd poke a very small hole in them.|`|NZuJR79oaa	If you want to piss him off sure. He should give them back since they are your property, but hes gonna be pissed about it , since it implies you are planning on using them with someone else.

I agree that your ex could tamper with them and where would you be then?|`|fNNTPqZLaa	Stop buying the condoms. Let them do it.|`|gIszhbQNaa	Buy another box. This is stupid.

I will send you the money if you want    gooood luck|`|fzWuDeCsaa	I just want to put out there that it would be very awkward conversation if you asked for them back, but you also have to think that what if he uses them on some other girl so I don't know I guess you need to decide if you want them that badly or not.|`|sKsqSEqZaa	honey, leave the condoms and your dignity alone
OFJFLs2Paa	Well he pretty much did make the time to talk to you. Not making the next day where he wasn't busy. I mean you really have to give him a break he was really busy you can tell. If he didn't like you he wouldn't talk to you at all. Trust me he likes you and everything. So don't get mad just because he didn't answer a couple of times because he was busy. You have to see that he respects you by letting you sleep and not saying well you need to talk to me right now and wake up.
d0wJRB2Saa	Why don't you go out to meet them? Instead of the internet?|`|OHfZFR31aa	Dude - you are in college. You are surrounded by thousands of single women who can carry a good conversation. Get out there and meet them - bars, sports events, student clubs, etc. Take a foreign language class - the girls usually outnumber the guys by about 3-1. Or wine tasting. Or cooking. Or even salsa dancing. A male friend is taking a salsa dance class with 15 women and only 5 men.

QIQNzE11aa	I guess it would depend. Furthering a career is a worth while goal. He may make less money to begin with, but maybe more money within a few short years. Moving can be hard, but it can also be quite wonderful.    The best thing about moving, is one can always move back. Why not give it a try for a year or two? Tell him to keep his eyes open for the same type of opportunities in the state you'd prefer to live in, but for now, you could go.     My first question to him would be this. How set is he on going and furthering his career? If he's set on going, what are you set on doing? ?Would you like to try to live in other states for a period of time until other decisions can be made? Would you like to break up? Would you go if it meant being apart?     He'll resent you for the rest of your life if he isn't given this chance. Resentment will eventually lead to worse problems and possibly divorce. You'll always be the woman who killed his dreams and made him be stuck in a position he didn't want to be stuck in.     The person with the career opportunity should be able to try to reach for it. Not be held back. Best of luck.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	That wouldn't happen. My husband wouldn't apply for a job in another state, when we haven't discussed moving. We don't just up and do things that concerns us all as a family, on a whim. We discuss it long before it's a possibility.|`|b26NgqOFaa	I would sit down together and make a list of pros and cons.  Maybe there are enough good reasons that benefit everyone. Maybe there aren't.  You asked, I answered.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I would strike a deal.. I get a new car and we can move. Might as well get something to keep me smiling instead of being depressed about the move.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	You need to talk it out thoroughly and make some decisions, because this can be a deal-breaker.  Many couples endure separations for several months to do this on a trial basis (e.g. going to L.A. to try an acting career), then they re-evaluate after a certain amount of time.  Ultimately, if he's dead set on moving there, and you're dead set on staying, then you have to decide what is more important - your marriage or where you live.  We can't make that decision for you, but that's what it comes down to.|`|OBCvewW2aa	You mean someplace God-awful like South Dakota?      I'd give it a shot.

2E6fvlzSaa	i looove coffee!  i grew up with alot of people from all over the world staying at our house and something they would bring alot of was coffee..  my personal favorites are Guatemalan coffee, Colombian coffee, and Brazilian coffee. Brazilian is best with no cream, just sugar. its strong but not bitter at all.  Colombian is good no matter how you have it. As is Guatemalan|`|8u93Tcewaa	no coffee is gross|`|LTMgLRWYaa	I am a lover of coffee!      One of my favorites is Eight O'Clock Coffee.

You don't know how long ago they were roasted -- they become too stale 2 weeks after they are roasted. Or if you get roasted coffee, don't get them ground. Coffee should be used immediately after being ground.    To get the best coffees, you need to find a good vendor or farmer and buy the beans green. You can then roast them at home or find a coffee shop to roast them. You need to wait 2-3 days after roasting to use though, so they have time to bloom (release carbon dioxide). You can also make your own blends and find different kinds of roasting profiles that you really like. If you get the coffee roasted from either farmers or vendors, get the date they were roasted.    Of course you'll also need a quality burr grinder such as Capresso Infinity, Rancilio Rocky, Mazzer Mini, Baratza Maestro, or a bunch of other. It must be a burr grinder, not a blade grinder. Blade grinder creates an uneven grind, static, and heat.    As for the actual brewing method for your coffee, I would suggest against the automatic coffee drip method. They tend not to fully saturate, and waste, the beans. If you must use a drip method, use the pour over method. Some excellent brands are Chemex and Hario. Other brewing methods include a french pot/press pot, vac pot (which is actually the first method ever used to brew coffee), cold brewing, flip pot. Each method has their pros and cons.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Best coffee I ever had was called Parisienne. Two mugs of that stuff and you were awake for a fortnight.|`|YkseyT7zaa	I'm a Starbucks maker at home.

4JGTC2MHaa	Maybe she's come to her sense. You should probably listen to her just to hear what she has to say.
JlDcVTVsaa	I think she wants you, and the mp3 is an excuse to call you.    I think she wants to see if you still have feelings for her, because she is afraid that you might reject her if she asks you.    Is she still with her bf? if so i think she is afraid to break up with him, and then if you also dont want to be with her she will be alone.    if she is not with him, then it makes every thing much easier.     so now it depends on you, if you still like her and want to be with her, you can ask her some thing like, do you think you still need some more time?   and then she will tell you what she really feels.     good luck|`|SsfnitjXaa	Give her back her mp3 player.

Ive been in a realationship just like this girl you like,    The only reason why she is staying with him because she likes bad boys but she didnt know what she was getting herself into. Then when she found out she thought he was going to change but im sorry he will never change.    You like her and i can tell. It was sweet that you told her. But i have a feeling that she likes you also and the mp3 is just a cover. Youneed to invite her over sit down and talk about this with her, and if she doesnt understand or feel the same way as you, You know what to do.    Good luck hun:D
B15mdx4Paa	Marry me?? haha    I have no clue. I have a man that is like ur wife. It totally sucks! I wine him and dine him and yet I get NOTHING! I'm not boring, I will try anything but probably have already done everything. It is so frustrating!!    EDIT: I have seduced him in a bar... (I too can use my mouth quite well) BUT still NOTHING! I try the sweet approach, the rough approach, the full out bad girl approach... Nope, sex just is not that important to him :(     I have told him numerous times I got more being single (u think that would wake him up) *shakes head*... I don't know... I'm not married to him so my out is easier than urs. I'm hopeful things may change but if not I am capable of leaving. What bothers me the most is the fact that I think it's me, that he's not attracted. He tells me he is but still it has totally put a damper on my self esteem. I'm begining to think I do expect to much from the male race.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	souns like she is bored with the same old thing. i was liekthis to not long ago. but westrated trying it in new places and i love the excitement of us being able to be caught at any moment, brought spice back to it. also try using toys!|`|jCMSybAnaa	Sounds a little ungrateful.

Secondly, she just seems to be getting tired of how long it takes every time you have sex. Not that she doesn't enjoy it, but she'd like to spice it up every now and then with a quickie. Try that and see if she responds more to it. If not, then you have to accept that she's just not into having sex as much anymore. Women's sexual preferences do change over time, as do men's.|`|9kjpm2oQaa	Wow, I think women need more men like you! Kudos! You sound like your doing all you can.Is she on any medication? Sometimes that can curb libido. Or worse case scenario,she could be having an affair.I'm also wondering about her age, and how long you've been together. To me your doing all you can.Hope you get to the bottom of it,good luck|`|k73IxCHaaa	You my friend are the perfect example of why they say that "good guys always come out last." I'm sure that there are a lot of women out there that would appreciate you, unfortunately your wife is not one of them.    Pretty amazing you want the intimacy of a lasting love-making session and she wants a quickie. I guess everyone is different. Sorry to say, you may also have to look at the possibility that she might be hanging with a bad boy. A lot of women say they want a "nice guy", but when they get one, they have a tendency to take advantage of him.|`|jjt2enntaa	You don't mention how old she is.  Could be menopausal hormones,  or stress, or maybe you aren't turning her on enough and she is resentful...do you know where her clitoris is and how she likes it manipulated?  You may be surprised at the number of men who are clueless about this.      Or maybe she just needs some quickies for something different.|`|vFCva8R5aa	If she wants quickies than you should just give her some quickies once in a while, i don't see the problem really, women do not always need a 4 hour marathon of love making with candles and romance, sometimes we just want some sex.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	maybe she doesnt have as much hormones as she had, or she is physically not able to do it for a long time, because she gets tired quickly. (bad food, or not having exercise, might do that. it has happen to me)    i dont think you should be upset for the quickly. just tell her to tell you in the begging that this is a quickly, so you will be quick only when it is needed.     i personally love having sex with my husband, but if some times because of any reason i feel tired, but i still feel like making him happy, i will just tell him lets make it a quickly, and then we are both happy.
SJDVqxyIaa	There is not much you can do...if she is a vindictive type of person thats just who she is.     If you must You could tell her that if she does say anything that you'll sue her for slander..but assuming she has a brain she must realize that you know things about her too and revealing your secrets may cause her more harm than revenge.|`|CgP9tI5kaa	If he/she was your true friend than he/she couldn't blackmail you. He/she only want be scared you but interesed to make firendship again.|`|W5zMG97Uaa	Sounds like this so-called friendship was never meant to be, and you both deserve what's coming to you.  If y'all kept your noses clean, you might not be in this predicament...|`|KPXwwwMMaa	Firstly, if she truly is blackmailing you, then she wants you to pay her money for her silence. blackmail is illegal. If she's doing this, call the police. However, for your case, it sounds like she's just threatening to reveal all your secrets, but not asking for money (which is NOT illegal), right?     Probably the most drastic, and positive thing to do would be to let go of all your secrets that she is 'blackmailing' you for. (i.e. if you cheated on your husband a couple years ago, and your friend knows, just tell him before she has the chance to.) If you have no secrets left, your (ex) friend will have nothing to hold over you.    Secrets are a powerful and destructive thing. If you have things that you have done badly, or are ashamed of, then let people know. If you live a open and honest life, and you let people know the good and the bad, there may be pain involved at first, but they'll respect you deeper as a friend... and most importantly you'll have nothing to hide from anyone.    Since secrets can be so powerful and destructive, you might want to call a counselor or a church elder or something to ask them for help on how to eliminate all your secrets and start living an open, honest lifestyle. It won't be easy... but it will be VERY rewarding.|`|g0q6ny9qaa	well why dont you site down with your friend and tell her the truth try that it should work.
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	For a photogrpaher in NYC that includes all of that $1600 is a complete STEAL! If you've seen his work, just make sure your contract states that you do NOT pay until you get the goods (1/3 the day of, 1/3 when you get proofs, last 1/3 when you get the rest of the merch) that way you won't get screwed in that department. Also make sure he has a back up in case he is sick or has an issue come up.     Good luck!|`|cRRk00rgaa	That is a bargain.  I live in NJ and all the prices are much, much more.|`|V0A472JBaa	This is a really good deal.  I worked at a photography studio and our cheapest package started at $1500, but didn't include anywhere near that much.    Most photographers you find these days are going to charge you $2000+ and will only allow you 2 hours (That's for the wedding and the reception.)  On top of that, some photographers will then charge extra for any prints.    If you like the quality of her work, then you paid the right amount.|`|4lL34wJnaa	My photographer is costing us $2000 in CT.  That does not include any printed pictures, but we are getting all the digital negatives on DVD.  Our photographer is also giving us 30% off albums and unlimited coverage.

I break even at $3,000 - which would be the case for any full-time professional wedding photographer in a big city.    So, you are getting a great bargain.    I worry that he is actually not very good if he needs to charge so little.    Finally, taking school pictures, or being in charge of them, may indicate that he is a good businessman and very organized, but.... aren't school pictures the worst?    My friends who can't make a living photographing weddings do school photos instead.|`|pNrfE7fHaa	Man, I live in freaking Oklahoma and that is a steal for here!    Photography is expensive.

y43tzOQlaa	If you work then why can't he help? If you don't then give yourself a schedule to get a couple of things done per day. Besides that, Hell no he can't get physical in any way shape or form! Oh well you didn't get stuff done, so what! Take pictures? yes, also take your dog to the vet, they can document it as abuse so if any thing else happens there is a paper trail. As far as you being dependent on him, is that your choice?, because if it is it's is a bad one. Call a family member for help, and get out of your self shame and blame. There could possibly be some depression issues with you that you can get help for. Don't be a victim!!! Good luck.|`|HlaEUb3Uaa	you have yourself in a pretty big pickle.  Since he has laid hands on you, it is very likely he will do it again.  You have to sit down and do some serious thinking about your relationship.  Is this the only thing that angers him so much.  This is oddly something I'm very familiar with.  I am dependent on my partner also most times out of the year.  He has a steady, good income, and I take what I can get because I'm also a mother of his child.  He has frustrations with the house also.  I was lazy myself a few too many times.  He gets worked up over the home when I am not working.  I understand his view.  It is not fair for him to work all day and come home to something he is not comfortable in.  Especially when my only job was to take care of the house and the child.  If your man is usually laid back, generally sweet then I would say this is all your doing.  I needed a wake up.  A little shake and some screaming to get myself to see just what his anger was about and how he was feeling.  Men are not the greatest with their anger (I'm not making excuses for him hurting you) but you have to look at his point of view.  What do you actually do all day?  Do you accomplish anything beside logging in time with the t.v?  I'm not trying to be mean but when a man is forced to those extremes like grabbing you, maybe you should ignore the fact that he's squeezing your arm a little too tight and look at what he's trying to point out.  If this doesn't work for you, or he reared up a smacked you a good one, leave.  You have to remember there are two sides to the relationship.  Being selfish and lazy will ruin what you have because your not making an effort.  It is unavoidable, clean the damn house, then talk to him.  Give him fair warnings that he's never to touch you again, and start stashing money away just in case|`|AA10529198	Well, since you aren't clean, and you are too lazy to get a job, maybe you should just deal with a good beat-down once in a while ????    Seriously - uh, no... You should get some financial independence and then move out.  Any guy that will beat you because the house is not clean, has some serious issues.  I mean, it isn't like his dinner wasn't ready on time or something important like that... ???|`|VGij9p0Taa	You need to find the strength to leave now.   I advise you to get a job and open up a bank account in your name save until you can leave. Have you got family that can support you for a while?   Think what may happen next time their are many charities that can help you escape.   Please get a job and leave this is so sad good luck in the future.|`|AA11603468	Stop selling your life for a place to live. You need a job and money of your own. That's a sad state for a grown adult to not have anything of her own. That's your first step.     Also, if you don't work, etc, why is the house such a wreck that it causes fights? How are you spending your time?    Sorry, the whole situation is a disaster.|`|JsffWlnEaa	next time he might accidently kill you....dont you deserve better than this?...LEAVE HIM NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!!and call the police..
mxrlZEweaa	As long as it's after business hours and you just tell him you were thinking about him and wanted to say hi. But if he sounds like he needs to get off the phone then just say ok and get off. You don't want to seem to needy and pushy. Good luck with him.|`|yBuKIocraa	it depends on if he is trying to focus.  I would be pissed.  Try to find out what kind of a guy hei s.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Well, what's the harm in trying? If he hated you for wanting to get into contact with him, then I'd say the odds of it working out are low. I would certainly wait until after business hours, maybe offer to take him out for a quick dinner and catch up.|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	You said it yourself.  It's AFTER business hours.  That is very considerate not to call him during his work hour already.  If he gets annoyed by a phone call like that, I don't think you want to be with a guy like that for another 40-50 years.|`|AA11441704	yes, call and say hello..........make it short|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You need to back off because you are annoying him!|`|jPESbdyyaa	Calling him is perfectly ok!  But just call him once....don't call him over and over and over.  When he's free, he'll call you back.      Don't get too clingy -- he'll run for the hills!|`|AGbusTqGaa	That wouldn't be annoying, but you might want to ask yourself why he hasn't taken a few seconds out of his day/evening to send you a text or made a quick call just to say hey....|`|v2D4Sao5aa	honey dont beg guys are sopposed to bey for women ...you would juts sound despert just play cool with it and then he will see how much he needs you|`|7sxGW40qaa	Of course you should call him!  He would probably like it and you get to connect with him. Gently hint at Valentine's day being next weekend, and see what he does.  If he doesn't ask you out, then it is perfectly OK for you to ask him! Just go for it!|`|LyFaBLSJaa	IF... he is a nice guy, then of course it will be a wonderful treat for him im sure. :) go for it!!
Nq8fhhRPaa	I am currently doing it. Although my relationship with my husband is great I decided to do it. It has made me think a lot about how I treat him, sometimes you don't think before you speak. I am only on day 18 but I already feel an even stronger love for my husband than before. It is a great challenge, well worth it.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	What?|`|ITfBQzg6aa	It was an awesome movie i recommend it to every couple i know that is going thru a problem...|`|j7l9gavRaa	i have never heard of that|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I am starting it this saturday...not telling my husband.  We are both happy in our marriage but after having our daughter april 2008 we've lost our focus on each other.    So ask me in 40 days I'll let you know and God bless you on your journey.    Josline: I think you miss the point of the Love Dare...it's not to change your spouse...it's to change you!  Your heart and your love for your spouse.  If you go into the Dare looking to change your husband it will fail.  I will pray for you both!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I havent tried the dare but after watching the movie me and my husband did try to put some of the things in play and it has worked wonders. I think you will find it successfull. let us knwo how it goes!|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Our church is currently going through the 'fireproof your marriage' six week workshop.  I have friends that have done the love dare... all with similar results as the movie - it only worked when their hearts were really in it, which means they needed to really understand what love is.  I know one wife who did it, and two husbands.  Good results for all three.|`|81wvN8Rraa	I don't know what that is.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	I think it will only work if you have faith and  you are willing to give your entire soul to your marriage. If you will not put yourself forward than the dare wont work. My spouse and I have watched fireproof and I think it has made our marriage worse. In my eyes if my husband took the dare seriously we may have had a chance but I became more upset watching the movie knowing that sometimes those dares are unrealistic.
dbXnW5emaa	You say you want to be a psychologist.  Well, I'd say about 75% of your cases will revolve around this very thing.  Good luck figuring it out, because I don't think anyone has ever found a successful answer to it.|`|67EaIAvbaa	because they don't live by the will of Christ.|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	cuz they think they are better then you are and they dont care|`|FIvA9OVxaa	i have no idea people are messed up and i dont do that to people and they should all go live with each other and die|`|9c9kZePHaa	People are selfish, and tend to put themselves before others, sometimes without even thinking. Or they think that you can get over it quickly because that's what they would do. Especially most men who are players, they don't realize that women's feelings are fragile. It will be okay, just keep your chin up and remember that we're human, and that men are close enough.|`|ARmhMq5laa	because they're jerk offs/:|  to people like that the whole world evolves around them,we will never understand...sorry.|`|Y2sDswLBaa	Because some people are just straight up asshoels who dont care. Its a sad truth|`|4cdq26oraa	Because people are either too self-centered to care or they themselves have been wronged in some way, so they feel justified in doing it to other people.  Either way it's wrong, but you are going to find out that there are plenty of those people out there.  There are also very good people out there who once they get to know you, would do anything for you.  Trick is figuring out how to find the second set and not the first.|`|bV1cnEx6aa	Well im sorry you had to go through that. but i promise im a more better friend. I can honestly prove it to you|`|el8XHxBpaa	They only care for their self and getting what they want.  its just how some people are. As long as they are happy they don't care who they hurt.|`|fug6NLOkaa	ill be honest we never mean to hurt people its just my penis often makes my decisions, not usually the best ones either.|`|zXMs3h05aa	A true friend would never do that, he was just looking out for himself, you got used it happens sorry,  Give it time what goes around comes around.   Your feelings will fade over this matter in time.

At worst, if I was dog tired I would say:  I am kind of wiped, so tomorrow would be nicer for me, but if you want me now start getting undressed.|`|TLNQZ63baa	Send her my way, girly boy!      . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}     . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--|`|x3LclBZ0aa	consider yourself warned buddy.|`|HbaxtX44aa	my husband used to complain about that all the time.guess what he complains about now?not getting enough.guess what i take great pleasure in doing?telling him ...ya know there was a time when.....|`|MRDJu8v3aa	I am not sure what is wrong in your relationship. Why are you not interested in sex? I do not believe your "I have a headache" answer. There is something else going on in your life or in your relationship to your wife that is causing you to not want sex. Is it just not wanting sex with her in particular or is it sex in general that you are not interested in?    The two of you need to get into marriage counseling before this difference because an irreconcilable difference that leads to divorce.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Apparently, you don't beat her enough...dang modern women anyway.|`|B15mdx4Paa	Sex is the best cure for a headache :) If it's good sex it makes u completely forget u had one.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	What's really going on? Is she fat, unattractive, boring in bed, smells... what?

Everyone has different sex drives, most times I recommend you do it anyway.  THis is a team, a partnership, you have to give for the sake of giving, even when you don't feel like it.    She needs it more than you do, so give it up more for her.  What you need to do is plan a really nice night with her, light the candles, and give it to her well.  She will be so happy.  Then do that "make it special" night every month or so and you will have her making you a sandwich and giving you a beer.    The fact that she says she is going elsewhere is alarming and means that she is needing you to PAY attention to her, compliment her, make her feel loved.  Don't  be selfish or you may find yourself alone.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Well, let's see....you'd rather drink a beer and eat a sandwich than make love to your wife.  Do you see the problem??  You need some therapy.  I'd leave your sorry butt and go find me a real man too!|`|ftrKT4NVaa	i think that you should look at why you don't want to have sex with her? are you having sex with someone else? is it her, how about when you see someone else, for example at work? have you started talking to anyone online kinda thing? or is it that you don't want to have sex period? there's couple of thing that you could look into. but involve her, before she involves "someone else" if you know what i mean... talk to her.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	You need to put effort in your relationship. Otherwise you wife is going to get banged by other men. She will leave you. Get off your lazy A**  get that beer out of your hand. Get down to some pumping action.|`|vL0TQTYOaa	How would you feel if the roles were reversed? You better straighten up before she gets it somewhere else|`|lIvpmn0Jaa	your making her feel rejected  my advice you should take advantage when she wants sex  put it this way if your not giving it to her someone else will  and i know you dont want that....so give it to her and real good at that =)  well good luck and i hope you find your answer your looking for!!!|`|AA11328507	I suggest you find a way to get in the mood....|`|024910ffc7104c135d901f2da8f1011daa	Unfortunatley, you are not a compatible couple If you are completely indifferent to her sex needs, there is no any reason to stay together. I do not think that you would accept her illicit sexual activity. On other hand she is quite likely interested in sex with other men.|`|Iarvsn7yaa	You shouldn't have told her "there's the door, go and find him". That was stupid.     Do you really have a headache, or are you not just interested in sex with your wife?     Well, if you are no longer interested in sex with your wife, is there a reason behind that? You need to sit with yourself and figure this out.    Women need to feel loved. Why do you keep on putting her aside for?|`|5kIUmkz8aa	from a female point of view,,,i can somewhat relate w/you.  for your wife to say something like that, i'm sure her feelings were hurt and she wanted to hurt yours in return.  i too have said something close to that but never really want to cheat on him.  i was just hurt and that was the 1st thing that came out.  felt stupid afterwards.  for the both of us, we should of used nicer ways of wording or showing our "not 2nite honey" or "okay i see U don't want to so i'll be in the bathroom, don't be alarmed by the buzzing sound"     :)    Can i ask why U rejected her?  Maybe we can both help each other out in this area.|`|satoCRC6aa	wow, whats up with you? You could help her in her need to be close to you and not shut the door in her face.  Be kind if she stays around....|`|0Id85yiYaa	you should make a sex sandwich
UX3xmWc6aa	i don't think i would.. problems in one relationship can help another. and a perfect relationship would be boring.. very boring..     BUT if there was a button to stop you from having to cry your eyes out when you end a relationship.. i might have to use it ;)|`|BZwJeuMGaa	i honestly would ..... but then again, you would always have that weight on your shoulders telling you that you couldnt fix this yourself, you needed an easy button to do so.
k5lfyMgNaa	Build-a-Bear is great. It only asks for a minimum of 6 kids, and 7 years old is the perfect age to do it, where they will really understand what's going on and have a good time.     It only starts at 10 dollars per guest to get the 10 dollar bear, that's only 60 dollars, and there is no added costs! You get a party leader who does EVERYTHING for you, you just set the price. They have packages like 15 dollars, and 20 where you can get clothes and accessories for the bears. =)|`|htSZsds7aa	Depending how much you want to spend, and how much you want to give into her whims, anything is fine. I would opt for at home party, heck she is only 7, not 17. Kids want fun, but she is probably asking for something she has no idea about, but the "cool"kids may have done. If you give in to all her whims, plan on having the next 11 years a living hell. You are the parent 1st, not a friend 1st.
T6nvpX6zaa	Nope, we think, "God this chick is totally hot, AND she really appreciates when I take her out or get her nice things.  It is great to be with a woman who can appreciate the simple things.  And, she is willing to do more in bed than the women my age!"|`|9cTlVoVXaa	There are many different reasons why some men date younger women, and I'm sure you'll see a few.     Personally, I think it depends on where that man is in his life.   If the man is established, 30 and up, and doesn't have children, then why wouldn't he date a younger women (23-30) to start a family with. I mean statistically, women have a more difficult time having children after 34 (taking into account miscarriages, etc.).     That being said, some simply do it because they can... don't be mad, just become a cougar and do you.|`|AA10555331	for me would be great sex. when women get to the old ripe age of thirty they shut-down on the sex department.|`|elhcuN19aa	women do the same if they are not in love with their man...  I seen it happen before and was the other man on accident because I did not know...|`|P3NfIkfWaa	I would have to agree with what Jurmmin said. Because, like to connect with women the date. unless he wants only sexual relationship So, I would say dating a way younger girl than Himself it can a challenge for a guy.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Every person has their own thoughts on how they feel and what they feel with whom ever is in their arms.    When I was just a little younger in my days, 25 to precise just before I met my wife, there's a girl named Rhianna. She was just 18 yrs old. She worked at Sears in Columbus, Ga and that is where I met her.    When we dated, it was your average date, no sex, nothing more than having a great time enjoying each others company.  One day when I was clocking out, just behind my time card was a note under a paper clip and it read, meet me at Motel 6 tonight at 8:00 please come, Rhianna.    I was in shock, but I arrived and knocked and she opened the door and there she was. Long story short, when we made love my thoughts had just exploded and the sex was so intense that I could hardly breathe and we both perspired so much.  I have never in my life had such intense sex and I thought to myself would it end or would it continue to grow.    The nex time we made love it got more intense. We finally had peaked out where I had done everything with her sexually that ran through my mind when we first met.    I literally go nuts when we kissed. I guess I was oversexed or just had an extremely high sex drive.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I believe it can mean a number of things, just as if the woman were closer to his age.    Some men like to do fun and crazy things, and when you have a reserved woman who loses her fun side because she feels too old, then  he is likely going to find that fun in a younger woman.    Sometimes they fall in love with that younger woman, and I don't believe closeness of age is a requirement, more like what they have in common and mental maturity.    Assuming that a man dates a younger woman for the simple fact that she's younger is rather shallow and stereotypical.|`|kHx1upOpaa	they want to feel young and impress some one else, thats how they build there self esteem when they realize they are getting old. They can't accept the fact that there best days are behind them.|`|j7l9gavRaa	feel young, horny, impress friends|`|9VaWal2Daa	I'm thinking, .......damn!!!!!! That's HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Then I look at someone my age, and I think.......    Damn.|`|vYTRMm69aa	Age is just a number. but many men who are over 45 and date girls in their 20's are getting an ego boost. Not all these relationships workout because they just are in different mentality zones at times. The worst is when that woman reaches age 32 -36, this is when woman reach their sexual peak and they no longer are satisfied with their older partner, Oops a large percentage dump the old guy and now they are with younger men. Fact:  The most intense sexual attraction between male and females is when the guy is in his 20's and the woman is the sensuous age of 35.   EDIT:  Message to STEVE, You are clueless, the fact is men reach their sexual peak in their 20's and woman 32 - 35 are at their most sensuous sexual peak. That is why there are more younger men in relationships with the older woman now.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Actually, it depends on just how OLD the man is.  If you are talking a really old guy..in his 60's you are right on.  But a guy that is say 40's would be concerned about connecting intellectuality with a lady that age.  I would have real concerns unless it was just a booty call.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Usually they think that it means they 'still got it'....but the truth is most younger women go for older men because of their wallets!  It isn't always true...but most of the time it is.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	think the male lion of the pride.
nYK76GJpaa	maybe hes just a flirt. that doesn't mean he likes you.|`|EBS8bjAwaa	yea thats kinda weirdish...|`|uho96JIZaa	You have nothing invested in this guy, so move on. If he was into you, he would've called right away. This doesn't mean you aren't good enough, it just means you are not right for HIM. Don't lose any sleep over it. Good luck.|`|amDYXKPCaa	Hmm, Thats tricky.. Maybe call up your job, ask to speak with him, and then tell him it was you that gave the letter.|`|8zAEQaSFaa	Well if you don't talk to him but flirt with him over msn then maybe he thinks you are playing games. Maybe he isn't sure if you like him if you don't ever speak with him. Just speak to him next time you go to work. Also it is possible that he never got the letter you gave him.|`|el8XHxBpaa	call him!
6cd66b36887ecbb069f11e405495a56baa	To be honest with you, I would question what this friendship is worth.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I would at least talk to her about it calmly. Confronting her in a bad way might ruin your friendship if you really want to remain friends with her.|`|NTUr0t3haa	I might say, "I don't want to get another phone call from John telling me that you're drunk-dialing him and propositioning him. That is not the kind of friend I need in my life. It doesn't matter to me if you were drunk. I'm not into stupid drunkenness either. So if this ever occurs again, you won't see me anymore and I will be gone. And I won't care about any explanation."|`|vBkGGYJSaa	tell her how you are feeling and deal with it.  if you do not deal with it it will always be between you girls.  you never called him your boy friend, only dated him some, so she was drunk and horny and liked him some and wanted some.  stake your clame with him and tell her so.
ft8t98Pnaa	hell no I hate that show...|`|KKeLsvyGaa	Nah. I'm a bit prudish at sometimes, and having friends like that would annoy the hell out of me. It seems like their all a group of whores who just happen to all become friends. Bleh!|`|18Weffunaa	Yes, they have a great bond together. They share everything with each other.|`|rbhJhe7paa	of course, everyone wants friends like those in sitcoms- they're always perfect and know what to say and when to say it. I'm sorry, but there's nowhere in the real world that really has those kinds of people cuz noone's perfect. In reality, you have to make an effort for friendships to work.
YUtUsxLbaa	Well, here's one. . .here I am, I guess.  I don't know if I'd say that I WON'T have sex with my husband, but it has been awhile (about 4 months since the last time and I can't remember how long before that) and don't know when I will next.  Perhaps you don't see people on here admitting that they won't have sex with their spouse because they don't have any questions.  My husband hasn't posted anything about this, but doesn't wonder what I'm thinking, doesn't think I'm cheating, etc.  Perhaps we're different here because of our situation.  My perspective. . . at first, it was low sex drive - I used to have one, but unfortunately, the last thing I had the energy for is dealing with another need after dealing with the needs of others all day.  Now, it's also due to nausea.  Once our son is sleeping, the morning sickness kicks in and I never know when I'm going to vomit.  It's difficult to get in the sexy mood when you've got the almost constant and pretty urgent feeling like you're going to hurl.  If sitting still is enough to make you feel queasy, sometimes even just thinking about moving or another person touching and breathing on you can make things worse.  I do wish things were different.  I'd like to be intimate with my husband, but the desire is all gone for now, at least I hope it's just for now.  Luckily, my husband can see how miserable I am and isn't taking this personally.|`|3ywVS2JEaa	umm,,that's me,,it sounds horrible,,but after years of being treated like crap,,his chronic flirting,,cheating,,i'm grossed out with him,,i can't do the "deed" with him,,|`|T6nvpX6zaa	I think they are too embarrased by how they are and feel that they don't go on public forums and say how pathetic they are.  Which is why you hear from the frustrated and not the embarrassed.|`|ceJ3O14Yaa	I am one of the people who doesn't like to have sex with my spouse because he will not clean up, like take a shower every day, brush his teeth,  I mean uck!!! who wants to be intimate with that gross  he keeps trying and I tell him all the time take a shower and brush your teeth,   he says ok and goes and watch the tv I mean yuk!!|`|vm1Fj2AVaa	For a couple years I felt that way towards my husband. Therre was a time when it went from love making to..."hey baby, why don't you come over here and" ..... It wasn't romantic or anything and sometimes that is OK, but it seemed like that's all it was. Partly because he worked a night job and he'd come home and I'd be working in my home office and he'd just want to get a deed done and then go to sleep. So that started the slow process of us growing apart and me eventually hating sex and just doing it here and there when I felt I had too. Just alot of bad cercumstances that weren't really either of ours direct fault, but it happened and then he had an affair. After a lot of hurt and painful months, our relationship feels new again, he takes time for me and we kiss alot before sex and it just feels right. It's crazy to think that for a time, I was grossed out. I didn't want to kiss him, or anything after awhile, it was all a turnoff for me, and now ALL of the things that were turning me off are things I desire all day long.  So there are lots of things that can make this happen. I was never cheating and actually thought I hated sex in general and now again it is a wonderful thing.|`|fTiXy11caa	well I am one of those people with low sex drive.  it reallly is true.  I just don't feel like having sex.  I'm 40 years old so maybe age or hormones has something to do with it, who knows?  I'll tell you what I think about:  My husband is angry and accuses me of deliberately keeping sex from him, no matter what I say, and it just makes me angry because he feels he is entitled to sex anyway.  I give it to him to keep the peace, but I just feel resentful about it and it makes me dislike sex even more.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Great question.  In every area of marriage save one it is understood that marriage is about compromise.  In that "one" area a high percentage of women believe there is no need for compromise.  Those women truly believe that if he wants to make love daily, and she wants to 2 times a month, than 2 times a month it is.  Those same women, if their husbands took the same approach regarding money, family size, etc. in terms of a completely rigid negotiating posture, they would find it unacceptable.  Any self respecting man who treats his wife well, and tolerates this behavior is not a self respecting man.  Act like a doormat and you get treated like a doormat.    To be fair, if your wife says, in order to want you I need "..." and what she needs is reasonable - like basic higene - and you don't deliver, then you deserve the cold shoulder.  But in many/most of these situations that does not seem the case to an outsider like me.|`|j7l9gavRaa	interesting    they are probably out cheating or jacking off|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	hmmm im not at all disgusted with my hubby i love hi mto death and think he is a hottie. I knwo we have had our times where he complained he wasnt getting enough sex but i honestly never thought about it cause i was satisfied. I think your sex life fluxuates with the marriage, during hard times it is less often and during better times it is more often, that is how it was for us at least.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	lol...lol...

He seems to be trying to loose weight though. :-)
EPIELNBuaa	i think its pretty funny that out of every single person in this world, you find the daughter of your dads ex-lover. small world. but honestly, for them, its probably old news, its mostly just shocking to you right now since you didnt know. if you're really interested in this girl, dont let what happened over 20 years stop you, who knows what you might miss. your moms had 20+ years to get over it, im pretty sure shes healed by now.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Your dad sounds like a great guy.  This is worthy of a movie.|`|SsfnitjXaa	What are you having trouble with, loosing the girlfriend and telling her?  That would be a strange thing, because I don't know if you should tell this girl that her mother and your dad "did it".  Best to just make an excuse why you are stopping the relationship and move on.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Just think, you could be banging your half sister.|`|AA10248966	you wrote:    i cant let the relationship get serious for my mother's sake, which i understand.      Oh really? Yes you CAN see her and even get serious about her. You are  entitled to have the partner you want, despite others protestations. Get real and realize that you must live YOUR life YOUR way, and doing this for another is not in your interest. In fact, it will be teaching your mother she can have reign over you forever. YOU DO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU, period, end of discussion|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	This just goes to show how deeply an affair can hurt! Twenty + years later and it still hurts people....    My question to you is: How are you gonna tell your gf that you cannot see her because of what your parents did all those years ago? Her mother apparently has not come clean with her as your dad did....    If you do nothing else, learn from his mistake. He sounds really great, that he was, and is, remorseful and has done what it takes to correct things.|`|j7l9gavRaa	why can't your relationship get serious?  you and your gf have to be punished because your dad messed up?  your dad sounds great but i dont agree with that its your life|`|4GmeIopoaa	I dont have a long intellegent answer like everybody else has on here but I can say that if you arent completely head over heels in love with this girl, It's not worth hurting your familys feelings.

You sound like a real great girl, one who would make a great girl friend to anyone. Stop seeing this "secret boyfriend" and start taking care of yourself.  Your desire to please someone else is not good for your long time self image.  Start today to stand up for yourself.  What does it really matter if the football team wins or looses?

They look weird    i am also enough emotional drama to handle and i dont want more on my plate with another nagging girl, guys can ignore you and make you shut up, but not in a physical or verbally abusive way. All they have to say is dont worry about it, kiss me, ignore me, give me space, come see me or talk with me and ill shut up and move on with my life. When talking to a girl the same stuff will always come up and never get solved because you both wont give it up.    Their smell, eyes, smile, retarded humor, the sex (warm and not a cold di*do), able to help you create a beautiful child, there clothes, being athletic and making me feel that i look my best all the time even when i dont wear make up or i am sick    women are pretty but men are the opposites and i am attracted to that|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	Idk I just do.

aDIPIu7xaa	Its a choice.    And anyone who says different has no clue what love is.    Love is always patient;13     love is always kind;          love is never envious    or arrogant with pride.          Nor is she conceited,    5            and she is never rude;           she never thinks just of herself    or ever get annoyed.          She never is resentful;    6            is never glad with sin,           but always glad to side with truth,    whene'er the truth should win.[b]    7      She bears up under everything,     believes the best in all,          there is no limit to her hope,    and she will never fall.|`|OG4410bdaa	A- a feeling    but I'd like to add that if you do not make the choice to nurture that feeling, then it can fade  it starts with a feeling, but can only continue to grow as a feeling so long as you make the choice to help it grow    for example:  you feel love for one another  but you don't spend time together to connect  then the feeling starts to fade  make the choice to reconnect on a daily basis  then the feeling of love will grow|`|j7l9gavRaa	starts with a FEELING that you must CHOOSE to work on and honor|`|y9CgveCGaa	Love is a choice.

Feeling|`|dtHjJah5aa	Love is a feeling that you chose whether or not to act on.  Let me explain.  I love my husband but I chose to continue working on our marriage even when he fails to uphold his part.  I can chose to stop working on our marriage and although it will take time I can chose to stop loving him.  So both answers are correct.|`|elhcuN19aa	It is B then A|`|YUtUsxLbaa	Both?  The definition is A, but I've been told that it's B - and for a long-lasting marriage, I've seen it helps to be B.|`|ceJ3O14Yaa	the answer is A    a feeling|`|AA11895524	A choice|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Its both A and B.Yes of course love is a feeling(the most wonderful feeling in the world).But its his/her choice to take that chance in their life and see exactly where it takes them.|`|AA11984795	It starts as a feeling and then becomes a choice.|`|3ywVS2JEaa	it's both you have to make the choice to being open to those type of feelings for someone,,|`|dSMb8JDvaa	it is both actually..but to answer for me it is a choice.B|`|fTiXy11caa	Neither!  Love is a verb.    I Love her.  (complete sentence:  subject + verb)    Love is a verb.  Love is what you do for someone because you care about them very much and like them for who they are, and loving feelings follow these loving actions.  That is why there is the natural phenomenon of nurses "falling in love" with their patients.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	feeling|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Mostly A.  But when not "A" then you make a choice "B" do to certain things to make it "A" again.  If my wife and I didn't make "B" choices that lead to "A" than the "A" would eventually fade away.      That is why marriage is work.  If you think a lifetime of love is automatic you have read one to many romance novels.

My first husband passed away while we were together. However, we probably would've eventually gotten divorced because we were both very unhappy. It would've probably been easier for me to marry a second time with being divorced than to be widowed because it seems like it'd be more emotionally trying to have lost a spouse rather than leaving a spouse. I've never been divorced though, so I wouldn't know.    I would never assume that because of one failed relationship, that all of my relationships would fail.

I am equally happy being married but if a divorce happened, I imagine I would be an emotional wreck (as I wouldn't want a divorce) and I would not "chance" marriage again.      If the case of being a widow, I guess it would depend how old I was.

I was there...I swore to God id never marry again, I made my brother and many friends promise me that if i ever came to them and said I was getting married again to please stop me and that I was very serious. They all said OK. LOl I even went so far as to not pursue a divorce for years after I left the marraige only to protect myself from me. If I wasnt divorced how could I possibly get married to anyone else.    That I confess was a girl completely unhealthy in thought and actions. My first husband was an alcoholic, abuseive, a cheat, a druggy, and just down right deranged. My father and all men that I had been exposed to in life were abusive in many forms and controlling etc etc etc. So I based all I knew of men on the fact that they were all scum.    Well ladies im here to tell you that it is not so. It seemed that way because I had never been exposed to a healthy person who also incidently was of the male gender.     I did marry again, and yes my brother and friends kept thier promises and to remind me of how they were supposed to dissuade me from it.    Those....!@ $%^&!!!!  LOL Just kidding!    Not all men are like my first spouse and probably as truthful to say about the second but they are all as diverse as we women are.    If this one dies will I remarry. I say No but for entirely different reasons than the first.    In life I have never been alone. My whole life has been dedicated to being either someones mother or someones wife. Ive never really had a time where i had my own room first I shared with my siblings then marraiges and on and on. I have decided in the event that i even become single again by whatever means I need to allow myself that time to experience life without being in a relationship. Go Me!!!|`|mqi6h7gdaa	I would have to say NO, im looking at a divorce here in near future and i dont think i could ever love anyone again. My wife has been cheating on me and its not all her fault. I didnt do all things that  husband should do with the kids and housework, i was more concerned about my life.  It hurts when u push someone away and grab them back and i would be scarred to do that again. Plus, you get sex more when ur not married and u dont have to put up with monthly attitudes.
M3CsxF2jaa	God is LOVE|`|gIszhbQNaa	Love is a very strong feeling of affection. Love is partly created by hormones in the brain, telling the person if they love somebody. Love is not easily described, because it is a mix of emotions; people can love and be loved in different ways.    Love is the attraction of one person to another person, object or sensation. It is debated whether animals can experience love. Love is created by chemical reactions in the brain. Eating chocolate releases the same chemicals in the brain, giving one the feeling of love.    Different people can feel or experience love in different ways, so it is hard to define love.    A common belief is that there is a difference between being "in" love and loving someone. Being in-love is something which many people believe is too much; people think about the person or thing they are in love with a lot, the person might think that the one he/she is "in love" with is very important to them.    There are many forms of love: self-love, divine love, love for another person (family member, friend, lover), just to name a few. In fact, love does not even have to involve people; for example, love can exist in regard to an object or idea. Psychology divides love into three basic categories: brotherly love, romantic love, and physical love. Theoretically, having all three makes true love.    Often love can be confused with another feeling, such as sexual attraction, affection, obsession or feelings of friendship. There are examples when love can be destroyed; love was once there, but another feeling, such as jealousy or anger, has taken over the feeling of love.    Love is based on respect, admiration, and communication. Respect must be present in order for love to grow. One cannot love someone or something one disrespects or hates, or is unable to communicate with.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	as you get to know more in life you will understand this .. better ... but my x wife will tell u she love me ..then went to a new guy .. thats life .mate ..|`|OHfZFR31aa	Because people change and grow apart over time. With one long-term boyfriend, when we met I was attracted to him because he did like to travel, go out all the time, meet new people, go to new restaurants, etc. He was very active. But after about 2 years of being together, it was impossible to even get him out to a restaurant once a month. He just wanted to stay home and watch TV. Had he been like that at the beginning, I wouldn't have gone out with him in the first place.  The person I had fallen in love with at the beginning was not the same person who I was with 2 years later.|`|9CCXPGXqaa	it's complicated.  Divorcing someone doesn't mean you stop loving your partner.  It just means you can't seem to live with the problems and you decide they aren't fixable.|`|2pOl8PU6aa	Our modern view of "love" could very well be the source of all evil.    Think about it.    When you "love" somebody, you immediately exclude everyone else from that intimate circle between you and your partner.     Love is the reason why the Muslims hate Christians. Love is the reason why soldiers "fight for their country."    When you love somebody, you love them because they obviously have qualities that YOU love for YOUR own accommodation and pleasure.     To truly love somebody, you need to look at it and see all the flaws and say, "I still love this." And you also need to love everybody else on an equal level, even strangers.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	That is ahard question and is not for everyone.

I wanted a divorce....never wanted to see him again! THen I found out his name was not Chadwick, but Chad plain and simlple.....there are different outcomes for diff people....it does happen they just fall out of love. They find out one cheated, a temper gets out of control, a bad habit forms-drinking-drugs....it all depends!|`|WChr31Otaa	Love is like a hit song.. it's hard to keep it at the top of the charts... Love fades sometimes and that's the way it is.  I can't tell you what love is because it's only what you make it. It's love when your happy  with just making them happy.|`|KcUX0WCeaa	I think when people say these things for each other they're mixing up the strong emotions they feel for actual love or they might be saying it because they think they should.  Love comes in many different forms and is harder to find the real deal and know you have the real deal.    There is something called the Triangular Theory of Love that will tell you the three parts of love and what is needed, and what combinations of these three parts make which kind of love.    When it's not the real deal, time will tell the two people who so easily threw those words around in the past and ends in divorce or break up. :(  on the other hand, its nice to know that you can go out there and find real true love.|`|gMYoi210aa	well i havnt been married yet, BUT i do know that the love they feel at first fades away, slowly as they get to know eachother's bad habits and stuff like that, so when that happens they start to get tired of eachother, and eventually one cheats on the other and they...divorce! thats why its EXTREMELY importand that u pick the right person!!!  good answer right? i deserve 10 points?|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	I am currently impending a divorce from my estranged husband of 8 years.  Him and I rushed into our marriage and when I met him, he really had me believing he would change my world and make all of the worries go away.  We never got to really, really know the other and fell in love with the idea of being married without focusing on our marriage.  We entered the marriage each with our set of expectations that were in opposition with the others- we were opposites with one common interest :a want of being married (for security).    We started our marriage okay and got used to each other but eventually I discovered a narcissistic side to him that often resorted to verbal abuse when things didn't go as he planned.  After years of verbal abuse, insults, degrading comments- I closed my heart to him.  It was hurt and hurt badly.  I loved him but I also wanted to love myself again.  For this reason, I sought a divorce although I will always love and care for him but cannot be married to him.  We just don't belong together.                         What is love?   My heart says this about love:    It has the hands to help others.  It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy.  It has the eyes to see misery and want.  It has the ears to hear sighs and sorrows of people.|`|sBhV6fyxaa	people grow apart.  then once you live together you find out things about a person you don:t like .why you stay with a person to make them happy and you not you cannot make a person love you .let me know .i would rather be alone than with someone that don:t care.                been there live long you will to.|`|3JMEzpC5aa	People who love each other can change.

Now though I see it was better he was chnaged and not right for me anymore.  But i will always love him.|`|yYQuZgVkaa	Sometimes people just grow apart.  I think that LOVE is an unexplainable feeling.  It's different for everyone.  You can still love a person and not like them.  Sometimes people divorce because they thought that they loved that person or they still love them there just not in love with them.  A lot of times people get being in love and just loving someone mix up.|`|Lnwi0ULuaa	theres different ways to love. you can't really put love in one catagory. you can love conditionally/ unconditionally you can love/ be in love. theres differences. i guess the main point is to be happy. to really love someone there happiness and emotional state is more important than your own. you don't ask what she can give me but what i can give him/her to make him/her happy. and in a relationship, if someone isn't happy it's cause the other person is thinking about themselves more than there spouse. after a while the word love changes a little. becomes more like any other word. thats if the relationship is going bad.|`|nr1Bt47baa	My Dad always told me that you hate the person you love the most. So far he has been right.|`|0F8hauikaa	I've learned (the hard way) that love isn't always enough. There are many other factors that shape relationships, such as money, family, friends, careers and personal interests. It's a sad, but real truth. Also, people can mature differently. In my case, I continued growing as a person but my ex-husband remained irresponsible and immature, causing many conflicts. It doesn't mean we stopped loving each other, it just meant we could no longer live together in harmony.
RA3Lky6Qaa	Most definitely personality. I fell in love with my friend because his personality is amazing and him being cute is a plus. but that shouldn't matter. if you fall in love with someone for their looks then in 15plus years when the beauty fades another beauty will come along. or the beauty can have the worst personality. but if the personality is amazing and that is who you want to be with then you'll always be happy.|`|vgGnRiozaa	For me I will choose personality....I think good looking comes from good personality :)|`|AaoLwJJWaa	Looks attract me to the person in the first place, and their personailty makes me stay with them.

It may be a type of chaste nonmonogamy, one without consummation. When the affair breaches a monogamous agreement with one or another spouse the term infidelity may be more apt. Infidelity tends to exclude one or both spouses of the affair's partners. Citing the absence of any sexual activity can neutralize the sense of extramarital wrongdoing by one or both partners of an emotional affair.    Emotional affairs can be portrayed in fictional writing or drama as life changing experiences (good or bad), subjects of racy romance stories that teeter on the edge. However, they can also be catastrophic for all concerned when it is clandestine, unsanctioned and unintentionally exposed.    Sometimes an emotional affair injures a committed relationship more than if it were a one night stand or about casual sex. The initial interpersonal attraction may have been the result of propinquity (physical or psychological proximity), physical attraction or a perceived lack of interpersonal chemistry in the primary relationship.|`|j7l9gavRaa	telling a friend of the opposite sex things that you should only tell your significant other  cnofiding in them secrets that your significant other doesn't even know   stuff like that|`|sVdQSMvJaa	An emotional affair is when a married man or woman pursues a "friendship" with someone of the oppostise sex and out of that friendship there comes a mutual attraction and expression of feelings of love or interest.  In an emotional affair it is understood and expressed that both parties are attracted to one another but no sexual involvement has taken place YET.    I am a married woman and one of my best friends is male.  We have been friends since I was 19.  However it is a strictly platonic friendship and to keep it so I do not spend time with him alone, not because I fear that I might develop feelings for him but because I want to make no room for even the hint of impropriety.|`|9VaWal2Daa	fact of life is........married people grow apart and can fall OUT of love, just as easily as they fell IN love.   Ya never see anyone mentioning that part of it.     Yeah, maybe your partner was great for 5, 10 15 years...........but maybe at some point, they're not.   People change.     An emotional affair, is when your body is one place, but your mind and heart is in another place.     I have a married friend......and we are so right for each other, it's freaking ridiculous.   But she is married, with a kid......and we keep it on a friendship level.........but we both know the truth.     Life is what happens to you when you are busy making all these other plans.|`|OG4410bdaa	friendship:  you are to them the same as you are to your other friends, regardless of gender  you enjoy their company, but you do not crave their company while apart  you keep no secrets about the friendship from your spouse    emotional affair:  you look forward to seeing them more than seeing your spouse  you think about them constantly while apart  you wish your spouse had qualities more like them  you tell them secrets that you do not tell your spouse  you turn to them instead of to your spouse when you are upset    basically a friendship is a nice addition to your life  but an emotional affair means you seek emotional support from them rather than from your spouse  its a sign that your marriage is very weak and lacking  and it puts you at risk for a phyiscal affair    although, I personally would be much more hurt if my husband had an emotional affair than I would if he had just had sex with another woman...sex would just mean he had a moment of primal weakness, an emotional affair would be that I was not taking care of his emotional needs and that he felt our marriage was lacking something he had to seek elsewhere|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Emotional affair is falling in love with someone else or having feelings for someone else that is not your husband/wife.|`|GWorLZ4gaa	I think an emotional affair is worse than a physical one.

An emotional affair is a friendship with someone of the opposite sex that you share your deepest thoughts and highest highs, lowest lows with - and you don't share these things with your S.O. It is also something that your spouse or S.O  would not approve of if they knew about it - if your friend and your spouse know eachother and there are no secrets, it's fine, but the minute you share something with this friend that you wouldn't share with your spouse, it's an emotional affair.

LzkSscDSaa	Wow first of all your girlfriend should do something about it, because if she laughs when getting hit on......that shows a sign of her feeding into attention which is one characteristic 90% of girls have, THEY LOVE ATTENTION! from anyone!  Thats not good because it can mean it can turn into something else, not cheating wise, but can cause her to become flirty! trust me im a woman myself, i dont feed off attention but 99.9 percent of my friends do! There isnt really a way you cant be angry about it because, shes your girlfriend, you love her, and you dont want any other horny men looking at her, because it shows a sign of disrespect not only for your girlfriend, but for you as well.....keep that in mind! you should talk to her :)    hope that helped|`|FplTPoAyaa	She chose YOU. Stop being insecure...it is a turn off for a woman.  Yes, she is beautiful, and you should feel proud that other men look at her with admiration.  If you continue to feel angry about it, flip out over it, or show her how insecure you are being, you WILL lose her.  So, be an adult and cherish what you have.  Jealousy will get you nowhere but alone.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	sorry, dude, nothing you can do,, you are man.. this will never end|`|nYK76GJpaa	some Girls like to know that its bothering you and they get a kick out of it.

Insecurity and jealousy can ruin even the best relationships.  Trust her until she gives you reason not to.      Hope this helps.|`|0le6RYndaa	I must be the only one who thinks you have a right to be mad.  She laughs it off...to me that means she enjoys the attention.  How does she react to the guys?  She needs to respect you and understand that you don't enjoy a bunch of guys hitting on her.  If she is enjoying the attention then you shouldn't be with her.  Girls need to have limits.  Too many people think now that "hot" chicks can get away with anything because of their looks.  I see other people saying that you should be happy she is with you...that's not true.  You need someone for how they are inside, not outward appearance.      Also, just because she is with you doesn't mean she's faithful.  If she enjoys the attention, she could very well end up cheating if she hasn't already.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	The problem is on you end.

If she's a ho! (and you know it in your heart) - dump her, even though she is hot.  I know that sounds crazy, but no need to stay with a B! if she's actually a straight up ho!     If she isn't, then you have serious trust issues.  Mommy dropped you when you were a little kid ??? Get over it.  You have a hot GF now, and you need to MAN UP.    Hot chicks don't like insecure wussies, so act like the Playa! that you want to be.  Even if you are scared, do not express that to her (or anyone else - as it will get back to her).  Act like you couldn't care less.  She is "your" (hot) girlfriend.  Exuding confidence will be even more attractive to her (and her friends that control her).    Remember - most hot girls have really low self esteem.  Use that to your advantage.  Be "the man".    But, if she is a ho! dump her before anything bad happens.|`|amDYXKPCaa	You're not being COMPLETELY jealous. It's okay to be a little jealous though. It's healthy. It shows that you care that much about her, that you don't want to lose her.  Just remember who she is going home with in the end.  That would be you. Obviously you're not to shabby if she picked you, and wants to be with you. You got her man, but give her a little space as well. I'm sure she'll love you no matter what. Don't worry about it.|`|dubmpF7Raa	Don't be mad.  People flirt all the time. It's not a big deal. It's a natural thing.  If she likes you as much as you like her, then you should be able to trust her.|`|el8XHxBpaa	Well if she loves/likes you she will be faithful.  why be mad?  That just means you have a beautiful girl and shes all yours.  don't be jealous be proud that shes yours and shes faithful|`|x3AGjiF2aa	There is no reason at all for you to be angry! Jealousy is a really bad thing... and it makes most girls want to run the other way. You should be happy that your gf is hot and other guys think so to! As long as she doesn't flirt back there is nothing wrong. Have a little faith in your relationship, because if you don't it wont get very far!|`|iCuwFLURaa	Dude, you two have something special. She is hot and you are left holding the (accept it bag), should the relationship last many years from now, she may not be so hot and you might be that sexy senior citizen. Get the point?

You guys be good kids she'll be over it  !!|`|VF19ylFTaa	Well yeah it's really hard for us kids to see mum going through tensions & all. The obvious & best thing you can do is to talk to her about the matter. Tell her that from the last few days you're feeling something is troubling her. Communicate how the whole thing is affecting you.. as you're unable to figure out what's going wrong. Office politics isn't the only stressor.. sometimes sudden increase in workload at office adds to the stress. If you guys haven't gone for a vacation from a long time, then this is the most appropriate time to treat her with a stress-relieving mini-vacation. I know you gonna have your exams soon.. so let your mum & dad go alone.  Mood swings & hormonal changes are another set of anxiety-generators.  You can take her for a long walk & talk over the issue. You both (or whole family) can go hoteling this weekend. Involve your other sibs too. Share your feelings with them. Tell them to do their level best to make mum feel comfortable. Crack some jokes that'll make her laugh. Good laugh is a great stress reliever as it releases endorphins & other healthy hormones, leaving her with a positive frame of mind. So incorporate more humour in her life.  Suggest her to start gardening for some time. Planting a graden can be a great way to reconnect with nature which will giver her peace of mind.  Take her out in the sunlight. It's winter so it's a lot easier to move in the sunlight. Getting out in the sunlight can actually improver her mood as it provides an influx of Vitamin D & the fresh air that goes with it is good for her health.  Give your mum her favourite book that she always wanted to read. Ask her to join meditation classes or do exercise & stretching regularly as exercise is a great mood lifter. Make sure her diet is proper & she takes her daily vitamins with a proper 8 hours sleep. Get a hot cup of coffee/tea with her in the evening & have a light chat. Remind her to take 3-4 deep breaths while she's in the office.    The idea is to first know the cause of the tension & then helping her deal with it. All she needs is relaxation I guess.      Good Luck!|`|6faae8648aa9b26ce3773e3c757af4a3aa	Could be the economy or people just get stressed.

You should ask your mother as to why she has depressed and stresses.  Persuade her to open up and vent out her problems if any.

I think she wont because anyone who doesnt really want help wont tell people what's going on in their lives. She didnt just bring it up because she just wanted to chat she was reaching out but didnt want to ask for help. I think you should bring it in one day, sit her down in her office and tell her that you thought that she could use this and you cant. So it doesnt seem like charity you can say that you tried to give it to members of your family but they dont like ham and you knew that she had a son and granddaughter at home and knew she could use it. Good luck!|`|cNnTgm7maa	It depends on your relationship with here. If you two are close enough were she confided these things to you in private the I would say you were concerned for the welfare of a friend and you were not over stepping anything. Though if she is the type that tells everyone her drama, then I would say no. She may take it the wrong way and it could effect your professional relationship. Which in the end could result in drama for you.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	ask her to do you a favor and take the ham you don't like it anyhow and you would hate to throw it away and waste food.
MPtt9wPjaa	first of all you seem to be a nice and humble person, the world could use more people like that.  if you're getting vibes like that from this guy, then be careful. i'm usually the first to say that people should trust more in this world, but when situations like this arise it's foolish to let yourself be trampled over too. Remain the nice girl you seem to be, but don't be blinded in any way to what you're facing. Two wrongs never make a right, so it's not nice to do anything back. Whatever reason it may be, you honestly cant know until you're him. And since that's impossible, dont dwell on it. Keep up your good work, if you mess up, you're only human. If he's getting a kick out of it, then that's his bad trait and your maturity. He wants a reaction out of you and you should not give him one. He'll eventually get sick of his childishness and leave you alone. And if he doesn't then it would be wise for you to talk to him.  Good luck! :)  take care
EuwGku8vaa	Don't believe "xkrazi" she is crazy hence her name.. Not all guys are stupid and take advantage of girls, they are few and far between but gentleman still exist.. You just need to find someone who loves you completely and who would never purposely betray your trust..

Better to wait than risk rejection.|`|lONYZIHGaa	I need more information. Did he tell you that he "fancies" you as well? If he has interest in you too then I would definetly ask him out. However, if you're still unsure of how he feels, wait on it.|`|wH2Ztocuaa	ask him why he asked if he says just wonderd then ask him|`|1isE17ojaa	Now|`|gK0W7cUFaa	i would wait..  just to see how it'll take yal  he may end up rejecting you   soo you never kno|`|cmFU81rQaa	yes.  now.|`|N7Xt3zDHaa	You should do what your heart tells you to do.If you think your readdy|`|ffd55edbc3eb321363da4138a90098abaa	Now!

Don't make it sound like it's a date but in reality it really is. it takes the pressure off.|`|nNwhRY3Faa	umm i would wait....i think that it would be better to wait for him to say something to you....ive been in this situation before....ITS ALWAYS BETTER TO WAIT!!!!|`|a12JRGm5aa	Here's the thing, if there was a girl I liked and she told me she felt the same way then I don't know what I'd do, probably nothing.  If you actually want to be with him, ask.  NOW!  cause if you don't he might think you were just toying with him, that hurts.  If he hasn't started avoiding you, and he hasn't told you he feels otherwise, then that's probably a good sign.  Go for it.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Yes, ask him today.|`|zLGOQQs5aa	ask now!|`|g2QUNwZzaa	no time like the present...  he already knows u like him...|`|Vqe6cvRGaa	Sure, just go right up to him and say, "I've liked you for two years, and I  have been following you around and I know who you have gone out with, but now it's time, you go out with me!!!!"  Good Luck sista'|`|dDSuBQURaa	Rope him in and make his your valentine. Don't wait any longer when you have already waited for two years.|`|AA11309717	ask him out. He obviously knows now that you like him. If he didn't run away from you screaming when you told him you like him then he's probably waiting for you to ask him out, especially if he's too shy to admit he likes you.      Good Luck!
Y4FuSV2Yaa	Its basic nature, every species has one major goal in life, to reproduce. I have kids (I had 2 and got my tubes tied) Personally I think it is very selfish to have kids, the world is horrible and overpopulated so why put this innocent person that didnt ask to be born through such a terrible life. Humans are a disease, they have nearly destroyed this planet and aare now trying to figure out a way to colonize Mars, to spread the disease. Awesome!    Like I said I have kids, and I love my kids they are sweet, funny, and beautiful. But if you THINK you dont want kids, you dont want kids. Its just personal preference. I have a friend(girl) who has never wanted kids and when she turned 18 (years ago) she wanted to have he tubes tied and the doc wouldnt do it because she was too young to make that decision. This is ridiculous!! She could go into the Army and kill people but cant have an elective medical procedure? B/S And guess what, she STILL doesnt have kids!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	just ignore them.  if you don't want kids then don't have kids.  just make sure you are married to someone who either doesn't want them as well or is willing to give up the prospect of children to be with you.    this can be a real deal breaker for some people and many a marriage has ended because the couple refused to deal with this issue before they married.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	if you dont want and like kids then you dont like and want kids!|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	i was almost the same way...i never really liked kids...  maybe for a moment but then it would get annoying....now i have my own..he is 2 1/2months.and trust me i,t is wonderful specially when you know that that tiny little person is yours and that he is depending on you, they begging to love you and follow you and smile at you and you just wont be able to turn that love away...........hes the most important person in my life and i would give my life 1,000 times for him.....i dont want anymore kids though, at least for now because it takes alot of time and attention.
yW9ZmY13aa	Yea thats a good idea, show everyone you can think of your girlfriends vibrator, she will thank you and love you forever, lol|`|Nnk45e3Faa	you should take her vibrator and stick up your own ***.its no buisness of yours.she should beat you like a redheaded step child.  idiot !|`|u4NXQkq7aa	well first of all you broke her trust by going thru her stuff.. great boyfriend  ok second you should be thankful that she has a vibrator and not another boyfriend why dont u ask if she will use it on herself for you or can you use it for her to enhance your sex between one another but y on earth would you want to have her arrested and i am almost sure you cannot have charges put on her but i would be careful she might be able to on you if not she may be looking for a new man that understands that having those things is perfeclly normal and is willing to use them with her on her i dont think you totally understand how lucky you are to have her|`|xXXXJECEaa	haha no, it's not a crime to be sexually deviant.  good try.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	well they might just laugh at you..maybe just take it up to her boss i guess idk|`|Q27cXlGbaa	uhm. what is illegal about that ?|`|VtTU4KcNaa	If you live in a state with backward, outdated laws, then I would say yes you can.  Personally though, I think it would be more fun to join her in her sexual deviance.|`|ark4Psqjaa	dude you want to turn your girlfriend in to police because you found a vibrator and other adult stuff first of all you should not go true her stuff while she is at work if you tell her about that she will be mad|`|JCdBSULraa	While she will have to answer to God, the police do not enforce God's law, they enforce man's law, which she has not broken.
JlDcVTVsaa	every time he does some thing that makes you happy tell him right away.  even if its some thing really small like taking out the bin.  tell him how much you appreciate little things he does to you.    also dont wait for him to ask for sex, show him that you also want it, even if he is not asking for it, have sex with him. wear some thing sexy, and tell him that seeing him makes you horny.     good luck :)|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Sounds like you are really doing a lot of great things for him and your marriage.  And over time those things will make a big difference.  As a man it is great that you are giving him sex whenever "he" wants it.  But as the man in a 20 year marriage I can tell you that "NOTHING" compares to the glow that comes from having my wife make the time and effort to seduce me.  This requires at least two hours of undivided attention.  It is a mix of lingerie and a long slow massage and a lot of foreplay - and yes my wife knows exactly what I like in that department.  And afterwards we lie in bed for a while and maybe after that watch a show/movie we both like.    As for the comments about how bad he should feel about the affair.  Only you and he know that.  If you really were a shrew then focus on being good to him and he won't cheat again.  If a wife pushes a husband to the breaking point, and he breaks and then she beats on him about that, he becomes an "ex-husband" permanently.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Offer to take him out for dinner...Even watch movies with him    Most of all respect him like he does you.|`|OG4410bdaa	pack him his lunch for work  and every once inawhile slip in a simple "I love you" note    bake him his favorite cookies from scratch, just as a suprise, no other reason    make him special dinners    take showers with him, give him a massage in the shower  but nothing else unless he wants more    rub his back to help him fall asleep at night    give him control of the tv remote  and show an interest in his favorite shows and sports even if you don't really like them    kiss him everyday when he wakes up  when he leaves for work  when he comes home from work  when you go to bed    look him in the eye and tell him you love him everytime you kiss him    when he gets home from work  let him vent about his day first and for as long as he needs to, no matter how bad your day was    if you get up to get a drink  offer him one too    and if he's in the kitchen, ask him to bring you a snack  he'll appreciate the chance to be told "thank you"    *edit*  I agree with the above poster who said words hurt more than fists  truth is, he has been programed to be afraid of you  programed to think that you dislike him and that he can't do anything good enough for you  it took years to strip him down and do that to him  it may take years to bulid him back up  however you're trying- you're trying to change and that is the first step in the right direction  just be patient and consistant  your marriage has endured alot, so try be gentle with him for now|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Read these books:  To Things Your Guy Wished you Knew but is too Scared to Tell You  Surrendered Wife  The Love and Respect Relationship    I am not saying you have to follow them to a T, but I read them and it gave me some really good insight to the male mind. I realized guys need affection a lot differently then women. It was hard at first and felt silly BUT the effectiveness is amazing. Our marriage is great now. He feels good and makes me feel good in return.    Somethings I did w/ my husband:  compliment him - chores, etc. Try to always notice when he does something and try not to criticize, like the can go here not there...  brag about him to friends/family so he can hear (don't talk bad about him)  Slip little notes in his lunch or coat pocket or something  initiate sex  offer massages  cook his favorite meals  let him unwind when he comes home from work before really conversing, and great him with a smile  If you have children, make sure they ask his permission sometimes and stick to what he says  When he offers to help you, let him, and thank him    Good luck!    Oh, I don't recommend anything by Dr. Laura, she's mean|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Let me get this right. You drove him away, He found someone that appreciated him, now you want him back. The wounds of mean word go much deeper than a physical wound. Its going to take time before he really trusts you. Spend time doing things you both enjoy. Dont pretend it will stick out like a sore thumb.|`|j7l9gavRaa	make him his fave meals, buy him little gifts here and there, listen to him, talk to him like a person|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	Just say thank you when he does things or gets things for you that he doesn't have to. Compliment how he looks when you like what you see. Just think of things that would make you feel good about yourself and do those for him.   I don't mean to sound mean, but he did have an affair and I am glad that he feels so bad about it. Although be careful with your words, guilt and remorse are two different things and what he should be feeling is remorse, not guilt. Also keep in mind that while you were the person who was unappreciative, he was the person who cheated so you both have a lot of making up to do.   Best of luck and it sounds like you guys are on the right track!|`|mAPSl0DZaa	He endured years of critisism  and excepting the opposite may take years as well. Words hurt more than fists and the wounds take much longer to heal. Theres a good chance its not the guilt of the affair and hurting you that is the doubting factor for him. If you tell someone something long enough they begin to believe that of themselves. he needs time to heal and lets hope he can and that he can start beieving and trusting in what you say now. Be patient and consistant. Forgive him and yourself.|`|04Te5gzzaa	Don't cave in and just be his slave for the rest of your life.  You are both at fault for the affair...you drove him to it and he went looking for it.  So instead of trying everything to "keep" him happy, try working on making your marriage better by sharing/talking more, doing things together.  With regards to the sex, why not when you want it?  It definitely makes him feel good when you WANT to have sex with him...not only succumbing whenever he wants to have sex.  Stop letting yourself be treated as a sex toy and be his lover instead!|`|YDBpaNPzaa	Showing him that you appreciate him is the best route, telling him is not going to work the same as it did when you were criticizing him, giving him cards, and writing poem's is nice but those things work much better if there is no under lying emotional/verbal abuse. And, only you know your husband, or maybe not! But, you need to tap into the things that he appreciates in life, or brings him peace. If it's fishing that he en joy's then make plan a fishing trip for him to go on and sup rise him. In what situation have you seen him in throughout your marriage that you know for a fact w/o it being said that he was at peace and happy. Then make it happen for him, he will see the efforts that you've gone through for him to enjoy that, those actions count. He wants you to know him, okay if you were abusive for years, then he is finding it hard to believe that you know him, or you would not have said or done those things. So, Your going to have to focus on him and know what type's of things in life move him. When he see's these positive actions of kindness and consideration he will slowly start to see that you Truly love him.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	Unfortunately, you can't "make" anyone feel good - you can help, but can't make it happen.  It's ultimately his choice.  In order to help, keep working on your marriage, do what you're doing, keep thinking of other ways, but most important, be patient.  It will take awhile to help combat the years you criticized him.  Good luck.
RvnBmy8laa	LOOK FIRST THING IS FIRST CHECK HOW OLD THE POSTING OF HIM SAYING THAT IS THEN IF ITS OLD DNT WORRY ABOUT IT IF ITS RECENT FORGET HIM PLUS UR YOUNG PEOPLE TEND 2 HAVE LOTS OF CRUSHES AT A YOUNG AGE BUT THE MOST IMPORANT THING IS WAT DO U WANT FROM THIS GUY THEN MAKE UR OWN CHOICE AND I PUSH OWN|`|Y2sDswLBaa	He really really likes you. Simple as that.|`|3PFJGzzsaa	i think that sumbody is about to get a BF! and its you!
AA11294818	There's a possibility she didn't think it was a date.  BUT don't be hard on yourself. I have had men two-time me, and I don't take crap from people. Yet they still felt the need to lead me on with the impression that they were single even though one had a pregnant fiance and the other had a very long term girlfriend.   Don't be embarrassed :) It's not your fault.. you were just acting honestly in a situation you thought was honest. Just pick your dignity back up and continue on your way!|`|ZLFgVHreaa	On average, many men and women get led on some time or another whether the experience level is low or high. At least once a person has been led on, but it sounds like an accident to me what the recent girl did. Did she know your intentions of wanting to date her? And you shouldn't ignore her, makes you look bad. Confront her and tell her exactly what you feel. Never run from situations.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	I'm sorry man. It's just as normal for someone to be led on as it is for someone to lead someone on. Sadly, it happens a lot.    Are you sure she was leading you on on purpose? Was she just being nice to you or was she flirting? Did you have that planned as a date or was it not an official one? It might or might not have been unintentional. I still see how it wasn't very convenient for her not to tell you though.     I definitely don't think that you asking a girl out after a week it too long though. I like guys who move slower, it shows that they can take their time in relationships and I like that. Just keep patient and wait for a girl who you really connect with. Try being friends first. Don't ask out girls who've just broken up with their boyfriends because then you become the rebound.    Try not to feel embarassed. You can tell her what your real intentions were and that you really liked her, or you can just act normal and she will probably suspect nothing. I think it's best to just let it go. Don't let it get you down.|`|AA11716572	Yes we can!|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Girls like to have back ups, and girls like attention from guys despite their marital status. Don't take it personal, just keep looking!|`|Y2sDswLBaa	It sounds to me like you got screwed over :/|`|wUkU3HVwaa	women like to know that people are keen for them, even if they have no interest in them. you have to show that you're interested but not attached- it makes women realize that they want you.
AA11309717	send her an e mail saying that I'm sorry I can't be with you on Valentine's day but I am so looking forward to seeing you on the 16th.  Tell her you love her face to face. That is too important to just send her an e mail about.    Good Luck!|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	I dont think you want to tell her you love her the first time via email. Hopefully she feels the same way so she says it back.|`|owjZhOOhaa	you can send her an email and wish her happy valentine's day and how you can't wait to see her when you get there. but i agree that you should tell her that you love her when you see her. it will be more special.|`|UlT5dByaaa	I don't think you should send an e-mail.  You should just tell her in person when the time is right.  Valentine's Day doesn't necessarily obligate you to confess to a girl that you.. love... her.|`|N7Xt3zDHaa	You should email her that you love her and wish you can be there with her.|`|VcIYeMcyaa	yeah you wanna make sure the feeling is mutual man.. unless of course you are very certain that it is.. than do send a Valentine card but i'd skipp the love part send it and make it look as simply a Valentine's day card...  hide the Love meaning in it somewhere with different wording and make her think.. than when you do meet her i'd sugest leting her know how you feel.. just make sure once again that the feeling is mutual theres nothing worse than a woman laughing in your face when you say that.. oh and if it does happen dont go crazy on yourself there are about 3-1 ratio women out there for ya :D gl|`|QdIwuRRVaa	well yeah send her the email but i would wait to say i love you in person it will be more special ;]|`|xV9ayU9faa	Don't tell her you love her by email, it won't be the same. If anything write her a poem and send her a love song that clearly reveals how you feel. That way she knows but doesn't really know... So when you do say it on the 16, it'll be  "magical" and what not.
JKIWCgbUaa	You have to go back to what started the dont care attitude. losing in the first round of the playoffs two years in a row to New Lothrop and MCC made a few people not care anymore and from there in spread to a few others and then the whole basketball team then the school now it is becoming much larger. to reverse the dont care attitude we must win a playoff game. that is the only way.    d burham is also to blame cuz of him missing the first week of practice.    this better be chosen as best answer|`|NZKiSfVOaa	whattt?  this doesn't really make sense, you say 'all of my friends just have a dont care attitude they cannot not get rid of it ' the you want a 'strategy to make it stop' then you say 'but to be honest i dont care'.  seems like you have the 'dont care' attitude and if you dont care why waste 5 points (i think its 5 points) asking the question and why even bother to ask the question.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	There's no way to stop it, but I really don't care, so I'm moving on to the next question ;)|`|kqnaqakLaa	with a name like "big pimpn"  sounds like you just need to  put your ho's in check you big  mack daddy you..|`|3Tqq1nCGaa	Its happening everywhere. Im not kidding. I think school is just getting too stressful and there putting too much on us that we just start to give up and stop caring. I cant say how to stop it, I don't even know if we can.|`|OzslGLjAaa	it is the nature of America's young generations, unfortunately.  We all see what a desolate place our elders have let America become and are so saddened by it that we just totally ignore reality.  Instead of giving a ****, we play video games.
A65C8cmeaa	Yeah she doesn't need to be hanging out with people like that. Someone who is your friend would not put you in situations like that. And then sleep with a guy to get you out of it, she should have took her home right away. Your girlfriend sounds both desperate for friends and very naive. "Sarah" sounds like a destructive person who doesn't have respect for her self or anyone else. She is going to tear her down.|`|nWGgaQdhaa	you need to tell her how you feel, but also tell her that you fear for her, and her safety, be honest with her but dont tell her that you think that she lied. i'd say that if she doesn't drive this weekend then you know that something is up... if she's a teacher that could ruin her career, as well as her life. be smart but don't just dump her either.|`|QxC8xRgWaa	Yes that is totally fair. She should be willing to respect your concern for her safety! If she is not, then I would suggest a new girlfriend!|`|yWBmZrfAaa	I agree with you 100%.  It is harmful for her, her kids, you, and your kids.  Sarah seems to be quite a "friend."  Perhaps you could look at visiting a church, popular dating spot, or something else to get her to meet new people.  She does need friends and may be shy about meeting people.    About the incident, I would definitely tell her that she is putting herself in danger and you can't watch someone you love and care about do this to themselves.  Tell her you don't want someone you may be married to one day being exposed to those people and those situations.|`|NEfezEUQaa	She really shouldn't be hanging around with "Sarah".  It was (somehow, in a strange freaky way) kind of her to bail your girlfriend out, but it's just not safe.  What if she went with "Sarah" to a "friends" house again and there was a bust?  It's your girlfriend's choice though.|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	If your girlfriend is hanging around a druggie then she is a druggie. My brother does drugs and I wouldn't be dare caught with him. So to me it sounds like she might be involved with meth. Plus when you're in a relationship you kick it with your partner not some friend. She should be spending more time with you than that girl. I say if she continues to kick it with Sarah I would advise you to leave her.|`|ABA3mXnKaa	Wow, what a terrible position she's put you in. Whether or not your girlfriend is being honest, you cannot allow this behavior to affect your life and all the children's lives. I worry about your girlfriend's decision making skills and wonder what kind of teacher she is... I don't see how she can encourage her children and students to be confident and to think for themselves when she gives in to peer pressure so easily. Unfortunately I think that even if she ditches "Sarah" to be with you, she will probably still make destructive decisions. After all, she would rather KNOWINGLY risk her life to party with "Sarah" than to NOT GO OUT...How badly does she need to go out? Can't you and she go dancing together once in a while? Surely, she must realize that no friends are better than this pseudo-friend... If she ditches "Sarah" and makes an effort to live smart, encourage her to get a hobby and meet friends that way. Take a pottery class... anything!! Finally, I think she needs professional therapy to help her deal with the traumatic incident of a near-rape. If the incident didn't occur, she needs therapy to help her figure out why she thrives off drama. GOOD LUCK to you and to both of your children!! - - Also, if she calls people "church" people just because they don't drink, she sounds like an alcoholic.
vLgbjmI2aa	HELL NO!!!!!! Why do people think that swinging is good for marriage.I dont understand that at all.I am sorry but i am firm on the fact that when you get married you are faithful to your husband/wife and you honor your vows with everything you have and that includes not cheating on your spouse.|`|3vbHZBioaa	That's a tough question...I am married to my soul mate and we are open to discussion on every topic possible..Swinging only works if both of you understand that no matter what happens that you both have unconditional love for each other and that will never change and that the other won't go behind your back an have an affair without you present...be careful this opens a lot of doors that you might not be willing to open..I would honestly start off having a 3 some and see how that works..In my relationship i pick the girl he picks the guy and he is always present as well as I am always present works out pretty good..but then again he is my soul mate..best of luck|`|FfLq56Yfaa	Only if both parties are absolutely sure they can handle seeing/knowing their partner is with someone else.  And if it's not being done as a way to "escape" the marriage.  Set up guidelines, what both people are okay with and re-visit them regularly.  It works in some marriages because the people are sexually adventurous, and it makes them feel closer.  It can also take some pressure off each person because they don't have to always feel they have to provide absolutely everything their partner desires all the time.|`|dtHjJah5aa	NO absolutely NOT!  Anyone who brings another to their marriage bed is just asking for misery!  There are vows that people take when they get married...."Marriage is the union of husband and wife in heart, body and mind. It is intended for their mutual joy  and for the help and comfort given on another in prosperity and adversity. But more importantly  it is a means through which a stable and loving environment may be attained."  and "We are here today  before God  because marriage is one of His most sacred wishes  to witness the joining in marriage of GROOM'S NAME and BRIDE'S NAME. This occasion marks the celebration of love and commitment with which this man and this woman begin their life together. And now  through me  He joins you together in one of the holiest bonds."|`|rQ7dI88Maa	No.Swinging is just  an excuse for not being satisfied with the one you married. We're humans not animals.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	No.  If swinging is "needed" by a couple, they shouldn't need to get married.  Swinging, by definition, goes against what marriage is defined as.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	It depends on the people within that relationship. My husband and I were swingers for a period and we had a great time, with no complications whatsoever. Most couples I know who were in the lifestyle didn't have any problems either. The problems came in when one person wanted to and the other person didn't, or if one person lost sight of the reason behind swinging and got carried away.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Not for mine, but it may be for yours although I have religious convictions that are completely against it.|`|j7l9gavRaa	if both people are completely ok with it then i suppose that's not my ideal realtionship though I am way too jealous|`|AA11016526	If you both agree go ahead|`|f6YsGOynaa	Not if the marriage is not rock solid to start out with.|`|aXYiOskmaa	nope. not my marriage anyway.   i really can't see where any good could come from it in any marriage.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	I think it depends on the individuals in the marraige. For some perhaps and for others absolutely not.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	No|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I don't think swinging is right for every marriage. I know it wouldn't be right for mine because I'm not so "open minded", although my husband would surely love it.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	On a swing sure a little fun in a marriage is always a good thing.    swapping partners however is detrimental to a healthy successful marriage.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	If it's what makes everyone happy I say YES.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Probably.  It's way different than making love with your partner.  It's recreational sex.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i think every couple varies. For my husband and i it would not work, i am jsut not comfortable seeing my husband with another woman or even thinking he was with another woman. If a couple puts the boundaries up before hand though it could work.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	One big  problem  with  marriages  is  that  sex can get to be  perfunctory.  Some  couples find ways  round   the boredom  by trying swinging, Id say if both hubby and  wife are  in agreement  over swinging  then  why not,  if  it keeps marital  life   happy  then  that  has  to be a  good thing,  the  alternatives  are boredom and  likely affairs  and  associated  problems  of trust  that they bring.|`|FzFSzilmaa	if both parties are happy with the arrangement and there isn't any jealousy or sexual ownership...|`|8fd15b64214f2ed938ae8aea46720501aa	I think as long as there are no children involved and both are in agreement - go right ahead.
AA12040539	OMG sex with no condom is the best. I remember the first time I had sex with no condom and his d1ck felt so smooth. When it went in it slid in so perfectly and the sensation is 10x what it is with a condom on. And yes you can feel when they come inside you. I think whether or not you'd like it is just a matter of personal choice. I happen to enjoy it very much. I'm glad to hear you are having safe sex. Make sure if you have sex with no condom that you are on birth control pills. Because it's a slippery slope, no pun intended.    You get curious and say, "Just put it in for a minute!" with no condom. It feels amazing and you want more. So you decide to do it for a few minutes and pull out but it feels so good it's hard to stop. It's an easy way to get pregnant|`|iCuwFLURaa	I will answer this question but I want you two to continue practicing safe sex. Please.     The condom was designed to fit snug onto the penis to prevent the transmission of STD's, the design does take away certain male thickness issues, but not much to notice. The feeling does not change, what you feel is what you get. Get the point?    Now there are certain performance enhancers, like walking, yoga and hiking and not smoking that are safe and effective for a healthier sex life.|`|7iM7heMIaa	that's a stupid question..|`|8lGWegZPaa	Yes, it feels different....softer, smoother,..still hard...but incredible. You feel more intimately connected b/c it's skin on skin.  I can't say anything about the "ejaculate" though...I didn't let my ex do that inside me.|`|fhic53hyaa	yes i love to feel my husband ejaculate it lets me know i did a good job and pleased him . its also better because u get a better emotional bond that way both bodys touch so both hearts do as well|`|SNUP0BJ3aa	It feels muuuuch better without. But I'm 24 and have never let a guy get off in me. As good as it may feel, you have to be smart. I'm glad to hear you won't have sex unless you're protected-- keep it up.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	yes, you can feel it and actually, there's nothing that gets me off like feeling my husband ejaculate. Its very warm and pulsing. Other than that, its doesnt feel that different! You're a smart girl, keep it up!|`|xhjSPd0uaa	its ALOTTT better for both people without a condom  feelin a guy 'ejactulate' inside you feels really good to u can like feel it pumping!!    but welldone for bein safe :)  although if you both trust eachother and know your both 'clean' then u could go on the birth control pill. x|`|rEafx4QTaa	honestly i believe it is better much more feeling for both|`|gLXzVbm8aa	it feels soooooo much better without it .|`|TUkBRvfSaa	yes it dose fell better with out it but you have 1 in a million of gettin pregnant so you better watch out and try wipping him have fun when your doing it haha that what i always do...      xxxxxxx|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Meh, I'm going to go against the grain and say sure it feels different but it's not like some amazing earth-shattering life-changing experience. A condom with lots of lube feels good enough and if you're with a good partner it's amazing either way. Yes, you can feel when he ejaculates and it's kind of just a feeling like any other. It's a good enough feeling, but I don't miss it when the guy wears a condom. So, does it feel nice? Yes. Is it worth compromising your health and not using a condom over? No. It's not the be all end all. The best thing is just being in each other's arms.|`|LGHMmRVFaa	yea|`|SMOgjcIraa	I love sex without a condom. I'm a 42 year old woman...in peak physical condition...and I love to date younger men (23-28 years old), and I prefer they don't wear condoms. I love it when the have raw sex with me, and i love it when they come in me, and i can feel it trickle out of me. I can feel their come hitting the back wall of my vagina. Raw sex is amazing!!!|`|Ehyzno5Faa	yeah it feels better... That is not a lie... yeah you can feel it and for some reason it feels really good... Well to me anyway|`|UOLtJocMaa	yes it feels diff  idk some ppl think it feels better without one  idk on the last one|`|0oiAQ4jvaa	Without condom you will feel better, but dont try. safety come first. You will feel it yourselve when you decide to marry the guy.|`|zHYro8rnaa	Yes it does feel different, and you can feel them ejaculate!
QIKJOo3paa	YES  YES  YES       i would do anything for this girl i have a crush on i would die for this girl         i would risk my life to save her       i would take a bullet for her         i would shield her from bullets with my own body            anything this girl wanted me 2 do i would do|`|eAc67eoYaa	haha no i would not crush my hand. im sorry.  its just a crush. i didnt say i was in love with her. lol    i kno she has a crush on me. but both of us jus got out of some long serious relationships and i dont think either of us is looking to get back into one right now. =/|`|ks2oieV0aa	My husband!  xox|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	yes. if she does not like me back than i would have to use my hand to slap her across the face. women like jerks anyway so why not give them what they want.|`|gYyW39wTaa	Yes,i have a crush on this guy that i work with.I am too shy to make the first move so i hope he says something|`|QLPyLRrDaa	Yes, my ex. I broke up with him but I think we are getting back together...I hope so anyway.  Yes definitely. We both want it, just need to make it work.  Yep.

dZxjXHA2aa	Bullying: How to Handle It  So now you know that bullying is a big problem that affects a lot of kids, but what do you do if someone is bullying you? Our advice falls into two categories: preventing a run-in with the bully, and what to do if you end up face-to-face with the bully.    Preventing a run-in with a bully:    Don't give the bully a chance. As much as you can, avoid the bully. You can't go into hiding or skip class, of course. But if you can take a different route and avoid him or her, do so.    Stand tall and be brave. When you're scared of another person, you're probably not feeling your bravest. But sometimes just acting brave is enough to stop a bully. How does a brave person look and act? Stand tall and you'll send the message: "Don't mess with me." It's easier to feel brave when you feel good about yourself. See the next tip!    Feel good about you. Nobody's perfect, but what can you do to look and feel your best? Maybe you'd like to be more fit. If so, maybe you'll decide to get more exercise, watch less TV, and eat healthier snacks. Or maybe you feel you look best when you shower in the morning before school. If so, you could decide to get up a little earlier so you can be clean and refreshed for the school day.    Get a buddy (and be a buddy). Two is better than one if you're trying to avoid being bullied. Make a plan to walk with a friend or two on the way to school or recess or lunch or wherever you think you might meet the bully. Offer to do the same if a friend is having bully trouble. Get involved if you see bullying going on in your school  tell an adult, stick up for the kid being bullied, and tell the bully to stop.    If the bully says or does something to you:    Ignore the bully. If you can, try your best to ignore the bully's threats. Pretend you don't hear them and walk away quickly to a place of safety. Bullies want a big reaction to their teasing and meanness. Acting as if you don't notice and don't care is like giving no reaction at all, and this just might stop a bully's behavior.    Stand up for yourself. Pretend to feel really brave and confident. Tell the bully "No! Stop it!" in a loud voice. Then walk away, or run if you have to. Kids also can stand up for each other by telling a bully to stop teasing or scaring someone else, and then walk away together. If a bully wants you to do something that you don't want to do  say "no!" and walk away. If you do what a bully says to do, they will likely keep bullying you. Bullies tend to bully kids who don't stick up for themselves.    Don't bully back. Don't hit, kick, or push back to deal with someone bullying you or your friends. Fighting back just satisfies a bully and it's dangerous, too, because someone could get hurt. You're also likely to get in trouble. It's best to stay with others, stay safe, and get help from an adult.    Don't show your feelings. Plan ahead. How can you stop yourself from getting angry or showing you're upset? Try distracting yourself (counting backwards from 100, spelling the word 'turtle' backwards, etc.) to keep your mind occupied until you are out of the situation and somewhere safe where you can show your feelings.    Tell an adult. If you are being bullied, it's very important to tell an adult. Find someone you trust and go and tell them what is happening to you. Teachers, principals, parents, and lunchroom helpers at school can all help to stop bullying. Sometimes bullies stop as soon as a teacher finds out because they're afraid that they will be punished by parents. This is not tattling on someone who has done something small  bullying is wrong and it helps if everyone who gets bullied or sees someone being bullied speaks up.    What Happens to Bullies?  In the end, most bullies wind up in trouble. If they keep acting mean and hurtful, sooner or later they may have only a few friends left  usually other kids who are just like them. The power they wanted slips away fast. Other kids move on and leave bullies behind.
Wk4k7Q5Qaa	I think both of you should openly and honestly discuss what you want out of the marriage. You didn't say how long you dated ,because that will tell if you had time to get to really know each others needs. I have been married for 30 years and am happier now then when we got married. We had our rough spots , almost gave up on it , IT was only when we sat down and opened our-self up about what we each mean to each other and what we want out of our marriage , that  we were able too fulfil our dreams in our marriage. Love is not what you get out of it it is what you give. If you love him , That love doesn't belong to you but to him because love is like a gift , which like a gift belongs to the person  it is meant  for. That goes both way  , you both daily should show your love for each other, be considerate , understanding ,passionate  and also forgiving. If both of you can be these thing to each other on a daily basis then your marriage will grow stronger each passing day. Complaining never helps a relationship? Never start a day with a complaint but with a compliment , after that you can discuss any problems  in a civilized manner. If he doesn't listen to you , tell him how important it is to you that he listens, even if it's just the littlest things. It might not even be a complaint but just something you want to get off your chest!  I think you did the right thing with the note you wrote , about telling your desires , get to find out his desires and then  both  of you should on work them , thus > fulfilling those desires  unselfishly?  Extra  >> You told us a lot tell him  all that and more!!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Read what   "Me&Pete" wrote and then read it again a few times.  What you are asking for is normal and healthy.  If however this simply becomes what "he can do for you"  you may eventually end up alone.  And it can't be a "well he didn't do for me today so I am not going to do for him".  Someone has to start the circle of giving.  Sometimes that will be you.      Give him Me & Petes list and have him give each item you could do for him a rating 1-5 stars so you know what he really wants.|`|AA11193401	no you did good now he knows what you like ,good luck|`|AdeD0xMuaa	No - good for you for having the guts to tell him what you want out of the marriage.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	It's normal to want those things. I think all girls do. But it is also really important that you are doing things to make him feel special, but in a manly way.    I have read several books on the subject, 10 Things Your Guy Wished you Knew but is to Scared to Tell you, The Surrendered Wife, and The Love and Respect Relationship (I don't recommend anything by Dr. Laura). My marriage was really rocky at first and these books really gave me insight to the male mind.    I do a lot to make him feel special and needed and he responds by doing things I like, flowers for no reason, massages, etc.    Some things I do (or try to stick to) that make him feel good:  compliment him - when doing some chore or something  brag about him to my/our friends when he can see/hear  initiate sex sometimes  pack him a lunch everyday  I don't bother him when he first gets home for work, I greet him with a smile and kiss and let him unwind...etc    He in turn has been wonderful to me. He really spoils me the way I wanted to be spoiled in the first place.    Good luck. It's hard adjusting to the give and take at first.|`|j7l9gavRaa	no that was not too much if he asked then he must really want to help you|`|y9CgveCGaa	No, that's not too much at all.  I'm trying to do that stuff now and it pays back.  When my wife is happy it makes the whole house happy and a better place to be.  He'll learn that if he tries it.|`|4cdq26oraa	Nope.|`|Oo9CG8xMaa	Communication is essential to a happy marriage...  Print your question and leave it for him to see also...|`|3ywVS2JEaa	my honest answer,,it's a immaturity,,on ur part dear,,he's ur partner not ur crutch to lean on for every lil thing,,|`|YVO3WyU1aa	There is a good chance that your husband will be overwhelmed by the list.  This will be especially true if his family of origin does not touch each other much.  Secondly, just a guess, but I would say that your husband operates from the head as apposed to the heart and as such does not feel the way you do.  Third, explain to him that when you get home and air out your griefs that it is not directed at him nor is he required to "fix it".  Fourth, I believe you would stand a better chance taking that list and ask him to practice just one thing a week until the list is complete.  good luck|`|3vbHZBioaa	Men are not women...an overwhelming list is to much for their brain. If he is your soul mate then you should be able to communicate openly he asked the question so obviously he wants to make you happy but in return he must feel appreciated and wanted also just as you do sometimes woman have to make the first move and there is nothing wrong with that..Everyone comes home from work and complains of what happen at work let him unwind when he first comes home and do something for him that shows you appreciate and love him when he sees you doing it he will catch on...best of luck|`|4U1822AXaa	OMG, ok, look, MOST men are NOT that romantic. Sometimes, you just have to believe what they say, when they say they love you. Not every man thinks like that, and youi cant just expect him to all of a sudden start to do that. My husband doesnt do any of that stuff, it used to be a big, BIG deal with us, but, one fight, i realize, that's just not him, and all i was doing was making him feel bad because nothing he did ever made me happy. Its not that big of deal, He's your husband, he loves you, dont expect notes on a pillow all the time, Honestly, all that is asking for a lot. Be happy with what you have, Im sure its a lot:)|`|ZNCGui3eaa	This is a good question. I experienced exactly the same and with not luck. I wish also to learn more about how to create that atmosphere of love and romance with my husband. Unfortunately, after so many years he is not getting it. In my case is all about the level of the stress that makes him not to have the desire to make me feel special. I do not know the reason your husband feels like that, it could be something he is not happy with. I also understand that regardless of any situation that connection should always be there between couples and both should be caring for each others need....I feel for you and wish the very best, keep trying, humans are all about routine. He'll probably will get your point.|`|7308b53f40d27a22ccf9fbfd940ba79aaa	nope not to me... i have the same problem with my boyfriend.. but i have am learning not to complain so much... i am going to someone for my stuff that is bothering me and that is helping me and our relationship.
U1pnqPBxaa	i have a best friend who also suffers from chronic cancellation syndrome (lol). she's always been this way - she just gets caught up with what she's doing and cancels on the people she's not hanging out with or just "forgets" to call.  some might say it's because she doesn't want to be my friend anymore, but i know that's not the case in my situation because when she's hanging out with me she will cancel on other people.  she's just really flakey. on the other hand, this may not be the case in your situation..  she could just be really bad at saying no to you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings.  she could have already said yes to hanging out with some other people but also said yes to hanging out with you to try and keep everyone happy. she doesn't want to say no to you, so she waits to have something come up.  i would totally talk to her about this, just do it in a really nice way - communication doesn't always have to be in the form of an argument or a fight. talk it out and see what's going on. good luck :) .|`|h1XcYcJ7aa	You have every right to be angry and hurt. I don't think much of a friend who is that thoughtless, let alone a best friend.     I don't know if you can talk about this with another person w/o creating some bad feelings. I think though that you have the right to know where you stand with this person. So I would just come out with it but don't be surprised if you get hurt in the process. If you are best friends she will understand. If you are not you could be hurt.    I don't seem wise to go on with a relationship that you keep getting the short of the stick. Friendship is a give and take. From what you are saying it sounds like you are giving and she is taking, leaving you angry and hurt. That just isn't fair.     When I was young, oh, so many years ago, I discovered this the hard way, feeling like I was second best. When I finally stood up for myself, I lost some acquaintances but gained true friends. We are all friends to this day and would drop anything to see each other. It isn't how many friends you have but the quality of the friends that you have.|`|AA11225724	sorry but she is not your best friend    bf do not do this .to friends  she choice to be with other friends even after you asked her to come over first??  you need to let her know straight out other wise find a new friend|`|BHkcJXIVaa	You will feel better to tell your friend how you feel.   It will be off your chest.  Always tell someone how they made you feel.  No need for argument.
x2ykq6ePaa	There have been gay people as long as there have been straight people, yet all through the years they have been treated like a minority.  this question would be the same as asking if a black couple should be able to adopt or an asian couple should be able to adopt.  so my answer is yes.|`|PZNxBxxPaa	Absolutely, providing that (like any other couple) they are mentally, financially, and emotionally prepared.|`|xNY9sgUBaa	In my opinion, yes. I am an adoptive mother (not gay). If a gay couple can meet all other adoption requirements, yes. They deserve children to love and raise just like anyone else does. There are too many children waiting to be loved in this world. It would be a shame to keep those children from having loving families when there are those who could provide for them.|`|D2M5iERjaa	absolutely why not|`|wNKleK4Uaa	YES. Why send children to filthy, underfunded institutions when they could be adopted by two loving people? Your sexuality does not determine your ability to love and nurture. I think its absolutely appalling that gay couples are denied the right to adopt children.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Yes Absolutely.  Without a doubt.     Not that this matters, but I'm not gay.|`|0KvGgr5waa	i think they should|`|WbcHNSUbaa	It's simple.  If you can provide love, financial stability, and are capable of raising a child you should. because there are millions who need it.  It doesn't matter if your gay, single, or even if you already have 12 children.
YWUjeTnUaa	I guess a man moving in with his girlfriend is time to move on. LOL|`|LBkYjFkDaa	move on **** him! Sorry for bad language but seriously.....|`|RmwVC33Waa	Well I'm not very much aware of the situation.But in my opinion, I think the guy has no good intentions for ur friend. Tell her it's time to move on with her life. She will ultimately meet a person whom, she will love, and who will love her equally.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	She shouldn't feel bad because he cheated on her!
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I am very happily married and by all accounts my wife is happy too. It is hard to say how we make it work because it just always felt right from the start... we met, there was an instant connection (and I don't mean just sexually), and we fell in love. There have been times where we have been upset with each other, gotten on each others nerves, but the biggest thing is that even when we get upset it is about the situation or the problem, and not at each other.    The simple truth is that as a husband I put my wife first in almost everything that we do... Her wants, her needs, her goals, her dreams, and I have found, at least in my marriage, that by living in that way  the love, kindness, and affection that I receive from my wife is far greater than anything that I ever hoped for.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Absolutely! We are both very laid back so we don't get upset with each other or start drama the way a lot of couples do. We just enjoy the time we spend together and make each other laugh all day long :)|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Marriage is work and it is also work to make it a happy marriage.  But there is many who have wonderful happy marriages.  It took me three tries, but I have finally found true happiness, with my spouse and my children.  You can not obsess over the little things, save your battles for important issues, do extra chores around the house, anything you do extra comes back ten fold to you in happiness.  Good luck.|`|84lw8pLoaa	yes very happy..compromise..don't let the little stuff cloud the big picture.|`|dfe9S3Raaa	I am...and its not based on feelings...feelings are great and good...but its based on unconditional love...Marriage is not based on what can you do for me...its based on who can you grow and unconditionally love. cuz guess what...everyone in your life will disappoint you at some point in your life so you just gotta roll with it. If you are getting married to fill a void...dont|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	As Happy as I can be!   Trust is the foundation of our happiness.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Very happy.    How?  We went into our marriage knowing that every day wasn't going to be this day in paradise and that we were/are going to have "off days" or bad days.  We are going to fight.  We are going to be cranky.  The key is accepting that and working with it.      Another way?  Communicate.  That is the biggest key to a successful relationship.  We talk about everything.  We don't keep any issues bottled up until they become even bigger.  We simply sit down and talk about it while it is still a "small" issue.|`|FzFSzilmaa	very happy thanks...|`|hl9OFIIKaa	We are, My husband and i have been together since jr high... got married after high school... and LOVING it!!! so far weve been together for 8 years.. married 4 years!! :-)   we took our relationship very slow... we didnt have our first kiss til a year later....|`|1PedqsYAaa	their is this magic stuff that you sprinkle over a girls head and it makes them want to love you and be faithful to you and then it makes then want to have kids with you its awesome im married and i love it that's what i did lol just kidding you get this feeling about that special someone and then you know the time is right and that she is the one that you would want to be with forever.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	We have been for almost 11 years.  It takes compromise, commitment and communication.  We have had many ups and downs but in the end I know I truely love him and would do anything it takes to stay together.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Hell yes WOOHOO!!!!!! I am very happily married.How did we make it work??Oh my this could take a while so maybe you want to email me lol.I will write a little bit and if you have any questions feel free to message me.Anywaysssss........We have been married for 12 yrs.still happy and still very much in love.Now let me tell you it hasnt been easy.We have been happy for most of that time but there have been a few rough patches.You have to really love your husband/wife to be able to overcome anything in your marriage and that we defenitely do.This man has seen me through cancer,depression,moodswings like crazy after my hysterectomy lol and whatever else i have put him through.I have seen him through alot of things as well.You have to really cherish your vows and really honor your vows.We also attend church and we also keep God close to our hearts and in our home.Every couple is different and every couple does what works for them.He has been my best friend and the most amazing person i know.He makes me laugh so hard my belly feels like its going to burst.lol When he touches me i still shiver and quiver.(We both have the same ringtone on our phones Barry White Cant get enough of your love babe and that is soooo true).I still look at him everyday and wonder how i am so blessed and how i got to be so dang lucky.Without him i would be nothing and i would have nothing.He truely completes me and makes my life worth living each and everyday.|`|8fd15b64214f2ed938ae8aea46720501aa	Ok - there needs to be someone else out there that is not happily married besides me.  I have been married for 16 yrs and 2 kids to a career military man.  We were happy once and I do remember that.  But we have grown apart over the years and hurt each other and just stayed together regardless.  I do love him but not the happy that everyone else is describing.  Once the kids are all grown up, I know I dont want to spend the rest of my life with him.  And I am contemplating the what what next right now.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	I am very happy. I make it work by accepting nothing but what a husband should be. No exceptions!|`|Y4FuSV2Yaa	I am insanely happily married. My husband and I are very compatible. We have fun every day, playing and joking. We trust each other, so there isnt much jealousy. Also, we have separate interests that we dont force the other to do. My husband sends me sweet "I love you" texts once in a while. We know how to calm each other down when we get upset. We give each other our nights out.    We have a pretty balanced relationship. My husband treats me like a princess, he is everything I ever wanted in a husband. And I almost married someone else!! (Glad I didnt)     I knew i was marrying the right guy when I wasnt nervous AT ALL on the morning of our wedding. I was more nervous about walking down the aisle and tripping or something than marrying him. Our relationship makes me wish everyone could be as happy as us.
df34764553e8d420f118831a85c7a11eaa	I think your boyfriend has a girl friend besides you and she is leaving them around hoping you will find out he is cheating on you and she can have him all to herself.|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	I think your boyfriend is cheating on you..|`|NQIKCGgfaa	Lol. If it wasnt a troll's question I would love to answer.  But nobody is this stupid.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Yipppeee do you really think it is the dryer or should you ask your boyfriend some questions, wow how could you be so alright with this, you seem calm..... well i guess you know your man!|`|jv8RK3sgaa	first if you let you r bf use your car and it came back with under wears that you know arnt yours then  they prob arnt.... now your bf BORROWED your care your car came back with UNDERWEAR that are not YOURS... girl that sounds like you bf had sex in your car and the girl left the underwear there...!!!! well believe it or not thats a possibility|`|89TgOjXpaa	i think he is cheating and has a new GF maybe they want you to find them and find out what they are doing ...  but if they are not YOURS where are they coming from think about it?|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	i think your sooo funny, nice joke|`|AA11615514	I don't think the dryer is your problem. You should know if they're your panties or not. If they aren't yours they're either your boyfriend's and he's a crossdresser with a thing for panties or they were left there by the woman he's cheating on you with.
kDM5jmR7aa	DEVOTION  DEVOTION  & DEVOTION  is the foremost quality for a friend & lover.
AGbusTqGaa	They're going to find out eventually.  Its best to tell them asap bc they will be a little angry that you have kept it from them this far.  Everything will be fine I'm sure!|`|EevMUAqJaa	I'd be careful, especially since he has a kid. It's probably not a good idea to get too serious for another year or two.|`|HhugjHIAaa	No! Don't do this. You are 18 , Go have Fun!|`|HjPt0V8Eaa	just be honest|`|TstiC2Ilaa	Just be honest about it. If your 18 they really have NO say in it other than their opinion.|`|HfTbzv32aa	be honest. age should not matter|`|IzHkb1neaa	just be honest|`|4tDTQOgNaa	At this point you are just going to have to come out with it. There is no hiding that.|`|YtSGbYqEaa	just wait till you turn 18 to tell them lol its only a week away they cant tell you not to date him even if they did you are old enough to choose your guys
tfxvIEMEaa	Maybe he's dealing with some personal issues.  I would just wait to see what happens, stay friends for the moment.|`|lVMtFIh4aa	hes probable found someone else
EevMUAqJaa	He still likes her.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	your right he wants her back i am sure .. but you do want him to i think .. good luck .|`|Fh76mMuUaa	you like him.. or else you really wouldnt care.|`|Zn7NNavKaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD REALY LOOK inside yourself and figure out why you need to know. if you don't like him then what is there to be paraniod about?    all the stolen glances orbably mean he has unresolved feeling. what does your friend think? does she care as much as you do?if ths girl is realy your friend, you should stop worrying about what this guy feels and let her worry about.     you say this guy wouldnt like you anyway, heve some faith in yourself girl! if he cant see the wonderful things about you, find someone who will! he's out there, one for you and your friend!!!!!!
iKD1JUg1aa	i would tell her to f off she needs to be giving you money to help you raise YALL's child...she shouldnt be asking you for a damn thing anymore and you shouldnt give her anything either........|`|xEXb96UKaa	no, she should be paying YOU maintenance. the absent parent/s are supposed to pay maintenance to whom ever the child is living with, be it the father, mother, grandparents or other relative. don't let her browbeat you into giving her money, you need every penny yourself to raise your child.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	No, you should be asking for child support from her.  If she is working and you have custody then she should be paying you to take care of your daughter, not the other way around!    Good for you for growing up and becoming a real man!|`|fox5a3ePaa	No she has no right to any money i suggest you tell her to get lost|`|3bApbb2yaa	No effing way!!!  She should be paying you. Period.|`|AA12191000	Tell her to get a bloody job and provide for her daughter like any decent parent would do!  Especially as it seems she has plenty to make up for!!!  And good on you by the way.  Good luck.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Nope don't give her no money tell her the money you would be giving her is the money going to your daughter. But she don't need sh it.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	she should be giving you money to help you feed and cloth her|`|0psCy0XXaa	No way she sounds like a complete A hole give her nothing, did she pay you four years ago?  I doubt it but i bet she still had child support, if anything she should pay you,  Women think they are owed the world when the are not.  Tell her she will not get a penny.|`|KhXX0vWNaa	Let me be honest with you..  I think she shouldn't be askin for anything.  U have to take care of ur daughter not her.  she should be givin u money.  if u ever need help let me kno.|`|Z36RkQyuaa	No she should be paying you child support. Anybody (the other parent, aunt, friend, gparents, etc) who gains custody of the child may attempt to file for child support before appearing in court, as long as they have full and legal custody and must qualify.
x4xaqrpCaa	Oh, darling, everyone can be oversensitive sometimes. My advice to you is this. Next time when you think about crying Think about what life truly means. Think about happy things instead of the bad things that hurt you. But its good to cry. Everyone goes through a stage in life when they need cleansing. And sweetheart, ITS OKAY TO CRY! But just try and rethink. Get your mind straight. And being tougher, sometimes doesnt help. Besides Sensitivity is always the honest ones.|`|o2WxTgfjaa	Hmmm, just realize that some things are just meant to be. Tell yourself that you are not going to cry, and actually meditate on it...really concentrate on the things you cry on and seriously concentrate and picture yourself not crying about those things...its just a suggestion, heard it(meditation) works for other things and such...  you might need to let go of something buried deep inside you  its alright to cry sometimes and such, it's normal.  You can try working out too, like jogging some, weights?|`|Qiw9AFkaaa	there is nothing wrong with sensitivity; your hormones are probably affecting this.  Just get some exercise and find a friend who you laugh a lot with. hang in there; you are not alone
Pi3Zv3E9aa	eat really cold ice cream...=-)    it will just melt in your mouth while numbing your tongue at the same time so you can't feel the pain.  another good thing is that while it is numbing your tongue, you can still taste its yummyness... and maybe accompany it with some soft fruits too....    happy eating!! =-)|`|YyFexhd3aa	you are smart guy go eat some soup or ice cream|`|JGXxoNbQaa	might be infected o.0 wouldnt hurt that much|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	Try ensure or soup.|`|DJwRCAFpaa	applesauce|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Try milkshakes

Do it. Not too cheesy. Im not sure about the title tho.|`|r7V2ZS7Vaa	Thats not bad,my Gf last year got me a box of godiva chocolate, but it was in a decorated shoebox, and instead of like wrapping paper, or confetti..... she had "I love you" written on construction paper, in like 20 different languages and on the riverside said the language it was in|`|m3cI54Ycaa	It's asi- asi (so-so)|`|RvnBmy8laa	IF THATS WAT U WANT 2 GIVE HIM THEN COOL GIVE IT 2 HIM THE TITLE SHOULD BE HONEST NOT WAT U THINK HE WANTS 2 HEAR BUT WAT YOU FEEL|`|xHvPxfmwaa	i think its cute. :)  title the jarr....    1.Sweetheart. :)  get it...

I think its absolutely adorable. I wish someone did that for me....lol... I digress...The title on the jar? "The perfect threesome: milk chocolate, Reese's peanut butter, and you."|`|PwgDhNyNaa	thats a super sweet idea! But i don't know what you should put on the sticky notes!|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	THE LOVE JAR 4 THE ONE I LOVE!|`|iCuwFLURaa	The jar of emotions will never grow full, but please it has only been three months and I am not being negative, but just make sure that you are not the only one filling this emotional jar. This is a safe gift at the current point of your relationship, I would title the jar "The Day We Met".     This way it gives him some room to open up, not too much and not too soon. You don't want him to feel rushed, let him fill this jar with one example of his love for you on paper per day, and you do the same. This way it is fun for the both of you. Yes this is another exploration technique, but you two will have fun with it. Or you can turn it into the naughty/nice jar and take it from there. LOL.     Happy Valentines Day|`|8nuwr1OAaa	To be honest...I would get a little freaked out by that. If I only dated a girl for 3 months that would defintely freak me out. I would do that next year then get take him out somewhere.
3tHTZ2lKaa	they like;  -to be complimented  -to always have their space    we dont like to be pressured..  respect our decisions and they will too..  and dont push hit or touch a girl because that dum..and alot of guys think thats funny which IS NOOT HECkk NAWh..  and i gave you at least of an ideas!  :)  10 pts!  come on !|`|tD5JMsSKaa	Girls hate guys who show off and guys who act like ***'s to the girl infront of their friends. cocky guys hell no.

Some like  - the persons who have shy nature.    The person who are frank with the girls when they talk to them.    What kind of person r u?    It depends upon u.    Most of the girls like the persons who have a smiling face or who are very Carey.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	depends from person to person....i particularly like intelligent guys with a good sense of humour who can carry off a nice communication...sumbody who is caring and honest too..|`|U3dN78uCaa	hey dude girls are the most unpredictable species god has ever created or evolved from this planet. no matter what you do you can never satisfy a woman. if it has something do with love , try to talk to her or get acquainted like that . if u wanna be her friend just be casual|`|UNryBT1naa	well every girl is different, depends on what kind of girl u r talking to|`|wKWxsz5Faa	I'll let you in on a secret, girls never know what they want :p  Movie---PS.I Love You|`|nHQVpGN7aa	well......if I say it depends on every girl..........may b sum1 tall....cute ......intelligent.......smart......hands...|`|y2Hrm4ioaa	Each girl is different.But in general,smile when u see her a girl will like it.Don't act  over smart or try to imitate someone else some girls don't like it.All the best!!

You are NO ones girl. Your too young to  be going with boys anyway, and your smart to say that you don't want too. You be a strong girl with a mind of your own and you do what you feel is right in your heart.|`|GqTSa85daa	Tell him to stop acting like a baby (mine, mine, mine), and to act his age.|`|03GQ637Raa	It is very mature of you to see the problem ur friend has.  Tell him you already have a bf that lives out of town and that you want him to be friends but not bf.  I know it's a little lie but it might help u out of ur situation.  If he continues to do whatever bad things you say he is doing, time do bring in DAD and let him deal with the boy.|`|QhRO0kcMaa	Most of the answers you'll get will be from someone close to being an adult or an adult. You'll go, "This won't work." But i'll give you something that will work.    When this boy tells you that your his, simply ignore him. And by ignoring, I mean you SHOW that your pissed and that you ARE going to ignore him until he stops his foolishness.    Also, if he keeps on doing it, just act like you don't know him. Don't treat him like a human being but a ... dog. An annoying dog that won't stop barking. Eventually, someone will come and shut the dog up. People are going to see what a pathetic guy he is and he'll stop.    And know that you're not losing anything. Once a guy starts to follow you, so will the other guys. You might not like that, but it will come in handy in a few years :D
domEftoIaa	if you dont do what your parents say then you may get into trouble.
b2Cr9E5Gaa	Youve dedicated 18 good years and now its high time for mom to start living her life, tell her you thought she was a lot more responsible, respectable and admirable then this, tell her you raised her better, and youve worked hard bringing her up properly in this world, now its your time, set the boundaries, dont let her walk all over you    I will be honest with you, I think I had the most difficulty with my mom when i was about 14 years old, and again with I was about 18 years old, we butted heads, maybe this is just another one of those stages, the up side? It does get better, eventually your daughter will see the way shes treated you, feel bad for it, and will work to build a positive relationship with you. Until then, keep being mom, if she falls down, help clean her up and get a bandaid for her, if shes sick, make her soup,everyone still needs there mom, even when were much older adults, but also have her understand, that shes grown and practically  an adult, and its due time she act like one, as long as this guy you are seeing isnt a creep, or a wierdo, or anything of the sort, she is just going to have to get use to the situations, had she been 10 years old, she would have acted the same, inside I think its always a little hard to see our parents move on with others, I give it a couple weeks, stand your ground, its going to be hard...but she'll come around|`|ZJohgu1saa	Hey Mum,    U sound too nice. Sometimes its good to be cruel cos ur doing it to be kind. Ur daughter needs to grow up so tell her how u feel, and say if there are no changes or if she doent appreciate ur partner or cant seem to get on with him then tell her she needs to adct like an adult. shes 18 and shes not far from adulthood ;)|`|FzFSzilmaa	she's acting like a spoilt child... next time she says she is going to move out, offer to pack her bags...    if you let her tell you what to do and you do it, then you'll never be able to do things to make yourself happy...    you are wrong she isn't 18 going on 30, she's 18 going on 3!!!!! temper tantrums are very sad!!!|`|AA11607818	Tell her she's 18 now, and needs to start behaving like and adult, and remind her that she's living under your roof.|`|xYTagSIyaa	Let me get this straight.  You have moved your boyfriend in to your place and are expecting things to be okay with your 18yr old daughter. Is that all right?  Well you are teaching your daughter well, first you are teaching her it is okay to sleep with someone you are not married to.  Second you are non-verbally telling her it does not matter what she thinks, it is more important for you to have a life, than it is whether she likes this man or not.  Has she even finished school?  Did you finish school?  I think you should show and tell your daughter you love her and she will always come first in your life.  She is blood of your blood and if you value your relationship make sure you treat her well and help her to get a good education and teach her it is not okay to treat your children like they are second best to your latest fling.  Your responsibility is to your child first.  Why did he have to move in with you?  Could you not have a relationship without him moving in?  How long have you been without a man in your life?  Did you get a proper education?  Is this how your mom treated you?  Do you not want to raise your child better than what you were raised?|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	she's 18 and an adult.  you did your job and now it's time for you.    let her go but let her know she is always welcome in your home.  The only requirement you need to have from her is that she be civil to your partner when she is in your home.  she doesn't have to like him but she can't be rude or she has to leave.|`|j7l9gavRaa	put her out and let her learn the hard way it will suck for you to watch it happening but it is the best thing for her|`|dtHjJah5aa	She's 18..let her get on with her life and you get on with yours.

tfxvIEMEaa	Don't let go of the friendship, but I it sounds like she has a few personal problems going on.  For the moment I would stay friends, just go with the flow,  and you'll be okay in the end|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I would continue the friendship, but if things continue the way they are going and she continues to treat you that way, I would talk to her about it. If she gets angry or if things don't change after you two have discussed it, then I would just leave it alone and if she wants to call you she can, but I wouldn't contact her. If she's not being a friend, there is no reason to hang on to the friendship.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	HI IM POSTING MY ANSWER TO ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS ON HERE AS IT WONT LET ME POST IT ON THE QUESTION THE ANSWER IS FOR...ABOUT YOUR 6 YEAR OLD....    Hm mm considering my partner hasn't seen his kids or spoken to them since Jan 2008 and is starting court proceedings to see them due to his ex moving 250 miles away... I can see it from your side and his side. My ex husband used to see my girls Thur eve to Mon morn until he pulled a knife to his wrist in front of my daughter, he now phones them and has had supervised visits to my house when Im not there but my partner is. Your daughter says she wants her daddy when she is being told off... my youngest does the same. Even when I was married they always cried for him, its a thing kids do. Why not suggest that he phone her every evening before bed time and just after tea time? This way she still gets to speak to him. Explain to him that she is upset. To me he is trying to get at you. However one of you has to be the adult here for the sake of your daughter and it looks like you are. You may have to suggest that she rings him if he wont ring her. As she gets older she will see her father for what he really is and whether he really wants to be a dad to her at all. She may not be interested in him at all. It will be his loss in the end not yours. Remember any one can be a father but it takes some one special to be a daddy..., and not all men live up to the daddy bit....,may be a father but not a daddy.|`|stqRSCfwaa	well you can't just 'change' your feelings, it doesn't work like that, what i would suggest is to stay friends with her, but don't 100% depend on her as your best friend, make another friend that doesn't do what she does, this way when she is ignoring you, stay with someone else, and when not, stay with her|`|xkxpkvXZaa	If she ignored you around Christmas her family was probably forcing her to do all kinds of traditional family things.  a true friend can be a best freind and still have other people in their lives.  Just because you are best friends doesn't mean you have to b in each other's bussiness 24/7.  Everyone needs their space.  If one person dominates all of your time then they are not really a freind they have a co-dependent personality and should be avoided at all costs.  People with co-dependent personalities will only bring theself and others around them down with them.

GByLJCfuaa	in tx, it depends on who actually supported the child for the majority of the year, or sometimes it may be better off if the non custodial parent does claim the kid. sometimes depending on teh parents they can come to an agreement about it.   But for the most part its who the kid lives with that gets to claim the child.    edit: if you are ordered to pay child support, but not making payments, no, not sure if you can claim the kid, but they are going to ? y then are you ordered to pay childsupport.   ps: whether or not you claim the kid or not, if/when you file your taxes, the refund automatically goes directed to you c/s.   and you dont get much if any..|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	It depends on the agreement. In some cases it is stated that if the father is in arrears he forfeits his right to claim the dependent children for that year. (it states in my husband's papers he gets to claim his son every odd year so long as he is no more than 3 payments behind)  If there is no formal agreement, then according to the federal government, unless you had the children more than half the time, or contributed more than half the amount of money for their care, you can not claim them. If you are on good terms with the mother, you may be able to if she lets you (my sister let her ex claim the children so his arrearages would be caught up with the return. She figured it was a win win since she would get the return and she hadn't received any support from him)|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	depends on the state.  some states it's automatic, some states it has to be written in your court order that way.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Not that I'm aware of.  Usually the Court's specify who may claim a dependent(s) and it usually favors the custodial parent.  If nothing is specified in the divorce decree / chilld support agreement, its first come first serve with the IRS.  You can of course fight it by sending a copy of the child support agreement to the IRS (showing you have full custody) and then they would give you the money while sending the non-custodial parent a rather large bill.  At any rate, if a person is behind on child support then usually they won't receive a dime of a tax refund (it is automatically pulled and sent to the custodial parent).|`|ndQkhqZeaa	If a parent is non-custodial why would they claim the child?    If it is in a divorce agreement,  they should claim, it will be taken to pay the unpaid child support.  I would make sure the agreement does not state must be current in support.
cIBqQ0QEaa	Yes you should try it on and no you don't have to go back to David's Bridal to do so. Just have your mom or MOH help you put it on as they usually have to go over your head and you'll have to be zipped (or tied) up. But definitely try it on before the wedding, the last thing you want is a last minute mishap.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Try it on...|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	yes you surely do want to try it on.  you never know for sure what you may have gained/lost in the weight department...you will also want to see the dress on yourself to make sure that there arent any funny bits that need to be pressed or steamed because they got wrinkled while getting shipped.      if you already have the dress in your possession, no, you dont need to go back to davids bridal to try it on.  just enlist a couple friends to help get you safely in/out of it, and together you can figure out what, if any alterations need to be made.  from there you can  find a seamstress, or go back to davids bridal and see what they charge for alterations|`|224598c2e3c1d07cad06c082f551c456aa	you might want to try it on again, if that one was tried on a lot it might fit a little differently. and you want the perfect fit for your wedding!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	YEs Absolutely...try it on and make sure this one is perfect too.    congratulations!:)|`|FVFxE6owaa	You definitely need to try it on again, but you don't need to go back to the store to do it.  Just have your mom or a friend help you out with it.  If it fits perfectly, great!  If not, you will have time to get alterations done.  A word of advice, do not have your alterations done at David's Bridal...they charge way too much!  Find a seamstress that specializes in wedding dresses and works out of her home or in a small shop.  It will be cheaper that way.|`|JXw0U77aaa	You definitely have to try it on again before the wedding, just to make sure that everything was done properly, and also to see if you need to gain or lose weight to make up for anything you may have lost/gained since ordering it.  You don't have to go to David's to do it, but it would be good to since a consultant can help you into it, and can also point out things that may be ill-fitting or need to be altered (i.e., hem, etc).  Plus, they'll have the big mirrors that help you see things from multiple angles.|`|8NgbQNSMaa	most def. you need to try it on . but you do not need to go to David's Bridal to try it on . you have to make sure you look good for you wedding day.

When a breakup happens, you can analyze every aspect of the relationship and think about what you did wrong. Point is, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG! She just didn't feel the way that you did. The only thing that you can get from this is that you learned from the relationship.    It will take awhile for the pain to go away. Slowly is does. Just surround yourself with good friends and family for support. Feel better and good luck!|`|hCT7jlsyaa	i could say that the night is darkest before the dawn, there are plenty of fish in the sea, if its not meant to be then its not meant to be but i dont think any of the words provide comfort, at least not to me. there really isnt a "best way" to forget about a loved one who left. my ex girlfriend dumped me a while ago and im still not over that. i ALWAYS wonder what our lives would be like if we got back together, but everyday the reality to the contrary becomes ever more apparent. it tears me apart to know someone that i care about so much is happy without me. but i want her to be happy above all else. i find comfort in friends, and just trying not to think about it. time also has a way of healing the pain|`|3wwDcYBnaa	u r not broken but that is token not to repeat again|`|nuT4GDTEaa	U cant sit and cry over spilled milk.

ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	Way to go to want to spend time with your Mom.  Here are a few suggestions (depending on $)    1. A day at the spa  2. Just getting a manicure together  3. Visiting other family members (i.e. grandmother, aunt)  4. A wall through the mall  5. A mini weekend getaway.  6. A simple pizza and game of cards|`|HjPt0V8Eaa	the best way to spend time with your mom? treat her to eat at malls, watch movie together and the best is go shopping.|`|l7Q5tCpbaa	Shopping? That way you can talk about the things to see and if it goes quiet you can people watch.     Maybe do a spa day kind of thing? Then you can talk about treatments you had and the therapists, and she'll feel that she's being pampered so maybe see that you think she deserves to be spoiled.    I'm trying to think of things that don't cost money too (well, besides window shopping!) but that's really hard these days - especially when whatever you do has to have something that either eliminates need to talk or provides starters for conversation.    Could you take up a hobby together? Crafts maybe?Or take a class together? (I know you've got enough with college, but if you could learn a language together or something arty like cermics or photography? Or maybe a yoga class or something? Give you designated time to chill each week.)    You could dig out some old photos and make a family history book - get your mom to tell you about when she was little, what she remembers of her parents, when you were born.Where her first job was.  My gran did this with me and when she died I was glad she had- I was the only grandchild to know where she'd worked, what she'd liked at school, it made me feel close to her.|`|AA10602627	try outdoor activities, or something that both of you enjoy together like doing ur hobby or something. u can also team up with ur mum to organize some gathering. by working together maybe it can get both of u get close .

IKXZZDH9aa	Sec. 3.003 TX Fam. Code    PRESUMPTION OF COMMUNITY PROPERTY.    (a)  Property possessed by either spouse during or on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property.    (b)  The degree of proof necessary to establish that property is separate property is clear and convincing evidence.    So through CLEAR and CONVINCING evidence, you can show that it was separate property by using authenticated statements displaying the amount in the account PRIOR to the date of marriage.      Sec. 3.007 TX. Fam. Code    This section covers property Interest in Certain Employee Benefits.    Basically the court is to operate under the "fresh start" rule and calculate as if the contributions started when the marriage began so as long as the  benefit program was started before the marriage. Otherwise it falls under community property.    So yes, your calculation is correct in her receiving 500 dollars.|`|dtHjJah5aa	You need a good lawyer and you must show proof of what your 401K was before you got married.

Try asking her out for a drink or dinner or a concert etc and if it goes well at the end tell her how you feel instead of being dead thinking you may of had a chance. Think Positively! yes you work together but do you want to regret not asking her out? only send flowers if it went extremley well and you kissed. Hope it goes well!|`|lRklcZtBaa	you need to wait until you been goin out wit her for a while to tell her how you really a feel. it will creep her out and you  prob not going to get **** lol. k ya just take her out again and just give it time go on a bunch of dates together so she gets close wit you. and try to not be too nice be kanda dick lol good luck|`|MWsI9Uu4aa	My dad always said "Son, don't get your bread and meat at the same store."    Take his advice.|`|9ZTADEzTaa	I am in a similar situation to you. I think you should go for it. I'm going to do the same tomorrow hopefully. Good luck|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	I have some advice for you that you may not like but it's the truth..."don't dip your pen in the company ink".  (In other words, its never a good idea to date people you work with.)|`|If7d3qJIaa	ask her out for something casual like a coffee or a few drinks after work.  while on this meet up gauge her interest (ask her directly if need be)  if she likes you suggest a nice bistro/restaurant to go on to for food    but definitely ask her out - it is better to regret something you have done than to regret something you haven't|`|rBfyVHPvaa	you should ask her before somebody else does and i think you should start by sending the flowers at work so everybody can see who sent them and thats it.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Yeah why not? Go for it. Ask her out. If you don't, it will always be in the back of your mind and you'll end up regretting it if you never tried at least. What's the worst she can say? If she's not interested at least you'll know. I'm sure any girl would love to get treated the way you did, like royalty. I know I would. If she does say no, then she is missing out. You seem like a really nice guy. I'm sure you can still be friends at least. Thats how I look at it.|`|yWBmZrfAaa	I think you shoud go for it.|`|sJkwG5wfaa	Well to be honest with yiu find someone who is for you. Obviously this woman has used and will use you again as a back up plan. Working together and dating is not a good thing because think about it if you all dont work out or have a very, very bad break up it will never be over becuase when you go to work the next day you will still have to face each other.     If she cant see that you are interested in her that's because her head is up the army boy's you know what. And if you have any respect for yourself you would choose a better woman cause anyone who knows a man is married and still continues to date and see him then who's to say she her screws are nissing some bolts?     Let her love what doesnt love her and you find you someone that feels the same way you do about them.    good luck|`|YDjnlQPpaa	i would ask her online, I would be like "hey what are u doing this weekend" just ask her to like hang out, go to the mall or something dont be awkward about it.You need to sound really confident like its not a big deal. If you guys do normal things together you can act normal around each other and be comfortable asking her out at another time.    good luck. be confident :)
v1yefcFjaa	people with job experience and education are losing their jobs so no jobs are really super secure right now. if you have a lot of money saved up (approx. $20,000) to last you for a while until the economy starts picking up, you shouldn't have any problem moving out. good luck
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	I am not sure if that's a cultural thing.  See how she reacts if some girls do to you what she did to that guy.  If she is ok with that, maybe it is not a big deal.  But if she has a problem with that, then she can't avoid the conversation.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Start flirting with other girls and see what she has to say.|`|AaoLwJJWaa	from what i've learned about this world is that ANYTHING can happen, you'd be suprised about the things that could happen that you'd never know about.  I'd say you should just go on as things are, and if the slightest suspicion of something comes up, tell her it's time to break it off.      Another thing you should know about body language is that most of it is unconscious, she may be attracted to him(no matter what, we can't turn off our attraction to people once we're "taken") and doing the movements unconsciously. As long as she isn't acting on it, then just go along.|`|v2D4Sao5aa	dump her if shes going to be like tht then dump her ..bc she has to respect you like you respect her|`|L9MQgdzHaa	well you need to tell her that you have a problem with that because she would get mad if you did the same thing in her face|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	No matter what, she is wrong.|`|mINKANlAaa	im sorry! i hate to break it to you, but you have to tell her this bothers you. say you dont like it when she flirts with other guys, and if she denies being flirtatious, describe how she acts with other guys. maybe she doesnt even realize it and will be careful in the future, but if she doesnt change, she is not worth your time. im sorry, but if a girl continues acting like that with other guys and she clearly has a bf (you), theres a problem with it. she could even be cheating on you behind your back. just be careful and keep an eye on her, dont need anything surprising to happen.|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	well i think she does this to get you yellest..and it is working ...she loves you..and she probably wants you to want her more..thats why she flirts with guys maybe and she just needs you more then you need her..seriously..you need to be enjoying alllooot of time together with her ..to win her back" i guess..  hopefully i helped..|`|4LYasBGXaa	it IS disrespectful.    it doesn't mean she is cheating- but it is VERY disrespectfull given the degree of her actions and the key point of which was ALIENATING you.    its one thing to make a flirtatious joke or action that might be seen as flirtatious, its another to do it infront of you and completely disregard your presence.    I would talk to her and explain to her how it made you feel- if she is dismissive of your feelings and doesn't provide any REAL reassurances to you then you need to really re-consider this relationship becasue that is a sign of disaster (her not respecting your feelings and dismissing them).    as far as the language goes- i'll say the same thing to you as i would say to someone here in the U.S.- but the opposite.    you can't expect someone to cater to your language needs when you are in THIER country. in spain you speak spanish.    in america you speak english. in england you speak some semblance of english.|`|uAt5NIk6aa	I know if you talk to her she'll say your insecure, but i really think you should.    Maybe you can get one of your friends that she doesn't know, or have ever heard about. to try and hit on her while shes out somewhere without you there.    but if she really loved you, then i don't think she would try anything.  just be cautions about the situation.     i hope this helps!|`|NEfezEUQaa	Maybe she's trying to make you jealous so you'll pay more attention to her.  However, it's more likely that she was flirting because she's not serious enough about you and is willing to cheat.  I'm sorry, I hope it's the first reason.      You can't prevent this from happening.  Yes' her friends would likely cover for her, but this questioning is somewhat stalker-esque|`|Ne7X11O8aa	I find it to be very disrespectful of her to do that to you and we all know she's doing it intentionally.  She knows what she's doing.  She's a grown woman.  If you've already tried talking to her and she gets angry and doesn't want to talk about it, then obviously she is hiding something.  If she can do this to you in front of your face, I don't see why she wouldn't do it behind your back.     I think the question you should ask is, "Do I really want to be with someone who doesn't share my love or respect me?"  Is she worth going through all this trouble just to try and "win" her back?  She's your girlfriend.  You don't need to "win" her back.  If you want, you can make a Pros and Cons list and see which one outweigh the other.  If the pros outweigh the con then I guess you can try and fight for your relationship.  If it's the other way around, I say forget her and move on.|`|KSAbA57Haa	Honestly can not say what I would do. From a strictly objective point of view I say this, politely excuse yourself and leave. If and when she comes back to you discuss your problem with her. And you know that at this time you have her undivided attention.

y43tzOQlaa	If you two really want to give these two boys a better life and a real chance you will go through the motions. Yes, once the system that is meant to protect them gets involved it sucks! I have been a step mom for 13 yrs. and had to go through all that crap with their mom. They were only 4&5 and it was a long hard road, both financially and mentally. But if you two are committed stick to it , it's hard, no doubt but it can be so worth it. I now have two lovely daughters 17 & 18 who have always known me as the mom who has supported them and loved them, their mom is in another state and they don't see her but once or twice a year.  I just consider her the egg donor, I did all the work as a mom, so hang in there and do what's right for those two little boys who need love and support. Good luck|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	Why would you care if they made you take alcohol tests if you don't drink?  I don't get that.  Since you had your boyfriend call them, where did you think they would be placed?  He is their father.  I don't understand why you can't take care of the boys much better than his ex.  Do you do drugs too?  DCF tries to keep children with their families if possible.  It sounds like they are trying to get the children's parents to grow up and get their priorities straight so these children can have a change at a decent chance at ife with responsible adults taking care of them.

In my state legal consent is 16. I do want to mention though at 17 your not fully mature yet. You may not know what you want. So if your the 17 year old make sure its what you want. When i was 17 i was with an older man i really regret it cuz i got used and then everyone knew about it. :( If your the 30 year old please make sure they are ready for this. If they are to immature then your only gonna get hurt. In any relationship you need to make sure that both parties are in it whole heartily but when there is such and age cap you need to take into consideration the  maturity level and what each person's goals are in life. the younger party may not want to settle down as soon as the older party.    Im trying to keep personal opinions out here and stay objective so I hope i haven't offended anyone. Hope this helps. Good Luck
HlaEUb3Uaa	Oh boy, well have you ever thought about a woman with children already?  Your 41 in my opinion you too old to be having babies anyways.  Not because your going to die, but imagine the age gap there.  Will you relate?  will you be around when they graduate, what about grandchildren?  I know everyone should be allowed to procreate, but if you missed your chance how fair is it to bring a child in at your age.  May not seem like a big deal to you or your wife, but I know too many kids raised by older parents, and grandparents, who end up pretty interesting, and not necessarily interesting in the good way.  Most woman at that age have kids already...I do not see a problem with you being single especially if you have what you say.  As for your wife.  It's very sad, but she's clearly not a very nice person.  if she's willing to even say that she should look elsewhere means she should.  If she can't get over this and find an alternative and leave you alone about it, she needs to leave and find someone else that she can have babies with.  Your probably lucky, do you really want to live with someone forever that makes you feel this crappy over something you can't control?  I'd say tell her to drop it and look into adoption, it's not going to be your baby anyways with a sperm donor.  The amount of time and money you are going to invest into making a baby that (I'm not religous) seems like it shouldn't be there should also be considered on YOUR end.  Do what makes you happy, you are the most important person in your life.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Oh hey  Look at the brite side. There are many many women out there in your age bracket that already have kids so it shouldn't be a problem.    But if you were smart you would find a woman who doesn't want or can't have kids and have a great life together. You could travel and do whatever you wanted without concern about who's going to take care of junior.|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	Someone should love you for you.  It doesn't matter that you can't have children yourself.  Yes, there's infertilation, but also adoption.  I can't have anymore children due to medical issues, but my husband is there no matter what.  I'm lucky to have 1 child, being told I couldn't have any.  My husband still married me knowing that there was a chance that I couldn't have any.      Yes, there's still hope of happiness for you to marry in a healty, happy relationship.
JJ70xdpKaa	Lol.wow you totally blew things out of proportion.How could you say that to her?all she did was give her opinion about your pic.and to be honest it isnt even that offensive.In a way it does look scary but not really.But either way you should never embarrass  anyone in that matter especially in front of your friends dude.shes your girlfriend wheres your respect?lol.  geez..and your hott too lmao.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Yeah, that was a very mean and disrespectful. I understand you were mad, but this is a type of abuse.    I think she would feel better if you were to apologize to her, but it would be better in front of your friends to do so, so it doesn't seem like you were just trying to show off. Catch my drift. Also, your friends would be there to witness it and not laugh at her feelings.     Good Luck|`|1nC4fVw3aa	DUDE GO GET A FUC**** LIFE. PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IDIOT. HES MAKING ALL THIS UP.

To me, it doesn't sound like this is the first time something like this happened....|`|aJKpiFBlaa	LoL, you called her worthless, useless, stupid, and ignorance when all she did was comment your picture? dude you said it 10x worst and to her face versus her comment to a picture. GL pal. appology with roses or w. something she likes.|`|0e28377041dba0c462a292077a7ea885aa	Ok, she called your picture scary. And didnt put it on Facebook. Big whoop. You basically said she didnt deserve to exist.   If she's your girlfriend, she cares about your opinion more than anyone else would. The reason she cried probably isnt what you said, but the fact that it was you who said it.   If anyone else had said those things to her, I'm fairly certain you'd have punched them in the teeth. She's your girlfriend. You're supposed to look after her, not insult her.   Never insult a woman you're supposed to love. Ever. Especially not in front of people. Would you have done it if there were a group of her friends around instead of yours? I doubt it.  If I was you I'd be cooking up a big fat apology cake and hoping that she doesnt dump you. Really, pull out the big guns on this one if you want to keep her, bro.  And the picture is a little scary. But its just a picture. Take a nice one for her and dont freak the bean over a photograph. She probably doesnt love you for your looks anyway.    Hope this helps|`|294kSBhyaa	ok so you called her useless and put her down, and yet you claim that you're a good person. hmmm... you sound like a delusional jackass (and by the way, i'm not a loser with time on my hands; i'm a great person who's taking a break from work). you sound like an insecure asshole, who can't take a little criticism. grow up! looks like you're the one who really doesn't contribute anything to the world. by the way, that pic does nothing for you; your  gf (who should break up with your ***, let alone refuse to fornicate with you), was right.|`|db499aaf30c6e4889f0ae5e929503e4eaa	Yea it kinda look scary to me 2  But that was wrong to make her cry in front your friends nd called her ignorant.

yakmXr5Jaa	You are going to change a lot in the next 8 years or so.  And so is he.  If you get married this young, you will be married to a stranger in a few years.    I know the person you are today loves the person he is today, but when you know everything is going to change drastically for both of you, it's impossible to say this is a good decision.    When you were 11, do you remember what you wanted to be when you grew up?  You can look back now and see how much you've grown since then and how much wiser you are now.    5 years from now you'll be thinking the same thing when you look back at this decision.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Why don't you wait?

It is not right to do so at age 16 and 17.    I know at 16 you probably think that anyone over 30 is hopelessly out of touch.  I certainly thought so at 16.  What I've come to realize as I've matured is that at 16 I didn't know half as much as I thought I did.      Those of us who are past 30 really do remember what it was like to be 16.  With the wisdom that comes with time, we know that the love of a 16 year is very real.  However, it is not necessarily permanent.    Give both of you some time to mature into the adults you will become.  If you feel the same way in 3 years (5 is better) , THEN start thinking about getting married.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its not ok to marry someone just because you love them, you need to be "in love" with them and thats the key to a successful relationship.  No matter what you feel at 16 this is not being "in love" its just loving someone and thats not enough.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I think it'll be ok in a few years ?|`|29I8PWrxaa	Anyone who needs parent's permission to get married or who doesn't know "if it's right" should not get married.  Beyond that, anyone who is 16 or 17 should not get married.  I hope your parents don't consent.|`|AA10690306	Marriage is a Wonderful institution!     I just hate to see anyone institutionalized.    I was married first time at 19, I was WAY too young.|`|944df9f215372eb64e0c23c762a26e9eaa	Your brain has not fully physically developed yet. (Look it up).    You will be a different person in a few years (literally). You don't want to make permanent decision yet.|`|gt5Zdy1uaa	there is nothing wrong with being in love and getting married, but its better to wait until you are legally abled to at the age of 18. Also, you shouldn't get married until you are able to financially be able to provide for yourselves and after you finish high school. I wish the best to you and hope you follow my advice.|`|QNSnnyLiaa	Don't you want to toast at your wedding, go on a honeymoon, wake up each morning and go "off to work" not "off to school?"  Save up money and wait.  If he's the one, he will be here when you are ready.|`|7CouboDraa	First off, you cannot legally get married at your age. You have to be older, or to get married at your age, your parents and his parents have to give consent. Secondly the fact that you have to ask "is it right", shows you aren't ready to be married anyhow.    At your age, even if you love him, no it is not right. Neither of you have fully developed in your personalities, maturity, etc etc. For christ sake you're both two kids still, you aren't even out of basic school yet. You both will continue to change for a few more years before you know who you are and before your minds are completely developed. The odds of two highschoolers staying married for years and years is very slim. I don't think you want to be married before you even have the chance to get out and live for a while, which would probably cause you two to end up in divorce.    You don't want to make a decision you'll end up regretting in a couple years. If you truly love him, and if he truly loves you, then you can WAIT for marriage. If you can't wait for marriage and just date each other, then you will never make it through marriage.    I know MTV has a show about younger people getting married at 18,19, etc and they make it look like it is all a happy, fun, easy little walk in the park, but it is not. Being married takes a lot of work, effort and maturity.    Just be a kid while you still are one. Stop trying to grow up so fast.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	OK. 16 is too young to get married. Back in my day 16 was too young to get married - so don't think this is a new idea.    If you and your boyfriend really do love each other you will sit down and make some life decisions. Where will you live? How will you support each other? What about children? and a whole lot of other things that you're probably putting off because "love will keep you together."    How about agreeing to be a couple for the next 6 years. That will get you through high school and college (and some good careers only take 2 years to get) and into good careers. THEN start thinking about getting married. Not before.    OK so what you really need to be reminded of is to practice safe sex. Just remember - safe sex.|`|Xw9LqSUNaa	If i was you I would wait til I was out of school.|`|NGk5IrWWaa	you're too young. im 15, and im telling you, you are too young.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	I think because you're questioning it, you already know your answer.    Answer this question: are you going to spend the rest of your life with him?    If your answer is yes, why can't you wait until you finish college? See where life takes you! Grow together and see where your relationships leads you both.     If your answer is no, then marriage shouldn't be even considered.|`|E9MF18FRaa	you should wait till you are at least 18 or 19|`|ZPR9N8o3aa	Id wait a while until you have enough money and graduate from high school, whether you are going to college or not.|`|u94qpbmyaa	I know you will HATE my answer, but just try to see my view. So many of us have been in love at 17 and then we look back on our life after 2, 5, 10 years and we see we weren't really in love. I can't say you are or aren't in love and it's not my place to, but what I can say is that you have so much of your life to figure out if you are in love and if he is the right person for you. One thing I can say is don't rush it, take your time, and enjoy life. My question would be why do you feel the need to marry your bf at 17, such a fun and tender age?  Do you feel that it will eliminate you from doing other things in life? I can tell you if you have to ask a question then you probably already know the answer. It's wrong to get married and not consult your mother if you know she will be upset. :) God bless in your decision.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	No, because at 17 and 16 you won't be able to make enough money to pay rent, let alone the hundreds of other things you have to pay for to get married.    And at 16 every girl thinks she's "in love forever" with The One, The Soulmate. In three years you'll be slamming your head against a brick wall at how naive you were and what a disaster it would have been. Trust me. Every girl that has ever lived has gone through this.|`|2C9Mjrxxaa	fazizzle is right! if you are qustioning it....you already know the answer.  WAIT WAIT WAIT!|`|bXX9HjS4aa	Well here is my story, I met my now fiance 4.5 years ago when I was a freshman in high school, I was 14 he was 16, we are now 19 and 20 and plan on getting married in about 3 years when we graduate college. Now in the past 4.5 years we have been through very highs and VERY lows. At 16 we were so young and everything was right, we were in love and didn't have any care in the world, and then life hits you and it hits you fast. I suggest going a few years, through the highs and lows, and if you stay together then I would say that you have a good chance of making it to and through marriage. Wait at least 2 years.|`|lpeHQj3aaa	Naturally. But you're young yet. Why don't you wait? If you are truly for each other then you'll end up w/ each other.|`|q8eue7CRaa	You can have a long engagement and then get married in the future if things still are going good. You've got a lot of life changes ahead of you - you'll grow/evolve a lot from 18-23. You can stay together and see how you both do during your early adulthood, and then evaluate from there.
KPXwwwMMaa	Sex is a big deal because it's got a lot of adult responsibilities attached to it: marriage, pregnancy, disease, deep (and often deeply painful) emotions. Are you ready to deal with all of that yet? No. You're only 14.    I know what all those hormones raging through your body feels like. I've been through it all before, too. Everyone feels like they NEED it, but you will remain perfectly healthy without it for a while. There are many people who go their entire lives without sex, and they live happy, healthy lives.    My advice: Find another outlet for your sexual 'urges' besides knocking up your cousin. (People WILL judge you for that... even if you are not blood related) Try to keep yourself occupied for a six more years or so before you're ready for sex, children and marriage.     But if you don't take my advice, please, at least use a condom... the last thing we need is more 14 year olds making babies.|`|VMAhim63aa	your cousin would probly slap you and you deserve it.. its called porn..|`|yazZH4khaa	If you are not blood related and she wants to, then take it from there. Don't rape her for crying out loud. There are many women out there, so start looking. You have 2 healthy hands eh?! ahaha...|`|Ka1pGYzCaa	Well.. I guess if you play the banjo I say go for it and make her squeal like a pig... LOL j/k j/k... seriously dude.. go pay for a hooker or something.|`|mkorCMx1aa	first of all how old are you? you really need to be prepared and protect yourself no matter who you jump in bed with. but there has to be someone other than your cousin out there. think about how your family will reavt if you attempt this. cant you masterbate until another canidate comes along.|`|AzdAvDW1aa	Dude don't **** her that's wrong. Plus if u try to then yr friendship won't be the same again. U just need to get out their and find a gf and when the time comes **** yr gf.

If so, talk with her about taking things to a different level. If not, let it be. Don't force anything. Good luck!|`|AA11458697	first of all, HOW OLD ARE YOU?  im gonna have to guess an adolescent,(with raging hormones),  right?     you need to control yourself. try porn whenever you're in the "mood." and are you aware that there are many consequences of having sex? i mean, not all the time, but it IS risky. (infections, stds, ect.) as for your cousin, you have to think wisely. what if you get her pregnant? and your family finds out that YOU are the father of the baby?     im 90% sure youre still a kid. seriously, just wait it out. youll have it one day. just not now.
8mTSYmvhaa	surround yourself with a lot of people and make her feel unaccepted.  if she approaches you and her friend just talk amongst yourselves about something that she would have absolutely no idea about.  i did that with an annoying girl in high school and it worked. she stopped approaching us because it was awkward.  its cruel. but some annoying people just deserve to be left out cause they are so obnoxious!|`|ii0C0tfXaa	lmao. tell the girl she is annoying, its important that she hear it at a young age so she doesnt stay that way forever. also tell her what is annoying. honesty is best.|`|VZPiLBVgaa	Tell Her To Leave You Alone.     And never show her face to u again.    by the way 2 wrongs make a right if you get what i mean

AA10065812	Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.  I live in Kansas City.     Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I think it is horribly selfish to take this child away from his/her family. That's a difficult age for a child to move and since it's due to the mom just wanting a different man, don't expect the child to embrace the new man with open  arms. It's highly unlikely to happen. Can't the wife be mature and wait till this child is 18? If it's a true, real love, it will wait.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Well first, the child is old enough to tell the judge where he wants to live. The judge will seriously take into consideration the childs wishes. However most judges almost always keep kids with their mothers unless they've been deemed unfit...I don't understand it, its just a way of life it seems.  However the judge could also go for the 1/2 year split...it al depends on what the son wants, and the specifics of the situation.  You should request full custody, saying that moving away from his high school, life, friends would cause more problems, then see what your son says and the judge will go from there.|`|Oo9CG8xMaa	Ask the child...  Let him stay here for school and visit mom during the summer and school vacations...|`|yd2SP7d6aa	In this instance the Judge would likely favor the father and tell the wife that if she wants to move to CO she will do so with-out their son (she can of course have visitation during the summer months).  This is espceially true if the 14 year old son wants to stay in MO because of school, friends, family etc.    The Courts are going to balk at her expecting their son to flip flop between schools every 6 months to make her happy.  A good lawyer should put an end to her "dreams" of this happening.|`|sBDVShz7aa	I think it is horribly selfish to take this child away from his/her family.

AA11138696	First slow down and do not be so eager.  Second stop trying to make her do anything  no one likes that.  Now learn something about a woman's body and then talk to her about what happened and what was wrong.    IF she was a virgin and you went blundering about like a battering ram you most likely hurt her and she is now afraid.  You are just gonna have to learn to put your "feelings" aside long enough to regain your wife's trust that you will not hurt her again.  Take your time and be patient.  It is a lesson you could well use to learn, it will serve you well in life.|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I assume you have already apologized many times? Okay, then now you need to romance her again.  Ask her to -please- allow you to start over.  You'll have to be very patient and considerate. Buy her flowers and little gifts. Take her out to dinner, be romantic and attentive without expecting to get anything sexual in return. Start by just pampering her, kiss and hug her and be very tender. Depending on how badly you scared her the first time...it might take her a while to get over the traumatic experience.|`|hgmexwtEaa	the question is, what did you do to her??  It might take a while, but she'll eventually want to do SOMETHING again. everyone has hormones that makes them go crazy.|`|3vbHZBioaa	Explain to her what you just asked that you were so excited and started off in a hurry..make her feel wanted in the bedroom, make her feel important show her and tell her how much you love her in every way you can possible think of...good luck|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Go slow.Dont rush.Start off with kissing and caressing.Even some foreplay so that she knows that you are going to take your time and that she will get satisfaction out of the whole experience as well.|`|ceJ3O14Yaa	Start with fore play then when she asks for it the you can really make the sparks fly..  Make sure that you are ready to go for a while with out your pleasure to make sure she gets hers.  If you have to take care of yourself about 1 hr before you start to play with her this way you wont get to excited and be unable to control your self and go to soon,  make sure she gets hers.....|`|dtHjJah5aa	If she was a virgin I can understand why she would be afraid of making love with you!  Slow down!  I'm sure you hurt her on your wedding night. If you want her to respond to you then you will have to show her some affection.  Kiss her, carress her, for as long as it takes, make her feel comfortable with you and give HER pleasure.  If she still doesn't want to make love to you then just hold her in your arms and show her you love her and care about her feelings.  Control yourself.  Don't make it all about you.  That's the best advice I can give any man.  Good luck.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Will she drink alcohol.  Give her a couple drinks?  Give her oral sex or if she won't let you do that, touch her with your hands a LONG time before you have intercourse again.|`|AA10248966	Softly tell her that if this is how it will be you will get an annulment immediately, that she must grow up and be a mature woman. If she cannot get out ASAP! For real.|`|j7l9gavRaa	she doesn't want to do it ever again?  you must have really messed up that first time lol  talk to her about it|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Seduce her slowly (carefully), sweetly and romantically. If you scared her the first time you should not approach her like a panting dog. Wine and dine her first, hold hand, kiss a lot (gently) and work it from there.    Good luck
bO2rzfISaa	Well, it's hard to argue with her logic. She DOES need to do what's best for the boys. But there has to be a balance between that and what you're willing to accept, because she ISN"T single, and some of the things she does affect you a lot. My boundaries would be no on the rehab classes and drying out in my house. I would always give him money to come see the boys; that has a direct effect on the children. He's good to them; that's really important. His NA sponsor could take on some of these roles, or find someone who could. He needs to cultivate some resources who will do these things for him; I think she is enabling him, as she probably did during their marriage (enabling him to use without serious consequence).    She could benefit from some meetings at Alanon. If she understood that her behavior isn't benefitting him, is in fact hurting him, she might stop.|`|AA11990465	It sounds like her ex is still a very big part of her life, but that doesn't mean that you need to feel threatened by him. It is possible for a couple to split up and still remain very good friends. As long as her ex isn't trying to break the two of you up or get your wife back I don't think I would worry too much about it.|`|j7l9gavRaa	that's up to you but she is obviously good friends with him and feels the need to keep him around for her children|`|8txWayVnaa	WOW!  That is TOUGH, and you are a saint.  I have two boys myself (7 and 11), so this kind of resonates with me.    I think your wife's heart is in the right place, but I'm not so sure about the rest of it.  Being supportive is one thing, but she's married to YOU now.  His family needs to step in and do the things that she is doing.    ADDITIONAL THOUGHT:    Tell your wife that you knew she came as a "package deal" (she and her boys), but that did NOT include her ex-husband!    Where do you draw the line? I give you props for letting your wife's ex-husband stay at your house!  I would have drawn the line well before that.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I admire your wifes efforts to make it as easy as possible for him to have a relationship with his kids, I am positive she is doing this for the childrens sake, not his, and I am sure that the kids benefit from this, but he also does too, and this is were I do not see this as fair to you.    I would want my spouse to honor my mixed feelings, but on a completly differnet note, he isnt attempting at all on his own, you cant force someone to be a parent, they either are, or they arent, its that simple....suggest maybe that she cut him off for a bit, see if he makes any attempt or effort to get better, the longer she strings him along, the longer its going to take for him to grow up and smell the roses, I can assume she was in a mothering roll in their relationship as well? Maybe its hard for her to let go, sometimes we get so acustomed to caring for others, we forget that we dont have to!    I would draw the line at having him at your house, unless its a snowy night and theres no way of him getting home, or hes seriously injured himself and needs a nights stay, I would say no, you do not support his lifestyle choices and you do not want him in your home, you honor the reasons your wife is beign so nice, and you admire them all, but bottom line , this situation is begining to affect you and your relationship. She might get angry with you, but I think you will feel better getting it out there to her, you sound like a great guy, the children clearly wont be lacking a positive father figure in thier lives, its time she cut this guy off the long chord he has her own|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I don't think you should worry about anything romantic happening between them. I think she's just being a good friend and trying to give her kids the chance to have a good father. You sound like an incredible man and your wife must be the best friend anyone could wish to have. I don't know you, but you two seem like two great people who have very kind hearts. Maybe you could talk to her and tell her you don't oppose her giving the ex-husband some support, but that it makes you uncomfortable having him stay at your home. Meet in the middle; compromise. Both of you have to give and sacrifice equally for the sake of your relationship.|`|FzFSzilmaa	her boys, her life, her ex - HER CHOICE!!!    if you can't take it and support her, then perhaps you should see about ending the relationship...|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	You have to remeber he will always be in her life for the kids and it is better if all parties get along.

She needs to put her current relaitonhip before hers and teh ex, alhtough the children do always come first.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	The gas I could deal with, the rehab class I would definately be uncomfortable with (spending time / bonding with her ex-husband), but I would NOT allow the ex to live (dry out) in my house.  If she disregarded me on the house issue, divorce paper work would follow shortly.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	Draw the line a long time ago. Like hell he would stay in my house. My kids dad or not. Maybe he keeps pulling bs to see what all she will do for him? I would put a stop to it. It can't be good for the children to see him all druged up.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Having a christian and charitable heart toward him is an honorable thing.  But the best thing for those boys is to keep them as far as possible from an addict.  Having him around endangers them physically, emotionally, financially.  Perhaps he would feel a motivation to overcome if he knew his habit was costing him his relationship with his sons.  On top of that, in many states, if you willingly brought addicts into your home to "dry out", and you had kids, teachers or medical personnel would be required to report you to family services for endangering your children.    So it sounds like you have to get some back bone here.  Talk to a councilor, even if you want to tell a "story" about a "friend of yours in this situation" just to be safe - and see what actions they recommend.  You can even call family services and ask for their advice about this "friend" of yours.  Then present your wife with the advice from the agency.|`|AA11724710	It's obvious that she has love for him, and she wants him to be a good father to her children, but at the same time she can't go around being super woman and teaching him how to be grown he has to do that on his own, it's good to support someone but to a certain point I think you should tell her to calm down just a little, that u understand where's she's coming from but tell her how u feel about it, and compromise this whole siuation if not things might get a little out of hand. You have to communicate so there won't be nobody wondering about anything|`|g37eLIxgaa	It is good for the kids to keep their father in their life, but what kind of influence is a father on drugs?  He definitely needs support if he is actually trying to get cleaned up, but is he really actually trying?      I think you need to sit down with your wife and try to lay out some guidelines that both of you agree on.  He should not be financually supported by you or your wife,  If he needs to see his kids and really wants to see them then he should take the necessary actions to make sure it can happen.      *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|YUtUsxLbaa	Where you draw the line is up to you.  What can you live with?  Sounds like you should talk with your wife.  Try to be open, honest, and do not attack.  You've already made a choice to be with her and this is part of her life - and, therefore, yours.  Talk things out and come to something you both (or hopefully, all) can live and deal with.
0gOWh0z2aa	Please don't do this.  My wife and I have one rule...no one else comes into our bedroom, through pictures, video, fantasy or physically.

Dump him and ring me up.|`|FzFSzilmaa	if that is what he wants, and you appear to be almost like his personal slave, you might as well go the whole hog...    3sums are fun... ;) or you could try exhibitionism...|`|89TgOjXpaa	i think he is taking you for granted, obviously he is not happy with just you, i would stop spoiling him so much and make him do these things for himself you are not there for his beck and call... tell him straight that you will not be having any scrag in the bedroom for a 3some and if he don't like it tuff or tell him to leave,
8HgvkFowaa	Take her out to a nice restaurant and pay for her. Or maybe a spa for a day certificate.

07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Not a guy, but had experience in this same situation... People will do what they can to sabotage a budding friendship when they feel threatened...  The KEY to this whole thing is YOU!  Said Guy may only want one thing.  You won't know this until you go out with him a few times & get to know him. You do not have to give him anything you are not comfortable with. And you get to say whether or not his friends were right or wrong. It all is YOUR decision!  (isn't that neat?)     Treat yourself with Respect & others will respect you in return. Never give the most precious gift, (which is your body) to someone who will abuse it. When you give in too quick, you can watch a guy run fast to the next girl... Take your time. If all he wanted was a piece of hinny, you will soon know that & can call it off before giving in, saving yourself a ton of heart ache!|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Don't listen to his friends - they're probably just jealous and trying to start drama. Trust your instincts and see what happens. If he tries pulling moves on you all the time, let him know you're not ready for that. If he really does like you, he'll respect that.|`|j7l9gavRaa	go out with him and don't give it up if he sticks around then they were lying|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Easy, don`t give him what he wants. Try to be a friend, don`t jump steps and he`ll be at your feet, for the time that you want. Otherwise his friends mite be right.  (Sure, mostly guys you said, and here we are, ladies..giving advise)|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Well I would be cautious but still go out with him.  I'm sure you'll be able to tell what his intentions are when you're together.  If you really trust these guys, then I might listen to them.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	why are you asking inmarriage in divorce take this question to singles and dating!|`|prMKOPKJaa	there is only one way to find out. go out with him and if he is all over you then you will know. dont give in to him because then they all will be trying for the same thing. respect yourself and they will respect you too.  good luck|`|3PFJGzzsaa	sorry but i am a girl. but.... i have a best friend that this happened 2.... just date the guy. his friends are just jealous..|`|m99zvUEyaa	Give him a chance and date him.  You'll know soon enough what he's about. Sounds like you have thought this through and found someone special, long term. Don't start out too hot as males are very visually stimulated and prone to mis-interpreting  you by how you dress.  First impressions are important. How you come across will impact on his future expectations of the relationship. As for testosterone chatter, your obvious class in the relationship will make that evaporate soon enough.|`|9W2dkfffaa	What one person does to another dosen't mean they will do that to you.  Even if the guy was a player dosen't mean he can't fall in love with the right girl.  Make the decision for yourself but take what they say into consideration to proceed cautiously so you don't get hurt.  I would take it slow but don't be insecure or you will sabotage it before it has a chance.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Sweetie, I know Im not a guy but there aint many on here today! lol  So anyhow, who cares if that is his goal.  You can say no.  You will know then you can say Hit the road jack! I dont know how old you are, but its cool to date around. You dont have to settle with just one guy until you are absolutely sure and totally crazy in love with him. You wont have doubts you will know.  So go for it.  dont worry what the guys say.  Make it clear that you arent that kind of girl.    Guys do like a challenge and they like to be the first.  So guys will try this though. Keep that in your head.  And remember they know all the right things to say to get you there too! lol  Bu tyou are a smart girl and it wont work on you.  Go to you tube and search for SEX lyrics and song and watch the video and listen to the words...awesome song.   good luck and enjoy the dating years...there are ups and downs but its the bomb!
58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	You should both know that the first time is not fun at all. It hurts for her and is messy for you. She will bleed a lot. Basically, you should  make sure to use plenty of lube and take it slow. Push slowly until it works. If not, use your fingers to try to losen her up a little. It will take some time. Foreplay will help her to relax and be more "open" jeff-get a life and piss up a rope|`|TstiC2Ilaa	Lube or just shove it in. Trust me, I was the same way, and he just have to shove it in, it hurt at first, buuuut it got better. :]|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	try putting it in a different hole.

Mr6U1TiHaa	well thats what yahoo answers is for...and even better.. because you write your problem and people try to help you,youll find answers from many different point of views, and you go with the one you like the most, plus no body gets to see who you are or anything...now tell us hunyy, how can we help you?|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	talk to me|`|mBXu5G5saa	Well that is really sad and i do not know of any but yahoo answers can always help some.

x4xaqrpCaa	Its always hard to break up with a boyfriend or someone you gotten really close too. Especially since it was after 2 years. But, love, sometimes, you have to try and move on. Its okay to mourn and cry a little bit. But if your going crazy..you make it sound as if your obessed you know..not to be rude..try and do something else to get him off your mind sweetheart...the rest if up to you to decided hunnie|`|04F4149yaa	You just wasted two years on an ignorant break up.

cIBqQ0QEaa	Just ask your parents if your new gf can come over for dinner some time with all of you. I am sure they won't mind and I don't see any need to mention that she is black. There is nothing wrong with dating someone of a different race so don't think of her as your black gf, she's just your gf. If they don't like it at first, eventually your parents will get used to it, so you may as well acquaint them now. Best of luck and don't worry!|`|X4hz3a9haa	I think it your life and you should date who you feel happier with, whatever the skin colour, we all bleed the same colour, explain your feelings to your mum and dad, and also explain that whatever they feel, you will continue to date this girl, and you hope that they will accept her for who she is as a person and not judge her on the colour of her skin. Good Luck.|`|O1FPCEHvaa	I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.    Like what was mentioned before, your parents probably only laughed because they thought it was a joke.    Your parents should not mind if you tell them about your girlfriend, you are their child, whoever you love, they won't mind.     Remember, your parents are always there for you, don't be afraid to tell them anything.    Good luck with your relationship, I hope everything will turn out good :)|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i wish you both ..all the best .mate lets hope it works out ..|`|mGvSEY6Saa	your just going to have to sit down and tell you parents that you really like this girl, and they should accept that, her colour of skin should not matter at all because it is about the kind of person she is deep down. the outside does not matter, tell your parents this, tell them you like her, and ask them to accept that fact :)  good luck!|`|l1KlZrAOaa	If I was your parent I think I would be more concerned about your age rather than your choice in color.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	If your parents haven't expressed anything that would make you suspect them of having anything against someone merely because of the colour of their skin, I would say you have nothing to worry about.|`|3PFJGzzsaa	you cannot choose who you fall in love with. tell ur mum that if she loves you then she will love all whom  you love! worked 4 me.|`|QIwhMrBraa	i can tell u right now they may hit the roof when u tell them. they mite have laughed before cos they thought u were joking. but u arent. now it may not be so funny.    u are asking for a lot of problems taking this course. family who dont like a partner - and this dont have to be for any fair reason - will cause all sorts of problems, plus you still got a society who dont like mixed couples and ul have to deal with the disapproving glances when you two are together in public.    think about it.|`|1SZCgbNsaa	hmmmm just talk to your parents that you are seriously dating a black girl. if you say they are not racist then...nothing to worry about it. and besides....whats wrong with dating a black girl? or asian? or whatever...dont worry. just be honest of what you feel.|`|pTSk4O8Aaa	tell your parents your seeing this girl!!!!    http://www.sexyemilie.com/?id=1278065|`|JaNE0HKyaa	Just tell them you all need to sit down and talk. Tell them it's no joke you love her and you want them to be ok with it.|`|0213803fc19fd10c5a6f0ddb8efc455eaa	Be honest with them it better they know before she comes around and feel uncomfortable if they are not happy.  Then take it from there. Hope they are happy for you.|`|ZJohgu1saa	Hey dont worry, u cant help who ur attracted too, and if ur nan approves, maybe ur parents will too. But remember if u really like the the girl then just say it when u feel most comfortable in telling them.    I hope it works out for u.    :-)))|`|UNryBT1naa	She should love whomever you do, and she should be happy for you and your girl. good luck, :)
aGXankr2aa	You only agreed to catch up with her, this implies you were  friends in the past.  Agree to meet up, and why not take your girlfriend with you, that should make it clear.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	Um...I'm not sure you could tell her without making her think you are a jerk...    You could just tell her the truth "I'm really sorry, but I was drunk one night and flirting with you. I'm sorry if I led you on, but I have a girlfriend and we can be nothing more than friends."    Or if you aren't brave enough for that say "I would hang out with you, but my girlfriend probably wouldn't like that", or that you won't be able to hang out ___ day because you are hanging out with the girlfriend.    Orr, you could keep assuring her that you are only interresting in being FRIENDS.|`|84Dauu2xaa	Txt that you won't be able to make it, in a friendly polite way though.  In conversation, maybe when your in class/at school, mention your girlfriend eg. I saw a good movie with my girlfriend on the weekend.  Whether she was intentionally flirting or not, that will let her know that you just want to be friends : )|`|Wch2WybQaa	Just apologize and tell her that you let things go too far, and that you are already seeing someone.|`|UX3xmWc6aa	just say lik Your so Excited to see your girlfriend this weekend.. thats telling her without being too mean|`|T3neqEXqaa	well for one. You guys sounded like you were wasted.  So i would let her know what was going on.  And just let her know. (be blunt)  And if she doesn't get the hint be mean.  and try to find her someone else.|`|yPU75DdIaa	u cant al i can say is suck it up and crush her heart  good luck man
VtTU4KcNaa	Men masturbate whether they are in a relationship or not.  Part of the reason is that our bodies are constantly producing sperm and if we don't we get blue balls.  Another reason is hormones.    As for the porn, men are visual creatures.  Our fantasies are different from women's fantasies.    You need to get over your insecurity that you are being replaced by porn stars and a box of tissues.|`|lGS1zOd6aa	because his hand dosent mind if he turns over and sleeps|`|nMzzwrtUaa	It's just masturbation even married men masturbate and look at porn just to fill our curious void. Men can play any role in there mind, don't be upset about it nor be angry at him for it he enjoys sex and he isn't cheating there can be worse things that could happen.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Get you a man that will put all that energy toward you.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Exactly what joe cool said.       I am married and i masturbate my wife does know about it   but dont have a problem with it but it horomones and just part  of being a guy.|`|gYyW39wTaa	its normal.He is a guy|`|807fcae559f0d52cb9c4a617e1ab098aaa	HE DOES IT BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD. DONT MAKE A LOT OUT OF IT.|`|c7667735aa54c174cb90c83107258ae4aa	Why do feel that you need to make him stop doing something he likes?  Does the fact that he is independent of you bother you THAT much?  It really pisses you off that there's something he doesn't need you for?    It has nothing to do with you.  I know, I know, it's difficult for you to wrap your little tiny brain around the idea that there is something he does that doesn't revolve around you, but try, OK?      He likes to masturbate and look at porn.   IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.  It has nothing to do with whether he's "satisfied" with sex with you.    I guess what turns you off is that he has something he likes other than you.       Do the man a favor and quit seeing him.  Find some idiot who worships you and never has a thought without your permission, and you'll both be happier.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	just consider yourself lucky he's jsut doing that.  a lot of men go further and sleep with other women behind your back to satisfy their sex drives. it's not necessarily that he hates his sex life with you, but it's in our nature to want to mate with multiple partners.  some can keep it controlled and stick to 1 girl, some don't.  it's even hard for those that can whether they can admit it or not.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	if he is doing it when your not around i dont see the problem.|`|s30Duwdraa	You can't stop him from jerking-off!  It's just what they do even when they get laid on a regular basis.  It's second nature for men to please themselves...    Please try to let it go and enjoy the time you have together.  You should be happy that he's honest and comfortable enough to tell you about it, rather than hiding it from you.  Not to mention that his stamina is probably quite high if he's cleaning the pipes so often, which is always a bonus for us women!    and if you force him not to, it may create resentment.     It will be quite the challenge to find a man that doesn't masterbate!|`|jhNUuz0maa	He looks at porn to get aroused and masturbates to relieve the pressure. If you can't or don't want to have sex with him when he is wanting it, then you should be relieved he is only masturbating and not having sex with another woman while you are not there.    If I were you, I would get over the insecurity or he might find someone else who will either sleep with him every night, or won't mind him masturbating.     The best thing for you to do is ask him to not let you know he is doing it. If your sex life doesn't suffer from it, then there shouldn't be any complaints about it.|`|T6nvpX6zaa	The problem is that you have sex with your boyfriend.  You need to get into a relationship with a man that doesn't need sex to want to love you.  Then you can marry him and he'll be way less likely to 'cheat' with pornstars.  so, can't say it is surprising that unmarried men and women who have sex like they are married have problems.  If he gets the milk for free, why does he care how the cow feels?|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	All men masturbate no matter how much sex they are getting or how good it is.  All men watch porn, no matter how happy and fufilled they are in their relationship.  Get over it and learn to deal with it or dont date men.  Plain and simple.|`|70mNt7REaa	Honestly guys will always masturbate no matter what u do...u should try giving it up more time....And if you don't try and satisfy him more time trust me someone else will be happy to do so...|`|AA11996743	first  your not going to keep him from doing it ,, guys  do this,, i don't care if they say they don't,,,   they do.   and if you want  him to wait  for you ,, then do it for him  if he asks,,,, ok   suprise him ,, let him do it to you ,, as you tease him ..  or just tell him you want to watch him .       but you'll never keep him from doing  it,,,  he' hide it from you ,, so try to enjoy it together.|`|4GmeIopoaa	I do it too even though I have a boyfriend.  It's mainly because he's always tired when he gets home from work and its one thing or another.    If he would start having sex with me more I wouldnt feel the need to look at porn.

Do you have any close friends that are girls?  They may be able to answer your question a lot better than some people on the internet who don't know you.

Try going somewhere different for your social life.Also maybe you put up a barrier in case you,ll get hurt. The girls will see through this, you maybe frightening them off. Good luck honey, your ship will come in one day.|`|OzslGLjAaa	spending too much time on the internet trying to find out why you don't have a girlfriend likely contributes to your predicament.  Also, your standards may need to be re-evaluated, if you know what I mean.      But, more seriously, you are likely making all kinds of excuses (much like this one) to actually avoid girls.  You're probably using the "girls don't like me" as an excuse to stay inside your comfort zone.  This could all be the work of your sub conscience, you may not even know that you're doing it.  I get the feeling your young, and probably somewhat awkward.  The awkwardness will pass with time, but you should first just try making conversation with girls that you think may be suitable for you.  At least that's a good place to start.     Hope this helps.|`|nCBdJkbEaa	.. there can be A LOT of reasons why..|`|NnPizqKNaa	i'm sure they do just b nice 2 them|`|3cLWlMQxaa	Maybe because you spaz too much, like you're doing now.

pTSk4O8Aaa	concentrate on this girl!!!!!!1    http://www.sexyemilie.com/?id=1278065     she will keep your mind on only one thing!!!!|`|HMgRFOhqaa	You must be in touch with your 'feminine side' 'cos we blokes can't multitask, (so i've been told)
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	As long as they are happy, why does it matter where they met?  I know several people that met their perfect mates online.  In my opinion, it's not any different than meeting people in a bar, or anywhere else.  As long as people are rational about it, and don't jump into anything too quickly, there's nothing wrong with it.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	I give up!|`|NTUr0t3haa	I would feel better if they met the person in real life very quickly, rather than have a lengthy e-relationship, and the person appears to be respectable.     If I were the parent, I would be concerned until I found out that the person is respectable.|`|3PFJGzzsaa	what?!|`|PJ7Jh4cmaa	i would consider definitely that keeping healthy relation is not wrong.  i first will try to take maximum details to find out that whether real love exists or only for time pass. time pass will kill both the parties time.    every act of human being should have definitely some fruitful result. other wise what is the charm in getting to each other their are lot many other ways to kill time .so i will never go for unwanted friendship with any body to kill both the parties time  with warm regards  Robert Tobias
xiktW6dYaa	Well..  Here's an honest answer..  He might have used up all of his energy trying to get you off.   Also.. You shouldn't feel bad, you can't control your body.  At the most, he might be a little down, thinking he can't please you.  But next time you do something like this just tell him he is huge or something, this will def. boost his confidence lol.  And maybe go down on him next time if he didn't *** yet?|`|96ydDKocaa	i would say don't read to far in to this one chances are he was tired or distracted men dont just have an erection for hours or sometimes like your self it just wasn't his night to $%^ not a big deal enjoy your sex life just let him go when he is ready he will still be able to take care of you|`|TpaDRDogaa	He must of got to tired. but me and my boyfriend both go for a hour and sex and then do some other thing but i'm still able to make him ***.. it just depends on how he feels and how bad he really wanted to.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	Although it's nice to care, I'm 95% sure he really didn't mind last night.  Some men can "explode" with little drama, others have to scream and moan...kinda like women.    Men really don't want "great sex" that lasts longer than a few minutes, and they don't want long sex every day.  If they could they'd prefer "Minute Man Sex" any day:  fast and easy.      And now on to the sports...|`|BJERgbM5aa	Jeez, could you at least spared us the details.  Too much info for me.  He got tired.  Leave it alone.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	He's a man, not a machine. Just because he got tired, or it got uncomfortable or whatever the deal was, doesnt mean you did it.|`|TstiC2Ilaa	Well, from what you wrote, it sounds like he was doing all the work. Try getting on top sometime, that way you will both be pleased. :]|`|TBZNbhlNaa	don't worry about it bc it gets hard bc of testosterone and stamina he might have just started getting tired just bc of his body not you or him but bc his body couldn't take anymore|`|Wlh3b2vXaa	cumming for some girls can be very hard, but that doesnt mean you arnt being satisfied. More then half the time i have sex with my boyfriend i dontt finish but it doesnt mean i didnt enjoy it. Also, you dont have to be the first to finish, he can finish whenever he needs to. I dont think he got turned off or got tired of waiting. Sometimes guys just cant ***, it doesnt mean your the problem. He probably just jerks off too much.|`|QAccD2Mxaa	he was just tired ..its hard for guys to sustain a ***** for that long.YOu should be happy you get to *** b4 he did.next time when you *** b4 him ...let him rest and just give him some oral till he cums.I dont thik he was turned off ..it was just fatigue.|`|WYjyaMpKaa	answer 1) he may already have finished  answer 2) his heart may not have been in it, may have been tired and used all his energy!|`|dNrrT1gkaa	maybe he has ED? erectile dysfunction?  i doubt if u turned him off, dont worry about it|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	It happens! The act is not choreographed! ;-)=|`|fa6c64f5e8a85f1b4a65c7c52c3acd0caa	He may have been tired of trying to make you c^m.|`|3PFJGzzsaa	its vry hard 2 turn a guy off durin sex.
IPS3hWweaa	Wow, that would be really cool! I'd be mad if I didn't get her something. As soon as I had a chance I'd get her something for sure. I'm not sure what, but I'd find something.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	I hate girls,that sounds nice.|`|h7xh61TWaa	Take her out to dinner. A nice dinner.|`|gIszhbQNaa	Definitely. There are some songs I liked that wanted to buy :-D    Of course I would thank her. I would take her to a nice dinner.|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Sounds like a good idea.  Does he really like Hershey's bars or something?  Whatever his favorite is is what you should do.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	That sounds nice. I'm sure he'll enjoy it. Just make sure whatever candy you get, doesn't have peanut butter!!|`|maVkvkNZaa	I personally hate V-day, and it may make him feel pressured into following suite, but with boys it never hurts to try :)|`|uIg6an6Jaa	yea that would be sweet then gett her one of those giant teddy bears|`|fa6c64f5e8a85f1b4a65c7c52c3acd0caa	I think $15 is too much...    considering, you guys aren't together "yet".    Try $5 or $10.|`|xiktW6dYaa	Well..  If a girl did that for me, I'd feel all warm inside lol  Maybe write something a LITTLE bit flirtatious in the card.   But I think its a good idea, especially if you think he likes you back.
f8daaf4f3b625da7166d5b9cfc040254aa	If he has a girlfriend, leave him alone. No matter how much you like him. If he really likes you and is not just interested in getting in your pants then he will break up with his girlfriend. But if not, he's just after some snatch! Leave him alone!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Help you? Stay away from him. You don't want to be anywhere near a guy who would touch you when he has a girlfriend. He doesn't like or respect you or his girlfriend if he acted like that. If you got with him, he'd start feeling up other girls. Stay away from a player!|`|Q27cXlGbaa	is his girlfriend your friend ?    if not, go for it. you cant help who u like.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	if you ask me he was just going for wat he wants and his gf wont give him i really wouldnt make anything of it sry.|`|vQmb8XZPaa	that sounds like hes tryin to make u his.. go to girl.. dont do it..|`|aGno0HAwaa	What the heck is this? You are in love because he touched your boobs? ewwwwwwwwwww. Back off he is an *** hole who is a freak trying to touch girls even after having a girlfriend.|`|EBS8bjAwaa	alittle more info mite help alittle... But i think u should wait until he`s single|`|yW9ZmY13aa	um, go take a cold shower cuz if he cheats on her he will cheat on you too, u aint anymore special than she is|`|fYT2kOhqaa	He's taken, you just solved your own problem. Tell him to back off unless he's willing to leave his girl friend first. Just remember, if he does that to someone else, whats stopping him from doing it to you?|`|aKkDWz5Waa	i think he's an ***. But dnt worry, i dnt judge you- im well aware of what hormones can do!|`|cdf3e1235bb8fdfcc5571d382014cebfaa	Don't bother with him, he's just using you. Move on and find someone who wants you for you.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	He will cheat on you too.|`|QAccD2Mxaa	you know that's a no no ..if he is doing that with a girlfriend can you imagine how many other girls he wants to be doing that with.keep your emotions under control and don't get swept up by this buffoon.Golly ..this guy just wants your sex!|`|iNQK27Qqaa	guy sounds like a total tool, you would    A. be a home-wreaker    and he would be a cheater. and a cheater is a cheater for life|`|r7V2ZS7Vaa	Hey you're NOT the one in a relationship, but before you do anything mention to him that he has a girlfriend  let him decide on the rest of his actions.      BE CAREFUL he does have a GF and sinc eu "Really really really like him" your feeling can get hurt when or if everything blows over|`|O75Lt14daa	You know what everyone is going to say... dont do it. Not if he's involved. He's going to hurt you like he is hurting his girlfriend.|`|iJZyrk1daa	Do you have half a brain?|`|3PFJGzzsaa	HE IS A PIG! dnt fall for it!|`|iCuwFLURaa	Are you cheap, are you a product to be touched and groped by any ole bloke that comes along. If so then yeah let the fool grope you.     I am voicing my opinion to you, im not looking for the points. This guy is having his cake and eating it too, I don't know any woman that would let a guy get away with this and come here and ask for advice.     This is a no brain-er, fix the problem. If he has nothing to offer you, and by the way he sounds like to one of those guys who would get you pregnant and leave you holding the bag, then don't ever allow this to take place again. View the situation from the outside looking in, there are other people around you watching this guy do this to you, perhaps a potential guy friend and he is seeing you allow this to happen. What does this say about you? Get the Point? Fix the problem.|`|BUvPi5ldaa	If you go out with him when he's still going out with that girl, everyone who knows you will call you a skanky boyfriend stealing hoehoe. You don't want that do you?  Hope I helped =)
UX3xmWc6aa	a small kiss... and holding hands
zUZRPmYAaa	Don't do it, it will hurt her and its not worth it.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Your friend doesn't sound like a real friend. A friend would never talk trash to you. Or put you down. I would ditch her and do what you want. it's your life your friend should be an Ex friend. friends don't treat friends like she is doing to you.|`|utHfUAPtaa	GO FOR IT!    Altho i'd probibly never do that to a friend,but what sort of friend is she bad mouths you all the time....      Also whats rip & dip?????      lololol|`|0vQbPqbwaa	If he just wanted one thing with her then hes going to only want one thing with you....think about it|`|XjBXrL3Naa	Well you knew him first, you liked him first. But she fell in LOVE with him and probably still likes him, that's why she is trying to put you out of the picture.  Right now, my best friend is about to go out with my ex who broke up with me 2 weeks ago after 6 months together. I still love him and he knows it, but he asked out my best friend and she said yes... It's been very hard for me and you probably wouldn't want to put your friend through that...  Ask her if it's ok with her, that's the best thing you can do right now if you really want to be with him|`|ff1c2e48172050aa84a84803cabb7a5faa	I think you need to reevaluate why you are friends with this chick.  If you define her as your friend I would not go for it.  It's an unwritten law.  You don't date your friend's exes.  No matter what.  There are plenty of guys out there who are going to like you who are not your friend's ex.  Don't do it.  That's shady.
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	my fiance and i went to a craft store (hobby lobby specificly, they have amazing sales all the time), bought a bunch of cheap fishbowls (they dont look cheap, they just cost $2.00 each on sale) and some of those river rocks in our wedding colors, and we put them in the fishbowl with three votive candles.  all together, each centerpiece cost about $4.00.  we're toying with the idea of scattering rose petals around the outside of them just to dress them up a little bit more but we're not sure yet|`|4lL34wJnaa	Floating candles are very elegant and very inexpensive.  You can get bowls for about $7-$8 each and then candles cost about $8 per dozen and you only need like 3 candles in a bowl.  Then I would buy some tinted clear stones (in your chosen wedding colors) to decorate around the floating candle bowl...  The stones' cost will vary.  You can get them on Amazon.com or at your local Walmart or maybe a craft store.|`|Xp2De933aa	maybe a simple Flower arrangement for each table, nothing big, Also candles will do wonders in improving the look! good luck and congrats|`|vQmb8XZPaa	ok what im doing in my wedding.. ill let you know cuz im just amazing like this lol.. i have these weird shaped glasses and fill them up with water.. you can even dye the water a little bit of what color u like.. and put whatever flower u want under into the water.. or put candles to float on top or a long candle coming thru the middle of all the flowers kind of holding the candle in place.. does that kind of make sense?.. anyway.. thats what im doing and puttin petals on the table around the tall glasses|`|yhgRaBPXaa	It depends on what colors you are using, but my colors were peacock colors. I used two peacock feathers in a tall glass vase. They looked really pretty and only cost a about $5 a piece.|`|woOeYFrEaa	We spent about $20/table.      $1 for a square cloth napkin in the wedding colors to put at the center of the table.    $4 for 3 different votive/tealight candles    $15 for a simple bunch of tulips from our florist (he loaned us the vases for free).|`|ApHLa19Faa	We used floral candle rings bought at Michael's, on sale for less than $5 each. Then we bought glass plates and pillar candles from the dollar store.They looked great!    You could also use simple glass bowls bought at a dollar store, and put floating candles in them.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	Hobby Lobby has lots of new spring/summer stuff right now that is inexpensive. It depends on your theme or colors. They have these really cute painted pails in different colors that you could put candles or flowers in.   You can also get paper lanterns. They come battery operated with a base and small enough to look nice on a table. They have them in several different colors as well, under $5.  http://www.asianideas.com/lanterns2.html|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	I too am getting married in July. I'm getting 10 inch tall clear glass cylinders from the dollar store and filling it with real red rose petals and water so they float and fill it up with beautiful color and then topping it off with a white floating candle.|`|stiEynPbaa	Go to the David's Bridal website and look for some inexpensive favors.   You can arrange them with maybe a few flowers in the center of the table and then tell your guests to take one home with them!    I'm not engaged or anything, but I'm going to be a wedding planner when I get out of college.   For my own wedding, I want to have a rustic-themed reception, and I found the cutest little mini lanterns! I'm going to decorate my tables with those, and have them around a simple flower display. :)    Have fun with it!|`|sLLgERQWaa	Clear glass bowl. Fill halfway with clear glass or tinted glass pebbles.   In the center place a small battery operated tea light....place on a mirror 'coaster'. Just before the reception, switch the tea light on an push down into the pebbles....the light will reflect within the pebbles and the mirror will enhance the effect...items can be found at Michael's or Hobby Lobby Stores.    At Bed, Bath & Beyond you can purchase pillar 'candles' that are battery operated for about 12 bucks each ( or get the real deal).....find plate chargers you like. Place candle pillar in center of charger & surround with 1) flowers either real or silk 2) glass pebbles or stones  3) small sea shells 4) or any item that reflects your 'theme'    A strand of battery operated clear twinkle lights (white wires), (think x-mas lights) filling a tall cylindrical glass vase....very cool. Place on mirror coasters .    I have a bronze- gold glass charger for Hobby Lobby with a pebbled texture, a battery operated pillar candle from Bed Bath & Beyond (the one with a real candle wax outside coating) surrounded by an assortment of smooth river stones and glass pebble mix as a centerpiece on my sofa table....I get constant compliments on it...looks very expensive and it ain't. When I turn on the candle the glow & reflection on the pebbles & charger is beautiful.....  ...good luck.|`|11qdMtlGaa	I am getting married in May and what we are doing is we found some old mason jars and we are putting fruit in them with flowers on top   http://www.cateredforyou.com/images/Cent...  We are using lemons (put any fruit would work) and that gel stuff (so it doesn't take as many lemons) and just daisies on top (or any flower arrangements)..it doesn't cost that much because lemons and daises are not that expensive plus it gives a nice fruit smell..hope this is any help
JlDcVTVsaa	reading your other questions as well, i think your bf is  1.hiding some thing from you.   2.or he has commitment problems.  3.or he is just doing this because he has realized that every time, he threatens you, he gets what he wants, even if he doesnt  deserve it.     you sound like a sweet girl, but you are giving him too much in this relationship.|`|o2WxTgfjaa	Kinda simple really...Something about you that you don't even realize has changed and it's affecting your mood and you just don't realize it.   and maybe he doesn't have interest in you or interest in someone else and is looking for an excuse to get out...that'd be REALLY low but im just saying. Don't accuse him of anything like cheating or anything!!! but, you really need to talk to him about it and ask what he means by it, like what he thinks is different about you.     And, other people may notice this too...they may deny it, but, really look at yourself and maybe journal of what you did everyday, what you said to ppl, how you felt ect  talk with other people who will be very blunt with you and ask if they notice anything different about you and/or your attitude
r1cDHOsHaa	Personality is the most imortant thing. It doesn't matter if someone is GEORGEOUS, they could have no sense of humor, no "good conversations", and be a jerk.  So personality is the number one thing i go for and i don't care what my friends say about the guy.   looks are a bonus, you don't have to be amazingly attractive, but it's nice to have your good features. =)|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Personality is most important. There are a lot of hot jerks out there! You can fix your small imperfections, you just gotta know how. Try going to a dermatologist. It sounds like you have eczema on your face and need a good moisturizer so you can shave pain free. As far as your teeth, ask the dentist about whitening or get a whitening kit at the drug store.|`|y1TDricRaa	for me its personality first cuz a person with great personality can make them attractive.  And those problems you have can be fixed.  Try looking into some alternative medicine and maybe look into seeing a naturopathic doctor instead.|`|LihoWe84aa	definately personality  Rebecca|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i dont want to sound mean but clean yourself up mate as your teeth  clean them .. wash your face every two hours ..with clean soap... and watch the change come on ... good luck mate i did it so can you|`|KcUX0WCeaa	I'm a girl who LOVES a great personality and the guy could pretty much look like anything, but there are a few things that I just cannot tolorate...so at the risk of sounding like an asshole:  okay, well...ingrown hairs on your facial hair isn't good.  Maybe u could try growing it out or threading (Even though it hurts more the ingrown hairs and razor burn will be a problem of yesterday).  skinny, girl fingers i hate.  bad breath and crusties on teeth is a deal breaker.  Greasy hair--tells a girl that your greasy in other places, so that's kind of important.  I'm really sorry you are having a hard time with the ladies.  There are just somethings that even the strongest lady cant overlook.  A personality is EXTREMELY important and a lot girls forget to look for that first, but sexual attraction is also extremely important too.  Good luck.|`|yW9ZmY13aa	find someone who isnt shallow and she will think that you are the most important thing, not just certain things about you|`|JCdBSULraa	Girls will tell you it's personality even if they care more about looks, so there's not much point in asking them.  I will say that different girls have different preferences, and if you really have to ask a question like this, you're at least a little self-conscious, and girls hate that in a guy's personality.|`|PwgDhNyNaa	personality is more important but the first thing you see is the face.|`|XnS9mbixaa	personality! never let anyone tell you diffrent!!|`|aGno0HAwaa	I will tell you what I like in a guy:    I do like smart guys. Well smartness is not everything, he should have some love and care from his side, if it is only the education then he is not worth it without any kindness and only a nerd. That is no use to me.    He should be caring and loving and intelligent as well. What is the point in loving a dumb guy? How will he run the family by the way?    I don't care how he looks. Looks are nothing to me unless he is my type. I really am hooked with this guy at school, he is smart and sexy really. Good luck to you.|`|URxUGoUMaa	well personality is very importantt, looks are only important as far as being attracted to someone, they dont have to be stunning. little flaws arent important.   mostlyy, its about being suited to a person    xx|`|qmcZPFiXaa	Personality is more important. If the person has a good personality, then you'll think they look good. If the person looks good to me, I don't really care what other people think.|`|HvpEZrpvaa	OF COURSE personality !! But still u have to take care of ur look..i mean don't go out without wearing something proper and expect people to like U..|`|lKaIrv9Aaa	All the way personality!  And if you get lucky, you'll get good looks too ;)|`|PyneTJPmaa	Personality definitely,
qDpFSqn4aa	How about inviting him out for a coffee or something like that?  You two can sit and talk while having the coffee then you can tip toe through his mind.  Let him know that you have feelings for him.  If he's so shy then it's going to be up to you to make your dates a little more interesting.  I know it's not the old fashioned way (I'm old fashioned) but it is the new way.  Girls can now ask guys out without being thought of a slut or something.  Maybe it's just time for you to step in and make some decisions about your relationship.  Get it off the ground.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|rMeuCOtLaa	jus tell him u like him       it wil bring out confidence xxxx|`|tAowsaGTaa	tell him you want him to be more open with you and how him not opening up to you makes you feel kind of bad or you can just ask him " why wont you open up to me" but id personally go with the first one|`|lS32BUy8aa	The key to every relationship is Communication. Just tell him. Some times you gotta be blunt. Good Luck!|`|y1TDricRaa	he's shy you know that, so just ask him out and then if he says yes, he'll open up more later on.  Just go for it
aiDV9FgGaa	Staying together for your kids is the most responsible thing you can do. The kids didn't ask to be born, and they deserve a whole home. They are more than likely ambivolent to your differences with your wife. Wait until they are old enough to understand what is hppending before proceeding with a seperation.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	If you think you can co-parent with the children's mother, it's probably better to separate. I was in a bad marriage and I stayed because I had 3 kids. I left when the youngest was 17. Once we split, all 3 of my children told me they wish we had split sooner. They all said they would rather see their parents happy and apart than miserable and together. Also keep in mind that you are teaching your children that it's ok to settle for a crappy marriage.  Good luck. Just remember, your children ALWAYS come first and stay involved in their lives as much as you possibly can. When a divorce devastates children it's usually because one (or both) are too immature to work with the ex to make sure these children get the best of both of you.|`|1l04qpOKaa	The best thing you can do is not stay married for the sake of your children. Ending things with your wife may give you a better chance to stay friends with her after all the wounds heal. Rather than being in an unhappy marriage that will also make your children unhappy. Your children will not understand right away but someday they will when they are adults. It's never an easy situation, but you have to do what you feel is right. If you aren't ready to give up your marriage try getting counseling, talk to your wife and see how she feels too. Good luck  :o)|`|j7l9gavRaa	people say broken homes but once the marriage has turned sour that house is more toxic than anything, get divorced and you and your "ex" will be happier and the kids will follow suit, it is not that big of a deal and your kids will have tons of friends at school in the exact same boat as them|`|OBCvewW2aa	My honest and truthful opinion is that broken homes are not as bad as they're cracked up to be.  In fact, the current president of the United States comes from one.  And my son, who is brilliant, well-adjusted and perfect in every way also comes from one.  Me too, but I'm not such a good example.    That being said, if you do decide to divorce, you should stay in the same town.|`|h7xh61TWaa	To be honest. You guys haven't lost hope, you can rekindle what you had when you met. I am sure you have work on your marriage before you came here, have you seen a Marriage Counselor? I would go see one.     It would be best for your kids if you worked it out. The 3 year old won't be affected that much but the 6 year old is definately old enough to notice but not understand.    I would hate you staying in a unhappy marriage, that just leaves both of you miserable. I would also hate to see two people separate cause they haven't tried to reconnect.     Good Luck.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	although the children would be hurt if you left, i think that is the best. you only have one life and it is way short to not be happy and be able to give the love you have to give to someone. i left my 2 sons ages 4 and 2 when i asked my wife he she loved me and told me no but she liked having me around. that was enough for me. i wasn't going to spend the rest of my life being with someone just because i was convenient for her. yes it was hard on the kids at first, but as time went on they were fine . i had a talk with them saying mom and dad's should love each other and it wasn't the case here. they are in their late teens now and totally understand and agreed with my why i left. it was the hardest thing i ever done, but children living in an environment where the parents are more like room mates than husband and wife isn't healthy either. you will find someone to love and who loves you back and your children will love who ever you find and  you will be kicking yourself for not doing something about it sooner. things will be just fine, and you my friend will be happy you  moved on.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think you should just go out and do what you want. Maybe if you go out and have fun more often, it wouldn't bother you so much to have a wife you have nothing in common with. I am not saying cheat on her..but I think the children do need their parents. I think the kids would be fine either way..but it will be harder for each of you to have them alone. I don't know...I think you all need to take more vacations. Don't rush to divorce. Try to fix it first and tell her how you feel, and ask her how she feels.|`|MYbRICxqaa	I really feel for you. Your decision is going to be hard either way. Good Luck.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I think any marriage can be saved. Divorce is not the answer wouldnt you rather be happy and with your family. I want to suggest you go out and watch the movie called fireproof, then buy the book and follow the steps. I promise it will help you and if not what is a few days more of being with the wife and kids. Please consider this it helped my marriage out tremindously.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	You already have a "broken home",try to be happy for yourself,it's never too late.If your wife is unhappy too,she'll understand,maybe she's even waiting for you to call it quits,your kids will go tru a thought time,but I'm sure they'll understand too,and at the end it will be all worth it...  When ppl get marry they don't do it to get divorce,but you dont have to be marry and unhappy,every one deserves to be happy! at least once...  Good luck!|`|x3LclBZ0aa	im sorry youre going thru this. ive been in your situation before. i got married straight out of college to a man i thought i loved. i stayed for 7 yrs and we had a son together. for the last 2 yrs of the relationship i literally felt like i was dying slowly inside. the only light i had was my son. it got to the point where i couldnt even stand to be intimate with him anymore. my whole family begged me to stay and make it work if only for our son's sake but i knew deep inside i couldnt. so i ended it. it was definitely one of the darkest moments of my life (there were things he did and threatened me with that are just too horrible to mention here)   well its been more than 6 yrs and we eventually patched things up to where were friends now. and my son is already 11 yrs old and doing really well (not without any challenges of course) we just stayed in contact together as "parents".  whatever you choose to do, it will be difficult but rest assure that everything will fall into place with time. try and see if you can get some professional help maybe to give the relationship another shot.   you will know when its the right time what your decision will be.  i wish you the best of luck.|`|e968aa32bb334d18f54e0f0a7cbe78d1aa	Time to split up. No one thanks their parents for staying together and being unhappy. I certainly didnt thank mine for it. it sets a bad example. Split up. Good luck. Better alone than unhappy.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	"the question is which is the lesser of the two evils".  For kids the best for a healthy state of mind and further development  is to be with both parents in a loving and caring home.  I`d stay for the children, if I made one mistake -that is ruining my life- I wouldn`t make a bigger mistake for ruining theirs. Try to reverse damages don`t making things worse. That is if I were you, but you have your own feelings about. I wish you the best and for your kids.|`|oZ8onqsLaa	To quote Dr. Phil (this is a great point)   What's worse then being unhappily married for 7.5 years? Being unhappily married for 7.5 years and 1 day.     Don't stay together for the kids. They are smarter then you are giving them credit for and know when things are off between mom and dad.|`|3ywVS2JEaa	i'm in the same position,,lots of ppl out there are living the same way,,,i'm still hanging in there,,for the sake of my children as well,,,|`|wlupqLrBaa	I think when your kids grow old enough to understand they will appreciate 2 happy, seperated parents. Even though it's not easy in the beginning for them, you have to follow your heart and if it was me, I would respect my husband more for being brave and honest and doing me the favour of not wasting my time. You could both move on and be happier.    Hope this helps and good luck x|`|AWb0L9IKaa	trying to pretend as if all is well is worse, so ideally you should both go your separate ways since you are not happy in the relationship.|`|8fd15b64214f2ed938ae8aea46720501aa	I could have just posted this myself. Glad to see I am not alone.  I feel that no matter how much we put our children first, at some point you know when you are too miserable to try to stay and make it work for their sake.  When you have reached that point, then you are better off apart.  Easier said then done obviously.  I think a shared custody if possible, is best for all parties.  I think I am no longer a believer in the fairytale and will not remarry again.  I think it is best if parents can figure it out and not let it get to the courts to decide, and I also believe children will be ok if the parents are responsible adults and mature about this.  I also think it is ok to want a divorce without infidelity or abuse being an issue.  People grow apart and that is part of life.  Children will understand and they will be fine.  Now only if I can get my husband to agree with me. lol|`|dtHjJah5aa	Get divorced.  It's better to have children raised in two homes by two happy people than for them to be stiffled in a unhappy home by two unhappy people.  That's my opinion.  Good luck.   And I'm sorry.|`|fTiXy11caa	what I'm hearing is that you are not necessarily unhappy, just that your wife is not quite what you would like her to be.  You would just like to program her to do all the things you like to do, and do all the things that please you and make your life good.  Now hear this:  It is not your wife's responsibility to make you happy!  It is your own!  So if you are not happy, get out there and do something about it!  Don't worry if your wife is the complete opposite of you!  That actually provides balance in your relationship!  Think about a song:  There's a melody and a harmony and they are completely different.  Together they make beautiful music!   Your children need you!  Dont think of you and your wife as a couple.  Think of you and your wife as parents, and part of a wonderful family!    HTH!|`|YUtUsxLbaa	After teaching in public schools for a decade, I've seen that divorce is better, if you can keep things friendly.  The cases where things got worse involved parents who used the kids to get back at each other.  When both parents care about the kids and put their needs above their own pettiness, it can work out well and be healthy for everyone involved.  Staying together just for the kids doesn't really help teach some of the morals most parents try to instill in their kids.  Yes, perhaps it can help them understand that you love them, but it doesn't teach them to be happy when they grow up and you can do a lot of other things to help them feel loved.  Good luck.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Read about you make me see myself and my relationship. But because we have kid and that a first thing I thinking about. Stay unhappy for me may be better than let my kid stay with out father even though by law woman get a lot more advantage like CSA and help from centre link..but not worth to call quits by my opinion. (especially you are a man, should think twice and put the kids first) Try to source the problem is not easy about relationship and it depend on so many thing. You might need counselling may be but don't quit yet until last. Try to think positive and find out, something beautiful about her must don't look over it, I mean she must have something good but you now don't see or ignore it because life together long and boring. And don't sorry for yourself...you are a lot better than a lot of couple, you know. Good luck and don't give up your family.|`|T272vObnaa	Move on with your life.  Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you've lost your rights to a happy life.  I think seeing you unhappy and broken-down will affect your children more negatively than a divorce.  Hopefully your wife will be understanding and ready to move on with her life too, and see that she also deserves happiness.  Good luck.|`|xGshAiXOaa	My parents divorced when I was 1, and I don't feel as though I missed out on anything because of it.  In fact, I was blessed with FOUR parents that love me more than anything.  I had four sets of ears to listen if I had a problem, four sets of eyes to look out for me (not always appreciated), and four mouths that gave me more advice than I knew what to do with at the time.      I didn't have a 'broken home' I had two homes that were sturdy as could be.|`|Syn2MwSHaa	i would try councling first and try to get interested in some things she likes and see if she would do same and if nothing works then you might have to divorce but never argue in front of kids mildred is my leader

029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	I can relate....sometimes I think I emit "people repellent".     All I can say is God made us the way we are, as far as being more quiet and introverted. Through Him alone I am bold. I have friends...not close, true friends but people that are nice. I also function just fine at work or in public...but deep down I would be happy being at home, keeping to myself.    Do some Bible study and join a group of people that have the same interests that you do.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Plzzzz Is not a word.

You don't need, "true" friends.  You need friends, so you can hang out first, true friends will come in time.    I'm still an introvert, but i like my people. :]|`|tXXie5yqaa	Happens.........................lifes a *****..........|`|NWwGl4k6aa	here is my assignment for you.  got to the mall or any high traffic area.  say "hi" to 10-20 strangers.  you don't have to say anyhting more.  just "hi"  if a conversation starts up, good for you.  at the very least you'll get accustomed to being less shy about approaching people.  trust me on this one.    EDIT:  do NOT play runescape or WoW like some of these clowns are suggesting, unless you want to further damage your social skills.  real life person to person contact can not be replaced by a computer screen and fighting pixel demons with friends you never met.  reading those suggestions reminds me that misery really does love company|`|OYzPApodaa	Why do you feel no one likes you?  Have they said so or is this more your feelings?    Do you belong to a church or community organization where you can find like minded people who will be open to new friends?    Maybe its just that the people who you currently know are not the kinds of friends you need.  All one needs really is one good friend.  I personally find that prayer helps me to sort out the feelings I have about others...is this something you have tried?    Remember true happiness has to first be found within ones self  then after you can be happy in any circumstance you'll will automatically attract others. (joy is attractive)    Do you have a hobby that you can feel good about like making models  or gardening? Then join a gardening club....this is a way to find like minded people who share your interest. It makes it easier to have conversations when you share common interests.  Good Luck|`|SivOCxSAaa	play runescape|`|KRf30XAHaa	play runescape tibia or if u have money buy world of war craft there are tons of people on that|`|yW9ZmY13aa	go find people interested in the same things as you and force urself to talk|`|DuiYoSf1aa	just relax. keep smiling and you will be fine. people probably think you are too good for them and maybe you should approach people who like people for who they are not just people who like themselves.  if you are a nice and friendly person you will have NO trouble making friends as long as you do try.xxx.  good luck xx|`|3q9cIGsyaa	are you a friendly + nice + caring + trustworthy person  if you are then their the ones missing out arnt they  dont worry about it just live your life to the max true friends happen in time + life long friendships get to know people trust in yourself as well as them + rememba theres always your family there that care about youu + love you more than enything!

ZHJUTlXwaa	Hey, I have a four year gap between my girlfriend and I. We've been together nearly 2 years now. While I trust that you can be mature for your age, as my gf is, also, girls mature faster than boys.    Between 13 and 17 you do A LOT of growing, each of you. Though you may not be planning on having sex, I highly doubt he will be having the same thoughts. He'll be far more sexually mature than you and it's not really something you should get into at a young age.    Also, with the parents disapproving it makes things really hard. at this point I'd say just be friends. But if you can't do that, invite him over or something so your parents can get to know him, as a friend, maybe with other friends. Then to them its not "some stranger dating my daughter". But without the parents on your side, I really don't think it can work at 13, you're too reliant on them.    -b|`|D6yEjfciaa	are you crazy there is something wrong with him.he could be dating some fine babydolls who are 20yrs. old  have a car and money. and everything.  but instead he is with a little kid. don't take it wrong you are still young . but the guy is messed up in the head. stay away from him. he might say he loves you. but just wait when some other gilr  his age makes a move on him and it will happen he will go for it. and if you stay with him you can just forget about ever having any real fun.  think about this, try dating a kid four years younger than you.kindda sick huh? thats what he is doing.
1CqAQ3rlaa	you cant compete with a man in uniform...women love that..  to her she sees in him,strength,bravery,heroism,patriotic, safety, maturity,,discipline, and a future. you are some little boy she went out with in high school..  she is just not that into you anymore..she found a man!  let her go and let her be happy,,she sees you are part of her life,,as kids growing up..and her feelings have changed..its all apart of growing up..its sucks you have been replaced with a man in uniform,,and that hard to compete with..good luck and let her go..as hard as it is..
OkR3hrzZaa	No. Your heart can be misleading. Your conscience is telling you the right thing. If your having doubts, its for a reason. Your heart can go on impulse and lust and that can be very misleading. Listen to your conscience. Good luck.|`|AA10874773	you shouldnt.  remember the old saying your first impression is usually right?  i'd stick with that.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No not a good idea.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	no, i would stay away from him.

Be a good friend and encourage her to find someone else!|`|98NiEivhaa	my answer is more directed at the other answerers...    seeing someone about to be divorced does not make them a cheater or a liar.    im not divorced yet, but im seeing a great girl.  i wish i could just walk up to a vending machine and put money in and have a divorce pop out, but it doesn't work that way.  im neither a cheater or a liar, i'm just carrying on with my life now (my ex left me, not the other way around)    but to the question now, i think that is selfish of her... i want full custody of my kids, and im sure i'll get it... but i don't want anyone that doesn't want my kids, because they are the most important part of my life, above anyone or anything else... and always will be.  if she cant get that, she isn't a good choice for him anyways.... she's just tail and nothing more|`|wlupqLrBaa	Very much so, if she really cared for him she would care for his children also.

Perhaps look into getting a job for these 3 months and meeting people that way.  Volunteer.  Call any animal hospitals or shelters and/or hospitals in your area and see what you need to do.

Getting a new girl so fast makes it real bad. because of this exact situation.. next time wait a few months and just go on dates nothing serious until you know you are done.|`|96ydDKocaa	sounds to me your ex girl friend either just wants what she cant have or like a friend of mine doesn't want you but doesn't want any one else to have you ..if you've made every attempt to get beck with your ex and she didn't want any part of you shes just jealous that you have a new girl. stay with your new girl if she really likes you and you have a good relationship so far chances are if you go back to your ex there's gonna still be problems in the relationship|`|Slr6jtMGaa	Well, this sounds like my previous dating problem...except....i'm the girl who broke up with the guy, started dating a guy(his name was Corey H.....which is weird lol) for 2 months.....but it turned out that i loved my ex WAY too much.....and that corey guy was an idiot.....i cryed alot too....just like your ex is doing.....    Meanwhile, my ex kept calling me, coming to see me(basically chasing me....to get me back).....then i finally broke up with the other guy....    Now i'm engaged to my first love....(the one that i broke up with in the first place)    ps    opposites attract......usually people having things in common end up getting on each others nerves.....but everyone is different....|`|V2r0HRKjaa	Talk to your ex about things. She might not want you back just can't take seeing you with another girl.  In that case give the other girl a fair chance and explain to her that you have not completely gotten over your ex.  She might just want to be friends or for you guys to take things a little slower!|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Now you know why she didn't go skating with you ... 2nd fiddles won't compete :b/c they know they have harmony....! A woman wants to know SHE is the only one!|`|bV1cnEx6aa	just act like you dont care and watch how she start liking you more|`|uIg6an6Jaa	do you still want your ex or do you honestly really like the new girl|`|v3jDiuRraa	go out with the ex|`|JNkurzBWaa	i dont think you have given yourself long enough to be single to experience single life on your own and to really get your ex out of your system.....whether you and your ex ever get back together is somewhat irrelevant because the fact that your hanging onto this shows that you are not ready yet for a new relationship.....on the other hand the new girl doesnt really stand a chance because on no fault of hers she has only been seeing you 2 months your ex has 3 years behind her....so of course the bond between you and your ex will be stronger.....its up to you what you do from here but i would suggest some breathing space.....not to try and get back with your ex but to actually have some time to figure out how you really feel.....be honest with your new girlf tell her your not sure you are ready for a new relationship...its so easy to fall out of one relationship inot another (we are habitual creatures) but if you dont give yourself time then even if this new girl is for you it wont feel right|`|CtFYFOlVaa	You follow your heart. The last relationship lasted 3 years for a reason and it also ended for a reason. Maybe she does want you now that you have a new girl women are like that they all have a little jealousy in them but in your situation the best thing to do is trust your instincts you only live once|`|B4lvfU2yaa	you can talk to your ex about what you think is going on, and ask her why she cried, just because your not seeing each other doesn't mean you cant talk to her. then talk to your new gf about that too.  Then from there you can make what you think is your best move, listen to your heart and you'll never go wrong.
PtHTwCcZaa	i know how you feel, i grew up with my older sister constantly getting me into trouble for things that she did! to be honest there isn't much you can do. when you get older, you will eventually come to like and respect eachother, yes i know its annoying to hear it, i never believed people, but me and my sis are now best friends and talk through everything with eachother. sorry i have no real solution, but don't give up hope! maybe just give her her space, thats all i can suggest.|`|2eHFbEstaa	suck it up ok|`|v10vP5Hdaa	maybe you really need to sit down wit your sister and talk to her
CSWHwlzvaa	Ooh difficult one - you are naturally concerned,  as I think most people would be.Can't you help her to find a different job? Could be a strain on the relationship otherwise.|`|BJERgbM5aa	She's telling you it's temporary because she knows that job will 'burn you up'.  But she's going to do it anyway.  Believe me, that job is trouble.  Not for her, for you.  Not to many guys can live with that kind of situation.  I'm  guessing that you're in the mainstream.  Trouble, my friend.  With a capital T that rhymes with D that stands for DUMP HER.  She really doesn't care how you feel about the whole thing, so why should you care about her.  You love her?  Does she love you back.  I don't think so.|`|AA11209233	If you can't handle it, break up.  It sounds like you want to make it work though.  I think the way you do that is with ground rules.      You do understand that stripping is sorta like being a carney--people come for sex even though they know they won't get any, and she separates men from their dollar bills without giving them anything but a smile.  Sure she may get a rich guy making an obnoxious offer, some weirdo stalking her, or some other problem, but she isn't a rookie and probably knows how to deal with these issues.  Also, since you are already her boyfriend, it's different for you than for someone deciding whether to date someone who is already a stripper.  You aren't just a mark to her.  Even if she starts seeing men as suckers, she won't see you that way.      Talk about your concerns.  You can tell her you don't like the idea without ordering her not to do it.  I think you could work something out that you could live with.  If you are way too jealous for that, then tell her she can't, but know that that could hurt things between the two of you.      Of course, the other option is to find a real job for her.  If she has the qualifications to get an interview, she is probably charming enough to ace it, so make sure she knows what is out there.  There is a chance she gave up on searching too early because she knows she can get easy money this way.|`|AA10394452	There is no way that you 'should' feel, the way you truly feel is right.You really have to listen to yourself here and keep your best interests in mind. After all, that is what she is doing. Yes it is good money, but can lead to many self destructive habits/people. If you don't think you can handle it, go. It wouldn't be easy but you don't want to suffer in your relationship, either.|`|TstiC2Ilaa	DON'T do it! Trust me. One of my closest friends Kevin had been dating this girl who was so sweet and had danced once or twice before. Then decided she wanted that as a career to help her out because they had a kid...and it all went to hell after that. She started doing drugs, started cheating, drinking all the time...it's just really a bad enviremont. And he could barely trust her, knowing her job was to take her clothes off for men. I know you want to support her, but a job like that can kill a relationship easily. Try and help her find another good paying job. There are better ways than being a stripper.|`|1LxK1Grcaa	Cant tell you how you should feel, how you feel is how you feel.  If your not comfortable with it talk to her about how you feel. If you love her you should be able to talk to her.|`|qZ0310yVaa	lose her now before you get hurt|`|fa6c64f5e8a85f1b4a65c7c52c3acd0caa	Wow, tough one.    If you really love her, I say you stick with her till the end.    I know you'd be jealous of all the guys looking at her, but remember that you're the one she comes home at night to. ;)|`|tcWp6pC8aa	If Its What She Wants To Do You Should Support Her  At Least She Told You And Didn't Go Ahead And Do It Behind Your Back  Its Only Temporarily Like She Said So You Should Trust Her If You Love Her So Much You Shouldn't Mind Stop Being Jealous And Get A Grip!  Good Luck:)|`|AA11765818	she's not the only one who's having  struggles now that economy is down... a lot of people are having a hard time... are all of them considering to choose stripping as an option? no!    if she insists and ur not comfortable about it, then leave her. u are only concerned about her welfare. if she doesn't realize that, then she doesn't deserve you.|`|KncPJwIaaa	My man get out of the relationship if you cant stand being jealous cause your mind will wonder and what she tell you after a while you believe her its just the way of the mind but if you can deal with that go for it but i was in that predicament and it sucked for me but it might just be different for you
aDIPIu7xaa	I think the "Over the Hill" idea is RETARDED for a 30 year old.  Sorry!    Try a "Dress like you did in High School" party- way more fun!  Or a 80's party.....|`|IGaFwY07aa	surprise "over the hill" theme is a lot of fun.....appetizers and drinks....cant go wrong......have all adults and possibly a stripper...hehehe!!|`|4cdq26oraa	Depends on the guy. Some guys like to have a big party in their honor and the over-the-hill thing is perfect. Invite all your co-friends and his other friends (less of just yours).   However, if he's the type of guy that doesn't like big surprise parties, then don't do it. Instead maybe plan a get-away for just the two of you somewhere. Maybe a short warm weather vacation or weekend get-away to somewhere he'd like to go with just you.   You know him better than I, so do something he'll enjoy.
fL3SiRDWaa	Go to your classes, yeah it might suck but I guarantee you will feel worse for missing your classes.    And also, in the long term you're going to have to make up for your work lost.    Trust me, my first quarter in college I was doing great, and I was working for the dorms and I lost my job, and I was so upset, and I sat in my friends car all day crying, feeling sorry for myself and skipped my first class.    And after that, I was like well its only one class, its going to be ok.  No, it wasnt okay, I fell behind.    Just go, what worse could happen?     You'll be exhausted when you get back and sleep good, and tomorrow is a new day.

Ask her about fanasies and share yours. Talk about what the perfect porn video scene would be. This sparks up interesting ideas and gets almost anyone in the ood by just simply talking about it.
VbkETtYHaa	If you really want to intervene, you can work with the department of family services, which I'm sure has been involved at one point or another due to his mother's drug use and etc.. Also, your mother can apply for full custody of him so that she is the one who receives the support in order to continue to care for him.  You may need to call in a new case to the department of family services or children's services, or whatever it is called in your state/town.|`|yLNsOJiQaa	I receive checks from SS for my son because is biological father is deceased and of course if when can set some back for him we do.  However, most if goes towards things that he needs because that is what it is to be used for.      This is a touchy subject but if you know without a doubt, and obviously you do, that she is using it for other things than supporting her son then you need to contact SS.  Since, the money is coming from the father you need to have his, the fathers, SSN .  This is because the account is listed under him even though the child is the beneficiary.  You need to call SS and tell them what is going on and that the child has been in the care of his grandmother and what the mother has been doing.  SS does not take light to how the money is spent.  It is strictly there for paying for the needs of the child not to buy drugs and party.     I am not sure but SS may have her send proof that she has been taking care of the boy or try to have her get guardianship of him before they send the checks to the grandmother.  Also, SS does do direct deposit instead of sending checks.  So, if she does not want to hassle with checks she can have the money direct deposit into her account.    I would call SS and let them know what is going on and they can then lead to what steps need to be taken next.      Hope this helps.
2s82NH6Zaa	No, she doesn't like you.  Not sure why you'd waste time on her anyway - she sounds two faced.|`|saUmiEogaa	Overall I think she does like you. At the same time that whole waiting to be married deal sounds kinda sour. Talk to her and see where she stands " Baby you like me or not cause there are a line of other chicks waiting for me". Not so much in those words but I think you get what I'm saying.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Nope.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	she making a fool out of you.. tell her to drop off .. with the names calling .. and get over her .. shes the fool here not you ..|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	her dad must like you if he was joking about the marriage thing. she does like you.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Maybe she's just really weird, in which case, treat her like she treats you. Make fun of her, throw dirt at her, call her names, and spit in her drink. Maybe she'll surprise you with a swift kick to the groin area, then kiss you and fall deeply in love with you?     Or maybe she's just mean in front of her friends because she doesn't like you, and nice when you're alone to use you...|`|YsZqNHOhaa	Maybe, if she acts different when it's just you two then maybe. Is she around her friends when she's mean to you? If she is, she's probably trying to hide the fact that she likes you, she sounds like a nice girl when its just you & her. Defo talk to her.    good luck    Xx|`|SQszBtJjaa	no,not a chance|`|WYjyaMpKaa	nope probably not|`|3PFJGzzsaa	haha.. i do this! she does like you!|`|QAccD2Mxaa	she is probably been a ***** to you to cover her real feelings ,best to let her know you dont appreciate that and would like if you guys could get along better..whichever way that is|`|b7WEVGzXaa	well i think she is just being flirty  ]you have been trying for months   and she is not doing anything  so just move on  there are other great girls that will treat you the same when everyonis around and wken you guys are alone    so just keep looking :)|`|iJZyrk1daa	I think you need to find a new girlfriend. One that wil be consistant in the way she treats you.  If she likes you then she should be able to show that no matter if you are alone or with a group.|`|iCuwFLURaa	Dude,     Invite her and her family out to dinner or something, go bowling and get her in a place where she is not around the influence of friends. By doing this you are disarming her of confluence.     When you have a chance to speak with her, make it count. Allow your nuggets to fall from your belly and be a man, simply tell her- Im interested in getting know you better, and I think you are as well but I am getting mixed signals. Ask her how she feels about it, don't look her in the eyes, she seems very impressionable and may not offer you an honest answer. You want her to be able to give you her opinion and voice her feelings without feeling pressured by you.     You have a friend and that is important, the goal here is not to immediately obtain a girlfriend but to establish what kind of friendship you two wish have with each other. Get the point?    Be a man and not stalker, talk to her like a man and not a boy and be respectful, because if she were my sister I would beat the crap out of you if you treated her badly.
BNqbOfBsaa	I think your asking for they impossible! There is probably a good chance that he will think your a nympho or something. But there is also a good chance that he won't care and still go for the sex.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	You really can't say it in text.  You have to be looking into his eyes so he can see you're not joking or lying.  Too many people lie in text and get away with it.  Don't give him the chance to do just that.  Look in in the eyes when you talk to him.  This will show him you really care and you're being serious but when the time comes you just tell him the truth and don't leave anything out.    I hope this helps, good luck.|`|rEafx4QTaa	jus let him kno that u arent trying to get into a relationship right now, but you still wana enjoy his company. im sure he will understand|`|UX3xmWc6aa	thats almost every guys dream girl.. no strings attached|`|mz3EuHktaa	All guys like friends with benifits.  that doesn't make you a whore or a nmypho but honest enough to say that you aren't ready to be tied down.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....Example: "Hello again John Doe,  I just wanna be your friend with sexual benefits buster!!!"....what else really?

4lL34wJnaa	The best bridal shower gift I have ever seen was one my cousin received at her shower (they've been married 11 years, so it was definitely memorable!).    She got a basket full of household items.  There was one item for each letter of the alphabet.  It was so cute, even if a lot of it was cleaning supplies!  LOL!  (If I remember correctly, she got container of Ajax for A.)  It was all stuff she actually used which was also great, because so many bridal gifts just sit there and never get used!|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Check out the registry and see what you can get from that and put together in a creative way.  For example, for a friend's shower I bought the bakeware she registered for (muffin tin, cake pans, cooling racks, etc).  I put them all in a wicker laundry basket (which I picked up at Walmart for under $4), with other baking supplies, such as cake mixes, frosting tubs, sprinkles, cupcake liners, oven mitt, etc. and wrapped it all in tulle.  She thought it was the greatest thing and many people commented on how great it looked.  I've also made different themed baskets like that, such as an italian one, with pasta bowls, cheese grater, spaghetti tongs, etc and wrapped them up with nice pasts, quality pasta sauce, olive oil, etc.|`|hkwBR1moaa	It seems people are thinking this is a baby shower... It is a bridal right?  Anyway, someone mentioned a diaper cake.  Since it is a Wedding, I've seen people make ta wedding cake out of towels, hand towels, and washcloths.  That would be crafty and a great gift.  I've also seen people make a groom out of a broom and a bride out of a mop.  That's pretty neat and they're bridal shower gifts.    Another Idea... take their engagement photo and have a local artist paint it on canvas.  How neat is that?|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Get something from their registry|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	fruit of the month club|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	get them something off the registry but then add your own special touch to it.  like, one of my neighbors  got my brother and his now wife a set of mixing bowls and pyrex baking stuff that they had asked for, and in each bowl and pyrex thing, they put a recipie and a few of the ingredients needed to make the recipie.  my brother and his wife LOVE to  cook, so it was one of their favorite  gifts.      think about things like that that your FSIL likes...pick something off the registry, but then go the extra mile to make it special to them.|`|s30Duwdraa	Have you considered a diaper cake?  They are really cool and you can add a bunch of accesories to it... here's a link with pics:    http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&q=d...    If you don't like that idea, something that i usually do is buy one of those baby tubs and fill it with all the necesitties (soap, cloths, jammies, cream, diapers, toys etc).    good luck!|`|5DJcir9saa	Get her something off her registry...that way you know its something she really wants.    Or...if you're crafty, I got a couple of neat gifts that I really enjoyed.  My sister in law made me a scrap book that I can fill with pictures.  The different pages were: hospital, first day home, first halloween, first christmas, etc.  It was very cute!!  Then my cousin made him a book that was basically a family tree.  It started with pictures of my grandma and grandpa, then their kids and spouses and families and so on.  We have a very large family so its a great way for him to learn who everyone is.  My husband actually commented that he would have liked to have that book when I first started bringing him around, so he would know who everyone was! LOL    ** Sorry, I'm usually in the baby section and I answered this for a BABY shower....for a bridal shower, definitely stick to the registry!|`|hvghGmzAaa	what about a little something for her to get down with her man?|`|sGP6s7uraa	Um, check her registry first.  Find something there because that's what the wedding/bridal registry is for.|`|ApHLa19Faa	Check her registry. Even the most creative gifts are useless if the couple doesn't want or need them.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	How about a big basket filled with his and her robes, champagne, slippers, chocolates....|`|c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	Seems some folks didn't see the word "bridal" and thought "baby"..LOL!  I was an Interior Designer myself for 16+ years...one of my favorite wedding gifts that was not from my registry was a beautiful picnic basket (I mean beautiful..) filled with antique wine glasses, REALLY nice champagne, a set of hand done linen napkins (4), Belgian chocolates, a really beautiful throw that coordinated with the napkins, a CD of "love" songs, a gift card stating to stop by our (local) gourmet shop to pick-up a wonderful package of crackers, pate, etc (all our favorites were ordered ahead by the giver)...it also had some small votive holders and candles...a two small plates from my china.  Since the giver knew we were driving to our honeymoon not too far away, this was perfect...and we spread our picnic on the balcony of our hotel room (on the ocean) and had the most romantic picnic on our wedding night...it was perfect...(we didn't get to eat too much at our wedding due to all the "mingling" so the food was WELCOME...and so was the amount of thought put in to it..|`|wvhoS7WDaa	check out gift ideas here  http://bacheloretteplanners.com/bachelor...|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Get her a sexy nightie. With some sort of art deco design, on the nightie.|`|6AIRllZfaa	Usually something off the registry... Most brides to be already have their registries done by their bridal shower.|`|JD6AlK4Caa	check the wedding registry out.    Besides the normal kitchen and linen items  most couples put a few decorative things on the registry.    Have you been in their home?  Whats it like?  find a painting that matches their decor.    Look around her internet profiles . . .you might find a favorite local artist . . .    or ask-(not her obviously)|`|T4uNeAKZaa	Monogrammed towels|`|swg3BhLXaa	If you're close enough to her and feel comfortable, get her some sexy lingerie!    But, if you two are just becoming friends, you could get her some scrap-booking things, since you said she's artsy.     Or, to be different, treat her to a day at a museum with you (perhaps purchase the ticket, if one is needed, and include it with a card). This shows that you are interested in getting to know her and spending time together. You could pair this with another small gift if it's important to you to hand her something other than an envelope.|`|WMEqoENvaa	well it has to be something from the registry, and let it be for the couple usage. it the thought that counts.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	My granddaughter has requested a "Painfully Practical" shower. When we asked what this meant she said mops, brooms, paper towels, tp, laundry detergent, fabric softener,cleaning stuff because they make up so much of the bottom line for the first trip to the grocery.  She said that would be the greatest idea for her. So how about a kitchen trash can of that type of thing?|`|AA11598871	I absolutely agree with a basket of household items.  Stuff that you always use and tend to run out of.  Another really fun thing is to get an ice chest and fill it with fun things that you never seem to have but need.  I got one for my bridal shower and it had all kinds of crazy stuff.  A toilet plunger, liquid plumr, windex, baby wipes, emergency first aid kit, flash light,  stuff like that, that you seem to forget but that you definitley need in an emergency, no matter what the emergency may be.

hiOeQZVsaa	this is why people should have sex before marriage!      If he doesn't know how to have sex, then it is up to you to teach him!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	He is either:  Totally gay or totally having an affair with another woman.|`|gYyW39wTaa	Teach him how to kiss and go to marriage counselling together|`|c3DqvgE4aa	Are you mad?|`|R4F05z4Faa	The reason is only Peoria. thatswhy he never kissed you.he feels his pennis is small thatswhy he never tried sex.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	that must b a really hard time for you..those 5 years...but its never too late..dont loose hope...u can talk to him about how u feel...and u can always teach him wateva u want...if the situation still doesnt improve..i wud suggest u go to a marriage counsellor...all d best|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Get with a counselor ASAP!  You need help sorting out WHY he is not into you sexually - so you can figure out how to turn him on and please him.|`|b9y851NHaa	show him all those movies.....  Even then he is not motivated, it s better way 2take divorce.... Sorry, i dnt hav another solution...|`|as422qT4aa	Most of the sexual problems are psychological in nature.    Over five years you might have come across how your husband reacts to a woman's sexuality.  If he is close with women while talking, chitchatting with sisters, coleagues, neighbours or ladies at work... observe where he concentrates.  Is he particular about the dress, the hair, the face, the breasts or the pelvic area.  Definitely he will have some interest in some part of a woman's body or decoration.  You should concentrate yourself with that.    Next you take more interest to adjust yourself to his tastes and thus cause some interest in you.    The second method is to develop some sort of intimacy, slowly going towards nudity in private for both, in steps only.    If his behaviour shows something special, an aversion to some excess nudity etc then investigate upto what he likes and limit to that extent.    Arousal is always possible with bodily contacts.  Sleep together with the least clothing.  If he has some erection problems, there are plenty of techniques like applying some oil, massaging, sucking, and rubbing between breasts.  This will definitely improve the stimulation.    Kissing is an art.  It need not start from  a man.... You are now more intimate... you can make a start.  Start from a gentle kiss on the cheeks, on the chin, on the forehead, on the nose, and occasionally on the lips (not in the beginning).      Kissing with a good embrace will always improve relationships.  Talk to each other on the beach sand, on a river side, on a bench in a public park etc.  More private interaction will help.  If he comes out with a health problem then see a doctor without any hesitation.    It is always better to take medical help instead of living a lame life.|`|uAnwCqrJaa	I doubt if he is a man. Divorce and marry a man.|`|IXskJPlVaa	5 years married - without sex - weired. Either he is impotent or gay? Impotence is mostly curable and if gay that is also curable. In both cases - professional help is the only way out - for impotence - go to a sex therapist else a couple counsellor. That is the best you can do to save you marriage. Best of luck.|`|86Bb8CDraa	Try to make him feel... you know. Touch him and stuff, talk sweet. It's nothing hard. He'll get so turned on that he'll end up expressing his love in the best way he can.
aKkDWz5Waa	The truth? well ull hate me if i turn out wrong but i think although Laura's embarassed, she wants him to know. She won't hate u too much for telling him, she might even feel better about it- well the fact that he knows anyways.     But she should know who he is. If her crush on him is major it's probably too late for her feelings to change but at least she'll know the truth. Dont keep it from her, its whats best. sorry if she does get mad at u.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	hes playing the 3 of you .. get him back .. tell her ..|`|9en6c7cRaa	Speaking from experience, it seems your options are very limited. I always tell people to live life to the fullest, but some times you have to sit back and let things take their course. Pretend as though you didn't tell the others, and eventually things we'll work themselves out to where you can just explain to her why you didn't tell her. Things get a lot like quick sand sometimes, and you the more you fight against it, the faster you sink. Just relax and you'll sink a lot slower and it'll give you time to find a way out. Hope this helped.    Sincerely, Fossegrim|`|QAccD2Mxaa	totally ..he is playing gams ..get him back .tell her pls do .|`|JCdBSULraa	This is why you shouldn't play stupid games with peoples' emotions.   What makes you think it was ok to date this guy to hurt his feelings?  So that you could hook him up with a girl he wouldn't have liked anyway?  There's no easy way out of it, all of you are going to get what you deserved for being manipulative.   Admittedly, you seem to be the only level-headed person in the group, but you should not have stood by while these girls were scheming to hurt this guy and take advantage of him.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...don't be the third wheel in anything hun...( except for a tricycle ) in fact this really isn't your specific problem here honestly....it's Laura's problem....soon to be Sara's...what else?  Robert is simply the male cadd in all of this mystical stuff....nothing more!  My theory?...stay out of troubles way?...and it won't BE your trouble anymore........sound cool?|`|3PFJGzzsaa	sounds like he is a dog. dnt hurt ur friend 4 him.|`|iJZyrk1daa	You need to be honest with you friend. She may be upset but at least she will know who is truly her friend.  be the friend who will never lie or play games with her and you will have a friend for life.  Also, you need to tell this guy that under no circumstances will you go out with him and that he should leave you alone as it makes you uncomfortable.
QIQNzE11aa	One, no one can be mentally stable if they were raped by their father and never got help for it. She needs some serious help.    Two, she was with her ex a year and a half ago. This was supposedly when she wasn't with you yet. So you two haven't been together that long. How about you post pone the wedding for another year?     that she says she slept with this ex of hers to get revenge on him seems utterly odd. How would sleeping with a man be vengeful? I am fully apt to believe that she was lonely and maybe even scared to be completely alone. He was getting to sleep with her and other women, so how was her hurt by it all? He wasn't. There was no revenge.. maybe she started out that way.. maybe she hoped to hurt him with it somehow. But in the end, she was just going back on her own to get something out of it for herself.     That isn't something  you tell another person up front. Hey, did you know i was sleeping wiht my ex while i was single? See how that wouldn't be something to bring up? She had no reason to tell you and shouldn't have told you anything. Just omitted and not made up a lie to cover for it. But again, she felt low about it and didn't want you to know. Besides, no one knows in the beginning if it will work out. So she chose to tell a lie. A lie that she felt she must come clean on now, before you two get married. She wants nothing inbetween you.     BUT... back to her father. If she truly had this horrific event happen, she needs help. I am saying, post pone the wedding for at least a year while you insist she goes to counseling. You take her to counseling as well. sit in the waiting room so you know she goes in with the dr.   People like her are taught to never tell and may go to extreme lenghts to make you think she's getting help while not really going. Make certain she is getting help. Once you two make it to the other side of that, then you will feel secure once again and can proceed with the wedding. There's plenty of time to put off the wedding until next year. No one will freak if you bump the date, only if you cancelled. Well, she'll freak, but tell her that you need to know she's working out her past incestuous rape problems. Forgiving a father for doing this and being around him as if nothign happened isnt' healthy. She probably was told she caused it and probably believes it. Though, betting she knows the right things to say if you asked. But deep down, she believes she is part of that problem instead of the victim.     Don't just throw this away. Things can be worked through and it sounds like you really love her but the father issue sounds like a huge punch in the face to handle. But you are strong and you can help her get help. Even if it doesn't work out for you next year, you'll know you got her on the road to some recovery. Best of luck.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	The past is in the past. Let it go and help her out with the rape thing. I'm sure she has bottled feelings about it since she's never talked about it with anyone.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Wow your a lucky guy! she is letting you know who your marrying before you get married. its call being totally honest, More relationships would last if we had that. Hang on this one my friend she's a good one.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Add her childhood to her past with her ex and you have a very unstable woman, unless she's been in serious counseling for years.  Take that at face value and consider getting her into counseling.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Whether you trust her or not is completely up to you. I suppose everyone has their own skeletons but whether she's trustworthy or not, only you know this. This is based off her other actions, if you're always suspicious of her then of course you shouldn't trust her. But keep your eyes open anyway. Everyone is trying to give your fiance credit for being absolutely honest when she lied about her relationship in the first place. It's common sense that anyone would raise a brow. Big difference between her relationship with her father's child being over 6 years ago vs. virtually last year. If this were your fiance saying you lied about your relationship, I guarantee you most of these answers would be radically different.    About her father, if she didn't ask your advice then there is none to give. Rapist usually don't apologize for raping, so I don't think she can bank on an apology without taking action of her own. We like to assume that women are psychologically scarred after being raped, but that is not the case with all women. If she is past it then she just is. Believe me I know. Been with a rape survivor for the last 6 years, she didn't need counseling nor is she carrying around emotional baggage from it. You cannot just tell another person they are traumatized and need counseling simply because something happened. Counseling is for coping, if she coped no need for counseling.    However, if she doesn't have closure from this and ever wants to confront her father then just be her rock and have her back. You love her, but this isn't your battle to lead the charge. At the same time if this man can rape his own 11 year old daughter there could be other kids at risk, namely your future children so this issue might come up when grandma starts to wonder why your kids can never spend the weekend with them.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think you two should take your time getting to know each other and seeing if this is truly what you want before you get married.  It's great that she is opening up to you about her past.  That is how you build a solid, loving foundation for the relationship.  However, it's better to hold off on getting engaged for at least a year or so there's time for all this stuff to come out and so that you know what you're getting into before you get married.  It sounds like you made the mistake of jumping into the commitment faster than taking the time to get to know each other.     I know this isn't your current question, but I also browsed through your past questions.  The other thing that concerns me is that you refer to her daughter as a brat.  When you marry somebody with a young child, you are getting a package deal, and you have to love both of them.  If you resent her child, it will cause problems down the line, and your wife will resent you for it.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Get out fast. Sounds like she is lying and has emotional problems. Seriously. You are the only person she ever told about her father? That is BS. Sorry man, but she sounds like she will be dangerous to marry.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	That is big. I wouldn't marry her. If you had children with her, her father may hurt them. If he can rape his own daughter what is to stop him for hurting anyone else? Yes, it all happened before you met her but I bet if you knew all this before you proposed you wouldn't have proposed.     Think about it. Do you really want to be connected to that for the rest of your life and your future children? She needs some therapy.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Follow your heart dont let no one else follow it for you.|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	well..first off if you love her stand bye her,,she is trusting you..if you say you are her first real realtiosnhip..obviously her faith in the father figure is shattered,,and she is leaning on you..do not let her down with jealousy and anger..you cant be jealous over things before you met..  maybe telling you about her father is her way of finally seeking help with whats eating her insdie..  i could not sit in the same room with him knowing this,,and she needs to know what you think of him NOW upfront..i dont know where you are from..or the laws there but i dont about statute of limitations on rape..if i was you i would send an anonymous letter to him saying you know what he did to his daughter make him sweat..or to her mother..someone needs to make this man pay for his crimes,,CRIMES. and your fiance is hurting insdie,,thats why she went back and forth with that guy when she was lonely..  you are now he father figure in her life and she trusts you with what kills her inside..do not be angry with her,,she did nothing wrong..she is seeking help in her own way,,be strong, love her , support her and hold her hand through this,,seek some therapy for her..tell her it will help her..but you need to come to terms with your hatred and anger to her father,,that is something that will kill you inside,,he needs to be held responsible for his crimes..without hurting your fiance anymore..  good luck..but mostly..support her and respect her wishes..over time maybe you can get her to deal with it more..if you love her..then love her with all you have..no matter what..but she needs to know how you feel about her father and how you cant stand to be face to face with him without wanting to kill him..for her to try to aoid you and him together..  good luck|`|T6nvpX6zaa	Seriously - you need to get to counseling with her, or at least get her to go.  The counselor will want to have some sessions alone with her either way.    My wife was raped, once, by a relative when she was pretty young.  She reacted the opposite of your wife - she didn't have sex with boys, didn't like dating, and wasn't ready for marriage until after she got a lot of counseling... but she is an AMAZING sexual partner.  It is because she got her mixed up emotions figured out with the help of counseling.    You should feel AWESOME that she is being open with you.  That tells me she really trusts you and wants a real, true, committed relationship with you.  As soon as possible, you need to plan a special time with her - I don't mean elaborate - it could be a simple dinner at your house tonight, meeting for lunch tomorrow - but something that is just you and her with a chance to talk.  Tell her how blown away you are that she trusts you like that, how you respect the risk she is taking in sharing those things and how loved you feel that she picked you to share those things.  Tell her you cannot imagine how those experiences made her feel, and you want to protect her and help her overcome any hurts she may still have from those experiences.  Tell her you want your marriage to be a secure place where both of you can bring your hardest things and find love, caring, acceptance.  Then ask her how she has handled those things all these years - and let her talk.  Keep asking questions.  Ask if she has ever sought counseling.   What does she think about counseling?  Tell her you really want to help, you are concerned about what happened with her father and would like to go to a counselor together so you can find out how to best help her as her husband to grow and overcome these things - that you think it could really help you both start the marriage on a rock solid foundation.  Make sure you finish, regardless of how this conversation goes, telling her you are incredibly moved by how much she trusts you with things that are the hardest for her, that you love her, and think she has set a great foundation for building a strong relationship on honesty and trust.    And have that conversation soon, because she just spilled her guts about her toughest things, and she's going to be wondering how you feel, and maybe even freaking out a little bit.  The sooner you can reassure her that you want to know her hurts and regrets, the better it will help your relationship.|`|kubIYab1aa	I can understand why you would feel as if you cant trust her but think about it, if all this was going on before you met her then why should it affect you? If in your heart you feel that she has been faithful to you the whole time you have been together then there shouldn't be a problem. Think about all the things you have done in the past do you want her to judge you for all you have done? See everyone has made messed up choices thats just life you cant hold that against her as long as she loves you and does right by you then you need not worry.    As for the situatuion with her being raped by her father..Im just shocked. See in my opinion she should have told what was going on regardless of what the circumstances were. She might have been afraid but what he did was utterly wrong and its discusting that a man can do such a thing to anyone let alone his own blood. The thing that gets to me is that she still lives in the same house with him and she has an 8 yr old daughter!!?? is she out of her mind! Its one thing to want to forgive someone thats her business because if that was me i would have put the mother fu@*er on blast and told the whole world what a low life scum of the earth he is but its another thing to risk your own child and still live under the same roof as a sexual affender has she no shame? See im not trying to put anyone down, I know and understand that fear that she might of had inside of her i been in a similar situation, not quite the same but similar and i chose to open my mouth and i'll be damed if I will ever in my life talk to them again....if you marry her you take her and have kids...you take her *** away from that man, matter of fact when you marry her your accepting her child as yours so you take them both away from that enviornment.|`|uJma1z78aa	If you are seriously thinking about calling off a marriage over this, you should.  I say that because neither of these things are worth getting upset over.  Maybe you should evaluate your level of commitment.  It doesn't matter if she was sleeping with a guy before you came along.  It's not like she cheated on you.  Many people lie to make themselves sound better in the beginning of a relationship, it sounds like that's all she did.  The fact that she told you the truth shows that she is serious and committed to you.  It also means that she doesn't want any dishonesty between the 2 of you, which is awsome.  As for the father thing, talk to her about it, encourage her to get professional help, and don't ever let your children be alone with him.|`|29hcn9JRaa	So does this mean that after you get married she is going to hit ya with another, oh by the way I again have another secret that I would like to share story? This girl has many issues and baggage, the fact that she was raped by her own father means that she will be somewhat dysfunctional her entire life, and don't get me wrong, I am not saying that she is going to be out of her head and crazy, I am merely stating that most adults who have been raped as children tend to have way more issues with trust, emotions, and success in life, however if she is in therapy these issues typically get better. Her track record with her ex simply wreaks of again, more dysfunction, but this is your choice, don't just get married and overlook all these issues, as they are important, as these situations that have happened to her in her life are critical to her mental health today. I also see that her and her father have tried to minimize his disgusting actions by sweeping them under the rug, bad deal, really bad. All of this stuff would make me question her character, and make me start reconsider the possibility of marriage?  If you were my son, brother, or friend, my advise would be to step back from the notion of marriage for a bit longer, and don't allow her or anyone else to put the guilt trip on you to reconsider. Also many people with this much baggage also have poor credit as they lack responsibility, so be smart and run a credit check on her, this is something that everyone should do prior to marriage, but don't think about it till it is to late. Play it smart, reconsider.|`|1474ddd3aa450daf673bdee63169f0ccaa	I advise seeing a marriage councilor before getting married, possibly even having her visit a mental health therapist for some type to assessment of her mental health. She may have a lot of issues she needs to deal with before she can be a truly good wife to you.     If she is healthy mentally, after all that she has been through she is one really strong woman, and a good choice for you.    Edit: I really like the comments by mailpail... it is several places below mine.
