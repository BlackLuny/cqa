20090226101341AAZW2xI	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What are my options for a stolen air intake by Walmart service station?	I posted earlier what I have found, and although my husband hasn't confirmed yet, but I think Wal-Mart service station stole my air intake that sits on top of my engine.  I noticed it this morning when my car wouldn't start (because of a fuel relay issue) anyway when I popped the hood I thought something looked wrong (I know nothing about engines) and my husband knows very little but a coworker and another poster told me that it is the air intake.  Anyway, if it turns out that it is missing that means when wal-mart changed my oil...around 1,000 miles ago they took it off and left it off and I live on a gravel road and drive at least 40 miles a day, so who knows how much dirt and crap I have sucked into my oil.  What should I do to prove and get a new air intake and what happens if it has damaged my engine?  How can I prove it if it is still currently running and then something happens 6 months down the road...I just want to know what I can do to make them responsible for their mistake...and there was another one at the same time with my tire (a pair of pliers were left in it), needless to say I will not be going back to wal-mart to work at all on my car

Likes and dislikes? does it comfortably hold 3 people in the back seat or is the middle person squished? (I carry round one adult and two children in booster seats and sometimes I have one extra adult and I need to know if there is room enough for a middle person.) And problems mechanically? State farm quoted me at 250 a month on insurance (only one speeding ticket ) on the versa SE. do you have a the standard or SE and how much does your insurance usually run and with who so if that is normal then i'm gonna keep shopping cause that is ridicules.      Right now I have a 05 chevy classic (crappy cant keep it out of the shop ugh!!!) and I have full coverage and it runs me roughly 300 every 3 months. 24 yo by the way. I really like farm bureau but they could only quote me if I had a vin for the model I was looking at and I wanted someone Else's opinion before I took the trouble and got the vin.

I have a sport Ka with a very nice stainless steel gear knob which is very pretty and everything but is a pain in the butt when it's really cold or really hot!

It's not what I'd call rough, more like a hiccup... it'll be smooth, then do its subtle little grunt, then be fine for a few more seconds. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason, but I'd say the little shake happens about every 15 seconds.       I wouldn't think it'd be a transmission problem since it doesn't seem to happen while in drive when idling (but correct me if I'm wrong).      I just got the car (it's an 04), and it's the first one I've had with an engine larger than 1.8L. My Dad says not to worry about it... and even though I've had cars shake a little before, I've never had one do it in such a pattern.

Hi   Today i had my driving test, which i failed (partly due to my nervousness), at the end, i slammed the car door (not very hard) when i got out (as i was angry with my self)  after i got back in the car with my instructor to go home, and he started having a massive go at me about it, shouting at me and everything, then i got upset and he insulted me telling me to be a man (he laughed nastily at this point) so i told him to shut up, he then preceded to be nasty to me and shouting calling me a stupid little boy, telling me i'm not a nice person etc.   anyway i find this unforgivable when i have been paying him. so is there any website where i can leave feedback about his company (i live in the UK). i don't want this to happen to other people. the only rude thing i said to him was shut up. when we were nearly home i asked if he could let me out but he wouldn't and kept driving, surely thats illegal. i'm sad its resorted to this but i don't want him to upset other people. i admit i shouldn't have slammed the door, but i apologised straight away when he started to shout (i didn't expect him to have a go as i did it as a reflex action and not a very hard slam)   I can't report him to the company as the company solely consists of just him and one other instructor, i'm looking for a website where i can put a review of the company and instructor or something   thank you

20090226152528AAngev0	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;BMW	Just bought a 328xi - and noticed a chip in the windshield!?	I did bring it back to the dealership and they said that they wouldn't worry about it and that they would not suggest replacing the windshield.  So now I have to call my insurance company to see if I have glass insurance and bring it to a glass company to fill the hole.  Is this normal - for them to just fill the hole in the windshield?  Sorry if this is a dumb question... just not sure how the process works.  Thanks in advance!

20090226150036AAtHyfY	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Can I sell a trailer with no title?	Long story short. My boyfriends Dad bought a house and on the property was a trailer. He told us if we got it off the property we could sell it. We’re now trying to sell it but people keep asking us for a title. We don’t have a title because like I said the trailer came with the house. Do we need a title for the trailer or can we in fact sell it without the title? If I do need it how do I go about getting one? Also I have looked the trailer up and down and it has no maker, no stickers, no anything that can tell me who made it or owned it. And I am not sure if this helps but we live in Louisiana.       Thanks, - Mo

20090225112311AAthMDa	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is a head gasket covered under a motor warranty?	My daughter recently bought a 2005 Nissan Sentra.  The check engine light came on the 2nd day she had it. Then it overheated the next day and she got stranded on the expressway.  She took it to the dealership and was told she had air pockets in the radiator.  They flushed the system and she was okay after that... at least for the day.  The next day, heat doesn't work, temp gauge fluctuates pretty wildly, but not actually overheating.  She is also now having acceleration issues. I suspect it's a blown head gasket.  The dealership gave her a lifetime motor and trans warranty.  If it IS the head gasket, is this something that would generally covered by this type of warranty?

20090226150543AAFx7nT	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I replaced my alternator and battery but my battery light is still on and I feel my van is losing power?	Yesterday when I started my van (2001 Chrysler Town & Country) the battery light came on. I drove for about 10 minutes, parked and the van died. i kept trying to start it and it was just clicking.      I put in a new battery and it started but the light came on and it felt like it was going to die again so I drove it to a shop. They told me it needed a new alternator and they put one in. When I left I drove for about 2 minutes and the battery light came on again. They told me it might take some time to shut off so wait and see.      This morning I drove to school (5 minutes away) the battery light didn't come on. When I left school on my break ,to drive home (5 minutes) the battery light came on within two minutes of driving.  I went back to school right after and the light was on the whole time. I had to turn my headlights on and everything inside the van got dim.       Also, it was idling at about 1,000 before all this. Now its at 500.      Can anyone help me? I am going to bring it back to the place that fixed the alternator  tomorrow, but I don't want to have to pay for something else that might not be the problem.      Thank you!!

20090226152903AAtcxQn	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Ford Escort 1998 Keyless Entry not working?	Hi there, I purchased a keyless entry remote for my girlfriends 1998 Ford Escort and it's not working.      I think the receiver chip is somehow broken and not picking up the signal, if so where would that even be located to look? and is it possible to replace?      The car does have keyless entry, she used to have a remote and said it stopped working and then she lost it. I called Ford and got them to decode my vin just to double check the part number was right on the remote, and it is. It was, and so now I'm here with a remote that isn't working.      When the keys are in the ignition the car goes bing bing bing, but if I press down the little rubber thing on the side of the door that stops. So I'm going to assume that means the door is shut and everything. I tried it while holding that down, but it still didn't work. Is it possible that the receiver chip is bad or broken? Does anyone know where it is located?      The car does successfully go into programming mode, with the doors unlocking and re locking after turning the ignition off and on 8 times and ending in run.  I have tried ending in Off as well, to no avail.
